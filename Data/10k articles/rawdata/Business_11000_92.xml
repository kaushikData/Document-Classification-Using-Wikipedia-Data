In [[public administration]], '''administrative discretion''' refers to the flexible exercising of judgment and decision making allowed to public administrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Administrative Discretion |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of public administration and public policy |year=2003 |page=35 |publisher=Dekker |location=New York |last=Rabin |first=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cann&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cann|first1=Steven|title=The Administrative State, the Exercise of Discretion, and the Constitution|journal=Public Administration Review|date=July 2007|volume=67|issue=4|pages=780–782|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2007.00760.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory agencies have the power to exercise this type of discretion in their day-to-day activities, and there have been cases where regulatory agencies have abused this power. Administrative law can help these agencies get on the path of following regulations, serve the public, and in turn, a reflection of the public's values and beliefs.

There's a need for administrative discretion because the public’s interest could be at risk if several agencies were not following laws and regulations. Administrative discretion is important because without it, it could lead to arbitrary and unreasonable use of such discretion, which may lead to destruction of basic principles of administrative law.&lt;ref name=Vaishnav&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vaishnav |first=S. |last2=Marwaha |first2=K. |year=2015|title=Judiciary: A Ladder between Inevitable Administrative Discretion and Good Governance |journal=International Journal of Multidisciplinary Approach &amp; Studies |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=63–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this type of discretion isn't laid out in the job-description of a bureaucrat/public servant, it is necessary because citizens use these bureaucratic institutions every day; such as the D.M.V. , public schooling, and numerous others. [[street-level bureaucracy|Street-level bureaucrats]] have to deal with the provision of service as well as translating vaguely worded mandates into specific cohesive and comprehensive language to organize protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sowa|first1=Jessica E.|last2=Selden|first2=Sally Coleman|title=Administrative Discretion and Active Representation: An Expansion of the Theory of Representative Bureaucracy|journal=Public Administration Review|date=November 2003|volume=63|issue=6|pages=700–710|doi=10.1111/1540-6210.00333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative discretion allows agencies to use professional expertise and judgment when making decisions or performing official duties, as opposed to only adhering to strict regulations or statuses. For example, a public official has administrative discretion when he or she has the freedom to make a choice among potential courses of action. The failure to exercise reasonable judgment or discretion is abuse of discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Administrative Discretion |encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law |year=2005 |accessdate=21 April 2015 |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3437700153.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"I think that in our system of government, where law ends, tyranny need not begin. Where law ends, discretion begins, and the exercise of discretion may mean either beneficence or tyranny, either justice or injustice, either reasonableness or arbitrariness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Discretionary Justice: A preliminary inquiry |last = Davis|first = Kenneth C.|publisher = LSU Press|year = 1969|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;—Kenneth Culp Davis

==History==

The idea of administrative discretion dates back as far as the time of widely known Greek philosopher [[Socrates]] in his quest to lay the foundation for philosophical ethics. Socrates determined a general ranking of "universal morals" in order to piece together certain criterion that could test what course of action to take in any immediate situation. He assigned value orders as well as certain "means to ends" that would determine alternatives for ethical philosophical generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leys|first1=Wayne A. R.|title=Ethics and Administrative Discretion|journal=Public Administration Review|date=Winter 1943 |volume=3|issue=1|pages=10|doi=10.2307/973098|jstor=973098}}&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, Socrates was creating the first type of basis for administrative discretion. 
[[File:Andrew Jackson 1873 Issue-2c.jpg|thumb|Andrew Jackson 1873 Postage Stamp—US Postal Service]]
When [[Andrew Jackson]] took office in 1829, the country was going through radical changes—the scale of government grew extensively which caused the need for an increase in the administrative activity. Jackson brought the bureaucratization of administration.&lt;ref name=Mashaw&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mashaw|first1=Jerry L.|title=Administration and "The Democracy": Administrative Law from Jackson to Lincoln, 1829-1861|journal=The Yale Law Journal|date=1 June 2008|volume=117|issue=8|pages=1568|doi=10.2307/20454693|jstor=20454693}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appointed his close friends to office to work in administered processes. This was known as the "spoils system", in which was a system was in place where presidential administrations had the power of hiring or firing federal workers; this brought a constant change in demands and routines for personnel. Of his additions to the administrative discretion and of bureaucracy as we know it today, one in particular, the creation of [[History of United States patent law#Patent Act of 1836|The Patent Reform Act of 1836]] brought about the creation of new offices and adjudicatory administrative boards.  Although, perhaps unknowingly, Jackson brought a new age to administrative discretion. Another president who has come in contact with administrative discretion is Madison. Known as Madison's Managers, drafted in 1787, some argue that early public administration literature had it right.&lt;ref name=Cann/&gt;

After Jackson, many presidents followed suit of his example—appointing members to administrative processes. In some cases, officials appointed by the presidents abused their powers in administration. There were attempts to control administrative discretion throughout the 19th century, but those attempts overall, failed. Political appointees believed they indeed were law themselves—Jesse Hoyt and his successor Samuel Swartwout for example, notoriously did not comply with the rule to return funds they had collected on behalf of the Federal Government.&lt;ref name=Mashaw/&gt; However, within the 20th century, substantial changes occurred that better formed the concept of administrative discretion as we know it today.

[[Franklin Roosevelt]]’s New Deal brought much needed relief to the public by implementing welfare programs in a dire time of crisis. There was a type of bureaucratic "sprawl": this era saw the creation of numerous agencies and boards. The birth of such a large bureaucracy, not only helped in aiding the public, but Roosevelt’s programs also answered important question of who would be part of the bureaucracy and govern future welfare programs. The New Deal emphasized the importance of administrative discretion in government and their processes by expanding the staff of the White House and creating new managerial techniques for the executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Morone |first=J. A. |year=1998 |title=The Democratic Wish: Popular participation and the limits of American government |publisher=Yale University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|The Administrative Procedure Act of 1946]] was created to govern the internal procedures of administrative agencies and how those agencies interact with the public. The act came about after the Attorney General appointed a committee to investigate the need for procedural reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Marble |first=R. D. |year=1948 |title=Federal Administrative Procedure Act of 1946 |journal=Mississippi Law Journal |volume=20 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of the time (not too far off-base of popular public notion today) was that various agencies were created by Congress over a long period of time in a piece-mail, haphazard manner. The view was that there was no uniformity in the chaotic bodies to administer anything. The 1946 act places policies on agencies’ rule-making, adjudications, and licensing behavior. The intention was to make sure that the public is protected and safe, with secured proper entitlements.

==Examples of administrative discretion in law==
[[File:Compiègne Justice.jpg|thumb|Compiègne Justice]]
''[[Goldberg v. Kelly]]''—In this 1970 case, City officials were administrating and terminating public assistance benefits under the federally assisted program of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and/or under New York State’s Home Relief Program in New York City. The problem arose as residents receiving financial aid claimed that the New York City officials overseeing and administering these programs terminated their aid without notifying them or holding a hearing. Recipients alleged that this was unconstitutional on the Administration's part because it denying them due process of law guaranteed under the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment (Case Briefs). In this case, Administrative Discretion resulted in individualized parameters of what was deemed necessary to convey a termination of aid, instead of a federal standard. The Holding of Chief Justice Warren Burger and the court sided with the appellants' view: a full hearing of evidence is required before a recipient can be denied/deprived of certain types of government benefits. In other words, a recipient must receive some sort of notice should their aid be changed/terminated; whether in writing or orally.

''[[Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute|Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute-]]-''In this 1980, [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]] (or OSHA), The Secretary of Labor was required to explicitly state exposure risks/limits at the lowest level of carcinogens that won't impair viability of the industries regulated. However, this failed to happen. The Secretary did not say or record anywhere that exposure to the substance benzene at 10 ppm (parts per million) would cause leukemia and exposure to 1 ppm would not (Oyez cases). The holding of the Supreme Court, under Justice Warren Burger, concluded that there was a statute for a requirement of significant risk, and the Secretary and agency had failed to uphold the statue of workers' health at risks.&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=M. |title=Administrative Discretion: The Next Stage |journal=Yale Law Journal |volume=92 |page=1487 |year=1982 |url=https://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2706&amp;context=facpubs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Administrative Discretion under the Secretary of Labor had not understood the "extent feasible" .

''[[Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe|Citizens To Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v Volpe]]--''In this 1971 case, in Memphis, Tennessee, a group of citizens claimed that The Secretary of Transportation made the decision to have construction of a highway where Overton Park was located and violated statutes enacted by the congress.&lt;ref name=Shapiro/&gt; The court holding under justice Burger upheld the "feasible and prudent" clause: wherein an alternative exists to circumvent building the proposed highway through the park. Furthermore, the Secretary's decision to use federal money for the highway did not comply with the Department of Transportation Act of 1966.

''[[IRS targeting controversy|The IRS Tea Party Controversy]]'': The IRS must exercise discretion in administering the tax law. The IRS oversees a vast system that affects nearly everyone. Since the law is complex and often difficult to interpret, the IRS must draw fine lines in order to properly interpret, apply, and enforce the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahng |first=L.|year=2013 |title=The IRS Teas Party Controversy and Administrative Discretion |journal= Cornell Law Review Online |url=http://cornelllawreview.org/files/2013/09/99CLRO411.pdf  |volume=99 |pages=41–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRS claims it gave extra scrutiny to Tea Party-affiliated groups based solely on the name and goals of the groups. The IRS asked those groups invasive questions that were not normally asked of other groups: about their donor lists, affiliations and contacts with the media .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Korte |first=G. |date=13 May 2013 |title=Q&amp;A: The IRS-Tea Party scandal explained |accessdate=2015-04-13 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/05/13/irs-tea-party-scandal-explained/2156009/ |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative Discretion in Criminal Law Enforcement''--'' When a government official of law enforcement uses their own sense of ethical discretion such as not to or to invoke in criminal process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Judith|title=International law and domestic institutions: reconciling North American "unfair" trade laws|journal=International Organization|date=22 May 2009|volume=50|issue=4|pages=541|doi=10.1017/s0020818300033506}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two major situational motivations of police discretion; whether police response is internally invoked or citizen initiated and whether it is a law enforcement of order maintenance situation. The two situational motivations combine to create four types of discretionary situations for law enforcement officials. The four different situations are proactive and reactive law enforcement and proactive and reactive order maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reiss|first1=Albert J.|title=Consequences of Compliance and Deterrence Models of Law Enforcement for the Exercise of Police Discretion|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Autumn 1984|volume=47|issue=4|pages=83|doi=10.2307/1191688|jstor=1191688|url=https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol47/iss4/5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day administrative discretion==
{{OR section|date=May 2015}}
In today’s administrative discretion, some issues affect the way organizations function and the way the public feels towards administrations/agencies as a whole. In this way public administrators are seen as "moral agents"; they are given the task to exercise discretion, and reflect the society’s values.  In theory, the public expects administrators to be the exemplary role models of society and follow laws and regulations. [[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010
"We want dialogue and transparency."
]]In reality, some do not think the administrators play fair and the public feels distrusts towards them. In a poll done by Gallup.com, the public showed an increase in the mistrust in government. People were asked if corruption was widespread throughout the government. The results recorded from 2006 to 2013 rose significantly; from 56% to 79%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clifton|first1=Jon|title=Americans Less Satisfied With Freedom|url=http://news.gallup.com/poll/172019/americans-less-satisfied-freedom.aspx|publisher=Gallup|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public may know little to nothing about the administration or their responsibilities, yet approval is very low. Some{{who|date=May 2015}} attribute this mistrust to a lack of transparency, where corruption can occur.&lt;ref name=Vaishnav/&gt; The lack of transparency can mean that an administration is not completely honest, secretly keeping hidden agendas: withholding information from public view. It can also simply mean that the administration does not attempt to make their information easy to access or understand for the public.

'''Arthur Charles Nielsen Sr.''' (September 5, 1897{{spaced ndash}}June 1, 1980) was an American businessman, electrical engineer and market research analyst who founded the [[ACNielsen|ACNielsen company]], a market research company.

==Background==
Arthur Charles Nielsen was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He was of [[Danish people|Danish]] descent. Nielsen was educated at University of Wisconsin (now [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]), where he received a B.S., summa cum laude in 1918. He was a member of [[Tau Beta Pi]] (engineering honor society), the [[Sigma Phi|Sigma Phi Society]] and a captain of the [[Varsity team|varsity]] [[tennis]] team from 1916 to 1918. He subsequently served in U.S. Naval Reserve.

==Career==
Nielsen worked as an electrical engineer for the Isko Company in Chicago from 1919 to 1920 and for the H. P. Gould Company in Chicago from 1920 to 1923. He founded the [[ACNielsen]] company in 1923, and in doing so advanced the new field of [[marketing research|market research]]. This involved: (1.) [[test market]]ing new products to determine their viability prior to costly [[mass marketing]] and production; and (2.) measuring product sales at a [[random sample]] of stores to determine [[market share]].  Careful [[statistical sampling]] was crucial to this process.  The techniques developed by Nielsen were especially important for the efficient operation of a [[Market (economics)|market]] prior to the introduction of computerized [[digital network]]s that in the 1990s enabled continuous and comprehensive monitoring of sales by product retailers. Nielsen was also a pioneer in developing methods of measuring the audience of radio and [[television broadcasting]] programs, most notably the [[Nielsen ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;'' A.C. Nielsen. U.S. Media Market Researcher'' (The Museum of Broadcast Communications) [http://www.museum.tv/eotv/nielsenac.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen inaugurated a National Radio Index for broadcasters and advertisers in 1942, followed by a television ratings service in 1950. By the time of his death, the company's revenue was US$398 million annually.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,924209,00.html Milestones, Jun. 16, 1980]", ''Time'', June 16, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
With his son Arthur Nielsen Jr. he won the U.S. Father and Son doubles tennis titles in 1946 and 1948. He was elected to the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1971 for his contributions to the sport. The University of Wisconsin awarded him an honorary Doctor of Science (ScD) in 1974. Nielsen was appointed a Knight of the [[Order of the Dannebrog]], ''Ridder af Dannebrog'' (1961) by the government of [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;''North American Medal Recipient Index'' (The Order of Dannebrog and other Royal Scandinavian medals by William P. Jones) {{cite web|url=http://www.danishmuseum.org/fhgc/resources/Danish-American_medal_index.pdf |title=Danish Maerican Medal|accessdate=2009-08-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725215719/http://www.danishmuseum.org/fhgc/resources/Danish-American_medal_index.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nielsen and his wife Gertrude (d.1998) donated the Nielsen Tennis Stadium to the University of Wisconsin–Madison.&lt;ref&gt;University of Wisconsin-Madison. [http://www.recsports.wisc.edu/nielsen.html Nielsen Tennis Stadium] retrieved 19 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the A.C. Nielsen family made a donation to UW-Madison to create a full-time MBA program specializing in market research. It is the only full-time market research program in the United States.  A small tennis center in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], is named after him.

Sankar was born at [[Cornelia Ida]], in what is now the [[Essequibo Islands-West Demerara]] region of Guyana, but was then considered to be part of the county of [[Demerara]] in [[British Guiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/24/24121/24121.html Beni Sankar playing statistics] – CricketArchive.

Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Beni Sankar studied at England's [[National College of Agricultural Engineering]] in [[Silsoe]], [[Bedfordshire]], graduating in 1974, and entered his father's employment, eventually becoming CEO of the Kayman Sankar Group.

Outside of business, Sankar has been keenly involved in [[Sport in Guyana|Guyanese sport]], holding a pilots' licence and serving as a president of the Guyana Table Tennis Association and as a vice-president of the [[Guyana Cricket Board]].&lt;ref name="psc"/&gt; His first-class cricket career was brief, consisting only of a single match for Essequibo.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/24/24121/First-Class_Matches.html First-class matches played by Beni Sankar (1)] – CricketArchive. Retrieved 2 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The match was played against [[Berbice cricket team|Berbice]] at the [[Kayman Sankar Cricket Ground]], named for Sankar's father and located near his Hampton Court property. Sankar captained Essequibo, and, playing as a top-order batsman, scored two runs in the first innings and 20 runs in the second innings. He also bowled a single over of right-arm [[medium pace]] in Berbice's second innings, conceding four runs without taking a wicket.&lt;ref name="match"&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/40/40670.html Essequibo v Berbice], Jones Cup 1980/81 (Final) – CricketArchive.

He also founded the Cyprus Turkish Islamic Society, and was responsible for managing the construction of the [[Sunshine Mosque]].&lt;ref name="Hüssein 2007 loc=154"/&gt; Although the Turkish culture was a strong presence within his household, Dellal and his siblings found it difficult to speak the language, preferring instead to speak in [[English language|English]].

[[File:Cabin boy ou mousse 1799.jpg|thumb|Cabin boy, 1799]]
A '''cabin boy''' or '''ship's boy''' is a [[boy]] (in the sense of low-ranking young male employee, not always a minor in the juridical sense) who waits on the officers and passengers of a [[ship]],&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Oxford Dictionary'', Oxford University Press 1999, entry "Cabin boy"&lt;/ref&gt; especially running errands for the captain.
==Duties==
Cabin boys were usually 13–16 years old, but sometimes as young as 8,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.es/books?id=cVcAAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=%22cabin+boys%22+%22as+young+as%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MC1-9kyYDS&amp;sig=iTwIO4e4lfK8JqdQSpY3FdPes_g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwixmbGyxfDcAhUpLsAKHZ2uDFMQ6AEwDXoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cabin%20boys%22%20%22as%20young%20as%22&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and also helped the cook in the [[galley (kitchen)|ship's kitchen]] and carried buckets of food from the ship's kitchen to the [[forecastle]] where the ordinary seamen ate. They would have to run from one end of the ship to the other carrying messages and become familiar with the sails, lines and ropes and the use of each in all sorts of weather. They would have to scramble up the rigging into the yards whenever the sails had to be trimmed. They would occasionally stand watch like other crewmen or act as helmsman in good weather, holding the wheel to keep the ship steady on her course.

'''Carl Elsener Sr.''' (also known as Charles Elsener, born 6 July 1922 in Ibach, † 1 June 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/carl-elsener |title=Carl Elsener obituary |date=2 July 2013 |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Schwyz]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]].

== Life ==
Carl Elsener was the grandson of [[Karl Elsener (inventor)|Karl Elsener]] (1860-1918) and the son of Carl Elsener (1886-1950). Karl Elsener had opened a factory in [[Ibach SZ|Ibach]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10139841/Carl-Elsener.html |title=Carl Elsener |date=24 June 2013 |publisher=The Telegraph |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the production of knives and surgical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-swiss-army-knife-is-headed-for-the-u-s-army/ |title=The Swiss Army Knife is Headed For the U.S. Army |date=11 July 2017 |publisher=Warfare History |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which the knife factory [[Victorinox]] developed.

Carl Elsener led the company initially with his father and his brother Eduard Elsener (b. 1926). After the death of his father in 1950, he took over the management.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beautyinc.world/fashion-style/die-geschichte-von-victorinox |title=Mit Pioniergeist zur Weltmarke – Die Geschichte von Victorinox |publisher=Beautyinc |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss Army Knife]] is considered to be one of his works.&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/nachrichten/zentralschweiz/schwyz/Carl-Elsener-sen-gestorben;art96,265884 |title=Carl Elsener sen. gestorben |date=3 June 2013 |publisher=Luzerner Zeitung |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the leadership of Carl Elsener Sr., the Messerfabrik became the largest company in the canton of Schwyz. In 1938, Elsener joined the company, which at the time had employed 80 people. At the time of his death, there was well over a thousand employees. Elsener is described as a boss who was able to operate almost all the machines himself, who was traveling in the "[[Cardigan (sweater)|Lismerli]]" or in the [[Smock-frock|blue work coat]] and who cycled to the factory. He never owned a car. A few years before his death, he felt healthy enough to put in an 80-hour week.&lt;ref name="B" /&gt;

In October 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.moneyhouse.ch/de/company/victorinox-stiftung-20917758151 |title=Victorinox-Stiftung |publisher=Moneyhouse |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsner founded together with his brother Eduard Elsener and his son Carl Elsener Jr. as a successor solution, the Victorinox Foundation&lt;ref name="A" /&gt; to ensure the continued existence and further prosperity of the company. The Foundation holds 75 percent of the shares of Victorinox AG, another 15 percent belong to the non-profit Carl u. Elise Elsener-Gut Foundation. The Elsener family owns 10 percent of the shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.weltwoche.ch/ausgaben/2011_50/artikel/wir-haben-auf-unser-erbe-verzichtet-die-weltwoche-ausgabe-502011.html |title=Wir haben auf unser Erbe verzichtet |date=14 December 2011 |publisher=Die Weltwoche |access-date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Carl Elsener Sr. passed away, his son [[Carl Elsener Jr.]] (* 1958) has been managing the company since 2007.

'''Christchurch Central City''' is the geographical centre and the heart of [[Christchurch]], New Zealand. It is defined as the area within the four avenues (Bealey Avenue, Fitzgerald Avenue, Moorhouse Avenue and Deans Avenue&lt;ref&gt;[http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ResidentialDevelopment-OccupiedDwellings-docs.pdf Christchurch City Council definition]&lt;/ref&gt;) and thus includes the densely built up central city, some less dense surrounding areas of residential, educational and industrial usage, and green space including [[Hagley Park, Christchurch|Hagley Park]], the [[Christchurch Botanic Gardens]] and the [[Barbadoes Street Cemetery]].

It suffered heavy damage in the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]] and was devastated in the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. Following this second earthquake, the [[Central City Red Zone]] was set up and, with a gradually shrinking area, remained inaccessible except to authorised contractors until June 2013. However, proposals to relocate the city centre elsewhere, to avoid future damage, were considered both uneconomical (as much of the infrastructure was still mainly intact) and unnecessary, as the rebuilt city centre would be to modern building standards so as to be able to withstand similar quakes and liquefaction in the future.&lt;ref name=STAYS&gt;{{cite news|title=City centre stays despite quake|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10732989|accessdate=11 July 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=18 June 2011|first=Simon|last=Collins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
At the centre of the city is [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]], surrounding the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral, [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|Christ Church]]. The area around this square and within the four avenues of Christchurch is considered the central business district of the city.

The city centre is laid out in a grid pattern, interrupted only by the curvilinear alignment of the [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]], and the two diagonals High Street and Victoria Street. Christchurch has four pairs of one-way streets. The grid pattern within the outermost one-way streets is very regular, as this is the area that was laid out in the original survey. The surrounding area, i.e. the belt between the outer one-way streets and the avenues, was developed later in a progressive fashion and does not have the regularity of the core area.

Like most of the city, the centre is relatively flat.

== History ==

===European settlement===
[[File:Captain Joseph Thomas, 1840.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1840 portrait of Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]], the surveyor of [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]], [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] and Christchurch]]
The European settlement of Christchurch was undertaken by the [[Canterbury Association]], which was founded in London in 1848. That year, the Canterbury Association sent out Captain [[Joseph Thomas (surveyor)|Joseph Thomas]], accompanied by surveyors, to select and prepare a site for settlement. Thomas originally placed the principal town of the proposed settlement at the head of [[Lyttelton Harbour]], but when he realised there was insufficient flat land there to meet the Canterbury Association's requirements, he relocated Christchurch to where he had previously placed a town called 'Stratford' at a point on the Avon where those coming up the river first encountered slightly higher, drier ground.&lt;ref name="Context"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ChristchurchCityContextualHistoryOverviewFull-docs.pdf | title = Contextual Historical Overview for Christchurch City| type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Back then, the Avon River was navigable as far as 'The Bricks' just upstream of the Barbadoes Street bridge. The site is these days marked by a riverbank cairn. The site got its name when the Deans Brothers in the 1840s had shipped bricks for their [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]] homestead up the Avon River, which they unloaded in this location.
[[File:TheBricks.png|thumb|The Bricks on the southern bank of the Avon River. One of the huts is believed to have belonged to Joseph Thomas. The inserts show the First Four Ships that landed the colonists in 1850. Painted by John Dury in 1851.]]

===Survey layout===
[[File:Christchurch Survey 969.jpg|thumb|Plaque in [[Cathedral Square, Christchurch|Cathedral Square]] commemorating the Christchurch survey]]
Christchurch is one of a group of only four cities in the world that have been carefully planned following the same layout of a central city square, four complimenting city squares surrounding it and a parklands area that embrace the city centre. The first city built with this pattern was [[Philadelphia]], later came [[Oglethorpe Plan|Savannah]] and [[Adelaide]]. The fourth city using this pattern was Christchurch. As such Christchurch holds an important legacy and a strong platform for future development.

Thomas' plan for Christchurch (laid out by the surveyor [[Edward Jollie]] by March 1850) was the 'standard' rectangular grid of colonial settlement (adopted for ease of survey and to facilitate land sales). Thomas did not allow Jollie to include crescents to provide variety, but the Avon River ran eccentrically across the site. Two diagonal streets (High Street/Ferry Road leading to [[Ferrymead]], [[Heathcote Valley|Heathcote]] and [[Sumner, New Zealand|Sumner]] and Victoria Street/Papanui Road leading to the [[Papanui]] Bush) also broke the regularity of the grid. At the very centre of the city was a 'Square' (which is actually cross-shaped) intended as a grand centre for the city and the site of the proposed cathedral and grammar school. East and north-west of the Square were two more 'squares' ([[Latimer Square|Latimer]] and [[Cranmer Square]]s, which are actually rectangles) which were placed more or less regularly in relation to the diagonal line of the Avon running in a north-easterly direction across the city to the west and north of the central square.

The grid was laid out originally between Salisbury Street to the north and St Asaph Street to the south and between Barbadoes Street to the east and Rolleston Avenue/Park Terrace to the west. Between Salisbury, Barbadoes and St Asaph Streets and (respectively) the North, East and South Town Belts (these days called Bealey, Fitzgerald and Moorhouse Avenues) were 'town reserves', i.e. land with-held from immediate sale, which was sold off by the Provincial Government later in the 1850s to overcome cash flow problems. The streets of the original grid were mostly projected out to the Town Belts, but the street system is less systematic in the former 'town reserves'. The names chosen for the streets of the inner city almost all commemorate the English colonial origins of the settlement. The names chosen later for the town belts commemorate important personalities of early Christchurch.&lt;ref name="Context"/&gt; Jollie explains in his diary how the streets got their names:&lt;ref name="Jollie's diary"&gt;{{cite web|title=6. Christchurch: 1849–1851 |url= http://sites.google.com/site/marapito/jollie_06 |publisher=Canterbury Heritage |accessdate=6 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The names of the streets of the three towns I surveyed were taken from Bishoprics and the way it was done was this; as soon as I completed the map I took it to Thomas who putting on his gold spectacles and opening his&lt;!-- there's a noun missing here, and it's also missing in the original --&gt; would read out a Bishop's name to hear if it sounded well. If I agreed with him that it did, I put the name to one of the streets requiring baptism.

Lyttelton being the first born town got the best names for its streets, Sumner being next had the next best and Christchurch being the youngest had to be content with chiefly Irish and Colonial bishoprics as names for its streets. This accounts for, what to anyone not knowing the circumstances, appears strange, viz: that many of the best English Bishoprics are not represented while Irish and Colonial ones are. Sumner in fact died too late for the names there used to be again employed in Christchurch.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The original plan from 1850 shows the north-west corner of the 'town reserves' (surrounded by the Avon River, Fitzgerald and Bealey Avenues and Barbadoes Street, with an additional small rectangular area to the west of Barbadoes Street) as the cemetery for the settlement. Individual town sections were shown on the survey plan, the Black Map, and numbered by the surveyors in a logical order, in contrast to the rural sections surrounding Christchurch, which were numbered at the time of and in the order of their purchase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rural Sections Chosen |url= http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=LT18510301.2.13 |accessdate=16 March 2013 |newspaper=[[Lyttelton Times]] |volume=I |issue=8 |date=1 March 1851 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following streets were those laid out in the 1850 survey (listed east to west, then north to south, then diagonals). Where a street name is one of the original names as devised by surveyors Joseph Thomas and Edward Jollie, this is marked as such.

====Streets running north-south====
[[File:Black Map Christchurch 1850.jpg|thumb|Christchurch Black Map from March 1850]]
* Deans Avenue – the original name for this street was West Belt. In 1905, it got renamed to Rolleston Avenue, but was called West Belt again in 1906. Deans Avenue is named after the Deans family, who farmed at Riccarton from 1843 onwards.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-C-E.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names C to E|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=7, 8, 24, 107, 137, 173, 218|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harper Avenue – this street was formerly called Park Road and North Park Road. It was so named because it runs alongside Hagley Park. It was renamed Harper Avenue by city council resolution on 18 May 1931 in honour of the retiring chairman of the ''Christchurch Domains Board'' George Harper (1843–1937).&lt;ref name="CSN-F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-F-K.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names F to K|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=19, 25, 68, 85, 154, 194, 199, 303|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rolleston Avenue – this street formerly belonged to Antigua Street. The section between Cambridge Terrace and Armagh Street was renamed in honour of [[William Rolleston]] on 11 January 1903, about one month before his passing. This street was chosen because of his association with Canterbury College (now the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]], which adjoined Antigua Street and also because it was proposed to erect [[Rolleston Statue|his statue]] there.&lt;ref name="CSN-R"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-R-S.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names R to S|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=51, 85, 171|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Park Terrace – this street appears as Mill Road on an 1862 map. Park Terrace, named because it runs adjacent to Hagley Park, first appears in street directories in 1880.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-L-Q.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names L to Q|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=13, 32, 75, 92, 177, 180, 271, 286, 309|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cranmer Square (original street name) – Cranmer Square is adjacent to the square of the same name and is named after the martyred [[Oxford]] bishop [[Thomas Cranmer]].&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Montreal Street (original street name) – this street is named after the [[Anglican Diocese of Montreal]] in Canada. The surveyors ran out of English bishoprics to use as street names so moved on to other colonies.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Durham Street (original street name) – the street was named after the [[Diocese of Durham]]. On 21 October 1985 the council resolved for the two separate sections of Durham Street (between Gloucester Street and Cashel Street, which is part of Cambridge Terrace) to be renamed Durham Street North and South.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* [[Colombo Street]] (original street name) – this street is named after the colonial Anglican bishopric [[Colombo]] in what at the time was known as [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]].&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Manchester Street (original street name) – this street is named after [[William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester]], who was a member of the Canterbury association in 1848.&lt;!-- When you look at the source, it talks about 1858 and not 1848, i.e. after the Christchurch survey. This 1858 year is a typo and the library will fix this when they next upload the PDFs onto their webserver. Note that the Canterbury Association was wound up in 1853.--&gt;&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Latimer Square (original street name) – the street adjacent to Latimer Square is named after the martyred [[Oxford]] bishop [[Hugh Latimer]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Madras Street (original street name) – this street is named after the colonial Anglican bishopric of [[Chennai|Madras]] (now known as Chennai) in [[India]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Barbadoes Street (original street name) – this street is named after the Anglican colonial [[Diocese of Barbados]] in the [[Caribbean|West Indies]], now known as the Caribbean. The Christchurch spelling of Barbados with an additional 'e' is as per the original survey plan drawn by Edward Jollie.&lt;ref name="CSN-A"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-A-B.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names A to B|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=49, 118, 154|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fitzgerald Ave – the original names for this street were East Town Belt and East Belt. The street was renamed by council on 11 January 1904 in honour of [[James FitzGerald (New Zealand politician)|James FitzGerald]].&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
[[File:High, Manchester and Lichfield Streets in Christchurch, 8 May 1923.jpg|thumb|Intersection of High, Manchester and Lichfield Streets, Christchurch, 8 May 1923]]

====Streets running east-west====
* Bealey Avenue – the original name for this street was North Belt and North Town Belt. On 11 January 1904, it got renamed in honour of Canterbury's third [[Superintendent (politics)|Superintendent]] [[Samuel Bealey]], who owned land in this area.&lt;ref name="CSN-A"/&gt;
* Salisbury Street (original street name) – the street is named after the English [[Diocese of Salisbury]].&lt;ref name="CSN-R"/&gt;
* Peterborough Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Anglican Diocese of Peterborough]].&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* Kilmore Street (original street name) – the street is named after the Irish [[Diocese of Kilmore, Elphin and Ardagh|Diocese of Kilmore]].&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
* Chester Street (original street name) – the street is named after the English Anglican [[Diocese of Chester]]. It appears in 1883 street directories as Chester Street between East Town Belt and Colombo Street, and Chester Street West between Cambridge Terrace and Park Terrace. Chester Street West was renamed Cranmer Terrace for a short time in the 1950s because of the gap in Chester Street between Colombo Street and Cambridge Terrace. It reverted to its earlier name when the residents found that there was confusion with Cranmer Square.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Armagh Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Armagh (Church of Ireland)|Diocese of Armagh]].&lt;ref name="CSN-A"/&gt;
* Gloucester Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Gloucester]].&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
[[File:View looking west-south-west from the Cathedral Tower, Christchurch.jpg|left|thumb|Worcester Street and Cathedral Square from the ChristChurch Cathedral]]
* Worcester Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Anglican Diocese of Worcester]].&lt;ref name="CSN-T"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-T-Z.pdf|title=Christchurch Street Names T to Z|last=Harper|first=Margaret |publisher=[[Christchurch City Libraries]]|pages=58, 84, 170|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hereford Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of Hereford]].

* St Asaph Street (original street name) – the street is named after the [[Diocese of St Asaph]] in Wales.&lt;ref name="CSN-R"/&gt;
* Moorhouse Avenue – the original name for this street was South Belt and South Town Belt. On 11 January 1904, it got renamed in honour of Canterbury's second superintendent [[William Sefton Moorhouse]], who had championed the development of [[Lyttelton Line|Christchurch-Lyttelton railway]] and the [[Lyttelton rail tunnel]]. It was thus thought appropriate that the avenue adjacent to the railway be named after him.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;

====Other streets====
* Cambridge Terrace (original street name) – the street is named after the [[University of Cambridge]] in England. Waterloo Terrace was the name on the first plan of the road along the Avon River from Market Place (now Victoria Square) to past the Foresters' Hall, i.e. from near the Oxford-on-Avon and the [[Plunket Society]] round to near the Centennial Leisure Centre. Avonside Road was the section just south of the Barbadoes Street Cemetery, adjacent to the river bank and the river, across the river from the Avon Loop, east of Barbadoes Street and round to Fitzgerald Avenue.&lt;ref name="CSN-C"/&gt;
* Oxford Terrace (original street name) – the street is named after the [[University of Oxford]]. [[John Robert Godley]], considered to be the founder of Christchurch, had studied at [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], one of the colleges of the University of Oxford.&lt;ref name="CSN-L"/&gt;
* [[Victoria Street (Christchurch)|Victoria Street]] – this street was originally named Whately Road after [[Richard Whately]], who was a member of the Canterbury Association. It was renamed Victoria Street in 1877 after a petition signed by 61 residents was presented asking that the name be changed. The current street name commemorates [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref name="CSN-T"/&gt;
* High Street – this street was originally named Sumner Road, as it connected to the village of Sumner. At the time, Sumner was of great importance to Christchurch, as a road over the [[Port Hills]] was to be built connecting [[Lyttelton, New Zealand|Lyttelton]] with Sumner. The section north of St Asaph Street was renamed High Street.&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;
* Ferry Road – the CBD end of Ferry Road was originally called Sumner Road. The section south of St Asaph Street was renamed Lower High Street, and then Ferry Road.&lt;ref name="CSN-F"/&gt;

===Important Canterbury Association members===
The prime movers of the Canterbury Association were [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]] and John Robert Godley. Godley, with his family, went out to New Zealand in early 1850 to oversee the preparations for the settlement (surveying, roads, accommodation, etc.) undertaken by Captain Joseph Thomas' team. These preparations were advanced, but incomplete when the first ships of settlers arrived on 16 December 1850, having been halted by Godley shortly after his arrival in April due to the mounting debts of the Association. The ''[[Charlotte-Jane]]'' and ''[[Randolph (ship)|Randolph]]'' arrived in Lyttelton Harbour on the 16th, {{ship||Sir George Seymour|1844 ship|2}} on the 17th, and ''[[Cressy (ship)|Cressy]]'' on the 27th, having set sail from England in September 1850. The settlers on these [[First Four Ships]] were dubbed the ''Canterbury Pilgrims'' by the British press. A further 24 shiploads of Canterbury Association settlers, making a total of approximately 3,500, arrived over the next two and a half years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~nzbound/cbyassoc.htm Canterbury Association].&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010/11 earthquakes===
The central city was among the most heavily damaged areas of Christchurch following the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]]. Many building façades collapsed into the streets and authorities cordoned off large areas of the central city following the event. [[Manchester Courts]], the tallest commercial building in Christchurch when it was built in 1905–06 and a Category I heritage building suffered serious structural damage and was the first major building that was demolished, with the demolition finishing just days before the [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Demolition for historic high-rise"&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway |first=Glenn |title=Demolition for historic high-rise |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch/4205226/Demolition-for-historic-high-rise |accessdate=7 October 2010 |newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=7 October 2010 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly six months later on Tuesday 22 February 2011, [[2011 Christchurch earthquake|a second earthquake]] measuring magnitude 6.3 struck the city at 12:51&amp;nbsp;pm. It was located closer to the city,&lt;ref name="GeoNet6.3"&gt;{{Cite web

A large number of heritage buildings have been demolished since the earthquake, and most of the [[List of tallest buildings in Christchurch|city's high rise buildings]], including [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch|Hotel Grand Chancellor]], [[PricewaterhouseCoopers, Christchurch|PricewaterhouseCoopers]], [[Clarendon Tower]], and [[Implosion of Radio Network House|Radio Network House]] have been demolished.

Many churches have been demolished following the earthquakes, including [[Durham Street Methodist Church]], [[Oxford Terrace Baptist Church]], [[St Luke's Church, Christchurch]], [[St Paul's Church, Christchurch|St Paul's Church]], and [[St John the Baptist Church, Christchurch|St John the Baptist Church]]. Other churches are badly damaged and their fate is undecided, including the [[Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament, Christchurch|Cathedral of the Blessed Sacrament]] and the Anglican [[ChristChurch Cathedral, Christchurch|ChristChurch Cathedral]]. A replacement Anglican cathedral, the [[Cardboard Cathedral]], opened in August 2013 on the site of the former St John the Baptist Church.&lt;ref name=opening&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Ashleigh |title=Emotional moment for bishop at handover of new cathedral &lt;!-- title of online version is "Cardboard cathedral finally unveiled" --&gt; |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/8996908/Bishop-keyed-up-at-cardboard-cathedral-handover-ceremony |accessdate=3 August 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=3 August 2013 |page=A3 |location=[[Christchurch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Hagley Park 01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the central city in July 2012, with many of the earthquake-damaged [[List of tallest buildings in Christchurch|tall building]]s still standing]]

=== Overview ===
The Central City offered well over 450 unique retail businesses and over 130 cafes, restaurants, bars and clubs. It had the largest selection of fashion, food, café and entertainment in the [[South Island]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christchurchcity.org.nz/index.php Central City Business Association website&lt;/ref&gt;

The central city has a number of residential areas, including Inner City East, Inner City West, Avon Loop, Moa Neighbourhood &amp; Victoria. South of Tuam Street, commercial usage and some light industries are present. With over 6,000 full-time equivalent students, the [[Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology]] is the major education provider in the city centre.

Cathedral Square was a popular destination and hosts attractions such as the speakers' corner made famous by the [[Wizard of New Zealand]], Ian Brackenbury Channell, and evangelist [[Ray Comfort]].

A [[Christchurch tramway system|central city heritage tram]] system has been operated since 1995. In 2010, the system was extended to the south to form a figure of eight. The tram system does not fulfil a transport function and is aimed at the tourism market.

In 2010 the Christchurch City Council released "A City For People Action Plan", a program of work through to 2022 to improve public spaces within the central city to entice more inner city residents and visitors. A primary action is to reduce the impact of motorised private vehicles and increase the comfort of pedestrians and cyclists. The plan is based on a report prepared for the council by renowned Danish design firm Gehl Architects.

=== Precincts ===
The central city includes the pedestrianised Cashel and High Streets, known as [[City Mall, Christchurch|City Mall]]. At one end of the mall stands the [[Bridge of Remembrance]]; at the intersection of Cashel and High Streets is the old location of the amphitheatre known as the [[Hack Circle]]; and the portion of High Street up to the junction of Colombo and Hereford Streets forms the remaining part of the mall. The concept of a pedestrian mall originated in 1965 as part of a central city redevelopment study. The project was publicly notified in the 1968 District Scheme, and again in the 1979 review. In 1981, the Christchurch City Council, in collaboration with the Cashel and High Street Businessmen's Associations, adopted a design and authorised implementation. The streets were closed to traffic on 11 January 1982 and the Mall was opened by the former Mayor, Sir [[Hamish Hay]], on 7 August 1982.
[[File:New Zealand Christchurch Bridge of rememberence.jpg|thumb|The [[Bridge of Remembrance]] in Cashel Street]] On 17 December 2009, a revamped City Mall was opened by mayor [[Bob Parker (mayor)|Bob Parker]], incorporating the tourist tram through the mall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3173714/Christchurch-mall-revamp-injects-new-life |title=City Mall revamp opened |last=Conway |first=Glenn |date=18 December 2009 |publisher=The Press |page=A3 |accessdate=20 January 2010 |location=Christchurch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bridge of Remembrance was opened on Armistice Day, 11 November 1924 by the Governor-General, Admiral of the Fleet, Lord Jellicoe, who had previously laid the foundation stone on Anzac Day, 25 April 1923. The road through the bridge was removed and the short stretch between Oxford Terrace and Cambridge Terrace opened as a pedestrian precinct on 25 April 1977 (Anzac Day) by Captain [[Charles Upham]], i.e. this stretch became a pedestrian precinct some five years before the establishment of City Mall.&lt;ref&gt;http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Places/Memorials/BridgeofRemembrance/ Christchurch City Libraries information on the Bridge of Remembrance&lt;/ref&gt;

Another pedestrianised street is [[New Regent Street]], which has building facades in the Spanish Mission style. It became a pedestrian mall as part of the heritage tram loop in 1995. The street survived the earthquake with little damage, and is now functioning with several shops, and appearances by the Wizard of New Zealand.
[[File:Shops in New Regent Street.jpg|left|thumb|Spanish Mission building frontages in New Regent Street]]

Prior to the earthquakes, the [[Christchurch City Council]] was considering turning a section of Oxford Terrace (the section between Cashel Street and Hereford Street, then known as ''[[The Strip (Christchurch)|The Strip]]'') into a part-time pedestrian mall (nightly from 11&amp;nbsp;pm to 5&amp;nbsp;am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oxford Terrace part-time pedestrian mall proposal|url= http://www1.ccc.govt.nz/council/agendas/2009/july/hagleyferrymead15th/hagleyferrymeadcommunityboardagenda15july2009.pdf |publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]] |accessdate=5 July 2013 |format=PDF |date=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since around 2005, two precincts have developed in small central city lanes, known as ''Poplar Lane'' and ''South of Lichfield'' or ''SOL Square''. A large number of bars are accommodated in these two areas, with a very active night life. These areas complement ''The Strip'', a part of Oxford Terrace that started to support outdoor dining during the day and night time entertainment in the 1990s.

The Cultural Precinct [http://www.culturalprecinct.co.nz/] provides a backdrop to a vibrant scene of ever-changing arts, cultural, and heritage attractions within an area of less than one square kilometre. The [[Christchurch Arts Centre|Arts Centre]], the [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]], the [[Christchurch Art Gallery]] and the [[Centre of Contemporary Art]] (CoCA) are located in the Cultural Precinct. The majority of the activities are free.

=== Heritage buildings ===
The central city has a large number of registered heritage buildings that are either listed with [[Heritage New Zealand]] or are noted in the Christchurch City Plan. A large number of these buildings have been significantly damaged by the recent earthquakes. Some heritage buildings collapsed during the February earthquake (e.g. the Stone Chamber of the [[Canterbury Provincial Council Buildings]]&lt;ref name="Press 26 Feb"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachdeva |first=Sam |title=People first, buildings take a back seat |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=26 February 2011 |author2=Moore, Christopher |location=Christchurch |page=A22}}&lt;/ref&gt;), many have been demolished already (e.g. [[St Elmo Courts]],&lt;ref name="Press demo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Giles|title=Heritage building too damaged to save |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/4789954/Heritage-building-too-damaged-to-save |accessdate=21 March 2011 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=21 March 2011 |author2=Keith Lynch |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Press Building, Christchurch|The Press Building]]&lt;ref name="demolition decision"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynch|first=Keith|title=More than 128 Christchurch buildings face demolition |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/4838607/More-than-128-Christchurch-buildings-face-demolition |accessdate=2 April 2011|newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[St Luke's Church, Christchurch|St Luke's Church]]&lt;ref name="Press St Luke's"&gt;{{cite news|title=St Luke's is being demolished |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/5244018/St-Lukes-is-being-demolished |accessdate=6 June 2012|newspaper=[[The Press]]|date=6 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and for many heritage buildings, the fate is as yet unclear (e.g. the [[Peterborough Centre]].&lt;ref name="earthquake repairs"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heather|first=Ben|title=Owners vow to save historic edifice|url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/christchurch-earthquake-2011/5119007/Owners-vow-to-save-historic-edifice |accessdate=18 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;) [[McLean's Mansion]] in Manchester Street, a 53-room dwelling built in 1900 for 78-year-old bachelor [[Allan McLean (philanthropist)|Allan McLean]], is currently threatened with demolition.&lt;ref name="Architectural Heritage"&gt;{{cite web |title=McLeans Mansion |url= http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Publications/ChristchurchCityCouncil/ArchitecturalHeritage/McLeansMansion/McLeansMansion.pdf |publisher=[[Christchurch City Council]] Town Planning Division |accessdate=18 July 2013 |location=[[Christchurch]] |format=PDF |date=June 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Editorial: McLean's Mansion should be saved |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/opinion/editorials/8921485/Editorial-McLeans-Mansion-should-be-saved |accessdate=18 July 2013 |newspaper=[[The Press]] |date=16 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population ===
[[File:Central City Population.jpg|thumb|Comparing extrapolated historic growth in resident population with required growth to reach 30,000 residents by 2026.]]
The central city prior to the 2010-2011 earthquakes had an increasing residential population. The last four [[New Zealand census]]es had the usual resident population on 30 June recorded as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Statistics NZ |url=http://www.stats.govt.nz/StatsMaps/Home/People%20and%20households/2013-census-population-dwelling-map.aspx |publisher=Stats NZ |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christchurch City Council alongside Otakaro Limited is trying to revitalise the central city. The Council aspires to have 30,000 residents living within the Four Avenues by 2026.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/ThePress20080816-ourchristchurch.pdf Central city population mentioned in CCC newsletter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greaterchristchurch.org.nz/Strategy/UDSSummary2008.pdf Central city population mentioned in Urban Development Strategy document&lt;/ref&gt; When the historic census population (for 1996, 2001 and 2006) is plotted and extrapolated to 2026, and compared to the required growth to reach a projected population of 30,000 residents by 2026, it becomes clear that this is an ambitious goal. Entire city blocks have been earmarked for residential development,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=East Frame Pūtahi Whakaterāwhiti |url=https://www.otakaroltd.co.nz/anchor-projects/the-east-frame/ |publisher=Otakaro Limited |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as private developments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fletchers to build 191 inner-city homes for Christchurch |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/your-property/68403229/fletchers-to-build-191-innercity-homes-for-christchurch |publisher=Stuff |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming toward this goal.

=== Economy ===
The central city is an important employment area supporting 26,000 [[full-time equivalent]] (FTE) employees, and with much of the floor area taken up by office space. One of the biggest employers is Christchurch City Council with 800 FTE at the civic offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/council/projects/cbdproject/docs/demographicandemploymentdata.pdf Employment data&lt;/ref&gt;

The southern part of the central city has traditionally been home to manufacturing, but there has been a decline in this area, with many companies either moving to commercial subdivisions, closing, or relocating overseas.

=== Education ===
Many education providers are located in the city centre. Christchurch Polytechnic with 6000 students is the largest of these. There are numerous language schools, providing a platform for an important market of attracting mainly Asian students to the city.

There are several schools in the central city.
[[File:Christ's College entrance.jpg|thumb|Main entrance of Christ's College]]
* [[Christ's College, Christchurch|Christ's College]] is an independent, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], secondary, [[Day school|day]] and [[boarding school]] for boys.

* [[Catholic Cathedral College]] is an integrated co-educational secondary school. It was founded in 1987 from the amalgamation of two schools: Sacred Heart College for girls, and Xavier College for boys.

=== Green space ===
[[File:HagleyPark02 gobeirne.jpg|left|thumb|Late afternoon in Hagley Park]]
Hagley Park is, at 165 ha, the largest [[urban open space]] in Christchurch. The park was created in 1855 by the Provincial Government.&lt;ref&gt;http://resources.ccc.govt.nz/files/HagleyParkMgtPlan2007_ALL_LR-popularparks.pdf Hagley Park Management Plan&lt;/ref&gt; According to the government's decree at that time, Hagley Park is "reserved forever as a public park, and shall be open for the recreation and enjoyment of the public." Hagley Park is characterised by its trees and broad open spaces. Hagley Park was named after the country estate of [[George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton|Lord Lyttelton]], who became chairman of the Canterbury Association in March 1850.&lt;ref&gt;http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nzbound/cby.htm Information on Lord Lyttelton&lt;/ref&gt;

The Christchurch Botanic Gardens are botanical gardens founded in 1863,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/parkswalkways/christchurchbotanicgardens/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091019082224/http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/parkswalkways/christchurchbotanicgardens/index.aspx |archivedate=19 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }} The Christchurch Botanic Gardens&lt;/ref&gt; when on 9 July an [[English oak]] was planted to commemorate the solemnisation of marriage between [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince Albert]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess Alexandra]] of [[Denmark]]. The Gardens cover an area of 21 hectares,&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.ccc.govt.nz/webapps/parksaz/P44.asp Council website&lt;/ref&gt; and lie adjacent to the loop of the Avon River next to Hagley Park.

The Barbadoes Street Cemetery is a large green space in the north-east of the central city. It is the city’s oldest cemetery and opened in 1851. It is the final resting place of many of Christchurch’s early leading citizens. The cemetery itself is divided by Barbadoes Street separating the Anglican (Church of England) section, on the eastern side, from the Roman Catholic and Dissenters (others) section on the west.&lt;ref&gt;http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/Cemeteries/Barbadoes/ Library information on the Barbadoes Street Cemetery&lt;/ref&gt; The cemetery was initially envisaged to be much larger, but with the establishment of suburbs and villages with their own cemeteries, it became clear that less land was needed. The cemetery was subdivided in 1896 and Churchill Street was formed, with the eastern part of the original cemetery thus becoming a residential area.&lt;ref&gt;http://christchurchcitylibraries.com/Heritage/PlaceNames/ChristchurchStreetNames-C-E.pdf Information on Churchill Street&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transport ==
[[File:01 Christchurch 178 Brill car.jpg|thumb|right|A Christchurch tram]]
Due to the grid pattern of the roads, the central city has a high number of traffic signals. Four pairs of one-way streets are located only a few hundred metres away from Cathedral Square, making it easy to drive through the city centre. The avenues in the north, east and south surrounding the central city are generally six-lane median divided. Fitzgerald and Bealey Avenues stand out due to the trees in those central medians.

With about 30,000 car parks (both public and private), the central city has one of the highest ratios of car parking and employment of the [[OECD]] countries. As both driving and parking is relatively easy, Christchurch has a high car ownership rate.

Cycling is reasonably popular in central Christchurch, with the second highest rate of commuter cycling in New Zealand (after Nelson). Free covered bike lock-ups are located in six City Council-run car parking buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/gettingaround/cycling/cyclingguide.aspx Information on covered bicycle parking; accessed 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public transport in Christchurch]] is mainly based on buses and supported by taxis. There is a functioning [http://www.tram.co.nz/ tram service] in Christchurch, but as a tourist attraction, its loop is restricted to a circuit of the central city and it does not fulfil a public transport function.

The city council provided the current ''Bus Exchange'' between Lichfield and Cashel Streets in November 2000. A new ''Transport Interchange'' is planned for the block surrounded by Lichfield, Colombo, Tuam and Durham Streets, as the existing Bus Exchange is nearing capacity.

Long distance buses depart mostly from Worcester Street near Cathedral Square. All local buses that go through the central city use the ''Bus Exchange''. It is envisaged that long distance and local services will all use the ''Transport Interchange''. In addition to normal bus services, the central city has a [[zero-fare]] [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus service, the ''Shuttle''.

The [[Christchurch railway station (New Zealand)|railway station]] used to be located on the southern boundary of the central city on Moorhouse Avenue, but has been relocated to the suburb of [[Riccarton, New Zealand|Riccarton]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14481">'''Codentify''' is the name of a product serialization system developed and patented by [[Philip Morris International]] (PMI) for tobacco product authenticity verification and supply chain control. In the production process, each cigarette package is marked with a unique visible code (also called “Codentify”), that allows authenticating the code against a central server.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.com/eng/documents/Codentify_E_Brochure_English.pdf|title=Codentify E Brochure|last=|first=|date=|website=Pmi.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joossens|first=Luk|last2=Gilmore|first2=Anna B.|date=2013-03-12|title=The transnational tobacco companies’ strategy to promote Codentify, their inadequate tracking and tracing standard|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/early/2013/03/11/tobaccocontrol-2012-050796|journal=Tobacco Control|language=en|pages=tobaccocontrol–2012-050796|doi=10.1136/tobaccocontrol-2012-050796|issn=1468-3318|pmc=3897562|pmid=23481904|volume=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, PMI licensed the system to its three main competitors, namely [[British American Tobacco]] (BAT), Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG), and [[Japan Tobacco International]] (JTI), and the four companies together formed the Digital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) which works to promote the system in order to replace governmental revenue stamps.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Codentify is branded by its inventors as a “track &amp; trace and product authentication technology”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== History ==
In July 2004, Phillip Morris International and the [[European Union]] had settled a 12 year long legal dispute concerning cigarette smuggling charges. PMI agreed to pay 1.25 Billion USD to the EU budget and its member states. In addition, PMI was legally obligated to mark its products with trackable serial codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2004/jul/09/smoking.europeanunion|title=Philip Morris reaches $1.25bn EU agreement|last=Tran|first=Mark|date=2004-07-09|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-04-882_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - European Commission and Philip Morris International sign 12-year Agreement to combat contraband and counterfeit cigarettes|website=europa.eu|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fctc.org/publications/bulletins/doc_view/451-legal-analysis-of-eu-agreements-with-multinational-tobacco-companies |title=Legal analysis of the agreements between the European Union, Member States, and multinational tobacco companies |author=Madeleine Heyward LL.M. (New York) |website=Fctc.org |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Agreements were subsequently signed with the other three major tobacco companies.

PMI's daughter company, Philip Morris Products S.A. created and patented the Codentify system in 2005.

In late 2010, PMI licensed Codentify to its main competitors BAT, JTI, and ITG free of charge.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Does the tobacco industry have a tracking and tracing system that governments can use?|url=http://www.fctc.org/images/stories/Codentify_final_220515.pdf|journal=WORLD NO TOBACCO DAY 2015|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four companies, which together account for 71% of global cigarette sales (excluding China), agreed to use the PMI-developed system on all of their products to ensure “the adoption of a single industry standard, based on Codentify.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hill M|title=Digital Tax Verification (DTV) Codentify, The industry Standard, October 2010 and Philip Morris International, Codentify, Brochure, 2012|url=http://www.pmi.com/eng/documents/Codentify_E_Brochure_English.pdf|format=PDF|website=Pmi.com|accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) immediately voiced concerns that “Codentify should never be used for tracking and tracing purposes as tracking and tracing provisions should be implemented under the strict control and management of governments.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fctc.org/publications/bulletins/doc_view/493-bulletin-issue-113|title=Framework Convention Alliance Bulletin|last=|first=|date=|website=Fctc.org|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the four companies formed the Digital Coding and Tracking Association (DCTA) to promote international standards and digital technologies to help governments fight smuggling, counterfeiting and tax evasion. The association was officially launched in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/association-launched-to-fight-illicit-trade-in-excisable-goods-2013-05-22|title=Association launched to fight illicit trade in excisable goods|newspaper=MarketWatch|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the DCTA, around 12% of the global cigarette market is illicit, depriving national governments of more than US$40 billion a year in lost tax revenues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aitcentral.com/content/tobacco-where-volume-counts-0|title=Tobacco: where volume counts|last=|first=|date=|website=AIT Central: fighting illicit trade|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some say this is a serious underestimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash.org.uk/files/documents/ASH_961.pdf|title=Illicit Tobacco: What is the Tobacco Industry Trying to Do?|last=|first=|date=|website=Ash.org.uk|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opus.bath.ac.uk/38005/|title=Towards a greater understanding of the illicit tobacco trade in Europe: A review of the PMI funded ‘Project Star’ report|last=|first=|date=|website=Opus.bath.ac.uk|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreements between the EU and the four major tobacco companies  aim to stem the illicit trade of cigarettes, but are seen by academics in the field as a wholly inadequate deterrent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/25/3/254 |title=Assessment of the European Union's illicit trade agreements with the four major Transnational Tobacco Companies &amp;#124; Tobacco Control |website=Tobaccocontrol.bmj.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/investigations/eu-revenue/cigarette_smuggling_en |title=Tobacco smuggling - European Commission |website=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EU has since not renewed this deal after MEPs complained that it was ineffective and inappropriate that governments and tobacco companies have such a deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/1724b620-42b9-11e6-b22f-79eb4891c97d.html#axzz4EpsiGmrl |title=EU to end anti-tobacco smuggling deal with Philip Morris |website=Ft.com |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inexto ==
In June 2016 the DCTA announced that it transferred Codentify to Inexto, an affiliate of the French Group Impala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcta-global.com/docs/DCTA_Press%20Release_1June2016.pdf |format=PDF |title=DCTA technology ownership transferred to Inexto, an affiliate of Impala Group |website=Dcta-global.com |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was criticized by leading industry watchdogs such as the FCTC and academics such as Anna Gilmore, who is the director of the tobacco control research group at the University of Bath. She said that “Inexto could not be considered sufficiently independent from the tobacco industry". Martyn Day, Scottish National Party Member of Parliament, says while Codentify was sold "the new owner is merely a front company and that the system is still under the effective control of the tobacco firms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2016-12-20/debates/FF51202E-34FA-48C7-B002-28DB6AF473AA/ChristmasAdjournment#contribution-2494C922-BC37-458E-A0E8-246FC3551B09|title=Christmas Adjournment - Hansard Online|website=hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics such as Luk Joossens, who is the advocacy officer of the Association of European Cancer Leagues, said the sale was “predictable” and that tobacco companies will now “pretend” that Codentify is no longer part of the tobacco industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saturday 4th Mar 2017 |url=https://euobserver.com/economic/133899 |title=Big Tobacco suspected of dodging EU anti-smuggling rules |website=Euobserver.com |date=2016-06-01 |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMI have rebutted that “Inexto is fully independent from the tobacco industry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tobacco.cleartheair.org.hk/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Pharmalutions-Joerss-Codentify-upd.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pharmalutions Pte Ltd |website=Tobacco.cleartheair.org.hk |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A communiqué by Argentine lawyer Alejandro Sánchez Kalbermatten to the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) explained the relationship between PMI, Inexto and Impala in a diagram.

== Technology ==
The Codentify system is based on a machine-created, unique, human-readable 12-digit alphanumeric code that is printed directly onto every individual product during the manufacturing process.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iticnet.org/file/document/watch/3616|title=Digital Tax Verification|last=|first=|date=|website=Iticnet.org|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Factory level encryption keys are stored on a server and allows for the production of a pre-defined number of Codentify codes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The code created by the system is described as random, offering 34&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; possible combinations. A range of data can be encrypted into the code such as date and time of manufacture, the machine of manufacture, brand, variant, pack size, pack type, destination market, and price.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

This system presents limitations as it only allows for the verification of the code itself, not of the product the code is printed on and is potentially open to copying.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A European Commission Assessment Report into Tracking and Tracing notes in section 5.1.2 that in addition to the Codentify code being easily copied, it also fails to link the cigarette packets to the master cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/health/tobacco/do,cs/2015_tpd_tracking_tracing_frep_en.pdf|title=Analysis and Feasibility Assessment Regarding EU systems for Tracking and Tracing of Tobacco Products and for Security Features|last=|first=|date=|website=Ec.europa.eu|publisher=|access-date=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Codentify has been the subject of harsh criticism as a tobacco industry promoted system which is aimed at undermining public health efforts and not capable of curbing the illicit trade of cigarettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Condentify: an industry attempt to control illicit trade|url=https://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/sites/default/files/resources/codentify-flyer.pdf|journal=Corporate Accountability International|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This criticism has come from academics and pro-health groups&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  as well as government agencies, including the [[World Health Organization|WHO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/fctc/mediacentre/news/2016/remarks-head-fctc-high-level-conference-brussels/en/|title=Dr Vera Luiza da Costa e Silva, head of the Convention Secretariat, sends her remarks to the High Level Conference: Combating tobacco industry tactics: state of play and a way forward, European Parliament, Brussels, 2 March 2016|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO [[WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control|FCTC Protocol]] on the Elimination of the Illicit Trade in Tobacco products states in article 8, section 12 that tobacco tracking and regulation “shall not be performed by or delegated to the tobacco industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/80873/1/9789241505246_eng.pdf |format=PDF |title=Protocol to Eliminate Illicit Trade in Tobacco Products |website=Apps.who.int |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whyitisbad.wordpress.com/2016/02/29/world-health-organization-is-the-solution-for-codentify/|title=World Health Organization is the Solution for Codentify|last=whyitsbad|date=2016-02-29|website=Why It's Bad|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the tobacco industry say Codentify is simply not good enough, “because it focuses too much on production and does not store product codes or track them.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-tobacco-tracking-insight-idUSKBN0ET0I720140618|title=Big Tobacco squares up as EU rules aim to track every cigarette|last=Geller|first=Martinne|newspaper=Reuters UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy criticism has also been launched at the factory-level keys the system uses to provide unique verification codes for the product. Since these secret keys are stored on company and government servers, abuse of privileges on this level would allow criminals to generate additional codes, which would appear to be genuine to the system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tobaccofact.org/blog/major-flaws-discovered-in-the-codentify-track-and-trace-system|title=Major Flaws Discovered in the Codentify Track and Trace System|website=Tobacco Industry facts|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Why It Is Bad - Tobacco Track and Trace|title=Codentify - Interview with a Tobacco Industry Insider|date=2015-05-28|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQ7gZ_D_WMM|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decentralized nature of the system also allows for a variety of other counterfeiting efforts critics say, such as “code recycling”, using codes of products rejected in quality control, “code cloning”, printing the same code on multiple products, and “code migration”, reprinting codes used in one country elsewhere, allowing the reuse of genuine codes multiple times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Action on Smoking and Health]] (ASH) described the system as a black box created by the tobacco industry that uses unsecured equipment that is vulnerable to code recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fctc.org/images/stories/Codentify_final_220515.pdf |format=PDF |title=Does the tobacco industry have a tracking and tracing system that governments can use? |website=Fctc.org |accessdate=2017-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, you receive a defective product and call the manufacturer, they in turn send you a replacement unit after collecting a purchase order, credit card or collateral billing number from you to charge the cost of the unit to in the event that you do not return the original unit.

'''David Ramsay Hay''' {{Post-nominals|post-noms=[[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]]}} (March 1798, Edinburgh – 10 September 1866) was a Scottish artist, [[interior decorator]] and [[colour theorist]].

==Life==
[[File:Abbotsford04.jpg|thumb|Entrance Hall at Abbotsford, decorated by David Ramsay Hay, 1824]]
[[File:The grave of David Ramsay Hay, Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The grave of David Ramsay Hay, Warriston Cemetery, Edinburgh]]
David Ramsay Hay was the son of Rebekah or Rebecca Carmichael, a published poet and friend of [[Robert Burns]].&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, Roger H., ed., ''Eighteenth Century Women Poets: an Anthology'', OUP (1990) 445.&lt;/ref&gt; They lived at the foot of Monteith's Close off the [[Royal Mile]] in [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1798&lt;/ref&gt; After her husband died prematurely and penniless, David was educated at the expense of her brother, David Ramsay, a banker and owner of the ''Edinburgh Evening Courant''&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110810105045960&lt;/ref&gt; then apprenticed as a reading-boy in Ramsay's printing office in [[Edinburgh]]. Instead though (around 1813), Hay moved to join Gavin Beugo (son of [[John Beugo]])&lt;ref&gt;http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb237-coll-329&lt;/ref&gt; a decorative artist, based on West Register Street in [[New Town, Edinburgh|Edinburgh's New Town]].&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1812&lt;/ref&gt; His fellow-apprentice was his friend, the topographical artist [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]]. In April 1820 he commenced work at [[Abbotsford House|Abbotsford]] for [[Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;Hay, ''Harmonious Colouring'', 6th edition (1847), 182.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 he decorated [[Holyroodhouse]] for [[Queen Victoria]]. In the 1920s, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] had these decorative schemes painted over, but watercolours commissioned by Victoria in 1863 give some idea of their appearance.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, Theresa-May, ''Royal Residences of the Victorian Era'', The Royal Collection (1991), 53-59&lt;/ref&gt;

Hay was an advocate of imitative finishes such as graining and marbling, and textured paints to imitate brocade fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, Ian C., ''Interior House Painting Colours &amp; Technology, 1615-1840'', Yale (1996), 141.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1828, he developed his theory of colour harmony over six successive editions of his book, ''The Laws of Harmonious Colouring Adapted to Interior Decorations''.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, Ian C., ''Architectural Colour in British Interiors, 1615-1840'', Yale (1996), 191&lt;/ref&gt; Hay wrote about his experience decorating Abbotsford for Walter Scott in the sixth edition of his ''Harmonious Colouring.''&lt;ref&gt;''Harmonious Colouring'', 6th edition (1847), pp.181-97, see external links.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years he had exclusive premises at 90 George Street in the centre of Edinburgh's New Town.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1866-67&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Edinburgh]] on 10 September 1866.&lt;ref&gt;http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb237-coll-329&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried in [[Warriston Cemetery]] in the north of the city. The substantial tombstone stands to the south-west of the sealed eastern entrance. The monument is vandalised and the original bronze bas-relief sculpture of his profile has been stolen.

{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}
'''Evidence-based policy''' ('''EBP''') is a term often applied in multiple fields of [[public policy]] to refer to situations whereby policy decisions are informed by rigorously established objective [[evidence]].  Underlying many of the calls for 'evidence based policy' is often a (stated or unstated) concern with fidelity to scientific good practice, reflecting the belief that social goals are best served when [[scientific evidence]] is used rigorously and comprehensively to inform decisions, rather than in a piecemeal, manipulated, or cherry-picked manner. 

Conceptually the term has been seen as an extension of the [[Scientific method]] or [[evidence-based medicine]] to all areas of public policy. 

Some have promoted particular types of evidence as 'best' for policy makers to consider, including scientifically rigorous evaluation studies such as [[randomized controlled trial]]s to identify programs and practices capable of improving policy-relevant outcomes. However, some areas of policy-relevant knowledge are not well served by quantitative research, leading to debate about the methods and instruments that are considered critical for the collection of relevant evidence. For instance, policies that are concerned with human rights, public acceptability, or social justice may require other evidence than what randomized trials provide, or may require moral philosophical reasoning in addition to considerations of evidence of intervention effect (which randomised trials are principally designed to provide &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jech.57.7.527 |pmid=12821702 |pmc=1732497 |title=Evidence, hierarchies, and typologies: Horses for courses |journal=Journal of Epidemiology &amp; Community Health |volume=57 |issue=7 |pages=527–9 |year=2003 |last1=Petticrew |first1=M }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Good data, analytical skills and political support to the use of scientific information, as such, are typically seen as the important elements of an evidence-based approach.&lt;ref&gt;Head, Brian. (2009). [http://www.pc.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/96208/03-chapter2.pdf Evidence-based policy: principles and requirements]. [[University of Queensland]]. Retrieved 4 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although evidence-based policy can be traced as far back as the fourteenth century, it was more recently popularized by the [[Blair Government]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"&gt;Banks, Gary (2009). [http://www.pc.gov.au/speeches/cs20090204 Evidence-based policy making: What is it? How do we get it?]. Australian Government, [[Productivity Commission]]. Retrieved 4 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Blair Government said they wanted to end the ideological led-based decision making for policy making.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"/&gt; For example, a UK Government white paper published in 1999 (''"Modernising Government"'') noted that Government must "produce policies that really deal with problems, that are forward-looking and shaped by evidence rather than a response to short-term pressures; that tackle causes not symptoms".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Evidence-based policy is associated with [[AFM Smith|Adrian Smith]] because in his 1996 presidential address to the [[Royal Statistical Society]], Smith questioned the current process of policy making and urged for a more “evidence-based approach” commenting that it has “valuable lessons to offer”.&lt;ref&gt;Boaz, Ashby, Young (2002). [http://www.kcl.ac.uk/content/1/c6/03/45/85/wp2.pdf Systematic Reviews: What have they got to offer evidence based policy and practice?] ESRC UK Centre for Evidence Based Policy and Practice. Retrieved 7th May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Some policy scholars now avoid using the term 'evidence based' policy, using others such as 'evidence informed'. This language shift allows continued thinking about the underlying desire to ''improve'' evidence use in terms of its rigor or quality, while avoiding some of the key limitations or reductionist ideas at times seen with the 'evidence based' language. Still, the language of 'evidence based' policy is widely used and, as such, can be interpreted to reflect a desire for evidence to be used well or appropriately in one way or another - such as by ensuring systematic consideration of rigorous and high quality policy relevant evidence, or by avoiding biased and erroneous applications of evidence for political ends.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parkhurst|first1=Justin|title=The Politics of Evidence: from Evidence Based Policy to the Good Governance of Evidence|date=2017|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9781138939400|url=http://www.tandfebooks.com/action/showBook?doi=10.4324/9781315675008|doi=10.4324/9781315675008}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of evidence-based policy==

The earliest form of evidence-based policy was tariff-making in Australia which was required under legislation to be educated by the public report issued by the Tariff Board. These reports were initially only reporting on the impacts but changed to also report on the effects of industries and the economy.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"/&gt;

Many scholars see the term "evidence-based policy" as evolving from "evidence-based medicine", in which research findings are used as the support for clinical decisions  and evidence is gathered by randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which is comparing a treatment group with a placebo group to measure results.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"&gt;Marston &amp; Watts. [http://arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au/journal/v3/n3/marston_watts.pdf Tampering with the Evidence: A Critical Appraisal of Evidence-Based Policy-Making]. RMIT University. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the Cochrane Collaboration was established in the UK, and works to keep all RCTs up-to-date and provides "Cochrane reviews" which provides primary research in human health and health policy.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cochrane.org/ The Cochrane Collaboration] Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; There was then an increase in research and policy activists pushing for more evidence-based policy-making which led to the formation of the sister organization to Cochrane Collaboration, the [[Campbell Collaboration]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campbellcollaboration.org/ The Campbell Collaboration] Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Campbell Collaboration conducts reviews on the best evidence that analyzes the effects of social and educational policies and practices.

The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) became involved in the push for more evidence-based policy making with its 1.3 million pound grant to the Evidence Network in 1999. The Evidence Network is a center for evidence-based policy and practice and is similar to both the Campbell and Cochrane Collaboration.&lt;ref name="arpa.econ.usyd.edu.au"/&gt;

More recently the [http://www.alliance4usefulevidence.org Alliance for Useful Evidence] has been established, with funding from ESRC, Big Lottery and Nesta, to champion the use of evidence in social policy and practice. The Alliance is a UK-wide network that promotes the use of high quality evidence to inform decisions on strategy, policy and practice through advocacy, publishing research, sharing ideas and advice, and holding events and training.

Recently questions have been raised about the conflicts-of-interest inherent to evidence-based decision-making used in public policy development.  In a study of vocational education in prisons operated by the California Department of Corrections, Andrew J. Dick, William Rich, and Tony Waters found that political considerations inevitably intruded into “evidence-based decisions” which were ostensibly technocratic in nature.  They point out that this is particularly where evidence is paid for by policy makers who have a vested interest in having past political judgments confirmed, evidence based research is likely to be corrupted.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 11-40 and 281-306 in "Prison Vocational Education and Policy in the United States" by Andrew J. Dick, William RIch, and Tony Waters. New York: Palgrave Macmillan 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The methodology of evidence-based policy==

There are many methodologies for evidence-based policy but they all share the following characteristics:
*Tests a theory as to why the policy will be effective and what the impacts of the policy will be if it is successful
*Includes a counterfactual: what would have occurred if the policy had not been implemented
*Incorporates some measurement of the impact
*Examines both direct and indirect effects that occur because of the policy
*Separates the uncertainties and controls for other influences outside of the policy that may have an effect on the outcome
*Should be able to be tested and  replicated by a third party

The form of methodology used with evidence-based policy fit under the category of a cost-benefit framework and are created to estimate a net payoff if the policy was to be implemented. Because there is a difficulty in quantifying some effects and outcomes of the policy, it is mostly focused broadly on whether or not benefits will outweigh costs, instead of using specific values.&lt;ref name="pc.gov.au"/&gt;

==Critiques of evidence-based policy==

Several critiques have emerged. Paul Cairney, professor of politics and public policy at the [[University of Stirling]] in Scotland, argues&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/946724638|title=The politics of evidence-based policy making|last=1973-|first=Cairney, Paul,|isbn=9781137517814|location=New York|oclc=946724638}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supporters of the idea underestimate the complexity of policy-making and misconstrue the way that policy decisions are usually made. Moreover, evidence has emerged&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/government-numbers-data-damaging-public-services/|title=Government by numbers: how data is damaging our public services {{!}} Apolitical|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; of front-line public servants, like hospital managers, making decisions that actually worsen patients' care in order to hit pre-ordained targets. This argument was put forward by Professor Jerry Muller of the [[Catholic University of America]] in a book called The Tyranny of Metrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1005121833|title=The tyranny of metrics|last=1954-|first=Muller, Jerry Z.,|isbn=9780691174952|location=Princeton|oclc=1005121833}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of critiques, including the fact that policies shown to be successful in one place often fail in others, despite reaching a gold standard of evidence, has been compiled by the policy platform Apolitical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apolitical.co/solution_article/evidence-based-policymaking-is-there-room-for-science-in-politics/|title=Evidence-based policymaking: is there room for science in politics? {{!}} Apolitical|work=Apolitical|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Evidence-based development policy==
The [[Overseas Development Institute]] has pioneered RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach (ROMA) over the past five years as a means to help aid donors and partners better transform research into policy initiatives.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;Young, John and Mendizabal, Enrique  (2009) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs: How to develop engagement strategies for evidence-based policy-making] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806061940/http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma |date=6 August 2010 }} London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is supported by other research within the development community. For instance, in a literature review focused on development, an integrated, participatory, structured and empowering approach to using evidence and data in decision-making to inform development decisions was tied to improved results. &lt;ref&gt;[https://usaidlearninglab.org//lab-notes/cracking-evidence-conundrum-four-ideas-get-people-use-evidence "Cracking the Evidence Conundrum: Four Ideas to Get People to Use Evidence"] (18 December 2017). USAID Learning Lab. Retrieved 31 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Key lessons of evidence-based policy-making===
Six key lessons have been developed, which are:

# Policy processes are complex and rarely linear or logical and simply presenting information to policy-makers and expecting them to act upon it is very unlikely to work. Policy processes are not purely linear as they have various stages that each take varying lengths of time to complete and may in fact be conducted simultaneously. Strategies must be fluid.
# Policy is often only weakly informed by research-based evidence due to information gaps, secrecy, the need for speedy responses, political expediency and the fact that policy makers are rarely scientists.
#  Research-based evidence can contribute to policies that have a dramatic impact on lives. Success stories quoted in the UK's Department for International Development's (DFID) new research strategy include a 22% reduction in neonatal mortality in Ghana as a result of helping women begin breastfeeding within one hour of giving birth, and a 43% reduction in deaths among HIV positive children using a widely available antibiotic.
#  The need for a holistic understanding of the context in which the policy is to be implemented.
#  [[Policy entrepreneur]]s need additional skills to influence policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.jpart.a037081 |title=Policy Entrepreneurs: Their Activity Structure and Function in the Policy Process |journal=Journal of Public Administration Research and Theory |year=1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They need to be political fixers, able to understand the politics and identify the key players. They need to be good storytellers, able to synthesise simple compelling stories from the results of the research. They need to be good networkers to work effectively with all the other stakeholders, and they need to be good engineers, building a programme that pulls all of this together.
#  Policy entrepreneurs need clear intent – they need to really want to do it. Turning a researcher into a policy entrepreneur, or a research institute or department into a policy-focused think tank involves a fundamental re-orientation towards policy engagement rather than academic achievement; engaging much more with the policy community; developing a research agenda focusing on policy issues rather than academic interests; acquiring new skills or building multidisciplinary teams; establishing new internal systems and incentives; spending much more on communications; producing a different range of outputs; and working more in partnerships and networks.

These lessons show that the relationship between research, policy and practice is complex, multi-factoral, non-linear, and highly context specific.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; What works in one situation may not work in another. Developing effective strategies in complex environments is not straightforward. Simple tools such as cost–benefit analysis, logical frameworks, traditional project management tools and others may not work on their own, as they fail to take into account the existing complexity.

Based on research conducted in six Asian and African countries, the Future Health Systems consortium has identified a set of key strategies for improving uptake of evidence in to policy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/1478-4505-6-4 |title=Exploring evidence-policy linkages in health research plans: A case study from six countries |journal=Health Research Policy and Systems |volume=6 |year=2008 |last1=Syed |first1=Shamsuzzoha B |last2=Hyder |first2=Adnan A |last3=Bloom |first3=Gerald |last4=Sundaram |first4=Sandhya |last5=Bhuiya |first5=Abbas |last6=Zhenzhong |first6=Zhang |last7=Kanjilal |first7=Barun |last8=Oladepo |first8=Oladimeji |last9=Pariyo |first9=George |last10=Peters |first10=David H }}&lt;/ref&gt; including: improving the technical capacity of policy-makers; better packaging of research findings; use of social networks; establishment of fora to assist in linking evidence with policy outcomes.&lt;ref name="National Policy-Makers Speak"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyder|first=A|title=National Policy-Makers Speak Out: Are Researchers Giving Them What They Need?|journal=Health Policy and Planning|date=14 June 2010|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/national-policy-makers-speak-out-are-researchers-giving-them.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2009.12.006 |pmid=20227095 |title=Stakeholder analysis for health research: Case studies from low- and middle-income countries |journal=Public Health |volume=124 |issue=3 |pages=159–66 |year=2010 |last1=Hyder |first1=A |last2=Syed |first2=S |last3=Puvanachandra |first3=P |last4=Bloom |first4=G |last5=Sundaram |first5=S |last6=Mahmood |first6=S |last7=Iqbal |first7=M |last8=Hongwen |first8=Z |last9=Ravichandran |first9=N |last10=Oladepo |first10=O |last11=Pariyo |first11=G |last12=Peters |first12=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAPID Outcome Mapping Approach===
ROMA approach takes these lessons into account has been field tested through more than 40 workshops and training courses worldwide. It is an eight-step approach for each of which the ODI has developed resources and policy tools to ensure each step is comprehensively addressed:

#  Define a clear, overarching policy objective.
#  Map the policy context around that issue and identify the key factors that may influence the policy process. The RAPID framework provides a useful checklist of questions.
#  Identify the key influential stakeholders. RAPID’s Alignment, Interest and Influence Matrix (AIIM) can be used to map actors along three dimensions: the degree of alignment (i.e. agreement) with the proposed policy, their level of interest in the issue, and their ability to exert influence on the policy process.
#  Develop a [[theory of change]] - identify the changes needed among them if they are to support the desired policy outcome.
#  Develop a strategy to achieve the milestone changes in the process - Force Field Analysis is a flexible tool that can be used to further understand the forces supporting and opposing the desired policy change and suggest concrete responses.
#  Ensure the engagement team has the competencies required to operationalise the strategy.
#  Establish an action plan for meeting the desired policy objective - useful tools include the RAPID Information matrix, DFID’s log frame and IDRC’s Outcome Mapping Strategy Map among them.
#  Develop a monitoring and learning system, not only to track progress, make any necessary adjustments and assess the effectiveness of the approach, but also to learn lessons for the future.

An example of ROMA approach can be seen in the case of the Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System (WEMS) Initiative &lt;ref&gt;World Wildlife Day (3 March 2014). [http://wems-initiative.org/ Evidence Based Policy-Making in Addressing Wildlife Crime]. Wildlife Enforcement Monitoring System Initiative. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; where a systematic approach of agreement has brought its implementation in Africa.

===Results===
This has resulted in:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;

#  Over 50 case studies on successful evidence-based policy engagement have been compiled, a network
#  Development and facilitation of the evidence-based policy in Development Network (ebpdn), which links more than 20 institutional partners and thousands of practitioners working on evidence-based policy processes.
#  Creating an array of practical toolkits designed with [[civil society organisation]]s, researchers and progressive policy makers in mind. For example, at the recent Tokyo Conference on Combating Wildlife crime, [[United Nations University]] and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] presented the first case of evidence based policy making maps on enforcement and compliance of CITES convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestrygis.com/wems/index.html Evidence Based Policy-Making in Addressing Wildlife Crime]. United Nations University. Retrieved 10 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Direct support to civil society organisations (CSOs) to provide training in policy influencing and strategic communication.
# Strengthening the capacity for the UK [[Department for International Development]] (DFID) to influence other actors.

==The Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy==

The Coalition is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, whose mission is to increase government effectiveness through the use of rigorous evidence about “what works.” Since 2001, the Coalition's work with U.S. Congressional and Executive Branch officials has advanced evidence-based reforms in U.S. social programs, which have been enacted into law and policy. The Coalition has no affiliation with any programs or program models, and no financial interest in the policy ideas it supports, enabling it to serve as an independent, objective source of expertise to government officials on evidence-based policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coalition4evidence.org The Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy].

The '''Expedited Funds Availability Act''' (EFA or EFAA) was enacted in 1987 by the [[United States Congress]] for the purpose of standardizing hold periods on deposits made to [[commercial bank]]s and to regulate institutions' use of deposit holds. It is also referred to as '''Regulation CC''' or '''Reg CC''', after the [[Federal Reserve]] regulation that implements the act. The law is codified in Title 12, Chapter 41 of the [[United States Code|US Code]] and Title 12, Part 229 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]]{{ref|1}}.

== Disclosure ==
Financial institutions must disclose their hold policies to all account holders, and make the policy available in written form upon request by any customer. It must also be provided at the time of opening of all new accounts.

Additional disclosures are required on deposit slips, at [[automated teller machine]]s, and when the policy is changed in any way.

== Types of hold ==
Regulation CC stipulates four types of holds that a bank may place on a [[Cheque|check deposit]] at its discretion.  Each has its own qualifications and it is legal for the bank to place any type where the requirements are met, although bank policy may instruct that the type of hold placed be the one that holds the most funds the longest that can be applied legally.

As of February 27, 2010, there is only one check processing region for the entire United States. Therefore, all checks are now local.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20091231a.htm Amendments to Appendix A of Regulation CC.] (Federal Reserve website) "... the amendments are effective February 27, 2010.  At that time, there will only be a single check-processing region for purposes of Regulation CC and there will no longer be any checks that are nonlocal."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbservices.org/communications/check_restructuring.html Federal Reserve Banks' Check Restructuring Resource Center]. Top-level page pointing to more detailed pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Regarding insurance checks''', if the insurance check is drawn on an in-state bank funds will be available on the 5th business day; if the insurance check is drawn on an out-of-state bank funds will be available on the 7th business day.

There are a few exceptions to these guidelines that are important to note.  If an account owner is depositing into an account that does not qualify for the exception hold but also owns another account that does qualify, then the Exception NSF Hold can be placed.  In the same manner, if an account owner is depositing into an account that has been open for less than 30 days but owns another account that has been open greater than 30 days, the New Account Hold cannot be legally placed.

There are certain items that present less risk to financial institutions and thus are subject to expedited availability under the stipulations of Regulation CC.  The following items must have the first $5000 available for the Statutory, Large Deposit and New Account Hold by the first business day following the deposit:

*Cashier's checks, certified checks, or teller's checks&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;;
*Postal money orders;
*U.S. Treasury checks;
*Checks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or Federal Home Loan Bank;
*Any check issued by a state, city, county, or other municipality;
*Any check drawn from another account at the depository institution.

For each of these items, the item must be presented for deposit into the payee's account for it to receive expedited fund availability; when one of these checks is presented for deposit into a third party account, it loses its preferential treatment.  Also, the bank may require use of a special deposit slip or envelope for next-day availability of cashier's checks, certified checks, teller's checks, or state &amp; local government checks; if it does so, it must notify customers and tell them how to obtain the special slip or envelope.

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Regulation CC defines a "cashier's check" as a check that is issued by a bank, drawn on that same bank, is a direct liability of the bank, and signed by one or more officers of that bank.  Though the term "teller's check" is commonly used only by Federal credit unions, under Regulation CC '''any''' check "drawn by the bank, and drawn on another bank or payable through or at a bank" is a "teller's check" if issued "for remittance purposes".  "Official Checks" or "Bank Checks" may not qualify as "cashier's checks" under Regulation CC, but they usually qualify for next-day availability as "teller's checks".''

== Payment of interest ==
According to the regulation, interest-bearing accounts shall receive earnings from funds from the time they are collected by the depository institution, regardless of hold lengths.

== Enforcement ==
Under the act, enforcement is divided by the type of institution, respective to each type's mandated oversight authority:
*For national banks, and federal branches and agencies of foreign banks, the act is enforced by the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]];
*For members of the [[Federal Reserve System]] who are not national banks, and for offices, branches, and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States (who are not federal branches and agencies of foreign banks), the provisions are enforced by the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve]];
*In the case of banks insured by the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] who are not members of the Federal Reserve System, and insured state branches of foreign banks, enforcement falls to the Board of Directors of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC);
*The Director of the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] is responsible for enforcing the provisions of the act in the case of savings associations whose deposits are insured by the FDIC;
*Federal credit unions or [[credit union]]s insured by the [[National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund]] are subject to enforcement of the act by the [[National Credit Union Administration Board]].

Awards for damages are limited under the regulation, including not more than $1000 in addition to actual damages for individual actions, and not more than the lesser of $500,000 or 1% of the net worth of the bank, in addition to actual damages, for class actions.

==Related legislation==
On June 9, 2014, the [[United States House of Representatives]] passed {{USBill|113|HR|1679}} ''To amend the Expedited Funds Availability Act to clarify the application of that Act to American Samoa and the Northern Mariana Islands.''&lt;ref name=1679actions&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1679 - Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1679/actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill, if it were to become law, would extend "by two business days, for [[American Samoa]], any time periods established for large or redeposited check, repeated overdraft, reasonable cause, or other emergency exceptions to the 30-day funds availability requirements for deposits in an depository institution account by a new depositor."&lt;ref name=1679sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1679 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1679|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would also apply "this two-day extension to any deposit in an account at a depository institution located in American Samoa by a check drawn on an originating depository institution which is not located in the same state as the receiving depository institution."&lt;ref name="1679sum"/&gt;

It was originally built in 1942 as the '''Clearfield Naval Supply Depot''', which was decommissioned in 1962.

The {{convert|680|acre|ha|adj=on}} Freeport Center consists of 78 buildings, totaling more than {{convert|7000000|sqft|m2}}. 

Buildings range in size from {{convert|4000|sqft|m2}} to {{convert|400000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeportcenter.com Freeport Center website]&lt;/ref&gt; Most buildings have a [[Rail transport|railroad]] [[loading dock]] on one side, and a truck loading dock on the other. 

About 70 companies have manufacturing and distribution facilities in the Freeport Center, including [[Lifetime Products]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifetime.com/company/pressreleases.aspx#242 Lifetime Products press release]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alliant Techsystems]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atk.com atk website]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Don Julio Foods]], and [[Utility Trailer Manufacturing Company]], as well as being the former headquarters of defunct roller coaster company [[Arrow Dynamics]].

The Freeport Center’s name is a reference to Utah’s Freeport Law, enacted in 1988. This law exempts [[inventory]] held for sale from [[property tax]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.areadevelopment.com/stateResources/utah/utIncentives.shtml  Area Development Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

''For the art, see [[stained glass fusing]].''

'''Fusing''' is a type of [[manufacturing]] process for joining or terminating [[electromagnet|electrical magnet]] wire, that is coated with a varnish (film) type [[Electrical insulation|insulation]], to itself or some type of electrical terminal, without prior removal of the insulation. During the fusing process, the varnish film insulation is [[vaporize]]d automatically. The entire process takes between a quarter of a second to 50 seconds, depending upon the [[geometry]] of the wires being joined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1450">'''Gross Merchandise Volume''' (alternatively Gross Merchandise Value or '''GMV''') is a term used in [[online retailing]] to indicate a total sales dollar value for merchandise sold through a particular marketplace over a certain time frame. Site revenue comes from fees and is different from the dollar value of items sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gross-merchandise-value.asp|title=Gross Merchandise Value|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2008-11-01|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMV for e-commerce retail companies means sale price charged to the customer multiplied by the number of items sold. For example, if a company sells 10 books at $100, the GMV is $1,000. This is also considered as "gross revenue". In this case, the business model is based on a retail model, where the company basically purchases the items, maintains inventory (if need be) and finally, sells or delivers the items to customers. It does not tell the net sales as GMV does not include discounts, costs involved and returns of products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scmp.com/tech/e-commerce/article/2119589/explainer-what-gmv-gross-merchandise-volume|title=Explainer: What is the big deal about gross merchandise volume?|work=South China Morning Post|access-date=2018-06-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management''' (IWFM; formerly the '''British Institute of Facilities Management''', BIFM) is a [[United Kingdom]]-based [[professional association]] for the [[facility management|facilities management]] sector.

==History==
BIFM was formed in 1993&lt;ref name="About"/&gt; to promote the development of facilities management as a critical, professional and strategic business discipline.&lt;ref name="Atkin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkin |first1=Brian |last2=Brooks |first2=Adrian |title=Total Facilities Management |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=London |isbn=9781444316131 |page=4 |edition=3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2018 the BIFM had around 17,000 individual members.&lt;ref name="FMJ-31May2018"/&gt;

BIFM was a founding member of the [[Global Facility Management Association (Global FM)]],&lt;ref&gt;https://globalfm.org/home-3/member-organisation/&lt;/ref&gt; and a full member of the [[Construction Industry Council]].&lt;ref name="CICmem"&gt;{{cite web |title=CIC Members |url=http://cic.org.uk/about-us/cic-members.php |website=Construction Industry Council |accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, the BIFM proposed changing its name to the Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management and attaining [[Royal charter|chartered]] body status.&lt;ref name="FMJ-31May2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=OBeirne |first1=Sarah |title=FM Clinic: Debate on BIFM’s proposed rebrand and application for chartered body status |url=http://www.fmj.co.uk/fm-clinic-debate-on-bifms-proposed-rebrand-and-application-for-chartered-body-status/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=Facilities Management Journal |date=31 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FMW-4Jun2018"&gt;{{cite news |title=Working up a theme |url=http://www.fm-world.co.uk/news/news-analysis/working-up-a-theme/ |accessdate=8 June 2018 |work=FM World |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change was implemented in November 2018.&lt;ref name="Obeirne-16Nov2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Obeirne |first1=Sarah |title=BIFM makes big switch to IWFM with a new ten point plan |url=https://www.fmj.co.uk/bifm-makes-big-switch-to-iwfm-with-a-new-ten-point-plan/ |accessdate=29 November 2018 |work=Facilities Management Journal |date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2235">'''Jesse Simons''' (November 5, 1917 &amp;ndash; July 8, 2006) was an American labor [[arbitrator]], who helped set in place a system of [[collective bargaining]] between [[Government of New York City|New York City]] (NYC) and its employees.

==Early life==

Simons was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], he attended the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Washington]] and the [[City University of New York|University of New York]], he failed to earn a degree from any of these institutions. Simons was a firm believer in [[Trade union|unionism]] and his politics during the 1930s and 1940s were [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]]. During this period, he held a variety of jobs from [[machinist]] to [[Linotype machine|Linotype]] operator. From 1944-1946, Simons served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]].

==Career==
After [[demobilization]], Simons became Political Director of the [[International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union]]. He later became manager of Personnel and Industrial Relations for the [[New York Post]], a position he held until 1961.

From 1963-1966, Simons directed the [[American Arbitration Association]]'s Labor Management Institute. Following two lengthy strikes in 1965 by NYC employees, Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] convened a committee to create an independent agency to oversee municipal labor relations. Simons was an adviser to this committee and his contribution ultimately helped to bring about the NYC Collective Bargaining Law (1967). This law led to the formation of the NYC Office of Collective Bargaining, who mediate and arbitrate between the city and the bulk of its employees.

Simons died in New York, at age 88, from [[Congestive heart failure|heart failure]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/nyregion/12simons.html?ex=1310356800&amp;en=59ee2c785d68122b&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Kenya Flower Council--&gt;
The '''Kenya Flower Council'''&lt;ref name=161027kfc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenyarep-jp.com/business/industry/f_kfc_e.html|title=Kenya Flower Industry: Kenya Flower Council (KFC)|publisher=The Embassy of the Republic of Kenya in Japan|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a voluntary body of [[trade association|industrial association]] for [[floral industry|floriculture]] in [[Kenya]]. Its secretariat is in [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenyaflowercouncil.org/?page_id=74|title=Mrs. Jane Ngig—Chief Executive Officer, KFC Secretariat |publisher=|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Trade association for flower industry==

The Council is involved in issues of industry [[lobbying]], [[worker safety]], [[environmental protection]], [[regulation|industrial regulation]], industrial development and flower farming company accreditation, as well as more weighty issues of global [[carbon dioxide emission]]s and international industrial diplomacy. KFC Code of Practice (CoP) is assigned to the whole flower industry in Kenya, promoting good agricultural practice, sustainability and social accountability, while hygiene health and safety is highly respected along with capacity building, environmental protection and conservation to adhere to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowerweb.com/en/company/23695/Kenya+Flower+Council|title=Kenya Flower Council—Flowers And Plants Growing, Trade and Agriculture Association|publisher=Kenya Flower Council|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Kenya did not export floriculture crops, and it is currently the major exporter to the European Union, as an exporter of 38% of cut flower into the EU. The main European Union markets are Holland, United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Switzerland.Kenya’s export of cut flowers for international flower market started to expand in 1990, both in volume and value year by year. It was 10,946 tons in 1988, 86,480 tons (2006) and reached 122,825 tons in 2015. According to Kenya National Bureau of Statistics in 2014, the flower farming industry earned Kshs 54.6 billion.&lt;ref name=161027statistics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kenyaflowercouncil.org/?page_id=94|title=Industry Statistics|publisher=Kenya Flower Council|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kenya Flower Council was formed in 1996 to represent those independent Kenyan [[floriculture|cut flower]] and [[ornamental plant]] growers with [[exporting|exporters]], and its membership counts approximately 100 enlisted as of August 2016&lt;ref name=2016membership&gt;Major players in the industry includes but not limited to Finlay Flowers Ltd, Flamingo HorOculture Kenya Ltd, Kariki Group, Mzurri Farms, P. J. Dave Farms, Sian Agriflora Farms, and Vegpro Group. {{cite web|url=http://www.kenyarep-jp.com/business/industry/KFC-Grower%20member%20%20contacts-August%20%202016.pdf|title=KFC Members List and Flowers Grown as of August 2016|publisher=The Embassy of the Republic of Kenya in Japan|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 3,000 small scale out growers. 

That membership provides over 65% of the flowers exported.&lt;ref name=161027statistics/&gt; The increasing demand in the UK market especially on mixed bouquets encouraged more direct sales from Kenya, in contrast to the conventional auction system.&lt;ref name=161027statistics/&gt; However, as Kenyan flower industry has grown to dominate the UK market, social and environmental strains was caused rooted in the rose farms surrounding Lake Naivasha which was brought to the attention of EU media.{{refn|name=2015britain|group=note|Labors coming into the area from other regions was benefited with the booming flower industry, however led tension among  local society which was predominantly supported by grazing.  Being dependent on the lake waters and requires farming lands, floriculture industry caused dilemma for economic growth against ecosystem preservation, as water access for herd began to compete with farming water intake, or grazing land was decreased by developing farm lands. In short, the tension and conflict of interest were indicated for Masaii herders against Kikuyu flower farmers.&lt;ref name=ft1502&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4839da78-b8fa-11e4-a8d0-00144feab7de|title=Why flowers in UK vases are causing tensions in Kenya|newspaper=Financial Times|date=2015-02-28|last=Wilson|first=Matthew |access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Lobbying in the EU==

In 2015, Kenya Flower Council announced to the flower industry to put up programs and implement compliance regulation nationwide in response to the importing nations and their move for stringent regulations; the import taxes EU imposed on Kenyan cut flowers in October 2014 was seen slowing down the industry.&lt;ref name=1503cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/03/16/africa/kenya-flower-industry/|title=Got roses this Valentine's Day? They probably came from Kenya|last=Veselinovic|first=Milena|newspaper=CNN|date=2015-03-06 |access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the planning and advice the Council provided for the reform failed to meet the timetable set by the EU to result in penalty money on the industry.{{refn|name=guardian|group=note|Europe imposed tariffs on Kenya’s cut flowers in October 2015, and local flower companies in Kenya reacted with plans to meet the requirements by political and commercial plans. Kenya's failure to sign a new trade agreement cost  €3m (£2.3m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jan/16/kenya-flower-trade-eu-pressure|title=EU trade agreements threaten to crush Kenya’s blooming flower trade|newspaper=the Guardian|series=Supply Chain|last=Moulds|first=Josephine|date=2015-01-16 |access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With a financial aid of 400,000 US dollars provided by the Dutch government for the  program implementation, the KFC anticipated to involve all sectors in the Kenyan flower industry by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name=2015compliance&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flowerweb.com/en/article/169517/Kenya%E2%80%99s-flower-standards-to-be-in-place-by-end-of-2015|title=Kenya’s flower standards to be in place by end of 2015|publisher=Flowerweb |location=NAIROBI, (Xinhua)|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kenya provides 40 percent of all European Union imports with its floricultural produces, and the risk to lose competition against other developing cut flower exporters in the world put the industry in Kenya to meet the EU regulation in the form of tariff, which was lifted in December 2015.&lt;ref name=2015compliance/&gt; 

==Industrial development schemes==

Rwanda is negotiated for ODA partnership with Kenyan government to gain support on cut flower industry. A development of flower park is initiated by KFC, expanding over 35 hectare is discussed located in 30 kilometers' radius from  Kigali, Rwanda's capital. By 2017, estimated income to Rwandan government from the local flower farming industry will be in excess of  $200 million, or annual yield of three million cut flowers&lt;ref name=1503cnn/&gt;

==Auditing and accreditation activities==

Domestically, the Kenya Flower Council (KFC) is affiliated with the [[Horticultural Crops Development Authority]] (HCDA),&lt;ref name=161027hcda&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airc.go.ke/index.php?option=com_contact&amp;view=contact&amp;id=192%3Ahorticultural-crops-development-authority-hcda&amp;catid=116%3Aregulatory-licensing-a-marketing-agencies&amp;Itemid=98|title=Horticultural Crops Development Authority (HCDA)|publisher=Agricultural Information Resource Centre (AIRC)|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Fresh Produce Exporters Association of Kenya (FPEAK) and with the [[Kenya Bureau of Standards]] (KEBS).  It publishes a detailed Code of Practice (CoP) and employs a rating system for its member companies, involving Gold Standard ranking, Silver Standard ranking and Associate rankings.
Globally, the board subscribes to the [[Good Agricultural Practices]] guideline system of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), and to [[GLOBALG.A.P]]. A yearly growth of 5 percent is anticipated for the flower industry in Kenya between 2016 and 2020,&lt;ref name=161027kfc/&gt; and the government is going to continue investments as well as to accumulate and expand growth rate each year. According to KEBS in 2014, the floriculture industry earned Kshs (Kenya Shillings) 54.6 billion.&lt;ref name=161027statistics/&gt;

HCDA reported provisional statistics in 2015 that Kshs 62.9 billion was earned by the Kenyan cut flower industry.&lt;ref name=161027industry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kenyarep-jp.com/business/industry/f_index_e.html|title=The Kenya Flower Industry|publisher=The Embassy of the Republic of Kenya in Japan|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Léopold Louis-Dreyfus''' (5 March 1833 – 9 April 1915) was a French [[investor]] and [[businessman]], founder of the [[Louis Dreyfus Group]], and [[patriarch]] of the Louis-Dreyfus family.

The French government awarded him the title [[Legion of Honor|Commander of the Legion of Honour]] in 1912.&lt;ref name="ajc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ajcarchives.org/AJC_DATA/Files/1912_1913_4_YearReview.pdf |title=American Jewish Yearbook: A List of Events in 5672 (July 1, 1911 to June 30, 1912) |quote="Leopold Louis Dreyfus, Consul-General for Roumania In Paris, promoted to grade of Commander of Legion of Honor"|publisher=[[American Jewish Year Book]]|accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born Léopold Dreyfus to a [[Jewish]] family in [[Sierentz]] in [[Alsace]] in north-eastern France.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/groupe-louis-dreyfus-s-a-history/ Funding Universe: "Groupe Louis Dreyfus S.A. History"] retrieved August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BloombergWidow&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-31/louis-dreyfus-widow-ousts-men-running-commodities-giant-as-newest-chairman.html Bloomberg: "Louis-Dreyfus Widow Chairman Ousts Men Running Commodities Giant" By Alan Katz] January 31, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were Louis Lemlé Dreyfus (1798), a farmer, and Jeannette Victoire (''née'' Hildenfinger; 1803–1837).

==Business==
As a youth, the younger Dreyfus made frequent trips to nearby [[Basel, Switzerland]], delivering grain for sale from the family farm. In 1851, he began trading wheat from neighbouring farms. He founded a company under his father's name, as he was too young to use his own.&lt;ref name=LDCommodities&gt;[http://www.ldcommodities.com/about-us/our-heritage/ Louis Dreyfus Commodities website: "Key eras in our history"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729060628/http://www.ldcommodities.com/about-us/our-heritage/ |date=29 July 2013 }} retrieved August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The younger Dreyfus later changed his surname to Louis-Dreyfus, but kept the company name without the hyphen.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt;

In 1858, after rapid growth, he moved the company to [[Berne, Switzerland]],&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt; where it expanded its operations throughout Europe by purchasing grain from the "[[breadbasket]]s" of Eastern Europe and transporting it to the hungry markets in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt; In 1864, the company moved to [[Zurich, Switzerland]] and in 1872, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]] when France ceded Alsace to Germany, Louis Dreyfus chose French citizenship. He moved to the shipping port of [[Marseille]] and by 1875 had moved his company's headquarters to [[Paris]].&lt;ref name=LDCommodities /&gt;&lt;ref name="ld"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.louisdreyfus.com/about-us/history/ |title=About Us: History |website=louisdreyfus.com |accessdate=9 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of a transcontinental railroad in Europe combined with a more reliable shipping network and better access to market information – after the development of the telegraph and telephone – enabled the Louis Dreyfus Group to grow rapidly via [[arbitrage]]: the taking advantage of price differentials between locations. In 1883, the Louis Dreyfus Group was one of the first companies to engage in [[futures trading]] at the Liverpool Corn Trade Association, allowing it to both buy and sell commodities simultaneously.&lt;ref name=LDCommodities /&gt;&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt; By 1900, the Louis Dreyfus Group was the world's largest grain trader.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt;

In 1905, the Banque Louis-Dreyfus was founded to help finance the company's operations in grain markets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130816082844/http://d348925.u103.swisscenter.com/-History,17-.html Swiss Center] retrieved August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the company expanded internationally: in 1909, it opened an office in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] and began exporting durum wheat; in 1911, it started trading cotton in [[Brazil]]; and in 1913, it set up operations in [[Melbourne, Australia]].&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt; In 1915, Léopold Louis-Dreyfus died turning over the family company to sons Louis and Charles.&lt;ref name=FundingUniverse /&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1860, Léopold Louis-Dreyfus married Émilie Lang (29 January 1840 – 7 December 1918), daughter of Isaac Lang and Rosalie (''née'' Aron) Lang. They had three sons: [[Louis Louis-Dreyfus]] (1867–1940), [[Charles Louis-Dreyfus]] (1870–1929), and Robert Louis-Dreyfus (1877–1907).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=U9bkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA349&amp;lpg=PA349&amp;dq=leopold+louis+dreyfus#v=onepage&amp;q=leopold%20louis%20dreyfus The Cyclopedia of India: biographical, historical, administrative, commercial] retrieved August 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 20th century, the Louis-Dreyfus family was described as one of the "five great fortunes of France".&lt;ref&gt;''Buried By The Times: The Holocaust And America's Most Important Newspaper'', Laurel Leff, Cambridge University Press, March 2005, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis-Dreyfus also served as Consul-General for the [[Kingdom of Romania]] in Paris. He was awarded the title of [[Legion of Honour|Commander of the Legion of Honour]] ({{lang-fr|link=no|Commandeur de la Légion d'honneur}}) on 19 April 1912.&lt;ref name="ajc" /&gt;

==Legacy==

Léopold Louis-Dreyfus died in 1915 and was succeeded at the [[Louis Dreyfus Group]] by his sons Louis and Charles, who expanded the company in the Americas and in the [[Russian Empire]] (prior to the 1917 Revolution).&lt;ref name="ld"/&gt; In 2013, the Louis Dreyfus Group is considered to be one of the "big four" global food trading companies in the world competing with [[Archer Daniels Midland]], [[Bunge Limited]], and [[Cargill Inc.]]&lt;ref name=BloombergWidow /&gt;

{{one source|date=November 2017}}

'''Macromanagement''' is a management theory with two different approaches to the definition that both share a common idea; management from afar. 

Contrary to [[micromanagement]] where managers closely observe and control the works of their employees, macromanagement is a more independent style of organizational management. Managers step back and give employees the freedom to do their job how they think it is best done, so long as the desired result is reached. This is the most commonly applied understanding of macromanagement. 

Both styles of management are viewed as a negative when taken to an extreme, so it is important for organizations to develop a balance of micro- and macromanagement practices and understand when to apply which. 

The second interpretation of macromanagement is when an organization views itself as a social [[institution,]] orienting its goals and purpose toward serving society. To do this, they align the organization’s values, norms, ethics with those of the society they are immersed in. In 1971, Alan Wells defined a social institution as “patterns of rules, customs, norms, beliefs and roles that are instrumentally related to the needs and purposes of society.” Other examples of social institutions in this respect include government and religious organizations, some more in-line with serving society that others.  

This interpretation of macromanagement is less about managing employees, but rather managing the organization from a broader perspective that is oriented toward the future. An organization that practices macromanagement greatly considers the future of the organization, the future of society, and their impact on one another.

'''Managed float regime''' is the current [[international finance|international financial]] environment in which [[exchange rate]]s fluctuate from day to day, but [[central bank]]s attempt to influence their [[country|countries']] exchange rates by buying and selling [[currency|currencies]] to maintain a certain range. The peg used is known as a [[crawling peg]].

In an increasingly integrated world economy, the currency rates impact any given country's economy through the [[trade balance]]. In this aspect, almost all currencies are ''managed'' since [[central bank]]s or [[governments]] intervene to influence the value of their currencies. According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], as of 2014, 82 countries and regions used a managed float, or 43% of all countries, constituting a plurality amongst exchange rate regime types.&lt;ref name=Nikkei&gt;{{cite news|title=IMF finds more countries adopting managed floating exchange rate system|url=http://asia.nikkei.com/Markets/Currencies/IMF-finds-more-countries-adopting-managed-floating-exchange-rate-system|accessdate=5 March 2015|work=Nikkei Asian Review|agency=Nikkei|date=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manthos Rizaris''' ({{lang-el|Μάνθος Ριζάρης}}, 1764–1824) and '''Georgios Rizaris''' ({{lang-el|Γεώργιος Ριζάρης}}, 1769–1842) were [[Greeks|Greek]] benefactors, merchants and members of the organization [[Filiki Eteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430165541/http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm |archivedate=2008-04-30 |df= }}(greek, english)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm Biography, pictures of their bequests, and their testament] (Greek) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430165541/http://lyk-rizar.att.sch.gr/RIZAREIOIDRYMA.htm |date=2008-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rizari brothers were born in the village of [[Monodendri (Ioannina)|Monodendri]] of [[Zagori]] region ([[Epirus]]). They lost both parents at an early age. Manthos Rizaris, the elder brother, moved to [[Moscow]], in order to work in his uncle’s trading business. At 1806 Georgios followed. They got involved in trade and made a fortune.

At 1817 Manthos became member of Filiki Eteria, and supported financially with huge amounts of money the [[Greek Revolution]]: a total donation of over 50.000 Russian rubles was offered for the Revolution’s objectives. Manthos, died at 1824 in Russia.

Both brothers supported the independence of Greece . With their financial aid helped: the poor, the orphans, the ones that suffered because of the armed conflicts that took place during this period. After Manthos’ death, Georgios moved to [[Odessa]], and continued his business there. He found in his home place (Monodendri) the ''School of Greek Courses'' (Greek: Σχολή των Ελληνικών Μαθημάτων). Many orphans were awarded with full scholarships, including full coverage of their living costs.

At 1837 George Rizaris settled in Athens, his goal was to found a Religious Institution in the newly formed [[Greece|Greek state]] that would prepare educated priests. At 1843 after his death, the Hieratical school has started to function. In gratitude for their contribution, the school, was named: [[Rizarios Hieratical School]]. The school continues to function as a religious and educational institution today and it is based in [[Halandri]], [[Athens]].

Moreover, they have founded a number of schools in their home place Monodendri and in Epirus region.
Their bequests continue to offer to Greek education and Greek Orthodox church.

'''Marat Manaf oglu Manafov''' was an [[Azerbaijan]]i businessman and lawyer who disappeared in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], in 1999. He was described as the "right-hand man" of Azeri president [[Heydar Aliyev]] and was a negotiator for contracts in [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan's petroleum market]].

==Early life and education==
Manafov was born in [[Stepanakert/Khankendi]], capital of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast]]. His family moved to [[Baku]] in 1960.

He studied geology at [[&lt;ref&gt;Baku&lt;/ref&gt; State University]], then moved to the Arctic to work, where he finished his degree by correspondence. He then returned to school to study law in the [[Siberia]]n city of [[Tyumen]], which has a prominent oil and gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ivanayeva|first1=Tatiana|title=Фахраддин Манафов: Я не пытаюсь делать то, чего не умею|url=http://www.furor.az/index.php/litsa/litso-nomera/item/191-fakhraddin-manafov-ya-ne-pytayus-delat-to-chego-ne-umeyu.html|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=Furor.az|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He soon gained prominence and wealth as an attorney. He moved to Paris for three years, and then to [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].

==Career==
In the early 1990s, he began an import-export business in Slovakia, that had an emphasis on oil, particularly from Azerbaijan and Tyumen.

Manafov became a close confidant of Azeri president [[Heydar Aliyev]], and was described as his "right-hand man."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Leppard |author2=Paul Nuki |author3=Gareth Walsh |title=BP Accused of Backing ‘Arms for Oil’ Coup Says Sunday Times|url=http://asbarez.com/42401/bp-accused-of-backing-arms-for-oil-coup-says-sunday-times/|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|publisher=Azbarez.com|date=March 28, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rfe"&gt;{{cite news|title=Azerbaijan Report: November 2, 2001|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1340906.html|accessdate=5 August 2015|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe]]|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Manafov was appointed by the newly independent Azerbaijani government to negotiate business deals for Azerbaijan's booming oil industry.&lt;ref name="vestikavkaza"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Agakishiev|first1=Ismail|title=История бакинской нефтяной промышленности|url=http://www.vestikavkaza.ru/articles/Istoriya-bakinskoy-neftyanoy-promyshlennosti-46.html|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=Vesti Kavkaza|date=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manafov led the government team controlling what became known as the "[[Contract of the Century]]" that opened up Azerbaijan's vast oil reserves to the west. According to journalist [[Steve LeVine]], Manatov "shook up meetings by pointing a pistol at Western oil executives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reed|first1=Stanley|title=The Oil Rush to the Caspian Sea|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/bw/stories/2007-11-11/the-oil-rush-to-the-caspian-sea|accessdate=5 August 2015|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a meeting with British, Canadian and U.S. oil executives, in which everyone pulled out their business cards, Manafov pulled out a [[9mm]] pistol and placed it on the table. He was later accused of pointing the gun at executives from [[Pennzoil]] and [[BP]], LeVine writes. Manafov claimed he was being followed, which the executives denied. Manafov, who also claimed his accounts had been frozen and his cell phone cut off, stated he had been offered a bribe to cut Pennzoil out of the negotiations. However, executive Tom Doss from [[Amoco]] later discovered his company had indeed paid someone to follow Manafov.&lt;ref name="levine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=LeVine|first1=Steven|authorlink=Steve LeVine|title=The Oil and the Glory: The Pursuit of Empire and Fortune on the Caspian Sea|date=2007|publisher=[[Random House]]|pages=154–156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bl7fomEyyeYC&amp;pg=PT154&amp;lpg=PT154|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manafov was later accused of demanding $360 million in bribes from oil executives, which he claimed would go to Aliyev. He ultimately was expelled from Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="vestikavkaza"/&gt; In late 1999, he disappeared in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], after making allegations about "the secret dealings of the Aliyev family with oil companies," according to an exposé in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. Police stated they were investigating whether he was abducted or killed.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

==Family==
He had five brothers, one of whom is noted actor [[Fakhraddin Manafov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reznikova|first1=Valentina|title=Ролевые игры Фахреддина Манафова|url=http://inieberega.ru/node/160|journal=Inie Berega|language=Russian|volume=2|issue=14|date= 2009|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Patriot Act titles}}
The [[USA PATRIOT Act]] was passed by the [[United States Congress]] in 2001 as a response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. It has ten titles, with the [[USA PATRIOT Act, Title III|third title]] ("Title III: International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001") written to prevent, detect, and prosecute international [[money laundering]] and the financing of [[terrorism]].

Title III is itself divided into three subtitles. The first subtitle, entitled '''Subtitle A: International Counter Money Laundering and Related Measures''', is designed to put measures into place that counter international money laundering. It does this by requiring that financial institutions take several new special measures against money laundering — identification is dealt with particularly; by restricting or prohibiting the use of certain types of bank accounts; through adding further legislation that regulates a financial institution's dealing with foreign concerns; by adding new penalties for non-compliance of the law; and through regulations that are designed to facilitate and encourage reporting and communication between financial institutions and the U.S. government.

==Sec. 311: Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, or international transactions of primary money laundering concern==
{{wikisource|USA PATRIOT Act/Title III}}
A new section was added to Title 31, subchapter IV, chapter 53, subchapter II ("Records and reports on monetary instruments transactions") of the [[U.S. Code]]. The section was 5318A, entitled "Special measures for jurisdictions, financial institutions, or international transactions of primary money laundering concern". It specifies that financial institutions or financial agencies may be required to take special measures when so directed by the [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]]. Any such order by the [[United States Treasury]], with the exception of orders that require additional record keeping or reporting for any transaction over an amount greater than the Secretary describes, is issued with a notice of [[rule making]] regarding the special measure. Orders may not remain in effect for more than 120 days, though any ruling may be extended by the Treasury.

When the Secretary of Treasury orders special measures, that person must first consult with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]], any other appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined in section 3 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]]), the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], the [[National Credit Union Administration Board]] and any other relevant parties the Secretary of Treasury decides to call on. The special measures must take into account whether similar actions were taken by other nations and multilateral groups; whether the measure will cause any competitive disadvantage for U.S. financial organizations; how the timing or impact of the decision will affect legitimate business activities; and what effect the action would have on U.S. national security and foreign policy.

The special measures must be undertaken for all transactions that are made outside the U.S. in areas where money-laundering has been identified as a concern. The measures involve:
# the maintenance of records of the aggregate amount of transactions made in such areas. Such records must include:
#* the identity and address of the participants in a transaction or relationship, including the identity of the originator of any funds transfer;
#* the legal capacity in which a participant in any transaction is acting;
#* the identity of the beneficial owner of the funds involved in any transaction, in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary determines to be reasonable and practicable to obtain and retain the information; and
#* a description of any transaction.
# undertaking reasonable steps to obtain and retain information on foreigners who gain a benefit of ownership of an account which is opened and maintained in the U.S., and yet who do not own the account itself (this is called [[beneficial ownership]])
# the identification of any foreign customers who are authorized to use or route transactions through a [[payable-through account]] in the U.S.

The section also details what is considered a "primary money-laundering concern". The Secretary of Treasury ultimately makes the decision on such areas in consultation with [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]. Several jurisdictional factors must be taken into account, including:
* evidence that [[organized crime]], [[terrorism|international terrorists]], or both, have transacted business in that jurisdiction;
* the extent to which [[bank secrecy]] or special regulatory advantages are given to nonresidents or [[nondomiciliaries]] in the jurisdiction;
* the substance and quality of administration of the bank supervisory and counter-money laundering laws of the jurisdiction;
* the relationship between the volume of financial transactions occurring in the jurisdiction and the size of the economy of the jurisdiction;
* the extent to which the jurisdiction is characterized as an offshore banking or secrecy haven by credible international organizations or multilateral expert groups;
* whether the U.S. has a [[mutual legal assistance treaty]] with the jurisdiction, and the experience of U.S. law enforcement officials and regulatory officials in obtaining information about transactions originating in or routed through or to the jurisdiction; and
* whether there are high levels of official or institutional [[Political corruption|corruption]]
The Secretary of Treasury also considers whether financial institutions facilitate or promote money laundering, balanced against the extent to which they perform and promote legitimate business activities. He or she must also decide whether the financial institutions is undertaking any of the special measures specified above when considering whether the jurisdiction, financial institutions, types of accounts, or transactions are or are not primarily a money laundering concern.

==Sec. 312. Special due diligence for correspondent accounts and private banking accounts==
Extra [[due diligence]] requirements were added to {{usc|31|5318}}. Each financial institution that has a correspondent bank account held and managed on behalf of a non-U.S. person must enable (or in some cases enhance) their due diligence policies, procedures and controls to detect and report instances of money laundering. The due diligence requirements focus on identifying the direct and indirect (beneficial) owners of the accounts.

Financial institutions must now undertake steps to identify the owners of any non-U.S. bank that is not [[public company|publicly listed]], along with the interests of each of the owners in the bank. It is expected that additional scrutiny will be applied by the U.S. institution to such banks to make sure they are not engaging in money laundering. Reasonable efforts must be undertaken to determine whether the non-U.S. bank provides correspondent bank accounts to other foreign banks and, if it is discovered they do, the U.S. financial institution is expected to try to identify the foreign banks the non-U.S. bank deals with.

Similarly, U.S. financial institutions must also identify the nominal and beneficial owners of any private bank account opened and maintained in the U.S. by non-U.S. citizens. The institution must undertake enhanced scrutiny of the account if it is owned by, or is being maintained on behalf of, any [[politician|senior political figure]] where there is reasonable suspicion of corruption. A "private bank account" is defined as any account that has over [[$US]]1 million deposited by one or more people who have a direct or beneficial ownership of the account. Further, the account must be administered in whole or in part by an employee, officer or agent of a financial institution, and who acts as a liaison between the institution and the owners of the account.

==Sec. 313. Prohibition on United States correspondent accounts with foreign shell banks==
{{usc|31|5318}} was amended to prohibit U.S. financial institutions from establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing a [[correspondent account]] in the U.S. for, or on behalf of, a foreign bank that does not have a physical presence in any country (otherwise known as a [[shell bank]]). U.S. financial institutions must also take steps to prevent the indirect servicing of a foreign shell bank by allowing a correspondent account to be established and maintained by another foreign bank who acts on behalf of that foreign shell bank. However, exceptions are made if the shell bank is an affiliate (under the control) of a bank that has a physical presence in the U.S. or if the foreign shell bank is subject to supervision by a banking authority in the non-U.S. country regulating the affiliated depository institution, credit union, or foreign bank.

==Sec. 314. Cooperative efforts to deter money laundering==
In order to foster improved communication between financial institutions, the regulators of the financial institutions and law enforcement authorities the U.S. Treasury secretary was directed to create regulations within 120 days after the enactment of the Patriot Act that set out how information was to be shared. The aim of the act was more to encourage law enforcement authorities and financial regulation agencies to share the information they had on foreign individuals or organisations engaged in terrorism. Due to the complex nature of the task on February 26, 2002 the U.S. Treasury initially put together a proposed rule to amend the [[Code of Federal Regulations]],&lt;ref name=Initial103CFR100&gt;[http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/po1044.htm Treasury announces USA PATRIOT Act Regulations to improve information sharing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415003855/https://www.treas.gov/press/releases/po1044.htm |date=2006-04-15 }}, [[United States Treasury]], February 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; and then on March 14, 2002 they released [https://web.archive.org/web/20051129045328/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm 31 CFR 103.100] which was entitled "Special Information Sharing Procedures To Deter Money Laundering and Terrorist Activity".&lt;ref name=103CFR100&gt;[http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm Also found at] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129045328/http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/08aug20031600/edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2003/julqtr/31cfr103.100.htm |date=2005-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regulation allows [[FinCEN]] to solicit, on behalf of a Federal law enforcement agency, information from a financial institution or group of financial institutions. In order to gain such information, a law enforcement agency must provide a certificate which shows who is the target of the information request — the regulation states that enough information must be provided to the institution to allow them to distinguish between common or similar names — and a contact person from the agency who knows about the request. The financial institution must then expeditiously search records for information that satisfies the request, though at any time the institution can contact the law enforcement agency to clarify the scope or terms of the request. The information that an agency must disclose is:
* any current amounts held for a named suspect
* any account maintained by the suspect during the previous 12 months
* any transaction conducted by or on behalf of a suspected, or any transfer of funds where the suspect was the recipient or the giver of the funds
After identifying the account asked for by FinCEN, the financial institution must provide a report back to FinCEN with:
* the name of the suspect
* the number of accounts owned, or transaction made
* the [[social security number]], taxpayer ID number, passport number, date of birth, address or any other identity information provided by the suspect to the financial institution when they opened their account or performed their transaction

The regulation specifically prohibits the financial institution from using information provided by FinCEN to do anything other than report information back to FinCEN, make a determination whether to do business with the named suspect or suspects, or to help them comply with an order given under the regulation. Furthermore, the financial institution may not disclose that FinCEN made a request for or obtained information to anyone other than FinCEN or to the Federal agency who was using FinCEN to gather information about the suspects. Under the regulation,  financial institutions are expected to maintain appropriate security to keep such information confidential in order to satisfy the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]].

The section also allows financial institutions to share information with other financial institutions when so allowed by the Secretary of Treasury, and they are now legally immune from prosecution if they gather or share information relating to terrorism or financial money-laundering in order to identify and report such activities. The section also gives immunity against breaches of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to any organisation who undertakes actions to comply with this section.

Finally, the section directs the Secretary of Treasury to produce a report semiannually to the financial services industry "containing a detailed analysis identifying patterns of suspicious activity and other investigative insights derived from suspicious activity reports and investigations conducted by Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies". This report must be distributed to every financial institution in the United States.

==Sec. 315. Inclusion of foreign corruption offenses as money laundering crimes==
Section [https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect 1956(c)(7)] of title 18 of the U.S. Code was amended to further include specific acts of unlawful activity in relation to money laundering. Unlawful acts include:
* making a financial transaction in the U.S. in order to commit a crime of violence,&lt;ref name=Sec315_18USC1956c7Bii&gt;Amendment made to {{usc-clause|18|1956|(c)(7)(B)(ii)}} — for some reason an extra parenthesis was inserted into {{usc-clause|18|1956|(c)(7)(B)(iii)}}, according to [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1956-#FN-1 Cornell University], this was probably mistakenly added by law makers&lt;/ref&gt;
* the bribery of public officials and fraudulent dealing with public funds,
* the smuggling or illegal export of controlled munitions;&lt;ref name=Sec315_MunitionsIllegalExport&gt;Illegal export of controlled munitions is defined in the [[United States Munitions List]], which is part of the [[Arms Export Control Act]] ({{usc|22|2778}})&lt;/ref&gt; and the importation or bringing in of any firearm or ammunition not authorised by the U.S. Attorney General,&lt;ref name=315_UnauthorisedFirearmAmmunition&gt;See {{usc-clause|18|922|(l)}} and {{usc-clause|18|925|(d)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the smuggling of any item controlled under the [[Export Administration Regulations]],&lt;ref name="Sec315_ExportAdminRegulations"&gt;Defined in 15 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] 730-774&lt;/ref&gt;
* any offense where the U.S. would be obligated under a [[mutual treaty]] with a foreign nation to [[extradite]] a person, or where the U.S. would need to submit a case against a person for prosecution due to the treaty,
* the importation of falsely classified goods,&lt;ref name=Sec315_FalselyClassifiedGoods&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|541}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[computer crime]],&lt;ref name=Sec315_ComputerCrime&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* any [[felony]] violation of the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938]]

==Sec. 316. Anti-terrorist forfeiture protection==
This section allows the incorrect seizure of the assets of those suspected to be international terrorist to be contested. The contesting party can file a claim under the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] and can either assert as an [[affirmative defense]] that their property was seized improperly or plead an [[innocent owner defense]]. The act also states that:

:''In considering a claim filed under this section, a court may admit evidence that is otherwise inadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, if the court determines that the evidence is reliable, and that compliance with the Federal Rules of Evidence may jeopardize the national security interests of the United States.''

However, this clause does not deny a property owner of their right to contest the confiscation of assets that are suspected to be owned by international terrorists under the [[Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution]] or under the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedures Act]]. It also does not limit the remedies available to property owners defined under the civil forfeiture laws defined in the U.S. Code.&lt;ref name=CivilForfeitureLaws&gt;{{usc|18|981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section also made a technical amendment to the General Rules for Civil Forfeiture Proceedings&lt;ref name=GeneralRulesForCivilForfeitureProcedings&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|983}}&lt;/ref&gt; by amending the definition of the term "civil forfeiture statute" to exclude the [[International Emergency Economic Powers Act]] (IEEPA).&lt;ref name=IEEPA&gt;{{usc-clause|18|983|(i)(2)(D)}} was amended&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 317. Long-arm jurisdiction over foreign money launderers==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect Section 1956 of title 18] was amended in several ways. [[U.S. district court]]s are now given jurisdiction over any foreign person or financial institution where action is undertaken to prosecute them under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures or under the laws of the country in which the foreigner is found. Offenses where the District court can have jurisdiction are in cases where that person commits an offense that involves money laundering under {{usc|18|1956}}; in cases where that person converts property that a U.S. court has seized; or where the foreigner is a financial institution that maintains a bank account at a U.S. financial institution.

The amendment gives the court the power to freeze bank accounts and property so they can satisfy a judgement under 18&amp;nbsp;[[United States Code|USC]]&amp;nbsp;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/usc-cgi/newurl?title=18&amp;section=1956&amp;type=titlesect §&amp;nbsp;1956]. The courts may appoint a [[Federal Receiver]] to seize or control all assets of a defendant in order to satisfy a judgement of the court. The judgement may be a civil judgement about money laundering; the civil or criminal forfeiture of assets;&lt;ref name=Sec317_Forfeiture&gt;Defined in {{usc|18|981}} and {{usc|18|982}}, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; or made against those who act as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]]. The Federal Receiver is appointed by the court after an application is made by a Federal prosecutor or Federal or State regulator, and they must be an officer of the court. The Federal Receiver is governed by {{usc|28|754}} and is able to gain the same information about a defendants assets from FinCen, the Department of Treasury or a foreign government (where a treaty or other agreement is in place with the U.S. government) as a Federal prosecutor.

==Sec. 318. Laundering money through a foreign bank==
This section expanded the definition of a financial institution to be any foreign bank, as defined in section 1 of the [[International Banking Act of 1978]].&lt;ref name=Sec318_sec1IntlBankingAct1978&gt;{{usc|12|3101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 319. Forfeiture of funds in United States Interbank accounts==
Section 319 deals with the forfeiture of funds in [[Interbank account]]s and the ability of Federal banking agencies to subpoena bank records or summons banking staff in order to gain access to bank records. It also gave U.S. courts the authority to order convicted criminal to return property located abroad. Paragraph (c) allowed a (since expired) grace period of 60 days from the enactment of the Act with which financial institutions were required to comply with the provisions of {{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)}}.

Any deposits into foreign banks are considered to be deposited into any Interbank account the foreign bank may have in the U.S., and thus any restraining order, seizure warrant or arrest warrant may be made against the funds in the Interbank account held at a U.S. financial institution, up to the amount deposited in the account at the foreign bank.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-1-A"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(1)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions were made to allow the Attorney General to suspend or stop such a forfeiture if the Attorney General determines that a [[conflict of law]] exists between the laws of the foreign country in which the foreign bank resides in and with the laws of the U.S.. The Attorney General must also decide whether halting such a forfeiture would be in the interest of justice and that it would not harm the national interests of the U.S.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-1-B"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(1)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The funds that are forfeited in the Interbank account can be contested by the foreign bank under the general rules of civil forfeiture proceedings.&lt;ref name="GenRulesCivilForfeitureProc"&gt;The general rules of civil forfeiture proceedings are defined in {{usc|18|983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="18USC981k-3"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government does not need to show that the funds being forfeited are directly traceable to the funds deposited at the foreign bank and the government is also not required to apply {{usc|18|984}}, which deals with the civil forfeiture of [[fungible]] property.&lt;ref name="18USC981k-2"&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(k)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 319 requires a financial institution to respond to a request for information from a Federal banking agency within 120 hours of the receipt of the request. Federal banking agencies can request information relating to any money-laundering activities — financial institutions must provide documentation for any account opened, maintained, administered or managed by the institution in the U.S.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-2"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[summon]]s or [[subpoena]] may be issued to any representative of a foreign bank that as a corresponding account in the U.S. — they may be required to include records (even those maintained outside the U.S.) that relate to the deposit of funds into the foreign bank. The summons may be issued to a bank with a representative in the U.S. or in foreign countries where the U.S. has a mutual legal assistance treat, a [[multilateral agreement]] or where the U.S. can expect that they will respond to a request for international law enforcement assistance.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-A"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign banks who maintain corresponding accounts must maintain records in the U.S. that will identify the owners' real names and addresses. The banks must be able to provide this information within 7 days of receipt of the request.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-B"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a requirement that when so ordered by the Attorney General or the Secretary of Treasury (they must consult each other first) the financial institution must terminate any corresponding accounts within 10 days. Corresponding accounts can be ordered to be closed if the foreign bank fails to comply with a summons or subpoena (see above), or has failed to legally contest the summons in the U.S.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-i"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A financial institution is further protected from liability if they terminate a corresponding relationship in accordance with the section,&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-ii"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(ii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in fact the financial institution faces penalties of [[$US]]10,000 for each day the account remains open after the 10-day limit has expired.&lt;ref name="31USC5318k-3-C-iii"&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(k)(3)(C)(iii)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Code was amended by section 319 to allow a court to order a convicted criminal to return property that is located abroad.&lt;ref name=Sec319_21USC853p&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)}} was amended&lt;/ref&gt; If that property cannot be located, has been transferred or sole, is placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court, is substantially reduced in value, or has been comingled with other property in such a way that it cannot be divided without difficulty&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the court may order that property be forfeited in substitution of the property that must be returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(2)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court can also order that any property beyond the jurisdiction of the court must be returned to the jurisdiction of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(p)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a defendant enters into a pretrial restraint order to stop goods from being seized, then the defendant may be required to deposit the property either into the registry of the court, with the [[United States Marshals Service]], or with the U.S. Secretary of Treasury in an interest-bearing account.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(e)(4)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the defendant refuses the law states that they will be charged with [[contempt of court]] and their final sentence may be enhanced under the [[obstruction of justice]] provision of the [[Federal Sentencing Guidelines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|21|853|(e)(4)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 320. Proceeds of foreign crimes==
The U.S. Code was amended to allow the forfeiture of any property within the jurisdiction of the United States that was gained as the result of an offense against a foreign nation that involves the manufacture, importation, sale, or distribution of a controlled substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|18|981|(A)(1)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 321. Financial institutions specified in Subchapter II of Chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code==
[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode31/usc_sup_01_31_08_IV_10_53_20_II.html Subchapter II of Chapter 53 of Title 31, United States Code] requires certain reports or records from various financial institutions where they have a high degree of usefulness in criminal, tax, or regulatory investigations or proceedings, or in the conduct of intelligence or counterintelligence activities, including analysis, to protect against international terrorism. Section 321 of the USA PATRIOT Act included [[credit union]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5312|(2)(E)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Futures commission merchant]]s, [[commodity trading]] advisors and [[commodity pool operator]]s in its definition of a financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5312|(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also defined in all legislation that the term "Federal functional regulator" includes the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC).

==Sec. 322. Corporation represented by a fugitive==
The U.S. Code was amended to disallow a corporation whose majority shareholder or owner is a [[fugitive]] from mounting an innocent owner defense to contest the forfeiture of property by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2466|(b)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 323. Enforcement of foreign judgments==
The U.S. Code defines the means by which a foreign nation may seek to have a forfeiture or judgement notification enforced by a district court of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|28|2467}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was amended under section 323 by adding a new paragraph that specifies how the U.S. government may apply for a restraining order&lt;ref&gt;Pursuant to {{usc-clause|18|983|(j)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to preserve the availability of property which is subject to a foreign forfeiture or confiscation judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In evaluating whether to issue the restraining order, the court may rely on information provided in an affidavit which describes the overseas investigation that is underway and why the property in question should be restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)(i)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. court may also register and enforce a restraining order that has already been issued by a foreign court and which is certified by the Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(3)(A)(ii)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any objections to the restraining order must not include any made on grounds that are part of any parallel foreign litigation over the same property.

Section 323 places a large emphasis on the ability of a foreign court to follow [[due process]] when considering an application for a forfeiture or confiscation judgement to be registered and enforced in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(b)(1)(c)}} &amp; {{usc-clause|28|2467|(d)(1)(D)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "forfeiture and confiscation" is defined to mean a final order of a foreign nation which compels a person or entity to pay money for "any violation of foreign law that would constitute a violation or an offense for which property could be forfeited under Federal law if the offense were committed in the United States".&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|28|2467|(a)(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sec. 324. Report and recommendation==
Provisions were made to allow the Secretary of Treasury and various other agencies (including the Attorney General, the Federal banking agencies as defined in section 3 of the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]], the National Credit Union Administration Board and the Securities and Exchange Commission) the ability to evaluate the operations of the provisions of title III and make recommendations to Congress. These were to be made within 30 months of the enactment of the Act.

==Sec. 325. Concentration accounts at financial institutions==
A [[concentration account]] is a single account used for the internal purposes of a financial institution to facilitate the processing and settlement of multiple or individual customer transactions within the bank, usually on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ffiec.gov/bsa_aml_infobase/pages_manual/OLM_037.htm Expanded Overview - Concentration Accounts], Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) / Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Examination Manual&lt;/ref&gt; Such accounts can lead to the concealment by financial institutions transactions made by customers, however section 325 bans their use for such purposes by prohibiting financial institutions from allowing clients to direct transactions that move their funds into, out of, or through the concentration accounts of the financial institution. Financial institutions are also prohibited from informing clients about the existence of such accounts and disallows any disclosure that may give customer a way of identifying such accounts that the financial institution may use. The section also requires that financial institutions document and follow methods of identifying where the funds are for each customer in a concentration account that commingles funds belonging to one or more customers.

==Sec. 326. Verification of identification==
The Secretary of the Treasury was given the task of prescribing regulations that set forth the minimum standards that financial institutions must undertake to verify the identity of customers who open accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules implementing section 326 became effective on June 9, 2003, although financial institutions had until October 1, 2003 to
come into compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(6)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minimum requirements under the section require financial institutions to establish procedures to take reasonable and practicable measures to verify the identity of those applying for an account with the institution;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(A)}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain records of the information used to verify a person's identity, including name, address, and other identifying information;&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(B)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to consult lists of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations provided to the financial institution by any government agency to determine whether a person seeking to open an account appears on any such list.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(2)(C)}}&lt;/ref&gt; When prescribing the regulations, the Secretary was ordered to take into account the types of accounts available to financial institutions, the various methods someone can use to open accounts, and the various types of identifying information available to the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]], banks and other financial institutions are restricted from carrying out activities that do not relate to financial activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sia.com/capitol_hill/html/bank_holding_company_act_of_19.html Bank Holding Company Act of 1956], ''SIA Primer on Securities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] Sec. 4(k) ({{usc-clause|12|1843|(k)}})&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases, the regulations must be prescribed jointly by the Secretary and each Federal functional regulator&lt;ref&gt;The section states that this includes regulators "defined in section 509 of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]], including the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]]"&lt;/ref&gt; appropriate for such financial institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(4)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary also has the power to exempt such institutions from the regulations proscribed under section 326.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|31|5318|(l)(5)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The section also required a report with 6 months of the enactment of the Patriot Act from the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with Federal functional regulators as defined in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. As such, on July 23, 2002 the Department of Treasury, FinCEN, the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency]] (OCC), the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Commission]] (FDIC), the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]] (OTS) and the [[National Credit Union Association]] (NCUA) jointly released a joint notice of rule-making in the [[Federal Register]] for banks,&lt;ref&gt;67 FR 48290&lt;/ref&gt; and Treasury simultaneously released an identical notice in the Federal Register for credit unions, private banks and trust companies who did not have a functional regulator.&lt;ref&gt;67 FR 48299&lt;/ref&gt; After a considerable response, alterations to the proposed rule making were made and Treasury and the Federal functional agencies released 31 CFR 103.121. The regulation sets out the minimum requirements for setting up a [[Customer Identification Program]] (CIP). These requirements for the CIP are that it must:
# be appropriate for the financial institution's size and type of business, and if it must have an anti-money laundering compliance program then the CIP must be part of this. Credit Unions, private banks and trust companies without a Federal functional regulator must have a CIP approved by their [[board of directors]],
# have identity verification procedures. These must include risk-based procedures that allow the bank to form a reasonable belief that it knows the identities of each customer. The regulation specifies what is required to identify a customer. If a customer does not provide sufficient information to allow their verification the CIP must include procedures the bank must undertake. The procedures must cover (1) circumstances when the bank cannot verify the customer's identity; (2) should cover circumstances when the bank should not open an account; (3) specify what terms in which a customer may use an account while the bank tries to verify the customer's identity; (4) when a bank should close an account after being unable to verify a customer's identity; and (5) when a bank should file a Suspicious Activity Report,
# have procedures for making and maintaining a record of all verification information gathered by the financial institution,
# have procedures for determining whether a customer appears on any government list of known or suspected terrorists or terrorist organizations - the bank must determine this within a "reasonable time",
# have procedures for giving adequate notice to customers that the bank is requesting information to verify their identities, and
# have procedures that specify when another financial institution will rely on another financial institution to perform any of the procedures set out in their CIP
The regulation allows any Federal regulator, in concurrence with the Secretary of Treasury, to exempt a bank or type of account from the regulations given.

==Sec. 327. Consideration of anti-money laundering record==
The [[Bank Holding Company Act of 1956]] makes it unlawful, except with prior approval of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for a bank to take any action that makes another company into a [[bank holding company]] or subsidiary of one; for a bank holding company to acquire direct or indirect shares of more than 5% of a bank; for bank holding companies to acquire all or most of the assets of a bank; and in most circumstances for a bank holding company to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|12|1842|(a)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 327 amends the Act to make the Board take into consideration the effectiveness of the company or companies in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph (6) was added to {{usc-clause|12|1842|(c)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Deposit Insurance Act]] prevents the merger of insured depository institutions with non-insured depository institutions without the written approval of a responsible agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc-clause|12|1828|(c)(1)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was amended by section 327 to take into consideration the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the proposed merger transaction in combatting money laundering activities, including in overseas branches, when approving such mergers.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph (11) was designated as paragraph (12) and the amendment was added as paragraph (11) to {{usc-clause|12|1828|(c)(1)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the amendments only apply to applications submitted to either the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or responsible agency after December 31, 2001, and which were not approved by the Board or responsible agency before the date of enactment of the Patriot Act.

==Sec. 328. International cooperation on identification of originators of wire transfers==
The Secretary of the Treasury must take all reasonable steps to encourage foreign governments to require the inclusion of the name of the originator in [[wire transfer]] instructions sent to the United States and other countries, with the information to remain with the transfer from its origination until the point of [[wikt:disburse|disbursement]]. They must also report annually to the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on the progress Treasury is making on this issue and what is impeding progress of implementing the wire transfer identification scheme.

==Sec. 329. Criminal penalties==
An official or employee of the government who acts corruptly — as well as the person who induces the corrupt act — by being influenced for any official act, who is influenced to allow or collude with any fraudulent act, or who is induced to take or not take some action which is in violation of the person's official duties will be fined by an amount that is not more than three times the monetary equivalent of the bribe in question. Alternatively they may be imprisoned for not more than 15 years, or they may be fined and imprisoned. All violations are subject to [http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode18/usc_sup_01_18_10_II_20_227.html chapter 227 of title 18, United States Code], and the provisions of the [[United States Sentencing Guidelines]].

==Sec. 330. International cooperation in investigations of money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of terrorist groups==
This section details that the sense of Congress is to encourage international cooperation in investigations of money laundering, financial crimes, and the finances of terrorist groups. The sense is that the [[U.S. President]] should direct the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, or the Secretary of the Treasury, as appropriate, and in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to seek to enter into negotiations with the appropriate financial supervisory agencies and other officials of any foreign country who do business with the U.S.. Congress's purpose is to ensure that foreign banks and other financial institutions maintain adequate records of transaction and account information relating to any foreign terrorist organization,&lt;ref&gt;As designated under [http://uscis.gov/lpBin/lpext.dll/inserts/slb/slb-1/slb-20/slb-4856?f=templates&amp;fn=document-frame.htm#slb-act219 section 219] of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|Immigration and Nationality Act]]&lt;/ref&gt; any person who is a member or representative of any such organization, or any person engaged in money laundering or financial or other crimes and establish a mechanism whereby, when appropriate, these records may be made available to United States law enforcement officials and domestic financial institution supervisors.

'''''Pirates of Silicon Valley''''' is an original 1999 American [[Made for television film|made for television]] [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]], directed by [[Martyn Burke]] and starring [[Noah Wyle]] as [[Steve Jobs]] and [[Anthony Michael Hall]] as [[Bill Gates]]. Spanning the years 1971–1997 and based on Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine's 1984 book ''Fire in the Valley: The Making of the Personal Computer, ''it explores the impact of the rivalry between Jobs ([[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]]) and Gates ([[Microsoft]]) on the development of the [[personal computer]].

== Plot ==
[[Steve Jobs]] ([[Noah Wyle]]) is speaking with director [[Ridley Scott]] (J. G. Hertzler), about the creation of the [[1984 (advertisement)|1984 commercial]] for [[Apple Computer#1981.E2.80.9385: Lisa and Macintosh|Apple Computer]], which introduced the first Macintosh. Jobs is trying to convey his idea that "We're creating a completely new consciousness." Scott is more concerned with the technical aspects of the commercial.

Next in 1997 with Jobs, [[History of Apple#1996: Return of Steve Jobs|returning to Apple]], and announcing [[History of Apple#Microsoft deal|a new deal with Microsoft]] at the [[Macworld Expo#1997|1997 Macworld Expo]]. His partner, [[Steve Wozniak]] or "WOZ" (Joey Slotnick), is introduced as one of the two central narrators of the story. Wozniak notes to the audience the resemblance between [[Big Brother (1984)|Big Brother]] and the image of [[Bill Gates]] (Anthony Michael Hall) on the screen behind Jobs during this announcement. Asking how they "got from there to here," the film turns to flashbacks of his youth with Jobs, prior to the forming of Apple.

The earliest flashback is in 1971 and takes place on the [[University of California, Berkeley|U.C. Berkeley]] campus during the period of the [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|student anti-war movements]]. Teenagers Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak are shown caught on the campus during a riot between students and police. They flee and after finding safety, Jobs states to Wozniak, "Those guys think they're revolutionaries. They're not revolutionaries, we are." Wozniak then comments that "Steve was never like you or me. He always saw things differently. Even when I was in Berkeley, I would see something and just see [[kilobytes]] or [[circuit boards]] while he'd see [[karma]] or the [[Meaning of life|meaning of the universe]]."

Using a similar structure, the film next turns to a young Bill Gates ([[Anthony Michael Hall]]) at [[Harvard University]], in the early 1970s, with classmate [[Steve Ballmer]] (John DiMaggio), and Gates’ high school friend [[Paul Allen]] (Josh Hopkins). As with Wozniak in the earlier segment, Ballmer narrates Gates' story, particularly the moment when Gates discovers the existence of [[Ed Roberts (computer engineer)|Ed Roberts]]'s [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems|MITS]] [[Altair 8800|Altair]] causing him to drop out of Harvard. Gates' and Allen's early work with MITS is juxtaposed against the involvement of Jobs and Wozniak with the "Homebrew Computer Club". Jobs and Woz develop [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] in the garage of Jobs' family home, with the help of [[Daniel Kottke|Daniel]] (Marcus Giamatti) and Elizabeth (Melissa McBride). Eventually [[Mike Markkula]] (Jeffrey Nordling) invests in the company which allows it to expand and move forward. In 1977, Jobs, Woz, and Markkula demo the [[Apple II]] at the [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. This event is followed by the development of the [[Influence of the IBM-PC on the PC market|IBM-PC]] with the help of Gates and [[Microsoft]] in 1981.

The film also follows Jobs' relationship with his high school girlfriend and early Apple employee, Arlene (a pseudonym for [[Chrisann Brennan]], portrayed by Gema Zamprogna), and the difficulties he had acknowledging the birth and existence of their daughter, [[Lisa Brennan-Jobs|Lisa]]. Around the time his daughter was born, Jobs unveiled his next computer, which he named, [[Apple Lisa|The Lisa]]. The Lisa was then followed in 1984 by the (Macintosh), a computer inspired by the [[Xerox Alto]]. The main body of the film finally concludes with a 30th birthday toast in 1985 to [[Steve Jobs]] shortly before [[History of Apple#1985: Jobs leaves Apple|he was fired]] by CEO [[John Sculley]] (Allan Royal), from Apple Inc.

The film ends in 1997, with 42 year old Jobs' return to Apple (after its acquisition of [[NeXT Computer]]) and with his announcement at the [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld Expo]] of an alliance between Apple and Microsoft. It also indicates that Jobs is now married, has children, and has reconciled with Lisa.

===Development===
Burke notes that when he was shown the first draft of the screenplay, which is based upon Freiberger and Swaine's ''Fire in the Valley,'' "It was all about how the ‘286 computer’ became the ‘386’ and so on ... I was bored by it."&lt;ref name=com&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the studio asked him for suggestions Burke states that "I’m a great believer in Shakespeare, and what we had was a modern equivalent of [[Hamlet]], featuring two young princes, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs ... the more I read about Steve in particular, the more I saw him in those Shakespearean terms. He was brilliant, volcanic, obsessive, suspicious, even vicious in a business sense. He was about conquest, always conquest. I said, ‘That’s the sort of movie I want to make."&lt;ref name=com/&gt; Burke was thus hired as director of the project and rewrote the screenplay.&lt;ref name=com/&gt; In developing the characters themselves, Burke also stated that he chose not to speak with any of the central figures portrayed in the film:

{{quote|I did not want to do an "authorized biography" on either Microsoft or Apple, so we made the decision going in that we would not talk or meet with them. With a team of Harvard researchers, I embarked on a seven-month research project that encompassed virtually everything we could find on the history of both companies, including old technical magazines from the '70s. I intended every scene to be based on actual events, including such seemingly fantastic moments as Bill Gates' bulldozer races in the middle of the night and Steve Jobs' bare feet going up on the board room table during an applicant's job interview. I have two or more sources that verify each scene.&lt;ref name=interview1 /&gt;}}

===Casting===
Burke sought [[Noah Wyle]] for the part of Jobs. Wyle originally turned down the role, but changed his mind after Burke had him watch the 1996 documentary, ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]''.&lt;ref name=bi2015/&gt; Wyle states that he watched the documentary "for ten seconds and knew I'd kick myself for the rest of my life if I didn't play this part."&lt;ref name=wyleofficial&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/steve.html |title=Noah Wyle as Steve Jobs |accessdate=2015-12-13 |last= |first= |date=1999 |publisher=Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011214000510/http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/steve.html |archivedate=December 14, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also noted that ''[[Triumph of the Nerds]]'' led him to be "taken by [Jobs'] presence, his confidence, smugness, smartness, ego, and his story's trajectory. He seemed to be the most Shakespearean figure in American culture in the last 50 years I could think of – the rise of, the fall of, and the return of. The truest definition of a tragic hero—but you get the 'bonus round' that [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] said didn't exist. Jobs has had one hell of a second act."&lt;ref name=bi2015/&gt; Burke later credited Wyle for the success of the film stating that, "whatever was in the air, [Wyle] just absorbed i ... he became Jobs. It was a remarkable transformation. We had a photo of Steve Jobs at about 28 years old, from the cover of Fortune magazine. We did a mockup with Noah and it was almost impossible to tell them apart."&lt;ref name=com/&gt; Burke also credits Joey Slotnick's interpretation of Steve Wozniak (who was so impressed that he flew to Los Angeles to have lunch with Slotnick) with Wozniak's enthusiasm for the film. He notes that, "Steve Wozniak made several speeches in which he said that the film accurately portrays how things actually happened," Burke says. "To me that was better than any awards or nominations the film could get."&lt;ref name=com/&gt;

[[Anthony Michael Hall]], who was cast as [[Bill Gates]], commented on his interest in the role, stating that he, "really fought for this part because I knew it would be the role of a lifetime ... it was a thrill and a daunting challenge to play someone of his stature and brilliance."&lt;ref name=amh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/bill.html |title=Anthony Michael Hall as Bill Gates |accessdate=2015-12-13 |last= |first= |date=1999 |publisher=Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011117170345/http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/bill.html |archivedate=November 17, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===

''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' was originally scheduled to be shot in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]], with over $1 million in sets. However, when Wyle was not able to receive a long enough release from [[ER (TV series)]] to shoot in Canada, the film temporarily shut down. Filming began again later in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=com/&gt; During the filming, the cast broke down into PC and Mac factions, arguing over the merits of each platform. Burke states that he began the film as a PC user and ended a Mac user.&lt;ref name=com/&gt;

==Themes==
One of the central thematic aspects of the screenplay is the representation of a young [[Steve Jobs]], who while participating in aspects of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]], interprets his role in it differently. Actor [[Noah Wyle]], who portrays Jobs, stated in an interview with [[CNN]], "These kids grew up 30 miles south of the (University of California) Berkeley campus, which was ripe with revolution [...] and they couldn't have cared less about the politics going on. They were in the garage tinkering with their electronics and starting a revolution that was a thousand times greater than anything that was going on the college campuses, politically."&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Martyn Burke]] also noted in an interview that, "Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are the true revolutionaries of our time. Not the students who occupied the dean’s office in the late ’60s. Not the anti-war marchers who were determined to overthrow the establishment. Jobs and Gates are the ones who changed the way the world thinks, acts and communicates."&lt;ref name=interview1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/martyn.html |title=Official website: Q&amp;a With Martyn Burke |accessdate=2015-12-13 |first= |last= |date=1999 |publisher=Official Website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020206092321/http://alt.tnt.tv/movies/tntoriginals/pirates/html/martyn.html |archivedate=February 6, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=The personalities were very accurately portrayed ... Incidents [in the film] are accurate in the sense that they all occurred but they are often with the wrong parties ([[Bill Fernandez]], Apple employee #4, was with me and the computer that burned up in 1970) and at the wrong dates (when [[John Sculley]] joined, he had to redirect attention from the [[Apple III]], not the [[Macintosh|Mac]], to the [[Apple II]]) and places ([[Homebrew Computer Club]] was at [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]]) ... The personal drives portrayed in the movie were amazingly accurate. So were the key personalities, but not some others ... Mike was portrayed in the movie in a very inaccurate and unfair way, making it look like he was financially shrewd. Actually, he was intellectually open and contributing and, more than anyone else, he ran and structured the company in the early days, while Steve floated around getting his feet wet at running a company and learning to be a top executive.|source=—[[Steve Wozniak]]&lt;ref name=wozorglet1&gt;{{cite web

===Historical accuracy===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=[The day before the 1999 [[Macworld Expo#1999|Macworld]], [[Steve Jobs]] went shopping and] bought me a matching pair of blue jeans and a black turtleneck sweater and matching round eyeglasses. He'd written a sketch for us to perform the next day at Macworld. I'd put my hands together in a kind of Jobs-like silent-prayer pose and then launch into his keynote. And then a few minutes into the address he'd come storming onto the stage and say, 'Wyle, you don't have me at all! What the hell are you doing? First I pick up my slide-clicker and then I put my hands together.' He'd say,'Ladies and gentlemen, Noah Wyle!; And then he'd kick me off the stage and take over, introducing the latest piece of Apple technology. And that's exactly how we did it. The first few rows, I think, could obviously tell it wasn't him, but most others didn't know at all. And there was this growing ripple of laughter throughout the auditorium when people got what was happening.I honestly had had no idea what to expect: I thought the whole thing might be an ambush—that he’d get me to his event and that what he said we were going to do in fact wasn’t what we were going to do, and I would somehow be humiliated.

[[Steve Jobs]], [[Bill Gates]], and [[Steve Wozniak]], all responded to the film.  Jobs' only public response occurred at the [[Macworld Expo#1999|1999 Macworld Expo]]. After ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' had aired, Jobs contacted [[Noah Wyle]] and told him that while he "hated" both the film and the screenplay, he liked Wyle's performance, noting "you do look like me."&lt;ref name="bi2015" /&gt; Jobs then invited Wyle to the 1999 [[Macworld Expo|Macworld convention]] to play a prank on the audience. Wyle agreed and initially appeared as Jobs, until Jobs walked onto the stage and let the audience in on the joke.&lt;ref name="bi2015" /&gt; In contrast, Jobs avoided meeting the director Martyn Burke, who later said that "Steve wanted nothing to do with me."&lt;ref name="com" /&gt;

In a 2013 ''Ask Me Anything'' session with [[Reddit]], Gates responded to a question about his portrayal in the film by stating that it was "reasonably accurate."&lt;ref name=Reddit&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also responded to a fan email, that part of his portrayal was inaccurate: "I never quit Apple. That suggestion was based on an incorrect Wall Street Journal that said I was leaving Apple because I didn't like things there. Actually, I had told the Wall Street Journal writer that I wasn't leaving Apple because of things that I didn't like and that I wasn't even leaving, keeping my small salary forever as a loyal employee. I just wanted a small startup experience and a chance to design a smaller product again, a universal remote control."&lt;ref name="wozorglet1" /&gt; In May 2015, Wozniak once again commented on the film, stating that  ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is an example of a good Hollywood dramatization of himself, [[Steve Jobs]], and the story of [[Apple Inc]].

Jobs' college friend and early Apple employee [[Daniel Kottke]] also liked the film. He noted in an interview that it was "a great movie. Noah Wyle was just uncannily close to Jobs. Just unbelievable. I found myself thinking it was actually Steve on the screen." He also states that in the film there were "all these scenes of the garage where it’s like half a dozen people working, busily carrying things back and forth, and oscilloscopes" when he [Kottke] "was really the only person who worked in the garage. Woz would show up once a week with his latest to test it out, and Steve Jobs was on the phone a lot in the kitchen."&lt;ref name="slashdot"&gt;{{cite news

Two individuals have responded to the film's interpretation of Jobs' 1979 visit to the [[Xerox PARC]] research center (which influenced the development of both ''The Lisa'' and ''The Mac''). PARC's director, [[John Seely Brown]] stated in a 2006 interview that the scene in which Gates and Jobs argue about the role of Xerox is not entirely accurate. He said that Jobs was invited by PARC to view their technology in exchange for the ability to buy pre-IPO Apple stock.&lt;ref name=jsb&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak also said (in response to a question about that scene from a fan (via email) that, "Apple worked with Xerox openly to bring their developments to a mass audience. That's what Steve portrayed Apple as being good at. Xerox got a lot of Apple stock for it too, it was an agreement. Microsoft just took it from Xerox or Apple or whomever. It took them a long time to get it halfway right."&lt;ref name=wozorglet2/&gt;

== History ==
In 2001, the Stockholm chapter of the Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation ({{lang-sv|SUF, Syndikalistiska Ungdomsförbundet}}) launched the campaign Planka.nu (literally, ''fare-dodge.now'') as a reaction to a rise in ticket prices by the [[Stockholm County Council]].&lt;ref name="planka-om"/&gt; The domain name [[.nu]], which belongs to the
{{convert|260|km²|adj=on}} island of [[Niue]] but is sold primarily to foreigners, was chosen because it means "now" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]. The standard [[top level domain]] for Sweden is [[.se]].
 
With growing membership and interest, the campaign was detached from the SUF to form an independent organization. Local organizations have since started up in [[Gothenburg]] in 2003, [[Östergötland]] in 2005 and [[Skåne]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=planka-om /&gt; A sister organization, ''pumm.it'' has been created in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]].&lt;ref name="pummit"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008, Planka.nu released [http://freepublictransports.com Freepublictransports.com], a global forum for the free public transport movement.  

Ticket fares in Stockholm have increased dramatically over time. By one measure&amp;mdash;single ticket price for a {{convert|10|km|adj=on}} journey&amp;mdash;Stockholm has the most expensive-to-use public transport in the world, as of March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14396066 |title=A fare price?| publisher=[[The Economist]]| date=September 24, 2009| accessdate=2009-09-24| quote=In Stockholm it costs $4.88 for a single journey of 10km on public transport, the highest cost in a study of 73 cities by [[UBS AG|UBS]], a Swiss bank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
{{see also|Free public transport#Criticism}}
Planka.nu and its organizers have seen substantial criticism, primarily by politicians and transportation companies in each city. The network has been reported to the police for [[incitement]] by [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]] (SL),&lt;ref name="dn-hermele"&gt;{{cite web

| quote       = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many critics believe that [[fare evasion]] leads to reduced funds and higher costs for public transport, which must be offset by higher prices for those who do pay their fares.&lt;ref name=gp-nystrom /&gt;&lt;ref name="dn-palmgren"&gt;{{citation

In 2004, the [[Stockholm University#Student unions|Stockholm University Student Union]] received media attention after first permitting a meeting of the network on its premises and later barring Planka.nu when criticism was voiced.&lt;ref name="dn-kihlstrom"&gt;{{cite web

'''Prince Abbas Hilmi bin [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] bin [[Abbas II of Egypt|Khedive Abbas Hilmi II Bey]]''' ({{Lang-ar|الأمير عباس حلمي بن الأمير محمد عبد المنعم بن الخديوي عباس حلمي باشا الثاني}}) (born 16 October 1941, [[Cairo]]) is an Egyptian and Imperial Ottoman prince and [[Financial adviser|financial manager]]. A member of the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty]] and the Imperial House of Osman, he is the only son of [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] and his [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman]] wife [[Fatma Neslişah|Princess Neslişah]], and grandson of [[Abbas II of Egypt|Khedive Abbas Hilmi II Bey]].

==Early life==
Born in Cairo in 1941, Prince Abbas Hilmi was named after his paternal grandfather [[Abbas II of Egypt|Abbas Hilmi II]], the last [[khedive]] of Egypt. Theirs was the most senior male branch descended from [[Isma'il Pasha]], and thus first in the line of succession to the Egyptian throne by virtue of the [[Imperial Firman of 27 May 1866|1866 rules of succession]]. However, those rules were suspended by the British upon their proclamation of a protectorate over Egypt in 1914. Abbas Hilmi II was deposed, and his son [[Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim|Muhammad Abdel Moneim]] lost his place as [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref name="Burke 35"&gt;[[#Mon80|Montgomery-Massingberd 1980]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Millfield p. 35]&lt;/ref&gt; The throne passed to Abbas Hilmi II's uncles [[Hussein Kamel of Egypt|Hussein Kamel]] and [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]]. The [[Royal Edict of 13 April 1922]] specifically excluded Abbas Hilmi II from the succession, although it stated that "this exception shall not apply to his sons and their progeny."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |authorlink=Younan Labib Rizk |date=10–16 February 2000 |title=The fallen dynasty |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |series=A Diwan of contemporary life, 324 |issue=468 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/468/chrncls.htm |accessdate=9 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720043015/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/468/chrncls.htm |archivedate=20 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim and his son Prince Abbas Hilmi remained eligible for the throne and retained a senior position in the [[order of precedence]] of the [[Kingdom of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Cabinet of the Grand Chamberlain of the Kingdom of Egypt |title=Protocole |year=1947 |publisher=National Printing House |location=Cairo |language=French |oclc=2482348 |page=22 |trans-chapter=Members of the Royal Family by their degree of proximity to His Majesty the King |chapter=[[:File:Protocole du Royaume d'Égypte, 1947 – Page 022.jpg|Membres de la Famille Royale dans l'ordre de leur parenté avec Sa Majesté le Roi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Abbas Hilmi's two great-grandfathers on his mother's side were [[Mehmed VI]], the last Ottoman sultan, and [[Abdülmecid II]], the last Ottoman caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ottomanfamily.com/family_tree.html |title=Ottoman Family Tree |publisher=Official website of the immediate living descendants of the Ottoman Dynasty |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420055333/http://www.ottomanfamily.com/family_tree.html |archivedate=20 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mon80|Montgomery-Massingberd 1980]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=bnsUAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Neslisah p. 247]&lt;/ref&gt; Had the Ottoman monarchy not been abolished in 1922, Prince Abbas Hilmi would have received, in addition to his Egyptian princely title ({{Lang-ar|أمير|translit=Amir}}), the [[Ottoman titles|Ottoman title]] of ''sultanzade'', which was given to the sons of imperial princesses.&lt;ref name="Sultanzades"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ottomanfamily.com/index.php?page=3 |title=Sultanzades |publisher=Official website of the immediate living descendants of the Ottoman Dynasty |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1952, the [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|Free Officers]] launched a revolution that led to the forced abdication of King [[Farouk of Egypt]] in favour of his infant son [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]]. Due to Fuad II's minority, Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim was chosen by the [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|new military rulers]] to serve as regent, first as head of a temporary [[Regencies in Egypt|regency body]] and later as sole [[prince regent]]. However, he did not last long in the position, as the Egyptian monarchy was officially abolished on 18 June 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Rizk |first=Yunan Labib |authorlink=Younan Labib Rizk |date=27 January – 2 February 2005 |title=Royal help |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |series=A Diwan of contemporary life, 578 |issue=  727 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2005/727/chrncls.htm |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Muhammad Abdel Moneim and his wife Neslişah were arrested in 1957 and accused of taking part in an anti-[[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=28 December 1957 |title=Egypt Investigates 'Anti-Nasser Plot' |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/12/28/archives/egypt-investigates-antinasser-plot.html |format=Fee required |quote=It said a relative of former King Farouk, Prince Abdel Moneim, and his socialite wife, Nazli Shaa, had been arrested in connection with the plot.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their souring relations with the new revolutionary regime forced them into exile. As a result, their son Prince Abbas Hilmi spent much of his life in England and France.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt;

==Business activities==
{{Egyptian Royal Family}}
Educated at [[Millfield]] school in [[Street, Somerset]], Prince Abbas Hilmi pursued his higher studies at [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Burke 35"/&gt; He worked for a [[Discount store|discount house]], a bank and an [[insurance broker]] before joining Grieveson Grant &amp; Co. in 1968.&lt;ref name="Bulletin"&gt;{{Cite journal |year=1971 |title=Nothing's really British any more |journal=[[The Bulletin]] |volume=93 |issue=4762–4774 |page=111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jecXAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Abbas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained with Grieveson Grant &amp; Co., one of the [[City of London|City]]'s top stockbrokers, until 1981. In 1970, he made history by becoming the first foreign member of the [[London Stock Exchange]],&lt;ref name="EIMA"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eima.org.eg/prince.asp |title=Prince Abbas Hilmi |publisher=Egyptian Investment Management Association |accessdate=9 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012162931/http://www.eima.org.eg/prince.asp |archivedate=12 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; his election having been rendered possible by a change of Rule 21, which had previously restricted membership to British citizens.&lt;ref name="Bulletin"/&gt; After leaving Grieveson Grant &amp; Co., Prince Abbas Hilmi became a general manager of Schroder Asseily &amp; Co. (1981–1983), and then Chairman of Hilmi and Associates (1983–1986), where he was mostly engaged in financial management activities and project finance assignments. After spending three years in London as Vice-President of [[Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.]] (1986–1989), he joined the Concord Group in 1989, only one year after its establishment.&lt;ref name="EIMA"/&gt; He was part of the three-member team that launched the Concord Group's Cairo office in 1994. Since then, Egypt has become the group's main focus area, with more than half of the assets it manages ($2.8&amp;nbsp;billion out of $3.4&amp;nbsp;billion) being invested in Egyptian [[Security (finance)|securities]]. Concord is currently among the largest [[Investment management|asset management]] firms in Egypt. One of the funds it manages, the Egypt Investment Company Ltd, has been repeatedly ranked by the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' as the top performing fund in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Salah-Ahmed |first=Amira |date=13 August 2008 |title=One on One: Concord Carves Niche in Egypt's Capital Market |journal=[[Daily News Egypt]] |url=http://www.dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=15717 |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Abbas Hilmi still works for Concord, where he holds the position of Senior Managing Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.concordus.com/bios/ahilmi.html |title=Prince Abbas Hilmi |publisher=Concord International Investments Group |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural activities==
Since his return to Egypt in 1994, Prince Abbas Hilmi has devoted considerable time to the conservation of his family's architectural legacy. He was instrumental in providing the funds necessary for the 2004–2008 renovation of his great-grandfather [[Tewfik Pasha]]'s mausoleum, where he has reserved a burial plot for himself.&lt;ref name="Stanford"/&gt; In 2006, he founded the Friends of Manial Palace Museum Association, which seeks to preserve the [[Manial Palace and Museum|palace]] of his granduncle [[Mohammed Ali Tewfik|Prince Muhammad Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=28 June – 4 July 2007 |title=A princely estate |journal=[[Al-Ahram Weekly]] |issue=851 |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2007/851/sc15.htm |accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and children==
In 1969, Prince Abbas Hilmi married Mediha Momtaz (born 1945). The religious ceremony was performed in [[Istanbul]] on 1 June, and the civil marriage took place at the [[Kensington]] [[Register Office]] in London on 20 June. Mediha is a maternal granddaughter of Ahmad Midhat Abbas Yeghen, a descendant of one of the sisters of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]], the founder of the Egyptian royal family.&lt;ref name="Burke 35"/&gt; Prince Abbas Hilmi and his wife Mediha are thus genealogically related, as illustrated by the family tree below. The couple have a daughter, Sabiha Fatma (born 1974), and a son, Daoud Abdel Moneim (born 1979).&lt;ref name="Sultanzades"/&gt; As of 2005, Prince Abbas Hilmi's only sister Ikbal (born 1944) lived in Istanbul with their mother [[Fatma Neslişah|Neslişah]] (1921–2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.egy.com/historica/egyptianconsorts.shtml |title=Egypt's First Ladies |first=Samir |last=Raafat |date=March 2005 |publisher=Egy.com |accessdate=7 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922021026/http://egy.com/historica/egyptianconsorts.shtml |archivedate=22 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Scotoni''' (1901-1955) was a Swiss [[businessman]] notable for his involvement in the [[Cinema of Germany|German film industry]]. He was the son of [[Eugen Scotoni]]. Between 1930 and 1935, when it was [[nationalisation|nationalised]] by the German government, he oversaw his family's interest in [[Terra Film]] - the second most important German production company behind [[Universum Film AG|UFA]]. Scotoni automatically became a member of the Nazi Party (as was common for owners of large companies) but never picked up his membership card. Many of his later films depicted similarities between [[Switzerland]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. He left Germany in 1935 after the nationalization of Terra.

'''SANZAAR''' (South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina Rugby) is the body which operates [[Super Rugby]] and [[The Rugby Championship]] competitions in [[Rugby Union]]. SANZAAR meets annually and is composed of the CEOs from its member unions.

It was formed as SANZAR in 1996 as a joint venture of the [[South African Rugby Union]], the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]] and the [[Australian Rugby Union]]. From the 2016 season, its name was changed to SANZAAR following the inclusion of the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] as a full member of the organisation.&lt;ref name="SANZAR changes name to SANZAAR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/sanzar-changes-name-to-sanzaar-20160202 | title=SANZAR changes name to SANZAAR | work=Sport24 | date=2 February 2016 | accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{toc level|3}}

== History ==
=== Tri-Nations and Super 12: 1996 ===
[[File:SANZAR logo old.svg|150px|thumb|left|{{nowrap|SANZAR logo up to 2015.}}]]

SANZAR was formed in 1995, shortly after rugby's move to professionalism, to counter the threat of Australia's [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], a new [[rugby league]] competition that offered large salaries to players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howitt|first=Bob |year=2005| title=SANZAR Saga: Ten Years of Super 12 and Tri-Nations Rugby| publisher=Harper Collins Publishers |ISBN=1-86950-566-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SANZAR proposed the [[Super Rugby|Super 12]], an annual provincial competition with teams from all three countries, and the [[The Rugby Championship|Tri Nations Series]], an annual competition between each country's Test teams. This concept was developed by [[Queensland Rugby Union]] [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] Terry Doyle, [[New South Wales Rugby Union]] CEO [[David Moffett]] and [[Australian Rugby Union]] CEO Bruce Hayman.&lt;ref name = smh-2002/&gt; [[Rian Oberholzer]] was the first CEO of SANZAR.

SANZAR's proposals were under serious threat from the World Rugby Corporation (WRC), a company formed by lawyer Geoff Levy and former Wallaby player Ross Turnbull. Both wanted a professional worldwide rugby competition funded by [[Kerry Packer]], who had already developed professional cricket. At one point the WRC had a majority of the All Blacks and Wallaby teams signed up to their competition. However, the South African Rugby Union told the Springboks players that they would never play for their country again if they committed to the WRC, and they remained with the SARU. Most of the All Blacks then followed them, and finally the Wallabies did too.

To fund the competitions, SANZAR looked to [[News Limited]], who was the Super League's broadcaster, eventually being offered $555 million over 10 years for worldwide television rights.

=== Expansion to Super 14 ===

In 2002, a proposal to expand the Super 12 to fourteen teams, supported by Australia and South Africa, was vetoed by the [[New Zealand Rugby Union]].&lt;ref name = espn-19-02-2002/&gt; This led to calls for the Australian and South African teams to withdraw from the competition,&lt;ref name = espn-19-02-2002/&gt;&lt;ref name = espn-21-02-2002/&gt; but the partnership continued and the issue was revisited before the end of the original 10-year broadcasting deal.

For the 2006 season, SANZAR agreed to expand the Super 12 competition with two new teams and to increase the number of Test matches played in the Tri-Nations.&lt;ref name = espn-6-9-2004/&gt; Licences were granted for franchises based in Bloemfontein and Perth,&lt;ref name= cheetahs/&gt;&lt;ref name = espn-10-12-2004/&gt; creating the [[Cheetahs (rugby union)|Cheetahs]] and [[Western Force]] teams for the expanded Super 14 competition.

The SANZAR partnership was tested in 2007 after New Zealand removed its top 22 players from the Super 14 competition,&lt;ref name = smh-2007/&gt; and South Africa's removal of players from the Tri-Nations prompted calls for the [[Australian Rugby Union]] to cancel future matches against the Springboks.&lt;ref name = aus-2007/&gt;

==== Potential South African departure ====
In 2009 there emerged concerns that [[South African Rugby Union]] might opt to break away from the alliance over a dispute about the proposed plan to expand [[Super Rugby]] to fifteen teams in 2011, voicing its support for the concept generally but disagreeing over its length and format.  On 6 May 2009, however, ARU Chief Executive [[John O'Neill (sport administrator)|John O'Neill]] warned that the South Africans would be the real losers, missing out altogether and potentially losing players if they went ahead with the split. "The joint venture must remain intact", he urged. "I have dealt with the South Africans for years in [[business]] and [[sport]].  Part of their [[DNA]] is to take it to the brink.  There's a moment when they will realise they have taken it far enough."&lt;ref name= reuters-2009/&gt; On 20 May 2009, SANZAR announced it had reached agreement on a new deal involving all three nations beginning in the 2011 season.&lt;ref name= deal-2009/&gt;

=== The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby: 2011 ===
The deal for 2011 to 2015 included:&lt;ref name= deal-2009/&gt;
* Super Rugby expanded to 15 teams, and split into three conferences, each with five teams and based in one of the three nations. The four current Australian teams would be joined by a new team in the Australia conference; this license was later awarded to the [[Melbourne Rebels]].
* At the same time, the regular season expanded to include 16 matches (8 home, 8 away) per team, with each country playing a double round-robin within its home conference, and playing single matches against four teams from each of the other conferences.
* Super Rugby taking three weeks off in June for the mid-year Tests.
* The play-offs expanded to six teams, with the conference winners joined by the three non-winners with the most competition points without regard to conference affiliation. The two conference winners with the most competition points received a first-round bye in the play-offs.
* [[The Rugby Championship]] opening each year in South Africa, and concluding with the two of the three [[Bledisloe Cup]] matches between Australia and New Zealand that fall within the Rugby Championship. This allowed Springboks to be released early for their domestic competition, the [[Currie Cup]].

=== Super Rugby to Argentina and Japan: 2016 ===
Further expansion was agreed in 2015 to include the [[Argentine Rugby Union]] as a full member of SANZAAR from 2016.&lt;ref name = nyt-2015/&gt; Three additional teams were included in the Super Rugby competition, one each from South Africa, Argentina and Japan. Two regional groupings were formed: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference a four-team Africa 2 Conference.&lt;ref name="Outline of the Super Rugby competition structure"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://files.allblacks.com/comms/new-era-super-rugby/Outline-%20Super-Rugby-Comp-Structure-infographic.pdf | title=Outline of the Super Rugby competition structure | publisher=All Blacks | date=1 May 2014 | accessdate=1 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a Japanese team has been invited to participate in the [[Super Rugby]] competition from 2016, Japan is not a member of SANZAAR at this stage.

'''Sean Patrick Ewing''' (age 51) is an Irish entrepreneur involved in the fund management and yachting industries. He established [[FundsDirect]] in 1999 and co-founded [[Absolute Capital Management]] in 2004. In 2009 he acquired a majority stake in Pinmar, the world's largest yacht painting company, from the [[Ferretti Group]]. His wealth has been estimated at '''[[Euro sign|€]]'''95m and he has featured on the ''[[Irish Independent]]'s'' Irish Rich List since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/irelands-rich-list-251275-26645366.html|title=Ireland's Rich List: 251–275 – Independent.ie|newspaper=The Irish Independent|access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/rich-list-2015/profiles/sean-ewing-31046194.html|title=Sean Ewing – Independent.ie|newspaper=The Irish Independent|access-date=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Ewing, a native of [[Donegal]], was born the Irish seaport of Sligo in 1965 and attended [[Summerhill College]]. On leaving school, Ewing worked for his uncle's small engineering business in Letterkenny while studying accountancy at the [[Ulster University|University of Ulster]]. He was invited to run the investment arm of an Irish building society, developing its tax planning, financial planning and portfolio management services. This led to an opportunity to partner with Hichens, Harrison &amp; Co, the oldest firm of stockbrokers in the [[City of London Corporation|City of London]], to acquire IPS Capital Management, the Bristol-based fund management business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/interview-of-the-week-real-life-jr-is-a-mover-and-shaker-in-hedge-fund-world-26295741.html|title=Interview of the Week: Real life 'JR' is a mover and shaker in hedge fund world – Independent.ie|newspaper=The Irish Independent|access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fund Management ==
IPS Capital Management was reversed into Farlake, a property company listed on [[AIM market|London Stock Exchange's AIM market]]. Following the reversal, Farlake was repositioned as an asset management company which grew to $1bn assets under management before being sold to Talisman Group in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.investegate.co.uk/article.aspx?id=200002280701522739G|title=FE Investegate {{!}}Farlake Group PLC Announcements {{!}} Farlake Group PLC: Recommended Offer by Talisman House|website=www.investegate.co.uk|access-date=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ewing carved out from that sale the fund trading business which he had launched in 1999, called FundsDirect, the UK's first online fund supermarket. The platform allowed banks to trade around 36,000 funds across 13 European countries.

In 2004, Ewing co-founded Absolute Capital Management and listed 30% of the company on [[Alternative Investment Market|AIM]] in 2005.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10646">A '''protected slot limit''' is a tool used by [[Fishery|fisheries]] managers to regulate the size of [[fish]] that can legally be harvested from particular bodies of water.  Usually set by state fish and game departments, the protected [[Slot limits|slot limit]] prohibits the harvest of fish where the [[fish measurement|lengths, measured]] from the [[snout]] to the end of the tail, fall within the protected interval.&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.  “Minnesota Fishing Regulations 2011.”  2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, on a body of water where there is a protected slot limit on [[largemouth bass]] between 12 and 16&amp;nbsp;inches, largemouth between 12&amp;nbsp;inches and 16&amp;nbsp;inches may not be harvested.&lt;ref&gt;“Connecticut’s Bass Management Lakes”.  PDF. Accessed 9/25/2011.  URL:  http://www.cr.gov/dep/lib/dep/fishing/freshwater/bassbroc.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this example largemouth bass less than 12&amp;nbsp;inches and greater than 16&amp;nbsp;inches may be removed from the water and kept for personal use in accordance with local [[fishing]] regulations.

'''Slot limits''' are based on the principle that bass populations exhibit different habitat requirements during different phases of their life histories. Slot limits focus on protecting one segment of the life history which can influence overall fishing success.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lsu.edu/seagrantfish/resources/factsheets/largemouthbass.htm |title=Louisiana Fisheries - Fact Sheets |publisher=Lsu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[minimum landing size]] is a similar regulation in other areas.

==Purpose==
Generally, the purpose behind the implementation of protected slot limits is to improve the [[angling]] opportunities in a particular body or bodies of water.  Protected slot limits are most often used to regulate the harvest from waters where natural reproduction of the concerned fish species occurs.  The protected slot limit is set in such a way that it protects the size of those fish deemed most important to the species [[Spawn (biology)|spawning]] success in that fishery.  With the size of the most sexually productive fish protected from harvest it is likely that an increased number will spawn during a given year and hence lead to more naturally produced individuals.  The effort to increase the number of fish through natural reproduction mitigates the need for artificial stocking of a species to provide for a viable recreational fishery.

In addition to improving natural reproduction success the protected slot limit can also serve to improve the average catchable size of a [[protected species]].  This is of particular concern in recreational fisheries where the practice of [[catch and release]] is not prevalent.  The slot limit protects those fish that evade harvest until their size exceeds that of the lower end of the protected slot.  They are then protected from harvest until they exceed the maximum size within the protected slot.  Fish within this size range are protected from harvest during the time when their size would make them desirable by anglers.  In such a scenario the protection of large numbers of medium-sized fish translates into a higher success rate of those that exceed the slot limit.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Rodney.  Tomcko, Cynthia.  “Initial Effects of Slot Length Limits for Northern Pike in Five North-Central Minnesota Lakes.”  1997.  Online report.  PDF.  Accessed 9/25/2011.  URL:   http://files.dnr.state.mn.us/publications/fisheries/investigational_reports/454.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, the protected slot limit increases the amount of fish that reach the large sizes sought by [[Sport fishing|sport anglers]].  Of course, this model assumes that the lake or stream in question contains a forage base suitable to support fish of this size.

==Challenges==
The issue of protected slot limits, in some cases, is marked in controversy.  The protected slot limit and the angler’s desire to harvest fish can be in conflict.  The main challenge lies in the economic, ecological, and social factors that fisheries managers must consider when implementing harvest regulations such as protected slot limits.  Take, for example, the situation involving [[Lake Mille Lacs]] in central [[Minnesota]].  Anglers spend millions of dollars and travel countless miles to fish for Lake Mille Lacs [[walleye]] (Sander vitreus) which is highly sought after for its table fare as well as its sporting qualities.  In the case of Lake Mille Lacs there has long been a protected slot limit for walleye. In 2002, the slot limit was from 20&amp;nbsp;inches to 28&amp;nbsp;inches.  At the time, state fishing regulations stated that on Lake Mille Lacs an angler could keep 4 walleyes with only 1 walleye over 28&amp;nbsp;inches allowed, and all walleyes within the protected slot limit of 20 to 28&amp;nbsp;inches must be immediately released.  The protected slot limit worked so well, in a sense, that anglers soon found it difficult to catch harvestable sizes of walleye and they were catching an overabundance of slot-sized fish.  Many anglers have become frustrated by the lack of “eater” sized walleye. The intense protection of this size class of fish caused a sharp decline in the natural available forage base for walleyes.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, Dick.  “The Mille Lacs Fish Management Plan:  Threat to Minnesota’s Premier Walleye Fishery”.  2002.  PDF.  Accessed 9/25/2011.  URL:  http://www.perm.org/pdfs/TreatyManagement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The result was a large number of unhealthy and underweight slot sized walleyes in the fishery.  This case does represent an exception to the outcomes common to the implementation of protected slot limits.  However, it does illustrate the objectives fisheries managers must consider when devising protected slot limits.  Managers must balance the health of the fishery, trophy fish potential, and desired angler harvest.

==Ways to protect fish populations==
When an [[angling|angler]] is [[fishing]], he or she must measure the fish caught to make sure it meets the state's wildlife and fisheries requirements. Every state has their own limits for fish that are native to their ecosystems. If the fish meets the requirements then the angler is allowed to keep the fish, but can only keep a certain amount of fish of that species. Besides a slot limit there are other ways and limits that officials can use to protect a fish population.

#Minimum size limits- important when higher levels of reproduction are required.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;
#Creel Limits- used to prevent the harvest of too many fish at once, allowing more fish to reach larger sizes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; [[Guist Creek Lake]] is an example of a lake that has decided that a creel limit was necessary for there native fish species.
#Closed Seasons- used to help protect fish during their [[spawning]] seasons. If a given area puts a closed season into action an angler is not allowed to fish this area during specified times of the year.

==Mode of action==
[[File:Large Mouth Bass growth.pdf|thumb|As a largemouth bass grows they must reach a certain size to enter the reproductive stage. These fish reproduce with more frequency during a certain age and weight in their lifespan.]]
[[File:Largemouth Bass Slot Limit Diagram.pdf|thumb|The desired slot limit for largemouth bass]]

Before a slot limit can be put into action, four things must be taken into consideration in order to make sure no harm is done to the ecosystem:

===Growth rate===
Growth rate can be defined as how long it takes for a fish to reach a given size. Even though growth rate differs from lake to lake, an average [[largemouth bass]] can grow up to 3 pounds in less than three years, which is considered rapid growth.&lt;ref name="bassresource1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bassresource.com/fish_biology/selective_harvest.html |title=Managing Bass Fisheries with Size Limits &amp;#124; The Ultimate Bass Fishing Resource Guide LLC |publisher=Bassresource.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recruitment===
[[Recruitment]] is defined as the number of young fish that live to adulthood. Lakes with 20 to 40% coverage of aquatic plants usually have high bass recruitment, whereas lakes with little shoreline cover often have low to intermediate recruitment.&lt;ref name="bassresource1"/&gt;
If a lake has a high recruitment, this is a good situation for a state to use the slot limit because it will help control the number of small fish in a population. When the recruitment is low, this is where a state would use the minimum-size limit to control the fish population.&lt;ref name="bassresource1"/&gt;

===Mortality===
[[Mortality rate]] is the percent of fish in a given lake that die. To find the true mortality rate of a lake, officials must divide the number of fish harvested plus fish killed from hooks, then divide that number by the number of fish that die each year.

===Finally===
After the growth rate, recruitment rate, and mortality rate have been determined, if all three factors are met, the correct measurements must be chosen to insure that no harm is done to the surrounding ecosystem. If a slot limit is used correctly, not only will the a fish population benefit from this; but the surrounding ecosystem potentially could gain some benefits from a slot limit.

==Benefits==
Slot limits can be very beneficial to fish species along with their ecosystem. One benefit from slot limits is that it reduces the amount of competitive pressure between fish the same size. Not only will it reduce competition, but it will also result in a healthier fish population since the slot limit doesn't allow anglers to keep fish that produce the most eggs during their spawning season. Since the fish are healthier and larger, this will bring more jobs and tourists to a town, which will result in the city's revenue to rise.

==Example of a slot limit==
The [[Lake Fork Reservoir]] in Texas is known for its [[largemouth bass]]. A slot limit was introduced in the early 1900s in hopes of bettering the chances of catching a trophy bass. The regulations are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richie White |url=http://www.bassfishing.org/LakeFork-BagLimits.htm |title=Lake Fork Bag Limits |publisher=Bassfishing.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Largemouth bass are subject to a 16- to 24-inch slot limit.
# Bass 16 inches and shorter and 24 inches and longer can be harvest.
# daily bag limit of 5 fish
# 1 fish can be 24 inches or greater.

'''Brewers Retail Inc.''', [[trade name|doing business as]] '''The Beer Store''',  is a Canadian privately owned chain of retail outlets selling [[beer]] and other [[malt beverage]]s in the province of [[Ontario]], [[Canada]]. Founded in 1927, it was owned at its inception by a consortium of Ontario-based brewers. It currently operates as a unique open retail and wholesale system primarily owned by 3 large multinational brewing companies. It is also partially owned (under 0.02%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=THE BEER STORE OPERATIONS REPORT 2017 |url=http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Operational%20Report/OpsReport2017-Final-secured.pdf |website=The Beer Store |accessdate=27 October 2018 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;) by 30 Ontario-based brewers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us "The Beer Store"&lt;/ref&gt; Under the ownership model, all qualified brewers are free to list their products without discrimination and to set their own selling prices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fin.gov.on.ca/en/consultations/beer/agreement-exhibitD.html#ar2 "Master Framework Agreement"] Ontario Ministry of Finance&lt;/ref&gt; subject to LCBO price approval that must comply with legislated minimum and uniform pricing requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Greg (February 10, 2014) [www.thebeerstore.ca/.../default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf "TBS Alcohol Deregulation"], retrieved May 02, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Ontario's Liquor Control Act, The Beer Store was formerly the only retailer permitted to sell beer for off-site consumption, other than stores on the site of a brewery, locations of the provincial government-owned [[Liquor Control Board of Ontario]] (LCBO), and LCBO-authorized agency stores in certain smaller communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/html/statutes/english/elaws_statutes_90l18_e.htm|title=Liquor Control Act (R.S.O. 1990, c. L.18)|publisher=ServiceOntario ([[Government of Ontario]])|accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act and the company's articles of incorporation further stipulate that Brewers Retail cannot sell "hard liquor" (spirits) or consumer goods (like groceries).

Amendments made to the Liquor Control Act have since allowed for the sale of single and 6 packs of beer at select [[supermarket]]s in Ontario. That was done to enhance customer access and convenience. The Beer Store, however, continues to maintain pricing exclusivity in providing consumers discounts on larger packs of beer, along with retail partners, agency stores, combination stores and manufacturer outlets. What distinguishes the Beer Store is its characterization as a sort of "beer commons."&lt;ref name="Flanagan, Greg 2014"&gt;Flanagan, Greg.

==Company==
[[File:The Beer Store.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Beer Store shop.]]

The Beer Store follows an open ownership model whereby any qualifying brewer is allowed the opportunity to become a Beer Store shareholder. Currently, the Beer Store is owned by a consortium of 30 Ontario based brewers. In order to qualify, the brewer must operate at least one facility in Ontario, conduct the full brewing process and sell beer through the corporation. Valid Ontario and Canadian manufacturing licenses are required and the brewer must not produce beer in any other jurisdiction, or else meet minimum annual capacity and production goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Corporate%20Policies/Governance/Master%20Framework%20Agreement.pdf Master Framework Agreement (September 22, 2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store is governed by the Liquor Control Act (LCA) and is therefore regulated by the LCBO.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90l18 Liquor Control Act, RSO 1990, c.L.18]&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2016, the company operates over 450 retail stores which sell beer to the general public. This makes The Beer Store (TBS) the largest distributor of domestic beer in Ontario, selling to over 20,723 licensed customers. Although many imported beers are available at the Beer Store, the LCBO serves as the primary importer. Once imported, the product is then sold to the Beer Store for further distribution. As the primary retailer of Ontario, The Beer Store sells more than 720 brands of beer and over 1,000 home consumer beer selling units from 180 different brewers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/did-you-know The Beer Store (August 16, 2017)]&lt;/ref&gt; Larger Beer Store outlets typically stock around 600 beer selling units with the smallest Beer Stores stocking around 200 units.

TBS has a policy of accepting any brewer in the world to sell its product, as long as the brewer meets the requirements set by the LCBO.&lt;ref name="officialhist"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/tbs-history.html
 | title = A proud history in Ontario
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, unlike many other retailers, a brewer is given flexibility with regards to how many and which stores it would like to sell its product in.&lt;ref name="officialhist" /&gt; Because The Beer Store operates on a cost-recovery basis, listing fees for smaller breweries can be kept at a minimum. In 2016 TBS implemented a new lower tier rate for qualifying small brewers that is significantly less than the basic service rate paid by the larger brewing companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/Corporate%20Policies/Governance/Unanimous%20Shareholders%20Agreement%20of%20TBS%282%29.pdf Shareholders Agreement: Brewers Retail Inc. (January 1st, 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller breweries who produce under 1,000,000 hectoliters a year of beer qualify for this lower tier rate on their first 50,000 hectoliters of beer produced that year.  Additionally, qualifying small brewers who produce under 10,000 hectoliters a year are now provided with 2 free guaranteed product listings at 7 of their most proximate Beer Stores.

Currently, workers are represented by the [[United Food and Commercial Workers]] (UFCW) Local 12R24 union.

==History==
The company began in 1927, with the end of prohibition in Ontario. Although prohibition had proven to be unsuccessful, the provincial government still needed to placate angry temperance advocates and agreed that beer would be sold through a single network of stores. However, the government did not want to operate this network itself (as was done in some other Canadian provinces), and so permitted brewers to organize the Brewers Warehousing Company Ltd., which later became Brewers Retail/The Beer Store.

===Operating Model &amp; Pricing Market===
The Beer Store operates on a self-sustaining basis as an efficient distributor and retailer of Beer in the Province of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/ownership-governance/corporate-policy-financial-information TBS Financial Statements]&lt;/ref&gt; Operations take place on a fee for service basis, requiring brewers to pay a fee to sell their products through the Beer Store. The Beer Store publishes an annual rate sheet outlining their necessary financial requirements and consistency with annual budget and business plans.

The open nature of the Beer Store combined with pricing freedom for individual brewers is claimed to have created a highly competitive beer pricing market. The Beer Store processes hundreds of price changes every month and the average retail selling price in the system has only increased 2.8% from 2003 to 2014 while the general rate of Ontario inflation over the same period was approximately 20%.&lt;ref name="Flanagan, Greg 2014"/&gt; Ontario’s uniform pricing regulation precludes price competition between beer retailers such as the LCBO and the Beer Store. Price competition between individual brewers and brands within the Beer Store system is claimed to be significant, but there is little real competition as there is little variance in price both over time and between brands of similar quality. The system does benefit remote areas in that lower priced products are not restricted to larger outlets in urban centers, but are available at all Beer Store locations throughout the province. Hence rural consumers benefit as much (or as little) as urban consumers.

===Estimated profits===
The Beer Store states it operates as a not-for-profit entity.  While this may be true, critics have argued that the TBS system is structured to support relatively high prices and profits of the breweries and the detriment of consumers.  A series of studies, authored or co-authored by professor Anindya Sen of the University of Waterloo, estimated that the near-monopoly the Beer Store has in Ontario allows its owners to capture between $450 to $630 in “additional profits” each year.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya [http://economics.uwaterloo.ca/sites/economics.uwaterloo.ca/files/fac_files/Economic%20Analysis%20of%20Retail%20Liquor%20Sales%20in%20Ontario%20-%20Part%20I%20-%20June%2017.pdf "An Economic Analysis of Increasing Competition in Retail Liquor Sales in Ontario: Part I of a Two-Part Study for the Ontario Convenience Store Association", June 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya [http://www.c-storecanada.com/attachments/article/96/An%20Empirical%20Analysis%20of%20Beer%20Price%20Differentials%20Between%20Ontario%20and%20Quebe~.pdf "An Empirical Analysis of Beer Price Differentials Between Ontario and Quebec: Part II of a Two-Part Study Conducted for the Ontario Convenience Store Association", August 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Anindya and Masson, Paul R., [https://www.cdhowe.org/sites/default/files/attachments/research_papers/mixed/Commentary_414.pdf, "Uncorking a Strange Brew: The Need for More Competition in Ontario's Alcoholic Beverage Retail System", C.D. Howe Institute Commentary No 414, August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;   

The first of the Sen studies was commissioned by the Ontario Convenience Store Association and surveyed six 24-pack domestic brands from IGA and Metro Quebec flyers compared to the same brands at The Beer Store in Ontario over a 22 week period in 2013.   Sen corrected tax analysis associated with the original study and added three import brands from a Costco in Quebec in subsequent analysis.   Correcting for tax differentials between the two provinces, positive price differences of $1.3 - $3.3 were found to exist between their average price of 24-bottle packs of brands including Molson Canadian, Molson Dry, Coors Light, Budweiser and Bud Light. Using Molson Canadian as an example, the adjusted 24 pack price from Quebec IGA and Metro flyers was found to be $26.81 versus $28.12 for Ontario TBS locations.[16]&lt;ref&gt; Earnscliffe Strategy Group [http://saintjohnswort.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Comparing-Beer-Prices-Final.pdf, "Comparing Beer Prices Between Ontario and Quebec: Comments on the Ontario Convenience Store Association Study", November 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Sen’s analysis, The Beer Store commissioned a survey of Quebec – Ontario beer pricing by Debra Aron, an economist with Navigant Economics, which reviewed average TBS home consumer beer prices for all of 2013 in comparison to all beer sales at Quebec seven largest grocery chains, utilizing Neilsen data, for the same period.  Aron’s study concluded that the average TBS beer prices, excluding all taxes, were 18% less than those at Quebec grocery stores in 2013 or on a per case basis approximately $4.40 less per case of 24 cans.&lt;ref&gt; Aron, Debra J., [https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/report-prices-at-the-beer-store-lower-than-in-quebec-despite-higher-taxes-515330171.html, "The Price of Beer in Ontario and Quebec", May, 2014, Navigant Economics]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green policies===
Since 1927, the Beer Store has refunded deposits on all empty beer containers purchased in Ontario. In February 2007 the [[Ontario Deposit Return Program]] (ODRP) was launched by the Government of Ontario. The ODRP’s goal is to ensure that 100 per cent of all packaging sold at the LCBO follows the same path of all packaging sold at the Beer Store, to be reused or recycled.&lt;ref name="officialeng"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/environmental-leadership
 | title = An Environmental Leader
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All alcoholic beverage containers (over 100ml) purchased in Ontario are accepted for deposit return at any Beer Store location that returns empty containers. ODRP continues to make a meaningful contribution to Ontario’s waste diversion objectives, with the return rate increasing more than 16 percentage points since its first year of operation in 2007. Between the ODRP and Blue Box, an estimated 63,909 additional tonnes of glass is being diverted from Ontario landfills. These materials continue to be directed toward higher-end recycling supporting Ontario’s green economy and generating environmental benefits. “This success means we have recycling factories making new products, instead of higher piles of waste in landfills,” said Jim Bradley, Ontario Minister of the Environment, in an April 2014 statement.&lt;ref name="thebeerstore.ca"&gt;{{cite web| date=August 2014| title=Investing in Ontario’s Common Future: Beer Store Responsible Stewardship 2013 - 2014| url=http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/widget/right/2014%20Stewardship%20Report%20Web_0.pdf| format=PDF| publisher=Brewers Retail, Inc.| accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the ODRP, Ontario is now the principal source of quality glass cullet for Ontario glass manufacturing – previously Ontario glass manufacturers had to source glass cullet from other jurisdictions to support production. In 2013-2014, the Beer Store and ODRP program combined, avoided 196,332 tonnes of GHG emissions - equivalent to taking over 41,333 cars and trucks off Ontario roads.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/cleanenergy/energyresources/ calculator.html#results&lt;/ref&gt; Combined, these programs avoided over 2,694,461 gigajoules of energy - equivalent to over $41 million of oil (Note ($94.73/barrel and 6.1 GJ/barrel of oil).

Between 2013-2014, the Beer Store achieved a system-wide recovery and re-use rate of 99 per cent for the industry standard bottles, which are reused 12 to 15 times.&lt;ref name="thebeerstore.ca"/&gt; The Beer Store has received praise from local and national organizations including the [[Conservation Council of Ontario]], [[Environmental Defence Canada]], [[The Recycling Council of Ontario]], and [[Toronto Environmental Alliance]].&lt;ref name="officialenvqt"&gt;{{cite web
 | title = What Others are Saying
 | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/about-us/environmental-leadership/what-others-are-saying
 | publisher = The Beer Store
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TBS’ recycling efforts translate into cost savings for municipal governments as municipalities need not spend tax revenue on recycling packaging that TBS sells. In 2008, TBS estimated that its return program has saved taxpayers $38 million in avoided waste management and recycling program costs per year.&lt;ref name = "report2008" /&gt; In 2012, the TBS estimated that savings had increased to $40 million with 94% of beer containers and 81% of LCBO containers recycled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2013/06/28/the_average_beer_bottle_is_refilled_15_times_in_its_environmentallyfriendly_life_cycle.html |title=The average beer bottle is refilled 15 times in its environmentally-friendly life cycle |last=Teotonio |first=Isabel |date= Jun 28, 2013 |work=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store also is actively engaged in reducing its [[carbon footprint]] by finding innovative ways to reduce its energy consumption, a key input for any retail organization, especially one with a need to constantly refrigerate its product.&lt;ref name="report2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thebeerstore.ca/TBSopreport2008.pdf | title = 2008 Operational Report | publisher = The Beer Store | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101130170644/http://thebeerstore.ca/TBSopreport2008.pdf | archivedate = 2010-11-30 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable initiative is the use outside air to cool beer when outside temperatures provide for such a tactic.&lt;ref name="report2008" /&gt;

Pierre Sadik, Senior Policy Adviser at the [[David Suzuki Foundation]] has stated, "Ontarians should be proud of The Beer Store's environmental achievements. It's time businesses across the province follow The Beer Store's lead and turn their talk about waste diversion into real action."&lt;ref name="officialenvqt" /&gt;

===Corporate responsibility===

TBS maintains a strict policy of WeID 25 and the right to refuse any customer who appears intoxicated or who is underage. Furthermore, TBS empowers its retail management to actively monitor and track every employee’s refusal rate to ensure proper conformance to company policy.&lt;ref name="report2008" /&gt; In 2017, TBS employee challenge and refusal rates are the following:

RETAIL BEER CHALLENGES AND REFUSALS CY17 | Jan, 2017 – Dec, 2017

# Minors Challenged/asked to produce I.D:3,388,975 
# Minors Refused service: 31,983
# Intoxicants Challenged/suspected for being impaired (alcohol/drugs): 13,583
# Intoxicants Refused service for impairment: 10,390  
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beer Store works closely with Police agencies across Ontario to report suspected impaired driving. Also Retail employees will work with the customer in finding other means of transportation(cab/transit/call a friend) home if suspected they are impaired and refused service, they go the extra step to make sure the customer will arrive alive and not just let them find a way home.

===Returns for Leukemia===
Since 2006 The Beer Store, UFCW Local 12R24 (the union representing its employees), and the [[Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society of Canada]] have partnered together to help raise awareness and funds for blood cancer research through the collection of empty bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report| title=2014 Annual Report| url=https://www.lls.org/sites/default/files/National/USA/Pdf/LLS_AR_2014.pdf| format=PDF| p=17| publisher=Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society| accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The bottle drive is formally called "Returns for Leukemia" but many refer to it as the "Leukemia Bottle Drive". It is held on the last Saturday of May and is also the world's largest bottle drive.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Over the last 13 years, through donations of cash and empties, the event has raised over $15 million for the cause.

==Criticism==
{{original research|section|date=January 2014}}

===Brewer neutrality===
The Beer Store employees are not allowed to recommend one brand over another. Staff can tell customers about the products but cannot encourage customers to choose a specific brand. This policy is known as brewer neutrality.
The Beer Store is permitted to charge non-shareholding breweries listing fees, for each beer carried in stock, that many critics perceive as substantial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.realbeer.com/library/authors/hughey-r/distribution.php
 | title = 	Beer distribution in Canada
 | first = Robert | last = Hughey | publisher = Real Beer Media, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Listing fees have been criticized as restricting competition in the huge Ontario beer market, especially from smaller brewers who often cannot afford the fees, especially for multiple brands.

Some Canadian provinces have since allowed privately owned stores to compete for sales of beer and wine while retaining tighter controls over the sale of spirits, while Alberta has privatized all retail liquor stores. In Ontario no changes have been made, and The Beer Store continues to sell over 80% of the beer sold in the province, and is the only entity legally allowed to sell 12-packs, 24-packs, and other large cases. The Beer Store has only limited competition for retail sales of 6-packs and singles with the government-owned LCBO, select supermarkets, and individual brewer retailers, located on-site at most Ontario breweries. Furthermore, the competition is only with respect to location, as prices between supermarkets, LCBO and TBS are kept uniform. Many critics say this constitutes a foreign-owned monopoly.{{Who|date=May 2018}}

With regards to distribution, TBS operates its own fleet and provides service to over 16,000 licensed establishments in Ontario. TBS also delivers beer to Beer Stores on behalf of brewers who may choose to avoid the high cost of self-distributing. Critics have stated that TBS does not provide any credit terms for licensed clients, forcing them to pay cash on delivery, causing friction between TBS and the hospitality industry.{{Who|date=May 2018}} However, TBS does provide credit terms and flexible payment options for customers. Customers may receive up to seven days of credit terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumer prices===
Critics say TBS constitutes a foreign-owned [[monopoly]] over retail beer sales in Ontario, costing the consumer more in the long run in terms of convenience and price. Critics{{who|date=June 2014}} also state that if retail beer sales were opened up, then the average price to the consumer would drop due to competition within the marketplace. TBS has argued that the price of beer will increase if privatization occurs and points to the situations of BC and Alberta as prime examples. In an independent report titled “Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario” by economist Greg Flanagan, it was demonstrated that the general consequence of deregulating the sale of alcohol is an increase in average sale price. Since Alberta’s deregulation of alcohol in 1993, their retail alcohol prices have since tripled Ontario’s (28.2% vs 9.2%).&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, Greg. (2014) "Alcohol Retailing Deregulation: Implications for Ontario."[http://www.thebeerstore.ca/sites/default/files/pdfs/TBS_AlcoholDeregulation.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; By accounting for tax differentials and comparing the average (non-sale) 24 pack cost of beer between BC, Alberta, Quebec and Ontario, the report concludes stating that Ontarians are well served under the current regulated model.

===Political controversy===
The Beer Store has been subject to criticism following the [[Molson Coors Brewing Company|Molson-Coors]] merger, whose 49% stake in TBS was the last 100% Canadian-owned share of the venture under the pre-merger [[Molson]] Breweries. In 2005, Ontario's alcohol laws were reviewed and proposals to allow the sale of beer in grocery and convenience stores were put forth. A report called the Beverage Alcohol System Review was released on March 24, 2005 by the Ontario Government. However, the report’s findings dealt centrally with the LCBO and the economic and social impact of its privatization.

An online petition was started by a private citizen, Derek Forward, to ask the provincial government to end the monopoly enjoyed by the Beer Store. The petition has received coverage in the Toronto Star, and has generated enough support to allow it to be formally presented to the provincial legislature in the fall of 2008 for consideration (petition No. P–146: "Practice and arrangement of retailing beer"). However, on December 9, 2008, the Ontario government dismissed the petition citing the effectiveness of the TBS system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 2007 provincial election campaign, [[Brick Brewing Company|The Brick Brewing Company]] of [[Waterloo, Ontario|Waterloo]] made headlines when it claimed The Beer Store engaged in a number of discriminatory practices and policies, such as restrictions on price advertising, for causing a decline in company sales. TBS representatives denied that their policies are hurting small brewers and implicitly questioned the timing of the Brick Brewing Company's statement, suggesting that in their view it is unethical for a brewery to use an electoral campaign to forward self-interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Brick claimed  that TBS allegedly used monopolistic tactics to force what is now Ontario's largest independent brewer to stop offering beer in "Stubbies" by withholding supplies of industry standard "long-necked" bottles. The Beer Store claimed that Brick signed an agreement in 1992 to use the industry standard bottle and Brick said it never signed such an agreement. This dispute was settled out of court with the terms of the settlement undisclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brick has since stopped selling beer in "stubbies" because the cost was too high.

A July 2008 Toronto Star article attributed an industry analyst as estimating the three foreign entities that owned TBS earned $1 billion in profit per year in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.thestar.com/News/GTA/article/454836 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | first=Dana | last=Flavelle | title=Why your beer costs more | date=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ontario Craft Brewers]] is the main lobby group for Ontario's smaller brewers, and has been increasingly critical of BRI/TBS. The 29 OCB members currently employ several thousand Ontarians. OCB wants to either acquire shares in TBS or be permitted to set up their own competing chain. Premier McGuinty responded by saying that his government would not consider any application to form a competing chain, and that his government would not consider compelling TBS shareholders to sell any shares, although some Liberal and Conservative backbenchers have said they would expect BRI to at least negotiate in good faith with craft brewers who made a serious offer. BRI responded by saying that it was not considering and would not consider selling shares at any price, and that they do more than enough to accommodate non-shareholding brewers already. Canada's National Brewers (the lobby group that represents the BRI shareholders) further said that in the event OCB did get to set up a competing chain, they would refuse to stock their products there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In February 2012, the website ''Canadian Beer News'' reported that The Beer Store has made thousands of dollars worth of political donations to the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] and [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]]. The report noted that it was odd for an Ontario-based company to be making such large donations to political parties in another province, and suggested that the co-owning breweries were funneling this money through The Beer Store in an attempt to put pressure on the BC government to give their brands favourable placements in [[Liquor Distribution Branch|BC Liquor]] stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Non-competitive business practices===

On December 9, 2014, [[Toronto Star]] investigative journalist Martin Regg Cohn exposed an agreement between The Beer Store and the [[LCBO]] to limit competition and the products offered to Ontario beer drinkers.&lt;ref name="sweetheart"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/09/the_beer_stores_secret_sweetheart_deal_with_lcbo_revealed_cohn.html|title=The Beer Store’s secret sweetheart deal with LCBO revealed|last=Regg Cohn|first=Martin|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=9 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/lcbo-beer-store-deal-limits-competition-in-beer-sales-report-1.2866076|title=LCBO, Beer Store deal limits competition in beer sales: report|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document of June 1, 2000, provided to him by a [[whistleblower]], entitled “Serving Ontario Beer Consumers — Framework for Improved Co-operation and Planning Between the LCBO and BRI", was signed by then head of the LCBO [[Andy Brandt]] and head of BRI Daver Perkins, of which a copy was sent to [[Ministry of Consumer Services (Ontario)|Ministry of Consumer &amp; Commercial Relations]] Deputy Minister Sandra Lang.&lt;ref name="cbc.ca"/&gt;

The agreement ensured that the LCBO would not offer beer products in large format sizes, being cases of 12 or 24 beers, it would not sell major brands to restaurants or bars, and would inform the Beer Store of any store it was planning to open in a new community.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/09/the_beer_stores_secret_sweetheart_deal_with_lcbo_revealed_cohn.html|title=The Beer Store’s secret sweetheart deal with LCBO revealed: Cohn - Toronto Star|publisher=|accessdate=26 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regg Cohn says both retail consumers and the food and beverage industry are being gouged by this non-competitive business agreement. Former [[Toronto-Dominion Bank|TD Bank]] CEO Ed Clark, in a 2014 report to the government on maximizing assets, says that the LCBO (and the Government of Ontario) forgoes $515 million of revenue by not allowing sales of larger format beer packages and forgoes $500 million of revenue by not selling major brands to restaurants.&lt;ref name="sweetheart" /&gt;

[[Andy Brandt]], former highly successful head of the LCBO, is very critical of the agreement, and says it was forced upon him by the then [[Mike Harris]] [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government.&lt;ref name="thestar.com"/&gt; When Regg Cohn questioned the Beer Store representatives about the agreement, suggesting it is [[collusion]], the reply from the BRI lawyer Michael A. Eizenga of Bennett Jones LLP stated the "use of the term 'collusion' which has significant legal meaning," and "This is an inaccurate and inappropriate characterization, to which my client objects."&lt;ref name="bitter"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2014/12/10/bitter_fallout_from_the_beer_stores_sweetheart_deal_cohn.html|title=Bitter fallout from The Beer Store’s sweetheart deal|last=Regg Cohn|first=Martin|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=10 December 2014|accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal Finance Minister [[Charles Sousa]], in response to these revelations, says he has "got the investigation underway" and that "I'm trying to ensure that what you’re suggesting doesn’t happen any further ... You're right, there's a monopoly, a duopoly, oligopoly — call it what you will."&lt;ref name="bitter" /&gt;

On December 10, 2014, [[Restaurants Canada]] filed an official complaint with the [[Competition Bureau]]. "'We did not know the depth of the complicity,' it said, pointing to 'new and disturbing information' in the Star that detailed price gouging of restaurants and bars forced to buy from The Beer Store ... A Competition Bureau spokesperson said it is 'reviewing it to determine whether the conduct in question could raise concerns under the criminal or civil provisions in the Competition Act.'"&lt;ref name="bitter" /&gt;

On April 15, 2015, [[Premier of Ontario]] [[Kathleen Wynne]] announced changes to provincial liquor laws that would, among other changes, allow up to 450 supermarkets in "urban population centres" (roughly equating the number of Beer Store locations) to be authorized to sell beer subject to conditions, require The Beer Store to improve the placement and marketing of Ontario craft brews, and allow LCBO locations to trial carrying 12-packs. Wynne stated that The Beer Store had become a "de-facto monopoly controlled by a small number of companies".&lt;ref name=cbc-grocerybeer&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario to sell off 60% of Hydro One, allow beer in grocery stores|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/ontario-to-sell-off-60-of-hydro-one-allow-beer-in-grocery-stores-1.3035347|website=CBC News|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new regulations took effect on December 15, 2015 with 58 designated supermarkets, and additional locations to be added in the future; all products must be below 7.1% alcohol by volume, and at least 20% of a store's stock must be Ontario craft brews. [[Loblaw Companies]] elected to go beyond the minimum quota and committed to stock 50% Ontario craft brews at its participating stores, in an effort to provide a wider array of options.&lt;ref name=torstar-beerfinallyarrives&gt;{{cite web|title=Beer finally arrives in Ontario grocery stores|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/queenspark/2015/12/15/beer-arrives-in-ontario-grocery-stores.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the sale of beer in supermarkets has increased availability to consumers, it has done nothing to increase competition or lower prices for consumers. Beer prices in supermarkets are dictated by the LCBO, to the point that the LCBO, and not the supermarket, inputs beer prices into store computer check-out systems. Those prices are kept in line with LCBO and TBS prices. Depending on and accounting for the exchange rate at time of purchase, it can cost 25-40% less to buy a 24 pack of Ontario brewed beer at a New York State supermarket than it will cost anywhere in Ontario. It should be noted that current Ontario beer commodity taxes are currently a $11.30 per case compared to New York’s beer excise tax of $0.41 per case.&lt;ref&gt;As of March 2018 under the Alcohol Gaming Regulation and Public Protection Act, Ontario collects a basic beer tax of $0.8974 per litre, a volume levy of $0.176 per litre and an environmental levy of $0.0893 per non-refillable containers which equate to $11.30 per 24-cans.  New York’s 2018 state excise tax for beer is $0.14 per gallon which equates to $0.41 per case $Cdn dollars on a 24-pack of cans (assuming a U.S. conversion rate of $1.2861 (12 month average as of March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;  Federal beer excise tax and sales taxes are also higher in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://axethebeertax.ca/beertax/pdf/beercanada-report-en.pdf|title=Beer Taxes: A Canadian US Comparison: A Report for Beer Canada|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{or?|date=April 2018}}

==As map publisher==
In the 1980s, Brewers Retail published a directory of its retail locations in a booklet with a small map to each location. It had a picture of an animal, (a penguin, for example) on the covers. The booklet when closed was approximately {{convert|4|x|3|in|cm}}. The 1972 version issued by Brewers Retail had cartography by [[Rand McNally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==In popular culture==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
In the film ''[[Strange Brew]]'' the [[McKenzie Brothers]] visit a Brewers Retail store demanding a refund after they attempt to return a bottle of beer that contained a mouse (the mouse was however placed in the bottle by the brothers). Due to the nature of the scene, Brewers Retail refused to allow the use of one of their actual stores for the filming, and also refused to allow the use of the name "Brewers Retail". In response, the filmmakers built their own replica store, and called it "The Beer Store". Coincidentally, several years later, Brewers Retail changed the name of its stores to "The Beer Store", and they continue to operate under this name.

The Beer Store was also showcased in episodes of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' during O'Brien's week-long tenure in Toronto during the week of February 10, 2004.

'''''The Coffin Quilt''''' is a novel by [[Ann Rinaldi]] that was first published in 1999. Set in Kentucky, it tells the story of the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud]] in the late 19th century through the eyes of Fanny, a young female member of the McCoy family. Choosing between family and what is right is one of the major decisions Fanny McCoy has to make. When the McCoys decide to wage a war against a rival family, the Hatfields, things start to get out of hand; four of her brothers are killed by Hatfields.

==Plot==
Rinaldi tells the story of the Hatfield-McCoy feud in the late 19th century through the eyes of Fanny, a young female member of the McCoy clan. Set against the backdrop of the Civil War, Rinaldi illustrates the fervent code of honor in the mountains of Kentucky and West Virginia as her protagonist struggles to understand the superstition and loyalty fueling the cycle of violence in Tug Valley. In the end, Fanny must choose between her family and her future to escape the feud.

When Fanny’s sister, Roseanna, the “purtiest girl in the county,” has an affair with Johnse Hatfield, the slow brewing hatred between the Hatfield and the McCoys erupts. As the families take the law into their own hands through dubious pacts and midnight raids, Fanny follows her sister Roseanna into a nest of secrets. Pregnant and estranged from her lover, Roseanna sews a coffin quilt to preserve the family members so quickly disappearing from Tug Valley. Fanny disapproves of the quilt despite her loyalty to her sister and evolves from an innocent bystander to a judicious dissenter as the violence escalates. With the help of her mysterious “Yeller Thing,” Fanny learns to overcome the petty hatred plaguing both families.

==Author==
According to the author’s website, young adult author Ann Rinaldi uses her writing to excite readers about the American experience.  Her books have been noted for their ability to augment girls’ interest in history.

Due to concerns about the issue of scarcity of water, soaring food prices, population growth, high unemployment, environmental degradation, and reductions in arable land, combined with the effects of urbanization, economic development and security concerns, the Saudi government introduced combative measures from self-sufficiency to deflationary policy in wheat production. My study set out to demonstrate that these measures, which were aimed at ensuring food security, alleviating poverty, and promoting economic growth, were actually having a negative effect on many aspects of agriculture in Saudi Arabia, including the downsizing of huge farms; closure of small agricultural companies; and bankruptcy of some businesses trading in related areas such as agricultural machinery and animal health. The objectives were to analyse Saudi Arabian Government policies, assess the impact and diversity, investigate sustainability, of cultural development strategies in Saudi Arabia and investigate the attitudes and opinions on CSR in Saudi Arabia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14896">'''Turnaround management''' is a process dedicated to corporate renewal. It uses analysis and planning to save troubled companies and returns them to solvency, and to identify the reasons for failing performance  in the market, and rectify them. Turnaround management involves management review, root failure causes analysis, and [[SWOT analysis]] to determine why the company is failing. Once gdg
analysis is completed, a long term strategic plan and restructuring plan are created. These plans may or may not involve a bankruptcy filing. Once approved, turnaround professionals begin to implement the plan, continually reviewing its progress and make changes to the plan as needed to ensure the company returns to solvency.

==Turnaround Managers==
Turnaround Managers are also called Turnaround Practitioners , and often are interim managers who only stay as long as it takes to achieve the turnaround. Assignments can take anything from 3 to 24 months depending on the size of the organization and the complexity of the job. Turnaround management does not only apply to distressed companies, it in fact can help in any situation where direction, strategy or a general change of the ways of working needs to be implemented. Therefore turnaround management is closely related to change management,  transformation management and post-merger-integration management. High growth situation for example are one typical scenario where turnaround experts also help. More and more turnaround managers are becoming a one-stop-shop and provide help with corporate funding (working closely with banks and the Private Equity community) and with professional services firms (such as lawyers and insolvency practitioners) to have access to a full range of services that are typically needed in a turnaround process. Most turnaround managers are freelancers and work on day rates. The job often involves frequent travel. Others work for large corporations and have permanent positions.

==Stages==
Stages in repositioning of an organization:
# The evaluation and assessment stage
# The acute needs stage
# The restructuring stage
# The stabilization stage
# The revitalization stage

The first stage is delineated as '''onset of decline (1)'''. Factors that cause this circumstance are new innovations by competitors or a downturn in demand, which leads to a loss of market share and revenue. But also stable companies may find themselves in this stage, because of maladministration or the production of goods that are not interesting for customers. In public organisations are external shocks, like political or economical, reasons that could cause a destabilization of a performance. 
 
Sometimes an onset of decline can be temporary and through a '''corrective action and recovery (2)''' been fixed. 

The '''reposition situation (3)''' is the point in the process, where the minimally accepted performance is long-lasting below its limits. In empirical studies a performance of turnaround is measured through financial success indicators. These measures ignore other performance indicators such as impact on environment, welfare of staff, and corporate social responsibility. The organizational leaders need to decide, if a strategy change should happen or the current strategy be kept, which could lead on the other hand to a company takeover or an insolvency. In the public sector performances are characterized by multiple aims that are political contested and constructed. Nevertheless, are different criteria of performances used by different stakeholders and even if its use results in the same criteria, it is likely that different weights apply to them. So if a public organization is situated in a turnaround situation, it is subject to the dimensions of a performance (e.g. equity, efficiency, effectiveness) as well as its approach of their relative importance. This political point of view suggests that a miscarriage in a public service may happen when key stakeholders are ongoing dissatisfied by a performance and therefore the existence of an organisation might be unclear. In the public sector success and failure is judged by the higher bodies that bestow financial, legal, or other different resources on service providers.
   
If decision maker choose to take a new course, because of the realization that actions are required to prevent an ongoing decline, they need at first to '''search for new strategies (4)'''. Question that need to be asked here are, if the search for a reposition strategy should be participative and decentralized or secretive and centralized or intuitive and incremental or analytic and rational. Here, the selection must be made quickly, since a second turnaround may not be possible after a new or existing poor performance. This means, that a compressed strategy process is necessary and therefore an extensive participation and analysis may be precluded. The same applies to the public sector, because the public authorities are highly visible and politically under pressure to rapidly implement a recovery plan. 

Is the fifth stage reached, the '''selection of a new strategy (5a)''' has been made by the company. Especially researcher typically concentrates on this one of the reposition process. Most of them focus on the structure and its impact on the performance of the strategy that was implemented. It is even stated by the scientist, that a commercial success is again possible after a failing of the company. But different risk-averse groups, like suppliers, customers or staff may be against a change or are sceptical about the implementation of the strategy. These circumstances could result in a blockade of the realization. Also the conclusion is conceivable, that '''no escape strategy is found (5b)''', as a result that some targets can’t be achieved. In the public sector it is difficult to find a recoverable strategy, which therefore could lead to a permanent failure. The case may also be, that though a recovery plan is technically feasible, it might not be political executable. 

The '''implication of the new strategy (6)''' ensues in the following sixth stage. It is a necessary determinant of organizational success and has to be a fundamental element of a valid turnaround model. Nevertheless, it is important to note, that no empirical study sets a certain turnaround strategy. 

The outcomes of the turnaround strategies can result in three different ways. First of all a '''terminal decline (7a)''' may occur. This is possible for situations, where a bad strategy was chosen or a good strategy might have been implemented poorly. Another conceivable outcome is a '''continued failure (7b)'''. Here is the restructuring plan failed, but dominant members within the company and the environment still believe that a repositioning is possible. If that’s the case, they need to restart at stage four and look for a new strategy. Does an outcome of the new strategy turns out to be good, a '''turnaround (7c)''' is called successful. This is achieved, when its appropriate benchmark reaches the level of commercial success, like it was the case before the onset of decline. This is commonly measured in a timeframe between two and four year.

==Techniques==

There are different techniques that can be applied to cause a repositioning. The four main techniques are known as Retrenchment, Repositioning, Replacement and Renewal:

===Retrenchment===

The Retrenchment strategy of the turnaround management describes wide-ranging short-term actions, to reduce financial losses, to stabilize the company and to work against the problems, that caused the poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, K./ Harvey, G./ Hyde, P./ Pandit, N. (2004): Organizational Failure and Turnaround: Lessons for Public Services from the For-Profit Sector, in Public Money &amp; Management, Vol. 24, No. 4 (August, 2004), pp. 201–208. (p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt;
The essential content of the Retrenchment strategy is therefore to reduce scope and the size of a business through Shrinking Selective Strategy. This can be done by selling assets, abandoning difficult markets, stopping unprofitable production lines, downsizing and outsourcing. These procedures are used to generate resources, with the intention to utilize those for more productive activities, and prevent financial losses. Retrenchment is therefore all about an efficient orientation and a refocus on the core business.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A./ Meier, K. (2009): Environmental Change, Human Resources and Organizational Turnaround, in: Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 46, No. 5 (July, 2009), pp. 835–863. (p. 843)&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite that many companies are inhibited to perform cutbacks, some of them manage to overcome the resistance. As a result they are able get a better market position in spite of the reductions they made&lt;ref&gt;Robbins, D. K./ Pearce II, J. A. (1992): Retrenchment und Recovery, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 13, No. 4 (May, 1992), pp. 287–309. (p.290)&lt;/ref&gt; and increase productivity and efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Barker III, V. L./ Duhaime, I. M. (1997): Change in the Turnaround Process: Theory and Empirical Evidence, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 13–38. (p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt;  Most practitioners even mention, that a successful turnaround without a planned retrenchment is rarely feasible.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A. (2006): Strategies for Public Service Turnaround: Lessons from the Private Sector?, in: Administration &amp; Society, Vol. 38, No. 3 (July 2006), pp. 365–388. (p. 378)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repositioning===

The repositioning strategy, also known as "entrepreneurial strategy", attempts to generate revenue with new innovations and change in product portfolio and [[Positioning (marketing)|market position]]. This includes development of new products, entering new markets, exploring alternative sources of revenue and modifying the image or the mission of a company.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A./ Meier, K. (2009): Environmental Change, Human Resources and Organizational Turnaround, in: Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 46, No. 5 (July, 2009), pp. 835–863. (p. 844)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacement===

Replacement is a strategy, where top managers or the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) are replaced by new ones. This turnaround strategy is used, because it is theorized that new managers bring recovery and a strategic change, as a result of their different experience and backgrounds from their previous work.&lt;ref&gt;Barker III, V. L./ Duhaime, I. M. (1997): Change in the Turnaround Process: Theory and Empirical Evidence, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 13–38. (p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt;  
It is also indispensable to be aware, that new CEO’s can cause problems, which are obstructive to achieve a turnaround. For an example, if they change effective organized routines or introduce new administrative overheads and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, G. A./ Meier, K. (2009): Environmental Change, Human Resources and Organizational Turnaround, in: Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 46, No. 5 (July, 2009), pp. 835–863. (p. 842)&lt;/ref&gt;
Replacement is especially qualified for situations with opinionated CEO’s, which are not able to think impartial about certain problems. Instead they rely on their past experience for running the business or belittle the situation as short-termed. The established leaders fail therefore to recognize that a change in the business strategy is necessary to keep the company viable. There are also situations, where CEO’s do notice that a current strategy isn’t successful as it should be. But this hasn’t to imply, that they are capable or even qualified enough to accomplish a turnaround.&lt;ref&gt;Castrogiovanni, G. J./ Baliga, B. R./ Kidwell Jr., R. E. (1992): Curing Sick Businesses: Changing CEOs in Turnaround Efforts, in: The Executive, Vol. 6, No. 3 (Aug. 1992), pp. 26–41. (pp. 28)&lt;/ref&gt;
Is a company against a Replacement of a leader, could this end in a situation, where the declining process will be continued. As result qualified employees resign, the organisation discredits and the resources left will run out as time goes by.&lt;ref&gt;Barker III, V. L./ Duhaime, I. M. (1997): Change in the Turnaround Process: Theory and Empirical Evidence, in: Strategic Management Journal, Vol. 18, No. 1 (Jan., 1997), pp. 13–38. (p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renewal===

With a Renewal a company pursues long-term actions, which are supposed to end in a successful managerial performance. The first step here is to analyze the existing structures within the organization. This examination may end with a closure of some divisions, a development of new markets/ projects or an expansion in other business areas.&lt;ref&gt;Walshe, K./ Harvey, G./ Hyde, P./ Pandit, N. (2004): Organizational Failure and Turnaround: Lessons for Public Services from the For-Profit Sector, in Public Money &amp; Management, Vol. 24, No. 4 (August, 2004), pp. 201–208. (p. 204)&lt;/ref&gt; A Renewal may also lead to consequences within a company, like the removal of efficient routines or resources. On the other hand are innovative core competencies implemented, which conclude in an increase of knowledge and a stabilization of the company value.&lt;ref&gt;Ruiz-Navarro, J. (1998): Turnaround and Renewal in a Spanish Shipyard, in: Long Range Planning, Vol. 31, No. 1 (1998), pp. 51–59. (p. 51)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hurdles or challenges==
Three critical hurdles or challenges that management faces in any repositioning program:
# '''Design''': What type of restructuring is appropriate for dealing with the specific challenge, problem, or opportunity that the company faces?
# '''Execution''': How should the restructuring process be managed and the many barriers to restructuring overcome so that as much value is created as possible?&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, A &amp; Raisch, S. (2013): “Corporate turnarounds: The duality of retrenchment and recovery”, Journal of Management Studies, Vol. 50, Issue 7, pp. 1216-1243&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Marketing''': How should the restructuring be explained and portrayed to investors so that value created inside the company is fully credited to its stock price?

==Professional organizations==

Some are:

* [[Turnaround Management Society]] (International / Focus on Europe)

'''The University of Haifa's Younes and Soraya Nazarian Library''' is a central [[academic library]], among the largest in [[Israel]]. It is one of the most progressive Israeli libraries in the realm of services and technology and library information systems.

From its founding in 1963, the Library has operated under one roof and is managed by a central administration. The Library offers academic information expertise for locating the wide range of material in its holdings and accessible via the Internet. The Library's role in the University's academic activity is based on professional specialization, which enables provision of information services in a wide variety of disciplines and information types.

The Library devotes resources to the development, [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and [[digitization]] of [[special collections]], such as [[dissertations]], research publications, historical photographs of the [[Land of Israel]], and archives of theatrical and performing arts. The collections, which are compiled and displayed in the "Digital Media Center", contribute to instruction and research in the University and beyond. Special emphasis is placed on ensuring accessibility in both the short and long term to the academic community and to the general public interested in matters of heritage preservation. An additional distinctive project is the production of the "Index to Hebrew Periodicals," a database of [[Hebrew-language]] articles and [[periodicals]].

==The Collection==
[[Image:shelves.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Shelves in the general collection – Younes and Soraya Nazarian Library, University of Haifa]]

The Library collection comprises over two million items, including books and periodicals (in printed and digital formats), [[online databases]] in a variety of disciplines, maps and other [[cartographic]] material, films, audio recordings, pictures and archival material. All Library items may be searched and retrieved by means of "[[OneSearch]]" - a unified search box in the Library web site.

The Library's central collections include:

* General Collection – Most books are located in this open-shelf collection, and may be borrowed for two weeks.
* Reserves Collection – Numbers over 15,000 items, including: books for instructional use transferred to the collection by request of lecturers; a collection of psychological evaluation tests; and lecturers' private books made available for student use. Most items in this collection may be borrowed for three days, some for one night only, and some are for in-house use.
* Periodicals Collection – This collection is divided into Loazi (i.e., non-Hebrew) titles, Hebrew titles and [[microforms]]. Periodicals may be borrowed for one week, by University staff members and [[Ph.D.]] students only. {{as of|2011}}, the Periodicals Collection held over 45,000 titles, including over 20,000 electronic journals.
* Media Collection –Holds audio-visual library materials, such as [[video]], [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]], [[music scores]], [[discs]], [[map]]s, [[satellite images]], [[aerial photography]], [[atlases]], globes and historical maps. Along with these items are the tools enabling use of non-print material (stereo, video and DVD systems). In addition, there are special collections of books in the fields of art, [[photography]], [[geography]], [[environmental studies]], music, [[archeology]] and [[cartography]], as well as relevant printed material accompanying the non-print collections.
*Law Collection –Contains print and electronic materials, including legal literature from Israel and other countries: books, periodicals and legal encyclopedias. There are also reserve books, required readings for courses in the Law Faculty, by request of the lecturers; Israeli and foreign legislation and court decisions; and legal databases. 
*Psychological Test Collection – Contains questionnaires and assessment instruments in a variety of fields, such as [[psychology]], [[occupational therapy]], [[physiotherapy]] and [[learning disorders]]. To facilitate development of the collection, the Library maintains ongoing contact with the various departments that make use of it. In addition, every questionnaire in dissertations – whether original, translated or adapted – is cataloged. 
*Dictionary Collection – Includes dictionaries for many languages, which may be borrowed only for the purpose of examinations.
*Children's Literature Collection – Holds about 22,000 books for leisure and informational reading, some 20,000 in Hebrew and 2000 in Arabic. The books may not be borrowed. Various activities in the areas of information literacy and encouragement of reading take place in the collection, for public-school and special-education pupils. The “Subject Index to Children’s and Youth Literature,” developed by the Library, makes it possible to search the collection by topic.
*Rare Books Collection – Contains over 3000 books, including special items that can no longer be purchased, books issued in limited editions, and books that are important due to their binding. Among the items in the rare books collection are works of [[Judaica]], single pages from the [[Geniza]], and [[Spinoza]]’s “[[Theological-Political Treatise]],” including the author’s handwritten notes.
*Abba Khoushi archive – Holds many documents, lectures, protocols, pictures, and some personal items of Abba Khoushi from the years 1919-1969, which accumulated during his years in Israel as a public figure and party activist, as secretary of the [[Haifa]] Workers’ Council and mayor of Haifa from 1951-1969.
In addition to the above, varied collections of digital photographs, as well as the Database for Israeli Theater Archives, are accessible through the Library's “Digital Media Center.”

==Reader Services==

{{as of|2012}}, some 160 computer stations are available to Library visitors for searching and retrieving information. 
The Library's resources are available to the University community from off-campus as well.
The Library has several helpdesks: Circulation and [[Interlibrary Loan]]; [[Reference]]; Reserves-Media and [[Periodicals]]. All helpdesks are concentrated in the entry level.

Users may also get assistance from the remote reference service, including replies via electronic mail, telephone and online conversations (“chat”). The Library also provides a service for photocopying, scanning and color printing, [[CD burning]] and document binding. Within the Library building there is access to [[wireless]] Internet.

There is free admission to the Library for visitors, including high-school students from 10th grade and up. Most Library collections are freely accessible. There is a charge for requesting assistance from the librarians for locating materials.

==Location and Structure of the Library Over the Years==
[[Image:sever.png|right|300px|thumb|Visit of Prof. Ephraim Katzir, fourth President of Israel, to the University of Haifa Library, 15 November 1976. To Katzir’s right is Prof. Shmuel Sever, Library Director, and to his left Eliezer Refaeli, University President. The librarians are Rina Irmai (left) and Sarah Spiegel (right).]]

The Library's location has changed over the years since it first opened in 1963, in the High School in Edelstein House on Y.L. Peretz Street in the [[Hadar HaCarmel]] neighborhood.

In the mid-1960s the Library – in the framework of the “University Institute of Haifa” - moved to a new location in the Haifa city school “Ironi Heh”, on Bikurim Street in Hadar HaCarmel. From 1969 until summer 1973 the Library was temporarily transferred to the upper floor of the Multi-Purpose Building on the new University campus.

In the early 1970s, construction of the Library in its current location commenced, as part of the project for establishing the University, designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. In keeping with the architect's conception of a “university under one roof,” the Library was founded as a central library serving all the faculties, constituting an academic center where people from varied disciplines would interact for mutual enrichment.

Professor Shmuel Sever, the Library's director at the time, devoted several months to planning a modern, large library that would serve well into the future. Architect Shlomo Gilad translated his concepts and vision into architectural plans. Oscar Niemeyer designed the building in which the Library is located in the style of “Brutalistic architecture,” characterized by building with bare concrete in both simple and compound forms to create broad, open spaces that facilitate interior division and future expansion. This approach was common between the 1950s and mid-1980s, due to the influence of [[Le Corbusier]].

The planning and construction work continued several years, and as luck would have it, concluded just at the unexpected outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]]. Despite the constraints and the lack of male workers for putting up shelves, maintenance and carrying loads, Prof. Shmuel Sever requested that the Library move to its new quarters as scheduled. And in fact, after detailed planning and despite the severe shortage of workers, librarians and books alike were transferred to the new location.
Readers could now make use of a large, high-ceilinged reading room (which was said to be, at the time, the largest in the Middle East), whose eastern façade was composed entirely of windows facing onto the splendid view of [[Haifa Bay]]. The reading room itself held tens of work tables and chairs, the angle of whose backrests had been selected from several models by a poll of readers.

The books themselves were housed in galleries on the Library's four levels. Broad corridors, stretching from east to west in the building, ensured maximal illumination. An explicit order from architect Gilad forbade closing these corridors, lest the daylight be blocked. New, brown carpets added warmth to the Library, and wood paneling on shelves and walls softened their grayish color.

It seemed, at the time, that the bookshelves would last forever, that the Library had no boundaries, and was destined to serve its patrons for many years. In fact, the Library that Niemeyer designed fulfilled its purpose for over thirty years. But at the beginning of the 21st century, the Library found itself too small and outdated to accommodate its growing collections and the advanced services and technologies it provided. It was not equipped to respond to changing research and teaching needs and its patrons' expectations of an inviting, friendly environment.

Prof. Baruch Kipnis, director of the Library from 2001-2005, initiated the idea of expanding and renovating the Library according to the planning principles that he set forth and the architectural program that he prepared along with the Library staff. His persuasive efforts succeeded in obtaining the agreement of the University's administration to support the idea of expansion and renovation.

In 2002, an architectural competition took place based on the principles and program that had been formulated. Architect Asaf Lerman was selected to carry out the planning and supervise the construction of a new wing. The project of erecting the building received impetus following receipt of a generous donation from the Nazarian family [see below]. Library director Oren Weinberg oversaw the construction work until its completion.

Lerman selected fashionable materials such as bare concrete, glass and wood, and planned the new wing in a neo-modernistic spirit, creating a successful dialog with the old wing built in the modernistic style of Niemeyer.  Construction was completed in 2010.  For his planning of the new wing, Architect Lerman was selected as one of five finalists for the 2010 [[Rechter Prize]] in architecture.

Renovation of the original library wing, including reorganization of the Library entrance, interior spaces, study corners, a central service area and circulation desks, was completed in June 2012.

==The Donation that Resulted in the Library’s Expansion, 2007-2012==
[[File:Librarypatio.jpg|thumb|right|300px|thumb|Entrance and patio, south wing 2012.]]

In 2007, Soraya and [[Younes Nazarian]], leading members of the community of expatriate [[Iranian Jews]] in Los Angeles, made a generous donation to the University for the purpose of renovating and expanding the Library, including construction of a new wing.

The Nazarians are known for their philanthropic activities on behalf of the community in a variety of fields, including the arts, health and the development of institutions of higher education in the United States and Israel. The couple donates to educational institutions in Israel out of a conviction that education is essential for Israel's future. They believe that investment in education will improve not only the personal condition of each citizen, but also the economic situation of the whole nation.

In June 2007, Younes Nazarian received an [[honorary doctorate]] during the meeting of the University's Board of Governors, in recognition of his donation and commitment to the State of Israel and to Jews the world over.

The dedication ceremony for the new wing, officially named the “South Wing”,  took place on 31 May 2011, at which time the Library was renamed the “Younes and Soraya Nazarian Library, University of Haifa.” On June 3, 2012 – during the 40th annual meeting of the University's Board of Governors and in the presence of the donors - an additional festive dedication ceremony was held to mark the conclusion of the Library renovation.

==Technological Development in the Library – From Card Catalog to “OneSearch”==
[[Image:people s 013.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Traditional card catalog]]

From the time the Library opened in the early 1960s, it has developed in keeping with changes in the technological environment. A central change was the transition from use of the [[Dewey Decimal classification]] system to that of the [[Library of Congress]], which was at the time unknown in Israel. This transition was led by Prof. Elhanan Adler and Aviva Shichor.  Additional milestones were the computer revolution that the Library underwent from the end of the 1970s and the introduction of the Internet at the beginning of the 1990s.

Technological developments influenced the means of storing information, the Library catalog and databases on the one hand, and retrieval of information, on the other. The many transformations in the professional work of librarians and information specialists and in the use of the Library and its resources included remote access to the Library catalog and bibliographic databases, electronic periodicals and books, and remote reference services (by means of telephone, email and live conversation – Chat).

The influence of technological advancement is evident throughout the Library. The traditional [[card catalog]] was replaced in the 1980s by a computerized catalog, which itself evolved over years and became accessible via the Internet. Access to many databases was transformed from a local CD network to online formats. Most periodicals were converted to digital format, accessible from anywhere at any time. Collections of slides, photographs and products of University research were scanned and merged into the Digital Media Center. Over time, electronic books constitute an ever-larger proportion of the Library's collection.

A unique project of the Library is the “Index to Hebrew Periodicals”, a multi-disciplinary tool that provides users access to academic articles as well as business and popular ones. The Index contains citations to hundreds of thousands of articles from selected periodicals, collections and daily newspapers in many fields: Judaica, literature, education, history, archeology, the arts, architecture, medicine, law, agriculture, nature, science, technology, society and the nation. Since its inception in 1977, the indexing project was transformed over the years from a printed format to a computerized one, and was eventually incorporated into the Library services available via the Internet.

With the opening of the 2009-2010 academic year, the Library's online services were unified under the “OneSearch” portal – based on the Ex Libris “Primo” system - providing a single entry point to all the Library's resources. The Library was the first in Israel to adopt Primo and to develop and integrate a Hebrew interface (graphic design and text) for the portal, in line with the expectations and requests of users.

==Assessment and Measurement Activities==

Since 2007, the Library has regularly carried out [[Library assessment|assessment]] and measurement activities aimed at determining the quality of its services based on user feedback. For this purpose, a number of activities are performed, including surveys, audits and focus groups. These examine varied aspects of the Library's services: the physical environment, identifying user needs, collection evaluation, evaluation of user interfaces to the Library's content and services – both within the Library and via remote access.

Once every three years the Library conducts a "LibQUAL survey". LibQUAL, established and managed by the [[Association of Research Libraries|Association of Research Libraries (ARL)]] in the United States and Canada, is part of an international survey that has so far been carried out in more than 1000 academic libraries worldwide. The University of Haifa Library is the first Israeli library to participate, and assisted in developing the Hebrew version of the survey.

The Library maintains a dedicated website that publicizes all the evaluation and measuring activities, the results of surveys, and actions taken by the Library in light of the results.
