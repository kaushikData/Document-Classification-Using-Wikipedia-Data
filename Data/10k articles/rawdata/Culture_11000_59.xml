'''''08/15''''' is a 1954–55 West German film trilogy directed by [[Paul May]] and based on the novel ''08/15'' by [[Hans Hellmut Kirst]] who also served as the film's screenwriter (published in English as "The Revolt of Gunner Asch"). The term ''08/15'' (nill-eight/fifteen, {{lang-de|Null-Acht/Fünfzehn}}) refers to the German Army's standard machine gun, the 08/15 (or [[MG 08|MG 08 model 15]]), by far, the most common German machine gun deployed in [[World War I]]. It was manufactured in such large quantities that it became the German Army slang for anything that was standard issue.&lt;ref name="Bartov 2004"/&gt; 

The film follows the story of Private Asch, a German soldier in [[World War II]]. The film title implies that Asch, and the soldiers under his command, were unostentatious (i.e. "run-of-the-mill") characters deployed on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name="Bartov 2004"&gt;Bartov, Omer (2004). "Celluloid Soldiers: Cinematic Images of the Wehrmacht". In Ljubica &amp; Mark Erickson. ''Russia War, Peace and Diplomacy.'' London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-84913-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
The last of the ''08/15'' film trilogy ends with Germany being occupied by American soldiers who are portrayed as bubble-gum chewing, slack-jawed, uncultured louts, inferior in every respect to the heroic German soldiers.&lt;ref name="Bartov 2004" /&gt; The only exception is the Jewish emigrant, now a US officer, who is shown as both intelligent and unscrupulous, the fact interpreted by Professor [[Omer Bartov]] as implying that the "real tragedy of World War II was that the Nazis did not get a chance to exterminate all Semites, who have now returned with Germany's defeat to once more exploit the German people".&lt;ref name="Bartov 2004" /&gt; "Although Asch is never identified with the Americans – indeed, in the final film of the trilogy, the Americans appear to be nearly as dangerous a foe as the ''[[SS]]''."&lt;ref&gt;''Screening War: Perspectives on German Suffering'', page 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Adoration of the Shepherds''''' is a painting of 1633–34 by the French painter [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594–1665), now in the [[National Gallery, London]] (Room 19). It is in [[oil painting|oils]] on canvas, and measures {{convert|97.2 x 74| cm}} (with uneven edges). Unusually for Poussin, it is signed "N. Pusin.fe" ["[[fecit]]"] on the stone at lower right.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1637, soon after it was painted, it was owned by Cardinal [[Gian Carlo de' Medici]] (1611{{ndash}}1663),&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; the second son of [[Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany]] and was placed in his villa outside [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

It belongs to a group of paintings with a predominately "coppery" colour scheme, from which its dating mainly derives. Classicising elements have been added to the usual figures.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 337–339&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was evidently well-regarded, and 20 painted copies are recorded from approximately the next century, as well as seven [[old master print|print]] versions made between the 1660s and 1813.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334–336&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of drawings, some showing what appear to be early thoughts about the composition, though some may not be by Poussin or were created before the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334–339&lt;/ref&gt;  As is often the case with Poussin, elements of the painting reflect the works of other artists, including [[Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 337–338&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description ==
To the usual cast of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art]] are added the earlier scene of the [[Annunciation to the Shepherds]] in the distance at the centre, five ''[[putti]]'' above, about to shower the scene with flowers, and a woman at left holding a large [[wicker]] tray with fruit.  The scene takes place in a large but derelict classical building, to which a crude wooden lean-to stable has been added. The golden stone of the building is echoed by the tanned bodies of the shepherds, the cloudy sky, and other elements, giving an unusually unified "coppery" colour scheme to the painting, with the blue of the [[Virgin Mary]]'s mantle and that of the woman carrying the fruit the other prominent colour.  The ox, to the right of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], almost disappears into the wall behind him.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike those in the still central scene, the figures in the small background Annunciation to the Shepherds are highly agitated, with extreme and strenuous poses. The gesturing angel is loosely painted in white against the cloud, just above the foremost vine leaves in the basket.  Like other figures by Poussin from this period, the foreground figures seem to have a frozen sculptural quality.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 162&lt;/ref&gt; The figure with a green dress is female.  The foremost kneeling shepherd is close to, and perhaps derived from, a shepherd in a painting of the Nativity by [[Raphael]] ([[Vatican Loggie]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338–339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date==
Other paintings by Poussin, generally dated to the years between 1633 and 1634, have similar colour schemes.  The ''Adoration of the Magi'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]] in [[Dresden]] (illustrated) is dated 1633; it has a very similar setting but a more varied colour scheme, so the London ''Adoration of the Shepherds'' is assumed to be later than that.  The ''Saving of the Infant Pyrrhus'' in the [[Louvre]], with a similar unified "coppery" scheme, has now been shown to have been finished by 1634 at the latest, so the London painting is now assigned to 1633–34 with reference to these, and also a drawing with a preparatory sketch on the [[verso]], now in the [[Royal Collection]].  This was made for Marshall [[Charles III de Créquy]] when he was French ambassador to Rome, resident there between June 1633 and July 1634.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338–339&lt;/ref&gt;

Another "coppery-toned" National Gallery Possin (in 2015 hanging next to this one) is ''[[The Adoration of the Golden Calf]]'', also dated 1633–34, largely on the basis of this similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 320&lt;/ref&gt;  This is usually thought to have been painted as a pair with ''[[The Crossing of the Red Sea (Poussin)|The Crossing of the Red Sea]]'', now [[National Gallery of Victoria]], [[Melbourne]]; the two remained together until 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 314, 319–320&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The painting was done when Poussin was approaching the age of 40. He had been in Rome since 1624, and enjoyed some success in the 1620s, in particular when his main patrons were not abroad on embassies. These were Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (1597–1679)|Francesco Barberini]] (1597–1679), nephew of the current Pope, [[Urban VIII]] (reigned 1623–1644), and his secretary, the [[antiquarian]] [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]] (1588–1657), who was to remain an important friend and patron of Poussin.  However, when in 1628 Barberini secured him the commission for an [[altarpiece]] in [[St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]], the ''Martyrdom of St Erasmus'' ([[Pinacoteca Vaticana]]), its reception seems to have been lukewarm, which perhaps triggered a change in Poussin's career, along with a period of illness in 1629 or 1630.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 159–160; Mahon, 16–40 and throughout; Wine, 276&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time he seems to have abandoned the pursuit of the many rich commissions Rome offered for large paintings for churches and palaces, and henceforth painted only canvases of a relatively small size for "a small circle of ''[[Connoisseur|cognoscenti]]''",&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 160&lt;/ref&gt; led by dal Pozzo. That this painting quickly passed to a Medici prince-cardinal makes it rather untypical for this period, though during the 1630s awareness of Poussin's talent was growing in the French court, until he was eventually ordered by the king to return to Paris in 1640 (he escaped back to Rome two years later, and never left again).&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 163–165&lt;/ref&gt;

His style and subject-matter also changed at the end of the 1620s, switching away from the influence of [[Italian Baroque art|Italian baroque]]  painters to a classicism influenced by [[classical sculpture]] and the [[High Renaissance]]. His paintings from about 1629 to 1633 are nearly all drawn from [[classical mythology]], or the epics of [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]]. The Dresden ''Adoration'', dated 1633, perhaps marks the end of this phase, and for the rest of the 1630s his subjects become once again more varied.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 160–163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:L'Adoration des bergers, 1633, Londres, National Gallery (cropped5).jpg|thumb|Detail of the ''[[putti]]'']]
Nativity scenes are very often given such classical settings.  As well as showing off the artist's skill and learning they acted as a reminder of the medieval legend, reported in the popular compilation of the ''[[Golden Legend]]'', that on the night of Christ's birth the [[Basilica of Maxentius]] in Rome, supposed to house a statue of [[Romulus]], had partly tumbled to the ground, leaving the impressive ruins that survive today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Lloyd|Lloyd, Christopher]], ''The Queen's Pictures, Royal Collectors through the centuries'', p.226, National Gallery Publications, 1991, {{ISBN|0-947645-89-6}}. In fact the Basilica was not built until the 4th century. Some later painters used the remains as a basis for their depictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another meaning for the ruined temple went back to 15th-century [[Early Netherlandish painting]], when the usual simple shed of the Nativity stable, little changed from [[Late Antiquity]], had developed into an elaborate ruined temple, initially [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] in style, which represented the dilapidated state of the [[Covenant (biblical)|Old Covenant]] of the [[Jewish law]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49–50. Purtle, Carol J, "Van Eyck's Washington 'Annunciation': narrative time and metaphoric tradition", p.4 and notes 9–14, ''Art Bulletin'', March, 1999. Page references are to online version. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0422/is_1_81/ai_54517312 online text]. Also see [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf ''The Iconography of the Temple in Northern Renaissance Art'' by Yona Pinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326170616/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italian works the architecture of such temples became classical, reflecting the growing interest in the ancient world, and the ruins that remained in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller:91-82&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman with the fruit can be paralleled in some other paintings, and if the work was actually commissioned by Cardinal de' Medici, a reference to a statue of ''Plenty'' by [[Donatello]], now lost but then prominently displayed in the Mercato Vecchio of his home-city of Florence, may have been intended.  It was also a Florentine custom to bring gifts of fruit to women after childbirth, no doubt to be placed on their ''[[desco da parto]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338&lt;/ref&gt;  Various meanings might be attached to both the apples and grapes the woman appears to carry, and the types of flowers held by the ''putti'', though other than the [[jasmine]] held by the top left ''putto'', the identification of these is not entirely clear.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 338&lt;/ref&gt;

The main surviving preparatory drawing is in the [[British Museum]].  This is in a horizontal format, just showing the lower part, and may suggest that Poussin originally intended a smaller painting with a horizontal format, although the drawing is cut along its top edge. This includes an upturned [[pediment]] stone at bottom left, a low arch in the centre at what is now about halfway up the final composition, and a lamb lying below Jesus.  [[Christ Church Picture Gallery]] in [[Oxford]] has a drawing with the ''putti'', again with differences in the architectural background.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 339&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
The painting was still in the collection of Cardinal Gian Carlo de' Medici in a posthumous inventory in 1663, after which it may have moved to France, where a ''Nativity'' attributed to Poussin is recorded in a number of collections for the next century. These include that of [[Louis Phélypeaux (1643-1727)|Louis II Phélypeaux]] (1643–1727), better known as the chancellor de Pontchartrain, an important French politician.&lt;ref&gt;His jobs included: [[Secretary of State of the Navy (France)]], [[Secretary of State of the Maison du Roi]], [[Controller-General of Finances]], [[Chancellor of France]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] noted seeing such a painting in his collection in 1665,&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; and one is recorded in his wife's collection in 1672. Another mention, from 1700, is in the collection of [[André Le Nôtre]] (1613–1700), the landscape architect and principal gardener of King [[Louis XIV of France]],&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; and there are two further owners of what was probably the same painting, ending in a posthumous sale in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point it may have passed to England; in 1795 what was certainly the same painting was in the posthumous sale of Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]' collection at [[Christie's]],&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; where it fetched 205 guineas.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt; It was bought by the painter and dealer [[Henry Walton (English painter)|Henry Walton]] who sold it a year later to Sir Thomas Beauchamp-Proctor, 2nd Baronet (1756–1827).&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;  It remained in the collections of the [[Proctor-Beauchamp baronets]] and their family between 1796 and 1956, when it fetched £29,000 at [[Sotheby's]], bought by an overseas collector.  An export licence was deferred, allowing the National Gallery to buy the work for £33,100 in 1957, with funds from the Temple-West Fund, the [[The Art Fund|NACF]], and a special Treasury grant.  It is catalogued as NG 6277.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition==
The condition is "generally good ... but with some wear".  There are some minor [[pentimenti]] and retouches. As of 2001, the painting was last "cleaned and restored" in 1958, then "surface cleaned and revarnished" in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 336&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Apart from National Gallery exhibitions since 1957, it has travelled to the [[Royal Academy]] in 1880 and 1995, [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] 1992–93 and Paris in 1994–95 ([[Grand Palais]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wine, 334&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alexander Nikolayevich Veselovsky''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Весело́вский}}) ({{OldStyleDate|February 16|1838|February 4}} in [[Moscow]] – {{OldStyleDate|October 23|1906|October 10}} in [[St. Petersburg]]) was a leading [[Russian Empire|Russian]] literary theorist who laid the groundwork for [[comparative literature|comparative literary studies]].

== Life and work ==

A general's son, Veselovsky studied privately with [[Fyodor Buslaev]] and attended the [[Moscow University]] from 1854 to 1858. After a brief stint in [[Spain]] as a tutor to the Russian ambassador's son, Veselovsky continued his education with [[Heymann Steinthal]] in [[Berlin]] and [[Prague]] and spent three years working in the libraries of [[Italy]]. Upon his return to Russia, he delivered lectures in Moscow and St. Petersburg and was elected a Member of the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] in 1876.

Veselovsky's early studies of medieval [[Italian literature]] led him to believe that many plots and literary devices were imported to Europe from the [[Orient]] through [[Byzantium]]. Looking at literature primarily from a genetic point of view, Alexander Veselovsky and his brother [[Aleksey Veselovsky|Aleksey]] (1843-1918) attempted to construct a comprehensive theory of the origin and development of poetry. In 1899, the elder brother famously argued that "the font and syncretic root of poetic genres" may be traced to ritualized popular games and folk incantations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eleazar Meletinsky]]. ''The Poetics of Myth''. Routledge, 1998. Page 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==

In the [[Soviet Union]], Veselovsky and his followers were criticized for their "ethnographism", which allowed "source study to grow to a hypertrophied degree, thus dissolving the specific character of the literary work into a collection of ''influences''".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Polonsky (''English Literature and the Russian Aesthetic Renaissance''. Cambridge University Press, 1998. Page 17) quoting: Jauss, Hans Robert. ''Toward an Aesthetic of Reception.'' University of Minnesota Press, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 August 1946 the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party]] adopted a resolution specifically condemning "kowtowing" to the bourgeois West by the so-called Veselovskyists.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mikhail Bakhtin]], ''Rabelais and His World''. Indiana University Press, 1984. Page XX.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Formalists]] largely shared a critical view of Veselovsky's theory, although it has been suggested that Veselovsky's doctrine was actually a point from which they evolved "in a linear, if polemical, way".&lt;ref&gt;Dragan Kujundzic. ''The Returns of History: Russian Nietzscheans After Modernity''. SUNY Press, 1997. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although his work has been largely forgotten by Western scholarship (probably due to lack of translations), Veselovsky has been called "one of the most erudite and original scholars Russia has produced"&lt;ref&gt;''Gogol from the Twentieth Century: Eleven Essays'', ed. Robert A. Maguire. Princeton University Press, 1974. Pages 39-40.&lt;/ref&gt; and "the most remarkable representative of comparative literary study in Russian and European scholarship of the nineteenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Polonsky (''English Literature and the Russian Aesthetic Renaissance''. Cambridge University Press, 1998. Page 17) quoting [[Viktor Zhirmunsky|Zhirmunsky]]'s ''Sravnitelnoe literaturovedenie'', p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allophilia''' is having a positive attitude towards outgroup members. The outgroup members can be anyone who possesses characteristics that are different from one's own, such as people of different [[Race (human categorization)|races]], [[religion]]s, [[culture]]s, etc. It is a framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership and is conceptualized as a measurable state of mind with tangible consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Allophilia—a new framework for understanding effective intergroup leadership|author= Todd Pittinsky|url= http://www.centerforpublicleadership.org/?option=com_content&amp;task=emailform&amp;id=267&amp;itemid=2|newspaper= [[Center for Public Leadership]], [[Harvard Kennedy School]]|date= |accessdate= 18 June 2013|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://archive.is/20130620034033/http://www.centerforpublicleadership.org/?option=com_content&amp;task=emailform&amp;id=267&amp;itemid=2|archivedate= 20 June 2013|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Positive prejudice: Really loving your neighbour |author= |url= http://www.economist.com/node/8859092 |newspaper= [[The Economist]]|date= 15 March 2007 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "allophilia" was coined by [[Harvard]] professor Todd L. Pittinsky in 2006, after he was unable to find an antonym for prejudice in any dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Otherly Love: The Law of Dissimilars|author= Ashley Pettus|url= http://harvardmagazine.com/2006/01/the-law-of-dissimilars.html|newspaper= [[Harvard Magazine]] |date=January 2006 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] words meaning "liking or love of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L. (2010). A two-dimensional theory of intergroup leadership: The case of national diversity. American Psychologist, 65(3), 194-200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allophilia has five statistical factors:

# comfort,
# engagement,
# enthusiasm,
# kinship.

The Allophilia Scale measures each of these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Allophilia: Beyond tolerance lies true respect|author= Sheema Khan|url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/allophilia-beyond-tolerance-lies-true-respect/article9130024/|newspaper= [[The Globe and Mail]] |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=18 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T.

'''Allophilia, Prejudice, and Positive Intergroup Relations'''

The typical remedy for [[prejudice]] is to bring conflicting groups into a state of tolerance. However, tolerance is not the logical antithesis of prejudice, but rather is the midpoint between negative feelings and positive feelings toward others. Allophilia enhancement should serve as complement to prejudice reduction.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;Pittinsky, T. L., &amp; Montoya, R. M. (2009). Symhedonia in intergroup relations: The relationship of empathic joy to prejudice and allophilia. Psicologia Sociale, 3, 347–364.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L. (2009). Allophilia: Moving beyond tolerance in the classroom. Childhood Education, 85(4), 212–215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittinsky, T. L. (2009). Look both ways. Phi Delta Kappan, 90(5), 363–364.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allophilia predicts positive relationships with outgroup members. For instance, a study in Spain shows that students having higher allophilia had lower social distance toward people with obesity.&lt;ref&gt;Magallares, A. (2017). Predictors of Social Distance Toward People with Obesity: The Role of Allophilia. International Review of Social Psychology, 30(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, positive experience with outgroup members may increase allophilia, as it is shown in a longitudinal study of a cook's tour in Vietnam. In that study, the participants, who were Americans, reported positive feelings toward Vietnamese mirroring Allophilia facets in nearly 10 years after the event.&lt;ref&gt;Livert, D. (2016). A Cook's Tour Abroad: Long‐Term Effects of Intergroup Contact on Positive Outgroup Attitudes. Journal of Social Issues, 72(3), 524-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, [[mudita|symhedonia]] (experiencing empathic joy) has been shown to be more closely associated with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) has been shown to be more strongly associated with prejudice.&lt;ref name="ref3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5909">'''Barbara Rose, Ph.D''' (born 1938) is an American [[art historian]] and [[art critic]]. She was educated at [[Smith College]], [[Barnard College]] and [[Columbia University]], where she studied under [[Meyer Schapiro]]. She also studied at [[New York University Institute of Fine Arts]] with Walter W.S. Cook. Through [[Michael Chapman (cinematographer)]], Rose was introduced to many New York artists, including [[Carl Andre]] and [[Frank Stella]]. In 1961, Rose received a Fulbright to Spain. Stella joined her in Europe and the two were married in 1961 in London. They divorced in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Dictionary of Art Historians |title=Barbara Rose |publisher= |last=Sorenson |first=Lee |url=https://dictionaryofarthistorians.org/roseb.htm |accessdate=2015-07-31 |date=November 27, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the encouragement of [[Michael Fried]] Rose began writing art criticism, which, in 1963, led to a monthly "New York Letter" in [[Art International]]. In October 1965, Rose published the essay '''ABC Art''' in [[Art in America]], in which she described the fundamental characteristics of [[minimal art]].

==ABC Art==
In her essay, ''ABC Art'', Rose considers the diverse roots of [[minimalism]] in the work of [[Kasimir Malevich]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] as well as the choreography of [[Merce Cunningham]], the art criticism of [[Clement Greenberg|Greenberg]], the philosophy of [[Wittgenstein]] and the novels of [[Robbe-Grillet]]. In examining the historical roots of [[minimal art]] in 1960s America, Rose draws a distinction between [[Malevich]]'s "search for the transcendental, universal, absolute" and [[Duchamp]]'s "blanket denial of the existence of absolute values."

Rose grouped some 1960s artists as closer to [[Malevich]], some as closer to [[Duchamp]], and some as between the two. Closer to Malevich are [[Walter Darby Bannard]], [[Larry Zox]], Robert Huot, [[Lyman Kipp]], [[Richard Tuttle]], Jan Evans, Ronald Bladen, [[Anne Truitt]]. Closer to Duchamp are [[Richard Artschwager]] and [[Andy Warhol]]. Between Malevich and Duchamp she places [[Robert Morris (artist)|Robert Morris]], [[Donald Judd]], [[Carl Andre]], and [[Dan Flavin]]. Her conclusion is that [[minimal art]] is both [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] and negative:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The art I have been talking about is obviously a negative art of denial and renunciation. Such protracted asceticism is normally the activity of contemplatives or mystics...Like the mystic, in their work these artists deny the ego and the individual personality, seeking to evoke, it would seem, the semihypnotic state of blank unconsciousness."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She also contrasts [[minimal art]] with [[Pop Art]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...if Pop Art is the reflection of our environment, perhaps the art I have been describing is its antidote, even if it is a hard one to swallow."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Career==
From 1962 until 1965, Rose was a New York correspondent for Art International; a contributing editor at [[Art in America]] from 1965 through 1971; at [[Vogue (magazine)]] from 1966 until 1988; and at [[Artforum]] from 1965 until 1973. From 1970 until 1971, Rose served as the first director of the museum at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. She was also an art critic for [[New York (magazine)]] from 1971 until 1977, art editor at the [[Partisan Review]] from 1975 until 1996, associate editor at Arts magazine from 1978 until 1988, and editor-in-chief of the "Journal of Art" from 1988 through 1991. Rose served as a consultant to [[Condé Nast]] from 1970 until 1987 and to the GSA Art in Architecture program from 1990 to 1992. From 1981 until 1985, Rose held the position of senior curator at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] where she curated shows including "Miró in America" in 1982 and "
Fernand Léger and the Modern Spirit: An Avant-Garde Alternative to Non-Objective Art," also in 1982. The [[College Art Association]] of America awarded Rose the Distinguished Art Criticism Award in 1966 and 1969. Rose's books include "American Art Since 1900" (1967); "The Golden Age of Dutch Painting" (1969); "Lee Krasner" (1983); and "Autocritique: Essays on Art and Anti-Art" (1989). She has also published countless catalogue essays, produced eight films, and curated museum exhibitions. Rose was the senior curator at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Houston]] from 1981 and 1985 and the founding director of the [[Katzen Arts Center]] at [[American University]]. 

Rose is also credited with popularizing the term [[Neo-Dada]].

[[File:Samoa beach fale 2009.jpg|thumb|A Samoan beach fale]]

A '''beach fale''' is a simple thatched hut in [[Samoa]]. Beach fales are also common in other parts of [[Polynesia]]. They have become popular in [[tourism]] as a low budget accommodation situated by the coast, built with a few posts, no walls and a thatched roof with a round or oval shape.

The word ''fale'' (pronounced fah-leh) is the Samoan word for any type of building. A similar word is used in other [[Polynesian language]]s, similar to [[whare]] in the [[Maori language]].

In [[Architecture of Samoa|Samoan architecture]], these simple huts are called ''faleo'o'' in the [[Samoan language]]. They are common in villages where they provide extra storage or space for [[dragon boat]]s.

As the term denotes, beach fale are usually located around the coast in villages.  In Samoa, renting out a beach fale to visitors is a common means for providing extra income for families.&lt;ref&gt;Samoa Tourism Authority, {{cite web

In comparison to beach fale, this is a large traditional Samoan house, ''fale tele'' which serves as a meeting house or guest house.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6380">Being '''bedridden''' is a form of immobility that can present as the inability to move or even sit upright.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bedridden|title=Definition of BEDRIDDEN|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from bed-rest, a form of non-invasive treatment that is usually part of recovery or the limitation of activities. Some of the more serious consequences of being bedridden is the high risk of developing [[Thrombosis prevention|thrombosis]] and [[Muscle atrophy|muscle wasting]] (atrophy). Its meaning is derived from a middle English term (bedrid) from a 1300s past tense form of riding a bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/bedridden|title=The definition of bedridden|last=|first=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Complications ==
Being bedridden leads to many complications such as loss of muscle strength and endurance. Contractures, osteoporosis from disuse and the degeneration of joints can occur. Being confined to bed can add to the likelihood of developing an increased heart rate, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, and thromboembolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maclin|first=V.

The ability to transfer to a chair and the negative attitudes of caregivers is associated with continued confinement to bed and reduction of such requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Forbes|first=Dorothy A.|date=2009-04-01|title=Being bedridden was a slow process influenced by interactions with the environment, nurses, and social tiesCommentary|url=http://ebn.bmj.com/content/12/2/64.1|journal=Evidence-Based Nursing|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=64–64|doi=10.1136/ebn.12.2.64|issn=1367-6539|pmid=19321841}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are confined to bed have risks related to falls. Falling from a bed can result in injury.

== Prevention ==
One recommendation for preventing the complications of being bedridden is to eat a healthy, well-balanced diet that contains enough calories and protein needed for optimum health. If someone is confined to bed changing position at least every two hours can help prevent complications in addition to change sheeting and bedclothes immediately if they are soiled, and using items that can help reduce pressure, such as pillows or foam padding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Studies ==
One [[India]]n study of care given to bedridden individuals at home found that family members made up 82% of [[caregivers]]. A high rate of [[Complication (medicine)|medical complications]] was reported, including [[pressure ulcers]] and [[urinary tract infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile of home-based caregivers of bedridden patients in North India|url=http://ijcm.org.in/article.asp?issn=0970-0218;year=2011;volume=36;issue=2;spage=114;epage=119;aulast=Bains|author=Puneet Bains|author2=Amarjeet Singh Minhas|publisher=[[Indian Journal of Community Medicine]]|date=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carl F. Bucherer''' is a Swiss ''[[Manufacture d'horlogerie|haute horlogerie]]'' company based in [[Lucerne]], [[Switzerland]], which manufactures luxury men's and women's mechanical watches. Since its founding in 1888, the company has been wholly owned by the Bucherer family, making Carl F. Bucherer one of the oldest luxury Swiss watchmakers continuously held by the founding family. The company is run by the original family's third generation, with Jörg G. Bucherer serving as chairman of the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date= |title=Carl F. Bucherer: Tradition combined with innovative strength |url=http://www.watchoogle.com/tradition-combined-with-innovative-strength/ |agency=Watchoogle }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The watch models of Carl F. Bucherer can be distinguished by certain functions including the [[chronograph]], [[Flyback chronograph|flyback]], [[Tachymeter (watch)|tachymeter]], [[tourbillon]] as well as indicators and displays such as big date and day, power reserve, 24 hours, moon phases, three time zones, calendar, and [[perpetual calendar]].&lt;ref name="manufacturer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carl-f-bucherer.com/en/swiss-watch-manufacturer |title=Swiss watch manufacturer |date= |publisher=Carl F. Bucherer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Carl Friedrich Bucherer Clockmaker.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;Carl Friedrich Bucherer, founder of the Swiss watch manufacturer.&lt;/small&gt;]]
In 1888, Carl Friedrich Bucherer established his first boutique selling watches and jewelry in Lucerne, Switzerland. In 1919, Carl Friedrich Bucherer launched his first ladies’ watch collection in the [[art deco]] style. He is one of the first watchmakers to adopt the watch strap, which at the time was still a revolutionary concept. By 1948, the company was focusing on sporty chronographs that prominently displayed the current date.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carl-f-bucherer.com/en/lucerne-1888 |title=Made of Lucerne Since 1888  |date= |publisher=Carl F. Bucherer }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Carl F. Bucherer boutique.jpg|thumb|left|100px|&lt;small&gt;Carl Friedrich Bucherer's first boutique in Lucerne, Switzerland.&lt;/small&gt;]]
By 1968, Carl F. Bucherer had manufactured around 15,000 high-precision, certified [[chronometer watch|chronometers]], making the company one of the top three Swiss producers of these specialized timepieces. In 1969, the company became part of a Swiss consortium for the development and production of the first quartz [[Movement (clockwork)|movement]] for wristwatches, the Beta 21.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 1976, Jörg G. Bucherer, the third generation of the family, took over the company. In 2001, the Carl F. Bucherer brand was [[Positioning (marketing)|repositioned]] and the company launched the Patravi watch collection. In 2005, the company filed a patent for the monopusher mechanism of the Patravi TravelTec watch, which permits the parallel display of three time zones.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

In 2007, Carl F. Bucherer acquired Téchniques Horlogères Appliquées of [[Sainte-Croix, Switzerland]] and incorporated it into the company as Carl F. Bucherer Technologies. The acquisition enables the company to research, develop, and produce its own manufacture movements and modules for additional functions. This leads in the following year to the company's launch of the CFB A1000 manufacture movement, which features a peripheral motor.&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://issuu.com/carlfbucherer/docs/cfb_collection_2014-2015_en |title=Collection 2014/15 |date= |publisher=Carl F. Bucherer }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Manero PowerReserve becomes the first Carl F. Bucherer model to receive a unique laser signature in order to ensure product authenticity and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carl-f-bucherer.com/en/news/manero-powerreserve-0 |title=Manero PowerReserve |date=16 May 2014 |publisher=Carl F.

==Production==
[[File:Carl F. Bucherer Women's Wristwatch.jpg|thumb|&lt;small&gt;The first Carl F. Bucherer ladies' wristwatch, from 1919.&lt;/small&gt;]]
In order to increase its production capacity, Carl F. Bucherer moved its production workshops from [[Nidau]] to a larger production site in [[Lengnau, Bern]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 November 2004 |title=Carl F.

Bucherer announced that its manufacturing will be consolidated to a new factory in Lengnau in order to optimize production processes and its [[Value chain|value-added chain]], as well as increase the scope of [[Vertical integration|vertical manufacturing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 August 2015 |title=Carl F Bucherer - Établissement d'un centre de compétences à Lengnau |url= |newspaper=Journal de Sainte-Croix et environs }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=4 July 2016 |title=Carl F.

The company currently sells about 25,000 watches a year (around 60% men, 40% women) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 August 2015 |title=In Conversation With Sascha Moeri, CEO, Carl F. Bucherer    |url=http://luxurysociety.com/articles/2015/08/in-conversation-with-sascha-moeri-ceo-carl-f-bucherer |agency=Luxury Society }}&lt;/ref&gt; The price range varies between CHF 5,000 and CHF 30,000 with some exception over CHF 400,000. The world market is divided between Europe with 40%, Asia also 40% and rest of the world, including US market with 20%. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cfb-communication.com Official Facts and Figures 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==In-house manufacture movement==
[[File:CFB A2000 Caliber Watch Movement.png|thumb|150px|left|&lt;small&gt;The CFB A2000 caliber manufacture movement.&lt;/small&gt;]]
The CFB A1000 caliber has the first reliably functioning, peripherally-mounted rotor, which is made of [[tungsten]].&lt;ref name="collection"/&gt; The peripheral rotor provides power when turning in either direction and allows for full visual display of the movement.&lt;ref name="manufacturer"/&gt; The A1000 movement includes the patented "Dynamic Shock Absorption" (DSA) system for effective shock absorption.&lt;ref name="collection"/&gt;
[[File:Manero Peripheral.jpg|thumb|150px|&lt;small&gt;The 2016 Manero Peripheral model, marking the launch of the CFB A2000 movement family.&lt;/small&gt;]]
At [[BaselWorld]] 2016, Carl F. Bucherer introduced the CFB A2000 manufacture movement. The A2000 retains the A1000 caliber's signature winding mechanism but is enhanced from a 3[[Hertz|hz]] to a 4Hz beat rate "for increased precision and a newly free-sprung balance for increased resistance to shock-induced timing deviation." The A2000 has the [[COSC]] Swiss Chronometer certification to attest to its high-level performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 March 2016 |title=Carl F.

Carl F. Bucherer's new Manero Peripheral model, also introduced at BaselWorld 2016, is driven by the CFB A2000-based CFB A2050 caliber. This watch marks the launch of the CFB A2000 movement family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 March 2016 |title=BaselWorld 2016: Carl F.

==Authentication==
As of 2014, the company's manufacture movements have been protected against [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeiting]] by special laser technology. Developed by the Swiss company Mimotec SA, the CLR-[[LIGA]] process imprints a unique signature on the surface of the watch movement using diffractive nano-structuring that can then only be authenticated with a specialized laser scanning device.&lt;ref name="clr-liga"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mimotec.ch/anglais/Product/contrefa%C3%A7on.html |title=Say ''STOP'' to counterfeiting… |date= |publisher=Mimotec SA |access-date=2015-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930051836/http://www.mimotec.ch/anglais/Product/contrefa%C3%A7on.html# |archive-date=2015-09-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 movie [[Deadpool 2]] the character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], a time-travelling soldier played by [[Josh Brolin]], uses a time-machine on his wrist to move through time. In close-ups of the device it is inscribed with the Carl F. Bucherer name and logo suggesting that, far in the future where Cable originates, the watchmaker produces wearable time pieces that can manipulate time itself.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1487">'''Chehel Minbari''' is a special tradition practiced in [[Iran|Iran's]] western [[Lorestān Province]], in which thousands of women commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Imam Hussein]].

Women from cities and towns across Lorestān Province cover their faces completely with black cloth and walk in silence as they knock on the doors of 40 houses and light candles in 40 spots as mourners beat their chests in their grief over the suffering and martyrdom of Imam Hussein along with 72 of his loyal companions in [[Karbala]] in [[southern Iraq]], in 680 CE. 

The Chehel Minbari tradition is upheld every year on Tasu'a (which is on the 9th of [[Muharram]]), as a show of solidarity with the sister of Imam Hussein, [[Zaynab bint Ali|Hazrat Zainab]]. Shia mourners throughout the world gather on Tasu'a to commemorate the martyrdom anniversary of Imam Hussein. 

The Chehel Minbari ritual starts after participants have said their dawn prayers and ends at dusk prayers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10750">'''Confession inscriptions of [[Lydia]] and [[Phrygia]]''' are Roman-era [[Koine Greek]] religious [[stele]]s from these historical regions of [[Anatolia]] (then part of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]]  provinces), dating mostly to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.

The new element that appears, the public [[Confession (religion)|confession]] of sin and the [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through offerings (lytra), unknown to traditional [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], has made scholars to name this social phenomenon as oriental. The religious thought and the use of vernacular Koine Greek, full of innovative orthography,syntax and grammar, suggests that they may also represent something at the root of religion in Phrygia and Lydia.&lt;ref&gt;Angels and Principalities: The Background, Meaning and Development of the Pauline Phrase hai archai kai hai exousiai A. Wesley Carr [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cnjptnn7EjEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Phrygia+Lydia++inscriptions+oriental+confession#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Page 56] {{ISBN|0-521-23429-8}} (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Marijana Ricl has argued that the practice of confession is a reminiscence of [[Hittite religion]]. According to Schnabel E.J  it was a counter-move prompted by the increasing success of the Christian missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Deutungen des Todes Jesu im neuen Testament edited by Jörg Frey, Jens Schröter [https://books.google.com/books?id=upHACoCciKQC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=a+counter-move+prompted+by+the+increasing+success+of+the+Christian+missionaries#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20counter-move%20prompted%20by%20the%20increasin Page 292] {{ISBN|3-16-148581-5}}  (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, beside the scheme of confession/redemption, phraseology and terms remind of Greek [[New Testament]]: [[hamartia]] (sin), [[paraclete|parakletos]] (advocator), [[Slavery in antiquity|doulos]] tou theou (slave of god), [[kyrios]] (master), [[basileus]] (king). Another point for discussion is the punishment of sexual transgressions, which further relates the inscriptions to Christianity and the concept of [[chastity]] in [[:Category:Hellenistic philosophy and religion|Hellenistic philosophy and religion]]; in contrast to the previous perception of sexuality inside the religion ([[Hieros gamos]], [[Sacred prostitution]], [[Aphrodite Pandemos]]).

Some indicating names or epithets of deities engaged in the inscriptions are: [[Men (god)|Men]] (Axiottenos, Artemidoros),  Meter  (mother), [[Zeus]] (Aithrios, Keraunios, Soter), [[Apollo]], [[Hypsistos]], [[Anaitis]], [[Attis]], [[Dionysos]], Hades, [[Herakles]], [[Sabazios]], Batenos, [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Asclepius]], Tyrannos, Basileus, Theos Strapton and Bronton, [[Hecate]], [[Artemis]] etc.

*GOD: I punished Theodoros on his eyes for the sins he committed.
*THEODOROS: I had sex with Trophime, the slave of Haplokomas, &lt;br/&gt;wife of Eutyches in the courtyard&lt;ref&gt;(Koine Greek: pletorin from [[praetorium]])&lt;/ref&gt;

See monaulia in [[LSJ]], it means either [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3D%2368457 solo on the flute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202133428/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D |date=2009-12-02 }} or [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3D%2368458 celibacy] &lt;/ref&gt;

*THEODOROS: Third sin. I had sex with Arethusa, the monaulia.
*GOD: He takes aways with a chicken, sparrow, pigeon, &lt;br/&gt; a kypros&lt;ref&gt;a measure of corn , [http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry%3D%2361018 LSJ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202133428/http://old.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D |date=2009-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of barley and wheat, a  chamber-pot (prochos) of wine, &lt;br/&gt;a kypros of clean wheat for the priests, one prochos.

*ZEUS: Look! I have blinded him for his sins.But since he has appeased the gods &lt;br/&gt;and written down his sins on this [[stele]],he takes salvation.&lt;br/&gt;Asked by the senate,&lt;ref&gt;In original, ''synkletos'' the Greek word for the Roman senate&lt;/ref&gt; I am merciful because my stele was erected on the day I appointed. &lt;br/&gt;You may open the jail, I set the convict free,  a year and ten months passing.

According to George Petzl, a trial of sacred theatre did take place in the sanctuary; Theodoros was convicted and jailed. Zeus was impersonated by a priest. According to Ender Varinlioglu ''phylake'' jail is used metaphorically. Blindness was the jail/punishment upon Theodoros in order to be salvated from his ''licentious sexual activities''.&lt;ref&gt;The Greco-Roman East: politics, culture, society By Stephen Colvin [https://books.google.com/books?id=y0z0Vd3ZJugC&amp;pg=RA1-PA28&amp;dq=Haplokomas#v=onepage&amp;q=Haplokomas&amp;f=false Page 28] {{ISBN|0-521-82875-9}}  (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Crossing Borders: Personal Essays''''' is a collection of essays by [[Sergio Troncoso]] first published in [[2011 in literature|2011]] by [[Arte Público Press]]. The book of sixteen personal essays explores how Troncoso made the leap from growing up poor along the [[Mexico-U.S. border]] to the Ivy League, his wife's battle against breast cancer, his struggles as a writer in New York and Texas, fatherhood, and interfaith marriage.

==Summary and Main Themes==
“On good days I feel I am a bridge. On bad days I just feel alone,” Sergio Troncoso writes in this collection of personal essays in which he seeks to connect the humanity of his Mexican family to people he meets on the East Coast, including his wife’s Jewish kin. Raised in a home steps from the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas, Troncoso crossed what seemed an even more imposing border when he left home to attend Harvard College.

Initially, “outsider status” was thrust upon him; later, he adopted it willingly, writing about the Southwest and Chicanos in an effort to communicate who he was and where he came from to those unfamiliar with his childhood world. He wrote to maintain his ties to his parents and his abuelita, and to fight against the elitism he experienced at an Ivy League school. “I was torn,” he writes, “between the people I loved at home and the ideas I devoured away from home.”

Troncoso writes to preserve his connections to the past, but he puts pen to paper just as much for the future. In his three-part essay entitled “Letter to My Young Sons,” he documents the terror of his wife’s breast cancer diagnosis and the ups and downs of her surgery and treatment. Other essays convey the joys and frustrations of fatherhood, his uneasy relationship with his elderly father, and the impact his wife’s Jewish heritage and religion have on his Mexican-American identity.

''Crossing Borders: Personal Essays'' reveals a writer, father and husband who has crossed linguistic, cultural and intellectual borders to provoke debate about contemporary Mexican-American identity.  Challenging assumptions about literature, the role of writers in America, fatherhood and family, these essays bridge the chasm between the poverty of the border region and the highest echelons of success in America. Troncoso writes with the deepest faith in humanity about sacrifice, commitment and honesty.

==Content==
;"Crossing Borders"
: Troncoso explores the relationship between Latinos and Jews, and interfaith marriage.

; "Literature and Migration"
: The author adopts an outsider status to write from a new perspective in fiction and writes simply to combat abstractions and also to communicate complex ideas to a broader community.

;"Fresh Challah"
: Dolores Rivero, Troncoso's abuelita, taught him to fight for what is right, as well as to be self-critical, which helped him to appreciate Judaism.

; "Letter to my Young Sons-Part One"
: The author's wife is diagnosed with breast cancer, and with two young children the couple struggles with their emotions and scrambles to understand the diagnosis.

; "Letter to my Young Sons-Part Two"
: Laura's day for surgery arrives, and she endures seven hours of procedures. Her parents arrive from Boston. A week after the surgery, the author and his wife receive startling news.

; "Letter to my Young Sons-Part Three"
: Laura returns home and perseveres through the pain, with their young children nearby. She undergoes aggressive chemotherapy and radiation treatment, while Troncoso helps her to recover.

; "A Day Without Ideas"
: The ideas for stories are everywhere if we can resist seeing the world without curiosity.

; "Latinos Find an America on the Border of Acceptance"
: The author reflects on the acceptance of the Latino culture in the U.S and discusses the Euro-centric view on various topics including economics, politics and philosophy. The focus should be on the poor immigrants in the U.S. who struggle against poverty, racism and language barriers.

; "The Father Is in the Details"
: Troncoso writes about fatherhood on the [[Upper West Side]] of [[New York City]], and the daily effort to create a nurturing, yet challenging environment for his children.

; "Terror and Humanity"
: Written on [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]], this powerful editorial appeared the next day in [[Newsday]]. The author details the philosophical links between hatred and abstraction, and how to combat this hatred as he expresses sympathy for the victims of terrorism.

; "Trapped"
: Troncoso writes about fighting to find time for his literary work amid his busy life, while knowing that his obligations as a father and husband are vital to him.

; "Apostate of my Literary Family"
: The author writes about his experiences as a board member of the Hudson Valley Writers' Center in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York]].

; "This Wicked Patch of Dust"
: A fight with his father in [[Ysleta, El Paso, Texas|Ysleta]] reveals the complex family relationships that shaped the author, including the identification with his mother as a curious reader.

; "Chico Lingo Days"
: Troncoso includes several entries from his blog, Chico Lingo, about xenophobia against Latino immigrants in New York, Latino writers in Texas, his mother as his heroine, and the solitary life of the writer.

; "Finding our Voice-From Literacy to Literature"
: Troncoso delivers the White Fund Lecture in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] on February 25, 2010. The author examines the immigrant values that helped him succeed in the Ivy League and beyond, and how to translate those values to places beyond the border.

; "Why Should Latinos Write Their Own Stories?"
: The point of writing stories should be not only to preserve cultural heritage, but also to challenge it.

==Literary significance &amp; criticism==
A reviewer from the ''Portland Book Review'' wrote in a four-starred review: "''Crossing Borders'' is a series of personal essays by author Sergio Troncoso that bring you into his family and his personal growth. Troncoso writes about crossing personal, religious, and cultural borders, as well as literal borders, and brings the reader into experiences they are not likely to have on their own. ''Crossing Borders'' is a book the reader will get invested in, if only to learn more about the family being talked about in the essays. Most heart-wrenching are the three pieces entitled “Letter to My Young Sons,” which details their mother’s battle with cancer and shows a father’s love for his children. If a reader only reads one essay, though, it should be “Why Should Latinos Write Their Own Stories,” a piece that shows the importance of preserving heritage and teaching the world things that they may not know about Latinos. In all, Troncoso’s book is a piece of artwork and a piece of heritage that everyone, not just Latinos, should take the time to read." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =Crossing Borders: Personal Essays | journal=Portland Book Review | year=2012 | issue=22 August }}&lt;/ref&gt;

----A reviewer from the ''[[El Paso Times]]'' wrote: "Sergio Troncoso's ''Crossing Borders: Personal Essays'' is an engrossing and revealing peek behind the curtain of one writer's creative process, development and struggles.

The reader is treated to crisp and evocative prose that wades into the murky waters of ethnic, religious and familial identities….

In three heartbreaking interconnected essays, "Letter to my Young Sons (Parts One, Two and Three)," he begins: "Two weeks ago, Aaron and Isaac, I learned your mother Laura has breast cancer." We are plunged into the world of surgical options, chemotherapy and physical therapy. Troncoso skillfully and in exquisite detail allows us the privilege of entering into his world as the disease affects not only his wife but also all who love her.

The fact that Troncoso's beloved wife is Jewish imbues many of these essays with a sense of wonder and appreciation of a religion and culture vastly different from the Mexican Catholicism of his youth. In "Fresh Challah," we learn of his newfound love for the traditional Jewish bread, which he can find in his favorite New York bakeries: "The loaves of Challah glistened under the bright white light, and seemed soft and steamy from the other side of the cash register." Troncoso brilliantly uses challah as a springboard for an exploration of his El Paso roots as embodied by his late grandmother, Doña Dolores Rivero….

Troncoso has already made his mark in the literary world. But if ''Crossing Borders'' is any guide, he will continue to spin stories and explain the writer's life for many years to come." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Essays from an Outsider |  journal=The El Paso Times | year=2011 |issue=4 December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

----''Crossing Borders: Personal Essays'' won the Bronze Award for Essays from ''ForeWord Reviews'', and Second Place for Best Biography in English in the International Latino Book Awards. ''The Hispanic Reader'' chose it as one of the best books of 2011.

'''''DmC: Devil May Cry''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[hack and slash]] [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Ninja Theory]] and published by [[Capcom]] for [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]] and [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is a [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the ''Devil May Cry'' series. Announced in late 2010 during the [[Tokyo Game Show]], the game is set in an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate reality]] to the mainline ''[[Devil May Cry]]'' series.

The game's story focuses on the [[player character]] [[Dante (Devil May Cry)|Dante]], a young man at the start of his saga. Dante is a Nephilim: half-angel, half-demon. He is partnered with his twin brother, Vergil, and is on a quest to kill the Demon King Mundus, who murdered their mother and condemned their father to banishment. Players can use Dante's iconic sword, Rebellion, and signature handguns, Ebony and Ivory, as well as a variety of other melee weapons and firearms to defeat enemies. The game also introduces Angel Mode and Demon Mode, which are modifiers to Dante's moveset.

The re-imagination of the ''Devil May Cry'' series was requested by Capcom, resulting in a total reboot. Capcom chose Ninja Theory to develop the game, assisting them to ensure that gameplay was reminiscent, but distinct, compared to previous titles. Early reaction to the game was widely negative, generally as a result of Dante's visual redesign; nevertheless, ''DmC'' received positive reviews from critics upon release, but less favorable reception among fans. Critics praised the gameplay, art style, and story of the game, as well as the redesigned Dante. The game ultimately failed to meet Capcom's sales expectations.

A [[Downloadable content|DLC]] expansion for the game, titled ''Vergil's Downfall'', which takes place after the main game and features Dante's brother Vergil as the playable character, was released on 23 March 2013. A remastered edition of the full game, titled ''DmC: Definitive Edition'', running at 1080p/60fps and including all downloadable content, new costumes and new gameplay features such as a manual targeting system, was released for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on 10 March 2015. The ''Definitive Edition'' and the original PC version were developed by [[Q-LOC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Makuch|first=Eddie|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/devil-may-cry-pc-port-outsourced/1100-6396854/ |title=Devil May Cry PC port outsourced |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date= |accessdate=20 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using Angel mode allows Dante to pull himself towards enemies and various points in each level, whilst Devil mode lets Dante pull enemies and objects towards him. Dante is also able to dash across large gaps in Angel mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2012/12/14/defying-the-devil-in-dmc/21052/|title=Defying The Devil In DmC|first=Steve|last=Hannley|work=[[Hardcore Gamer]]|date=14 December 2012|accessdate=7 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these moves can be used in conjunction with each other to perform massive combos, which are ranked based on the damage the player makes.

==Plot==
{{see also|Characters of Devil May Cry}}
The game is set in an alternate reality of the series.&lt;ref name="Parallel world"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/10/31/dmc-devil-may-cry-takes-place-in-a-parallel-world-with-a-different-dante/ |title=DmC Devil May Cry Takes Place In A Parallel World With A Different Dante |publisher=Siliconera |date=31 October 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's story takes place in Limbo City, a modern-day city secretly controlled by all-powerful demons, manipulating humanity through the comforts of life, with the demons themselves residing in a parallel plane called '[[Limbo]]'. Living on the fringes of the brainwashed society is Dante, a young man at odds with the demons who constantly hunt him, and the civilian authorities they control. Dante is warned by a young woman named Kat that he is in danger just as a Hunter demon drags him into Limbo. Dante navigates the Bellevue Pier's carnival and kills the demon with Kat's aid, who can see into Limbo with her psychic powers. Dante returns to the human world and accepts Kat's offer to meet with her boss, Vergil.

Along the way, Kat explains that Vergil leads "The Order", a rogue vigilante organisation intent on exposing the demons and releasing the world from their control. Vergil tells Dante that with his help the Order can bring down the demons. Dante learns that he and Vergil are not only long lost twin brothers but also [[Nephilim]], the children of Angel and Demon and the only beings capable of killing the cruel demon king [[Characters of Devil May Cry#Mundus|Mundus]]. Their demon father Sparda was Mundus' chief lieutenant in the war against the angels until he betrayed Mundus when he fell in love with the angel Eva and sired the twins. Mundus, afraid of the Nephilim, attacked the family and killed Eva. Sparda spirited his sons to safety, wiped their memories for their own protection and gave each a sword (Rebellion for Dante, Yamato for Vergil). Mundus imprisoned Sparda and condemned him to eternal torture and has hunted Dante ever since. After learning of his past, Dante resolves to help Vergil bring down Mundus and his regime.

Dante, with help from Kat, gradually takes down Mundus' operations. During the final stages of his campaign, Dante witnesses a SWAT team raid the Order's headquarters, killing everyone in sight. Dante rescues Vergil from Limbo but he is helpless to protect Kat from being brutally beaten and dragged back to Mundus' lair. Dante then kidnaps [[Lilith]], Mundus' demon concubine carrying Mundus' unborn child, and offers to trade her to Mundus for Kat. During the exchange, Vergil kills Lilith, her child and the SWAT troops. The three allies narrowly escape as Mundus tears much of city apart in an outburst of power that depletes the Hellgate, a portal to the demon world within his stronghold in Silver Sacks Tower. Kat, recovering from her injuries, leads the brothers through a detailed plan to infiltrate the Towers and defeat Mundus. Dante draws Mundus out of his lair and Vergil closes the Hellgate, rendering Mundus mortal. Mundus forms a massive body for himself and confronts the brothers, but Dante lands the killing blow to destroy Mundus for good. Limbo collapses into the human world, making demons visible to humans and creating chaos and pandemonium worldwide.

After Mundus' defeat, Vergil reveals his true intentions: with their family avenged, he intends to rule humanity in Mundus' place. Vergil argues that as their saviours, they must protect humans "from themselves" yet he callously dismisses the human Kat's role in saving humanity. Dante is appalled at Vergil's attitude and defeats him in a climactic sword fight. Kat stops Dante from killing his brother and Vergil leaves in disgrace. Faced with a world now infested with demons and abandoned by his own brother, Dante questions his own identity, and Kat comforts him by claiming that he is "Dante, nothing more and nothing less".

The DLC chapter ''Vergil's Downfall'' follows Vergil after escaping from Dante. He finds himself in an unknown dimension, where he is guided by the voice of Eva to "head toward the lights". Vergil reaches the light area but is stopped by illusions of Kat and Dante, the latter of whom stabs him again. Vergil is saved by a hollow version of himself and is transported to an area where he has to fight to heal his wounds. During his journey Vergil kills the illusions to heal his wounds, and leaves Eva to mourn after discovering what a monster he has chosen to become. Vergil later defeats his hollow counterpart and takes his amulet. Vergil then returns to the real world and encounters demons, who begin to bow at his feet.  Confident in his future, Vergil becomes the new Demon King and leads his new army to the unknown.

Although their previous game, ''[[Devil May Cry 4]]'', was a commercial success the staff thought about rebooting the series taking into account how other game series had better sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2010-09-22-dmc-devil-may-cry-interview |title=DmC: Devil May Cry|publisher=Eurogamer |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They chose Ninja Theory, impressed with their work on ''[[Heavenly Sword]]'' which the staff thought would work with a ''Devil May Cry'' game.&lt;ref name="xbuttoninter"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2012-10-17|title=The X Button In the Details|publisher=Anime News Network |date=17 October 2012 |accessdate=17 October 2012|author=Ciolek, Todd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ninja Theory's creative director Tameem Antoniades stated that ''DmC''{{'}}s system would contain mechanics that would set him apart from other action titles, in particularly ''[[Bayonetta]]'', developed by [[PlatinumGames]] and directed by the creator of ''Devil May Cry'', [[Hideki Kamiya]]. Lead producer Alex Jones stated they still wanted to compete with Platinum in terms of gameplay and storytelling. The idea of a town being alive that wishes to kill the player was added a new element never seen before in the ''Devil May Cry'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Minkley, Johnny|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-01-05-capcom-ninja-theory-on-dmc-versus-bayonetta|title=Capcom, Ninja Theory on DmC versus Bayonetta |publisher=Eurogamer|date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actions of Limbo Town are inspired by previous ''Devil May Cry'' games, where the environments would close whenever Dante was surrounded by enemies.&lt;ref name="ignuk" /&gt; Combat designer Rahni Tucker commented on how newcomers to the series have difficulties understanding how advance players from the classic ''Devil May Cry'' games could perform several combos that combined multiple skills and weapons. As a result, she designed the combat to be appeal to newcomers so that they could easily perform elaborated combos, while still offering gameplay that advance players would enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Evans, Edwin|url=http://www.oxm.co.uk/48901/new-devil-may-cry-will-teach-casuals-the-magic-of-pro-gaming-entry-bar-is-very-low/|title=New Devil May Cry will teach casuals the "magic" of pro gaming, entry bar "is very low" |publisher=OXM|date=4 January 2012 |accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the game was finished as of April 2012 with Capcom aiding Ninja Theory in tweaking few aspects for the final product. Capcom became heavily involved in the combat system to ensure the character's responsive moves and add new air combos never seen before in the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/04/16/capcom-giving-ninja-theory-frame-by-frame-guidance-on-dmc-devil-may-cry/|title=Capcom Giving Ninja Theory Frame By Frame Guidance On DmC Devil May Cry|publisher=Siliconera|date=16 April 2012|accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development team included over ninety members with nearly ten of them being from Capcom. While Capcom's [[Hideaki Itsuno]] oversaw the project, Jones and Motohide Eshiro acted as producers.

''DmC: Devil May Cry'' received "generally favorable" reviews, according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCPC /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt;

The game's story received positive responses from critics. Jose Otero from [[1UP.com]] thought that the story successfully combined with the game's gameplay. In addition, he praised the quality of the game's well-directed cutscenes.&lt;ref name="1Up"/&gt; Ryan  Clements from [[IGN]] considered the game's storytelling a refinement for the series. However, he criticised the length of the game's campaign, which he thought was too short.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Ryan Taljonick from [[GamesRadar]] criticised the game's campaign as he called it "predictible". He considered it a missed opportunity for ''DmC''.&lt;ref name="Gradar"/&gt;

The game's gameplay also received positive responses. Otero called the combat flexible, and thought that the developer had created a lot of memorable levels and stages with the use of Limbo.&lt;ref name="1Up"/&gt; Rich Stanton from [[Eurogamer]] praised the flow of combat, and thought that the use of the Rebellion in the game "an awesome achievement". Despite that, he criticised the platforming section of the game, which he found boring. He further criticised the design of the game's boss battles, which he thought, was very disappointing.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; Clements thought that the game's combat system was the "most intelligent design to date", in which he praised the game's simple user interface and combo system. Despite that, he criticised the game's camera, which he thought had failed to catch up with the combat.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Juba praised the game's combat variety and accessible controls. He also thought that the game's gameplay significantly increases the replayability of the game.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt;

The game's art style received acclaim. Stantion thought that the game's art-style is striking to look at. Clements praised the game's visuals, which he described as "stunning".&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; Joe Juba from ''[[Game Informer]]'' also praised the game's artistic direction, and he thought that the game's visuals install a sense of unpleasantness and surrealism to the game's alternate universe.&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; The game's boss design was praised by Taljonick, but he expressed disappointment that these enemies are not fun to play with. In addition, he criticised the lack of enemy variety in the game.&lt;ref name="Gradar"/&gt;

Otero praised Ninja Theory for removing some of Dante's old and unappealing personalities, and making him a protagonist that is approachable for players. He described it as "a fresh and imaginative take on Dante".&lt;ref name="1Up"/&gt; Clements thought that the redesigned hero is more relatable for players.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Rich Stanton from [[Eurogamer]] is also positive about Dante's re-design, calling it one of the best reinventions of a character in gaming history.&lt;ref name="EuroG"/&gt; In contrast, Chris Schilling from VideoGamer.com was negative about the redesign, as he found the new Dante lacking some of the original's iconic features.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt;

With the announcement of [[Devil May Cry 5]], Producer Matt Walker reiterated that while Capcom is returning to the original series "...this isn’t a slight at Ninja Theory or DmC at all. We all love DmC.” Matt explains “Itsuno-san himself has explicitly stated that in his mind, DmC is just as important as any of the other titles in the series, and he’s just as proud of it.” Continuing, “That game had an amazing world all its own, that could only have been produced by the amazing artists and imaginations at Ninja Theory." &lt;ref&gt;https://www.vg247.com/2018/07/25/devil-may-cry-5-will-expand-combat-philosophies-established-dmc1-4/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sales===
Capcom initially hoped to ship 2 million copies by the end of its financial year; later, it revised its predictions to 1.2 million copies shipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2012/05/10/resident-evil-6-expected-to-sell-7-million-dmc-devil-may-cry-2-million/|title=Resident Evil 6 Expected To Sell 7 Million, DmC Devil May Cry 2 Million|work=Siliconera|date=10 May 2012|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-02-05-capcom-reduces-devil-may-cry-sales-target-by-800k|title=Capcom reduces Devil May Cry sales target by 800k|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=5 February 2013|accessdate=4 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons given by Capcom included a "delayed response to the expanding digital contents market," "insufficient coordination between the marketing and the game development divisions in overseas markets," and a "decline in quality due to excessive outsourcing", though whether or not any of the comments were applicable to ''DmC: Devil May Cry'' or Capcom itself was left ambiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/18/capcom-halves-forecast-blames-excessive-outsourcing|title=Capcom Halves Forecast, Blames "Excessive Outsourcing"|publisher=IGN|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=24 April 2013|author=Karmali, Luke}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The game sold 116,000 units in its first week in Japan and made the top spot in the charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/dmc-launch-sales-bust-in-japan-performs-worse-than-all-predecessors-17129|title=DmC Launch Sales Bust In Japan, Performs Worse Than All Predecessors - GameRevolution|date=24 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also reached the top spot in the UK's sales charts, though only made a third of the sales of ''Devil May Cry 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-21-uk-chart-dmc-devil-may-cry-horns-its-way-to-top-spot|title=UK chart: DmC Devil May Cry launch sales are just a third of Devil May Cry 4's|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2018, 2.4 million copies of the original version have been sold worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html|title=CAPCOM - Platinum Titles|publisher=[[Capcom]]|accessdate=2018-06-22|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170102231700/http://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/finance/million.html|archivedate=2 January 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom stated that the sales of the original game were "solid" but noted that the game did not catch Eastern gamers' attention and made less than its previous iteration, ''Devil May Cry 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/02/12/capcom-senior-vp-gives-insight-into-east-vs-west-decisions/|title=DmC Devil May Cry May Have Failed To Attract Casual Fans In Japan|publisher=Siliconera|accessdate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2013/05/08/resident-evil-6-sold-4-9-million-copies-last-year-dmc-devil-may-cry-posted-solid-sales/|title=Resident Evil 6 Sold 4.9 Million Copies Last Year, DmC Devil May Cry "Posted Solid Sales"|date=8 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom reported in September 2015 that the company was "very happy" with the sales of the Definitive Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/09/05/capcom-talks-resident-evil-hd-ps4/|title=Capcom "Extremely Happy" With Resident Evil HD PS4 Sales on PSN|date=5 September 2015|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''doll hat''' (sometimes '''doll's hat''') is a women's millinery design scaled down to suggest a hat that could be worn by a doll.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brooks Picken|first1=Mary|title=A Dictionary of Costume and Fashion: Historic and Modern|date=2010|publisher=Dover Publications|location=United States|isbn=0486402940|pages=98, 163|edition=1999|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CbOI4TCcnbQC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=Doll+hat+%2B+Mary+Picken&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=adtmlrNiFE&amp;sig=N_IWZxudiAG9BTm4N5ylz03Zk5w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0s-tVP2_H8evU7mkgtgC&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Doll%20hat%20%2B%20Mary%20Picken&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be of any design and is generally worn at the front of the head.&lt;ref name="HS Hat Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hat Shaper's Hat Dictionary|url=http://www.hatshapers.com/Hat%20DictionaryD_F.htm|website=hatshapers.com|publisher=Hat Shaper's|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hat is usually held in place with a band of fabric or elastic secured at the back of the head.&lt;ref name="Dictionary Brooks Picken"/&gt;

==Origins of the hat==
The doll hat had periods of popularity in both the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="VFG Walford"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walford|first1=Jonathan|title=History of Hats for Women: Halo Halo|url=http://vintagefashionguild.org/fashion-history/the-history-of-womens-hats/|website=vintagefashionguild.org|publisher=Vintage Fashion Guild|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an era of elaborate hairstyles and the hat was a decorative accessory rather than serving a practical function.
[[File:StateLibQld 1 126003 Mrs Prunella Marshall, Miss A.I.F., 1946.jpg|thumb|A 1946 version of the doll hat, also worn tilted forward on the head]]
Doll hats became popular again in the 1930s. A report in ''[[The Times]]'' in 1937 on the latest London millinery described a miniature bonnet as among the key introductions: "A hat that looks like a doll's hat has been made of Leghorn; the floral topknot of the evening translated, as it were, into daytime wear. It needs only ribbon strings to reproduce the young matron's bonnet of the Victorian era".&lt;ref name="The Times 47611"&gt;{{cite news|title=London Fashions: New Spring Hats|issue=47611|publisher=The Times|date=17 February 1937|ref=pg. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with earlier version of the hat, this was a decorative style suited to occasion wear. A fashion report in 1938 described an [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]]-style model of indigo blue feathers decorated with a winged bird as ideal for: "grander occasions or the theatre".&lt;ref name="The Times 48127"&gt;{{cite news|title=Shopping News in Brief|issue=48127|publisher=The Times|date=17 October 1938|ref=p. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, the paper reported a new fashion for vivid doll hats in fuchsia, violet or Florentine blue worn with all-black outfits. The paper added that when a black doll hat was chosen, it should have a contrasting veil in a bright shade such as blue or pink matched with the same hue in gloves or buttonhole.&lt;ref name="The Times 48153"&gt;{{cite news|title=Challenging the Supremacy of Black|issue=48153|publisher=The Times|date=16 November 1938|ref=pg. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of miniature hat continued into [[World War II]]. In the United States, the absence of imports from French milliners inspired American designers to innovate. Variations on the [[beret]], [[Bowler hat|bowler]] and [[boater]] were introduced – along with forward tilted miniature hats. Although American ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine warned its readers in 1941 that doll hat designs were: "definitely not for the unselfconfident", the design became very popular during the war years.&lt;ref name="As Seen In Vogue Delis Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Delis Hill|first1=Daniel|title=As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising|date=2007|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Texas, US|isbn=0896726169|page=170|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=millinery+designs+%2B+doll+hat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qzw95WVi6_&amp;sig=VvY9EpD-JIgjMiyaSDgbFC0HZZU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6tStVLnYGMyAUbeCgtgB&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=millinery%20designs%20%2B%20doll%20hat&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
While many versions of the doll hat replicated traditional straw hats in miniature, variations included scaled down [[Witch hat|witches' hats]] and [[Welsh hat]]s.&lt;ref name="The Times 48163"&gt;{{cite news|title=Round the shops: gift suggestions for Christmas|issue=48163|publisher=The Times|date=28 November 1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Drimolen''' Palaeocave System consists of a series of a terminal Pliocene to early [[Pleistocene]] [[hominin]]-bearing palaeocave fills located around {{convert|40|km}} north of [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], and about {{convert|6|km}} north of [[Sterkfontein]] in the [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[Cradle of Humankind]].&lt;ref name="HerriesMurszewski2018" /&gt;

==History of Research==
The site was discovered on 9 July 1992 by Dr Andre Keyser and he continued to direct excavations at the site until his death in 2010. On 21 October 1994 Dr Keyser discovered the DNH 7 (Eurydice) skull, the most complete ''Paranthropus robustus'' skull ever found.&lt;ref name="Keyser2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keyser|first=|date=2000|title=The Drimolen skull, the most complete australopithecine cranium and mandible to date|journal=South African Journal of Science|volume=96|pages=189–197 |url= http://servicios.educarm.es/admin/portal/templates/portal/images/ficheros/etapasEducativas/secundaria/10/secciones/379/contenidos/7306/keyser1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered a rare female skull of ''P. robustus''. DNH 8, a male mandible called "Orpheus" was also discovered at the same time and adjacent to DNH 7.&lt;ref name="Keyser2000" /&gt; Colin Menter directed research and excavations at the site from 2010 until 2016.&lt;ref name="HerriesMurszewski2018" /&gt; Excavations at the site were conducted by technical assistants in the early years and by a number of field schools in the latter years. These include the University of Florence, Italy (Prof Jacopo Moggi-Cecchi; 2006-2012), the University of Victoria, Canada (2011, 2012, 2014), and La Trobe University, Australia (Prof Andy Herries; 2013–present). The permit and excavations at the site were taken over by Stephanie Baker of the University of Johannesburg in 2017 in collaboration with Prof Andy Herries of La Trobe University (&amp; the University of Johannesburg) as part of an Australian Research Council Discovery Project (2017–21). This also involves collaborations with Prof David Strait of Washington University in St Louis, who runs a US based field school&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sa.wustl.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ViewProgram&amp;Program_ID=10455|title=Washington University Drimolen Cave Field School Summer Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as researchers from South Africa, Australia, the US and Italy.

==Drimolen Main Quarry==
All the hominin remains have been recovered from the area of the classic area of the site known as the Drimolen Main Quarry (DMQ), and include remains of ''Paranthropus robustus'' and early ''Homo''.&lt;ref name="Moggi-CecchiMenter2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moggi-Cecchi|first1=Jacopo|last2=Menter|first2=Colin|last3=Boccone|first3=Silvia|last4=Keyser|first4=André|title=Early hominin dental remains from the Plio-Pleistocene site of Drimolen, South Africa|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|volume=58|issue=5|year=2010|pages=374–405|issn=00472484|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; DMQ dates to sometime between 2.0 and 1.4 Ma (the same age as the site of [[Swartkrans]]).&lt;ref name="HerriesMurszewski2018" /&gt; DMQ has also yielded some of the world's oldest bone tools and some of South Africa's oldest stone tools.&lt;ref name="StammersCaruana2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stammers|first1=Rhiannon C.|last2=Caruana|first2=Matthew V.|last3=Herries|first3=Andy I.R.|title=The first bone tools from Kromdraai and stone tools from Drimolen, and the place of bone tools in the South African Earlier Stone Age|journal=Quaternary International|year=2018|issn=10406182|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2018.04.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drimolen Makondo==
In 2013 a new fossil deposit was discovered around {{convert|50|m}} away from the Main Quarry that is known as the Drimolen Makondo (DMK).&lt;ref name="HerriesMurszewski2018" /&gt; DMK has not yielded any hominin remains but has been dated to a much older time period around 2.61 Ma,&lt;ref name="HerriesMurszewski2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herries|first1=Andy I.R.|last2=Murszewski|first2=Ashleigh|last3=Pickering|first3=Robyn|last4=Mallett|first4=Tom|last5=Joannes-Boyau|first5=Renaud|last6=Armstrong|first6=Brian|last7=Adams|first7=Justin W.|last8=Baker|first8=Stephanie|last9=Blackwood|first9=Alex F.|last10=Penzo-Kajewski|first10=Paul|last11=Kappen|first11=Peter|last12=Leece|first12=AB|last13=Martin|first13=Jesse|last14=Rovinsky|first14=Douglass|last15=Boschian|first15=Giovanni|title=Geoarchaeological and 3D visualisation approaches for contextualising in-situ fossil bearing palaeokarst in South Africa: A case study from the ∼2.61 Ma Drimolen Makondo|journal=Quaternary International|volume=483|year=2018|pages=90–110|issn=10406182|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2018.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it similar in age to sites such as [[Sterkfontein]] and the [[Makapansgat]] Limeworks.

'''El Malpais National Monument''' is a [[National Monument]] located in western [[New Mexico]], in the [[Southwestern United States]].&lt;ref name="SIGVP"/&gt; The name El Malpais is from the Spanish term ''[[Malpaís (landform)|Malpaís]]'', meaning ''[[badlands]]'', due to the extremely barren and dramatic [[volcanic field]] that covers much of the park's area.

It is on the [[Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway (New Mexico)|Trails of the Ancients Byway]], one of the designated [[New Mexico Scenic Byways]].&lt;ref name="NM TOA"&gt;[http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ Trail of the Ancients.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821002106/http://www.newmexico.org/trail-of-the-ancients/ |date=August 21, 2014 }} New Mexico Tourism Department. Retrieved August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and geology==
[[File:ElMalpaisLava.JPG|thumb|left|250px|View of El Malpais [[Lava field|Lava Fields]] and sandstone [[Cliff|bluff]]]]
The lava flows, cinder cones, and other volcanic features of El Malpais are part of the [[Zuni-Bandera volcanic field]], the second largest volcanic field in the [[Basin and Range Province]].&lt;ref name="SIGVP"&gt;{{cite gvp|vn=327120|name=Zuni-Bandera|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This volcanically active area on the southeast margin of the [[Colorado Plateau]] is at the intersection of the [[Rio Grande Rift|Rio Grande Rift Basin]], with its deep [[normal fault]]ing, and the ancient [[Jemez Lineament]]. These two features provide the crustal weaknesses that recent magmatic intrusions and Cenozoic volcanism are attributed to.

The rugged [[Pahoehoe]] and [[A'a|A'a']] [[lava]] flows of the Zuni-Bandera eruptions (also called the Grants Lava Flows) filled a large basin, created by normal faulting associated with the Rio Grande Rift, between the high mesas of the [[Acoma Pueblo]] to the east, [[Mt. Taylor, New Mexico|Mt. Taylor]] to the north, and the [[Zuni Mountains|Zuni Mountain]] anticline to the northwest. Vents associated with these flows include Bandera Crater, El Calderon, and several other cinder cones; more than a dozen older cinder cones follow a roughly north-south distribution along the Chain of Craters west of the monument.

==Natural history==
Some of the oldest [[Douglas Fir|Douglas Fir (''Pseudotsuga'')]] trees on earth, of the ''Pseudotsuga'' subspecies [[Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir|Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga menziesii subsp. glauca'')]], can be found living in El Malpais Monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Nature &amp; Science | work = El Malpais National Monument | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = 2013-01-03 | url = http://www.nps.gov/elma/naturescience/index.htm | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Colorado Plateau volcanism.jpg|thumb|right|287px|A map of late Cenozoic volcanism around the Colorado Plateau, with the location of El Malpais National Monument highlighted.]]
The area around El Malpais was used for resources, settlement, and travel by [[Oasisamerica|Oasisamerica cultures]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], and Spanish colonial and pioneer exploration. Archaeological sites remain in the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History &amp; Culture | work = El Malpais National Monument | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = 2012-12-23 | url = http://www.nps.gov/elma/historyculture/index.htm | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1940s the Malpais lava field was one of the eight candidate sites considered by the [[Manhattan Project]] to test detonate the first [[atomic bomb]], the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]], which did occur to the south at [[White Sands Proving Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/trinity/trinity1.html |title=Trinity Atomic Web Site |publisher=Walker, Gregory |accessdate=2010-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420093358/http://www.cddc.vt.edu/host/atomic/trinity/trinity1.html |archivedate=2010-04-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Defense did use the site as a bombing range to train pilots during World War II.

After the war, the Bureau of Land Management became the administrator of the area. In 1987, President Reagan created El Malpais National Monument and designated it a unit of the National Park Service. It is jointly managed with the nearby [[El Morro National Monument]].

==Features==
El Malpais has many [[lava tube]] caves open to explore (unguided) with a free caving permit, available at NPS-staffed facilities. There are currently four caves accessible by permit: Junction and Xenolith caves in the El Caldron area, and Big Skylight and Giant Ice caves in the Big Tubes area. From December 2010 to June 2013, all caves were temporarily closed to recreational use to protect bats from the spread of [[White Nose Syndrome]] (WNS) until a permitting process, including visitor screening for WNS, could be implemented.&lt;ref name="NPS"/&gt;

A nearby scenic overlook at Sandstone Bluffs offers spectacular panoramic views over the monument's lava flows.

==Protection and management==
[[File:Malpais Natural Arch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|El Malpais National Conservation Area: La Ventana Natural Arch]]
The U.S. [[National Park Service]] protects, manages, and interprets El Malpais National Monument. They operate two Visitor Centers with natural history displays, literature, maps, and staff with helpful information.&lt;ref name="NPS"&gt;{{cite web |title=El Malpais National Monument |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |date=2008-10-21 |url=http://www.nps.gov/elma/index.htm |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Visitor Centers | work = El Malpais National Monument | publisher = [[National Park Service]] | date = 2012-12-26 | url = http://www.nps.gov/elma/planyourvisit/visitorcenters.htm | accessdate = 2013-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Malpais Visitor Center (formerly The Northwest New Mexico Visitor Center) is just south of Exit 85 off I-40 in Grants, New Mexico. The El Malpais Information Center is 28 miles down Highway 53 south of I-40 Exit 81.

The adjacent [[El Malpais National Conservation Area]] is protected and managed by the U.S. [[Bureau of Land Management]].&lt;ref name="BLM"&gt;{{cite web |title=El Malpais National Conservation Area |publisher=[[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=2007-07-11 |url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/rio_puerco/el_malpais.html |accessdate=2008-12-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014200005/http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/rio_puerco/el_malpais.html |archivedate=2008-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They staff the El Malpais National Conservation Area Ranger Station 8 miles down State Highway 117 south of I-40 Exit 89.

The [[Cibola National Forest]] conserves large natural areas, wildlife, and [[habitat]]s in the surrounding region as well.

&lt;!-- white-spacer--&gt;

==In literature==
The second portion of the book ''[[Brave New World]]'' by [[Aldous Huxley]] takes place on the "savage reservation", which is located on land encompassing the parks area.

The ''malpais'' is the setting for a western story, "Flint" (November, 1960) by [[Louis L'Amour]].  Flint is a successful business man who thinks he is dying of cancer and returns to a hidden campsite within the ''malpais'' he had learned of in his youth.

A scene in [[Cormac McCarthy]]'s novel ''[[Blood Meridian]]'' takes place on the malpais.

The '''''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica''''' (''EAe'') is a basic [[Encyclopaedia ]] for [[Ethiopian studies|Ethiopian]] and [[Eritrea]]n Studies. The ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica'' provides access to reliable and state-of-the art information in all fields of the discipline, i.e. anthropology, archaeology, ethnology, history, geography, languages and literatures, art, religion, culture and basic data. Although the main audience is academic, most articles are readable also for non-specialists. The ''EAe'' is illustrated with maps and photographs many of which were never published before. It does, however, employ an in-house form of [[romanization]] of [[Geez language|Geez]], [[Amharic languages|Amharic]], and other languages, which varies greatly from standard formats, such as [[BGN/PCGN romanization|BGN/PCGN]]: the emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelek II]]'s name, for example, is written as "Mənilək II".

Note the papal [[coat of arms]] near the bottom of the fascia. The [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] sitting behind him is wearing a scarlet fascia.]]

The '''fascia''' is a [[sash]] worn by [[cleric]]s and [[seminarian]]s with the [[cassock]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and in the [[Anglican Church]]. It is not worn as a belt but is placed above the waist between the navel and the breastbone (sternum). The ends that hang down are worn on the left side of the body and placed a little forward but not completely off the left hip.

== Use ==

The fascia is not a [[vestment]], but is part of [[choir dress]] and is also used in more solemn everyday dress.

== Colours ==

The [[pope]]'s fascia is [[white]]. Only the [[pope]] may have his [[coat of arms]] placed on the ends of the fascia that hang down near or past the knees.  The fascia worn by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] is [[Scarlet (color)|scarlet]]-red watered silk. The fascia worn by [[nuncio]]s within the territories assigned to them is [[purple]] watered silk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Instruction ''Ut sive sollicite'', 32]&lt;/ref&gt; The fascia worn by [[patriarchs]], [[archbishops]], [[bishops]], [[protonotary apostolic|protonotaries apostolic]], [[honorary prelate]]s, and [[Chaplain of His Holiness|chaplains of His Holiness]] is plain (not watered) [[purple]]. The fascia worn by [[priests]], [[deacons]] and [[seminarians]] is [[black]], while the fascia worn by [[priests]] in the service of the Papal Household is black watered silk.

== Forms ==

Prior to the changes that followed the [[Second Vatican Council]] there were two types of fascia: the ''tufted'' fascia, on which each end was finished in a single large tassel, and the ''fringed'' fascia, on which each end is straight and finished with fringe. The Instruction ''Ut sive sollicite'' of the [[Secretariat of State]], dated 31 March 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/instruction69.htm Text of the Instruction in English, published by ''L'Osservatore Romano'']&lt;/ref&gt; declared that "the sash with tassels is abolished" for cardinals,&lt;ref&gt;Instruction, 3&lt;/ref&gt; bishops,&lt;ref&gt;Instruction, 15&lt;/ref&gt; and "Prelate Superiors of the [[Dicastery|Dicasteries]] of the [[Roman Curia]] who do not have the episcopal dignity, the [[Auditor (ecclesiastical)|Auditors]] of the [[Sacred Roman Rota]], the Promotor General of Justice and the [[Defender of the Bond]] in the [[Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura]], the [[Protonotary Apostolic|Protonotaries Apostolic]] ''de numero'', the Clerics of the [[Apostolic Camera]] and the Prelates of the Pontifical Antechamber".&lt;ref&gt;Instruction, 18&lt;/ref&gt;  This Instruction did not deal with [[Canon (priest)|canons]],&lt;ref&gt;Instruction, 35&lt;/ref&gt; some few of whom have retained the tufted sash to which membership of their particular [[chapter (religion)|chapter]] entitled them.

A 'fashion capital'is a city which has a major influence on international fashion trends and in which the design, production and retailing of fashion products – plus events such as [[fashion week]]s, awards and trade fairs – generate significant economic output. 

The cities considered the global "Big Four" fashion capitals of the 21st century are [[Milan]], [[London]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20141030145348/https://www.fashiondays.com/the-daily-issue/the-big-four-fashion-capitals-of-the-world/ The big four fashion capitals of the world]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|2}}

==Definition of a fashion capital==
A fashion capital assumes leadership role in clothing and design. In addition, fashion capitals usually have a broad mix of business, artistic, entertainment, cultural and leisure activities and are internationally recognised for having a unique and strong identity.&lt;ref&gt;Gemperli, Natalia. "Fashion World Mapper: Your City on the Trend Radar". Master Thesis, University of the Arts Zürich. June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been noted that the status of a fashion capital has become increasingly linked to a city's domestic and international profile.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Cities; Florida Johnson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Florida|first=Richard|title=The World's Leading Cities for Fashion|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/09/worlds-leading-cities-fashion/3182/|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=The Atlantic Cities|date=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion capitals are also likely be part of a wider design scene, with design schools, fashion magazines and a local market of affluent consumers.&lt;ref name="Atlantic Cities; Florida Johnson"/&gt;

Since the 16th century, Milan has been regarded as the Fashion Capital of the World. Nowadays, often the term fashion capital is used to describe the cities that hold fashion weeks, most prominently [[Milan Fashion Week|Milan]], [[Paris Fashion Week|Paris]], [[London Fashion Week|London]] and [[New York Fashion Week|New York]],&lt;ref name="DT Armstrong"&gt;{{cite news|last=Armstrong|first=Lisa|title=Is there a future for Fashion Week?|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG10324975/Is-there-a-future-for-Fashion-Week.html|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=22 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502190831/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG10324975/Is-there-a-future-for-Fashion-Week.html|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Julie|title=Fashion Journalism|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H2xeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Susan|last=Dillon|title=The Fundamentals of Fashion Management|publisher= A&amp;C Black|year=2011|page=115|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3XFMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unveiling Fashion: Business, Culture, and Identity in the Most Glamorous Industry|first=Frédéric|last=Godart|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2012|page=57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H0U0wsIIhMEC&amp;pg=PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Big Four : Fashion Capitals of the World|publisher=Fashion Days|date=5 February 2014|url=http://www.fashiondays.com/the-daily-issue/the-big-four-fashion-capitals-of-the-world/}}&lt;/ref&gt; to showcase their industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Big Four: Fashion capitals of the World|publisher=Fashion Days|date=5 February 2014|url=http://www.fashiondays.com/the-daily-issue/the-big-four-fashion-capitals-of-the-world/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Figures Behind the Catwalk|first=Stephen|last=Heyman|date=1 October 2014|newspaper=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/02/arts/international/the-figures-behind-the-catwalk.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also various other cities host notable [[List of fashion events|fashion events]] and are influential in global fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top fashion weeks around the world|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/2011-top-fashion-weeks-around-the-world-paris-new-york-milan-tokyo-2174288.html|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=31 October 2014|date=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Historically, several cities have been, in turn, fashion capitals. During the [[Renaissance era]], different city-states in what would become modern-day Italy were Europe's main trendsetters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renaissance-spell.com/Renaissance-Fashion.html |title=Renaissance Fashion |publisher=Renaissance-spell.com |date=9 May 2007 |accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the cultural power they exerted in that period of time; this includes cities such as [[Florence]], [[Milan]], [[Rome]], [[Naples]], [[Genoa]], and [[Venice]].

Progressing into the late-16th century, with influence of the English [[Court (royal)|Royal Court]], London became a major city in European fashion. Similarly, due to the power of Spain at the period, the Spanish court started to influence fashion, making it a major centre. In the 17th century, as the Renaissance started to fade away, with the power of the French court under [[Louis XIV]], Paris established itself as Europe's main fashion centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Godart | first = Frédéric | title = The power structure of the fashion industry: Fashion capitals, globalization and creativity | url = http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=17684/ | journal = International Journal of Fashion Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 39–57 | date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century, with the powerful [[British Empire]] and a young [[Queen Victoria]] on the throne (from 1837), London once again became a major fashion leader.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnstone|first=Lucy|title=Corsets &amp; Crinoline in Victorian Fashion|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/corsets-and-crinolines-in-victorian-fashion/|publisher=V&amp;A|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it continued to look to Paris for stylistic inspiration, and the British 'father of haute couture' [[Charles Frederick Worth]] relocated to Paris in 1846 to perfect and then commercialise his craft, also holding the first fashion shows and launching the concept of fashion labels there.&lt;ref name="Vogue WORTH"&gt;{{cite news|last=staff|title=Worth|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Worth|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Vogue|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502165833/http://www.vogue.com/voguepedia/Worth|archivedate=2 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century and beyond===
[[File:Garment District NYWTS crop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|New York's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]], 1955]]
During the [[Golden Twenties]], [[1920s Berlin|Berlin]] was considered the vanguard fashion capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schreiber|first1=Mathias|title=The Age of Excess: Berlin in the Golden Twenties|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/spiegel-series-on-berlin-history-the-golden-twenties-a-866383.html|publisher=SPIEGEL|accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 20th century – but particularly after [[World War II]] – New York City rose in stature as a fashion capital, challenging the dominance of Paris with a different approach, especially in its development and popularisation of [[Sportswear (fashion)|sportswear]] as fashion during the 1940s and '50s.&lt;ref name=RCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Fashioning the City: Exploring Fashion Cultures, Structures and Systems|url=http://fashioningthecity.wordpress.com/call-for-papers/|publisher=Royal College of Art|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s Italy rose in prominence again.&lt;ref name="SCMP Fearon"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fearon|first=Francesca|title=Exhibition at London's V&amp;A Museum to chronicle rise of Italian Fashion|url=http://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-watches/article/1459392/exhibition-londons-va-museum-chronicle-rise-italian|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=South China Morning Post|date=31 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florence re-emerged as a leading city in fashion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gbgiorgini.it/italianfashion.htm |title=the birth of italian fashion|publisher=Gbgiorgini.it|date=|accessdate=2013-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; although focus shifted to Milan from the 1970s on as leading design houses moved to the city.&lt;ref name="Bruzzi Gibson"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruzzi|first=Stella|authorlink=Stella Bruzzi|title=Fashion Cultures Revisited 2013|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, Oxon|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a0xJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=rise+of+Milan+fashion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HUM9Mfiwzp&amp;sig=oBoh-nij6TjDK_wo3eblgQjhhPc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rHFjU7zvHMXvPIvCgYAI&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rise%20of%20Milan%20fashion&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Londons Carnaby Street, 1966.jpg|thumb|250px|"Swinging London," [[Carnaby Street]], c1966]]

In the 1980s, Tokyo claimed its place as a fashion capital with a new generation of avant-garde designers, including [[Issey Miyake]] or [[Rei Kawakubo]] of [[Comme des Garçons]] gaining worldwide attention, even if the fashion show were all in Paris. The fashion was radically different in both its use of textiles and in the way designers cut and draped.&lt;ref name=FIT&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Fashion Now|url=http://fitnyc.edu/8726.asp|work=2010–11|publisher=Fashion Institute of Technology|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MET&gt;{{cite web|title=Miyake, Kawakubo, and Yamamoto: Japanese Fashion in the Twentieth Century|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jafa/hd_jafa.htm|publisher=Metrolopolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, new fashion hubs have emerged worldwide, and the old order has faced challenges from all corners of the globe, including Africa, Australasia and South America.&lt;ref name=Indie&gt;{{cite news|last=staff|title=2011 top fashion weeks around the world: Paris, New York, Milan, Tokyo...|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/2011-top-fashion-weeks-around-the-world-paris-new-york-milan-tokyo-2174288.html|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=The Independent|date=2 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, Berlin has again been highlighted as an increasingly important centre for global fashion trends.&lt;ref name="Fashion United"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|title=Germany's fashion capital: the improbable rise of Berlin|url=http://www.fashionunited.co.uk/fashion-news/fashion/germanys-fashion-capital-the-improbable-rise-of-berlin-2012011713844|work=17 January 2012|publisher=Fashion United|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DW Scholz"&gt;{{cite news|last=Scholz|first=Kay-Alexander|title=The Phoenix of Fashion Rises in Berlin|url=http://www.dw.de/the-phoenix-of-fashion-rises-in-berlin/a-15673135|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Die Welt|date=18 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 issue of ''Fashion Theory: Journal of Dress, Body and Culture'' explored the move away from the traditional dominance of five key cities (London, Milan, New York, Paris, Tokyo), with co-editor Lise Skov suggesting what she described as a "poly-centric" fashion industry developing in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="RCA"/&gt;

===Commentary from Global Language Monitor about the 2017 edition of its annual fashion capital rankings===

The current 2017 rankings now include 63 fashion capitals. There are three new fashion capitals from West Africa: Accra, Ghana; Dakar, Senegal; and Lagos, Nigeria. There is one new fashion capital from East Asia: Kuala Lumpur. There is one new fashion capital from the Middle East: Beirut, Lebanon. Before the various insurgencies in the region, Beirut was known as the Paris of the Middle East. There are two new fashion capitals from North America: Portland, Oregon known for its ‘weird’ culture, much like Austin, Texas and Columbus, Ohio known in the fashion world as the manufacturing headquarters of Henri Bendel, Victoria’s Secret, the Bath &amp; Body Works, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch (A&amp;F), and others.

====Commentary from Global Language Monitor individual cities in the 2017 edition====

No. 3 Barcelona — Moving into Big Four Territory is Big News by definition.

No. 4 Milano — Reclaiming its Big Four status; hmm, perhaps all that re-thinking and revamping just might be having an impact (we’ll see in 2018).

No. 6 London — Had a great run earlier in the decade, but not so great lately (If you consider the No. 6 spot not so great).

No. 7 Amsterdam — Moving up 15 spots is quite a move.

No. 9 Vegas — Back in the Top Ten, more evidence that the Red Carpet experience does indeed have an impact.

No. 10 Dubai — More evidence that billions of dollars Do, indeed, have an impact.

No. 17 Seoul — Finally making the move in Asia, not No. 1, but a respectable No. 3 regionally.

No. 21 Washington, DC — A move into respectability!?

No. 28 Melbourne and No. 34 Sydney — Trading Places

No. 44 Portland, OR — A very nice debut.

No. 47 Kuala Lumpur — Another solid debut.

No. 46 Boston, No. 48 Miami, No.53 Chicago, No. 54 Houston, and No. 59 Toronto — All down by twenty spots, or more.

No. 63 Caracas — On Hiatus due to Insurrection.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">The '''First Things First''' manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by [[Ken Garland]]. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of [[Tony Benn]], radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by [[critical theory]], the [[Frankfurt School]] and the counter-culture of the time it explicitly reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free process.

It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a [[Humanism|Humanist]] dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]].

'''Flash fiction''' is a fictional work of extreme brevity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://shortstories.about.com/od/Flash/a/What-Is-Flash-Fiction.htm|title=What Is Flash Fiction?|author=Catherine Sustana|date=|work=About Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; that still offers character and plot development.

Some commentators have suggested that flash fiction possesses a unique literary quality, in its ability to hint at or imply a larger story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smokelong.com/why-flash-fiction-because-of-a-parrot-and-a-porn-star-of-course/#_edn3|title=Why Flash Fiction?

Norton, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Flash fiction has roots going back to prehistory, recorded at origin of writing, including [[fable]]s and [[parable]]s, notably ''[[Aesop's Fables]]'' in the west, and [[Panchatantra]] and [[Jataka tales]] in India. Later examples include the tales of [[Nasreddin]], and [[Zen]] [[koan]]s such as ''[[The Gateless Gate]]''.

In the United States, early forms of flash fiction can be found in the 19th century, notably in the figures of [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ambrose Bierce]], and [[Kate Chopin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Specimen Fiction: The 19th Century Tradition of the American Short-Short Story Critical Essay with Creative Work |last=Roth |first=Forrest Stephen
|type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Louisiana at Lafayette |year=2013 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/90/3590051.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s flash fiction was referred to as the "short short story" and was associated with ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine; and in the 1930s, collected in anthologies such as ''The American Short Short Story''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ofw2AQAAIAAJ |title=The American Short Short Story - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William Somerset Maugham]] was a notable proponent, with his ''Cosmopolitans: Very Short Stories'' (1936) being an early collection. 

In Japan, flash fiction was popularized in the post-war period particularly by {{Nihongo|Michio Tsuzuki|[[:ja:都筑道夫|都筑道夫]]}}.

==Authors==
Practitioners have included [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]] of Shiraz ("[[Gulistan of Sa'di]]"), [[Bolesław Prus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Two Micro-Stories by [[Bolesław Prus]]," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', 1995, no. 1, pp. 99-103.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Zygmunt Szweykowski]], ''Twórczość Bolesława Prusa'', p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anton Chekhov]], [[O.

Clarke]], [[Richard Brautigan]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Kurt Vonnegut, Jr.]], [[Fredric Brown]], [[John Cage]], [[Philip K. Dick]] and [[Robert Sheckley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2011/1026/1224306493734.html |title=Flash fiction: 'Intense, urgent and a little explosive' |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2011-10-26 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hemingway also wrote 18 pieces of flash fiction that were included in his first short-story collection, ''[[In Our Time (short story collection)|In Our Time]]''. It is disputed whether (to win a bet), as alleged, he also wrote the flash fiction "[[For sale: baby shoes, never worn|For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never Worn]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/babyshoes.asp |title=Ernest Hemingway - Baby Shoes |publisher=snopes.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also notable are the 62 "short-shorts" which comprise ''Severance,'' the thematic collection by [[Robert Olen Butler]] in which each story describes the remaining 90 seconds of conscious awareness within human heads which have been decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/books/review/Barbash.t.html?_r=0|title=Dead Heads|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English speaking writers well known for their published flash fiction include [[Lydia Davis]], [[David Gaffney]] and [[Robert Scotellaro]] and online include [[Sherrie Flick]], [[Bruce Holland Rogers]], [[Steve Almond]], [[Barbara Henning]], [[Grant Faulkner]], and [[Nancy Stohlman]].

Spanish-speaking literature has many authors of microstories, including [[Augusto Monterroso]] ("El dinosaurio") and [[Luis Felipe Lomelí]] ("[[El emigrante (short story)|El Emigrante]]"). Their microstories are some of the shortest ever written in that language. In Spain, authors of ''microrrelatos'' (very short fictions) have included [[Andrés Neuman]], [[Ramón Gómez de la Serna]], [[José Jiménez Lozano]], [[Javier Tomeo]], [[José María Merino]], [[Juan José Millás]], and [[Óscar Esquivias]].&lt;ref name="Vall2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Valls|first=Fernando|title=Mar de pirañas|url=http://www.diariodeleon.es/noticias/filandon/las-voces-del-microrrelato_735678.html|accessdate=19 November 2012|year=2012|publisher=Menoscuarto|isbn=8496675890|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his collection ''La mitad del diablo'' (Páginas de Espuma, 2006), [[:es:Juan Pedro Aparicio|Juan Pedro Aparicio]] included the one-word story [[:es:Luis XIV|Luis XIV]], which in its entirety reads: "Yo" ("I"). In Argentina, notable contemporary contributors to the genre have included [[Marco Denevi]], [[Luisa Valenzuela]], and [[Ana María Shua]].

The Italian writer [[Italo Calvino]] consciously searched for a short narrative form, drawing inspiration from Argentine writers [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Adolfo Bioy Casares]] and finding that Monterroso's was "the most perfect he could find"; "El dinosaurio", in turn, possibly inspired his "The Dinosaurs".&lt;ref name="Weiss1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Beno|title=Italo Calvino|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zRewK6x7HQUC&amp;pg=PA103|accessdate=9 November 2012|year=1993|publisher=U of South Carolina P|isbn=9780872498587|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France and [[Francophone]] countries, ''micronouvelles'' have been popularized by authors such as [[Jacques Fuentealba]] and [[Vincent Bastin]].&lt;ref&gt;Irène Langlet, "Les Echelles de bâti de la science-fiction," in ''Revue française de Fixxion contemporaine - Critical Review of Contemporary Franch Fixxion'', n° 1, ''Micro/Macro,'' 2011 and Cristina Alvarez, "Nouveaux genres littéraires urbains - les nouvelles en trois lignes contemporaines au sein des micronouvelles," in ''Atas do Simpósio Internacional : Microcontos e outras microformas,'' Minho (Portugal), {{ISBN|978-972-8063-65-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German-language authors of ''Kürzestgeschichten,'' influenced by brief narratives penned by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Franz Kafka]], have included [[Peter Bichsel]], [[Heimito von Doderer]], [[Günter Kunert]], and [[Helmut Heißenbüttel]].

The [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speaking world has produced a number of micro-story authors, including the [[Nobel Prize]]-winning Egyptian author [[Naguib Mahfouz]], whose book ''Echoes of an Autobiography'' is composed mainly of such stories. Other flash fiction writers in Arabic include [[Zakaria Tamer]], [[Haidar Haidar]], and [[Laila al-Othman]].

In the Russian-speaking world the best known flash fiction author is [[Linor Goralik]].

In the southwestern [[States and union territories of India|Indian state]] of [[Kerala]] [[:ml:പി.കെ._പാറക്കടവ്|PK Parakkadavu]] is known for his many micro-stories in the [[Malayalam|Malayalam language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Through the Mini-Looking Glass|last=Parakkadavu|first=PK|publisher=Lead Books|year=2013|isbn=|location=Kozhikode|pages=|translator-last=VK Sreelesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
A number of print journals dedicate themselves to flash fiction. These include ''Flash: The International Short-Short Story Magazine''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://hassacc.com/archive/?vid=1&amp;aid=3&amp;kid=150201-19&amp;q=f1.|title=Flash Fiction: Literary fast food or a metamodern (sub)genre with potential?|author=Bente Lucht|date=November 17, 2014|work=Human And Social Sciences at the Common Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Vestal Review''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/publishing-tips/flash-fiction-list-resources|title=Flash Fiction: A List of Resources|author=Becky Tuch|date=|work=The Review Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internet==
Access to the Internet has enhanced an awareness of flash fiction, with online journals being devoted entirely to the style. ''SmokeLong Quarterly'', founded by Dave Clapper in 2003, is "dedicated to bringing the best flash fiction to the web ... whether written by widely published authors or those new to the craft."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Smoke Break: Guest Editors Choose Flash Fiction for Online Mag|last = Hart|first = Melissa|date = March 2016|journal = The Writer (Retrieved 2016-02-11)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other online flash fiction journals include ''wigleaf'', ''Flash Fiction Online'' and ''Flash Fiction Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pratt |first=Mary K. |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/164355/how_technology_is_changing_what_we_read.html |title=How Technology Is Changing What We Read |publisher=PCWorld |date=2009-05-05 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A comprehensive list of online magazines accepting flash fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://dlshirey.com/the-short-list/|title=The Short List|author=DL Shirey|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Paulo Coelho]] remarked that the "democratization of communication offered by the Internet has made positive in-roads" and directly influenced the style's popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/08/15/short.stories/index.html |title=Six of the best: CNN readers tell us their stories | date=2008-08-18 |publisher=Cnn.com| accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form is popular, with most online literary journals now publishing flash fiction.

Social media has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Third Word Press]] using flash-fiction to create stories on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://daily.bhaskar.com/news/LIF-satirical-lines-showing-indian-hypocrisy-5088229-PHO.html|title=6 nanotales by anonymous writers show reality of Indian hypocrisy!|date=2015-08-19|work=DailyBhaskar|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.freepressjournal.in/featured-blog/micro-fiction-the-new-age-writing-fad/1075708|title=Micro fiction: The new-age writing fad {{!}} Free Press Journal|website=www.freepressjournal.in|access-date=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017, ''[[The New Yorker]]'' ran a series of flash fiction [http://www.newyorker.com/books/flash-fiction stories] online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">{{About|the taboo in Irish mythology|the band|Geasa (band)|the surname|Geis (surname)}}

In [[Irish language|Irish]], a '''''geas''''' (alternatives: '''''geis''''', '''''géis''''', '''''deas'''''; plural ''geasa'') is an idiosyncratic [[taboo]], whether of obligation or prohibition, similar to being under a [[vow]]. The plural is also used to mean specifically a [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]] prohibiting some action, common in Irish folklore and mythology. It is this additional meaning of the plural which the article discusses.

The equivalent [[Scottish Gaelic]] word, also used in English, is "'''''geas'''''" ({{IPA-gd|ˈkes||}}, plural "geasan").&lt;ref&gt;Michael Quinion, [http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-gei1.htm World Wide Words] (accessed 8 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Irish mythology==
A ''geas'' can be compared with a [[curse]] or, paradoxically, a gift. If someone under a ''geas'' violates the associated taboo, the infractor will suffer dishonor or even death.  On the other hand, the observing of one's ''geas'' is believed to bring power. Often it is women who place ''geasa'' upon men.  In some cases the woman turns out to be a [[goddess]] or other [[sovereignty]] figure.&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"&gt;MacKillop, James (1998) ''A Dictionary of Celtic Mythology''. Oxford, Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280120-1}} p.249&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''geas'' is often a key device in hero tales, such as that of [[Cúchulainn]] in [[Irish mythology]]. Traditionally, the doom of heroes comes about due to their violation of their ''geas'', either by accident, or by having multiple ''geasa'' and then being placed in a position where they have no option but to violate one ''geas'' in order to maintain another. For instance, Cúchulainn has a ''geas'' to never eat dog meat, and he is also bound by a ''geas'' to eat any food offered to him by a woman.  When a [[hag]] offers him dog meat, he has no way to emerge from the situation unscathed; this leads to his death.&lt;ref name="MacKillop1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MacKillop2"&gt;MacKillop (1998) pp.115-117&lt;/ref&gt;

A beneficial ''geas'' might involve a [[prophecy]] that a person would die in a particular way;  the particulars of their death in the vision might be so bizarre that the person could then avoid their fate for many years.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

==Welsh mythology==
There is a considerable similarity between the [[Goidelic]] geasa and the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] [[tynged]]. This is not surprising given the close origins of many of the variants of [[Celtic mythology]].

For example, the Welsh hero [[Lleu Llaw Gyffes]] (in one version of his story) was destined to die neither "during the day or night, nor indoors or outdoors, neither riding nor walking, not clothed and not naked, nor by any weapon lawfully made." He was safe until his wife, [[Blodeuwedd]], learning of these foretold conditions, convinced him to show her how he could theoretically be stepping out of a river onto a riverbank sheltered by a roof and put one foot on a goat, and so on, thus enabling the conditions that allowed him to be killed.

==Parallels in English literature==
Prohibitions and taboos similar to ''geasa'' are also found in more recent [[English literature]], though they are not described as ''geasa'' in those texts.  For example, in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Macbeth]]'', the title character believes he is safe because "no man of woman born shall harm Macbeth". However, his nemesis Macduff was "from his mother's womb untimely ripp'd" (i.e., born by [[Caesarean section]]), and was therefore not "of woman born".

[[Terry Pratchett]]'s novel ''[[Sourcery]]'' (1988) presents another example: the [[barbarian]] Nijel the Destroyer is under a geas that prevents him from dying until he does something brave, and thus he chooses to be an immortal coward.

Another example is the Witch-King of Angmar from [[Tolkien's legendarium|Tolkien's Legendarium]], who has a geas-like prophecy described by the Elven hero, Glorfindel: "Far off yet is his doom, and not by the hand of man shall he fall." In this the meaning is quite literal, for the Witch-king is eventually struck down by Eowyn, a shieldmaiden of Rohan, and thus not a man but a woman.

The '''gentleman detective''' is a type of [[fictional character]]. He (or, less commonly, she) has long been a staple of crime fiction, particularly in [[detective fiction|detective novels and short stories]] set in Britain in the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction|Golden Age]]. The heroes of these adventures are typically both [[gentleman#Gentleman by conduct|gentlemen by conduct]] and also members of the British [[gentry]]. The literary heroes being in opposition to professional police force  detectives from the working classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=quiteirregular |url=http://quiteirregular.wordpress.com/2013/05/06/gentlemen-and-players-the-police-and-the-amateurs-in-detective-fiction/ |title=Gentlemen and Players: The Police and the Amateurs in Detective Fiction &amp;#124; quiteirregular |publisher=Quiteirregular.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentlemen detectives include [[amateur]]s, [[Private investigator|private detectives]] and professional [[police]]men. They are always well educated, frequently have unusual or eccentric hobbies, and are commonly found in their natural environment, an [[English country house]]. This [[archetype]] of British detective contrasts with the more "[[hardboiled]]" counterpart in American crime fiction.

== Early examples ==
{{main|Detective fiction#Beginnings of detective fiction}}

Gentlemen detectives appeared early in modern detective fiction, which began in the late 19th century.

[[C. Auguste Dupin]], created by  [[Edgar Allan Poe]], is widely considered to be the first [[fictional character|fictional]] [[detective]] in [[English literature]].&lt;ref name="SilermanONPoe"&gt;{{cite book|author=Silverman,Kenneth|title=Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|year=1991 |isbn=0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in three short stories written in the 1840s: "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]" (1841), "[[The Mystery of Marie Rogêt]]" (1842) and "[[The Purloined Letter]]" (1844).

Poe created Dupin before the word ''detective'' had been coined, but began many common elements of detective fiction: Dupin shares some features with the later gentleman detective. He was "…the first fictional detective of importance and the model for virtually every cerebral crime solver who followed."&lt;ref&gt;C. Steinbrunner &amp; O. Penzler (editors-in-chief). ''Encyclopedia of mystery and detection'', 1976. New York: Prentice-Hall: p137&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, [[Dorothy L. Sayers]] noted that "[[Sherlock Holmes]] modelled himself to a large extent upon (Poe's) Dupin, substituting cocaine for candlelight, with accompaniments of [[Tobacco|shag]] and fiddle-playing." &lt;ref&gt;Dorothy L. Sayers (1929). Introduction (edited) to ''The omnibus of crime'' in Robin W. Winks (editor) (1980). ''Detective fiction: a collection of critical essays.'' Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall: p58&lt;/ref&gt;

Dupin is French, not English, but is probably a ''gentleman''. He comes from a once wealthy family but has been reduced "by a variety of untoward events" to more humble circumstances. He is entirely amateur and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life.&lt;ref&gt;Stashower, Daniel. ''The Beautiful Cigar Girl''. New York: PenguinBooks, 2006: 20. {{ISBN|0-525-94981-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lives in [[Paris]] with his close friend, the anonymous [[narrator]] of the stories. Like the much later [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] (see below), Dupin is a [[bibliophile]], and met his narrator friend while both were searching for "the same rare and very remarkable volume" in an obscure [[library]].&lt;ref&gt;Krutch, Joseph Wood. ''Edgar Allan Poe: A Study in Genius''. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1926: 108.&lt;/ref&gt; For hobbies, Dupin is "fond" of enigmas, conundrums, and [[hieroglyph]]ics.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenheim, Shawn James. ''The Cryptographic Imagination: Secret Writing from Edgar Poe to the Internet''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1997: 21. {{ISBN|978-0-8018-5332-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dupin also bears the French title ''[[knight|Chevalier]]'',&lt;ref name="SilermanONPoe" /&gt; meaning that he is a knight in the [[Légion d'honneur]].

The classic British gentleman detective appears soon after Poe's Dupin. A gentleman amateur is the ultimate hero of ''[[The Moonstone]]'' (1868), a famous [[epistolary novel]] widely considered the first true [[detective novel]] in [[English language|English]]. Its author, [[Wilkie Collins]] was a lawyer, and a close friend of [[Charles Dickens]]. Collins also used gifted amateurs in his earlier mystery novel, ''[[The Woman in White (novel)|The Woman in White]]'' (1859).

In ''[[The Moonstone]]'', Rachel Verinder is the only child of a rich, aristocratic widow. On her eighteenth birthday, she is bequeathed an enormous diamond; that night, this 'moonstone' is stolen from the [[English country house|country house]] of her mother, Lady Verinder. After local police are baffled, a [[Bow Street Runners|Bow Street Runner]] called Sergeant Cuff is called in. Sergeant Cuff is honourable and skilful, but he is ''not'' a gentleman, and is unable to break Rachel's reticence about what is clearly an [[:wikt:inside job|inside job]].

The mystery is eventually solved by Franklin Blake, who is a gifted amateur—and definitely a member of the [[gentry]]. The social difference between Collins' two detectives is nicely shown by their relationships with the Verinder family: Sergeant Cuff becomes a great friend of Lady Verinder's steward (chief servant), whereas Franklin Blake eventually marries Rachel, her daughter.

=== Sherlock Holmes ===
The most famous of all fictional detectives, Sherlock Holmes, may also be considered a gentleman, at least by background. Holmes was the creation of [[Scotland|Scottish]] author and [[physician]] [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. He appeared in four [[novel]]s and fifty-six [[short story|short stories]], all but four stories narrated by his associate, the notable [[John Watson (Sherlock Holmes)|Dr Watson]]. These works cover in fiction a period from around 1878 up to 1907, with a final case in 1914. Both characters also appear in many [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|pastiches]].

Holmes is a brilliant [[London]]-based and self-styled ''consulting detective''. In their debut (the 1887 novel, ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]''), he tells Watson that this occupation is unique (which at that date it was). As a retired army doctor, Dr Watson is far closer to the stereotypic English gentleman than Holmes, yet has no social reservations about beginning his long association with the detective. In the best traditions of the [[gentry]], Holmes proves to be physically brave, and competent with fists, sword and pistol. Like the earlier [[C. Auguste Dupin|Dupin]] and the later [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] (see below), Holmes is also a competent [[cryptanalyst]] (for instance, [[The Adventure of the Dancing Men|The Dancing Men]], 1903).

Conan Doyle never gave much background about Holmes' family, but his hero was apparently born in 1854 (estimated from [[His Last Bow]], 1917). He also has an eccentric older brother, [[Mycroft Holmes]], a senior public servant and member of the [[Diogenes Club]]. As further indirect evidence that Holmes is an educated gentleman, Conan Doyle indicates that Holmes is fluent in Latin (''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'', 1887), and as the series continues his speech is replete with references to the [[Bible]], [[Shakespeare]], and even [[Goethe]]. Holmes had earlier attended university, where he began his detecting as an amateur ([[The Adventure of the Gloria Scott|The Gloria Scott]], 1893, and [[The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual|The Musgrave Ritual]], 1893).  A violinist himself, Holmes loves music ([[The Red-Headed League]], 1890), sometimes to the point of eccentricity; in [[The Adventure of the Bruce-Partington Plans|The Bruce-Partington Plans]] (1912), Watson reports that "Holmes lost himself in a monograph which he had undertaken upon the Polyphonic [[Motet]]s of [[Lassus]]."

== Golden Age examples ==

The renowned crime writers of the [[Golden Age of Detective Fiction]] were mostly British and mostly women, including the four "Queens of Crime" ([[Margery Allingham]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Ngaio Marsh]] and [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]). They all produced at least one gentleman detective. Their books featuring these characters are still generally in print.

*'''[[Hercule Poirot]]''' first appeared in 1920, in [[Agatha Christie]]'s first book, ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]''. He was immensely popular during the "Golden Age", becoming the most famous detective since Sherlock Holmes. He appeared in 33 novels, one play, and more than 50 short stories published between 1920 and 1975 and set in the same era. Poirot was formerly Chief of Police of Brussels, until "the Great War" (WWI) forced him to leave for England. It was there that he met his longtime friend [[Arthur Hastings]], who accompanied him on many cases. Throughout his career, he solved many cases across Europe, occasionally undertaking cases for the British government and Secret Service, including foiling the attempted abduction of the British Prime Minister. Poirot operates as a fairly conventional detective, depending on logic, which is represented by two common phrases he uses: his use of "[[Grey matter|the little grey cells]]" and "order and method". Poirot is occasionally assisted by his secretary, [[Miss Lemon|Miss Felicity Lemon]], and friend [[Chief Inspector Japp]], of [[Scotland Yard]]. Poirot's appearance is of a short, dignified man. His head is exactly the shape of an egg, with a stiff and military-like moustache. His attire consists of a [[three-piece suit]], accompanied by a [[pocketwatch]], [[spats (footwear)|spats]], patent leather shoes and a pair of [[pince-nez]]. He also wears a "Tussie-mussie" lapel pin he received as a gift in ''[[The Mysterious Affair at Styles]]''.
*'''[[Lord Peter Wimsey]]''' was the creation of [[Dorothy L. Sayers]]. Wimsey is an [[archetype]] for British gentlemen detectives. Reputedly born in 1890, he  first appeared in ''[[Whose Body?]]'' (1923), the first of 11 chronological novels and several collections of short stories. Wimsey is a purely amateur sleuth, and is unquestionably an English gentleman. He is polished, aristocratic, wealthy, and the younger brother of a duke. Wimsey is extremely clever, though he usually tries to hide it. As shown in ''[[Have His Carcase]]'' (1932), Wimsey is a competent [[cryptanalyst]], like both the earlier Dupin and Sherlock Holmes. Again like Holmes, Wimsey is physically brave (despite being physically small), and is competent with his fists (''[[Clouds of Witness]]'', 1926). Wimsey is notably eccentric in manner; this is most evident in the first five novels. As Sayers' work progress and as Wimsey ages, he rounds out and mellows greatly. At age 45 he marries [[Harriet Vane]], a crime writer. According to Barbara Reynolds, her friend and biographer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dorothy L. Sayers: Her Life and Soul|author=Barbara Reynolds|location=London|year=1993|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|page=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sayers remarked that Lord Peter began as a mixture of [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Bertie Wooster]]. She claimed that she had developed the "husky voiced, dark-eyed" Harriet to put an end to Lord Peter via matrimony. Vane features in two further novels (''[[Have His Carcase]]'', 1932, &amp; ''[[Gaudy Night]]'', 1935) before agreeing to marry Wimsey. In the course of writing these novels, Sayers gave Lord Peter and Harriet so much life that she was never able to, as she put it, "see Lord Peter exit the stage." In an essay by one of her "Golden Age" rivals, Ngaio Marsh (see below), Sayers is accused of having "fallen in love" with Wimsey.&lt;ref name="NMarshessay"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greene, Douglas G. (editor)|title=Alleyn and others: the collected short fiction of Ngaio Marsh|publisher=International Polygonics|year=1995 |isbn=1-55882-028-0 |id=(hardcover 1989, edition), {{ISBN|978-1-55882-050-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Albert Campion]]''' first appeared in 1929, and was created by [[Margery Allingham]] as a parody of Lord Peter Wimsey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strandmag.com/campion.htm "The Great Detectives: Albert Campion" by Mike Ripley, Strand Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Campion is supposedly the [[pseudonym]] used by a man who was born in 1900 into a prominent British [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] family. He was educated at Totham School and the (fictitious) St. Ignatius' College, [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] (according to a mini-biography included in ''[[Sweet Danger]]'', 1933). Ingenious, resourceful and well-educated, in his 20s he assumed the name Campion and began a life as an adventurer and detective. As Allingham's work progressed, Campion established his own identity. He first appeared as a supporting character in ''[[The Crime at Black Dudley]]'' (1929), an [[adventure novel|adventure story]] involving a ring of criminals, and would go on to feature in another 17 [[novel]]s and over 20 [[Short story|short stories]].
*'''[[Roderick Alleyn]]''' first appeared in 1934,&lt;ref name="manlaydead"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marsh, Ngaio |title=A man lay dead|publisher=Collins|location=Great Britain |year=1934 |pages= |isbn=0-00-615591-X }} (Fontana, 1960, edition)&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of [[New Zealand]]er, [[Ngaio Marsh]], who was then living in London.&lt;ref name="NMarshessay" /&gt; Alleyn featured in a chronological series of 32 detective novels, which finished as late as 1982. He was apparently born around 1893, schooled at Eton, graduated from [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] around 1915, served in the army for three years in the [[First World War]], then spent a year (1919-1920) in the British [[diplomatic service|Foreign Service]]. He finally joined the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] as a constable in about 1920 or 1921. When the series opens,&lt;ref name="manlaydead"/&gt; Alleyn is aged about 40 and is already a [[inspector|Chief Detective-Inspector]] in the [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] at [[Scotland Yard]]. As the series progresses, Alleyn marries and has a son, and eventually rises to the rank of [[superintendent (police)|Chief Superintendent]]. Alleyn is a thoroughly professional policeman, but socially is very like Wimsey. Both were reputedly educated at Eton and Oxford (being only three or so years apart, they perhaps should have known each other). Both detectives eventually marry a former murder suspect and have children. As depicted by Marsh, Alleyn's family is similar to that created by Sayers for her Wimsey, in that Alleyn has a titled older brother, who however is much less grand (merely a [[baronet]] rather than a [[duke]]). Like Wimsey, Alleyn's titled brother is less intelligent and more conventional than his more famous younger sibling. Alleyn's mother, Lady Alleyn, closely resembles in manner Wimsey's mother, the Dowager Duchess of Denver. Both ladies are affable, intelligent, and strongly support (and perhaps prefer) their younger sons. One marked difference between the fictional biographies of Alleyn and Wimsey, who are about the same age, is in their supposed military service during the First World War. Alleyn's army service is glossed over and never discussed, whereas Wimsey's distinguished service on the [[Western Front (World War 1)|Western Front]] has mentally scarred him for life. Another difference is that Wimsey deliberately cultivates his aristocratic eccentricities (''inter alia'', he wears a [[monocle]], delights in his [[Received pronunciation|Oxford accent]], and collects [[incunabula]]), whereas Alleyn is not at all eccentric, and plays down his upper-class background.
*'''[[Miss Marple]]''' is one of the two great detective creations of [[Agatha Christie]], the best known of all the "Golden Age" writers. Miss Marple is an amiable elderly spinster who first appeared in 1927. Her detective feats are largely based on her profound knowledge of human nature, gained (she maintains) from closely observing life in her small village. The daughter of a clergyman, she is not from the aristocracy or landed gentry, but is quite at home amongst them. Miss Marple would probably have been happy to describe herself as a ''gentlewoman''. Christie had a rather upper-class background herself:  she grew up in a large house with servants, with a father rich enough not to work, a private education, and many country house parties before World War 1.&lt;ref name="ChristieAutobiography"&gt;{{cite book|author=Christie, Agatha|title=An autobiography|publisher=Collins|year=1977 |isbn=0-00-216012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her [[Agatha Christie: An Autobiography|autobiography]], Christie stated that she partly based Miss Marple upon her grandmother and her friends.
*'''Mr. Satterthwaite''' is one of Christie's lesser known amateur detectives. This charming, elderly gentleman only appears in  ''[[The Mysterious Mr. Quin]]'' (1930) and ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' (1934). He is physically small, highly cultivated, an inveterate snob with a taste for duchesses, and is wealthy besides. By way of contrast, Christie's most famous detective character ([[Hercule Poirot]]) is a foreigner, and is thus outside the English class system. Poirot takes full advantage of this sublety, not least in ''[[Three Act Tragedy]]'' in which he catches a serial killer with Mr. Satterthwaite's assistance.
*'''[[Arsène Lupin]]''', the French "[[gentleman thief]]" who debuted in 1905, may just as well be considered a gentleman detective.

== Modern examples ==
Several modern day fictional characters may be considered examples of gentlemen detectives. Like [[Roderick Alleyn|Alleyn]] but unlike earlier gifted amateurs such as [[Lord Peter Wimsey|Wimsey]], [[Albert Campion|Campion]] or [[Miss Marple]], several modern "gentleman detectives" are professional policemen.

'''[[Adam Dalgliesh]]''', the creation of [[P. D. James]], flourishes in the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], despite being definitely [[gentry]] where such a background may be a disadvantage. Like the earlier [[Miss Marple]], Dalgliesh is the child of an Anglican clergyman. He is somewhat of a recluse and, more eccentrically, a successful poet.

'''[[Inspector Morse]]''', the subject of works by [[Colin Dexter]], works in Oxford and is (or was) upwardly mobile: he won a scholarship to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] but subsequently failed. Like Alleyn and Wimsey, Morse served in the British army before joining the police, but unlike them, he served not as a commissioned officer in a prestigious regiment but as a non-commissioned officer in the [[Royal Military Police]]. Morse's snobbery is intellectual rather than a question of breeding or social advantage.

'''[[The Inspector Lynley Mysteries|Detective Inspector Lynley]]''' is another truly aristocratic member of the Police, being an Earl. Much of the plot of the novels by [[Elizabeth George]] revolve around his working relationship with Detective Sergeant [[Barbara Havers]], who is of lower-class origins. Both show greater loyalty to each other than to official regulations and accepted attitudes to their relative stations, and both are capable of self-sacrificing actions of ''[[noblesse oblige]]''.

'''[[Carmen Sandiego (character)|Carmen Isabella Sandiego]]''', the "World's Greatest Thief", was originally ACME Crimenet's most intelligent and distinguished ''gentleman detective'' with a flawless record in solved cases. She got so bored, she changed careers as a ''[[gentleman thief]]'' and became spymaster and CEO of V.I.L.E., all just for the challenge.

'''[[Professor Hershel Layton|Professor Layton]]''' from the video game series named after him. He is a professor of archaeology who solves various puzzles with his young apprentice Luke Triton.

'''[[Alex Drake (Ashes to Ashes)|Detective Inspector Alexandra "Alex" Drake (née Price)]]''', the well-bred, posh protagonist of ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' (2007-2009, mentioned in ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' in 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Awake in 2008, [[Sam Tyler]] records his notes onto micro-cassettes and asks a subordinate to post a tape to Psychological Services Branch. He explains that an officer there is studying colleagues like him who have undergone traumatic events, and that talking to her has been very cathartic to him. His transcribed notes are read by Alex's daughter Molly over the opening credits of ''Ashes to Ashes'', whereupon Alex and Molly briefly discuss the books that Alex is writing about psychologically traumatised police officers in general, and Sam Tyler in particular.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inspector#United Kingdom|DI]] Drake, the orphaned daughter of a solicitor and barrister, was reared from adolescence by her parents' associate after she witnessed their violent deaths and narrowly avoiding being killed with them. She attended good schools and studied psychology before joining the [[Metropolitan Police]] and fast-tracking up the ranks. A gunshot to her head in 2007 sends her back in time to 1981, three months before her parents' murders, and places her in the company of comparatively Neanderthal detectives who had transplanted themselves from the North a year earlier.

'''[[Dempsey and Makepeace|Detective Sergeant Makepeace, Lady Harriet "Harry" Makepeace]]''', one of the two eponymous characters of ''[[Dempsey and Makepeace]]'' (1985-1988). The well-schooled daughter of Lord Winfield, Lady Harriet is assigned as an armed detective sergeant in the [[Metropolitan Police]]'s [fictional] specialised task force, SI 10, and finds herself partnered with (and subordinate to) working-class [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] [[Lieutenant#Police rank|Lieutenant]] James Dempsey who is on extended loan to the Met.

== Ancient Near East ==
{{see also|Sacred prostitution}}
The [[Ancient Near East]] was home to many shrines, temples or "houses of heaven," which were dedicated to various deities. These shrines and temples were documented by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Aabo%3Atlg%2C0016%2C001&amp;query=book%3D1%3Achapter%3D199%3Asection%3D1 1.199], tr A.D. Godley (1920)&lt;/ref&gt; where [[sacred prostitution]] was a common practice.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example,  [[James Frazer]] (1922), ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', 3e, [[s:The Golden Bough/Adonis in Cyprus|Chapter 31: Adonis in Cyprus]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sumeria]]n records dating back to ca. 2400 [[Common Era|BCE]] are the earliest recorded mention of prostitution as an occupation. These describe a [[temple]]-[[brothel]] operated by Sumerian priests in the city of [[Uruk]]. This ''kakum'' or temple was dedicated to the goddess [[Ishtar]] and was the home to three grades of women. The first grade of women were only permitted to perform sexual rituals in the temple, the second group had access to the grounds and catered to visitors, and the third and lowest class lived on the temple grounds. The third class was also free to find customers in the streets.

During the region of [[Canaan]], a significant portion of temple prostitutes were male. This was also widely practiced in [[Sardinia]] and in some of the [[Phoenicia]]n cultures, usually in honor of the goddess [[`Ashtart|Ashtart]]. Presumably under the influence of the Phoenicians,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} this practice was developed in other ports of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], such as [[Erice]] ([[Sicily]]), [[Locri|Locri Epizephiri]], [[Crotone|Croton]], Rossano Vaglio and Sicca Veneria. Other hypotheses include [[Asia Minor]], [[Lydia]], [[Syria]] and the Etruscans.

In later years sacred prostitution and similar classifications for females were known to have existed in Greece, Rome, India, China, and Japan.{{sfn|Murphy|1983|}} Such practices came to an end when the emperor [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] in the fourth century AD destroyed the [[goddess]] temples and replaced the religious practices with [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Eusebius]], ''Life of Constantine'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lv.html 3.55] and [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf201.iv.vi.iii.lviii.html 3.58]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biblical references ==
Prostitution was commonplace in [[ancient Israel]]. There are a number of references to prostitution in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The Biblical story of [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]] ({{bibleverse||Genesis|38:14-26|HE}}) provides a depiction of prostitution being practiced in that time period. In this story the prostitute waits at the side of a highway where she waits for travelers. She covers her face in order to identify herself as a prostitute. Instead of being paid in money she asks for a kid goat. This would have been the equivalent of a high price, showing that only the wealthy owner of numerous herds could have afforded to pay for a single sexual encounter. Under this system if the traveller does not have his cattle with him he must give valuables to the woman as a deposit until a kid goat is delivered to her. The woman in the story was not a legitimate prostitute but actually was Judah's widowed daughter-in-law, who sought to trick Judah into impregnating her. However, since she succeeded in impersonating a prostitute her conduct can be assumed to accurately represent the behaviour of a prostitute in society during that time period.

In a later Biblical story, found in the [[Book of Joshua]], a prostitute in [[Jericho]] named [[Rahab]] assisted Israelite spies by providing them with information regarding the current socio-cultural and military situation. [[Rahab]] was knowledgeable in these matters because of her popularity with the high-ranking nobles. The Israelite spies, in return for this information, promised to save her and her family during the planned military invasion, only if she kept the details of her contact with them a secret. She would leave a sign on her residence that indicated to the advancing soldiers not to attack the people within. When the people of Israel conquered Canaan, she converted to Judaism and married a prominent member of the people.

In the [[Book of Revelation]], the [[Whore of Babylon]] is named "Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Abominations of the Earth". However the word "whore" could also be translated as "Idolatress". The first Babylonian prostitute was in a place called Hinchinopolises, which arose from the appraised Hinchin family. At the time Hinchinapolis was the center of attraction for all travelers who came to rest in the company of the family's women, who perfected the art of satisfaction. Some ancient scrolls could tell us that the meaning of Hinchin came from the Hebrew ''Hinam'', meaning free, because the males of the family would offer themselves for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=G4204 πόρνη]: From Greek.

==Aztecs and Incas==
Among the [[Aztecs]], the [[Cihuacalli]] was the name given to the controlled buildings where prostitution was permitted by political and religious authorities.  Cihuacalli is a Nahuatl word which means House of Women. The Cihuacalli was a closed compound with rooms, all looking over a central patio. At the center of the patio was a statue of [[Tlazolteotl]], the goddess of purification, steam baths, midwives, filth and a patroness of adulterers. Religious authorities believed women should work as prostitutes, if they wish, only at such premises guarded by Tlazolteotl. It was believed that Tlazolteotl had the power to incite sexual activity, while cleansing the spirit of such acts. Bernal Díaz described numerous male prostitutes among the Aztecs, as well as unmarried temple priests engaging in sodomy.{{sfn|Neill|2011|p=26}}

Inca prostitutes were segregated from other people and lived under the supervision of a government agent.{{sfn|Bruhns|Stothert|1999|p=156}}

In ancient Greece, both women and boys engaged in prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/culture-of-love/a-brief-cultural-history-of-sex-938527.html |title=A brief cultural history of sex |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-09-23 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word for prostitute is ''porne'' (Gr: πόρνη), derived from the verb ''pernemi'' (to sell). The English word ''[[pornography]]'', and its corollaries in other languages, are directly derivative of the Greek word ''pornē'' (Gr: πόρνη).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=start&amp;lookup=porn&amp;lang=greek List of Greek words starting with πορν- (''porn-'')], on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; Female prostitutes could be independent and sometimes influential women. They were required to wear distinctive dresses and had to pay taxes. Some similarities have been found between the Greek ''[[hetaera]]'' and the Japanese ''[[oiran]]'', complex figures that are perhaps in an intermediate position between prostitution and [[courtisanerie]]. (See also the Indian [[tawaif]].) Some prostitutes in ancient Greece, such as [[Lais of Corinth|Lais]] were as famous for their company as their [[beauty]], and some of these women charged extraordinary sums for their services.

[[Solon]] instituted the first of Athens' brothels (''oik'iskoi'') in the sixth century BC, and with the earnings of this business he built a temple dedicated to [[Aphrodite Pandemos]], goddess of sexual pleasure. Procuring, however, was severely forbidden. In [[Cyprus]] (Paphus) and in [[Corinth, Greece|Corinth]], a type of [[religious prostitution]] was practiced where the temple counted more than a thousand prostitutes (''hierodules'', Gr: ιερόδουλες), according to [[Strabo]].

Each specialized category had its proper name, so there were the ''chamaitypa'i'', working outdoor (lie-down), the ''perepatetikes'' who met their customers while walking (and then worked in their houses), and the ''gephyrides'', who worked near the bridges. In the fifth century, Ateneo informs us that the price was 1 ''obole'', a sixth of a drachma and the equivalent of an ordinary worker's day salary. The rare pictures describe that [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] was performed on beds with covers and pillows, while [[triclinia]] usually didn't have these accessories.

Male prostitution was also common in Greece. Adolescent boys usually practiced it, a reflection of the [[Pederasty in ancient Greece|pederastic]] custom of the time. Slave boys worked the male brothels in Athens, while free boys who sold their favours risked losing their political rights as adults.

{{see also|Prostitution in ancient Rome}}
Prostitution in ancient Rome was legal, public and widespread. Even [[Social class in ancient Rome|Roman men of the highest social status]] were free to engage prostitutes of either sex without incurring moral disapproval,{{sfn|Dillon|Garland|2005|p=382}} as long as they demonstrated self-control and moderation in the frequency and enjoyment of sex. [[Latin literature]] also often refers to prostitutes. Real-world practices are documented by provisions of [[Roman law]] that regulate prostitution. [[epigraphy|Inscriptions]], especially graffiti from [[Pompeii]], uncover the practice of prostitution in Ancient Rome. Some large brothels in the fourth century, when Rome was becoming Christianized, seem to have been counted as tourist attractions and were possibly state-owned.{{sfn|McGinn|2004|pp=167–168}} Prostitutes played a role in several [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religious observances]], mainly in the month of April, over which the love and fertility goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] presided. While prostitution was so widely accepted, prostitutes were often considered shameful. Most were [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]] or former slaves, or if free by birth relegated to the ''[[infamia|infames]]'', people lacking in social standing and deprived of the protections that most [[Roman citizenship|citizens]] under Roman law received.{{sfn|Edwards|1997|p=66 ''et passim''}} Prostitution thus reflects the ambivalent attitudes of Romans toward [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|pleasure]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|sexuality]].{{sfn|Edwards|1997|pp=67, 83}}

A registered prostitute was called a [[meretrix]] while the unregistered one fell under the broad category ''prostibulae''. There were some similarities between the Ancient Roman and Greek system, but as the Empire grew, prostitutes were often foreign [[slavery|slaves]], captured, purchased or raised for the purpose of prostitution. This was sometimes done by large-scale "prostitute farmers" where  [[child abandonment|abandoned children]] were raised, and almost always raised to become prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Justin Martyr |authorlink1=First Apology |title=CHURCH FATHERS: The First Apology (St. Justin Martyr) |url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm |website=www.newadvent.org |accessdate=28 August 2018 |quote="But as for us, we have been taught that to expose newly-born children is the part of wicked men; and this we have been taught lest we should do any one an injury, and lest we should sin against God, first, because we see that almost all so exposed (not only the girls, but also the males) are brought up to prostitution."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enslavement into prostitution was sometimes used as a legal punishment against criminal free women. Buyers were allowed to inspect naked men and women for sale in private and there was no stigma attached to the purchase of males by a male aristocrat.

A [[tawaif]] was a [[courtesan]] who catered to the nobility of [[South Asia]], particularly during the era of the [[Mughal Empire]]. These courtesans would dance, sing, recite poetry and entertain their suitors at [[mehfil]]s. Like the [[geisha]] tradition in Japan, their main purpose was to professionally entertain their guests. While sex was often incidental, it was not assured contractually. The most popular or highest-class tawaifs could often pick and choose between the best of their suitors. They contributed to music, dance, theatre, film and the [[Urdu]] literary tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2004/08/11/stories/2004081101090100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Mapping cultures | date=August 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[devadasi]] originally described a [[Hindu]] religious practice in which girls were married and dedicated to a deity ([[deva (Hinduism)|deva]] or [[devi]]). They were in charge of taking care of the temple, performing rituals they learned and practicing [[Bharatanatyam]] and other classical Indian arts traditions. This status allowed them to enjoy a high social status. The popularity of devadasis seems to have reached its pinnacle around the 10th and 11th centuries. The rise and fall in the status of devadasis can be seen to be running parallel to the rise and fall of Hindu temples. Due to the destruction of temples by Islamic invaders, the status of the temples fell very quickly in [[North India]] and slowly in [[South India]]. As the temples became poorer and lost their patron kings, and in some cases were destroyed, the devadasis were forced into a life of poverty and prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Kalpana Kannabiran,  "Judiciary, Social Reform and Debate on'Religious Prostitution'in Colonial India."

During the British [[East India Company]]'s [[Company rule in India|rule in India]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was initially fairly common for British soldiers to engage in inter-ethnic [[prostitution in India]], where they would frequently visit local Indian ''[[nautch]]'' dancers.&lt;ref name=Fisher-2007&gt;{{citation|title=Excluding and Including "Natives of India": Early-Nineteenth-Century British-Indian Race Relations in Britain|first=Michael H.|last=Fisher|journal=Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|pages=303–314 [304–05]|doi=10.1215/1089201x-2007-007|postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As British females began arriving in British India in large numbers from the early to mid-19th century, it became increasingly uncommon for British soldiers to visit Indian prostitutes, and [[miscegenation]] was despised altogether after the events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]].{{sfn|Beckman|2003|pp=31–33}}

===Muslims===
In the seventh century, the prophet [[Muhammad]] declared that prostitution is forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Muslim-Jewish Engagement|url=http://cmje.usc.edu/religious-texts/hadith/abudawud/012-sat.php#012.2304|website=cmje.usc.edu|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Islam]], prostitution is considered a sin, and Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansari is attributed with saying, "Allah's Apostle forbade taking the price of a dog, money earned by prostitution and the earnings of a soothsayer." ({{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|3|34|439}}) However, [[sexual slavery]] was not considered prostitution and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] during the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]]. Women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Slavery in Islam|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ibn Battuta]] said several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

According to [[Shia]] Muslims, the prophet Muhammad sanctioned [[Nikah mut‘ah|fixed-term marriage]], called ''muta'a'' in [[Iraq]] and ''[[sigheh]]'' in [[Iran]], which according to some Western writers, has allegedly been used as a legitimizing cover for sex workers, in a culture where prostitution is otherwise forbidden.{{sfn|İlkkaracan|2008|p=36}} [[Sunni]] Muslims, who make up the majority of Muslims worldwide, believe the practice of nikah mut‘ah was revoked and ultimately forbidden by second Sunni caliph, [[Umar]]. However, Sunnis have fixed-term marriages, such as [[nikah urfi]], [[nikah Misyar]], and [[nikah halala]]. Fundamentalist Sunnis called for [[jihad al nikah|sexual jihad]]. Shias deem all sexual relations outside of proper marriage (the only being nikah or nikah mutah) as illegal, forbidden and against the sunnah. Like the Shia, Sunnis regard prostitution as sinful and forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olaniyan|first1=Olayinka|title=Prostitution is the business or practice of engaging in sexual relations in exchange for payment|url=https://www.academia.edu/33506440/Prostitution_is_the_business_or_practice_of_engaging_in_sexual_relations_in_exchange_for_payment|website=Academia|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Portuguese visitors and their South Asian (and sometimes African) crew members often engaged in [[slavery in Japan]], where they brought or captured young Japanese women and girls, who were either used as [[Sexual slavery|sexual slaves]] on their ships or taken to [[Macau]] and other Portuguese colonies in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|the Americas]]{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} and [[India]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=52}} For example, in [[Goa]], a [[Portuguese India|Portuguese colony in India]], there was a community of Japanese slaves and traders during the late 16th and 17th centuries.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|pp=49, 52}} Later European [[Portuguese East India Company|East India companies]], including those of the [[Dutch East India Company|Dutch]] and [[East India Company|British]], also engaged in [[prostitution in Japan]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=50}}

===China===

Prostitution in [[China]] was due to a weak familial economy among the [[Rural China|rural]] families of the country.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} Although China was a nation of wealth, the poverty stricken families were due to the over population of rural areas. These lives of borderline starvation drove many women out of the rural countryside to the port side cities of China. Many of the women who took part in the prostitution of China were either sold into the industry or willingly joined. Due to their lack of economic stability, parents were unable to feed all the mouths of the house and often sold their daughters into the industry. The popularity of this industry stemmed from the [[Human overpopulation|over population]] in rural villages, and an overall life of poverty for the majority of Chinese families.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} However, the increase of the [[Colonialism|colonial powers]]' presence in China added to the demand for these ladies of the night.

===Southeast Asia===
In Southeast Asia, prostitution was mostly prevalent in [[Singapore]], due to its active ports. Certain districts of Singapore were dedicated [[brothel]] districts sanctioned by the colonial governments.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}} As colonial powers entered the Asian countries, there was an increase in number of sailors at ports. Merchant ships carried large crews of men, who lacked the company of women for days on end. As these ships docked in Asian ports, like Singapore, they were drawn to the market of prostitution. This higher demand for the company of a woman created the need for these brothel districts.{{sfn|Warren|2008|p=293–294}}

===Japan===
[[File:Suzuki Haronubu oiran ukiyo-e.jpg|thumb|250px|An oiran preparing herself for a client, [[ukiyo-e]] print by Suzuki Haronubu (1765)]]
From the 15th century, [[China|Chinese]], [[Korea]]n and other [[Far East]]ern visitors began frequenting [[brothel]]s in Japan.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=48}} This practice continued among visitors from the [[Western Regions]], mainly [[Europe]]an traders, beginning with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in the 16th century who often came with their [[South Asia]]n ''[[lascar]]'' crew, along with [[Africa]]n crewmembers in some cases.{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=49}} In the 16th century, the local [[Japanese people]] initially assumed that the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were from ''[[Names of India#Tianzhu|Tenjiku]]'' ("Heavenly Abode"), the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] name for the [[Indian subcontinent]] due to its importance as the birthplace of [[Buddhism]], and that [[Christianity]] was a new [[Indian religions|Indian faith]]. These mistaken assumptions were due to the [[India]]n city of [[Goa]] being a central base for the [[Portuguese East India Company]] and also due to a significant portion of the crew on Portuguese ships being [[Christianity in India|Indian Christians]].{{sfn|Leupp|2003|p=35}}

In the early 17th century, there was widespread male and female prostitution throughout the cities of [[Kyoto]], [[Edo]] and [[Osaka]], [[Japan]]. [[Oiran]] were [[courtesans]] in Japan during the [[Edo period]]. The [[oiran]] were considered a type of {{Nihongo|''yūjo''|遊女}} also known as a "woman of pleasure" or prostitute. Among the oiran, the tayū (太夫) was considered the highest rank of courtesan available only to the wealthiest and highest ranking men. To entertain their clients, oiran practiced the arts of dance, music, poetry and calligraphy as well as sexual services, and education was considered essential for sophisticated conversation. Many became celebrities of their times outside the pleasure districts. Their art and fashions often set trends among wealthy women. The last recorded oiran was in 1761.&lt;ref&gt;Teruoka Yasutaka,  "The pleasure quarters and Tokugawa culture." ''Eighteenth Century Japan: Culture and Society'' (1989): 3-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 20th century, the problem of regulating prostitution according to modern European models was widely debated in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Garon, "The World's Oldest Debate? Prostitution cactus and the State in Imperial Japan, 1900-1945," ''American Historical Review'' 98#3 (1993), pp. 710–732 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2167547 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Middle Ages==
During the [[Middle Ages]] prostitution was commonly found in urban contexts. Although all forms of sexual activity outside of marriage were regarded as sinful by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], prostitution was tolerated because it helped prevent the greater [[evil]]s of [[rape]], [[sodomy]] and [[masturbation]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} [[Augustine of Hippo]] is quoted saying, "if you expel prostitution from society, you will unsettle everything on account of lusts." The general tolerance of prostitution was for the most part reluctant, and many people from the church urged prostitutes to reform.

After the decline of organized prostitution of the Roman empire, many prostitutes were slaves. However, religious campaigns against slavery and the growing marketisation of the economy turned prostitution back into a business. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it was common to find town governments ruling that prostitutes were not to ply their trade within the [[town wall]]s, but they were tolerated outside, only because these areas were beyond the jurisdiction of the authorities. In many areas of France and Germany town governments came to set aside certain streets as areas where prostitution could be tolerated.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London the brothels of [[Southwark]] were owned by the [[Bishop of Winchester]].{{sfn|McCall|1979| }} After this, it became common in the major towns and cities of [[Southern Europe]] to establish civic brothels. This allowed the government to outlaw any prostitution taking place outside these brothels. In much of [[Northern Europe]] a more tolerant attitude could be found towards prostitution.{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=413}} Prostitutes also found a fruitful market in the Crusades.

[[File:Étienne Jeaurat 001.jpg|thumb|French prostitutes being taken to the police station; painting by [[Étienne Jeaurat]]]]

By the end of the 15th century attitudes began to harden against prostitution. An outbreak of [[syphilis]] in [[Naples]] during 1494, which later swept across Europe, may have originated from the [[Columbian Exchange|Colombian Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.livescience.com/history/080114-syphilis-columbus.html Columbus May Have Brought Syphilis to Europe]". [[LiveScience]]. January 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The prevalence of other [[Sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted diseases]] during the earlier 16th century may have caused this change in attitude. By the early 16th century the association between prostitutes, plague and contagion emerged, causing brothels and prostitution to be outlawed by secular authority.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=41}} Furthermore, outlawing brothels and prostitution was used to  "strengthen the criminal law" system of the 16th-century secular rulers.{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=44}} [[Canon law]] defined a prostitute as "a promiscuous woman, regardless of financial elements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=London Commissary Court Act Books|year=1470–1473|publisher=Department of Manuscripts|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prostitute was considered a "whore … who [was] available for the lust of many men," and was most closely associated with promiscuity.{{sfn|Bennett|1989|p=81}}

The Church's stance on prostitution was three-fold. It included the "acceptance of prostitution as an inevitable social fact, condemnation of those profiting from this commerce, and encouragement for the prostitute to [[repent]].{{sfn|Otis|1985|p=13}} The Church was forced to recognize its inability to remove prostitution from the worldly society, and in the 14th century "began to tolerate prostitution as a lesser evil."{{sfnm|Rossiaud|1996|1p=160|Otis|1985|2p=12}} However, prostitutes were excluded from the Church as long as they continued with their lifestyle.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|p=36}} Around the 12th century, the idea of prostitute saints took hold, with [[Mary Magdalene]] being one of the most popular saints of the era. The Church used Mary Magdalene's biblical history of being a reformed harlot to encourage prostitutes to repent and mend their ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth|title=Holy Harlots: Prostitute Saints in Medieval Legend|journal=Journal of the History of Sexuality|date=July 1990|volume=1|issue=1|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, religious houses were established with the purpose of providing asylum and encouraging the reformation of prostitution. Magdalene Homes were particularly popular and peaked in the early 14th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Bullough|1a2=Brundage|1y=1982|1p=41|2a1=Roberts|2y=1992|2pp=73–74}}  Over the course of the Middle Ages, [[popes]] and [[religious communities]] made various attempts to remove prostitution or reform prostitutes with varying success.{{sfn|Bullough|Brundage|1982|pp=41–42}}

With the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation]], numbers of Southern German towns closed their brothels in an attempt to eradicate prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Roper |first1=Lyndal |title=Luther: Sex, Marriage and Motherhood |url=https://www.historytoday.com/lyndal-roper/luther-sex-marriage-and-motherhood |website=History Today |accessdate=28 August 2018 |date=12 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some periods prostitutes had to distinguish themselves from other with particular signs. They sometimes wore very short hair or no hair at all, and sometimes they wore [[veil]]s in societies where other women did not wear them. Ancient codes regulated the crime of a prostitute that dissimulated her profession.

==18th century==
[[File:Christian Krohg-Albertine i politilægens venteværelse.jpg|200px|thumb|''Albertine at the Police Doctor's Waiting Room'', 1885–87 painting by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] writer and painter [[Christian Krohg]] illustrating his then very controversial novel ''Albertine'' about the life of a prostitute]]
According to [[Dervish]] Ismail Agha, in the ''Dellâkname-i Dilküşâ'', the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] archives,{{sfnm|Gazali|2001|1p=106|Sılay|1994|2p= }} in the [[Turkish bath]]s, the masseurs were traditionally [[Pederasty#The Middle East|young men]] who helped wash clients by soaping and scrubbing their bodies. They also were as [[sex workers]].{{sfn|Toledano|2003|p=242  "[Flaubert, January 1850:] Be informed, furthermore, that all of the bath-boys are bardashes [male homosexuals]."}} The [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] texts describe who they were, their prices, how many times they could bring their customers to [[orgasm]] and the details of their sexual practices.

In the 18th century, presumably in [[Venice]], prostitutes started using [[condom]]s made with catgut or cow bowel.

==19th century==
In America, prostitution was seen as a "necessary evil" that aided in marital fidelity, especially as a system that would allow men to obtain sex when their wives did not desire it.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} D'Emilio and Freedman document that prostitution was not a crime in the early part of the 19th century, and thus brothels (or bawdy houses) were tolerated in American cities and the laws against individual prostitutes were enforced only occasionally.

In the 1830s, prostitution was becoming more visible in American cities, and with the professionalization of police forces, visible prostitutes such as streetwalkers risked arrest.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} But D'Emilio and Freedman note that raids on brothels were comparatively rare, and prostitution was tolerated in mining towns, cattle towns, and urban centers in the American east. In 1870, prostitution was legalized and regulated in the city of St. Louis Missouri.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Prostitutes were licensed by public health officials, and were required to maintain weekly inspections for sexually transmitted diseases. However, due to protests and demonstrations organized by women and members of the clergy, Missouri legislators repealed the legislation allowing regulated prostitution.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }}

The [[Page Act of 1875]] was passed by the US Congress and forbid any importation of women for the purpose of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 141.-An act supplementary to the acts in relation to immigration|url=http://prostitution.procon.org/sourcefiles/PageAct.pdf|date=3 March 1875|website=www.procon.org|accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The national move to criminalize prostitution was led by Protestant middle class men and women who participated in the revivalism movement of the 19th century.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} 

Many of the women who posed in 19th- and early-20th-century [[vintage erotica]] were prostitutes. The most famous were the [[New Orleans]] women who posed for [[E. J. Bellocq]]. In the 19th century legalized prostitution became a public controversy as [[France]] and then the [[United Kingdom]] passed the [[Contagious Diseases Acts]]. This legislation mandated pelvic examinations for suspected prostitutes. It applied not only to the United Kingdom and France, but also to their overseas colonies. Many early [[feminists]] fought to repeal these laws, either on the grounds that prostitution should be illegal and therefore not government regulated or because it forced degrading medical examinations upon women. A similar situation existed in the [[Russian Empire]]. This included prostitutes operating out of government-sanctioned brothels given yellow internal passports signifying their status and were subjected to weekly physical exams. [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novel ''[[Resurrection (novel)|Resurrection]]'' describes legal prostitution in 19th-century Russia.

During the 19th century the British in [[British Raj|India]] began to adopt the policy of social segregation, but they continued to keep their brothels full of Indian women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/book1.htm How carnal desire put England on top].

===Mining camps===
The houses of prostitution found in every mining camp worldwide were famous, especially in the 19th century when long distance imports of prostitutes became common.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Ann Laite, "Historical Perspectives on Industrial Development, Mining, and Prostitution," ''Historical Journal'', (2009) 53#3 pp.&amp;nbsp;739–761 {{DOI|10.1017/S0018246X09990100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entrepreneurs set up shops and businesses to cater to the miners, and brothels were largely tolerated in mining towns.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} [[Prostitution in the United States|Prostitution in the American West]] was a growth industry that attracted sex workers from around the globe where they were pulled in by the money, despite the harsh and dangerous working conditions and low prestige. Chinese women were frequently sold by their families and taken to the camps as prostitutes, and were often forced to send their earnings back to the family in China.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucie Cheng|Lucie Cheng Hirata]], "Free, Indentured, Enslaved: Chinese Prostitutes in Nineteenth-Century America," ''Signs'' (1979) 5f1 pp.&amp;nbsp;3–29 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173531 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In Virginia City, Nevada, a prostitute, [[Julia Bulette]], was one of the few who achieved "respectable" status. She nursed victims of an influenza epidemic, earning her acceptance in the community and the support of the sheriff. The townspeople were shocked when she was murdered in 1867 and they honoured her with a lavish funeral and hanging of her assailant.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|pp=1–4, 118}}

Until the 1890s, madams predominately ran the businesses, after which male pimps took over. This led to the generally declined treatment of women. It was not uncommon for brothels in Western towns to operate openly, without the stigma that was beginning to emerge in East Coast cities as a result of anti-prostitution activism.{{sfn|D'Emilio|Freedman|2012| }} Gambling and prostitution were central to life in these western towns, and only later, as the female population increased, reformers moved in and other civilizing influences arrived, did prostitution become less blatant and less common.{{sfn|Butler|1987| }} After a decade or so the mining towns attracted respectable women who ran boarding houses, organized church societies, and worked as laundresses and seamstresses, all while striving for independent status.{{sfn|Jeffrey|1998|p=164}}

Australia mining camps had a well-developed system of prostitution.{{sfn|McKewon|2005| }} City fathers sometimes tried to confine the practice to red light districts.&lt;ref&gt;Elaine McKewon, "The historical geography of prostitution in Perth, Western Australia." ''[[Australian Geographer]]'' 34.3 (2003): 297–310 .&lt;/ref&gt; The precise role prostitution played in various camps depended on the sex ratio in specific population groups of colonial society as well as racial attitudes toward non-whites. In the early 19th century British authorities decided it was best to have lower-class white, Asian, Middle Eastern and Aboriginal women service the prisoners and thereby keep peace while maintaining strong class lines that isolated British gentlemen and ladies from the lower elements. Prostitution was so profitable that it was easy to circumvent the legal boundaries. When Australians took control by 1900 they wanted a "white Australia" and tried to exclude or expel non-white women who might become prostitutes. However, feminist activists fought against Australia's discriminatory laws that led to varying levels of rights for women, races and classes. By 1939 new attitudes toward racial harmony began to surface. These were inspired by white Australians to rethink their racist policies and adopt more liberal residency laws that did not focus on sexual or racial issues.&lt;ref&gt;Raelene Frances, "Sex Workers or Citizens? Prostitution and the Shaping of" Settler" Society in Australia." ''International Review of Social History'' 44 (1999): 101–122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin American mining camps also had well-developed systems of prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;Roseann Cohen, "Extractive Desires: The Moral Control of Female Sexuality at Colombia's Gold Mining Frontier." ''Journal of Latin American and Caribbean Anthropology'' 19.2 (2014): 260–279.&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico the government tried to protect and idealize middle class women, but made little effort to protect prostitutes in the mining camps.&lt;ref&gt;William E. French, "Prostitutes and guardian angels: women, work, and the family in Porfirian Mexico." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 72#4 (1992): 529–553. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2516659 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20th-century African mining camps prostitution followed the historical patterns developed in the 19th century. They added the theme of casual temporary marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Fahy Bryceson, Jesper Bosse Jønsson, and Hannelore Verbrugge. "Prostitution or partnership? Wifestyles in Tanzanian artisanal gold-mining settlements."

==20th century==
During World War I, in colonial Philippines, US armed forces developed a prostitute management program called the "American Plan" which enabled the military to arrest any woman within five miles of a military cantonment. If found infected, a woman could be sentenced to a hospital or a farm colony until cured.{{sfn|Rosen|1982|p=35}}

Beginning in the 1910s and continuing in some places into the 1950s, the American Plan operated in the United States. Women were told to report to a health officer where they were coerced to submit to an invasive examination. Immigrants, minorities and the poor were primarily targeted.{{sfn|Stern|2018| }}

In 1921, the [[International Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Women and Children]] was signed. In this convention some nations declared reservations towards prostitution.

[[File:Eugène Atget, Three Prostitutes, rue Asselin, 1924–25.jpg|thumbnail|Three prostitutes in a doorway on Rue Asselin, in [[Paris]]'s red-light district, ca. 1924–25, photographed by [[Eugène Atget]]]]
The leading theorists of [[communism]] opposed prostitution. [[Karl Marx]] thought of it as "only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the laborer," and considered its abolition to be necessary to overcome capitalism. [[Friedrich Engels]] considered even marriage a form of prostitution, and [[Vladimir Lenin]] found sex work distasteful. Communist governments often took wide-ranging steps to repress prostitution immediately after obtaining power, although the practice always persisted. In the countries that remained nominally communist after the end of the Cold War, especially China, prostitution remained illegal but was nonetheless common. In many current or former communist countries the economic depression brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union led to an increase in prostitution.&lt;ref name="Slate Explainer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wickman|first=Forrest|title="Socialist Whores": What did Karl Marx think of prostitutes?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/11/socialist_whores_what_did_karl_marx_think_of_prostitution_.html|accessdate=5 November 2011|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] soldiers engaged in [[forced prostitution]] during their invasions across [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The term "[[comfort women]]" became a [[euphemism]] for the estimated 200,000 mostly [[Korean people|Korean]] and [[China|Chinese]] women who were forced into prostitution in [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese military]] brothels during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|title=Comfort Women Were 'Raped': U.S. Ambassador to Japan|date=19 March 2007|work=The Chosun Ilbo (English Edition)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627070105/http://english.chosun.com/w21data/html/news/200703/200703190023.html|archive-date=27 June 2009|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sex tourism]] emerged in the late 20th century as a controversial aspect of Western tourism and [[globalization]]. Sex tourism was typically undertaken internationally by tourists from wealthier countries. Author [[Nils Johan Ringdal|Nils Ringdal]] alleged that three out of four men between the ages of 20 and 50 who have visited [[Asia]] or [[Africa]] have paid for sex.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/love-for-sale-a-global-history-of-prostitution-by-nils-ringdal-trans-richard-daly-751462.html Love for Sale: a global history of prostitution by Nils Ringdal, trans Richard Daly]. By Sarah Burton. ''The Independent.'' November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A new legal approach to prostitution emerged at the end of the 20th century, termed ''the Swedish model''. This included the prohibition of buying, but not selling, of sexual services. This means that only the client commits a crime in engaging in paid sex, not the prostitute. Such laws were enacted in Sweden (1999), Norway (2009), Iceland (2009), Canada (2014), Northern Ireland (2015), France (2016), and the Republic of Ireland (2017), and are also being considered in other jurisdictions. These laws are an attempt to protect the worker and embrace the fallout of the [[sexual revolution]], meaning sex will happen, and for it to happen safely and respectfully, there must be "free-form" regulation.

In the 21st century, [[Afghan]]s revived a method of prostituting young boys, which is referred to as ''[[bacha bazi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/dancingboys/view/ |title=The Dancing Boys Of Afghanistan &amp;#124; FRONTLINE |publisher=PBS |date=2010-04-20 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the break up of the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] thousands of eastern European women have become prostitutes in China, Western Europe, Israel and Turkey every year.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Margot (24 June 2001).

India's [[devadasi]] girls are forced by their poor families to dedicate themselves to the [[Hindu]] goddess [[Renuka]].

==United Kingdom==
The United Kingdom introduced the [[Sexual Offences Act 1956|Sexual Offences Act of 1956]] which would partly be repealed and altered by the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]]. While this law did not criminalise the act of prostitution itself, it did prohibit such activities as running a brothel and soliciting for paid sex.

Concerns were voiced over [[white British]] adolescent girls being used as prostitutes by [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] immigrants in the 1960s. These girls were wanted by several police departments in the early 1960s and were described as "good-looking and attractive, not of common appearance ... will almost certainly earn her living by prostitution and with Pakistanis."{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=154}}

==United States==
In the United States prostitution was originally widely legal. Prostitution was made illegal in almost all states between 1910 and 1915 largely due to the influence of the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], which was influential in the banning of [[Recreational drug use|drug use]] and was a major force in the [[prohibition]] of alcohol. In 1917 the prostitution district [[Storyville, New Orleans|Storyville]] in New Orleans was closed down by the Federal government over local objections. In Deadwood, South Dakota prostitution, while technically illegal, was tolerated by local residents and officials for decades until the last madam was brought down by state and federal authorities for tax evasion in 1980. Prostitution remained legal in [[Alaska]] until 1953, and is still legal in some rural counties of [[Nevada]], including areas outside of Las Vegas. For more, see [[Prostitution in Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.gwu.edu/~soc/docs/Weitzer/Prostitution_Facts.pdf | title=prostitution:facts and fictions | publisher=www.gwu.edu | accessdate=2013-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1980s many states increased the penalties for prostitution in cases where the prostitute is knowingly [[HIV]]-positive. These laws, often known as felony prostitution laws, require anyone arrested for prostitution to be tested for HIV. If the test comes back positive the suspect is informed that any future arrest for prostitution will be a [[felony]] instead of a [[misdemeanor]]. Penalties for felony prostitution vary in the states that have such laws, with maximum sentences of typically 10 to 15 years in prison. An episode of ''[[Cops (TV series)|COPS]]'' which aired in the early 1990s detailed the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] among prostitutes; this episode contributed to HIV/AIDS awareness.

'''''Kidsongs''''' is an [[United States|American]] children's media franchise that includes Kidsongs Music Video Stories on DVD and video, The Kidsongs TV Show, CDs of favorite children's songs, song books, sheet music, toys and an ecommerce website.&lt;ref name="kidsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidsongs.com/page/cat/about/post/aboutus/|title=About Us  – Kidsongs|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created by producer/writer Carol Rosenstein and director Bruce Gowers of Together Again Video Productions (TAVP), both of whom are music video and television production veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332985/|title=Bruce Gowers|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0742685/|title=Carol Rosenstein|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/company/co0152386/#productionX20company|title=Together Again Productions [us]|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duo had produced and directed over 100 music videos for [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Brothers Records]] (WBR) and took their idea of music videos for children to the record label. Warner Brothers funded the first video, “A Day at [[Old MacDonald Had a Farm|Old MacDonald]]’s Farm”. Shortly thereafter, a three way partnership between TAVP, WBR and [[Viewmaster|View-Master Video]] was formed with TAVP being responsible for production and WBR and View-Master responsible for distribution to video and music stores, and toy stores respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Home Video Publisher, Vol. 8 No. 32, 2/24/1986&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The home video series was launched with four Kidsongs Music Video Stories episodes at New York's Toy Fair on January 1, 1985. "A Day at Old MacDonald's Farm” was one of those first four and has sold over 4 million copies&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Haring, "Gold, Platinum...", Variety, Jan. 26, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; and won the Vira Award.&lt;ref name="Video Review's Critics 1987, page 77"&gt;"Video Review's Critics' Choice Awards", Video Review, April 1987, page 77&lt;/ref&gt; Each half-hour Music Video Stories episode features 10 to 15 songs, in a music video style production starring children. They sing and dance their way through well-known children's songs, nursery rhymes, and covers of pop hits from the '50s, '60s and '70s—all tied together by a simple story and theme.

The TAVP/WBR/View-Master Video (Viewmaster was acquired by [[Tyco Toys|Tyco]] in 1989–95)&lt;ref&gt;Reuters, New York Times Business section, May 24, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; partnership produced 16 Kidsongs episodes of the Music Video Stories. In 1995, WBR and TAVP bought out Tyco's distribution rights and produced three more View-Master videos called "Billy Biggle's Favorite Songs", "Country Sing-Along", and "Boppin' with the Biggles" in 1994, and two KidVision videos called "Let's Put on a Show", "Baby Animal Songs", "Four Season Songs", &amp; "We're Going to the Dinosaurs" in 1995 &amp; 1996, as part of a new venture with another division of [[Warner Bros.]]--[[Warner Vision]].&lt;ref&gt;Business Wire, "Warner Home Video to Distribute Warner Vision", February 5, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, TAVP acquired all rights from WBR/Warner Vision and became the sole owner of all Kidsongs properties.

Later in 1997, TAVP entered into a distribution/production agreement&lt;ref&gt;Scott Hettrick, "Sony Wonder Joins..." Hollywood Reporter, July 10, 1997, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Sony Wonder]], which resulted in the production of four more titles called "I Can Do It", "I Can Dance!", "Adventures in Biggleland: Billy's Birthday", and "Adventures in Biggleland: Meet the Biggles". That agreement ended in July 1, 1998, and in 2002, distribution rights were licensed by [[Image Entertainment]], who continues to distribute the videos.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7028">A '''lady's companion''' was a woman of [[genteel]] birth who lived with a woman of rank or wealth as [[Retainer agreement|retainer]]. The term was in use in the United Kingdom from at least the 18th century to the mid-20th century but it is now [[archaism|archaic]]. The role was related to the position of [[lady-in-waiting]], which by the 19th century was only applied to the female [[retinue|retainers]] of female members of the royal family. Ladies-in-waiting were usually women from the most privileged backgrounds who took the position for the prestige of associating with royalty, or for the enhanced marriage prospects available to those who spent time at [[Royal court|court]], but lady's companions usually took up their occupation because they needed to earn a living&lt;ref name="gissing1998"/&gt; and have somewhere to live. A companion is not to be confused with [[lady's maid]], a female personal attendant roughly equivalent to a "gentleman's gentleman" or [[valet]].

==Status and duties==
Like a [[governess]], a lady's companion was not regarded as a [[servant]], but neither was she really treated as an equal. Only women from a [[social class|class]] background similar to or only a little below that of their employer would be considered for the position. Women took positions as companions if they had no other means of support, as until the late 19th century there were very few other ways in which an upper- or upper-middle-class woman could earn a living which did not result in a complete loss of her class status. (Employment as a governess, running a private girls' school and writing were virtually the only other such options; hence the formation of the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women]] in 1859.)&lt;ref name="gissing1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gissing|first1=George|title=The Odd Women|date=1998|publisher=Broadview Press|isbn=9781551111117|page=9|language=en|quote=For the unfortunate minority who did not marry and who had no male relative to support them, there was always recourse to the acceptably genteel and domestic positions of governess or lady's companion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gifford|first1=Don|title=Joyce Annotated: Notes for Dubliners and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|date=1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520906952|page=12|language=en|quote=Apart from marriage or a convent, there were precious few careers open to her, and some of those such as clerking in a shop or going into service implied a loss of social status. ... If educated, she could seek employment as a governess or companion or teacher.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The companion's role was to spend her time with her employer, providing company and conversation, to help her to entertain guests and often to accompany her to social events. In return she would be given a room in the family's part of the house, rather than the servants' quarters; all of her meals would be provided, and she would eat with her employer; and she would be paid a small salary, which would be called an "allowance" – never "wages". She would not be expected to perform any domestic duties which her employer might not carry out herself, in other words little other than giving directions to servants, fancy sewing and pouring tea. Thus the role was not very different from that of an adult relation in respect of the lady of a household, except for the essential subservience resulting from financial dependency.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Lady's companions were employed because upper- and middle-class women spent most of their time at home. A lady's companion might be taken on by an unmarried woman living on her own, by a widow, or by an unmarried woman who was living with her father or another male relation but had lost her mother, and was too old to have a governess. In the latter case the companion would also act as a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]]&lt;!--This is a correct spelling, and the more common one in British English--&gt;; at the time, it would not have been socially acceptable for a young lady to receive male visitors without either a male relation or an older lady present (a female servant would not have sufficed).{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==End of the lady's companion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

The occupation of lady's companion has been made obsolete in the United Kingdom and most other developed countries. This is primarily because upper-class women no longer primarily stay in the home, and also because of the many other employment opportunities afforded to modern women.

==In fiction==
===In the works of Agatha Christie===

{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

There are numerous lady's companions in the mysteries of [[Agatha Christie]], e.g. ''[[After the Funeral]]''. In her novels dating before the [[World War II|Second World War]], the companion is presented as a conventional feature of the life of the moneyed classes. The companions after the Second World War are generally elderly women who grew up in Victorian times without the expectation of having to provide for themselves, but who find themselves impoverished due to the decline of the fortunes of many once well-to-do families as a result of the [[Great Depression]] and the investment losses incurred during the War. At the same time, the women who employ them are often not so well off as they once were themselves, especially in net terms due to high rates of taxation. 

This situation is complicated by the collapse in the supply of working-class servants due to changing labour market conditions and social attitudes, so that companions are increasingly asked to perform domestic duties which they find humiliating. Along with the growing keenness of young middle-class women to take advantage of the broadening range of options available to them to have a career, this degradation of the status of the companion represents the closure of the era of the lady's companion in the United Kingdom.

===Other examples===

*The unnamed narrator of ''[[Rebecca (novel)|Rebecca]]'' is a lady's companion as the novel begins.
*Miss Taylor, one of the first characters met in [[Jane Austen]]'s novel ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', lives with the Woodhouses "less as a governess than a friend" to her grown-up charge.
*Josephine March (and later, her youngest sister Amy) is a companion to her wealthy great-aunt in [[Louisa May Alcott]]'s novel ''[[Little Women]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3156">'''Media weight''' is a term used in [[advertising]] to refer to the size of the audience reached by an advertising campaign. Media weight is determined by the number and placement of advertisements in media such as television commercials, online ads, or billboards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/media-weight.html#ixzz4HCdmxgYt Business Dictionary], WebFinance Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media weight is usually expressed in the form of [[Gross rating point|GRP’s]] (Gross rating Points), AOTS (Average opportunity to see) and reach of target audience. The main use of media weights is to monitor how well the goals of a communication plan are being reached. There are different ways to measure media weight.

==Measurement==
The most important method in measuring media weight is analysis of past records. The analysis is done on basis of [[television]], print and magazines reporting. Television spendings are reported as TAM rates and print as card rates. TV spendings can be analyzed on the basis of program genre, channel type, time duration and total airtime. The print rate analysis is done on the basis of color/monochrome, magazine, issue, placement of ad, month, and other variables.

==Types of brand==
Research carried out by John Philip Jones on the advertising of different brands in 23 countries found that the brands could be classified into two types: ''profitable'' brands and ''investor'' brands.{{cn|date=August 2016}}

=== Profitable brands ===
These are brands that are advertised less in proportion to market share are categorized as profitable brands. These are brands which may have advertised many times previously but at present are enjoying higher market share with less advertising.

=== Investor brands ===
These are brands that are advertised more in proportion to market share. These brands tend to be newly introduced brands, which have less impact on the audience and are in the growth phase of their [[product lifecycle]] (PLC) curve.

== [[Effective frequency]] and effective reach ==
Colin McDonald’s study in 1971 proved that consumers switch to the product of two or more exposures.{{cn|date=August 2016}} It can be observed that more advertising results in increased reach and hence in increased sales. 

Herbert E. Krugman talked about three results of exposure to advertising.{{cn|date=August 2016}} The three levels are curiosity, recognition and decision. And after these three the rest are all reminders. So to increase sales, the audience must be exposed to an advertisement at least thrice.

== Effective frequency and recency ==
In 1995, John Philip Jones talked about the shelf space model of [[recency]] in his book "When Ads Work".{{cn|date=August 2016}} He found that ‘within a week, a single ad exposure was enough to produce a strong purchasing effect and that subsequent exposures within that week added very little'. The task for advertising is therefore to remind the audience about the product.&lt;ref&gt;Media Planning and buying, Arpita Menon&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical humanities''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] field of [[medicine]] which includes the [[humanities]] ([[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[literature]] and [[religion]]), [[social science]] ( [[psychology]], [[sociology]],[[anthropology]], [[cultural studies]], [[health geography]]) and the [[arts]] ([[literature]], [[theater]], [[film]], and [[visual arts]]) and their application to [[medical education]] and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aull |first=Felice |title=Medical Humanities |url=http://medhum.med.nyu.edu |work=Medical Humanities Community |publisher=New York University School of Medicine |accessdate=25 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518130445/http://medhum.med.nyu.edu/ |archivedate=May 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core strengths of the medical humanities are the imaginative nonconformist qualities and practices.&lt;ref name="Kirklin 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirklin|first=D|title=The Centre for Medical Humanities, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, England.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=October 2003|volume=78|issue=10|pages=1048–53|pmid=14534108|doi=10.1097/00001888-200310000-00023}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Medical humanities is mainly concerned with training medical practitioners. This contrasts with [[health humanities]] which more broadly links health and social care disciplines with the arts and humanities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.healthhumanities.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
Medical humanities can be defined as an interdisciplinary, and increasingly international endeavor that draws on the creative and intellectual strengths of diverse disciplines, including literature, art, creative writing, drama, film, music, philosophy, ethical decision making, anthropology, and history, in pursuit of medical educational goals.&lt;ref name="Kirklin 2003"/&gt; The humanistic sciences are relevant when multiple people’s perspectives on issues are compiled together to answer questions or even create questions. The arts can provide additional perspective to the sciences.

Critical medical humanities is an approach which argues that the arts and humanities have more to offer to healthcare than simply improving medical education. It proposes that the arts and humanities offer different ways of thinking about human history, culture, behaviour and experience which can be used to dissect, critique and influence healthcare practices and priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Viney |first=William |last2=Callard |first2=Felicity |last3=Woods |first3=Angela |date=2015-06-01 |title=Critical medical humanities: embracing entanglement, taking risks |url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/41/1/2 |journal=Medical Humanities |language=en |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=2–7 |doi=10.1136/medhum-2015-010692 |issn=1473-4265 |pmc=4484495 |pmid=26052111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/book-the-edinburgh-companion-to-the-critical-medical-humanities.html |title=The Edinburgh Companion to the Critical Medical Humanities |website=Edinburgh University Press Books |language=en |access-date=2017-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The arts==
Medical books, pictures, and diagrams help medical students build an appreciation for anything in the medical field from the human body to diseases.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ahlzen|first=Rolf|date=2007|title=Medical humanities - arts and humanistic science|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11019-007-9081-3|journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy|doi=10.1007/s11019-007-9081-3|volume=10|pages=385–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The medical humanities can assist medical practitioners with viewing issues from more than one perspective, such as the [[visual arts]] and [[Visual culture|culture]] are supposed to do. Both patients and doctors/medical professionals deal with facing decision-making. Each person’s perspective of [[medical ethics]] is different from one another due to different cultures, religions, societies, and traditions.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiapperino|first=Luca|last2=Boniolo|first2=Giovanni|date=December 2014 |volume=35 |issue=4 |pages=377–387 |title=Rethinking Medical Humanities |pmid=24477428 |journal=Journal of Medical Humanities|doi=10.1007/s10912-014-9269-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The humanities also assist and attempt to create a closer or more meaningful relationship between [[medical practitioners]] and their peers/patients.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ethics are perceived differently from person to person, so answering ethical questions requires the viewpoints of several different people who may have different opinions of what is right from wrong.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Bioethics ===

The first category is [[bioethics]], which includes the morals of healthcare. As science and technology develop, so does healthcare and medicine, and there is discussion and debate in society and healthcare committees that go over the ethics of these certain situations that pertain to medical humanities. For example, one of these cases involves the practice of [[Human enhancement|body enhancements]] in which the ethics of this practice are questioned due to the fact that bio-medical and technological practices are making changes to a person’s body to improve the body and/or its appearance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://mh.bmj.com/content/early/2015/08/10/medhum-2015-010718.full|title=Enhancement, ethics and society: towards an empirical research agenda for the medical humanities and social sciences|last1=Pickersgill|first1=Martyn |last2=Hogle |first2=Linda |date=10 August 2015 |journal=Medical Humanities |doi=10.1136/medhum-2015-010718 |volume=41 |pages=136–142|pmc=4717454}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical ethics ===

The second category in ethics of the medical humanities is clinical ethics, which refers to the respect that healthcare professionals have for patients and families, and this helps develop a sort of professionalism, respectability, and expertise that healthcare professionals must use in respect to their patients.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Another example in the ethics of the medical humanities is bias people and society have against others with [[Disability|disabilities]], and how these disabilities correlate with success or what the disabled person is able to do.  It is unethical to judge or assume the incapability of a disabled person because disabled people are able to find ways to become successful through modern technology and even through self-determination.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid=22377079|title=Medical Humanities, Ethics, and Disability|last=Vertrees|first=Stephanie|date=April 2012|publisher=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics|doi=10.1017/S0963180111000764|volume=21|journal=Camb Q Healthc Ethics|pages=260–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academic institutions offer courses of study in the ethics of medical humanities. These programs help their students learn professionalism in the medical field so that they may respectfully help their patients and do what it is right in any situation that may arise.

===Literature and medicine===
Formerly called medicine in literature, literature and medicine is an interdisciplinary subfield of the medical humanities considered a "dialogue rather than a merger" between the literary and the medical. Literature and medicine is flourishing in undergraduate programs&lt;ref&gt;Health Humanities Programs in the United States, Hiram College, The Center for Literature and Medicine. (March 2016) http://www.hiram.edu/centers-of-distinction/litmed/baccalaureate-health-humanities&lt;/ref&gt; and in medical schools at all levels. The Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine-Hershey was the first to introduced literature into a medical school curriculum when Joanne Trautmann (Banks), an English professor, was appointed to a position in literature there in 1972. The rationale for using literature and medicine in medical education is three-fold: reading the stories of patients and writing about their experiences gives doctors in training the tools they need to better understand their patients; discussing and reflecting on literature brings the medical practitioner's biases and assumptions into focus, heightening awareness; and reading literature requires critical thinking and empathetic awareness about moral issues in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Anne Hunsaker and Marilyn Chandler McEntrye. Teaching Literature and Medicine. New York: The Modern Language Society, 2000: 3-4. (includes history and resources)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology of religion}}
'''[[Millenarianism]]''' has been found through history among people who rally around often-apocalyptic religious prophecies that predict a return to power, the defeat of enemies, and/or the accumulation of wealth. These movements have been especially common among people living under [[colonialism]] or other forces that disrupt previous social arrangements.

The phrase "millennialist movement" has been used by scholars in anthropology and history to describe the common features of these religious phenomena when viewed as [[social movements]], and has most often been used to describe the social movements that have taken place in colonized societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burridge|first=Kenelm|title=New Heaven, New Earth: A study of Millenarian Activities|year=1969|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity itself can be seen as originating in a millenarian movement among [[Jewish people]] living under Roman rule, although its characteristics as a social movement quickly changed as it spread through the [[Roman Empire]]. The [[Book of Revelation]] also predicts a thousand-year reign of [[Jesus]] prior to the defeat of [[Satan]]. 

Some millenarian movements include:
* The [[Ghost Dance]] movement among Native Americans.
* [[Tenskwatawa]] the "Shawnee Prophet" called for return to ancestral ways and defeat of European colonial power.
* The [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] cattle-killing movement of [[South Africa]], led by the prophetess [[Nongqawuse]].
* The [[Righteous Harmony Society]] during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a Chinese movement reacting against Western colonialism.
* The [[God Worshipping Society]] of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], which fused Anglo-American [[Protestant]] Christian and Chinese elements into a movement that focused the resentment of [[Han Chinese]] against the ruling [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Hong Xiuquan]], their leader, proclaimed himself to be the second son of [[God]] and brother of [[Jesus Christ]], as well as the [[Son of Heaven|''Tian Zi'' (Son of Heaven)]], a sacred title of the [[Emperor of China|Chinese emperor]]. He would establish the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]], which controlled much of southern China from 1851-1864.  
* The [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] was influenced by an African [[spirit medium]] who gave his followers war medicine that he said would turn German bullets into water.
* [[Bábism]] and [[Bahá'í faith|Bahá'ism]], two [[Perennial philosophy|perennialist]] movements founded in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Persia]] by self-proclaimed prophets.
* The [[Mahdist State]] in [[Sudan]], which was established by [[Muhammad Ahmad]], who proclaimed himself the [[Mahdi]] and led a [[Mahdist War|jihad]] against the [[History of Sudan (1821-1885)|Khedive of Egypt's rule over the Sudan]] and the [[British Empire]]. 
* [[Chilembwe uprising]] - a 1915 uprising in [[Nyasaland]] led by a millenarian priest
* The Melanesian [[John Frum]] [[cargo cult]] believed in a return of their ancestors brought by Western technology.
* [[Burkhanism]] was an [[Altay people|Altay]]an movement led by a visionary that reacted against [[Russification]].
* The [[Battle of Kuruyuki]] was the 1892 attempt of the [[Eastern Bolivian Guarani]] to combat Christianity and Bolivian settlers.   
* The [[Guaycuru|Guaycuruan]]-speaking [[Toba people|Toba]] attempted to regain control of the [[Gran Chaco]] in Argentina in 1904.
* The [[Tepehuán Revolt]] in 1620s Mexico was an attempt to expel Spanish colonists and priests and return to traditional ways.

'''''Mirror's Edge''''' is a first-person [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Platform game|platform]] video game developed by [[EA DICE]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. The game was announced in July 2007, and was released for the [[Xbox 360]] and [[PlayStation 3]] in November 2008. A [[Microsoft Windows]] version was released on January 13, 2009. ''Mirror's Edge'' is powered by [[Unreal Engine 3]], with the addition of a new lighting solution, developed by [[Illuminate Labs]] in association with DICE.

''Mirror's Edge'' is set in a quasi-futuristic [[dystopia]]n society, in which a network of 'runners', including the main character, [[Faith Connors]], act as couriers to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional [[platform game]], the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, through ventilation shafts, and otherwise within urban environments, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by [[parkour]]. The game has a brightly colored, [[Minimalism|minimalist]] style and differs from most previous first-person perspective video games in allowing for a greater freedom of movement with regard to its 3D environment. This allows for a wider range of actions—such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges; in having no [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]]; and in allowing a range of vision which incorporated the legs, arms, and torso of the character as frequently visible elements on-screen.

''Mirror's Edge'' has received positive reviews, with the PC version garnering a [[Metacritic]] aggregated score of 81. The game's uniqueness and its expansive environments have received praise, while criticism has centred on its weakness of plot, trial and error gameplay, and short length. The game won the [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences#Annual Interactive Achievement Awards|Annual Interactive Achievement Award]] for Adventure Game of the Year. A [[Still Alive: The Remixes|soundtrack]] featuring remixes of the final credits song "Still Alive" by Swedish singer [[Lisa Miskovsky]] was also released. A [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scroller]] mobile game, also titled ''Mirror's Edge'', was released for [[iPad]] on April 1, 2010, and for the [[iPhone]] on September 2, 2010. The mobile game was ported to [[Windows Phone]] on July 13, 2012, with an initial exclusivity period for owners of [[Microsoft Lumia|Nokia Lumia]] phones. A prequel, ''[[Mirror's Edge Catalyst]]'', was officially announced at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013]] and released on June 7, 2016.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Mirrors-Edge-scr1.jpg|thumb|left|256px|alt=A uniformed soldier, standing on a rooftop, falls back after being kicked. Two arms and a leg belonging to the player's character are visible.|''Mirror's Edge'' features a realistic [[First person (video games)|first-person view]], with the character's limbs visible during [[hand-to-hand combat]].]]

In ''Mirror's Edge'', the player controls the protagonist, Faith, from a first-person perspective as she is challenged to navigate across a gleaming city by jumping between rooftops, running across walls, and gaining access to buildings through ventilation shafts. This is accomplished by use of techniques and movements inspired by the discipline of [[parkour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zZKRVkZvtA |title=Mirror's Edge interview by Gamereactor |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Video game producer|senior producer]] Owen O'Brien, ''Mirror's Edge'' aims to "convey [...] strain and physical contact with the environment", with the goal of allowing a freedom of movement previously unseen in the first-person genre.&lt;ref name="1Upprev1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Suttner |first=Nick |publisher=1UP.com |title=''Mirror's Edge'' Preview |url=http://www.1up.com/do/previewPage?cId=3166742 |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Edgemag"&gt;{{cite web|author=Edge staff |title=Leap of Faith: DICE's ''Mirror's Edge'' |work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |date=July 29, 2007 |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/features/leap-faith-dices-mirrors-edge |accessdate=February 4, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve this, camera movement pays more attention to character movement. For example, as Faith's speed builds up while running, the rate at which the camera bobs up and down increases as well. When a roll is executed, the camera spins with the character.&lt;ref name="ignprev"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ahearn |first=Nate |publisher=IGN |title= ''Mirror's Edge'' First Look – Xbox 360 Preview |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/855/855848p1.html |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=Mark |publisher=Kotaku |title=Experiencing Hyperreality, ''Mirror's Edge'' Impressions |url=http://kotaku.com/362114/experiencing-hyperreality-mirrors-edge-impressions |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith's arms, legs, and torso are prominent and their visibility is used to convey movement and momentum. The character's arms pump and the length of her steps increase with her gait, and her legs cycle and arms flail during long jumps.&lt;ref name="ignprev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Edge"&gt;{{cite web |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |publisher=Kotaku |title=''Mirror's Edge'' Sounds Pretty Great |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/kotaku-magu/mirrors-edge-sounds-pretty-great-281164.php |date=July 23, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070728155653/http://kotaku.com/gaming/kotaku-magu/mirrors-edge-sounds-pretty-great-281164.php |archivedate=July 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In gameplay, the character's [[momentum]] becomes an asset. The player must attempt to conserve it through fluidity of physical actions, encouraging the creation of chains of moves.&lt;ref name="runnervision"&gt;{{cite web |last=Pellett |first=Matthew |publisher=[[Computer and Video Games|CVG]] |title=Preview: ''Mirror's Edge''|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=188249 |date=May 4, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If Faith does not have the momentum required to traverse an object, she will fall off or short of it.&lt;ref name="euro"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bramwell |first=Tom |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |title=''Mirror's Edge'' Preview |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=93740 |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Controls are simplified by being context-sensitive; the "upwards movement" button will cause Faith to traverse an obstacle by passing over it (i.e., by jumping, vaulting, climbing, or grabbing set pieces like [[zip-line]]s) while the "downwards movement" button will cause her to perform other manoeuvres like sliding, rolling, or crouching.&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kuchera |first= Ben |publisher=Ars Technica|title= GDC: First peek at ''Mirror's Edge''; don't look down! |url=https://arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.ars/2008/02/29/notes-for-embargoed-mirrors-edge |date=February 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To assist the player in creating these chains of moves, the game employs a system called "Runner Vision", which emphasizes environmental pieces useful for progression. Certain pipes, ramps, and doors are highlighted in [[red]] as Faith approaches, allowing the player to instantly recognize paths and escape routes.&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt; Further along in the game, the number of these visual hints is reduced to only the end goal, and the player can opt to turn off this hint system entirely.&lt;ref name="runnervision"/&gt; It is also used to create puzzles in which the player must figure out how to combine the highlighted set pieces into a chain of moves in order to reach the target.&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt; Another means of assistance to the player is a system called "Reaction Time", a form of [[bullet time]] activated by the player, slowing down time and allowing the player to plan and time their next move without losing momentum or tactical advantage.&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt;

The player character can hold weapons, but O'Brien stressed that "this is an action adventure. We're not positioning this as a shooter – the focus isn't on the gun, it's on the person." Gameplay in ''Mirror's Edge'' focuses on finding the best route through the game's environments while combat takes a secondary role. Completing the game without shooting a single enemy unlocks an achievement for the player.&lt;ref name="1Upprev1"/&gt; Consequently, guns may be obtained by disarming an enemy, but when the magazine is empty, it will need to be discarded.&lt;ref name="runnervision"/&gt; Additionally, carrying a weapon slows Faith down; the heavier the gun, the more it hinders her movement. This introduces an element of strategy in determining when to trade agility for short-term firepower.&lt;ref name="1Upprev1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt;

Along with the campaign mode, ''Mirror's Edge'' features a [[time attack#Videogame|time attack]] mode, where the player must try to complete one of a set of special maps in the shortest amount of time. Best times can be uploaded to online leaderboards, where players can also download [[Glossary of video game terms#G|ghosts]] of other players to compete against.&lt;ref name=dicemappackrelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ea.com/news/downloadable-time-trial-map-pack-for-mirrors-edge|title=DICE Releases All-New Downloadable Time Trial Map Pack for ''Mirror's Edge''|date=February 19, 2009|publisher=EA|accessdate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=joystiqtt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/10/07/joystiq-hands-on-mirrors-edge-time-trial-mode/|last=Nelson|title=Joystiq hands-on: ''Mirror's Edge'' time trial mode|first=Randy|date=November 7, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2009|publisher=Joystiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maps are unlocked by playing through the campaign mode. According to producer Tom Ferrer, the time trial portions of ''Mirror's Edge'' are "bite-sized and short so you can grind them and play them and get faster and faster. It's not like playing an entire level."&lt;ref name="1up-trial"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3169616|publisher=1UP.com|title=''Mirror's Edge'' Features Time-Trial Mode|last=Kollar|first=Phillip|date=August 27, 2008|accessdate=October 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68DE98Q1W?url=http://www.1up.com/news/mirror-edge-features-time-trial-mode|archivedate=June 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mobile phone port includes many parkour moves from the PC and console versions, however, the perspective is shifted from first person to third person. The game does not feature cutscenes, and the plot is explained with scrolling text in between levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/games/mirrors-edge-2d-edition/iphone-54021|title=Mirror's Edge [2D Edition] (iPhone)|website=IGN|access-date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iOS version has since been removed from the app store due to problems with the game on iOS 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.ea.com/en/article/some-ea-games-are-being-removed-from-the-app-store/|title=Some EA games are being removed from the App Store|website=help.ea.com|access-date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Mirror's Edge'' takes place in a 'utopian' city&lt;ref name="sickness"&gt;{{cite web |last=Totilo |first=Stephen |publisher= MTV | title= EA Discusses ''Mirror's Edge'' Sickness Concerns, Lack Of Color Green |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/2456471/ea-discusses-mirrors-edge-sickness-concerns-lack-of-color-green/ | date= March 7, 2008 | accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where life is comfortable and crime almost non-existent. But the city's state of bliss is the achievement of a domineering and [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[Military dictatorship|military regime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.playstation.com/games-media/games/detail/item101965/Mirrors-Edge%E2%84%A2/|accessdate=February 16, 2010|publisher=uk.playstation.com|title=Playstation Games – ''Mirror's Edge''}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[Mass surveillance|monitors all communication]], controls the media, spies on its citizens and has policies which include the outright prohibition of [[smoking]] and [[alcohol]]. The City also operates [[show trial]]s and runs on a [[Totalitarian democracy|sham democracy]]. Eighteen years before the events of the game, they had opened fire on a protest against their rule, killing many civilians.

As the story begins the mayoral elections are near and a new candidate, Robert Pope, is challenging the incumbent Mayor Callaghan on a platform of [[deregulation]].

===Themes===
According to senior producer Owen O'Brien, "[Mirror's Edge] asks how much of your [[personal freedom]] are you willing to give up for a comfortable life. It's not one girl against this [[Police state|police-state]] dictatorship. It's more subtle than that."&lt;ref name="gamasutra08"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3684/living_on_the_edge_dices_owen_.php|title=Living On The Edge: DICE's Owen O'Brien Speaks|author=Christian Nutt|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American TV series ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'' and film spin-off ''[[Serenity (2005 film)|Serenity]]'' were cited by O'Brien as inspirations. "Our other theme is you can't force other people to live by your rules and your society, even if your society is better," he said. "In Serenity The Operative actually says, 'This is not an evil empire. We just don't understand why you don't want to be part of our happy club.' Obviously they take it too far, and that's kind of what happens in our game as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3684/living_on_the_edge_dices_owen_.php?page=4|title=Living On The Edge: DICE's Owen O'Brien Speaks|author=Christian Nutt|page=4|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|date=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Rhianna Pratchett has said that the game's story examined why citizens would accept a life in a society where their personal choices were very limited. It also looked at reasons people might have for attempting to live outside the system and what could result from this. The society portrayed in the game was somewhere between what [[George Orwell]] described as an 'anti-utopia' and a Nanny State.&lt;ref name="Mirror's_Edge_newsarama"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/1896-looking-at-the-mirror-s-edge-with-rhianna-pratchett.html|title=Looking at the Mirror's Edge with Rhianna Pratchett|last=Robison|first=Seth|publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=January 7, 2009|accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
Faith, after completing a delivery to fellow Runner Celeste, learns that her sister Kate may be in trouble at Pope's office. When she arrives, she finds Kate standing beside Pope's body, insisting she has been framed for murder and requesting Faith to discover the cause. Faith finds a piece of paper with the name "Icarus" on it in Pope's hand. Kate refuses to flee with Faith, saying it would only make her look guilty, and is arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mirror's Edge|developer=[[EA Digital Illusions CE]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=November 12, 2008|platform=[[PlayStation 3]]/[[Xbox 360]]/[[Microsoft Windows]]|version=|scene=|level=Chapter 1: Flight|quote='''Faith''': Kate? / '''Kate''': ''[turns to face her]'' What are you doing here? / '''Faith''': ''[regarding the body]'' What happened?

At the meeting, Ropeburn discovers Faith's presence and attacks her, but Faith gains the upper hand and throws him off the roof. As he is hanging above a long drop, she tries to interrogate Ropeburn, but before he can reveal anything he is killed by an unknown assassin.

Lacking other leads, Faith investigates the security firm that has begun aiding the police force in their crackdown of Runners. She finds they are behind "Project Icarus", a program designed to train their forces in [[parkour]] style to oppose the Runners, giving them the ability to chase down and eliminate the Runners. Faith follows the trail of Ropeburn's killer to a boat in port; after chasing the unknown person, Faith discovers the assassin is actually Celeste, who is colluding with Project Icarus to keep herself safe, and Celeste warns Faith to consider the same. The arrival of the police allows Celeste to escape.&lt;ref name="Mirror's Edge"/&gt;

With Kate convicted for Pope's murder, Merc plans a way for Faith to ambush the police convoy transporting her to prison, and Faith helps to free Kate. She gives Kate her comms unit that she and Merc use and tells her that he will guide her back to his hideout. When Faith returns to the hideout, she finds it in ruins, with Merc dying and Kate recaptured. In his dying words, Merc tells Faith that Kate is now at the Shard, which contains Mayor Callaghan's office and the servers that run the city's surveillance systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Mirror's Edge|developer=[[EA Digital Illusions CE]]|publisher=[[Electronic Arts]]|date=November 12, 2008|platform=[[PlayStation 3]]/[[Xbox 360]]/[[Microsoft Windows]]|version=|scene=Cinematic|level=|quote='''Merc''': Heard them mention…the Shard. / '''Faith''': The mayor's place?}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Miller's help, Faith is able to enter the Mayor's private offices, and destroys the servers that will unlock the rooftop security door. She gains access to the roof, but Miller was also ambushed while in the security room, abruptly cutting off communications, leaving Miller's status unknown. On the roof, she finds Kate held at gunpoint by Jacknife. Jacknife reveals that he too is part of Project Icarus, and has been part of the plan all along to lure the Runners out of hiding. When Jacknife tries to take Kate onto a waiting helicopter, Faith jumps on before it can leave, knocking Jacknife out of the helicopter to fall to his death but also damaging the helicopter in the process. Faith helps Kate to escape safely from the falling helicopter.&lt;ref name="Mirror's Edge"/&gt;

During the [[Closing credits|end credits]], the media reports that Faith's actions have only served to intensify Project Icarus, and Faith and Kate are still wanted for Pope's murder. However, with the surveillance infrastructure damaged, the population is cautioned to avoid using electronic means of communications until their "security" is restored, with the location of Faith and Kate remaining unknown.

==Development and release==
In 2007, DICE creative director Ben Cousins told GamesIndustry.biz that the studio was looking to create "something fresh and interesting", anticipating a need to diversify away from the successful ''[[Battlefield (video game series)|Battlefield]]'' franchise the studio was known for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Martin |first=Matt |title=DICE promises to diversify with new projects |publisher=GamesIndustry.biz |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/dice-promises-to-diversify-with-new-projects |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' magazine revealed that DICE was working on a game called ''Mirror's Edge'', which was expected to "shake up the [first-person shooter] genre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ogden |first=Gavin |publisher=Computer and Video Games |title=New DICE shooter revealed |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=166931 |date=June 29, 2007 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 10, 2007, ''Mirror's Edge'' was officially announced by [[Electronic Arts]], and at the [[Game Developers Conference]] in San Francisco in February 2008, the first demonstration of gameplay was shown.&lt;ref name="ars"/&gt; A video featuring entirely in-game footage was released at the Sony PlayStation Day in London on May 6, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fahey |first=Mike |publisher=Kotaku |title=''Mirror's Edge'' In Motion |url=http://kotaku.com/387711/mirrors-edge-in-motion |date=May 6, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Mirror's Edge'' has a distinct visual style, with the outdoor environments predominantly featuring [[white]] and distinctively lacking in [[green]] (for example, trees and foliage would appear completely white instead of in their natural colours), punctuated by deliberate use of strong [[primary color|primary colours]]. According to Senior Producer Owen O'Brien, the stylistic choice allows the player to focus on the Runner Vision guidance, as well as serving as a [[health (gaming)|health meter]]; the colours become less saturated as Faith starts to take damage.&lt;ref name=sickness/&gt; Because development of ''Mirror's Edge'' began before DICE's own [[Frostbite (game engine)|Frostbite]] was completed, the game uses [[Epic Games|Epic]]'s Unreal Engine 3. A [[Global illumination|lighting system]] called "[[Beast (lighting software)|Beast]]" was developed for the Unreal Engine by [[Illuminate Labs]] in association with DICE. The new software would accentuate the different art style of ''Mirror's Edge'', by allowing for the reflection of colours as well as light.&lt;ref name="unreal"&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller |first=Ross |title=''Mirror's Edge'' reflects on Unreal Engine 3 |publisher=Joystiq |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2008/05/07/mirrors-edge-reflects-on-unreal-engine-3 |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Illuminate Labs]] |title= ''Mirror's Edge'' | url=http://www.illuminatelabs.com/gallery/mirror-s-edge |accessdate= May 12, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916084446/http://www.illuminatelabs.com/gallery/mirror-s-edge |archivedate=September 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address the issue of [[Motion sickness#Simulation sickness|simulation sickness]] associated with the free movement of the camera in first-person view, a small [[reticle]] was placed in the centre of the screen.

On December 4, 2008, EA announced the creation of seven all-new time trial maps for ''Mirror's Edge'', slated for release in January 2009. According to Owen O'Brien, Senior Producer for DICE, “The freedom of movement and control in first person has been the most popular aspect of ''Mirror's Edge'' so we decided to distill these down to their purest form for this map pack...

A [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[browser game]] interpretation of ''Mirror's Edge'' titled ''Mirror's Edge 2D'' was released by Electronic Arts in conjunction with independent developer Borne Games.

'''Mucuchí''' (Mokochi) is a suspected [[Timotean languages|Timotean language]] of [[Venezuela]]. Mirripú (Maripú) was a dialect. Most classifications place them as dialects of Timote, with Cuica being a separate language, but the data in Loukotka indicates that Timote and Cuica were one language, and Mucuchí–Marripú another; this is reflected in Campbell &amp; Grondona (2012).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6171">'''Online credentials for learning''' are [[digital credential]]s that are offered in place of traditional paper [[credential]]s for a skill or educational achievement. They are directly linked to the accelerated development of internet communication technologies, the development of [[digital badge]]s, [[electronic passport]]s and [[massive open online course]]s (MOOCs).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Online credentials have their origin in the concept of [[open educational resources]] (OER), which was invented during the Forum on Open Courseware for Higher Education in Developing Countries held in 2002 at [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;Butcher, N. 2011. ''A Basic Guide to Open Educational Resources''. Vancouver, BC, Commonwealth of Learning, and Paris, UNESCO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next decade the OER concept gained significant traction, and this was confirmed by the World Open Educational Resources (OER) Congress organized by UNESCO in 2012. One of the outcomes of the congress was to encourage the open licensing of educational materials produced with public funds. [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons licensing]] provides the necessary standardization for copyright permissions, with a strong emphasis on the shift towards sharing and [[Open content|open licensing]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Test-based credentials ==
Test-based credentials have gained popularity both in the online market, and in programming and highly technical tasks. These credentials are earned by taking multiple-choice or project-based tests in various skill areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Online badges ==
Badges allow individuals to demonstrate job skills, educational accomplishments, online course completion or just about anything else that a badge creator decides. The concept is still quite flexible and undefined. Badges support capturing and translating learning across contexts; encouraging and motivating participation and learning outcomes; and formalizing and enhancing existing social aspects of [[Informal learning|informal]] and interest-driven learning.&lt;ref&gt;Mozilla Foundation and Peer 2 Peer University. 2012. Open badges for lifelong learning. Exploring an open badge ecosystem to support skill development and lifelong learning for real results such as jobs and advancement. Developed in collaboration with the MacArthur Foundation. Working document.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Europe, since 2000, the work of the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training|CEDEFOP]]&lt;ref&gt;Bjornavold, J. 2001. Making learning visible: identi cation, assessment and recognition of non-formal learning. ''European Journal of Vocational Training'', Vol. 22, pp. 24–32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;CEDEFOP. 2009. ''European Guidelines for Validating Non-Formal and Informal Learning''. Luxembourg, CEDEFOP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CEDEFOP. 2014. ''Use of Validation by Enterprises for Human Resources and Career Development Purposes''. Luxembourg, CEDEFOP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; and the adoption in 2009 of the European Guidelines for Validating Non-formal and Informal Learning&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; have supported the development of policies and programmes periodically monitored through the European inventory on validation of [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]] and informal learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Online or digital badges are not dissimilar to the concept of the [[Europass|Europass CV]]. With open badges the process is more decentralized and removed from the traditional quality assurance bodies:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mozilla website www.openbadges.org, accessed 19 April 2014.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A criticism of open badges, such as those developed by [[Mozilla]], is that they lack a credible quality assurance component. On the positive side, open badges are free and allow for the inclusion of various forms of learning, including non-formal and informal learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Online certificates ==
Among alternative credentials, online certificates currently command the highest value, and are nearly comparable to a traditional degree. Earning an online certificate from an [[online college]], a company or an industry-specific organization is typically much more involved than for the other credentials. The certificates are often connected to specific job functions. Many of these certificates have been created by companies such as [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], [[IBM]] or [[Microsoft]] to meet their own needs or the needs of their customers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Future developments ==
Future challenges for the concept that have been identified include the way issuing and earning process for the badges is quality-assured; the centralization (or not) of the badge-issuing process and the legitimacy of any organization that takes charge of it; the way badge issuers are using the open standard to ensure that the learners stay in control and badges remain interoperable; and the way badges will be used and recognized by education institutions, enterprises and individuals.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''Oxford Literary Review''''' is an [[academic journal]] of literary theory. The journal was founded in the late 1970s by Ian McLeod, Ann Wordsworth and [[Robert J. C. Young]], and publishes articles on the history and development of [[Deconstruction|deconstructive]] thinking in intellectual, cultural and political life. ''Oxford Literary Review'' has published new work by [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Jean-Luc Nancy]], and [[Hélène Cixous]], and continues to publish new work in the tradition and spirit of deconstruction.

The journal was originally published termly (i.e. three times a year), then bi-annually, though for some years it appeared as a "double issue" as an annual publication. The ''Oxford Literary Review'' is now published twice yearly by [[Edinburgh University Press]] in July and December. Special issues on specific themes alternate with general issues which include articles from varied intellectual disciplines on issues and writers belonging to or engaging with the work of deconstructive thinking (such as [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Emmanuel Levinas]], and [[Luce Irigaray]]).

The '''Prairie State Achievement Examination''' ('''PSAE''') was a two-day [[standardized test]] taken by all [[High school (North America)|High School]] [[Eleventh grade|Juniors]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]]. On the first day, students take the [[ACT (examination)|ACT]], and on the second day, a [[WorkKeys]] examination and [[Illinois State Board of Education]]-developed science examination.&lt;ref name=BOEmemo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbe.state.il.us/assessment/pdfs/psae_grad_guid_memo.pdf |title=Memorandum:2006-07 Guidance – Graduation and the Prairie State Achievement Examination |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |author=Becky McCabe, Division Administrator, Student Assessment Division |date=August 21, 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Illinois State Board of Education]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213040300/http://www.isbe.state.il.us/assessment/pdfs/psae_grad_guid_memo.pdf |archivedate=February 13, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is no longer administered in Illinois schools; however, it was required for all Illinois High School Students from 2001-2014.&lt;ref name=PSAEreport&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccsr.uchicago.edu/publications/psae_report.pdf |title=Understanding the Prairie State Achievement Exam |accessdate=April 20, 2007 |author=Stephen M.

The '''Regius Chair of Rhetoric and English Literature''' at the [[University of Edinburgh]] was established in 1762 (as the '''Regius Chair of Rhetoric and Belles Lettres'''). It is arguably the first professorship of English Literature established anywhere in the world. Its first holder was Professor [[Hugh Blair]]. Recent holders have included Professors Alistair Fowler, Ian Donaldson, [[John Frow]], and Laura Marcus. The Current holder is Greg Walker.

A '''satiric misspelling''' is an intentional misspelling of a word, phrase or name for a [[rhetoric]]al purpose. This is often done by replacing a letter with another letter (for example, ''[[k]]'' replacing ''[[c]]''), or symbol (for example, ''[[$]]'' replacing ''[[s]]'', ''[[@]]'' replacing ''[[a]]'', or ''[[¢]]'' replacing ''c'').  Satiric misspelling is found particularly in [[Internet slang|informal writing on the Internet]], but can also be found in some serious political writing that opposes the [[status quo]].
&lt;!-- NOTE TO EDITORS: Examples in this article should be cited in the style described at [[WP:CITE#HOW]] whenever possible, instead of simply providing an external link. --&gt;

== ''K'' replacing ''c'' ==
Replacing the letter ''c'' with ''k'' in the first letter of a word came into use by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] during its early years in the mid-to-late 19th century. The concept is continued today within the group.

[[File:Barc okupa.jpg|thumb|Barcelona squat and anarchist centre, labelled "OKUPA Y RESISTE"]]
In the 1960s and early 1970s in the [[United States]], [[left-wing politics|leftists]], particularly the [[Yippies]], sometimes used ''[[Amerika (disambiguation)|Amerika]]'' rather than ''America'' in referring to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15,69.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123223245/http://www.schwarzreport.org/Newsletters/1969/november15%2C69.htm |title=CACC NEWSLETTER |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |work=schwarzreport.org |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hippy.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=81|title=A Call to Arms (1969?) -  Hippy Land, Home of the Hippies|work=hippy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050726012713/http://riseup.net/sds/graphics.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine|archivedate=July 26, 2005 |work=riseup.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/sixties/radical.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.american.edu/bgriff/H207web/sixties/rubinchildofAmerika.htm|title=Jerry Rubin: Self-Portrait of a Child of "Amerika," 1970|work=american.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still used as a political statement today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jasonalexandercruz.com/|title=Nachrichten aus der Musik- und Entertainmentbranche -  Jasonalexandercruz.com|work=jasonalexandercruz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/guinnessgurl/sets/148438/|title=political|work=Flickr}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that this was originally an allusion to the [[German language|German]] spelling of the word, and intended to be suggestive of [[Nazism]], a hypothesis that the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' supports.

In broader usage, the replacement of the letter ''c'' with ''k'' denotes general political skepticism about the topic at hand and is intended to discredit or debase the term in which the replacement occurs.&lt;ref name="LeSaint's Sloth Cave"&gt;{{cite web|title=LeSaint's Sloth Cave|url=http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html|accessdate=29 May 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121925/http://www.le-saint.com/wear.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar usage in [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Catalan Language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]]{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} is to write ''okupa'' rather than ''ocupa'' (often on a building or area occupied by [[squatter]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp |title=comunidades.calle22.com - TODOS SOMOS OKUPAS |accessdate=2004-10-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611121504/http://comunidades.calle22.com/comunidades/397/com397con2.asp |archivedate=June 11, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the name adopted by ''okupación'' activist groups), which is particularly remarkable because the letter "k" is not part of the Spanish, Portuguese or Italian alphabets. It stems from a combination of English borrow words with k in them to those languages, and [[Anarchism in Spain|Spanish anarchist]] and [[Punk rock|punk]] movements which used "k" to signal rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodríguez González|first=Félix|year=2006|title=Medios de comunicación y contracultura juvenil|work=Círculo|volume=25:5–30|url=http://www.ucm.es/info/circulo/no25/rodriguez.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replacing "c" with "k" was at the centre of a [[Monty Python]] joke from the Travel Agent sketch. [[Eric Idle]] has an affliction that makes him pronounce the letter C as a B, as in "bolour" instead of "colour."  [[Michael Palin]] asks him if he can say the letter K?  Idle replies that he can, and Palin suggests that he spell words with a K instead of C.  Idle replies, "what, spell bolour with a K?  Kolour.  Oh!  I never thought of that before!  What a silly [[Cunt#Comedy|bunt]]!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript|url=http://web.mit.edu/humor/Special/Monty.Python/travel.agency|work=Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Index of Humor|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game franchise [[Mortal Kombat]] is another example of this trend.

===''KKK'' replacing ''c'' or ''k''===
A common satiric usage of the letters ''KKK'' is the spelling of ''America'' as ''Amerikkka'', alluding to the [[Ku Klux Klan]], drawing to a perceived notion of an underlying or inherent [[Racism in the United States|racism]] in American society. The earliest known usage of ''Amerikkka'' recorded in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is in 1970, in a journal called ''Black World''. Presumably, this was an extrapolation from the then already widespread ''Amerika''.{{Clarify|date=December 2014}}{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The spelling ''Amerikkka'' came into greater use after the 1990 release of the [[gangsta rap]] album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted]]'' by [[Ice Cube]], also used by rapper [[Spice 1]] for his album ''[[AmeriKKKa's Nightmare]]'' and by [[shock rock]] band [[Undercover Slut]] for their album ''Amerikkka Macht Frei''.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The letters ''KKK'' have been inserted into several other words and names, to indicate similar perceived racism, oppression or corruption. Examples include:
* ''Republikkkan'' ([[Republican Party (United States)|U.S. Republican Party]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstripe.com/archives/views/abanks/shrub.html |title=The Blackstripe - Stolen 2000 Election |accessdate=2004-10-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060225154916/http://www.blackstripe.com/archives/views/abanks/shrub.html |archivedate=February 25, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== @ replacing A, at or O&lt;span id="@replacing"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- linked from "At sign" --&gt;==
Since at least 1980, people have used the "at sign" ("[[@]]") as a representation of the [[Anarchy a|circled letter A]]. This has been extended to substituting it for the letter "A" as in the [[Crass]] [[fanzine]] ''Toxic Gr@fity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206073619/http://www.southern.com/southern/label/CRC/1980.html|archivedate=December 6, 2010|deadurl=yes|title=Crass Discography}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spanish, it became informally common (but not accepted by the [[Real Academia Espanola|RAE]], due to @ being a symbol and not a letter) to use @ in place of "o/a" to denote both genders.  For example, "señorit@" can be used to mean "señorita and/or señorito" instead of using "señorita/o."

==Word-in-word==
Occasionally a word written in its orthodox spelling is altered with internal capital letters, hyphens, italics, or other devices so as to highlight a fortuitous pun. Some examples:
* After the controversial [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. Presidential elections]], the alleged improprieties of the election prompted the use of such titles as "pResident" and "(p)resident"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060530225708/http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20010326&amp;s=contest |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 30, 2006 |title=Name the President! |date=March 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=May 14, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013030443/http://www.gainesvillehumanists.org/alerts.htm |archivedate=October 13, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[George W. Bush]]. The same effects were also used for [[Bill Clinton]] during and after Clinton's impeachment hearings. These devices were intended to suggest that the president was merely the ''resident'' of the [[White House]] rather than the legitimate leader.
* Similarly, the controversial [[United States]] law, the ''[[USA PATRIOT Act]]'', is sometimes called the "patRiot Act", "(pat)Riot Act", "PAT Riot Act", "PAT RIOT Act", or "You Sap At Riot Act"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stallman.org/pat-riot-act.html |title=PAT RIOT Act - Richard Stallman |publisher=Stallman.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=115660&amp;cid=9794643 |title=Slashdot Comments &amp;#124; British Columbia Acts Against Patriot Act |publisher=Yro.slashdot.org |date=July 25, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by its opponents.
* Feminist theologian [[Mary Daly]] has used a [[slash (punctuation)|slash]] to make a point about [[patriarchy]]: "gyn/ecology", "stag/nation", "the/rapist".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/17feature.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128070855/http://www.salon.com/it/feature/1999/03/17feature.html |date=January 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In French, where ''con'' is an insulting word meaning "moron", the word ''conservateur'' (conservative) has been written "con-servateur",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://membres.lycos.fr/prince2/Elections/J30.HTM |title=Elections Québec '98 |date=June 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611134857/http://membres.lycos.fr/prince2/Elections/J30.HTM |archivedate=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "con… servateur",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chantiers.org/cri.htm |title=cri |publisher=Chantiers.org |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "con(servateur)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france-mail-forum.de/fmf31/pol/31ruscio.htm |title=France-Mail-Forum Nr. 31: Politique et histoire |date=June 11, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611123723/http://www.france-mail-forum.de/fmf31/pol/31ruscio.htm |archivedate=June 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American English term ''neo-con'', an abbreviation of ''[[Neoconservatism|neo-conservative]]'', becomes a convenient pun when used in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=893321 |title=Les deux vies de " Wolfie ", le " néo-con " au " coeur qui saigne |publisher=LeMonde.fr |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In English, the first syllable of ''con''servative can be emphasized to suggest a [[Confidence trick|con artist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jane Kleeb |url=http://www.boldnebraska.org/con-servative-bait-and-switch |title="Con"servative Bait and Switch |publisher=Boldnebraska.org |date=July 2, 2010 |accessdate=2012-04-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402114344/http://www.boldnebraska.org/con-servative-bait-and-switch |archivedate=April 2, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The British political satire magazine ''[[Private Eye]]'' has a long-standing theme of insulting the law firm [[Carter-Ruck]] by replacing the R with an F to read Carter-Fuck. The law firm once requested that Private Eye cease spelling its name like that; the magazine then started spelling it "Farter-Fuck".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1450022/Peter-Carter-Ruck.html|title=Peter Carter-Ruck|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=22 December 2003|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, ''Private Eye'' often refers to ''[[The Guardian]]'' as ''[[The Grauniad]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/dec/16/society|title=Surely shome mishtake?|work=The Guardian|date=16 December 2000| location=London|last=Sherrin|first=Ned|authorlink=Ned Sherrin}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the newspaper's early reputation for [[typographical errors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_oO5fWi6dikC&amp;pg=PA26 |pages=26–27 |title=Porcupine, Picayune, &amp; Post: how newspapers get their names |first=Jim|last=Bernhard|publisher=University of Missouri Press|year=2007|isbn=0-8262-1748-6|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Netizens often called [[Bong Revilla|Sen. Ramon "Bong" Revilla Jr.]] as "''MandaramBONG''" (Filipino word for [[plunder]]er) to highlight allegations that he pocketed pork barrel funds through the use of fake non-government organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/01/20/14/mandarambong-netizens-twit-revilla-speech |title='MandaramBong': Netizens twit Revilla speech |work=ABS-CBN News |date=2014-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other significant respellings ==
{{See also|Misnomer}}

Along the same lines, intentional misspellings can be used to promote a specific negative attribute, real or perceived, of a product or service. This is especially effective if the misspelling is done by replacing part of the word with another that has identical phonetic qualities.

Some [[toponyms|place names]] are also spelled differently in order to emphasize some political view. For instance, ''Brasil'' (the Portuguese spelling of "Brazil"), is sometimes misconstrued as a typo for ''Brazil'' in English texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190200/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/brasil |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the English spelling ''Brazil'' is used in Portuguese pieces of text as a way to denote [[anti-Americanism]] or [[Anti-globalization|anti-globalization sentiment]].

Journalists may make a politicized editorial decision by choosing to differentially retain (or even create) misspellings, mispronunciations, ungrammaticisms, dialect variants, or interjections.

===Backronyms===
{{Main|Backronym}}
Plays on [[acronym]]s and [[initialism]]s are also common, when the full name is spelled out but one of the component words is replaced by another. For example, [[Richard Stallman]] and other [[Free Software Foundation]] executives often refer to [[digital rights management]]  as "digital '''restrictions''' management",&lt;ref&gt;[[Digital rights management#Opposition to DRM]]&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the tendency for DRM to stifle the end user's ability to reshare music or write CDs more than a certain number of times. Likewise, the [[National Security Agency]] is often referred to as the "National '''Surveillance''' Agency"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/2615652243001/national-surveillance-agency-audit-reveals-nsa-violations|title=National 'Surveillance' Agency?

'''''Scoundrel Days''''' is a memoir by [[List of Australian poets|Australian contemporary poet]] [[Brentley Frazer]]. Described as "''a gritty, Gen X memoir, recounting wild escapades into an under-culture of drugs and violence and sex'' by ABC Radio National &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/archived/booksandarts/brentley-frazers-scoundrel-days/8397844|title=Brentley Frazer's Scoundrel Days|last=|first=|date=|work=ABC: Radio National Books &amp; Arts|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=2017-04-10|dead-url=|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the publisher as "''Tom Sawyer on acid, a 21st-century On the Road, a Holden Caulfield for punks"'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.penguin.com.au/books/scoundrel-days-a-memoir-9780702259562|title=Penguin Books|last=|first=|date=2017-03-01|website=Penguin Books Australia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; literary critic [[Rohan Wilson]] compared Frazer's ability to shock, surprise and unsettle with that of [[Marcel Duchamp]], concluding: "''Frazer is writing here in the tradition of [[Helen Garner]], [[Andrew McGahan]] and [[Nick Earls]]''.''This is dirty realism at its dirtiest'' &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/review/brentley-frazers-memoir-gorges-on-excess-of-sex-drugs-and-violence/news-story/bbff23bedbd92a149e671bc93612379d|title=Brentley Frazer’s memoir gorges on excess of sex, drugs and violence|last=Wilson|first=Rohan|date=2017-03-10|work=The Australian|access-date=2018-03-12|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;".

== Writing and Publication ==
''Scoundrel Days'' was first published in Australia in March 2017 by [[University of Queensland Press]] in [[Trade-paperback|trade paperback]] format. Frazer wrote ''Scoundrel Days'' as the creative component of a Doctoral thesis&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://newtownreviewofbooks.com.au/2017/03/02/brentley-frazer-scoundrel-days-memoir-reviewed-annette-hughes/|title=BRENTLEY FRAZER Scoundrel Days: A memoir.

In an academic paper published by [http://www.textjournal.com.au/april16/frazer.htm ''TEXT Journal''] describing the writing process of ''Scoundrel Days'', Frazer refers to the work as a '''novelised memoir, written in first person present perfect . . . there is no [[The Wonder Years|Wonder Years]] voiceover telling you what to think''.'&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.textjournal.com.au/april16/frazer.htm|title=Beyond IS…Creative writing with English Prime|last=|first=|date=2016-04-01|website=Text Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-01|edition=Vol 20 No 1 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During an interview on Radio National ''[http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/nightlife/nightlife/8282280 ABC Nightlife]'' Frazer recounted that he first began to write ''Scoundrel Days'' in 1993 while living between share-houses in Fortitude Valley: '''The very first draft was disorder manifest, simply typed up transcriptions from journals written while itinerant, hitch-hiking or on long distance trains and buses between Townsville and Brisbane from the mid 80s. I abandoned several drafts, lost several in floods and evictions, working on it sometimes for a year and sometimes not wanting to look at it at all for months, all the while I kept doing stupid things to get more material to write about. The final draft came together when I decided to get very serious about learning how to write a novel and successfully pitched the work in progress to undertake a PhD in creative writing . . . I wrote the final sentence and felt comfortable thinking of it as finished and ready to submit to publishers in 2015, so, yeah, it took more than twenty years to write''.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/nightlife/nightlife/8282280|title=Nightlife: featuring Brentley Frazer|last=MacDonald|first=Sarah|date=2017-02-24|work=ABC Nightlife|access-date=2017-03-18|archive-url=http://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/nightlife/nightlife/8282280|archive-date=2017-03-18|dead-url=|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|orig-year=Broadcast: Fri 24 Feb 2017, 10:00pm NOTE: 28/03/18 Audio has expired}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

== Synopsis ==
The underlying narrative arc is of rejection and redemption, of anarchy and order, hate and love.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The story follows a recalcitrant boy who finds the sacred bond of familial trust broken by parents who, since their own birth, are members of [[Two by Twos|a secretive fundamentalist evangelical Christian cult]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Identity of cult revealed during radio interview with Sarah Macdonald&lt;/ref&gt; Exacerbating this Amish like environment is his father's job as a police officer and his dad has an ever-watchful eye on those who transcend both God and Man's rules and regulations. The first part of the book deals with the hyperbolic bravado the author adopts to counter his social standing as weirdo and cop's son in an outback mining town in far north Queensland. He starts a gang and adopts an outlook that one critic has described as 'anti coming of age'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2168934516?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1|title=Heffy's Reviews &gt; Scoundrel Days: A Memoir|last=|first=|date=2017-10-30|website=Goodreads|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; […] in this type of story the protagonist is far less mutable than they have any right to be. Instead, he is stubbornly sure of himself and resistant to change. Rather than stumble with trepidation through his teenage years he bypasses puberty and charges into adult situations with an unwarranted confidence.

After the family relocate to Townsville in 1984 he encounters extreme bullying at high school and soon befriends a dangerous and violent punk named Reuben, also new to town, who grew up on the streets of Sydney. After Reuben almost murders a bully in the schoolyard during one of numerous fights and our protagonist narrowly escapes a predatory pederast preacher visiting the family home, the two boys flee and go on a series of breath-taking adventures, soaked in smut and crime, walking on the very edge of life and death, up and down the east coast of Australia. The exploits and the break-neck pace of the narrative do not let up &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; until the late 1990s when redemption comes and the protagonist finds love with a young woman who checkmates his immorality and self-destructive tendencies.

== Style, Technique &amp; Genre ==
Written in a [[Transgressive fiction|transgressive]] [[Minimalism|minimalist]] style and leaning heavily on techniques developed by [[Tom Spanbauer]]'s theories of [[Dangerous Writing]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; ''Scoundrel Days'' has been described as reading with: ''a visceral and urgent internal perspective which is both direct and poetic, often charming, and sometimes bleakly funny,'' &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; ''gritty with a lyrical cadence,'' &lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; ''a nervy present-perfect tense reminiscent of the hyperbolic, ugly-beautiful prose of Kathy Acker,'' &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  a terse telegraphic prose that brings the reader very close to the details laid down thick and terrible,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://classic.4zzz.org.au/reviews/books/scoundrel-days|title=A Boy's Manifesto for Brutal Disrespect of Self|date=2017-02-22|work=4ZZZ Brisbane 102.1FM|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as ''an immersive, vital prose that almost drags the reader along.'' &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

''Scoundrel Days'' is marketed as a memoir, but does not use the reflective voice common to the genre, and therefore reads like a novel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; It is [[Bildungsroman]] in that it examines the author's formative years and also explicitly his spiritual education.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is [[Künstlerroman]] in the tradition of [[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]], [[Look Homeward, Angel]] and [[Ham on Rye]], as from the outset the reader witnesses the emergence of the poet from the [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|psychosocial]] chrysalis of childhood,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; and it is an autobiographical [[Roman à clef]] novel like those of [[Henry Miller]] and [[Jack Kerouac]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; All the fictitious names of the characters portray real people, all the events represent real events in the author's life but the ever-present drugs and alcohol lend an hallucinatory quality, which challenges the readers ability to trust the author's recall.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; It is this effective use of the [[unreliable narrator]] that has led both the publisher and the critics to compare the protagonist of ''Scoundrel Days'' with [[Tom Sawyer]], [[On the Road|Sal Paradise]] and [[Holden Caulfield]].

Frazer composed ''Scoundrel Days'' using an obscure literary constraint.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; According to Frazer's Doctoral thesis,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/371134|title=Scoundrel Days Writing Rebellion/Youthful Memoir|last=Frazer|first=Brentley|date=2017-12-28|website=Griffith University Research Repository|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first long-form creative work in history composed entirely in [[E-Prime|English Prime]], a language discipline in which there are no tenses of the verb “to be”. By using this technique and abandoning the copula (are, am, is, was, were, be, etc.,), it's misuse which results in Deity mode of speech (Bourland Jr &amp; Kellogg III, 1990&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;), the literary voice of the narrator becomes what Frazer refers to as, ''Human Mode of Speech'',&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; the problem of show vs tell fades to insignificance as the narrative moves from ''the showing to the doing''.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The result is a narrative that one critic wrote 'should become the gold-standard how-to manual on writing clear, utterly active prose.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;'

The author himself, talking about the writing of ''Scoundrel Days'' during an interview on ''Radio National'', Canberra (Books and Arts)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; hosted by Michael Cathcart and Cassie McCullagh, says he is influenced by Henry Miller, but does not like the misogyny, sexual violence and overuse of gendered nouns present in Miller's work. Frazer says he made sure that those things never happened in his writing, and says he did not want to give the readers a shocking, judgemental explicitness. Frazer denies there is any misogyny in the writing of his experiences, and says he is a passive partner. McCullagh says she was around in the time when the book was based, and asks about the genuine sexual nature of the women around the 1980s and 1990s. Frazer says the females in the smaller country towns were bored and very adventurous, and says they were experimenting sexually earlier on, as were the boys. He talks about the human drive to have freedom, and his way of life during the time of the memoir. He says he put new techniques borrowed from the world of filmmaking in his book for the more astute readers, and says he only sees the central figure as a slightly magnified character. McCullagh asks Frazer about the time when the memoir was based, and asks him to describe the narrative arc of the time frame. Frazer discusses the contents of the book, the situations he put himself into to create an exciting narrative, and the influence of the character Tom Sawyer written by Mark Twain's had on his own life. He says he stopped pushing the boundaries when he fell in love, and said his lifestyle as a sort-of teenaged [[Vicomte de Valmont|Valmont]] had given him enough lived experience to write the memoir.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Themes ==
Focusing mainly on the lifestyle and proclivities of bohemian artists, writers and poets in Australia in the 80s and 90s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/brisbanenews/docs/1120/5|title=Brisbane News magazine, March 22-28, 2017. www.brisbanenews.com.au|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; the book largely functions as a meditation on the pursuit of total artistic and personal freedom and embodies the philosophy of Oscar Wilde's tenet [[Oscar Wilde|Life imitates Art]]; the living and the writing are one and the same, indistinguishable to the protagonist. Transgressive tropes abound: promiscuity, group sex, drugs, institutionalised violence, anti-socialism, nihilism, immorality, perversion and crime are the main focus &lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; and the young poet, disillusioned with his parents and the foundational morality of their religious cult, rejects the corruption he perceives in society by getting out of control. He becomes a problem. Precocious, brash, and certain of his own perceptions, he reads poetry and despises any attempt to socialise him into a system he has no intention of joining.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Scoundrel Days'' pays homage to lost boys who grow up to be troubled young men. Frazer's childhood in [[Greenvale, Queensland|Greenvale]], 220 kilometres northwest of Townsville, is populated by budding pugilists, often themselves the victims of casual violence or sexual abuse. More than once there looms a drunken father as awful as Pap in ''The Adventures of Tom Sawyer''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Growing up godless in a "deranged, apocalyptic" cult, Frazer develops a disdain for authority, cemented by his run-ins with the ne'er-do-wells in his policeman father's cells, and also the "tramp preachers" who pass through town and who have a tendency to wander into the bathroom as he showers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/memoir-review-scoundrel-days-20170315-guykzo.html|title=Scoundrel Days review: Boy's own tale of the fast and furious|last=|first=|date=2017-03-15|website=smh.com.au|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already inured to pain and violence through living next door to the lock-up where his father works as the local cop, Brentley arrives at school and his world expands, as does his capacity for observation and recall. Brentley, the outsider – the weird kid – takes all the punches in the gut from the outset and consequently becomes wary, vigilant and extremely self-conscious. He watches himself act, and soon learns how to put on other personas and slip into characters from the books he reads. ''Scoundrel Days'' examines the concepts of conscience and morality and how we form them. Do we acquire the inner voice? Or does it emerge from within, inherent, like the colour of one’s eyes? This memoir throws up questions about the nature of conscience, which propels much of young Brentley’s character development.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Under it all lies a dark, nihilist void where, like Gordon in Andrew McGahan’s Praise (1992), expectation is seen as the root of unhappiness. But unlike Gordon, who slouches towards destruction content in the acceptance of a flawed physicality, Frazer oscillates between bravado and moments of self-awareness. This enigmatic, self-styled outsider bravely lets us into the inner sanctum, which makes for a fascinating read.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australianbookreview.com.au/abr-online/current-issue/march/3926-duncan-fardon-reviews-scoundrel-days-a-memoir-by-brentley-frazer|title=ABR Reviews Scoundrel Days|last=|first=|date=2017-03-01|website=australianbookreview.com.au|url-access=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characters ==
The true identity of the characters portrayed in ''Scoundrel Days'' have not been revealed by the author.

An elder indigenous Australian who is a Kuradji (similar to a shaman) and opens the young protagonist's eyes to the injustices of the European invader.

=== Hardy ===

A boy also born into the cult&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; but is a secret member of a locally notorious graffiti posse ''The Heartbreak Kids'' and serves as the protagonist's link to:

=== Gigolo ===

A ward of the state half Australian Aboriginal street artist and leader of graffiti posse The Heartbreak Kids. Described as resembling the pop star Prince and an expert at breakdancing and break and entering.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Muddy ===

A half Australian Aboriginal bully and the schoolyard nemesis of the protagonist. Described as an anorexic leather jacket dragged through broken windscreens and thorny interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

'''Reuben'''

The antihero of the book. A maladjusted, sociopathic and violent street kid who was the leader of a Sydney razor gang, described as both resembling spaghetti western heartthrob [[Terence Hill]] and as a deadly [[Rudolf Nureyev|Nureyev]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Candy ===

A beautiful bisexual junky who is a student of fashion design and a nude artist's model. The protagonist meets her in a nightclub and the pair becomes inseparable for about seven years in the timeline of the narrative.

=== Josef ===

An expat New Zealand musician who the protagonist meets at a model agency in Melbourne. Josef moves in with Brentley to start a punk band, much to the disdain of Candy. Josef spends several years on and off share housing with the couple between Melbourne, Brisbane and Townsville. Described as a thin hipped bass-playing kiwi bastard.

=== Yuri ===

A neo-beat poet from Brisbane who Brentley meets at a poetry reading in 1994. Yuri moves into an apartment shared by Brentley, Candy and Candy's sister Marie, an artist with the proclivity of painting in the nude and instigating group sex with the two poets whenever her sister is absent.

Frazer was immediately compared with [[Jack Kerouac|Kerouac]], [[J. D.

Notwithstanding that, the level of detail speaks to authentic recall rather than confabulation. But this writer’s mind runs on no ordinary tracks.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

''The Saturday Paper'' argued that the writing of the beat generation has been a toxic influence on the literature of male writers in the late 20th and early 21st centuries and the days of readers wishing to revel in aggressively masculine, hedonistic worlds of hard drinking, drug-taking and sexual conquest are long gone.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Literary critic Pam Greet wrote: Fuelled by drugs, alcohol, thousands of cigarettes, and punctuated by sex, violence, and wanton acts of both public and private (self-) destruction, Brentley Frazer’s memoir does not scream ‘poet in the making’.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

''The Australian'' singled out the sexual escapades of the author for criticism, writing this is what seems to get author in the most trouble, ''predatory religious figures, horny American backpackers, or desperately lonely long-distance lovers, our hero is never more than a few steps away from some new entanglement [...]'' They shed little light on who Brentley was at these points in his life, and [as] the women come and go and we learn barely more about them than what they look like. ''The question of misogyny starts to peek out of the text'' but any sense that it might be dealt with is forestalled until later on.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Pam Greet also criticised Frazer's female characters, writing: Other writers describe Scoundrel Days as demonic, compelling, transcendent, sublime, radical. For me, scary. Frazer’s females I found especially difficult. Three basic groups include sisters and family relatives (thinly rendered: ‘I said to my mother once during an argument that I’ll never forgive her for getting me circumcised, that my recalcitrant attitude results from her karma.’), teachers and deputy principals (condemned by position) and girlfriends/sex objects (sex seemingly one of the only things that mattered: girlfriends, their sisters, their mothers, their friends, twosomes, threesomes, whatever).&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

The ''Newtown Review of Books'' questioned the precociousness of the protagonist, questioning: how does the young teen find the fortitude to reject his family’s religious beliefs? How does he decide to act and expose a predatory preacher at such a tender age, when no one else will? How can he be so attached to a violent punk like Reuben, whom he loves like a brother? How could he have sex with his girlfriend’s sisters, able to blithely ‘slaunt’ from one risky sexual encounter to the next, then somehow develop into an adult capable of deep empathy?&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Brisbane radio station 4ZZZ referred to ''Scoundrel Days'' as ''A Boy's Manifesto for Brutal Disrespect of Self'' &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.4zzzfm.org.au/reviews/books/scoundrel-days|title=Scoundrel Days: A Boy's Manifesto for Brutal Disrespect of Self|last=|first=|date=2017-04-14|work=4ZZZ FM Radio|access-date=2017-05-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and heavily criticised the author's laissez-faire and bohemian attitude to excessive smoking, drinking, drugs, violence and promiscuity; arguing that it is irresponsible of the publisher to market such a book to troubled young men and inappropriate for the author to encourage seeking value in vice. ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' makes a subtle reference to the books inherent promiscuity, dangerous living, drug taking and possible hyperbole, writing that "''Frazer scatters memories like used tissues in share houses across Brisbane, Townsville, Airlie Beach, Melbourne and Perth. He subsists on pot noodles and weed, fuelled by Kerouac, Byron, Burroughs and Russian revolutionaries. Money, he reckons, is "coloured paper printed by some swindler [...] Sometimes the yarns stretch into tales taller than Mount Surprise, but then Scoundrel Days is more autobiographical fiction than memoir''.".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Newtown Review of Books commented ''Scoundrel Days'' contains enough meat for half a dozen creative writing theses, but ''violence emerges as the major theme'' [...] teens who railed against stultifying suburban hells of the late 20th century and came of age in share houses, surviving on shit jobs and the dole, will recall ''the taste of amphetamine and cheap booze and the smell of mouldy sheets on a stained mattress''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Brag also made point of noting ''the tender age'' at which the protagonist learns the meanings of the words suicide, rape, jacking off, growling out, and a number of common swears [...] and while part of a rebellious schoolyard gang called The Wreckers, he discovers tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, amphetamines, pornography, madness, family violence and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.troublemag.com/social-work-brentley-frazer/|title=Social Work: Brentley Frazer|last=|first=|date=2017-05-01|website=Trouble Magazine|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the subject matter, other criticisms included the perception that Frazer did not include enough about the fundamentalist Christian cult which featured heavily in promotional material for the book. The Saturday Paper wrote: "The shame is that Frazer’s childhood in [[Two by Twos|The Truth]] is so teasingly dismissed, as he chooses instead to chronicle the most boring decade of a young literary hoon’s life, aping, for the umpteenth time, the tired old conventions of a movement whose toxic influence still lingers." &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Individual Reviewers ===
On ''Scoundrel Days'' the following notable Australian writers have commented:

"'How brilliant is the writing in Scoundrel Days? Like poetry written with a nail gun. Shit he's good. Uncommonly good. He's got a great eye, but also a lot of muscle to his writing, and that combo doesn't come along often enough. I hope he's got a lot more prose in him." ~ [[Nick Earls]]&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

"With a poet's eye for locating the marvellous within the commonplace and a novelist's ear for the nuances and rhythms of natural speech, Brentley Frazer has crafted a unique narrative from the myths and rumours of life and a wild imagination. Scoundrel Days is fiercely original, inspirational, and will no doubt find a wide, varied readership.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;" ~ [[Anthony Lawrence (poet)|Anthony Lawrence]]

"An artist's true journey from blindness (or, what we call youth) into glimmerings of sight (coming of age). The writing is wonderful, and the writer lives in the tradition of the Beats, yet has managed to create something new through his use of the E-prime constraint.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;" ~ Dr [[Venero Armanno]], (''Black Mountain'' and ''The Dirty Beat'')

"A unique new voice in the Australian literary landscape.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;" ~ [[Lindsay Simpson]] (''Brothers in Arms'' and ''The Curer of Souls'')

In an opinion piece in ''The Australian'', the critic writes: "as far as anyone knows, this is the first time anyone has attempted a full-length memoir without the copula. Friends have asked me: “OK, that sounds cute, but is it any good?” Which is a question forbidden under the rules. But yes. It is." ~ [[Caroline Overington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/opinion/columnists/brentley-frazers-outlet-for-recollections-of-cult-worship-and-a-yowie-encounter/news-story/5d902918e147183ef35ac853b9f24abf|title=Brentley Frazer’s outlet for recollections of cult worship and a yowie encounter|last=Overington|first=Caroline|date=2017-05-03|work=The Australian|access-date=2018-03-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenny Valentish for [[Fairfax Media]] writes: ''Frazer is a legendary protagonist, in the vein of Bukowski’s literary alter-ego [...] His writing is sometimes compared to that of Andrew McGahan, in particular, McGahan’s coming-of-age novel Praise, but Scoundrel Days spends little time examining the consistency of its author’s bodily fluids. Instead, he uses that nervy present-perfect tense to take us further, faster, harder. It has more in common with the hyperbolic, ugly-beautiful prose of Kathy Acker.”'' &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

“Poet and author Brentley Frazer recounts his rebellious youth with searing honesty in his memoir Scoundrel Days. Gritty with a lyrical cadence, the characters and violent, drug-fuelled, sexually-charged experiences he recounts are compelling for their raw detail and darkness. Frazer’s innate attraction to dissent, his untamed spirit and how it shaped his young life will sometimes shock, but makes reading his words an addiction in itself.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;” ~ [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue Magazine]], Australia

''“''Scoundrel Days is the compelling memoir from poet Brentley Frazer about his misspent adolescence in Queensland, a roller-coaster ride of wild excess and anti-authoritarian adventures told in urgent and beautiful prose.” —Sunday Life Magazine, READ, Sun Herald and [[Sunday Age]]

'''Semigallian''', or '''Zemgalian''', is an [[extinct language]] of the [[Baltic language]] sub-family of the [[Indo-European languages]].

== History ==
It was spoken in the northern part of [[Lithuania]] and southern regions of [[Latvia]] in what is known as [[Semigallia]]. It is thought that it was extinct by the 16th century, with the assimilation by the [[Latvians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631220398_chunk_g978063122039831_ss1-2|title=Zemgalian : Encyclopedia of the Languages of Europe : Blackwell Reference Online|website=www.blackwellreference.com|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Semigallian is known only from references to it in documents and texts from before the 16th century.

== Phonology ==
Semigallian shares some phonological similarities to [[Curonian language|Curonian]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Latvian language|Latvian]]. The Common Baltic {{IPA|/k/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ/}} consonants became {{IPA|/c/}}, {{IPA|/d͡z/}} in their soft varieties in Semigalian. All long vowels and diphthongs at the end of the word in Common Baltic were reduced to simple short vowels in Semigallian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tied.verbix.com/tree/balt/semigalian.html|title=Semigalian language|last=Babaev|first=Cyril|website=tied.verbix.com|access-date=2017-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Akvaduktot.jpg|thumb|Historical images of Skopje: Аqueduct.]]
The '''Skopje Aqueduct''' ({{lang-mk|Скопски аквадукт}}) is an [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] and archaeological site located in the village of [[Vizbegovo]] {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} northwest of central [[Skopje]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. The Skopje Aqueduct is the only [[aqueduct (bridge)|aqueduct]] in Macedonia, and one of three largest and well preserved in the former [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] along with [[Diocletianus Aqueduct]] near [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Croatia]] and [[Bar Aqueduct]] in [[Montenegro]].

The question of when the Skopje Aqueduct was built is unclear. There are three theories:
*during the reign of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] (1st century); according to this theory the aqueduct fed water to [[Legionary]] settlement [[Scupi]].
*during the reign of [[Byzantine Empire]] (reign of Emperor [[Justinian I]]); according to this theory, the aqueduct shipped water to the new settlement [[Justiniana Prima]].&lt;ref&gt;According to this theory, Justiniana Prima, was somewhere near the [[Skopje Fortress]], and not, as is usually considered in [[Lebane]] [[Serbia]], at the site [[Justiniana Prima|Caričin Grad]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*during the reign of [[Ottoman Empire]]; according to this theory the aqueduct was built in the 16th century for a large number of Turkish public [[Turkish bath|hamams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{mk icon}} [http://www.architect.mk/arhitektura/domashna/63-akvadukt-skopje Аквадукт Скопје, www.architect.mk, accessdate=2010-08-25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918022526/http://architect.mk/arhitektura/domashna/63-akvadukt-skopje |date=2010-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This aqueduct was in use until the eighteenth century.  Only about {{convert|386|m|sp=us}} with 55 arches of this structure of stone and brick remain. It is assumed that the aqueduct took water from the spring Lavovec (village Gluvo in mountain [[Skopska Crna Gora]]), {{convert|9|km|sp=us}} northwest from Skopje and brought water to city center.

'''Sound Transmission Class''' (or '''STC''') is an  [[integer]] rating of how well a [[building]] [[wall|partition]] attenuates airborne [[sound]].  In the USA, it is widely used to rate interior partitions, ceilings/floors, doors, windows and exterior wall configurations (see [[ASTM]] International Classification E413 and E90).  Outside the USA, the [[Sound Reduction Index|Sound Reduction Index (SRI)]] [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] index or its related indices are used. As of 2012, these are defined in the ISO - 140 series of standards (under revision).

The STC rating figure very roughly reflects the [[decibel]] reduction in noise that a partition can provide. 

== Rating methodology ==

The ASTM sound transmission loss test methods have changed every few years. Thus, STC results posted before 1999 may not produce the same results today, and the differences become wider as one goes further back in time–the differences in the applicable test methods between the 1970s and today being quite significant.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
[[File:Sound-Transmission-Class-Report-Sample.jpg|thumb|Sound Transmission Class Report Sample from ''[[NTi Audio]]'' showing Transmission Loss in the sixteen standard frequencies]]

The STC number is derived from sound [[attenuation]] values tested at sixteen standard [[frequency|frequencies]] from 125 [[Hertz|Hz]] to 4000&amp;nbsp;Hz. These [[Transmission Loss]] values are then plotted on a sound pressure level graph and the resulting curve is compared to a standard reference contour. Acoustical engineers fit these values to the appropriate ''TL'' Curve (or ''T''ransmission ''L''oss) to determine an STC rating. The measurement is accurate for speech sounds, but much less so for amplified music, mechanical equipment noise, transportation noise, or any sound with substantial low-frequency energy below 125&amp;nbsp;Hz. Sometimes, acoustical labs will measure TL at frequencies below the normal STC boundary of 125&amp;nbsp;Hz, possibly down to 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or lower, thus giving additional valuable data to evaluate transmission loss at very low frequencies, such as a [[subwoofer]]-rich home theater system would produce. Alternatively, [[Outdoor-Indoor Transmission Class]] (OITC) is a standard used for indicating the rate of transmission of sound between outdoor and indoor spaces in a structure that considers frequencies down to 80&amp;nbsp;Hz (Aircraft/Rail/Truck traffic) and is weighted more to lower frequencies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

== Sound Isolation Techniques ==

The following sound isolation results and methodologies are presented with data that is measured within the standard frequency range specified by appropriate ASTM standards. Although it is worthwhile to discuss the utility of sound transmission loss data that lies outside the standard frequency range (especially in the low-frequency region), for simplicity results will be primarily be presented and discussed within these standard limitations.

Typical interior walls in homes (1 sheet of 1/2″ (13&amp;nbsp;mm) gypsum wallboard ([[drywall]]) on either side of a 2x4 (90&amp;nbsp;mm) wood studs spaced 16" (406&amp;nbsp;mm) on-center with fiberglass insulation filling each stud cavity) have an STC of about 33.&lt;ref name="archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"&gt;NRC IRC IR-761, http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/ir/ir761/ir761.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to rate their acoustical performance, people often describe these walls as "paper thin." They offer little in the way of privacy. Multi-family demising partition walls are typically constructed with varying gypsum wallboard panel layers attached to both sides of double 2x4 (90&amp;nbsp;mm) wood studs spaced 16" (406&amp;nbsp;mm) on-center and separated by a 1" (25&amp;nbsp;mm) airspace. These double-stud walls vary in sound isolation performance from the mid STC-40s into the high STC-60s depending on the presence of insulation and the gypsum wallboard type and quantity.&lt;ref name="archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"/&gt; Commercial buildings are typically constructed using [[wall_stud|steel studs]] of varying widths, gauges, and on-center spacings. Each of these framing characteristics have an effect on the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees.&lt;ref&gt;Sound and Vibration Magazine, March 2010, http://www.sandv.com/downloads/1003beti.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sound Absorption ===

Adding absorptive materials to the interior surfaces of rooms (e.g. fabric-faced fiberglass panels, thick curtains) will result in a decrease of reverberated sound energy within the room. However, absorptive interior surface treatments do not significantly improve the sound isolation from one room to another through demising partitions over the typical frequency range measured currently.&lt;ref&gt;The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, Vol. 63 No. 6 pp 1851-1856, http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/63/6/10.1121/1.381924&lt;/ref&gt; Installing absorptive insulation (e.g., fiberglass batts, blow-in cellulose, mineral fiber batts) into the wall or ceiling cavities affects the sound isolation of the partition to varying degrees, depending on the framing configuration and joist or stud depth.&lt;ref name="archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"/&gt; For example, the presence of type of insulation in single 2x4 wood stud framing spaced 16" (406&amp;nbsp;mm) on-center results in only a few STC points. In contrast, adding standard fiberglass insulation to an otherwise empty cavity in light-gauge (25-gauge or lighter) [[wall_stud|steel stud partitions]] can result in a nearly 10 STC-point improvement. As the stud gauge becomes heavier, the presence and type of insulation matters less.

=== Mass ===

The effect of adding multiple layers of gypsum wallboard to a frame also varies depending on the framing type and configuration.&lt;ref name="NRC IRC IR-761 2010"&gt;NRC IRC IR-761, http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/ir/ir761/ir761.pdf and Sound and Vibration Magazine March 2010, http://www.sandv.com/downloads/1003beti.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Doubling the mass of a partition does not double the STC, as the STC is calculated from a non-linear decibel sound transmission loss measurement.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E413 Classification for Rating Sound Insulation, https://www.astm.org/Standards/E413.htm&lt;/ref&gt; So, whereas installing an additional layer of gypsum wallboard to a light-gauge (25-ga. or lighter) [[Wall_stud|steel stud partition]] will result in about a 5 STC-point increase, doing the same on single wood or single heavy-gauge steel will result in only 2 to 3 additional STC points.&lt;ref name="NRC IRC IR-761 2010"/&gt; Adding a second additional layer (to the already 3-layer system) does not result in as drastic an STC change as the first additional layer.&lt;ref name="archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca"/&gt; The effect of additional gypsum wallboard layers on double- and staggered-stud partitions is similar to that of light-gauge steel partitions. Due to increased mass, poured concrete and concrete blocks typically achieve higher STC values (in the mid STC 40s to the mid STC 50s) than equally thick framed walls.&lt;ref&gt;NRC IRC BRN-217, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.5.8583&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  However the additional weight, added complexity of construction, and poor thermal insulation tend to limit masonry wall partitions as a viable sound isolation solution in many building construction projects. Temperate climates and hurricane- or tornado-prone areas may, however, require the use of masonry walls for structural stability.

=== Decoupling ===

Structurally decoupling the gypsum wallboard panels from the partition framing can result in a large increase in sound isolation when installed correctly. Examples of structural decoupling in building construction include resilient channels, sound isolation clips and hat channels, and staggered- or double-stud framing. The STC results of decoupling in wall and ceiling assemblies varies significantly depending on the framing type, air cavity volume, and decoupling material type.&lt;ref&gt;NRC IRC-IR 761, http://archive.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/obj/irc/doc/pubs/ir/ir761/ir761.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Great care must be taken in each type of decoupled partition construction, as any fastener that becomes mechanically (rigidly) coupled to the framing can short-circuit the decoupling and result in drastically lower sound isolation results.&lt;ref&gt;LoVerde and Dong, Proceedings of 20th ICA 2010, https://www.acoustics.asn.au/conference_proceedings/ICA2010/cdrom-ICA2010/papers/p221.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Damping ===

Sound damping tapes and other materials have been used to reduce both vibration and sound transmission through materials since the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer, Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics Vol. 19, http://scitation.aip.org/docserver/fulltext/asa/journal/poma/19/1/1.4800606.pdf?expires=1472756005&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=71F9E802F9301F8DFFD6A3204B70092A&lt;/ref&gt; Although the applications of sound damping was largely limited to defense and industrial applications such as naval vessels and aircraft in the past, recent research has proven the effectiveness of damping in interior sound isolation in buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer and Tinianov, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America Vol. 130, http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/130/4/10.1121/1.3654567&lt;/ref&gt; Constrained-layer damping gypsum wallboard panels increase sound isolation in building partitions by drastically reducing the vibration of panels and, incidentally, the radiation of sound through panels. The shear loading of a highly visco-elastic interlayer sandwiched between two more rigid constraining layers causes decreased displacement due to vibration, reducing the amount of sound energy radiated through a panel between enclosures.&lt;ref&gt;Cremer and Heckl, Structure-borne Sound&lt;/ref&gt; Damped gypsum wallboard panels are effective in reducing sound transmission over a broad range of frequencies and especially useful for achieving high levels of speech privacy between partitions.&lt;ref&gt;Shafer and Tinianov, The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America Vol. 129, http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/129/4/10.1121/1.3588934&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Addressing Sound Flanking ===

Sound isolation metrics, such as the STC, are measured in specially-isolated and designed laboratory test chambers. It is important to note that there are nearly infinite field conditions that will affect sound isolation ''in situ'' when designing or remodeling building partitions and enclosures. Partitions that are inadequately or inappropriately sealed—that contain  back-to-back electrical boxes, untreated recessed lighting, and unsealed pipes to name just a few—provide flanking paths for sound. Sound flanking paths include any sound transmission path other than the wall or ceiling partition itself. Great care and caution must be applied to any acoustically-treated building partition to ensure that the field sound isolation performance more closely approaches laboratory-tested values (see data from the National Research Council of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/ibp/irc/bsi/85-accoustics.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315182501/http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/ibp/irc/bsi/85-accoustics.html |archivedate=2010-03-15 |df= }} Acoustics in Practice&lt;/ref&gt;)

== Legal and practical requirements ==

Section 1207 of International Building Code 2006 states that separation between dwelling units and public and service areas must achieve STC 50 (STC 45 if field tested) for both airborne and structure-borne.  However, not all jurisdictions use the IBC 2006 for their building or municipal code.  In jurisdictions where IBC 2006 is used, this requirement may not apply to all dwelling units.  For example, a building conversion may not need to meet this rating for all walls.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In serious cases (e.g., a bedroom adjacent to a home theater room, and an inconsiderate nocturnal neighbor, to boot) a partition to reduce sounds from high-powered home theater or stereo should ideally be STC 70 or greater, and show good attenuation at low frequencies. An STC 70 wall can require detailed design and construction and can be easily compromised by '[[flanking noise]]', sound traveling around the partition through the contiguous frame of the structure, thus reducing the STC significantly. STC 65 to 70 walls are often designed into luxury multifamily units, dedicated home theaters, and high end hotels.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

'''''Speed Racer: Race to the Future''''' is a 2013 Indian-American [[flash animation|flash]] [[animated]] film based on [[Tatsuo Yoshida]]'s ''[[Speed Racer]]'' [[manga]] franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speed Racer "Race to the Future" on Vimeo|url=https://vimeo.com/81550687|date=December 10, 2013|accessdate=November 28, 2016|first=Robert|last=Fuentes|work=[[Vimeo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was directed by Robert H. Fuentes III and produced by [[Toonz Entertainment]] for [[Imira Entertainment]]. Unlike Toonz's work on the second season of ''[[Speed Racer: The Next Generation]]'', ''Race for the Future'' is set in the universe of the original animated series.

[[Viva Pictures]] acquired the rights to distribute the film in [[North America]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jennifer|last=Wolfe|title= Imira Entertainment’s ‘The Aviators’ Flies to North America|url=http://www.awn.com/news/imira-entertainment-s-aviators-flies-north-america|accessdate=November 28, 2016|date=April 16, 2015|work=[[Animation World Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through [[Cinedigm]], the film was released [[direct-to-video]] on [[DVD]] and [[streaming media|streaming]] platforms on January 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Speed Racer Race to the Future - New Video Digital - Cinedigm|url=http://www.newvideo.com/new-video-digital/speed-racer-race-to-the-future/|accessdate=November 28, 2016|work=[[New Video]]|publisher=[[Cinedigm]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike using the anime-style tradition, which the Speed Racer series was known for, the film utilizes a different style of animation.

==Plot==
To prevent car accident fatalities, Pops Racer and his company develop an orb that can send a vehicle and its occupants 15-seconds back in time. Fearing for his son's safety during a race in poor conditions, and without Speed's knowledge, Pops installs the object in the [[Mach 5]] before it can be properly tested. Just as the race begins, a bolt of lightning strikes the car sending Speed, Trixie, Sparky, Spritle and Chim-Chim fifty years into the future.

Now in 2062, the group is immediately arrested and brought to a sorting facility where the Mach-5 is seized. A robot parole officer explains that in an effort to keep humans safe, all labor is now handled by machines designed by Leland Industries, a company that formerly competed with Pops Motors in automotive sports. After tricking the robot into telling them the location of the Mach 5, the group comes across Sparky's son, who operates the recycling plant. He reveals that their future selves were imprisoned 10 years ago for starting the Road Rebels, a resistance group that's against a society run by robots due to a fear of eventual human enslavement. Claiming it would be futile to try to defeat Leland, Speed instead suggests they travel back in time to prevent the company from ever gaining that level of control. Sparky's son notes that the only way to afford an energy source powerful enough to fuel that level of time travel would be to win the Super Dome 1000, an exceedingly difficult racing event for robots. To prepare, the crew uses the plant's scrap vehicles to upgrade the Mach 5 to the Mach 5 Ultra. Speed, under the disguise as a robot named Speed Demon, and the group arrive at the arena where they're greeted by John Leland Jr., the owner of Leland Industries. Impressed by the Mach 5 Ultra and Speed Demon's design, he offers to buy them from Trixie should they finish the race.

The Road Rebels launch an attack on the streets just as the event begins. Trixie, Spritle and Chim-Chim assist in the offensive and get picked up by one of their members, Sparky's future wife Jennifer. Seeing Jennifer's glee at being able to see a version of her missing husband, Trixie is convinced to expose Leland's goals. Against Speed's orders, she and the rest of the group, including Sparky's son and Racer X, concoct a plan to disable Leland Industries' security and delete any of their ulterior motives, while Jennifer, Spritle and Chim-Chim stay on lookout. However, Leland Jr. catches on to the ruse when Trixie walks into his office and has the three detained by his robots. Outside, the parole robot from earlier catches up on Jennifer, Spritle and Chim-Chim, sounding the alarm to Leland's police robots who capture them.

As the third segment of the race begins, one of the competitors slams Speed into a pillar revealing his identity to the world and disqualifying him from the prize money. As Leland realizes the plot to go back in time and prevent his company's rise, the crowd cheers Speed on, convincing him to keep racing. Confused as to Speed's new motive, Leland reveals that he isn't actually a human, but an android built by the company's late founder. Fearing Speed may encourage a major rebellion, Leland then changes the prime directive of all robots from protecting humans to enslaving them.

Trixie, Racer X, Sparky's son, Jennifer, Spritle, Chim-Chim, and the now captured Sparky, quickly escape from the containment bay and plan another assault on Leland Industries. Trixie calls Speed and tells him to join the attack, but he refuses. 100 miles from the finish, he makes his move to take first place, but in the struggle drives the Mach 5 Ultra off the track, plummeting into a pool. A 92-year-old Pops Racer rushes out from the sidelines to his son's rescue, activating the time orb and sending the Mach 5 Ultra back in the past and in the race. While talking to his father, Speed realizes that he can't just go back to the past and hope to prevent this future. Activating the Mach 5 Ultra's new hover functionality, he flies out of the stadium to rally nearby humans into confronting Leland. Leland then gets into his own jet to engage Speed. With the office empty, Sparky and his son try to shutdown the invasion plan while Trixie, Racer X and Jennifer mount a ground assault against the robots.

Speed eventually gets the upper hand in his dogfight with Leland by pretending to have lost flying functionality. As the android goes in to kill Speed, the Mach 5 Ultra suddenly flies causing Leland to crash. Just as that happens, Sparky successfully disables the robot army. They rush outside to tell everyone the good news and to install the power cell needed to take them back to the past. Sparky finishes up on the Mach 5 Ultra and the group begin to head home. Just as they do, Leland reactivates and chases them to the time warp portal. The group narrowly evades his attack and pass through as Leland crashes into the closing gate and explodes.

Back in their time, Sparky makes plans to go on his first date with Jennifer as Speed apologizes to his father for being so reckless. Elsewhere, a shadowy figure steals the time orb.

Over the course of competition history, the most successful chorus has been ''[[Melodeers Chorus]] ''from [[Chicago]] with seven championship titles, and the most successful quartet singer was Connie Noble who won with four separate quartets. ''Lustre Quartet'' from [[Baltimore]] holds the record for highest quartet score, and ''[[Rönninge Show Chorus]]'' from [[Stockholm]] for highest ever chorus score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url= http://pure.ltu.se/portal/en/publications/assessment-of-musical-quality(0daaa4dc-f4bb-4979-9d20-378354dae2ab).html|title= Assessment of musical quality: a case study of achieving a World Champion title in chorus singing|first1= Susanna|last1= Leijonhufvud|last2= Nyberg |first2 = Johan|author-link= |date= 25 April 2014  |conference= Nordic Network for Research in Music Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The first convention was held in Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1947 for quartets&amp;nbsp;– two years after the foundation of the first ''Sweet Adelines Inc.'' chapter in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Vocalists To Form 'Sweet Adelines' Group|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2310471/sweet_adelines_first_convention/|newspaper=[[The Miami Daily News-Record]]|date=3 October 1947|page=1|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate =27 April 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Women Will Form Sweet Adelines Inc.|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2310436/sweet_adelines_first_convention/|newspaper=[[Joplin Globe]]|date=3 October 1947|page=12|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate = 27 April 2015}} {{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was expanded to include choruses in 1973 and in 2000 the Harmony Classic competition for small and medium-sized choruses was introduced. Originally, Harmony Classic was held independently but since 2009 all three are now hosted together and run over the course of the convention week. A fourth event, the "Rising Star" competition, was introduced in 1999 for quartets whose members are under-25 years old. It was also held as part of convention from 2009 until 2012 but due to scheduling and cost constraints is now held independently again. Many non-competitive performances are also held during convention week, including by the previous year's chorus and quartet champions.

The convention is usually held in a city in the [[continental United States]] but has thrice been held internationally (England 1977, Canada 1962, 2007) and four times in Hawaii (1969, 1987, 2008, 2013). A "spectacular fifty-year anniversary celebration" was held in New Orleans during the 1995 convention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Barbershop Singer: Inside the Social World of a Musical Hobby|last = Stebbins|first = Robert|publisher = University of Toronto Press|year = 1996|isbn = 9780802078292|location = |pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|50 and Forward|1995}} and the competition was to be held there a decade later in 2005, but was moved due to [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.acappellanews.com/archive/000900.html|title = Sweet Adelines Convention Cancelled|date = 31 August 2005|accessdate = 26 April 2015|website = A Cappella News|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2015 to 2017, the city of Las Vegas hosted the convention&amp;nbsp;– the first time that the event has stayed in the same location for more than one year.

[[File:Japanese tea ceremony 20100502 Japan Matsuri 02.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A Japanese woman performs a [[tea ceremony]]]]

'''Tea culture''' is defined by the way [[tea]] is made and consumed, by the way the people interact with tea, and by the aesthetics surrounding tea drinking. It includes aspects of tea production, tea brewing, tea arts and ceremony, society, history, health, ethics, education, and communication and media issues.

Tea plays an important role in some countries. It is commonly consumed at social events, and many cultures have created intricate formal ceremonies for these events. [[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|Afternoon tea]] is a British custom with widespread appeal. [[Tea ceremony|Tea ceremonies]], with their roots in the [[Chinese tea culture]], differ among Asian countries, such as the [[Japanese tea ceremony|Japanese]] or [[Korean tea ceremony|Korean versions]]. Tea may differ widely in preparation, such as in Tibet, where the beverage is commonly brewed with salt and butter. Tea may be drunk in small private gatherings ([[Tea party (social gathering)|tea parties]]) or in public ([[tea house]]s designed for social interaction).

The [[British Empire]] spread its own interpretation of tea to its dominions and colonies, including regions that today comprise the states of [[Tea culture#Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Tea culture#India|India]], and [[Tea culture#Pakistan|Pakistan]], which had pre-existing tea customs, as well as regions such as East Africa (modern day Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda) and the Pacific ([[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]) which did not have tea customs. [[Teahouse|The tea room or teahouse]] is found in the US, the UK, and Ireland.

Different regions favor different varieties of tea—[[black tea|black]], [[green tea|green]], or [[oolong tea|oolong]]—and use different flavourings, such as herbs, milk, or sugar. The temperature and strength of the tea likewise vary widely.

==Bubble tea==
{{Main article|Bubble tea}}
Bubble tea, pearl milk tea (Chinese: 珍珠奶茶; pinyin: zhēnzhū nǎichá), or boba milk tea (波霸奶茶; bōbà nǎichá) is a tea beverage mixture with milk which includes balls of tapioca. Originating in [[Taiwan]], it is especially popular in East Asia, including Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, as well as [[Europe]], [[Canada]], and the [[United States]]. It is also known as black pearl tea or tapioca tea.

[[Taiwanese tea culture]] also encompasses a more traditional tea culture inspired by China and Han immigrants to the island. Wild tea was first found in Taiwan by the Dutch East India Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teafromtaiwan.com/taiwan_tea_history|title=Taiwan Tea History}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Successive waves of immigration to Taiwan have left a legacy of influences on tea culture.

Due to the importance of tea in Chinese society and culture, tea houses can be found in most Chinese neighbourhoods and business districts. Chinese-style tea houses offer dozens of varieties of hot and cold tea concoctions. They also serve a variety of tea-friendly or tea-related snacks. Beginning in the late afternoon, the typical Chinese tea house quickly becomes packed with students and business people, and later at night plays host to insomniacs and night owls simply looking for a place to relax.

There are formal tea houses. They provide a range of Chinese and Japanese tea leaves, as well as tea making accoutrements and a better class of snack food. Finally there are tea vendors, who specialize in the sale of tea leaves, pots, and other related paraphernalia. Tea is an important item in Chinese culture and is mentioned in the ''[[Seven necessities]] of (Chinese) daily life''.

====Two periods====
{{See also|History of tea in China}}
In [[China]], at least as early as the [[Tang Dynasty]], tea was an object of connoisseurship; in the [[Song Dynasty]] formal tea-tasting parties were held, comparable to modern wine tastings. As much as in modern wine tastings, the proper vessel was important and much attention was paid to matching the tea to an aesthetically appealing serving vessel.

Historically there were two phases of tea drinking in China based on the form of tea that was produced and consumed, namely: ''tea bricks'' versus ''loose leaf tea''.

=====Tea brick phase=====
[[File:Russiantea1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A tea brick made for the Russian Imperial Army of Czar Nicholas II]]
Tea served before the [[Ming Dynasty]] was typically made from [[tea brick]]s. Upon harvesting, the tea leaves were either partially dried or were thoroughly dried and ground before being pressed into bricks. The pressing of Pu-erh is likely a vestige of this process. Tea bricks were also sometimes used as currency.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2&lt;/ref&gt;  Serving the tea from tea bricks required multiple steps:
*''Toasting'': Tea bricks are usually first toasted over a fire to destroy any mould or insects that may have burrowed into the tea bricks. Such infestation sometimes occurred since the bricks were stored openly in warehouses and storerooms. Toasting likely imparted a pleasant flavour to the resulting tea.
*''Grinding'': The tea brick was broken up and ground to a fine powder. This practice survives in Japanese powdered tea (''Matcha'').
*''Whisking'': The powdered tea was mixed into hot water and frothed with a whisk before serving. The colour and patterns formed by the powdered tea were enjoyed while the mixture was imbibed.

The ground and whisked teas used at that time called for dark and patterned bowls in which the texture of the tea powder suspension could be enjoyed. The best of these bowls, glazed in patterns with names like oil spot, partridge-feather, hare's fur, and tortoise shell, are highly valued today. The patterned holding bowl and tea mixture were often lauded in the period's poetry with phrases such as "partridge in swirling clouds" or "snow on hare's fur". Tea in this period was enjoyed more for its patterns and less for its flavour. The practice of using powdered tea can still be seen in the Japanese Tea ceremony or ''[[Chadō]]''.

=====Loose-leaf tea phase=====
[[File:Tea pots.jpg|thumb|Five Yixing clay teapots showing a variety of styles from formal to whimsical]]
After 1391, the [[Hongwu Emperor]], the founder of the [[Ming Dynasty]], decreed that tributes of tea to the court were to be changed from brick to loose-leaf form. The imperial decree quickly transformed the tea drinking habits of the people, changing from whisked teas to steeped teas. The arrival of the new method for preparing tea also required the creation or use of new vessels.

*The [[tea pot]] was needed such that the tea leaves can be [[steeped]] separately from the drinking vessel for an [[infusion]] of proper concentration. The tea needs to be kept warm and the tea leaves must be separated from the resulting infusion when required.
*''[[Tea caddy|Tea caddies]]'' and containers also became necessary to keep the tea and conserve its flavour. This was because tea leaves do not preserve as well as tea bricks. Furthermore, the natural aroma of tea became the focus of the tea drinking due to the new preparation method.
*A change in Chinese tea ''drinking vessels'' was evident at this point. Smaller bowls with plain or simple designs on the interior surfaces were favoured over the larger patterned bowls used for enjoying the patterns created by powdered teas. Tea drinking in small bowls and cups was likely adopted since it gathers and directs the fragrant steam from the tea to the nose and allows for better appreciation of the tea's flavour.
[[Teaware]]s made with a special kind of [[yixing clay|purple clay]] (Zisha) from [[Yixing]] went on to develop during this period ([[Ming Dynasty]]). The structure of purple clay made it advantageous material with tiny and high density, preferred for heat preservation and perviousness.
Simplicity and rusticity dominated the idea of purple clay teaware decoration art. It became soon the most popular method of performing [[Gongfu tea ceremony|Chinese tea ceremony]], which often combines literature, [[calligraphy]], [[painting]] and [[seal cutting]] in Chinese culture.

The loose-leaf tea and the purple clay teaware is still the preferred method of preparing tea in Chinese daily life.

===Hong Kong===
The English-style tea has evolved into a new local style of drink, the [[Hong Kong-style milk tea]], more often simply "milk tea", in [[Hong Kong]] by using [[evaporated milk]] instead of ordinary milk. It is popular at ''[[cha chaan teng]]s'' and fast food shops such as [[Café de Coral]] and Maxims Express. [[Chinese tea|Traditional Chinese tea]], including [[green tea]], [[flower tea]], [[jasmine tea]], and [[Pu-erh tea]], are also common, and are served at [[dim sum]] restaurant during ''[[yum cha]]''.

=== Korea ===
''Main article: [[Korean tea ceremony]]''

The Korean tea ceremony or ''darye'' (茶禮) is a traditional form of [[tea ceremony]] practiced in [[Korea]]. Darye literally refers to ''"etiquette for tea"'' or ''"tea rite."'' The chief element of the Korean tea ceremony is the ease and naturalness of enjoying tea within an easy formal setting. Central to the Korean approach to tea is an easy and natural coherence, with fewer formal rituals, fewer absolutes, greater freedom for relaxation, and more creativity in enjoying a wider variety of teas, services, and conversation.

===Japan===

{{Main article|Japanese tea ceremony}}

[[Green tea|Green tea's]] traditional role in Japanese society is as a drink for special guests and special occasions. Green tea is served in many companies during afternoon breaks. Japanese often buy sweets for their colleagues when on vacation or business trips. These snacks are usually enjoyed with green tea. Tea will also be prepared for visitors coming for meetings to companies and for guests visiting Japanese homes. A thermos full of green tea is a staple on family or school outings as an accompaniment to [[bento]] (box lunches). Families often bring along proper [[Chawan|Japanese teacups]] to enhance the enjoyment of the traditional drink.

The strong cultural association the Japanese have with green tea has made it the most popular beverage to drink with traditional Japanese cuisine, such as [[sushi]], [[sashimi]], and [[tempura]]. At a restaurant, a cup of green tea is often served with meals at no extra charge, with as many refills as desired. The best traditional Japanese restaurants take as much care in choosing the tea they serve as in preparing the food itself.
[[File:Powderedgreentea.jpg|thumb|right|Cup of [[Matcha]] tea and sweet cake]]
Many Japanese are still taught the proper art of the centuries-old [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] as well. Still, the Japanese now enjoy green tea processed using state of the art technology. Today, hand pressing—a method demonstrated to tourists—is taught only as a technique preserved as a part of the Japanese cultural tradition. Most of the ubiquitous vending machines also carry a wide selection of both hot and cold bottled teas. [[Oolong tea]] enjoys considerable popularity. [[Black tea]], often with milk or lemon, is served ubiquitously in cafes, coffee shops, and restaurants.

Major tea-producing areas in Japan include [[Shizuoka Prefecture]] and the city of [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] in [[Kyoto Prefecture]].

Other infusions bearing the name ''cha'' are barley tea (''mugi-cha'') which is popular as a cold drink in the summer, buckwheat tea (''soba-cha''), and [[hydrangea]] tea (''ama-cha'').

===Tibet===
[[File:Tibetan butter tea.jpg|thumb|Butter tea in a bowl]]
Butter, milk, and salt are added to brewed tea and churned to form a hot drink called [[Po cha]] (''bod ja'', where ''bod'' means Tibetan and ''ja'' tea) in [[Tibet]] [[Bhutan|,Bhutan]], and [[Nepal|Nepal]]. The concoction is sometimes called ''cha su mar'', mainly in Kham, or Eastern Tibet. Traditionally, the drink is made with a domestic brick tea and [[yak]]'s milk, then mixed in a churn for several minutes. Using a generic black tea, milk and butter, and shaking or blending work well too, although the unique taste of yak milk is difficult to replicate. (see [https://web.archive.org/web/20080730010343/http://www.tanc.org/new_food/pocha.html recipe])

Tibet tea drinking has many rules. One such concerns an invitation to a house for tea. The host will first pour some highland barley wine. The guest must dip his finger in the wine and flick some away. This will be done three times to represent respect for the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. The cup will then be refilled two more times and on the last time it must be emptied or the host will be insulted. After this the host will present a gift of butter tea to the guest, who will accept it without touching the rim of the bowl. The guest will then pour a glass for himself, and must finish the glass or be seen as rude.

There are two main teas that go with the tea culture. The teas are butter tea and sweet milk tea. These two teas are only found in Tibet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Other teas that the Tibetans enjoy are boiled black teas. There are many tea shops in Tibet selling these teas, which travelers often take for their main hydration source.

==Southeast Asia==
===Myanmar===
[[Myanmar]] (formerly Burma) is one of very few countries where tea is not only drunk but eaten as '''[[lahpet]]'''—pickled tea served with various accompaniments.&lt;ref name="Thanegi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no113/myanmartimes6-113/Timeouts/1.htm|title=A World filled with Tea|author=Ma Thanegi|publisher=''[[Myanmar Times]]'' vol.6 no.113|accessdate=2007-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070927184230/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no113/myanmartimes6-113/Timeouts/1.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no37/timeout_4.htm|title=The Travelling Gourmet|publisher=''[[Myanmar Times]]'' no.37|accessdate=2007-04-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184049/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no37/timeout_4.htm|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called ''lahpet so'' (tea wet) in contrast to ''lahpet chauk'' (tea dry) or ''akyan jauk'' (crude dry) with which green tea—''yeinway jan'' or ''lahpet yeijan'' meaning plain or crude tea—is made. In the [[Shan State]] of Myanmar where most of the tea is grown, and also [[Kachin State]], tea is dry-roasted in a pan before adding boiling water to make green tea.&lt;ref name="Thanegi"/&gt; It is the national drink in a predominantly [[Buddhist]] country with no national tipple other than the [[palm wine|palm toddy]]. Tea sweetened with milk is known as ''lahpet yeijo'' made with ''acho jauk'' (sweet dry) or black tea and prepared the [[India]]n way, brewed and sweetened with condensed milk. It is a very popular drink although the middle classes by and large appear to prefer coffee most of the time. It was introduced to Myanmar by Indian immigrants some of whom set up teashops known as ''kaka hsaing'', later evolving to just ''lahpetyei hsaing'' (teashop).

====Social nexus====
{{tone|date=February 2017}}
Burma's street culture is basically a tea culture&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; as people, mostly men but also women and families, hang out in tea shops reading the paper or chatting away with friends, exchanging news, gossip and jokes, nursing cups of Indian tea served with a diverse range of snacks from cream cakes to [[China|Chinese]] fried breadsticks ([[youtiao]]) and steamed buns ([[baozi]]) to [[India]]n [[naan]] bread and [[samosa]]s. Green tea is customarily the first thing to be served free of charge as soon as a customer sits down at a table in all restaurants as well as teashops.

Pubs and clubs, unlike in the West, have remained a minority pursuit so far. Teashops are found from the smallest village to major cities in every neighbourhood up and down the country.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; They are open from the crack of dawn for [[breakfast]] till late in the evening, and some are open 24 hours catering for long distance drivers and travellers. One of the most popular teashops in [[Yangon]] in the late 1970s was called ''Shwe Hleiga'' (Golden Stairs) by popular acclaim as it was just a pavement stall, with low tables and stools for the customers, at the bottom of a stairwell in downtown Yangon. Busy bus stops and terminals as well as markets have several teashops. Train journeys in Myanmar also feature hawkers who jump aboard with giant kettles of tea for thirsty passengers.

====Lahpet====
{{Main article|Lahpet}}
[[File:Laphet oke.JPG|thumb|Lahpet served in a lacquer dish]]
Lahpet (pickled tea) is served in one of two ways:
# ''A-hlu lahpet'' or [[Mandalay]] lahpet is served in a plate or traditionally in a shallow [[lacquerware]] dish called ''lahpet ohk'' with a lid and divided into small compartments—pickled tea laced with [[sesame]] oil in a central compartment, and other ingredients such as crisp fried garlic, peas and peanuts, toasted sesame, crushed dried shrimp, preserved shredded ginger and fried shredded coconut in other compartments encircling it. It may be served as a snack or after a meal with green tea either on special occasions or just for the family and visitors. ''A-hlu'' means alms and is synonymous with a novitiation ceremony called ''[[Shinbyu]]'' although lahpet is served in this form also at ''hsun jway'' (offering a meal to monks) and weddings. Invitation to a ''shinbyu'' is traditionally by calling from door to door with a ''lahpet ohk'', and acceptance is indicated by its partaking.
# ''Lahpet thouk'' or [[Yangon]] lahpet is pickled tea salad very popular all over Myanmar especially with women, and some teashops would have it on their menu as well as Burmese restaurants. It is prepared by mixing all the above ingredients without the coconut but in addition includes fresh tomatoes, garlic and green chilli, and is dressed with [[fish sauce]], sesame or peanut oil, and a squeeze of lime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innwa.com/dev/kitchen/news/get-news.asp?id=142|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060410024414/http://www.innwa.com/dev/kitchen/news/get-news.asp?id=142|archivedate=2006-04-10|title=Lephet - Green Tea Salad|last=Haber|first=Daniel|date=March 31, 2002|publisher=''Swe Sone'' magazine|accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most popular brands sold in packets include ''Ayee Taung lahpet'' from Mandalay, ''Shwe Toak'' from [[Mogok]], ''[[Yuzana Company|Yuzana]]'' and ''Pinpyo Ywetnu'' from Yangon.

===Thailand===
[[Thai tea]] (also known as Thai iced tea) or "cha-yen" ({{lang-th|ชาเย็น}}) when ordered in [[Thailand]] is a drink made from strongly-brewed [[black tea|red tea]] that usually contains added [[anise]], red and yellow [[food colouring]], and sometimes other spices as well. This tea is sweetened with [[sugar]] and [[condensed milk]] and served chilled. [[evaporated milk|Evaporated]] or whole milk is generally poured over the tea and ice before serving—it is never mixed before serving—to add taste and creamy appearance. Locally, it is served in a traditional tall glass and when ordered [[take-out]], it is poured over the crushed [[ice]] in a clear (or translucent) plastic bag. It can be made into a [[frappé coffee|frappé]] at more westernised vendors.

It is popular in [[Southeast Asia]] and in many American restaurants that serve [[Thai cuisine|Thai]] or [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]] food, especially on the West Coast. Although Thai tea is not the same as [[bubble tea]], a Southeast and East Asian beverage that contains large black pearls of [[tapioca]] [[starch]], Thai tea with pearls is a popular flavour of bubble tea.

Green tea is also very popular in Thailand, spawning many variations such as barley green tea, rose green tea, lemon green tea, etc. Thai green tea, however, is not to be confused with traditional Japanese green tea. Thai green tea tends to be very heavily commercialized and the taste is sweeter and easier to appreciate than bitter variations.

===Vietnam===
Tea is cultivated extensively in the north of the country, making [[Vietnam]] one of the world's largest exporters. The word in the [[Vietnamese language]] is trà (pronounced cha/ja) or chè. It is served unsweetened and unaccompanied by milk, cream, or lemon.

Traditionally tea is frequently consumed as [[green tea]] (trà xanh). Variants of [[black tea]] (chè tàu) is also widely used although frequently scented with ''[[Jasminum sambac]]'' blossoms (chè nhài, trà lài). [[Huế]] is renowned for its tea scented with ''[[Nelumbo nucifera]]'' [[stamen]]s (trà sen). 

In Vietnamese restaurants, including eateries overseas, a complimentary pot of tea is usually served once the meal has been ordered, with refills free of charge.

[[File:India - Varanasi Chai kettle - 0666.jpg|thumb|right|A chai wallah in Varanasi India pours a cup of tea]]
One of the world's largest producers of tea, [[India]] is a country where tea is popular all over as a breakfast and evening drink. It is often served as [[masala chai]] with milk, sugar, and spices such as ginger, cardamom, black pepper and cinnamon. Almost all the tea consumed is black Indian tea, [[Crush, Tear, Curl|CTC]] variety. Usually tea leaves are boiled in water while making tea, and milk is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chai+latte|title=the definition of chai latte|author=|date=|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Offering tea to visitors is the cultural norm in Indian homes, offices and places of business. Tea is often consumed at small roadside stands, where it is prepared by tea makers known as ''chai wallahs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a chai wallah? |url=http://chaiwallahsofindia.com/2013/04/chai-wallah/|work=Chai Wallahs of India|accessdate=30 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three most famous regions in India to produce black teas- [[Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling]][[Assam|,Assam]] and [[The Nilgiris District|Nilgiri]]. "Strong, heavy and fragrant" are 3 criteria for judging black tea.
[[Darjeeling tea]] is known for its delicate aroma and light colour and is aptly termed as "the champagne of teas", which has high aroma and yellow or brown liquid after brewing. [[Assam tea]] is known for its robust taste and dark colour, and [[Nilgiri tea]] is dark, intensely aromatic and flavoured. [[Assam]] produces the largest quantity of Tea in India, mostly of the [[Crush, Tear, Curl|CTC]] variety, and is one of the biggest suppliers of major international brands such as [[Lipton]] and [[Tetley]]. The Tetley Brand, formerly British owned and one of the largest, is now owned by the Indian [[Tata Tea Limited]] company.

On April 21, 2012 the Deputy Chairman of [[Planning Commission (India)]], [[Montek Singh Ahluwalia]], said that tea would be declared as national drink by April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3339621.ece |title=News - National: Tea will be declared a national drink, says Montek |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-30/india/31506187_1_tea-industry-black-tea-tea-output |title=Tea to get hotter with national drink tag? |publisher=Times Of India |date=2012-04-30 |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the occasion, former [[Assam]] Chief Minister [[Tarun Gogoi]] said a special package for the tea industry would be announced in the future to ensure its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/tea-to-be-declared-national-drink-montek/250865-3.html |title=Tea will be declared national drink: Montek Singh Ahluwalia - India |publisher=IBNLive |date=2012-04-21 |accessdate=2013-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was expected to boost the tea industry in the country, but in May 2013 the ministry of commerce decided not to declare a national drink for fear of disrupting the competing [[Coffee production in India|coffee industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharma|first=Mohit|title=Tea-coffee war brewing, national drink tag at stake|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Tea-coffee-war-brewing-national-drink-tag-at-stake/Article1-1059253.aspx|work=Hindustan Times|accessdate=1 July 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130608065052/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Tea-coffee-war-brewing-national-drink-tag-at-stake/Article1-1059253.aspx|archivedate=8 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
{{Main article|Pakistani tea culture}}
Tea is popular all over [[Pakistan]] and is referred to as ''chai'' (written as چائے). During [[History of Pakistan#Colonial era|British Rule]] tea became very popular in Lahore. Tea is usually consumed at breakfast, during lunch breaks at the workplace, and in the evening at home. Evening tea may be consumed with biscuits or cake. Guests are typically offered a choice between tea and soft drinks. It is common practice for homeowners to offer tea breaks to hired labour, and sometimes even provide them with tea during the breaks. Tea offered to labour is typically strong and has more sugar in it.

In [[Pakistan]], both [[black tea|black]] and [[green tea]]s are popular and are known locally as ''sabz chai'' and ''[[kahwah]]'', respectively. The popular green tea called [[kahwah]] is often served after every meal in [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] belt of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]]. In the [[Kashmir]] region of [[Pakistan]], Kashmiri chai or "[[Noon Chai|noon chai]]," a pink, milky tea with [[pistachios]] and [[cardamom]], is consumed primarily at special occasions, weddings, and during the winter months when it is sold in many kiosks. In [[Lahore]] and other cities of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] this Kashmiri Chai or Cha (as pronounced in Punjabi, Kosher as well as in many Chinese dialects ) is common drink in the Punjab, brought by ethnic Kashmiris in the 19th century. Traditionally, it is prepared with Himalayan rock salt, giving it its characteristic pink color. It is taken with Bakar Khani as well as Kashmiri Kulcha (namkeen / salty version of Khand Kulcha). Namkeen Chai or Noon / Loon Cha or commonly called Kashmri Chai and some times Sheer (milk ) Cha or sabz chai(Green Tea as the same tea are used for making Khahwa /Green Tea) is sold and seen Gowal Mandi kiosks with Salt for Kashmiri as well as with sugar and pistachios for Non- Kashmris or those who like it with sugar . In the northern Pakistan regions of [[Chitral]] and [[Gilgit-Baltistan]], a salty buttered Tibetan style tea is consumed.

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]], usually black tea is served with milk and sugar, but the milk is always warmed. Tea is a hugely popular beverage among the Sri-Lankan people, and part of its land is surrounded by the many hills of tea plantations that spread for miles. Drinking tea has become part of the culture of Sri Lanka and it is customary to offer a cup of tea to guests. Many working Sri Lankans are used to having a mid-morning cup of tea and another in the afternoon. Black tea is sometimes consumed with ginger. In rural areas some people still have their tea with a piece of sweet [[jaggery]]

==West Asia==
===Iran===
[[File:President Ali Khamenei in a Martyr's family house.jpg|thumb|An Iranian family catering [[black tea]] for President [[Ali Khamenei]] in their house, February 1987. ]]
Tea found its way to Persia ([[Iran]]) through the Silk Road from India and soon became the national drink. The whole part of northern Iran along the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]] is suitable for the cultivation of tea. Especially in the [[Gilan]] province on the slopes of [[Alborz]], large areas are under tea cultivation and millions of people work in the tea industry. That region covers a large part of Iran's need for tea. Iranians have one of the highest per capita rates of tea consumption in the world and since old times every street has had a ''Châikhâne'' ([[Tea House]]). Châikhânes are still an important social place. Iranians traditionally drink tea by pouring it into a saucer and putting a lump of [[Rock candy|rock sugar]] (''qand'') in the mouth before drinking the tea.

===Turkey===

As of 2016, [[Turkey]] tops the per capita tea consumption statistics at 6.96 pounds. &lt;ref name= "per capita 2016"&gt;[https://www.statista.com/statistics/507950/global-per-capita-tea-consumption-by-country/] 2016 tea per capita stat &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turkey|Turkish]] tea or Çay is produced on the eastern [[Black Sea Region|Black Sea]] coast, which has a mild climate with high precipitation and fertile soil. [[Turkish tea]] is typically prepared using [[çaydanlık]], an instrument especially designed for tea preparation. Water is brought to a boil in the larger lower kettle and then some of the water is used to fill the smaller kettle on top and steep several spoons of loose tea leaves, producing a very strong tea. When served, the remaining water is used to dilute the tea on an individual basis, giving each consumer the choice between strong ("koyu"/dark) or weak ("açık"/light). Tea is drunk from small glasses to enjoy it hot in addition to show its colour, with lumps of beetroot sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Egypt===
Tea is the national drink in [[Egypt]], and holds a special position that even coffee cannot rival. In Egypt, tea is called "shai".&lt;ref&gt;The book of cities by Philip Dodd&lt;/ref&gt; Tea packed and sold in Egypt is almost exclusively imported from [[Kenya]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The Egyptian government considers tea a strategic crop and runs large tea plantations in Kenya. [[Green tea]] is a recent arrival to Egypt (only in the late 1990s did green tea become affordable) and is not as popular.

Egyptian tea comes in two varieties: Koshary and Saiidi. Koshary tea, popular in Lower (Northern) Egypt, is prepared using the traditional method of steeping black tea in boiled water and letting it set for a few minutes. It is almost always sweetened with cane sugar and is often flavored with fresh [[menta|mint]] leaves. Adding milk is also common. Koshary tea is usually light, with less than a half [[teaspoon]]ful per cup considered to be near the high end.

Saiidi tea is common in Upper (Southern) Egypt. It is prepared by boiling [[black tea]] with water for as long as 5 minutes over a strong flame. Saiidi tea is extremely heavy, with 2 teaspoonfuls per cup being the norm. It is sweetened with copious amounts of cane sugar (a necessity since the formula and method yield a very bitter tea). Saiidi tea is often black even in liquid form.

Besides true tea, [[herbal tea]]s (or tisanes) are often served at the Egyptian teahouses, with ingredients ranging from [[Maghrebi mint tea|mint]] to [[cinnamon]] and [[ginger]] to [[salep]]; many of these are ascribed medicinal qualities or health benefits in Egyptian [[folk medicine]]. [[Karkade]], a tisane of [[hibiscus]] flowers, is a particularly popular beverage and is traditionally considered beneficial for the heart.

===Libya===
[[File:Tea and peanuts.jpg|thumb|Libyan Tea and peanuts]]
[[Libyan tea]] is a strong beverage, black or green, served in small glass cups with foam or froth topping the glass. it is usually sweetened with sugar and traditionally served in three rounds. mint or basil is used for flavoring and traditionally the last round is served with boiled peanuts or almonds.

===Mauritius===
Tea plays an important part in the island's culture. Tea drinking allows for socialising with it commonly being served to guests and in the workplace.

The Mauritian peoples usually consume black tea, often with milk and sugar. Mauritius is a producer of tea, initially on a small scale when the French introduced the plant into the island around 1765. It was under later British rule that the scale of tea cultivation increased.

Three major tea producers dominate the local market these are Bois Cheri, Chartreuse and Corson. The signature product is the vanilla-flavoured tea which is commonly bought and consumed on the island.

===Morocco===

[[File:The menthe.jpg|thumb|right|Moroccan mint tea]]
Morocco is considered the largest importer of [[green tea]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071103102427/http://www.angolapress-angop.ao/noticia-e.asp?ID=497915 Morocco tea imports from China hits $56 million mark] AngolaPress&lt;/ref&gt;

Tea was introduced to [[Morocco]] in the 18th century through trade with [[Europe]].

Morocco consumes [[green tea]] with [[menta|mint]] rather than black tea. It has become part of the culture and is used widely at almost every meal. The Moroccan people even make tea performance a special culture in the flower country. Moroccan tea is commonly served with rich tea cookies, fresh green mint leaves, local "finger shape" brown sugar, and colorful tea glasses and pots. Drinking Moroccan tea is not only a luxury of tongue, but also the eyes.

===Sahel===
[[File:Sahelian Tea Bild0766.jpg|thumb|right|Sahelian tea set]]
In the [[Sahel]] region on the southern fringe of the Sahara, [[Gunpowder tea|green gunpowder tea]] is prepared with little water and large amounts of sugar. By pouring the tea into the glasses and back, a foam builds on top of the tea. Sahelian tea is a social occasion and three infusions, the first one very bitter, the second in between and the last one rather sweet are taken in the course of several hours.

Tea is an important social beverage to [[Somali people]]. It is called ''shaah'' in the [[Somali language]]. Tea was first introduced to Somalis through ancient trade with the Arabs and Indians. In major Somali towns there are many tea shops and tea stalls around busy market areas. Somalis consume tea at any time of the day but primarily at breakfast, in the late afternoon, called ''Asariyo'', and after or during supper. Any guest to a Somali household would be offered spiced Somali tea, known as ''Shaah Hawash'', as soon as he or she arrives. The tea is spiced with [[cardamom]], [[cloves]] and sometimes dry [[ginger]] and is usually served milky and sweet. Tea is usually preferred over coffee in Somalia, however some Somalis prefer coffee over tea.

Somalis usually drink tea with camel milk, but it's customary to serve black tea if it is to be consumed after a heavy meal. It is called ''Shaah Bigaysi''.

Tea in Central Asia is known since foundation of [[Silk Way]]. In Kazakhstan traditional tea is black traditionally with milk, in Uzbekistan trational tea is green.

==Central Europe==

===Czech Republic===
Specific tea culture has developed in the [[Czech Republic]] in recent years,{{when|date=March 2016}} including many styles of [[teahouse|tearooms]]. Despite having the same name, they differ from British tearooms.{{clarify|date=August 2018}} Pure teas are usually prepared with respect to their country of origin, and good tea palaces may offer 80 teas from almost all tea-producing countries. Different tea rooms have also created blends and methods of preparation and serving.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Germany===
[[File:German - Teapot - Walters 482092.jpg|thumb|left|A German teapot with a hinged lid, 18th century]]
The region of [[East Friesland|East Frisia]] is noted for its consumption of tea and its tea culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ostfriesland-tourism.com/culinary/tealand-ostfriesland.html Tea Ceremony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318131448/http://www.ostfriesland-tourism.com/culinary/tealand-ostfriesland.html |date=2012-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong blends of [[Assam tea]], Ceylon and Darjeeling (East-Frisian Blend) are served whenever there are visitors to an East Frisian home or other gathering, as well as with breakfast, mid-afternoon, and mid-evening.

The traditional preparation is as follows: A ''Kluntje'', a white [[rock candy]] sugar that melts slowly, is added to the empty cup (allowing multiple cups to be sweetened) then tea is poured over the Kluntje. A [[heavy cream]] "cloud" ("Wölkje"—a diminutive of 'cloud' in Frisian)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landsichten.de/niedersachsen/urlaubsregionen/nordsee/Ostfriesland.html|title=Ostfriesland|author=|date=|website=landsichten.de|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is added to the tea "water", the sugar represents "land". It is served without a spoon and traditionally drunk unstirred, i. e. in three tiers: In the beginning one predominantly tastes the cream, then the tea and finally the sweet taste of kluntje at the bottom of the cup. Stirring the tea would blend all three tiers into one and spoil the traditional tea savouring. The tea is generally served with small cookies during the week and cakes during special occasions or on weekends as a special treat.[[File:Thumb DSCN0707 1024.jpg|thumb|East Frisian tea served in traditional patterned tea service.]] The tea is said to cure headaches, stomach problems, and stress, among many other ailments. The tea set is commonly decorated with an East Friesian Rose design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesmoor-info.de/html/ostfriesen_tea.html|title=Ostfriesen Tea|author=|date=|website=www.wiesmoor-info.de|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a guest, it is considered impolite to drink fewer than three cups of tea. Placing your cup upside down on the saucer or your spoon in the cup signals that you are finished and want no more tea.

===Slovakia===
Although less visible than in the Czech Republic, tea culture exists in [[Slovakia]]. [[Tea room]]s are considered an underground environment by many, but they continue to pop up almost in every middle-sized town. These tea rooms are appreciated for offering quiet environments with pleasant music. More importantly, they are usually non-smoking, unlike most pubs and cafés.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Eastern Europe==

===Russia===
{{Main article|Russian tea culture}}
[[File:Podstakannik and glass of tea.jpg|thumb|Glass of [[tea]] in a Kolchugino, a classic [[podstakannik|Soviet glass holder]], commemorating Soviet space exploration]]

The [[podstakannik]] ('подстаканник'), or tea glass holder (literally "thing under the glass"), is a part of Russian tea tradition. A Russian tea [[glass-holder]] is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, other CIS and ex-USSR countries. Expensive podstakanniks are made from [[silver]], classic series are made mostly from [[nickel silver]], [[cupronickel]], and other alloys with [[nickel]], [[silver]] or [[gold]] plating. In [[Russia]], it is customary to drink tea brewed separately in a teapot and diluted with freshly boiled water ('pair-of-teapots tea', 'чай парой чайников'). Traditionally, the tea is very strong, its strength often indicating the hosts' degree of hospitality. The traditional implement for boiling water for tea used to be the [[samovar]] (and sometimes it still is, though usually electric).  Tea is a family event, and is usually served after each meal with sugar (one to three teaspoonfuls per cup) and lemon (but without milk), and an assortment of jams, pastries and confections. Black tea is commonly used, with green tea gaining popularity as a more healthy, more "Oriental" alternative. Teabags are not used in the traditional Russian tea ceremony, only loose, large-leaf black tea.

In Russian prisons, where alcohol and drugs are prohibited, inmates often brew very strong tea known as '[[Chifir'|chifir]]', in order to experience its mood-altering properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyurem.net/mytext/how/023.htm|title=Чай, чифирь, купец|first=Виталий|last=Лозовский|date=|website=tyurem.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Western Europe==
[[File:Sign of L’Heure Gourmande.jpg|thumb|right|A sign for a ''Salon de Thé'' in the shape of a teapot in Paris]]

===France===
While [[France]] is well known for its coffee drinking, afternoon tea has long been a social habit of the upper middle class, famously illustrated, for example, by [[Marcel Proust]]'s novels. [[Mariage Frères]] is a famous high-end tea shop from Paris, active since 1854. The French tea market is still only a fraction of the British one (a consumption of 250&amp;nbsp;grams per person a year compared to about 2 kilos in the UK),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Le thé s'impose en France: une véritable révolution|work=AFP|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has doubled from 1995 to 2005 and is still growing steadily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pourquoi les sociétés de thé font fortune|author=Juthier, Jean-Etienne Juthier|work= JDN Economie|date= May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea in France is of the black variety, but Asian green teas and fruit-flavoured teas are becoming increasingly popular. French people generally drink tea in the afternoon. It is often taken in ''salons de thé''. Most people will add sugar to their tea (65%), then milk (25%), lemon (30%) or nothing (32%) are about equally popular.&lt;ref&gt;Apprenez à préparer le thé !, Louis Asana, Doctissimo, quoting Tea Expo 2004, Lipton&lt;/ref&gt; Tea is generally served with some pastries, including a variety of not so sweet ones reserved for tea drinking, like the ''[[madeleine (cake)|madeleine]]'' and the ''[[financier (pastry)|financier]]''.

===Ireland===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2016}}
[[File:The tea junction DSCF2110.jpg|thumb|right|An Irish café, ''The Tea Junction'' in [[Ballyvaughan]], [[County Clare]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]]]
[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] has, for a long time,{{when|date=April 2016}} been one of the biggest per capita consumers of tea in the world. Although broadly similar to tea culture in the United Kingdom, Irish tea culture has a number of distinguishing elements; for example, tea in Ireland is usually taken with milk or sugar and is slightly spicier and stronger than the traditional English Blend. Popular brands of tea sold in Ireland are [[J. Lyons and Co.|Lyons]], [[Barry's Tea|Barry's]], and [[Bewley's]].

===Portugal===
Tea growing in [[Portugal]] takes place in the [[Azores]], a group of islands located 1500&amp;nbsp;km west of Mainland Portugal. Portugal was the first to introduce the practice of drinking tea to Europe as well as the first European country to produce tea. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

In 1750, terrains ranging from the fields of [[Capelas]] to those of [[Porto Formoso]] on the island of [[São Miguel Island|São Miguel]] were used for the first trial crops of tea. They delivered 10&amp;nbsp;kg of black tea and 8&amp;nbsp;kg of green tea. A century later, with the introduction of skilled workers from the [[Macau]] Region of China in 1883, production became significant and the culture expanded. Following the instructions of these workers, the species ''[[Jasmine|Jasminum grandiflorum]]'' and ''[[Malva|Malva vacciones]]'' were introduced to give 'nobility' to the tea aroma, though only the Jasminum was used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorreana.com/historiae.htm|title=Azorentee  -  Chá Gorreana – Europas einzigartiger Tee von den Azoren|author=|date=|website=www.gorreana.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This tea is currently traded under the name of the processed compound, ''Gorreana'', and is produced by independent families. No [[herbicides]] or [[pesticides]] are allowed in the growing process, and modern consumers associate the production with more recent [[Organic food|organic]] teas. However, production standards concerning the plant itself and its cropping have not changed for the last 250 years.

===United Kingdom===
{{main article|Tea in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Milk clouds in tea.jpeg|thumb|right|Black tea with just added—and not yet stirred in—milk]]

The British are one of the [[List of countries by tea consumption per capita|largest tea consumers]] in the world, with each person consuming on average 1.9&amp;nbsp;kg per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html → Download → Food Supply → Crops Primary Equivalent&lt;/ref&gt; Tea is usually [[black tea]] served with milk and sometimes with sugar. Strong tea served with lots of milk and often two [[teaspoon]]s of sugar, usually in a mug, is commonly referred to as ''[[builder's tea]]'' for its association with builders and more broadly with the working class. Much of the time in the United Kingdom, tea drinking is not the delicate, refined cultural expression that the rest of the world imagines—a cup (or commonly a mug) of tea is something drunk frequently throughout the day. This is not to say that the British do not have a more formal tea ceremony, but [[tea break]]s are an essential part of the working day. The term is often shortened to 'tea', essentially indicating a break. This term was exported to the game of [[cricket (game)|cricket]] and consequently to most other countries of the former British Empire.

====History====
[[File:Tea box hg.jpg|thumb|left|Box for the storage of loose tea leaves known as a [[tea caddy]]]]
The popularity of tea dates back to the 19th century when [[British India|India was part of the British Empire]], and British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. It was, however, first introduced in the UK by the Portuguese [[Catherine of Braganza]], queen consort of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in the 1660s and 1670s. As tea spread throughout the United Kingdom and through the social classes, [[tea garden]]s and [[tea dance]]s developed. These would include watching fireworks or a dinner party and dance, concluding with an evening tea. The tea gardens lost value after [[World War II]] but tea dances are still held today in the UK.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Some scholars suggest that tea played a role in the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Afternoon tea possibly became a way to increase the number of hours labourers could work in factories; the stimulants in the tea, accompanied by sugary snacks, would give workers energy to finish out the day's work. Further, tea helped alleviate some of the consequences of the [[urbanisation]] that accompanied the industrial revolution: drinking tea required boiling one's water, thereby killing water-borne diseases like [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], and [[typhoid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanmacfarlane.com/savage/tea.html|title=Tea and the Industrial Revolution|author=|date=|website=www.alanmacfarlane.com|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tea as a meal====
[[File:Mt. Lavinia- Governor's High Tea.jpg|thumb|An example of a full afternoon tea service.]]
{{Main article|Tea (meal)}}
In the United Kingdom ''tea'' is not only the name of the beverage, but also the name of a meal. The kind of meal that a person means depends very much on their social background and where they live.  The differentiation in usage between dinner, supper, lunch and tea is one of the classic social markers of [[British English]] (see [[U and non-U English]]) and is discussed more fully [[Tea (meal)#Tea as the evening meal|at the article on tea as a meal]]. Briefly, afternoon tea (one example of which is the [[cream tea]]) is sweeter and earlier, while the high tea is the final meal of the day.

====Commonwealth countries====
Afternoon tea and its variants are the best known "tea ceremony" in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, available in homes and commercial establishments. In some [[List of dialects of the English language|varieties of English]], "tea" refers to a savoury meal, see [[Tea (meal)#Australian usages of the term|Australian usages of the term]]. Taiwanese [[bubble tea]], known locally as pearl milk tea, has become widely popular in urban Australia, with multiple chains in every major city.


==North America==
===Canada===
In Canada, various types of tea are used by many different indigenous tribes as healing and ceremonial medicines. For example, [[Ojibwe]] and [[Cree]] tribes in Ontario use Cedar Tea during [[sweat lodge]] ceremonies to cleanse and nourish their bodies. When European settlers arrived on North American shores, it was the indigenous people that taught them to make [[Pine#Biomedical|pine needle tea]] to help cure their [[scurvy]]; pine needles are a great source of [[vitamin C]].

===United States===
{{Main article|American tea culture}}
{{See also|Tea production in the United States}}
[[File:Iced Tea from flickr.jpg|thumb|Iced tea is popular in the United States]]

In the United States, tea can typically be served at all meals as an alternative to [[coffee]], when served hot, or [[soft drink]]s, when served iced. Tea is also consumed throughout the day as a beverage. [[Afternoon tea]], the meal done in the English tradition, is rarely served in the [[United States]], although it remains romanticized by small children; it is usually reserved for special occasions like [[Tea party (social gathering)|tea parties]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Rather than drinking tea hot, many Americans prefer tea served with ice. In fact, in the United States, about 80% of the tea consumed is served cold, or "iced".{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} [[Iced tea]] has become an iconic symbol of the [[Southern United States]] and [[Southern hospitality]], often appearing alongside summer barbecue cooking or grilled foods.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Iced tea is often made as [[sweet tea]], which is simply iced tea with copious amounts of sugar or sweetener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://whatscookingamerica.net/History/IcedTeaHistory.htm|title=History of Iced Tea and Sweet Tea, Whats Cooking America|first=Linda|last=Stradley|date=14 May 2015|website=whatscookingamerica.net|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iced tea can be purchased like soda, in canned or bottled form at vending machines and convenience stores. This pre-made tea is usually sweetened. Sometimes some other flavorings, such as lemon or raspberry, are added. Many restaurants dispense iced tea brewed throughout the day from upright containers.  {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

[[Decaffeination|Decaffeinated]] tea is widely available in the United States, for those who wish to reduce the physiological effects of [[caffeine]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

Before [[World War II]], the US preference for tea was equally split between [[green tea]] and [[black tea]], 40% and 40%, with the remaining 20% preferring [[oolong tea]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The war cut off the United States from its primary sources of green tea, [[China]] and [[Japan]], leaving it with tea almost exclusively from British-controlled [[India]], which produced black tea. After the war, nearly 99% of tea consumed was black tea. ''Green'', ''oolong'', and ''white'' teas have recently{{when|date=March 2010}} become more popular again, and are often touted as [[health food]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

In the past 15 years{{when|date=March 2010}} fast food coffee chains have made a huge impact on how Americans are exposed to herbal and exotic teas. Once considered a rarity, ''[[Tea|chai]]'', based on Indian ''[[masala chai]]'', has actually become a popular option for people who might drink a caffè [[latte]]. Although not as commercialized, Taiwanese-style [[Bubble tea]] has also become popular in the United States in recent years,{{when|date=March 2010}} often served in small local cafes in the same style as many coffee drinks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==South America==
===Brazil===
{{Main article|Brazilian tea culture}}
Brazilian tea culture has its origins with the [[infusion|infused beverages]], or ''chás'' ({{IPA-pt|ˈʃas}}), made by the indigenous cultures of the Amazon region. It has evolved since the Portuguese colonial period to include imported varieties and tea-drinking customs. There is a folk knowledge in Brazil which says that Brazilians, mainly the urban ones, have a greater taste for using [[sugar]] in teas than in other cultures due to the lack of habit to unsweetened drinks.

'''Turkish art''' refers to all works of [[visual art]] originating from the geographical area of what is present day [[Turkey]] since the arrival of the [[Turkish people|Turks]] in the Middle Ages.  Turkey also was the home of much significant art produced by earlier cultures, including the [[Hittites]], [[Ancient Greeks]], and [[Byzantine art|Byzantines]].  '''Ottoman art''' is therefore to the dominant element of Turkish art before the 20th century, although the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]] and other [[Turkic migration|earlier Turks]] also contributed.  The 16th and 17th centuries are generally recognized as the finest period for art in the [[Ottoman Empire]], much of it associated with the huge Imperial court.  In particular the long reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] from 1520–1566 brought a combination, rare in any ruling dynasty, of political and military success with strong encouragement of the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 12; Rogers and Ward, throughout, especially 26-41&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''nakkashane'', as the palace workshops are now generally known, were evidently very important and productive, but though there is a fair amount of surviving documentation, much remains unclear about how they operated.  They operated over many different media, but apparently not including pottery or textiles, with the craftsmen or artists apparently a mixture of slaves, especially Persians, captured in war (at least in the early periods), trained Turks, and foreign specialists. They were not necessarily physically located in the palace, and may have been able to undertake work for other clients as well as the sultan.  Many specialities were passed from father to son.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 120-124; 186-188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art media==
{{Culture of Turkey}}
[[Ottoman architecture]] developed traditional [[Islamic architecture|Islamic styles]], with some technical influences from Europe, into a highly sophisticated style, with interiors richly decorated in coloured tiles, seen in palaces, mosques and [[Türbe|turbe]] mausolea.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

Other forms of art represented developments of earlier [[Islamic art]], especially [[Persian art|those of Persia]], but with a distinct Turkish character. As in Persia, [[Chinese porcelain]] was avidly collected by the Ottoman court, and represented another important influence, mainly on decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, 54, 60; Rogers and Ward, 29, 186; Rawson, 183-191, and see index&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ottoman miniature]] and [[Ottoman illumination]] cover the figurative and non-figurative elements of the decoration of manuscripts, which tend to be treated as distinct genres, though often united in the same manuscript and page.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, see index; Rogers and Ward, 59-119&lt;/ref&gt;

The reign of the Ottomans in the 16th and early 17th centuries introduced the Turkish form of [[Islamic calligraphy]]. This art form reached the height of its popularity during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1520&amp;ndash;66).&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 55-74&lt;/ref&gt;  As decorative as it was communicative, [[Diwani]] was distinguished by the complexity of the line within the letter and the close juxtaposition of the letters within the word. The [[hilya]] is an illuminated sheet with Islamic calligraphy of a description of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].  The [[tughra]] is an elaborately stylized formal signature of the sultan, which like the hilya performed some of the functions of portraits in Christian Europe.  Bookcovers were also elaborately decorated.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, see index; Rogers and Ward, 26-41, 62-64 on tughra&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important media were in the applied or [[decorative arts]] rather than figurative work.  Pottery, especially [[İznik pottery]], jewellery, [[hardstone carving]]s, [[Turkish carpet]]s, woven and embroidered silk textiles were all produced to extremely high standards, and carpets in particular were exported widely.  Other Turkish art ranges from metalwork, carved woodwork and furniture with elaborate inlays to traditional ''Ebru'' or [[paper marbling]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogers and Ward, 120-215, cover a wide range; Levey, 51-55, and see index&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later periods==
In the 18th and 19th centuries Turkish art and architecture became more heavily influenced by contemporary European styles, leading to over-elaborated and fussy detail in decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Levey, chapters 5 and 6&lt;/ref&gt;  European-style painting was slow to be adopted, with [[Osman Hamdi Bey]] (1842-1910) for long a somewhat solitary figure. He was a member of the Ottoman administrative elite who trained in Paris, and painted throughout his long career as a senior administrator and curator in Turkey. Many of his works represent [[Orientalism]] from the inside, as it were.

A transition from Islamic artistic traditions under the Ottoman Empire to a more secular, Western orientation has taken place in Turkey. [[History of Modern Turkish painting|Modern Turkish painters]] are striving to find their own art forms, free from Western influence. Sculpture is less developed, and public monuments are usually heroic representations of [[Atatürk]] and events from the war of independence. Literature is considered the most advanced of contemporary Turkish arts.

'''''Vapor Trail: Hyper Offense Formation''''', known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Kuuga – Operation Code Vapor Trail'''''|空牙 – Operation Code Vapor Trail}} and usually simply referred to as '''''Vapor Trail''''', is a [[1989 in video gaming|1989]] [[shoot 'em up]] [[arcade game]] developed and published by [[Data East]]. ''Vapor Trail'' was followed by ''[[Rohga: Armor Force]]'' and ''[[Skull Fang]]''.

==Plot==
In 1999, a terrorist organization known only as DAGGER has occupied the city of [[New York City|New York]] where they have hacked into military defenses world-wide, established their own military command and gained access to nuclear missile silos. They hold the world hostage in this position and promise to cancel their threats of destroying the Earth only until the world's governments relinquish their power to DAGGER.

A Special Forces Air Unit is called in to attack DAGGER and cripple their strongest defenses and headquarters in New York. Until then, the city remains silent. The organization name was actually changed from the Japanese original [[Ragnarok]].

==Gameplay==
The game features 2 players controlling the jet fighters simultaneously for battle across numerous levels. There are 3 types of jets varying from different classes of speeds and firepower.  The Silph is the midrange plane with the most balance.  While the Valkyrie carries the most firepower, and the Seylen jet is capable of flying at the highest mach speed.  Weapon upgrades are available throughout the game, ranging from homing missiles, ring guns, flame throwers and many more.  Each jet may also activate the shield manually in times of trouble.

===Weapons===
Players have a choice between four different standard pick-up weapons:
Vulcan – the player's default weapon which fires straight forward, but can flare out to destroy larger groups of enemies depending on the jet selected.
Bombs – a straight firing, explosive weapon that retains the same firing pattern for all jets, but increases in launch count (number of times it can be fired at once) when upgraded.
Defender – an explosive cluster-shot weapon that encircles the player's jet and remains the same when upgraded, but increases in count much like the Bombs.
Missiles – homing missiles that fire from multiple directions of the jet. Similar to the Vulcan, the Missiles fire in different directions depending on the jet that is used.

Every jet is equipped with a roll device that allows them to [[kamikaze]] safely into other jets. The roll must be re-charged after every use. Players also have the choice to pick up the S-Unit, a weapon attachment that empowers the jet's firing no matter what weapon is picked-up previously and every jet's S-Unit attack differs from the others. Once the S-Unit is equipped, the player cannot use their previous weapons unless the S-Unit is detonated. Detonating the S-Unit does not harm the player, but it does harm the enemy as the unit will detonate in a large and powerful explosion.

==Mega Drive/Genesis release==
''Vapor Trail'' was ported in-house by Data East to the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] in 1991. This version was published in Japan by [[Telenet Japan]] (under the Riot label) and in the United States by its subsidiary [[Renovation Products]]. The port was very accurate to the arcade counterpart despite much stricter hardware and color limitations. Even the display ratio was maintained during conversion with the addition of the side bars. This port was also featured on the game show [[Nick Arcade (game show)|Nick Arcade]], in the Video Challenge portion of the show. Sound effects from the game were sampled in the [[Snazin Smith]] song "[[Doctor Rhino]]".

==Reception==
The game was reviewed in 1992 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #178 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name="Dragon178"&gt;{{cite journal

A '''''Vorlage''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfoːɐ̯laːɡə|}}; from the [[German language|German]] for ''prototype'' or ''template'') is a prior version or manifestation of a text under consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Online: vorlage, n.
Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. &lt;[http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679 http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/224679]&gt;; accessed 14 January 2012. First published in A Supplement to the OED IV, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  It may refer to such a version of a text itself, a particular [[manuscript]] of the text, or a more complex manifestation of the text (e.g., a group of copies, or a group of excerpts).&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Jonathan D. H., ''Contours in the Text'' (T&amp;T Clark International, 2011), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the original-language version of a text which a translator then works into a [[translation]] is called the ''Vorlage'' of that translation.&lt;ref&gt;Freedman &amp; Kuhlken, ''What are the Dead Sea scrolls and why do they matter?'' (Eerdmans, 2007), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Luther Bible]] is a translation of the [[Textus Receptus]]. So in this case the Textus Receptus is the ''Vorlage'' of the Luther Bible.  

Sometimes the ''Vorlage'' of a translation may be lost to history.  In some of these cases the ''Vorlage'' may be reconstructed from the translation.  Such a reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may be called a ''retroversion'', and it invariably is made with some amount of uncertainty.  Nevertheless, the ''Vorlage'' may still be reconstructed in some parts at such a level of confidence that the translation and its retroversion can be used as a witness for the purposes of [[textual criticism]].  This reconstructed ''Vorlage'' may stand on its own as the sole witness of the original-language text, or it may be compared and used along with other witnesses.  Thus, for example, scholars use the reconstructed ''Vorlage'' of the Greek [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] at parts to correct the Hebrew [[Masoretic text|Masoretic]] version when trying to determine oldest version of the Hebrew Bible that they can infer.&lt;ref&gt;Albrektson, B., "Masoretic or Mixed" in ''Text, Translation, Theology'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2010), p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, as another example, the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] fragments of Plato's [[Republic (dialogue)|Republic]] included among the [[Nag Hammadi library]] are used to help attest to the original Greek text which Plato himself wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Slings, S. R., ''Platonis Rempublicam'' (Oxford University Press, 2003), xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the bulk of the [[Gospel of Thomas]], the ''Vorlage'' exists only as a retroversion of the Coptic translation, as no other witness to the original Greek text for most of the sayings recorded therein is known.&lt;ref&gt;Plisch, Uwe-Karsten ''Das Thomasevangelium, Originaltext mit Kommentar''. (Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6130">In [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of [[analytical psychology]], the '''Wise Old Woman and the [[Wise Old Man]]''' are [[archetypes]] of the [[Collective Unconscious]]. 'The "wise old woman"...[or] helpful "old woman" is a well-known symbol in myths and fairy tales for the wisdom of the eternal female nature'.&lt;ref&gt;Jolande Jacobi, "Symbols in an Individual Analysis" in C. G . Jung ed., ''Man and his Symbols'' (London 1978) p. 331 and p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; The 'Wise Old Man, or some other very powerful aspect of eternal masculinity'&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hannah, ''Striving towards Wholeness'' (Boston 1988) p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; is her male counterpart.

==Individuation==

In Jung's thought, the [[individuation]] process was marked by a sequence of archetypes, each acquiring predominance at successive stages, and so reflecting what he termed an ascending psychic scale or 'hierarchy of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Two Essays on Analytical Psychology'' (London 1953) p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, starting with the intermediate position of '[[Anima and animus|anima or animus]]...just as the latter have a higher position in the hierarchy than the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]], so wholeness lays claim to a position and a value superior'&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Aion'' (London 1959) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; still. The Wise Old Woman and Man, as what he termed "[[Mana]]" personalities or "supraordinate" personalities, stood for that wholeness of the self: 'the ''mother'' ("Primordial Mother" and "[[Earth Mother]]") as a supraordinary personality...as the "self"'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious'' (London 1996) p. 183 and p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Marie-Louise von Franz|von Franz]] put it, 'If an individual has wrestled seriously and long enough with the anima (or animus) problem, so that he, or she, is no longer partially identified with it, the unconscious again changes its dominant character and appears in a new symbolic form representing the Self, the innermost nucleus of the personality. In the dreams of a woman this centre is usually personified as a superior female figure – a priestess, sorceress, earth mother, or goddess of nature or love. In the case of a man, it manifests itself as a masculine initiator and guardian (an Indian ''[[guru]]''), a wise old man, a spirit of nature and so forth'.&lt;ref&gt;M.-L. von Franz, "The Process of Individuation", in C. G. Jung ed., ''Symbols'' p. 207–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculine initiator was described by Jung as 'a figure of the same sex corresponding to the father-imago...the mana-personality [a]s a dominant of the collective unconscious, the recognized archetype of the mighty man in the form of hero, chief, magician, medicine-man, saint, the ruler of men and spirits'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 226-7&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, 'the wise Old Woman figure represented by [[Hecate]] or the [[Crone]] ...the Great Mother'&lt;ref&gt;Claire Douglas, ''The Old Woman's Daughter'' (Texas 2006) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; stood for an aspect of the mother-imago. The archetypes of the collective unconscious can thus be seen as inner representations of the same-sex parent – as an 'imago built up from parental influences plus the specific reactions of the child'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Two Essays'' p. 184-5&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, for the Jungian, 'the making conscious of those contents which constitute the archetype of the mana personality signifies therefore "for the man the second and true liberation from the father, for the woman that from the mother, and therewith the first perception of their own unique individuality"'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, quoted in Jolande Jacobi, ''The Psychology of C. G. Jung: An Introduction'' (London 1946) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mana attributes: positive and negative==

In Jung's view, 'all archetypes spontaneously develop favourable and unfavourable, light and dark, good and bad effects'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Thus 'the "good Wise Man" must here be contrasted with a correspondingly dark, chthonic figure',&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Aion'' p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same way, the priestess or sibyl has her counterpart in the figure of 'the witch...called by Jung the "terrible mother"'.&lt;ref&gt;Northrop Frye, ''Anatomy of Criticism'' (Princeton 1971) p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, male and female, 'The hunter or old magician and the witch correspond to the negative parental images in the magic world of the unconscious'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; 

But judgement of such collective archetypes must not be hasty. 'Just as all archetypes have a positive, favourable, bright side that points upwards, so also they have one that points downwards, partly negative and unfavourable, partly chthonic' – so that (for example) 'the sky-woman is the positive, the bear the negative aspect of the "supraordinate personality", which extends the conscious human being upwards into the celestial and downwards into the animal regions'.&lt;ref&gt;Jung, ''Archetypes'' p. 226 and p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Yet both aspects, celestial and chthonic, were (at least potentially) of equal value for Jung, as he sought for what he termed a "coniunctio oppositorum", a union of opposites.  'One does not become enlightened by imagining figures of light', he argued, 'but by making the darkness conscious'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''[[Alchemical Studies]]'' (London 1978) p. 265-6&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly with respect to the goal of the individuation process itself, 'as a totality, the self is a coincidentia oppositorum; it is therefore bright and dark and yet neither'.&lt;ref&gt;C. G. Jung, ''Mysterium Coniunctionis'' (London 1963) p. 108n&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming to terms with the Mana figures of the collective unconscious – with the parental imagos – thus meant overcoming a psychic [[splitting (psychology)|splitting]], so as to make possible an acceptance of 'the Twisted side of the Great Mother'; an acceptance of the way 'the father contains both Kings at once...the Twisted King and the Whole King'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bly, ''Iron John'' (Dorset 1991) p. 115 and p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;
