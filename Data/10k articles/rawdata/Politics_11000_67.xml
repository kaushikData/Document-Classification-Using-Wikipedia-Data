      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3471">The '''6521 Project,''' sometimes called the "6521 Group," was the moniker given to a nationwide operation initiated by the [[Communist Party of China]] in 2009 to ensure “social stability” by cracking down on potential dissidents during anniversaries of political significance. The digits in the campaign’s name are a reference to the 60th anniversary of the founding of the [[People’s Republic of China]], the 50th anniversary of the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], the 20th anniversary of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests]], and the 10th anniversary of the [[persecution of Falun Gong]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wines. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/world/asia/11china.html "Anniversaries for Tibet and Tiananmen Square Have China on Edge"]. The New York Times, 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 6521 Project was initiated as a top-level committee by the Communist Party, and was reportedly headed by [[Xi Jinping]], current [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wines. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/10/world/asia/10china.html 'China's Leaders See a Calendar Full of Anniversaries, and Trouble']. The New York Times, 9 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the campaign, all provinces and municipalities were required to establish temporary 6521 taskforces under the local Communist Party and Public Security leadership. Authorities at the township and county levels were also required to implement the 6521 project, reporting on their progress to municipal or provincial taskforces above them.&lt;ref&gt;Cary Huang, ‘‘Taskforces Set Up To Keep Lid on Protests,’’ South China Morning Post, 28 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Executive Commission on China. [http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt09/CECCannRpt2009.pdf "2009 Annual Report"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091103235417/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/annualRpt/annualRpt09/CECCannRpt2009.pdf |date=2009-11-03 }}, 10 Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel to the 6521 Project, a top-level coordinating body was created under the direction of [[Zhou Yongkang]], called the "Central Committee for Comprehensive Management of Social Order." The committee identified a series of potential threats to social order, and prescribed measures to suppress them. The threats named included ethnic separatism in Tibet, Falun Gong, protests triggered by unemployment, land grabs, tainted products and labor disputes, crime, and the illicit installation of satellite receivers and illegal publishing. The Committee set out 33 measures to ensure social stability. It also revived a network of volunteer informants in schools and neighborhoods, and established a joint responsibility system that holds heads of households, work units, and local governments accountable in the event of protests or other destabilizing events.&lt;ref&gt;Ching Cheong.

{{Politics of Sweden}}
'''The Alliance''' ({{lang-sv|Alliansen}}), formerly the '''Alliance for Sweden''' (''Allians för Sverige''), is a [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[liberal conservative]] [[political alliance]] in [[Sweden]].

The Alliance consists of the four centre-right [[list of political parties in Sweden|political parties]] in the [[Riksdag]]. The Alliance was formed while in [[opposition (parliamentary)|opposition]], and later achieved a majority government in the [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 general election]] and a minority government in the [[Swedish general election, 2010|2010 general election]], governing Sweden from 2006 to 2014 with [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] of the [[Moderate Party]] serving as [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] until the [[Swedish general election, 2014|2014 general election]]. The Alliance is co-chaired by every component party's individual leaders.

After [[Swedish general election, 2014|defeat in 2014]], the [[Moderate Party]]'s [[parliamentary group leader]] [[Anna Kinberg Batra]] announced to the [[Riksdag]] that the [[political alliance]] now "will operate in opposition".

As a result of the [[Swedish general election, 2018|2018 general election]], the future of the Alliance is uncertain. In November, the Centre Party and the Liberals opposed Ulf Kristersson's proposed government coalition composed of the Moderates and the Christian Democrats. Kristersson was supported by three parties; his own Moderate Party, the Christian Democrats and the Sweden Democrats. The Centre Party and Liberals opposed the idea of such a coalition, as they are against any government that depends on the Sweden Democrats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dn.se/nyheter/politik/kristersson-en-tung-dag-for-alliansen/|title=Kristersson: ”En tung dag för Alliansen”|last=Mannheimer|first=Edgar|date=13 November 2018|work=Dagens Nyheter|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The '''[[Health Care Party]] of Dalarna''' led by [[Ingvar Niilimaa]], a [[Single-issue politics|single-issue party]] which only active in [[Dalarna County]] where it become part of a DSP-Alliance-MP government since 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historiskt maktskifte i Dalarna – Alliansen tar över efter 92 år|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/dalarna/historiskt-maktskifte-i-dalarna-alliansen-tar-over-efter-92-ar|newspaper=SVT Nyheter|date=2018-10-11|accessdate=2018-10-26|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nya namnet: Dalasamverkan|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/dalarna/nya-namnet-dalasamverkan|newspaper=SVT Nyheter|date=2018-10-11|accessdate=2018-10-26|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The '''[[New Democracy (Sweden)|New Democracy]]''' led by [[Ian Wachtmeister]] and [[Bert Karlsson]], a [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populist party]] which support the centre-right government 1991 to 1994. The party dissolved 2000.

== History of the Alliance ==
[[Politics of Sweden|Swedish politics]] had been dominated by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]] for over 70 years. They had been in [[government]] for all but nine years (summer of 1936, 1976&amp;ndash;1982, 1991&amp;ndash;1994) since 1932. The opposition parties decided that this was partly because they did not present a clear and viable alternative government. At a meeting held in the Centre Party leader Maud Olofsson's home in the village of [[Högfors (village)|Högfors]], the four party leaders decided to form an alliance. The meeting ended on 31 August 2004 with the presentation of a joint declaration outlining the principles under which the four parties intended to fight the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Allians för Sverige |publisher=Allians för Sverige |date=31 August 2004 |url=http://www.alliansforsverige.se/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/hogfors.pdf |language=Swedish |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later a similar meeting was held at Christian Democrat leader Göran Hägglund's home in [[Bankeryd]], resulting in the affirmation of the alliance and another declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Program för arbete |publisher=Allians för Sverige |date=31 August 2005 |url=http://www.alliansforsverige.se/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/bankeryd1.pdf |language=Swedish |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims and policies of the Alliance ==

[[File:Alliansen 2010.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The Alliance the day before the 2010 election. From left to right: Hägglund, Björklund, Olofsson and Reinfeldt]]
The Centre-right Alliance for Sweden aimed to win a [[majority]] of seats in the [[Swedish general election, 2006|2006 Riksdag elections]] and form a [[coalition government]].

In order to do this, the member parties decided to issue common [[policy]] statements and to have a joint election manifesto. Each individual party still had its own manifesto and policies, but these will build up from common proposals in the Alliance's joint proposals. The Alliance has policy working groups for six areas: [[economic policy]], [[education policy]], [[foreign policy]], the [[welfare state]], [[employment]] and [[business]] policy, and [[policing]]. These were not set according to party size, but with one senior politician (often MP) and one staff per party, and following the idea that "everybody contributes and everybody gains".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ännu fler ministrar|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/valet2010/article12554110.ab|website=Aftonbladet|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of this policy cooperation was the [[budget]] proposal that the Alliance parties put forward on 2 October 2005. The core proposal was a tax cut of 49 billion [[Swedish kronor]], which is 1.9% of [[GDP]] and 3.3% of the total income of the [[public sector]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=En tunn agenda för reformer |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=4 October 2005 |url=http://www.dn.se/ledare/huvudledare/en-tunn-agenda-for-reformer-1.394779 |language=Swedish |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each individual party also proposed its own policies in addition. For example, the Liberals want to spend 1bn kronor extra on tertiary education and the Christian Democrats want to have more benefits and tax deductions for families.

On 14 June 2006 Alliance for Sweden agreed on a common energy policy. It will apply over the next parliamentary term (2006–2010), and includes a promise not to shut down any more [[nuclear reactor]]s during that period ([[Barsebäck nuclear power plant|Barsebäck 2]] was shut down in 2005). The proposal is that no more reactors are to be built, that the nuclear phase-out law will be repealed and that all forms of energy research will be legal and able to receive state grants (research on [[nuclear power]] is currently forbidden in Sweden). An Alliance government would also grant any applications to increase the output of the existing plants, provided that it would be safe to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alliance agrees to keep nuclear |first=Adam |last=Ewing |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=14 June 2006 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=4068&amp;date=20060614 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605043735/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=4068&amp;date=20060614 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been hailed as a historic step, as disagreement over nuclear power has long plagued the centre-right in Sweden: the Centre Party opposes nuclear power, the Moderates and Christian Democrats support its continuing operation while the Liberals want to build more reactors. Some doubts have been raised about the long-term survival of this compromise, as neither the Centre Party nor the Liberals have changed their fundamental positions on nuclear power.

On 5 July 2006, during the politics week at [[Almedalen]] on [[Gotland]], the Alliance parties announced a plan to abolish [[property tax]]. Their agreement promises to freeze taxable values at the current level (so that the revaluation that is being carried out will not apply), and to reduce the rate of tax on apartments from 0.5% to 0.4% of their taxable value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Alliance to abolish property tax |first=Adam |last=Ewing |newspaper=[[The Local]] |date=4 July 2006 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=4249&amp;date=20060704 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605044009/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=4249&amp;date=20060704 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A ceiling of 5000 [[Swedish kronor|kronor]] will also be imposed on the taxation of the value of a house's plot. The parties are also agreed on the abolition of the tax and its replacement with a municipal charge independent of the value of the property; this reform is planned to be carried out in 2008. Property tax is estimated to bring in 28.1 billion kronor in 2006, rising to 30.2bn in 2007 and 32.2bn in 2008 (as taxable values rise). The first stage of the Alliance's plan (freezing property values, capping the tax on land value and reducing the rate for apartments) is estimated to cost around 4-5 billion kronor. The financing of this is to be revealed in the Alliance's [[manifesto]] in August 2006.

Alliance for Sweden released its election manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fler i arbete – mer att dela på |publisher=Allians för Sverige |date=23 August 2006 |url=http://www.alliansforsverige.se/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/valmanifest2006.pdf |language=Swedish |accessdate=19 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411091041/http://www.alliansforsverige.se/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/Valmanifest2006.pdf| archivedate=April 11, 2009&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''More people at work - more to share'' ({{lang-sv|Fler i arbete - mer att dela på}}), on 23 August 2006.

The result of the election was clear enough on election night for [[Moderate Party]] leader [[Fredrik Reinfeldt]] to declare himself the victor and for [[Göran Persson]] to announce his resignation as [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] and as leader of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]]. The four [[centre-right]] parties of Alliance for Sweden formed a government with Fredrik Reinfeldt as Prime Minister, which was presented to the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] on 6 October.

== The Alliance government (2006-2014) ==
{{See also|Cabinet of Fredrik Reinfeldt|Government of Sweden}}
[[Minister for Finance (Sweden)|Minister for Finance]] [[Anders Borg]] presented the government's first budget&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Autumn Budget Bill: Putting Sweden to work - a good deal for all |publisher=[[Ministry of Finance (Sweden)|Ministry of Finance]] |date=16 October 2006 |url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/sb/d/7341/a/71054;jsessionid=aXEoxDjfj4h- |accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 October 2006. The budget contains many of the proposals that were prominent in the Alliance's election campaign: both the job deduction in the income tax, which will also be larger for old people to encourage them to remain in the labour market, and the "fresh start jobs" with reduced payroll tax for companies employing people who have been unemployed for more than a year will come into effect from 1 January 2007. Tax reductions for companies hiring young people and for domestic services are to come into effect on 1 July. The tax reductions announced in the budget total 42 billion [[Swedish kronor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Swedish tax slashed by 42 billion kronor |first=Paul |last=O'Mahony |newspaper=[[The Local]] |agency=[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå]] |date=16 October 2006 |url=http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5229&amp;date=20061016 |accessdate=19 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605054251/http://www.thelocal.se/article.php?ID=5229&amp;date=20061016 |archivedate=5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of which the income tax deduction is 38.7 billion. Other changes include the ending of employers' co-financing of sickness benefit after the second week, reduction of unemployment benefits and considerably raised fees to unemployment funds, resulting in a substantial decline in union density and density of unemployment funds.&lt;ref&gt;Anders Kjellberg (2011) [http://portal.research.lu.se/portal/files/3462138/2064087.pdf "The Decline in Swedish Union Density since 2007"] ''Nordic Journal of Working Life Studies'' (NJWLS) Vol. 1.

Benefit would be payable for a maximum of 300 days, or 450 if the recipient has children.

In 1991, the Alliance was called the Centre-Right Parties. They formed the centre-right minority coalition government in 1991 with the support of right-wing populist party  After the coalition had been lost in 1994, the Centre-Right Parties was dissolved but the centre-right opposition parties continued to work together. In 2004, the four parties Moderate Party, Centre Party, Liberal People's Party and the Christian Democrats wanted to collaborate again. So they started the Alliance. Alliance is a revival of the Centre-Right Parties.

{{race}}

The '''Aryan race''' is a [[Race (human classification)|racial grouping]] that emerged in the period of the late 19th century and mid-20th century to describe people of [[Indo-European]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/articles/devdutt-pattanaik-leveraging-the-aryans/17076154|title=Devdutt Pattanaik: Leveraging the Aryans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It derives from the idea that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|original speakers of the Indo-European languages]] and their descendants up to the present day constitute a distinctive [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or subrace of the [[Caucasian race]].&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster See original definition (definition #1) of "Aryan" in English--Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Aryan'' has generally been used to describe the [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language]] root *arya which was the ethnonym the [[Indo-Iranians]] adopted to describe Aryans. Its cognate in [[Sanskrit]] is the word ''[[ārya]]'' ([[Devanāgarī]]: [[आर्य]]), in origin an ethnic self-designation, in Classical Sanskrit meaning "honourable, respectable, noble".&lt;ref&gt;[[Monier-Williams]] (1899).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision)|publisher=UNIVERSITÄT ZU KÖLN |url=http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Old Persian]] cognate ''ariya-'' ([[Old Persian cuneiform]]: 𐎠𐎼𐎡𐎹) is the ancestor of the modern name of [[Iran]] and [[ethnonym]] for the [[Iranian people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/arya-an-ethnic-epithet |title=Arya |last=Bailey |first=H.W. |website=Encyclopædia Iranica |access-date=April 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the most ancient known [[Indo-European languages]] were those of the ancient Indo-Iranians. The word ''Aryan'' was therefore adopted to refer not only to the [[Indo-Iranian peoples]], but also to native Indo-European speakers as a whole, including the&lt;!--DO NOT ADD OR REMOVE FROM THIS LIST WITHOUT CITATIONS--&gt; [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Greek language|Greeks]], and the [[Germanic languages|Germans]]. It was soon recognised that [[Baltic languages|Balts]], [[Celtic languages|Celts]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavs]] also belonged to the same group. It was argued that all of these languages originated from a common root – now known as [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] – spoken by an ancient people who were thought of as ancestors of the [[Europe]]an, [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], and [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] peoples.

This usage was common among knowledgeable authors writing in the late 19th and early 20th century. An example of this usage appears in ''[[The Outline of History]]'', a bestselling 1920 work by [[H. G. Wells]].&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H.G. ''[[The Outline of History]]'', 3rd ed. (New York: Macmillan, 1921), Ch. 20 ("The Aryan-Speaking Peoples in Prehistoric Times"), pp. 236-51.&lt;/ref&gt; In that influential volume, Wells used the term in the plural ("the Aryan peoples"), but he was a staunch opponent of the racist and politically motivated exploitation of the singular term ("the Aryan people") by earlier authors like [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] (see below) and was careful either to avoid the generic singular, though he did refer now and again in the singular to some specific "Aryan people" (e.g., the [[Scythians]]). In 1922, in ''[[A Short History of the World (H.G. Wells)|A Short History of the World]]'', Wells depicted a highly diverse group of various "Aryan peoples" learning "methods of civilization" and then, by means of different uncoordinated movements that Wells believed were part of a larger dialectical rhythm of conflict between settled civilizations and nomadic invaders that also encompassed Aegean and Mongol peoples ''inter alia'', "subjugat[ing]" – "in form" but not in "ideas and methods" – "the whole ancient world, Semitic, Aegean and Egyptian alike".&lt;ref name="bartleby"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/86/19.html |title= H.G. Wells in 1922 on the early history of "the Aryan peoples" (Proto-Indo Europeans) |publisher=bartleby.com|accessdate=August 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in a climate of burgeoning racism it proved difficult to maintain such nuanced distinctions. Even [[Max Mueller]], a linguist who wrote in 1888 that "an ethnologist who speaks of Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar",&lt;ref&gt;F. Max Müller, ''Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas'' (1888), Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004, p. 120; Dorothy Matilda Figueira, ''Aryans, Jews, Brahmins: Theorizing Authority Through Myths of Identity'' (SUNY Press, 2002), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; was on occasion guilty of using the term "Aryan race".&lt;ref&gt;[[Romila Thapar]], "The Theory of Aryan Race and India: History and Politics," ''Social Scientist'' 24.1/3 (Jan.–Mar. 1996), 6. Thapar cites an 1883 lecture in which Mueller spoke of someone as "belonging to the south-eastern branch of the Aryan race."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1944 edition of [[Rand McNally]]'s ''World Atlas'', the Aryan race is depicted as one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rand McNally]] (1944) "Races of Mankind" (map)''Rand McNally's World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago: Rand McNally.   pp.278–79 – In the explanatory section below the map, the Aryan race (the word "Aryan" being defined in the description below the map as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans") is described as being one of the ten major racial groupings of mankind. Each of the ten racial groupings is depicted in a different [[color]] on the map and the estimated populations in 1944 of the larger racial groups except the Dravidians are given (the Dravidian population in 1944 would have been about 70,000,000). The other nine groups are depicted as being the [[Semitic people|Semitic race]] (the Aryans (850,000,000) and the Semites (70,000,000) are described as being the two main branches of the [[Caucasian race]]), the [[Dravidian race]], the [[Mongoloid race|Mongolian race]] (700,000,000), the [[Malayan race]] (Correct population given on page 413 – 64,000,000 including besides the populations of the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, and Madagascar also half of the Malay States, Micronesia, and Polynesia), the [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indian race]] (10,000,000), the [[Black people|Negro race]] (140,000,000), the [[Australoid race|Native Australians]], the [[Australoid race|Papuans]], and the [[Capoid race|Hottentots and Bushmen]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[science fiction]] author [[Poul Anderson]], an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] of [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry, in his many works, consistently used the term ''Aryan'' as a synonym for "Indo-Europeans".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the Poul Anderson short stories in the 1964 collection ''[[Time and Stars]]'' and the ''Polesotechnic League'' stories featuring [[Nicholas van Rijn]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "Aryan" as a synonym for Indo -European may occasionally appear in material that is based on historic scholarship. Thus, a 1989 article in ''[[Scientific American]]'', [[Colin Renfrew]] uses the term "Aryan" as a synonym for "Indo-European".&lt;ref&gt;Renfrew, Colin. (1989). The Origins of Indo-European Languages. /Scientific American/, 261(4), 82-90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] is still commonly used to describe the Indic half of the [[Indo-Iranian languages]], i.e., the family that includes [[Sanskrit]] and modern languages such as [[Hindi]]-[[Urdu]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] and [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortson, Benjamin W.

{{See also|Scientific racism}}

In the context of 19th-century [[physical anthropology]] and [[scientific racism]], the term "Aryan race" has been misapplied to all people descended from the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]] – a subgroup of the [[Europid]]or "[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]" race,&lt;ref&gt;Mish, Frederic C., Editor in Chief ''Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary'' Springfield, Massachusetts, U.S.A.:1994--Merriam-Webster Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]] ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=s9UKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Race Life of the Aryan Peoples]'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One--''The Old World'' Volume Two--''The New World'' ISBN B000859S6O&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the Indo-Iranians (who are the only people known to have used ''Arya'' as an [[endonym]] in ancient times). This usage was considered to include most modern inhabitants of [[Australasia]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Central Asia]], [[Europe]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Siberia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southern Africa]], and [[West Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Rand McNally’s World Atlas International Edition'' Chicago:1944 Rand McNally  Map: "Races of Mankind" pp. 278–279.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such claims became increasingly common during the early 19th century, when it was commonly believed that the Aryans originated in the south-west [[Eurasian steppe]]s (present-day [[Russia]] and [[Ukraine]]).

[[Max Müller]] is often identified as the first writer to mention an "Aryan race" in English. In his ''Lectures on the Science of Language'' (1861),&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt; Muller referred to Aryans as a "race of people". At the time, the term race had the meaning of "a group of tribes or peoples, an ethnic group".&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] under race, ''n.''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; I.1.c has "A group of several tribes or peoples, regarded as forming a distinct ethnic set. Esp. used in 19th-cent. anthropological classification, sometimes in conjunction with linguistic groupings."&lt;/ref&gt; Müller's concept of Aryan was later construed to imply a biologically distinct sub-group of humanity, by writers such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]], who argued that the Aryans represented a superior branch of humanity. Müller objected to the mixing of linguistics and anthropology. "The Science of Language and the Science of Man cannot be kept too much asunder&amp;nbsp;... I must repeat what I have said many times before, it would be wrong to speak of Aryan blood as of dolichocephalic grammar".&lt;ref&gt;Speech before the University of Stassbourg, 1872, Chaudhuri, Nirad, ''Scholar Extraordinary: The Life of Professor the Rt. Hon. Freidrich Max Muller'', Chatto and Windus, 1974, p.313&lt;/ref&gt; He restated his opposition to this method in 1888 in his essay ''Biographies of words and the home of the Aryas''.&lt;ref name=Orsucci&gt;Andrea Orsucci, "[http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html Ariani, indogermani, stirpi mediterranee: aspetti del dibattito sulle razze europee (1870-1914)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020310125529/http://www.unifi.it/riviste/cromohs/3_98/orsucci.html |date=2002-03-10 }}", in ''[[Cromohs]]'', 1998 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur de Gobineau.jpg|thumb|left|[[Arthur de Gobineau]], one of the key formulators of the theory of the "Aryan race"]]
By the late 19th century the steppe theory of Indo-European origins was challenged by a view that the Indo-Europeans originated in ancient Germany or [[Scandinavia]] – or at least that in those countries the original Indo-European ethnicity had been preserved. The word Aryan was consequently used even more restrictively – and even less in keeping with its Indo-Iranian origins – to mean "[[Germanic people|Germanic]]", "Nordic" or [[Northern Europe]]ans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)|first=Georges|year=1899|title=Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume=5|issue=3|pages=329–346|doi=10.1086/210895}}&lt;/ref&gt; This implied division of Caucasoids into Aryans, [[Semites]] and [[Hamites]] was also based on linguistics, rather than based on physical anthropology; it paralleled an archaic tripartite division in anthropology between "[[Nordic race|Nordic]]", "[[Alpine race|Alpine]]" and "[[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]]" races.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

A number of later writers, such as the French anthropologist [[Vacher de Lapouge]] in his book ''L'Aryen'', argued that this superior branch could be identified biologically by using the [[cephalic index]] (a measure of head shape) and other indicators. He argued that the long-headed "[[Dolichocephaly|dolichocephalic]]-blond" Europeans, characteristically found in northern Europe, were natural leaders, destined to rule over more "[[Brachycephaly|brachiocephalic]]" (short headed) peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/210895|last=Vacher de Lapouge (trans Clossen, C)|first=Georges |title=Old and New Aspects of the Aryan Question|journal=The American Journal of Sociology|volume= 5| issue = 3|pages=329–346|year=1899}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German origin of the Aryans was especially promoted by the archaeologist [[Gustaf Kossinna]], who claimed that the Proto-Indo-European peoples were identical to the [[Corded Ware culture]] of Neolithic Germany. This idea was widely circulated in both intellectual and popular culture by the early twentieth century,&lt;ref&gt;Arvidsson, Stefan (2006). Aryan Idols. USA: University of Chicago Press, 143. {{ISBN|0-226-02860-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected in the concept of "[[Corded-Nordics]]" in [[Carleton S. Coon]]'s 1939 ''[[The Races of Europe (1939 book)|The Races of Europe]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

Other anthropologists contested such claims. In Germany, [[Rudolf Virchow]] launched a study of [[craniometry]], which prompted him to denounce "Nordic mysticism" in the 1885 Anthropology Congress in [[Karlsruhe]], while [[Josef Kollmann]]&lt;!-- see [[:de:Josef Kollmann]] --&gt;, a collaborator of Virchow, stated in the same congress that the people of Europe, be they English, German, French, and Spaniard belonged to a "mixture of various races," furthermore declaring that the "results of craniology...[are] against any theory concerning the superiority of this or that European race" to others.&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt;

Virchow's contribution to the debate sparked a controversy. [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], a strong supporter of the theory of a superior Aryan race or Germanic race, attacked Josef Kollmann arguments in detail. While the "Aryan race" theory remained popular, particularly in Germany, some authors defended Virchow's perspective, in particular [[Otto Schrader (philologist)|Otto Schrader]], [[Rudolph von Jhering]] and the ethnologist [[Robert Hartmann (naturalist)|Robert Hartmann]] (1831–1893), who proposed to ban the notion of "Aryan" from anthropology.&lt;ref name=Orsucci/&gt;

=== Theosophy ===
{{Main|Root race}}

The [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] movement, founded by [[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]] and [[Henry Steel Olcott|Henry Olcott]] at the end of the nineteenth century, took inspiration from Indian culture, in this case, perhaps, from the Hindu reform movement the [[Arya Samaj]] founded by [[Dayananda Saraswati|Swami Dayananda]].
Blavatsky argued that humanity had descended from a series of "root races", naming the fifth root race (out of seven) the Aryan race. She thought that the Aryans originally [[The Secret Doctrine#Volume two|came from]] [[Atlantis]] and described the Aryan races with the following words:

{{quote|The Aryan races, for instance, now varying from dark brown, almost black, red-brown-yellow, down to the whitest creamy colour, are yet all of one and the same stock – the Fifth Root-Race – and spring from one single progenitor, ... who is said to have lived over 18,000,000 years ago, and also 850,000 years ago – at the time of the sinking of the last remnants of the great continent of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, [[The Secret Doctrine|The Secret Doctrine, the Synthesis of Science, Religion and Philosophy]], Vol. II, p.249&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blavatsky used "Root Race" as a technical term to describe human evolution over the large [[time]] periods in her [[cosmology]]. However, she also claimed that there were modern non-Aryan peoples who were inferior to Aryans. She regularly contrasts "Aryan" with "[[Semitic people|Semitic]]" culture, to the detriment of the latter, asserting that Semitic peoples are an offshoot of Aryans who have become "degenerate in spirituality and perfected in materiality."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; She also states that some peoples are "semi-animal creatures". These latter include "the Tasmanians, a portion of the Australians and a mountain tribe in China". There are also "considerable numbers of the mixed Lemuro-Atlantean peoples produced by various crossings with such semi-human stocks – e.g., the wild men of Borneo, the Veddhas of Ceylon, most of the remaining Australians, Bushmen, Negritos, Andaman Islanders, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, pp. 195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Blavatsky's admirers claim that her thinking was not connected to fascist or racialist ideas, asserting that she believed in a [[Universal Brotherhood]] of humanity and wrote that "all men have spiritually and physically the same origin" and that "mankind is essentially of one and the same essence".&lt;ref&gt;''The Key to Theosophy'', Section 3&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, in ''The Secret Doctrine'', Blavatsky states: "Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence."

Blavatsky connects physical race with spiritual attributes constantly throughout her works:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellectual difference between the Aryan and other civilized nations and such savages as the [[South Sea Islanders]], is inexplicable on any other grounds. No amount of culture, nor generations of training amid civilization, could raise such human specimens as the [[San people|Bushmen]], the [[Veddhas]] of [[Ceylon]], and some [[African Tribes|African tribes]], to the same intellectual level as the Aryans, the [[Semitic people|Semites]], and the [[Turanian]]s so called. The 'sacred spark' is missing in them and it is they who are the only inferior races on the globe, now happily – owing to the wise adjustment of nature which ever works in that direction – fast dying out. Verily mankind is 'of one blood,' but not of the same essence. We are the hot-house, artificially quickened plants in nature, having in us a spark, which in them is latent."&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p 421&lt;/ref&gt; ... Esoteric history teaches that idols and their worship died out with the Fourth Race, until the survivors of the hybrid races of the latter (Chinamen, African Negroes, &amp;c.) gradually brought the worship back. The Vedas countenance no idols; all the modern Hindu writings do.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol. II, p.723&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Blavatsky, "the MONADS of the lowest specimens of humanity (the "narrow-brained" savage South-Sea Islander, the African, the Australian) had no Karma to work out when first born as men, as their more favoured brethren in intelligence had".&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p.168&lt;/ref&gt;

She also prophesies of the destruction of the racial "failures of nature" as the future "higher race" ascends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus will mankind, race after race, perform its appointed cycle-pilgrimage. Climates will, and have already begun, to change, each tropical year after the other dropping one sub-race, but only to beget another higher race on the ascending cycle; while a series of other less favoured groups – the failures of nature – will, like some individual men, vanish from the human family without even leaving a trace behind.&lt;ref&gt;Blavatsky, ''The Secret Doctrine'', Vol II, p.446&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The second subrace of the Fifth or Aryan root race, the Arabian, is regarded by Theosophists as one of the Aryan subraces. It is believed by Theosophists that the Arabians, although asserted in traditional Theosophy to be of Aryan (i.e., Indo-European) ancestry, adopted the [[Semitic language]] of the people around them who had migrated earlier from Atlantis (the fifth or (original) Semite subrace of the Atlantean root race). Theosophists assert that the [[Jews]] originated as an offshoot of the Arabian subrace in what is now [[Yemen]] about 30,000&amp;nbsp;BC. They migrated first to [[Somalia]] and then later to [[Egypt]], where they lived until the time of [[Moses]]. Thus, according to the teachings of Theosophy, the Jews are part of the Aryan race.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, A.E. ''The Solar System: A Complete Outline of the Theosophical Scheme of Evolution'' London:1930 The Theosophical Publishing House  Pages 298-299&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ariosophy ===
{{Main|Ariosophy}}

[[Guido von List]] (and his followers such as [[Lanz von Liebenfels]]) later took up some of Blavatsky's ideas, mixing her ideology with nationalistic and fascist ideas; this system of thought became known as [[Ariosophy]]. It was believed in Ariosophy that the [[Germanic languages|Teutonic]]s were superior to all other peoples because according to Theosophy the Teutonics or Nordics were the most recent subrace of the Aryan root race to have evolved.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''The Occult Roots of Nazism: Secret Aryan Cults and Their Influence on Nazi Ideology'' New York:1992 New York University Press Chapter 13 "Herbert Reichstein and Ariosophy" Pages 164-176&lt;/ref&gt; Such views also fed into the development of Nazi ideology. Theosophical publications such as ''[[The Aryan Path]]'' were strongly opposed to the Nazi usage, attacking [[Racism|racialism]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Nazism ===
{{Further|Nazism and race}}

The ideology of [[Nazism]] was based upon the conception of the ancient Aryan race being a [[master race|superior race]], holding the highest position in the [[racial hierarchy]] and that the [[Germanic peoples]] were the most racially pure existing peoples of Aryan stock.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=30}} The Nazi conception of the Aryan race arose from earlier proponents of a supremacist conception of the race as described by racial theorist figures such as [[Arthur de Gobineau]] and [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=21–22}}

Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] identified the European race as having five subtype races: [[Nordic race|Nordic]], [[Mediterranean race|Mediterranean]], [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]].&lt;ref name="Bruce David Baum 2006.

Günther distinguished Aryans from Jews, and identified Jews as descending from non-European races, particularly from what he classified as the Near Asian race (''Vorderasiatische'') more commonly known as the [[Armenoid race]], and said that such origins rendered Jews fundamentally different from and incompatible with Germans and most Europeans.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008.

''Studying the Jew: Scholarly Antisemitism in Nazi Germany''. Harvard University Press, 2008. P. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''Racial Characteristics of the Jewish People'', he defined the racial soul of the Near Eastern race as emphasizing a "commercial spirit" (''Handelgeist''), and described them as "artful traders" - a term that Gunther ascribed as being used by Jewish racial theorist Samuel Weissenberg to describe contemporary Armenians, Greeks, and Jews.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008. P. 28"/&gt; Günther added to that description of the Near Eastern type as being composed primarily of commercially spirited and artful traders, by claiming that the type held strong [[psychological manipulation]] skills that aided them in trade.&lt;ref name="Alan E Steinweis 2008.

Pp. 167, 209"/&gt;

Shortly after the Nazis came to power in 1933 they passed the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] law which required all civil servants to provide proof of their Aryan ancestry and defined "non-Aryan" as a person with one Jewish grandparent.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"&gt;Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.10&lt;/ref&gt; In 1933, the German Interior Ministry official Albert Gorter drafted an official definition of the "Aryan race" for the new law which included all non-Jewish Europeans, this definition was unacceptable by the Nazis.&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich"&gt;Eric Ehrenreich. ''The Nazi Ancestral Proof: Genealogy, Racial Science, and the Final Solution''. Bloomington, Indiana, USA: Indiana University Press, pp.9-10&lt;/ref&gt; However, Achim Gerke revised Gorter's draft of the Civil Service Law classifying Aryans as people "tribally" related to "German blood".&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich" /&gt; The [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg race laws]] of 1935 classified as "racially acceptable" people with "German or related blood".&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler often doubted whether Czechs were Aryan or not, he said in his table talk "It is enough for a Czech to grow a moustache for anyone to see, from the way the thing droops, that his origin is [[Mongoloid|Mongolian]]."&lt;ref name="Hitler2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Adolf Hitler|title=Hitler's Table Talk, 1941-1944: Secret Conversations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JIbqZ_F5UhkC|date=30 April 2008|publisher=Enigma Books|isbn=978-1-929631-66-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question of whether Italians were Aryan enough was questioned by the Nazi racial theorists. Hitler viewed northern Italians as strongly Aryan, but not southern Italians. The Nazis viewed the downfall of the [[Roman Empire]] as being the result of the pollution of blood from racial intermixing, claiming that Italians were a hybrid of races, including black African races. Hitler even mentioned his view of the presence of Negroid blood in the Mediterranean peoples during his first meeting with Mussolini in 1934.&lt;ref name="Gillette2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Aaron Gillette|title=Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Gjq0ZPvIZgC|date=12 October 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-52706-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of "Aryan" remained in constant flux to such an extent that the Nazis questioned whether European ethnic groups such as Finns or Hungarians were to be classified as "Aryans".&lt;ref name="Eric Ehrenreich" /&gt; Hungarians were classified as "tribally alien" but not necessarily "blood alien", in 1934 the Nazis published a pamphlet which declared [[Magyars]] (which it did not define) as Aryans.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"/&gt; The following year, an article published by the Nazis admitted that there were disputes over the racial status of Hungarians.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"/&gt; As late as 1943, there were disputes over whether Hungarians were to be classified as Aryan.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenreich, The Nazi ancestral proof, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1942, Hitler declared that the Finns were "racially related Germanic neighboring peoples", although there is no evidence to suggest that this was based on anything racial.&lt;ref name="Ehrenreich p.10"/&gt;

The idea of the Northern origins of the Aryans was particularly influential in [[Germany]]. It was widely believed that the "Vedic Aryans" were ethnically identical to the [[Goths]], [[Vandals]] and other ancient Germanic peoples of the ''[[Völkerwanderung]]''. This idea was often intertwined with [[antisemitic]] ideas. The distinctions between the "Aryan" and "[[Semitic people|Semitic]]" peoples were based on the aforementioned linguistic and ethnic history. A complete, highly speculative theory of Aryan and anti-Semitic history can be found in [[Alfred Rosenberg]]'s major work, ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]''.
Semitic peoples came to be seen as a foreign presence within Aryan societies, and the Semitic peoples were often pointed to as the cause of conversion and destruction of social order and values leading to culture and civilization's downfall by proto-Nazi theorists such as [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

These and other ideas evolved into the [[Nazism|Nazi]] use of the term "Aryan race" to refer to what they saw as being a [[master race|superior race]], which was narrowly defined by the Nazis as being identical with the [[Nordic race]], followed by other sub-races of the Aryan race and excluding Slavs as non-Aryan. They worked to maintain the purity of this race through [[Nazi eugenics|eugenics]] programs (including [[Miscegenation|anti-miscegenation]] legislation, [[compulsory sterilization]] of the mentally ill and the mentally deficient, the execution of the institutionalized mentally ill as part of a [[T-4 Euthanasia Program|euthanasia program]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[Heinrich Himmler]] (the ''[[Reichsführer]]'' of the [[SS]]), the person ordered by [[Adolf Hitler]] to implement the [[Final Solution]], or the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]],&lt;ref&gt;Himmler noted on 26 July 1942 in response to Rosenberg’s attempt to influence Jewish policy that "The occupied territories will be [[Judenfrei|Jew-free]]. The [[Fuhrer]] has laid the implementation of this very difficult order on my shoulders." [[Richard J. Evans|Evans, Richard J.]] ''The Third Reich at War'' New York:2008 Penguin Page 271; Himmler had begun the initial pre-[[Wansee Conference]] implementation of the [[final solution]] by July and August of 1941.

=== Italian Fascism ===
{{main|Italian Fascism and racism}}

In a 1921 speech in [[Bologna]], Mussolini stated that "Fascism was born... out of a profound, perennial need of this our Aryan and [[Mediterranean race]]".&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neocleous, Mark. ''Fascism''. Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA: University of Minnesota Press, 1997. p.&amp;nbsp;35&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech Mussolini was referring to Italians as being the Mediterranean branch of the Aryan race, Aryan in the meaning of people of an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] and culture.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Italian Fascism emphasized that race was bound by spiritual and cultural foundations, and identified a racial hierarchy based on spiritual and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; While Italian Fascism based its conception of race on spiritual and cultural factors, Mussolini explicitly rejected notions that biologically "pure" races existed though biology was still considered a relevant factor in race.&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;Glenda Sluga. ''The Problem of Trieste and the Italo-Yugoslav Border: Difference, Identity, and Sovereignty in Twentieth-Century''. SUNY Press, 2001. P. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian Fascism strongly rejected the common [[Nordic race|Nordicist]] conception of the Aryan race that idealized "pure" Aryans as having certain physical traits that were defined as Nordic such as blond hair and blue eyes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The antipathy by Mussolini and other Italian Fascists to Nordicism was over the existence of what they viewed as the Mediterranean [[inferiority complex]] that they claimed had been instilled into Mediterraneans by the propagation of such theories by German and Anglo-Saxon Nordicists who viewed Mediterranean peoples as racially degenerate and thus in their view inferior.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Mussolini refused to allow Italy to return again to this inferiority complex, initially rejecting Nordicism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; However traditional Nordicist claims of Mediterraneans being degenerate due to having a darker colour of skin than Nordics had long been rebuked in anthropology through the depigmentation theory that claimed that lighter-skinned peoples had been depigmented from a darker skin, this theory has since become a widely accepted view in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;Alan W. Ertl. Toward an Understanding of Europe:A Political Economic Précis of Continental Integration. Boca Raton, Florida, USA: Universal Publishers, 2008. P. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist [[Carleton S. Coon]] in his work ''The races of Europe'' (1939) subscribed to depigmentation theory that claimed that the Nordic race's light-coloured skin was the result of depigmentation from their ancestors of the Mediterranean race.&lt;ref&gt;Melville Jacobs, Bernhard Joseph Stern. General anthropology. Barnes &amp; Noble, 1963. P. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1930s, with the rise to power of the [[Nazi Party]] in Germany with ''[[Führer]]'' [[Adolf Hitler]]'s emphasis on a Nordicist conception of the Aryan race, strong tensions arose between the Fascists and the Nazis over racial issues. In 1934, in the aftermath of Austrian Nazis killing Austrian Chancellor [[Engelbert Dollfuss]], an ally of Italy, Mussolini became enraged and responded by angrily denouncing Nazism. Mussolini rebuked Nazism's Nordicism, claiming that the Nazis' emphasizing of a common Nordic "Germanic race" was absurd, saying "a Germanic race does not exist. ... We repeat. Does not exist. Scientists say so. Hitler says so."&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. Racial Theories in Fascist Italy. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was indeed acknowledged by prominent Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), where Günther recognized Germans as being composed of five Aryan subtype races: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]] while asserting that the Nordics were the highest in a racial hierarchy of the five subtypes.&lt;ref name="Maxwell150"/&gt;

By 1936, the tensions between Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany reduced and relations became more amicable. In 1936, Mussolini decided to launch a racial programme in Italy, and was interested in the racial studies being conducted by [[Giulio Cogni]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cogni was a Nordicist but did not equate Nordic identity with Germanic identity as was commonly done by German Nordicists.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Cogni had travelled to Germany where he had become impressed by Nazi racial theory and sought to create his own version of racial theory.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 59-60.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 September 1936, Cogni sent Mussolini a copy of his newly published book ''Il Razzismo'' (1936).&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; Cogni declared the racial affinity of the Mediterranean and Nordic racial subtypes of the Aryan race and claimed that the intermixing of Nordic Aryans and Mediterranean Aryans in Italy produced a superior synthesis of Aryan Italians.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 61"/&gt; Cogni addressed the issue of racial differences between northern and southern Italians, declaring southern Italians were mixed between Aryan and non-Aryan races, that he claimed was most likely due to infiltration by Asiatic peoples in Roman times and later Arab invasions.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; As such, Cogni viewed Southern Italian Mediterraneans as being polluted with orientalizing tendencies.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt; He would later change his idea and claim that Nordics and Southern Italians were closely related groups both racially and spiritually. His opinion was that they were generally responsible for what is the best in European civilization.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt;  Initially Mussolini was not impressed with Cogni's work, however Cogni's ideas entered into the official Fascist racial policy several years later.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 60"/&gt;

In 1938 Mussolini was concerned that if Italian Fascism did not recognize Nordic heritage within Italians, that the Mediterranean inferiority complex would return to Italian society.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt; Therefore, in summer 1938, the Fascist government officially recognized Italians as having Nordic heritage and being of Nordic-Mediterranean descent and in a meeting with PNF members, and in June 1938 in a meeting with PNF members, Mussolini identified himself as Nordic and declared that previous policy of focus on Mediterraneanism was to be replaced by a focus on Aryanism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated7"/&gt;

The Fascist regime began publication of the racialist magazine ''[[La Difesa della Razza]]'' in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordicist racial theorist [[Guido Landra]] took a major role in the early work of ''La Difesa'', and published the ''Manifesto of Racial Scientists'' in the magazine in 1938.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manifesto'' received substantial criticism, including its assertion of Italians being a "pure race", as it was viewed as absurd.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"/&gt; ''La Difesa'' published other theories that described long-term Nordic Aryan amongst Italians, such as the theory that in the [[Eneolithic]] age Nordic Aryans arrived to Italy.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 81"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the writers took up the traditional Nordicist claim that the decline and fall of the Roman Empire was due to the arrival of Semitic immigrants.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 81"/&gt; ''La Difesa'''s writers were divided on their claims that described how Italians extricated themselves from Semitic influence.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 80"/&gt;

The Nordicist direction of Fascist racial policy was challenged in 1938 by a resurgence of the Mediterraneanist faction in the PNF.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-111.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1939, the Mediterraneanists' advocacy of a nativist racial theory that rejected ascribing the achievements of the Italian people to Nordic peoples.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"/&gt; This nativist racial policy was prominently promoted by [[Ugo Rellini]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-111"/&gt; Rellini rejected the notion of large-scale invasions of Italy by Nordic Aryans in the Eneolithic age, and claimed that Italians were an indigenous people descended from the [[Cro-Magnon]]s.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-112"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. P. 110-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Rellini claimed that Mediterranean and Nordic peoples arrived later and peacefully intermixed in small numbers with the indigenous Italian population.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002. P. 110-112"/&gt;

In 1941 the PNF's Mediterraneanists through the influence of [[Giacomo Acerbo]] put forward a comprehensive definition of the Italian race.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"&gt;Aaron Gillette. ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2001. Pp. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; However these efforts were challenged by Mussolini's endorsement of Nordicist figures with the appointment of staunch spiritual Nordicist [[Alberto Luchini]] as head of Italy's Racial Office in May 1941, as well as with Mussolini becoming interested in [[Julius Evola]]'s spiritual Nordicism in late 1941.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; Acerbo and the Mediterraneanists in his High Council on Demography and Race sought to bring the regime back to supporting Mediterraneanism by thoroughly denouncing the pro-Nordicist ''Manifesto of the Racial Scientists''.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council recognized Aryans as being a linguistic-based group, and condemned the ''Manifesto'' for denying the influence of pre-Aryan civilization on modern Italy, saying that the ''Manifesto'' "constitutes an unjustifiable and undemonstrable negation of the anthropological, ethnological, and archaeological discoveries that have occurred and are occurring in our country".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; Furthermore, the Council denounced the ''Manifesto'' for "implicitly" crediting Germanic invaders of Italy in the guise of the [[Lombards]] for having "a formative influence on the Italian race in a disproportional degree to the number of invaders and to their biological predominance".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council claimed that the obvious superiority of the ancient Greeks and Romans in comparison with the ancient Germanic tribes made it inconceivable that Italian culture owed a debt to ancient Aryan Germans.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt; The Council denounced the ''Manifesto'''s Nordicist attitude towards Mediterraneans that it claimed was "considering them as slaves" and was "a repudiation of the entire Italian civilization".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2001. Pp. 146"/&gt;

[[Image:Crossed circle.svg|thumb|right|125px|The [[Sun cross|sun wheel]] has been used as a symbol of the Aryan race by some neo-Nazis]]

=== Neo-Nazism ===
Since the military defeat of Nazi Germany by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1945, some [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazis]] have developed a more inclusive definition of "Aryan", claiming that the peoples of [[Western Europe]] are the closest descendants of the ancient Aryans, with [[Nordic race|Nordic]] and [[Germanic peoples]] being the most "racially pure."&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity'' New York: 2002--N.Y. University Press, See Chapter 15 for a discussion of ''Aryan [[identity politics]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], many neo-Nazis want to establish an [[Autocracy|autocratic state]] modeled after Nazi Germany to be called the ''[[Fourth Reich#Neo-Nazism|Western Imperium]]''. It is believed that this proposed state would be able to attain [[Hyperpower|world domination]] by combining the [[nuclear arsenal]]s of the four major Aryan [[world power]]s, the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], and [[Russia]] under a single military command.&lt;ref name="GC"&gt;{{cite book|author=Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas|title=Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism and the Politics of Identity|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|year=2003|pages=221|isbn=0-8147-3155-4|oclc = |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This proposed state would be led by a ''Führer''-like figure called the ''Vindex'', and would include all areas inhabited by the "Aryan race", as conceived by Neo-Nazis. Only those of the Aryan race would be full citizens of the state. The "Western Imperium" would embark on a vigorous and dynamic program of [[space exploration]], followed by the creation by [[genetic engineering]] of a  [[super race]] called [[Super race#Homo Galactica|Homo Galactica]]. The concept of the "Western Imperium" as outlined in the previous three sentences is based on the original concept of the ''Imperium'' as outlined in the 1947 book ''Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics'' by [[Francis Parker Yockey]] as further updated, extended and refined in the early 1990s in pamphlets published by [[David Myatt]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke, Nicholas ''[[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|Black Sun]]: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and The Politics of Identity'' New York: 2002--N.Y.

==Voting trends==
From the 1940s to the 1990s most Asian Americans were anti-communist refugees who had fled mainland China, North Korea or Vietnam, and were strongly anti-Communist. Many had ties to conservative organizations.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey D. Schultz 2000 pp 261-62"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Wei, ''The Asian American movement'' (1993)   pp 16, 226, 274&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, more liberal Asian-American groups such as newer Chinese and Indian immigrants have greatly changed the Asian-American political demographics, as well as a larger proportion of younger Asian Americans, many of whom have completed college degrees.&lt;ref&gt;William Wei, ''The Asian American movement'' (1993) pp 170, 274&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s and 2000s, Asian American voting behavior shifted from moderate support for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to stronger support for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://prospect.org/article/how-asian-americans-became-democrats-0|title=How Asian Americans Became Democrats|newspaper=The American Prospect|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1992 United States Presidential Election|1992 presidential election]] Republican [[George H. W. Bush]] received 55% of the Asian-American vote compared to 31% for Democrat [[Bill Clinton]]. Asian Americans voted Republican and were the only racial group more conservative than whites in the 1990s, according to surveys.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey D. Schultz 2000 pp 261-62"&gt;Jeffrey D. Schultz, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics'' (2000) Volume 1 pp 261-62&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], Democrat [[John Kerry]] won 56% of the Asian American vote, with Chinese and Indian Americans tending to support Kerry, and Vietnamese and Filipino Americans tending to support [[George W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1439">The '''Automated System for Customs Data''' (ASYCUDA) is a [[compute]]rized system designed by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) to administer a country's customs. In 2004 there were more than 50 operational projects with expenditures exceeding US$7 million. It is the largest [[technical cooperation]] programme of the UNCTAD, covering over 80 countries and 4 regional projects.

There are three generations of ASYCUDA in use: ASYCUDA version 2.7, ASYCUDA++ &lt;ref&gt;[https://asycuda.org/pdf%20docs/sffunct.pdf Asycuda ++]&lt;/ref&gt; and ASYCUDA World. They were built using different paradigms and [[solution]]s available at conception.{{what|date=May 2014}} ASYCUDA World is the most recent version. [[Cape Verde]] adopted use of ASYCUDA World in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asycuda.org/wnfiles/CAPVERT-Article-GB.pdf Official ASYCUDA World Launch ceremony in Cap Verde], 12 January 2016, accessed 1 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

UNCTAD's aim was to build a computer system to assist customs authorities (or their local equivalents) all over the world to automate and control their core processes and obtain timely, accurate and valuable information to support government projections and planning.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9699">'''Benjamin Franklin's phonetic alphabet''' was [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposal for a [[English spelling reform|spelling reform]] of the [[English language]]. The alphabet was based on the [[Latin alphabet]] used in English. Franklin modified the standard English alphabet by omitting the letters c, j, q, w, x, and y, and adding new letters to explicitly represent the open-mid back [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|rounded]] and [[Open-mid back unrounded vowel|unrounded]] vowels, and the consonants sh, ng, voiced th, and voiceless th. It was one of the earlier proposed spelling reforms to the English language. The alphabet consisted of 26 letters in the following order:&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, Benjamin.

Other English phonemes are represented as follows:
*{{IPAc-en|hw}} is represented as ''hu'' (as in ''huɥi'' for ''why'').
*{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} is represented as ''ɥi'' (as in ''ɥiz'' for ''eyes'').
*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} is represented ''cɩu'' (as in ''hcɩus'' for ''house'').
*{{IPAc-en|dʒ}} is represented ''dի'' (as in ''edի'' for ''age'').
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}}, at the time more probably {{IPA|[eː~ɛː]}}, is represented as ''ee'' or ''e'' (as in ''leet'' for ''late'' or ''kes'' for ''case'').
*{{IPAc-en|ɛər}} is represented as ''eer'' (as in ''keer'' for ''care'' or ''᷄ⱨeer'' for ''their'').
*{{IPAc-en|ɜr}} and {{IPAc-en|ər}} are represented as ''ɥr'' (as ''lɥrn'' for ''learn'').
*{{IPAc-en|iː}} is represented as ''ii'' or ''i'' (as in ''ſtriim'' for ''stream'').
*{{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}} is represented ''cɩɥi'' (as in ''distrcɩɥi'' for ''destroy'').
*{{IPAc-en|ɔr}} is represented ''cɩr'' (as in ''fcɩrget'' for ''forget'').
**{{IPAc-en|oʊ|r}}, at the time [[horse-hoarse merger|separate]], is represented ''or'' (as in ''kors'' for ''course'').
*{{IPAc-en|tʃ}} is represented ''tի'' (as in ''tիit'' for ''cheat''). 
*{{IPAc-en|ʒ}} is represented ''zի'' (as in ''mezիɥr'' for ''measure'').
*Unstressed vowels are generally represented by the letters used to represent their stressed equivalents. What today is considered a [[schwa]] is mostly represented with ''ɥ'', although whenever spelled in standard English with ''a'', Franklin maintains the symbol ''a''.

[[File:Benjamin Franklin's alphabet - sample letter.png|thumb|340px|Sample text in Franklin's phonetic alphabet from a letter to Franklin.]]

==Vowels==

Franklin's proposed alphabet included seven letters to represent vowels. This set consisted of two new letters, in addition to five letters from the existing English alphabet: a, e, i, o, u. The first new letter was a formed as a ligature of the letters o and a, and used to represent the sound {{IPAblink|ɔ}} (as written in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]). The second, ɥ, was used for {{IPAblink|ʌ}}.

Franklin proposed the use of doubled letters to represent what he called long vowels, represented by modern phonemes thus: {{IPAc-en|ɔː}} as the long-vowel variant for {{IPAc-en|ɒ}} (or, in his notation, ''cɩcɩ'' versus ''cɩ''), {{IPAc-en|eɪ}} for {{IPAc-en|ɛ}} (''ee'' versus ''e''), and {{IPAc-en|iː}} for {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} (''ii'' versus ''i''). However, these distinctions appear not perfectly identical to the distinctions today; for example, the only word shown to use ''cɩcɩ'' is the word ''all'', but not other words that in modern notation would use {{IPA|/ɔː/}}. This discrepancy may reflect Franklin's own inconsistencies, but, even more likely, it reflects legitimate differences in the English phonology of his particular time and place.

In his examples of writing in the proposed alphabet, Franklin contrasts long and short uses of his letter e, with the words "mend" and "remain," respectively spelled in Franklin's system as "mend" and "remeen." In this system, the doubled "ee" is used to represent the {{IPA|/eɪ/}} sound in "late" and "pale." Likewise, "ii" is used to represent the {{IPA|/iː/}} sound in "degrees", "pleased", and "serene."

London, 1779.&lt;/ref&gt; is inconsistent in this regard, representing the {{IPA|/eɪ/}} sound in "great" and "compared" with the accented letter "ê" instead of "ee".

Franklin does not appear to make a distinction between the modern {{IPAc-en|uː}} and {{IPAc-en|ʊ}} [[phoneme]]s, which likely reveals another difference between eighteenth-century English pronunciation versus modern pronunciation.

==Consonants==
Franklin's proposed alphabet included nineteen letters to represent consonants. This set consisted of four new letters, in addition to fifteen letters from the existing English alphabet: b, d, f, g, h, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, z. New letters were proposed to replace the English [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s ng, sh, [[Voiced dental fricative|voiced th]], and [[Voiceless dental fricative|voiceless th]]. New consonant digraphs based on these new letters were used to represent the [[affricate]] sounds of ch in cherry and j in January.

The most influential of Franklin's six new characters appears to have been the letter eng, {{IPA link|ŋ|&lt;}}, for "ng".  It was later incorporated into the IPA.  [[Alexander Gill the Elder]] had used this letter in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, David Crystal&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1569">The British '''Atomic Scientists Association''' ('''ASA''' or '''BASA'''), was founded by [[Joseph Rotblat]] in 1946.

It was a politically neutral group, composed of eminent physicists and other scientists and was concerned with matters of British public policy regarding applications and dangers of nuclear physics (including [[nuclear weapons]] and [[nuclear power]]).

In so doing it also sought to inform fellow scientists and the public of the essential facts, usually via published papers and other documents.

== Members ==
The vice-president (VP) was the executive head while the president (P) was the
honorary position.

==History==
Change.org was launched on May 28, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2007/02/07/social-networking-for-change/|title = Social Networking For Change(.org)|author = Gonzalez, Nick|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]|date = February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; by current chief executive [[Ben Rattray]], with the support of founding [[chief technology officer]] Mark Dimas, Darren Haas,&lt;ref name="Veneziani"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/02/07/social-networking-for-change/|title=Social Networking For Change(.org)|first=Vince|last=Veneziani|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|date= February 7, 2007|accessdate= December 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adam Cheyer]].&lt;ref name="Veneziani"/&gt; As of February 2012, the site had 100 employees with offices on four continents. By the end of 2012, Rattray stated "he plans to have offices in 20 countries and to operate in several more languages, including Arabic and Chinese."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/kristof-after-recess-change-the-world.html?_r=1|title = 'After Recess - Change the World'|author = [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof, Nicholas]]| work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, the company announced a $15 million round of investment led by Omidyar Network and said it has 170 staff members in 18 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Empson|first=Rick|title=With $15M From Omidyar And 35M+ Users, Change.org Wants To Prove Socially-Minded Startups Can Attract Big Numbers|url=https://techcrunch.com/2013/05/21/with-15m-from-omidyar-and-35m-users-change-org-wants-to-prove-socially-minded-business-can-attract-big-numbers/|accessdate=1 July 2013|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=21 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Change.org claimed it was the subject of a [[distributed denial of service]] attack by "Chinese hackers",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Branigan|first=Tania|title=Ai Weiwei campaign website 'victim of Chinese hackers'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/apr/20/ai-weiwei-campaign-website-chinese-hackers|work = [[The Guardian]] |date=April 20, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the alleged attack was apparently related to its petition to the [[government of China|Chinese government]] to release artist [[Ai Weiwei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Joffe-Walt|first=Benjamin|title=Chinese Hackers Attack Change.org Platform in Reaction to Ai Weiwei Campaign|url=http://blog.change.org/2011/04/chinese-hackers-attack-change-org-platform-in-reaction-to-ai-weiwei-campaign/|publisher=Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, there was a proposal to merge the Spanish-speaking counterpart website ''Actuable'' into ''Change.org''. It took place in 2012 when they approved the voluntary union of ''Actuable'' users into the ''Change.org'' platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publico.es/ciencias/397493/actuable-se-fusiona-con-change-org-y-crean-la-mayor-plataforma-de-ciberactivismo-online |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228184822/http://www.publico.es/ciencias/397493/actuable-se-fusiona-con-change-org-y-crean-la-mayor-plataforma-de-ciberactivismo-online |archivedate=2012-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tecnologia.elpais.com/tecnologia/2011/09/20/actualidad/1316509269_850215.html |title=Change.org adquiere la española Actuable &amp;#124; Tecnología &amp;#124; EL PAÍS |publisher=Tecnologia.elpais.com |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, [[Arizona State University]] decided to block access to Change.org in response to a petition created by student Eric Haywood protesting "rising tuition costs at the school". University officials claimed that "Change.org is a spam site" and the blocking was conducted "to protect the use of our limited and valuable network resources for legitimate academic, research, and administrative uses".&lt;ref name="huffpost"&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/josh-levy/arizona-state-censors-cha_b_1253155.html|title = Arizona State Censors Change.org|author = Levy, Josh | work  = [[The Huffington Post]] |date = February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported on April 5, 2012, that Change.org hit 10 million members, and was the fastest-growing social action platform on the web. At that time, they were receiving 500 new petitions per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/05/change-org-hits-10-million-members-now-the-fastest-growing-social-action-platform-on-the-web |title=Change.org Hits 10 Million Members, Now The "Fastest-Growing Social Action Platform On The Web" |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2012-04-05 |accessdate=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 13, 2012, ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[BBC News]] and other sources reported that Change.org would launch a UK-specific platform for petitions, placing Change.org in competition with [[38 Degrees]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/may/14/trayvon-epetition-website-changeorg-launches-uk|title = Trayvon Martin petition site Change.org comes to UK| work = [[The Guardian]]|author = Topping, Alexandra |date = May 13, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18033968|title = Change.org petition site targets UK campaigners|author = Kelion, Leo|date = May 14, 2012|publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; a British not-for-profit political-activism organization.

An August 2013 ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'s'' article reported that Change.org would soon begin featuring petition recipients, saying, "For the first time, companies will be able to post a public response to any given petition (currently, they can only respond to the person who started the campaign). They will also be able to create their own Decision Maker page, which will show all petitions against them, the number of signatures gathered, and their statuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bluestein|first=Adam|title=HOW BEN RATTRAY'S CHANGE.ORG BECAME A VIRAL CONSUMER WATCHDOG|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/3014809/change-org-petitions-ben-rattray|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer 2017, a petition on change.org called for [[/r/incels]] (incel named after an abbreviation for "[[inceldom|involuntary celibate]]") to be banned for inciting violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/incels-reddit-banned.html|title=Reddit Bans 'Incel' Group for Inciting Violence Against Women|last=Hauser|first=Christine|date=2017-11-09|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-12|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable petitions==

===In Brazil===
On November 12th, 2018, a petition entitled “Contra o aumento de salário aos ministros do STF” exceed the record of signatures with 2,6 million. Much more than "Aprovem o Pedido de Impeachment da Presidente Dilma" with 2,23 million.

===In the United States===
On March 8, 2012, a petition entitled "Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|Trayvon Martin]]" was posted on Change.org. The petition received over 2.2 million signatures – at that time the largest number of signatures for any campaign in Change.org's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/prosecute-the-killer-of-our-son-17-year-old-trayvon-martin|title = Prosecute the killer of our son, 17-year-old Trayvon Martin|publisher = Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition called for the prosecution of [[George Zimmerman]], a neighborhood watch volunteer, who, on February 26, 2012, shot and killed Trayvon Martin in [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]], [[Florida]], a suburb of [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]]. Zimmerman said he was acting in self-defense, and was set free without being charged. On April 11, 2012, Zimmerman was arrested and charged with second-degree murder. He stood trial in the months of June and July and was acquitted of all charges on July 13, 2013.

On October 1, 2011, Molly Katchpole, a "22 year old nanny with two jobs" in [[Washington D.C.]], started a petition on Change.org "asking [[Bank of America]] and their CEO Bryan Moynihan to drop its unexpected new $5/month banking fee" for debit card customers. Less than one month later, 300,000 signatures were collected. The petition was widely cited as a contributing cause for the bank formally announcing to drop the new banking fee. [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]] signed the petition; [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Dick Durbin]], the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[senator from Illinois]], responded to Bank of America and the petition on [[Twitter]]. It may have contributed to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] deciding to "look at legislation for out-of-control banking fees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-bank-of-america-no-5-debit-card-fees|title = Tell Bank of America: No $5 Debit Card Fees|publisher = Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, a fourth-grade class in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Massachusetts]], launched the "Lorax Petition Project" through Change.org requesting [[Universal Studios]] to include more of an environmental message on its website and trailer for its upcoming film, ''[[The Lorax (film)|The Lorax]]'', a classic [[Dr. Seuss]] children's story. The website and trailer lacked the important message from the book, "to help the environment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.change.org/petitions/z-let-the-lorax-speak-for-the-trees|title = 'Universal Pictures: Let the Lorax Speak for the Trees!'|publisher = Change.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition collected over 57,000 signatures, and on January 26, 2012, the studio updated the website "with the environmental message the kids had requested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/05/opinion/sunday/kristof-after-recess-change-the-world.html?_r=1|title = After Recess - Change the World|author = [[Nicholas Kristof|Kristof, Nicholas]] | work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of February 2, 2012, Stef Gray, a 23-year-old graduate in New York, held a news conference at the Washington offices of Sallie Mae where she presented the results of her Change.org, [[Sallie Mae]], the "nation's largest private student-loan provider" petition, which had received about 77,000 signers. That afternoon the company changed its forbearance fee policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Lewin, Tamar|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/education/sallie-mae-to-change-forbearance-fee-policy.html?_r=3|title = Sallie Mae to Change Forebearance Fee Policy | work = [[The New York Times]]|date = February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, someone calling himself "[[John Doe]]" of [[Arlington, Texas]] launched a petition against changes made to the [[YouTube]] commenting system by [[Google]]. The changes force YouTube users to create an account on [[Google+]] and also removes the "reply" mechanism on comments unless they were posted on Google+. This petition received over 100,000 signatures in less than a week, and over 200,000 within two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1q92rm/google_change_the_youtube_comment_section_back_to/|publisher=Reddit|title=Change the Youtube comment section back to its original form|year=2013|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition garnered more than 241,000 signatures, but failed to change Google's stance on the matter. However, the changes to YouTube did not have the intended effect &amp;ndash; namely, increasing spam instead of curbing it &amp;ndash; and in mid-2015, the commenting system was altered to allow users to post comments without signing into Google+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33687110 |title =Google unlinking Google+ from YouTube|work =BBC News |location=London |date =July 28, 2015 |accessdate=July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, Aaron Thompson from [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama]] started a petition, directed at Seth MacFarlane to bring back Brian Griffin on the TV series ''[[Family Guy]]'', after he was briefly killed off in the Season 12 episode "[[Life of Brian (Family Guy)|Life Of Brian]]". Thompson's petition gained 30,000 signatures within 36 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/26/irate-family-guy-fans-strike-up-online-petition-to-bring-major-character-back-to-life-4202038/|title=Irate Family Guy fans strike up online petition to bring major character back to life|publisher=[[Metro.co.uk]]|last=Westbrook|first=Caroline|date=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/11/27/disgruntled-family-guy-fans-petition-to-bring-major-character-back-to-life-tops-80000-signatures-4203996/|title=Disgruntled Family Guy fans' petition to bring major character back to life tops 80,000 signatures|publisher=Metro.co.uk|last=Duncan|first=Amy|date=2013-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was brought back to the show a few episodes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/12/16/brian-griffin-back-from-the-dead-on-family-guy-after-stewie-comes-to-the-rescue-4232138/|title=Brian Griffin back from the dead on Family Guy after Stewie comes to the rescue|publisher=Metro.co.uk|last=Lee|first=Ann|date=2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Karol Wilcox of [[Hayti, Missouri]] started a petition against the planned execution of Beau, a two-and-a-half-year-old dog in [[Dyersburg, Tennessee]], for allegedly killing a duck on his owner's property. By November, this petition had gained over 540,000 signatures. The petition worked and the dog was spared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wreg.com/2015/01/30/beau-his-owner-could-be-reunited-this-afternoon/|title=Beau the dog and owner reunited|first1=Ashley|last1=Crockett|first2=Mike|last2=Suriani|publisher=WREG|date=2015-01-30|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 United States presidential election]], in which [[Donald Trump]] was declared [[President-elect of the United States]], there were [[Protests against Donald Trump|mass protests]]. As part of these protests, one California man started a change.org petition on November 10, 2016, which called for electors in states that Trump won to become [[faithless elector]]s and cast their vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] instead at state [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] meetings.

===In Canada===
In August 2014, Erica Perry from [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia|BC]], started a petition asking [[Centerplate]], a large food and beverage corporation serving entertainment venues in North America and the UK, to fire its then-CEO Desmond "Des" Hague after the public release of security camera footage allegedly showing Hague abusing a young [[Doberman Pinscher]] in an elevator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Hanson, Hilary|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/27/des-hague-centerplate-ceo-kicking-puppy_n_5724772.html|title = Des Hague, Multimillionaire CEO, Caught On Tape Kicking Puppy  | work = [[The Huffington Post]]|date = August 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Centerplate not taking action after the incident other than releasing a statement of apology from Hague, and an agreement by Hague to commit to perform certain charitable acts, the petition called for Centerplate to fire Hague. On September 2, 2014, after the petition had received over 190,000 signatures, Hague resigned from his position as CEO of Centerplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Talmazan, Yuliya|url = http://globalnews.ca/news/1528859/centerplate-ceo-des-hague-resigns-over-dog-abuse-video|title = Centerplate CEO Des Hague resigns over dog abuse video  | work = [[Global News]]|date = September 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was a new world record of Changeorg's history.

==Business model==
Change.org makes revenue through a subscription membership model, people promoting petitions on the site, and crowdfunding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/why-change-org-s-army-of-davids-is-neutering-more-global-goliaths-20180228-p4z24h.html|title=Why Change.org's Army of Davids is Neutering More Global Goliaths|last=Bryant|first=Nick|date=3 March 2018|website=smh.com.au|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Change.org members contribute monthly to sustain the technology and the small teams of campaigners who coach and support petition starters. The majority of the company's revenue is advertising - individuals and organisations who start or sign petitions then chip in to promote those petitions to other site visitors.

To date, Change.org has raised $50 million to fuel its growth from mission-aligned investors in business, technology and the media. In 2017 an investment round driven by [[Reid Hoffman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2017/05/26/reid-hoffman-change-org/|title=LinkedIn Founder Reid Hoffman Invests Big Change In Change.org|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped drive the shift to the current business model.

The website previously made revenue by running advertisements called sponsored campaigns for advocacy organizations such as [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mui|first=Ylan M|title=Change.org Emerges as Influential Advocate on Issues from Bullying to Bank Fees|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/changeorg-emerges-as-influential-advocate/2012/01/09/gIQAoCJHLQ_story.html| work = [[The Washington Post]]|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and list-building services to partner organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Martin, Courtney E. |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/164338/you-are-now-now-future-online-feminism|title= 'You Are the NOW of Now!' The Future of (Online) Feminism| work =[[The Nation]]|date= November 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2013 the website started "crowd-promoted petitions" that allowed a signatory to promote the petition by paying $5 to $1000 at the final stage of petition signing.

==Criticism==

===Fake Signatures===
Massive Australian based anti-cycling petition is full of false names, claims Bicycle Queensland CEO. Anne Savage said the body had received information that many of the names were created by electronic “bots”. “We have evidence that the majority of names on that petition are false names,” she said.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/massive-anticycling-petition-full-of-false-names-claims-bicycle-queensland-ceo/news-story/fdf3e0dd06aa3343948dce1020df03b1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visibility of personal information===
Under certain conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Policy {{!}} Change.org|url=http://www.change.org/about/privacy|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{vague|date=January 2015}} signatures and other private information including email addresses can be found by search engines. Change.org operates a system for signature hiding, which works only if the user has an account on Change.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=I want my name off of this petition immediately! : The Change.org Help Desk|url=http://helpdesk.change.org/entries/20272227-i-want-my-name-off-of-this-petition-immediately|publisher=Change.org|accessdate= March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the platform has been criticized for not providing enough information on who has signed a petition; for instance a means of verifying that a petition protesting a politician has been signed by his or her constituents or that the signatures are genuine at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-29/change-org-is-amplifying-the-power-of-a-signature|title=Change.org Is Amplifying the Power of a Signature|first=Sarah|last=Issenberg|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2015-05-29|accessdate=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate structure===
There has been debate and criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Change.org about Real Change or Just Pocket Change? |url=http://chieforganizer.org/2012/06/20/is-change-org-about-real-change-or-just-pocket-change/
|publisher=Chief Organizer Blog|author=Rathke, Wade |date= June 20, 2012|accessdate= July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="changebiz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Change Dot Biz|url=http://www.informationdiet.com/blog/read/change-dot-biz|publisher=The Information Diet|date= February 28, 2012|accessdate= July 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; around the fact that Change.org is a for-profit business despite using the [[.org]] domain suffix rather than the commercial [[.com]]. The site has been accused of fooling its users and hiding the fact that it is "a for-profit entity that has an economic incentive to get people to sign petitions".

{{quote|text=Change.org is being deliberately deceitful through the use of the change.org name. I'd suspect that the average change.org user does not know that Change.org is a for-profit corporation, and that the corporation plans on using the contact information being provided to them to earn revenue.|sign=[[Clay Johnson (technologist)|Clay Johnson]]&lt;ref name="changebiz"/&gt;}}

Change.org spokesperson Charlotte Hill countered this criticism in a September 2013 article in ''[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]'', saying, "We are a mission-driven social enterprise, and while we bring in revenue, we reinvest 100% of that revenue back into our mission of empowering ordinary people. It's not just that we're not yet making a profit – it's that we are decidedly not for-profit." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Klint|first=Finley|title=Meet Change.org, the Google of Modern Politics|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/change-org/|accessdate=7 October 2013|newspaper=Wired Magazine|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advertising policy===
In 2012, the site dropped most of the restrictions it previously placed on paid content. Internal documents began referring to "clients" and "partners" as "advertisers" and stated that "only advertisers strictly identified as 'hate groups' are to be barred."&lt;ref name="kos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/23/1149092/-Change-org-sells-out-progressive-movement|title=Change.org sells out progressive movement|first=Raven|last=Brooks|publisher=Daily Kos|date=2012-10-23|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="karoli"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/why-i-will-not-sign-another-changeorg-petit|title=Why I Will Not Sign Another Change.org Petition Ever|publisher=[[Crooks and Liars]]|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Change.org was accused of encouraging [[astroturfing]] and abandoning the progressive user base from which it initially gained traction. Additional controversy arose when the employee who initially leaked the documents was fired.&lt;ref name="karoli" /&gt; Of the users who lost interest in the site after this change, a number of them expressed difficulty in being removed from Change.org mailing lists.&lt;ref name="kos" /&gt;

===Selling of personal data===
Change.org has also been accused of selling the personal data provided by the users to third-party companies that hire its services, gaining money at the expense of the users.&lt;ref name="changebiz"/&gt;

===Use for trending topics===
Topics for Change.org petitions have grown to include disagreement with the [[Academy Awards]] and removing milk from certain types of coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/food/dailydish/la-dd-starbucks-vegan-pumpkin-spice-latte-20130912-story.html|first=Jenn|last=Harris|title=First world problem: Vegans want Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Lattes too|publisher=[[LA Times]]|date=2013-09-12|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.tradical360.com/7-dumbest-change-org-petitions-ever-created/ |first=Becky |last=Radolf |title=The 7 Dumbest Change.org Petitions Ever Created |publisher=Tradical |date=2014-03-07 |accessdate=2014-12-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217055129/http://blog.tradical360.com/7-dumbest-change-org-petitions-ever-created/ |archivedate=2014-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of these petitions have been criticized for focusing on [[first world problems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/apartment-tenants-start-changeorg-petition-over-package-delivery-really-7428094|title=Apartment tenants start Change.org petition over package delivery. Really|first=Amy|last=Martyn|publisher=Dallas Observer|date=2015-07-24|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further debate over the content of petitions came in November 2014 when [[Martin Daubney]] called some of them "bizarre" and stated that the site was being used to promote censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11229136/Is-Change.org-just-a-weapon-of-censorship.html|first=Martin|last=Daubney|title=Is Change.org just a weapon of censorship?|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=2014-11-14|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Change.org communication director John Coventry defended the wide range of petitions, saying that "people make an informed choice in what they want to support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11230684/Its-wrong-to-accuse-Change.org-of-promoting-censorship.html|first=John|last=Coventry|title=It's wrong to accuse Change.org of promoting censorship|publisher=The Telegraph|date=2014-11-14|accessdate=2014-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week saw criticism alleging that petitions about the media receive more attention than petitions about "saving 'actual' lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://things-that-matter.net/2014/11/20/how-can-a-petition-to-get-a-misogamist-pick-up-artist-refused-entry-to-the-uk-get-158000-signatures-and-our-petition-to-stop-the-home-office-just-leaving-people-to-drown-gets-3000-go-figure/|first=Ewan|last=Nicholson|title=How can a petition to get a misogynistic pick-up artist refused entry to the UK get 158,000 signatures and our petition to stop the Home Office just leaving people to drown gets 3000?

'''Corruption in Italy''' is a major problem. In [[Transparency International]]'s annual surveys, Italy has consistently been regarded as one of the most corrupt countries in the Eurozone.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite web| last =Webb| first =Jonathan | title =Corruption In Italy Is Getting Worse, Says Supreme Court Judge| work =Forbes| date =Apr 25, 2016| url =https://www.forbes.com/sites/jwebb/2016/04/25/corruption-in-italy-is-getting-worse-says-supreme-court-judge/#4f2bfc957970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency International's 2017 Corruption Perception Index ranks the country 54th place out of 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017|title=Corruption Perception Index 2017|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corruption costs [[Italy]] a reported €60 billion a year, which amount to four percent of its GDP.

According to Transparency International's Global Corruption Barometer 2013, 89% of surveyed households consider political parties to be corrupt or extremely corrupt—ranking as the most corrupt institution in Italy. Furthermore, 64% of the surveyed households believe that the level of corruption has increased and 61% of surveyed households find government efforts in the fight against corruption to be ineffective&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.transparency.org/gcb2013/country/?country=italy|title=Italy 2013 - World's largest opinion survey on corruption - Transparency International|last=e.V.|first=Transparency International|website=www.transparency.org|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian culture has been described as being characterized by “an ambiguous attitude to graft.”&lt;ref name="indep"&gt;{{cite web| last =Day| first =Michael| title =Corruption in Italy 'worse than ever' as minister quits over links with gang accused of bribery| work =The Independent | date =Mar 20, 2015| url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/corruption-in-italy-worse-than-ever-as-minister-quits-over-links-with-gang-accused-of-bribery-10124024.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 ''[[Al Jazeera]]'' report noted that clientelism and graft have long been cornerstones of the country's political establishment,&lt;ref name="aljaz"&gt;{{cite web| last =Mammone | first =Andrea | title =Eternal Corruption in the Eternal City?| work =Al Jazeera| date =Sep 10, 2015| url =http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2015/9/eternal-corruption-in-the-eternal-city.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a ''[[Forbes]]'' contributor wrote in 2016 about “the deep-seated nature of unsavoury elements in both private and public sectors” in Italy.&lt;ref name="forbes" /&gt; “Many Italians,” maintained a 2010 report, have accepted corruption and poor governance as part of their lives.&lt;ref name="insider"&gt;{{cite web| last =Scaglia| first =Paul| title =Comment: Quake underlines Italy’s sad legacy of corruption| work =Italian Insider| date =Apr 9, 2010| url =http://www.italianinsider.it/?q=node/119}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2015 report challenged this generally accepted view, arguing that “corruption in Italy does not seem to be a cultural issue” and that Italians consistently believe corrupt practices are less acceptable than other European nations.&lt;ref name="open"&gt;{{cite web| last =Capussela| first =Andrea| title =Corruption in Italy: a resilient equilibrium| work =Open Democracy | date =May 9, 2015| url =https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/andrea-capussela-vito-intini/corruption-in-italy-resilient-equilibrium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Mafia]] plays a key role in both public and private corruption. Arising “out of business deals,” as ''Forbes'' put it, the Mafia historically “acted as a guarantor for contracts, when the judiciary was viewed as weak. Until relatively recent history, almost every deal in the country was enforced by a ‘man of honor.’”&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

One source has described the web of corruption involving politics, business, and the Mafia as “an unholy triangle,” adding that it could alternatively be seen as a rectangle, with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] being a fourth major participant in the web of corruption, owing to links between the Mafia and [[Vatican Bank]] and to “complex money laundering systems” involving banks that manage church funds.&lt;ref name=bizins&gt;{{cite web| last =Roe| first =Alex| title =Why Nothing's Changed Since The Huge Corruption Scandal That Hit Italy 20 Years Ago| work =Business Insider| date =Feb 21, 2012| url =http://www.businessinsider.com/why-nothings-changed-since-the-huge-corruption-scandal-that-hit-italy-20-years-ago-2012-2?IR=T&amp;IR=T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==
===L'Aquila earthquake===
{{Main|2009 L'Aquila earthquake}}
After a 1968 earthquake in [[Sicily]], most of the funds appropriated to replace housing went to “needless construction projects,” a fact that underscored the scale of Italian corruption and the influence of the Mafia. Similarly, the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, in which over 300 people died, was described as a “stark reminder to Italians of the risks they take by tolerating a corrupt political system.” Franco Barberi, head of an Italian committee assessing earthquake risks, alleged that anywhere where corruption had not undermined safety measures, a similar earthquake would have resulted in no fatalities.&lt;ref name=insider/&gt;

===Tangentopoli===
A 1992–94 corruption scandal called Tangentopoli (Bribe City), uncovered by the so-called [[Mani pulite]] (Clean Hands) investigation, “rocked Italy to its core” and brought down the First Republic. But the probes “fizzled out” and afterwards the bribery just got worse.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;&lt;ref name=bizins/&gt;{{Main|Mani pulite}}

The political impact of Mani Pulite remains the worst scandal of all modern Italy. The public outrage over the corruption led to “the sudden extinction" of five different political factions that had controlled Italy's government since 1946.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; A new political establishment took their place, but corruption resumed.&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

One target of the 1992 through 1994 corruption probes was [[Gianstefano Frigerio]], then a [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] MP. During 1992–94, he was the defendant in four trials; one case fell afoul of the statute of limitations, but in the remaining three cases he was found guilty. He managed to have his six-year prison sentence reduced, then turned into a community service sentence, wherein his public service in the Parliament had been deemed acceptable community service.&lt;ref name=open/&gt; He was then re-elected to parliament in 2001, and arrested again in 2014 for participation in the massive corruption scheme surrounding the Expo in Milan.&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

It is widely believed that two judges, Paolo Borsellino and Giovanni Falcone, were murdered in 1992 because of their efforts to punish corrupt ties between Mafia and politicians.&lt;ref name=bizins/&gt;

==Perceptions==
In 2012, 65% of Italians told Transparency International (TI) that they thought corruption had intensified during the previous three years.&lt;ref name=guard&gt;{{cite web| last =Davies| first =Lizzy| title = The six things wrong with Italy – and how to solve them| work =The Guardian| date =Feb 20, 2013| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/20/six-things-wrong-with-italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, Italian Supreme Court judge Piercamillo Davigo, who had prosecuted widespread political corruption in the 1990s, also expressed the view that corruption had grown worse since then. “The politicians haven’t stopped stealing, they’ve stopped being ashamed of it,” he said. “Now they blatantly claim a right to do what they used to do secretly.”&lt;ref name=forbes/&gt;

Nicola Gratteri, an anti-mafia prosecutor, shared Davigo's view that the level of political corruption had heightened. Gratteri noted that twenty years prior, it was common practice for mob bosses to ask politicians for favors, but in recent years the politicians have sought the aid of mob bosses in return for public contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Jones| first =Gavin| title =Italy judge's warning on political corruption triggers furor| work =Reuters| date =Apr 23, 2016| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-politics-justice-idUSKCN0XK0ER}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 report in ''The Guardian'' identified “Organised crime and corruption” as one of six problems currently facing Italy. The Mafia, once confined largely to the south, now operated nationwide, and had spread beyond [[drug trafficking]] and [[prostitution]] to [[transportation|transport]], [[healthcare|public health]], and other industries.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;'

Since 2000, Italy has experienced perceived corruption levels on par with Post-Soviet, Eastern European [[Transition economy|transition nations]].&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

==Government==
Italian public officials routinely have close ties to organized crime and to businesses.&lt;ref name=anti&gt;{{cite web| title =Italy Corruption Report| work =Business Anti-Corruption Portal| url =http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/italy/show-all.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italian citizens consider political parties and parliament itself to be the nation's two most corrupt institutions.&lt;ref name=local/&gt;

Corruption is common in Italy's public services sector. Doing business in Italy is complicated by inefficient government bureaucracies and burdensome rules, and almost half of Italians believe that the issuance of business permits involves bribes and abuse of power.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt; Because of corruption, it takes almost six years to complete a major public-works project in Italy, and such projects cost four times as much as elsewhere in Europe.&lt;ref name=insider/&gt;

In 2002, Berlusconi’s government “virtually abolished the crime of false accounting,” a move that caused a growth in corruption and Mafia crime.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

As of 2012, [[Filippo Penati]], a PD politician, was being investigated for corruption, specifically bribery. So was PdL party member [[Marco Milanese]], whose fellow party members in parliament managed to prevent his arrest.&lt;ref name=bizins/&gt;

Industry Minister [[Federica Guidi]] resigned in March 2016 when evidence emerged that she sought to help her boyfriend's business by helping to pass a certain budget amendment. Her boyfriend, Gianluca Gemelli, faced charges of corruption and influence peddling in the so-called Basilicata case.&lt;ref name=occrp&gt;{{cite web| title =Italy: Official Investigated In Growing Oil Corruption Scandal| work =OCCRP| date =Apr 14, 2016| url =https://www.occrp.org/en/daily/5132-italy-official-investigated-in-growing-oil-corruption-scandal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Silvio Berlusconi===
[[File:Silvio Berlusconi (2010) cropped.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Silvio Berlusconi]]
{{Main|Controversies surrounding Silvio Berlusconi}}

[[Silvio Berlusconi]], billionaire, media mogul, and prime minister of Italy for three periods (1994-5, 2001–6, and 2008–11), was frequently accused of corruption. His firms have been charged with such crimes as bribery and false invoicing, and Berlusconi himself has widely been rumored to have Mafia ties. In 2011, the [[U.S. State Department]] named Berlusconi as participating in the “commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child.” Convicted of tax fraud in 2012, he was removed from the Italian Senate after the Supreme Court confirmed the verdict the next year, but not imprisoned. In June 2013 he was found guilty of paying a teenage girl for sex, and of abusing his political power, but the verdict was overturned in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Silvio Berlusconi: Italy's once-untouchable prime minister| work =BBC| date =Jun 14, 2016| url =https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-11981754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public procurement===
The government procurement system is characterized by a high level of corruption. This is particularly true where infrastructure contracts are concerned. In such cases, the Mafia is very likely to be involved and favoritism will almost inevitably play a part in the awarding of contracts. In recent years, most of the high-profile corruption cases in Italy have involved government procurement. In 2015, one in three public contracts involved irregularities.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

Contracts for Expo 2015, a fair in [[Milan]], became the subject of a major anti-corruption investigation in which seven officials were arrested as of April 2015. [[Venice]]'s mayor and over 30 other public officials were arrested in 2015 for accepting bribes in exchange for building contracts.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt; In the same year, several businessmen were taken into custody on charges of belonging to “a gang involved in kickbacks and dodgy contracts” for high-speed rail lines, Expo 2015, a flood barrier in Venice, and other large-scale projects. Among those who had received kickbacks was Infrastructure and Transport Minister [[Maurizio Lupi]], who was forced to resign.&lt;ref name=indep/&gt;

===Judiciary===
The [[Judiciary of Italy|Italian courts]] are slow and inefficient. Almost half of citizens surveyed view the system as corrupt, and many think that bribes and abuse of power are common.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

===Police===
Experts view the [[Italian police]] as being relatively free of corruption and respectful of the law. About a third of Italians, however, consider the police to be corrupt.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

===Land administration===
There is a degree of corruption in Italian land administration. Over half of citizens think that officials issuing building permits commit bribery and abuse of power.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

===Tax system===
The tax system lacks transparency and involves considerable bribery. Most firms view the tax rates as problematic.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

===Customs service===
There is a degree of corruption in the customs system.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

==Financial sector==
{{Main|Bancopoli}}
The Bancopoli scandal of 2005–6 involved stock manipulation and insider trading. [[Antonio Fazio]], head of Italy's central bank, gave unfair advantage to [[Banca Popolare Italiana]] (BPI) in its struggle against the Dutch bank [[ABN AMRO]] for control of [[Banca Antonveneta]]. Fazio and other figures in the banking community were ultimately forced to resign, while the managing director of BPI was arrested and the bank's entire board of directors came under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Procura: deposizione del premier irrilevante|url=http://www.corriere.it/Primo_Piano/Politica/2006/01_Gennaio/25/unipol.shtml|work=Corriere della Sera|publisher=RCS Pubblicità SpA|accessdate=24 June 2012|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unipol, procura chiede archiviazione per le dichiarazioni di Berlusconi|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2006/a/sezioni/politica/affaripol3/archidic/archidic.html|work=La Repubblica.it|publisher=La Repubblica|accessdate=24 June 2012|language=Italian|date=25 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
{{Main|2006 Italian football scandal}}
In 2006, police investigators revealed that the managers of major Italian [[soccer]] teams had been colluding with friendly referees to rig games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6129251e-0de3-11db-a385-0000779e2340.html | title=Azzurri’s quest consoles nation rocked by scandals | publisher=Financial Times | author=Simon Kuper | date=2006-07-07 | accessdate=2006-07-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060715141908/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6129251e-0de3-11db-a385-0000779e2340.html| archivedate= 15 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rome==
[[File:Roma-palazzo dei senatori01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|The Senate Palace in Rome]]
Beginning in December 2014, ties between [[Rome|Roman]] politicians and the Mafia were made public by the municipal judiciary, which provided evidence of the widespread siphoning of public funds from projects involving “the managing of green areas, recycling, social housing and refugee reception centers.” Leading officials were shown to have received bribes in exchange for government contracts; former mayor [[Gianni Alemanno]] was among those investigated.&lt;ref name=aljaz/&gt;

In what has come to be called the [[Mafia Capitale investigation]], officials were accused of rigging contracts for the management of migrant centers in Rome. The scheme involved stealing millions of euros from the civic coffers. The city has continued to suffer because of this crime.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt; In mid 2015, several leading government and business figures were arrested in connection with the scandal.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

A June 2016 report in ''The Guardian'' noted that Rome mayoral candidate [[Virginia Raggi]] of the [[Five Star Movement]] (M5S) was doing well in polls because of her focus on “the corruption and cronyism of Italy’s mainstream parties.” In Rome, noted the newspaper, “establishment politicians and officials” were currently “on trial alongside alleged mobsters, charged with conspiring to pocket millions of euros from rigged public contracts.” Raggi has accused the political elite of creating “a pit of waste” and of “robb[ing] Rome” with their corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Scammell| first =Rosie| title =Rubbish on the streets, corruption in the air: Rome looks for a clean-up candidate| work =The Guardian| date =Jun 11, 2016| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/11/rome-mayoral-elections-raggi-corruption-five-star-movement}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“The level of corruption we are witnessing in Rome,” wrote one observer in 2015, “suggests that Italy needs a major change in mentality, a cultural revolution.”&lt;ref name=aljaz/&gt;

==Positive view of Italian corruption==
In 2001, British author and physician [[Theodore Dalrymple]] argued that corruption is actually the “one saving grace” of Italian public administration. Dalrymple explained his view that Italy's government was overburdened with an inefficient [[bureaucracy]] that slows down any progress but that corruption and bribery to bypass roadblocks allows for some progress to be made.&lt;ref name=dalry&gt;{{cite web| last =Dalrymple| first =Theodore| title =The Uses of Corruption| work =The City Journal| url =http://www.city-journal.org/html/uses-corruption-12180.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dalrymple further maintained that the open display of corruption on the part of government officials causes Italian citizens to view the government as the 'enemy', an attitude that Dalrymple considered sensible and healthy, as compared with the misguided British belief that the state is purely good. This belief, Dalrymple charged, “has completely eroded the proud and sturdy independence of the British population.”&lt;ref name=dalry/&gt;

==Anti-corruption efforts==
In a May 2015 article for [[Open Democracy]], Andrea Capussela and Vito Intini noted that Italy's anti-corruption efforts are inadequate and are not pursued with any enthusiasm. Since 1994, they explained, Italy has seen a series of laws passed that weakened the government's ability to combat corruption. For example, the statute of limitations was cut in half, procedural rules were made more complicated, and some corruption-related acts were decriminalized. A new anti-corruption law passed in 2012 did not reverse these laws, and is widely considered weak. Capussela and Intini asked explicitly: “why were such laws adopted and never reversed and how could the political élite get away with it?” This state of affairs was especially puzzling, they pointed out, since the struggle against corruption had often been high on the agenda of any rising politician for two decades.&lt;ref name=open/&gt;

The Italian Anti-Corruption Law of 2012 expanded the definition of corruption and enhanced transparency and disclosure requirements for public-sector workers. It also introduced “white lists” of suppliers, service providers, and construction firms that comply with anti-Mafia laws. In addition, it established the National Anti-Corruption Authority, which has the power to investigate corruption cases, and the National Anti-Corruption Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Cova| first =Bruno| title =How Italy has toughened its anti-corruption laws| work =Ethic Intelligence| url =http://www.ethic-intelligence.com/experts/351-how-italy-has-toughened-its-anti-corruption-laws-and-what-this-means-for-companies/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law banned persons convicted of corruption from running for public office, increased prison sentences for officials convicted of abuse of office or demanding bribes, increased penalties for private-sector corruption, and called for the institution of local anti-corruption plans and for greater transparency in hiring and budgets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Italy: Anti-Corruption Law Adopted| work =Library of Congress| url =https://www.loc.gov/law/foreign-news/article/italy-anti-corruption-law-adopted/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law criminalized influence-trading in both the public and private sectors, protected whistleblowers, and prohibited corrupt officials from holding certain administrative positions. But proper enforcement of the law continues to be complicated by a slow, overburdened judiciary.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

There are effective means of investigating police abuse and corruption, but the process is hampered by slow courts. The Code of Conduct of Public Officials includes detailed prescriptions involving transparency, conflicts of interest, and gifts. There are also Rules on Protocol Gifts that forbid gifts to public officials, who are required to report their assets.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

Italy is a signatory to the [[Council of Europe]]’s Civil and Criminal Law Conventions against Corruption , the [[United Nations Convention Against Corruption|UNCAC]], and the [[OECD]]'s Anti-Bribery Convention.&lt;ref name=anti/&gt;

[[Mario Monti]], prime minister from 2011 to 2013, sponsored a 2012 anti-corruption law that was described by TI as an insufficient “first step.”&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; In 2012, 64% of Italians described government anti-corruption efforts as ineffective.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Only 19 percent think such efforts are effective.&lt;ref name=local/&gt;

The Italian National Anti-Corruption Authority (ANAC) is an independent regulatory body set up in 2009. It is empowered to inspect offices and confiscate documents. In 2016, the ANAC and the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) announced a partnership to fight corruption throughout the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =OLAF and ANAC team up to tackle corruption in Italy and beyond| work =OLAF| date =Apr 20, 2016| url =https://ec.europa.eu/anti-fraud/media-corner/news/20-04-2016/olaf-and-anac-team-tackle-corruption-italy-and-beyond_en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">The '''economy of affection''' is term introduced by [[Göran Hydén]] to describe a network of interactions, communications and support among certain [[peasant]] groups in parts of East Africa. These groups, identified in terms of their relationship to structure, are united by [[kinship]], community, religion or other affinities. The functional purposes of this economy of affection involves survival, social maintenance, and development.

The kind of personal relationships and dependencies which form the basis for a [[subsistence economy]] in [[East Africa]] have been superseded by commercial or government services in the developed world. But in such sub-Saharan African villages, as studied by Hyden, their economies have not yet been 'captured' by [[capitalism]] and their peasantry remains unproletarianised. The key issue here for Hyden is that the "[[Value system|social values]]" of the [[Market (economics)|market]] are still underdeveloped. The East African [[peasant]]ry still is able to 'choose' to operate at least partially in the traditional morality-based economy and the true market system. This then explains why a rational response to market incentives might strengthen his position in the economy of affection.&lt;ref&gt;[[Göran Hydén|Hyden, G.]] (1980) Beyond Ujamaa in Tanzania: underdevelopment and an uncaptured peasantry, London. {{ISBN|0435963023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hyden, G.

Tony Waters believes that Hyden's model of the uncaptured peasantry can be used to describe other peasant situations such as North America's European frontier in the early 19th century, and Scotland in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, Tony.

The '''Empire of Liberty''' is a theme developed first by [[Thomas Jefferson]] to identify the responsibility of the United States to spread freedom across the world. Jefferson saw the mission of the U.S. in terms of setting an example, expansion into western North America, and by intervention abroad. Major exponents of the theme have been [[Abraham Lincoln]] (in the [[Gettysburg Address]]), [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] (and "[[Wilsonianism]]"), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], [[Harry Truman]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bill Clinton]],&lt;ref&gt;Hyland says, "Jefferson's concept of an empire of liberty found an echo in Clinton's enlargement of democracies." William Hyland, ''Clinton's world: remaking American foreign policy'' (1999) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George W. Bush]].

In the [[history of U.S. foreign policy]], the Empire of Liberty has provided motivation to fight the [[Spanish–American War]] (1898),&lt;ref&gt;Dominic Tierney, ''How We Fight: Crusades, Quagmires, and the American Way of War'' (2010) p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; World War I (1917),&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Immerman, ''Empire for Liberty'' (2010) p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; the later part of World War II (1941), the [[Cold War]] (1947–91) and the [[War on Terror]] (2001–present).&lt;ref&gt;David Reynolds, ''America, Empire of Liberty'' (2009) pp. xvii, 304, 458&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thomas Jefferson==
Jefferson used this phrase "Empire of Liberty" in 1780, while the American revolution was still being fought. His goal was an empire dedicated to liberty that could stop the growth of the British Empire, which he hated and feared: 

{{quote|We shall divert through our own Country a branch of commerce which the European States have thought worthy of the most important struggles and sacrifices, and in the event of peace [ending the American Revolution]...we shall form to the American union a barrier against the dangerous extension of the British Province of Canada and add to the Empire of Liberty an extensive and fertile Country thereby converting dangerous Enemies into valuable friends.|Jefferson to George Rogers Clark, 25 December 1780&lt;ref&gt;See [http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Empire_of_liberty online source]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Jefferson envisaged this "Empire" extending Westwards over the American continent, expansion into which he saw as crucial to the American future. During his Presidency, this was in part achieved by his 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase|purchase of the Louisiana Territory from the French]], almost doubling the area of the Republic and removing the main barrier to Westward expansion, stating that "I confess I look to this duplication of area for the extending of a government so free and economical as ours, as a great achievement to the mass of happiness which is to ensue".&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson to Dr. Joseph Priestley, 29 January 1804&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this was not necessarily a politically unified Empire. "Whether we remain in one confederacy, or form Atlantic and Mississippi confederacies, I believe not very important to the happiness of either part." &lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson to Dr. Joseph Priestley, 29 January 1804&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Jefferson on other occasions seemed to stress the territorial inviolability of the Union.

In 1809 Jefferson wrote his successor [[James Madison]]:

{{quote|we should then have only to include the North [Canada] in our confederacy...and we should have such an empire for liberty as she has never surveyed since the creation: &amp; I am persuaded no constitution was ever before so well calculated as ours for extensive empire &amp; self government.|Jefferson to James Madison, 27 April 1809}}

Even in his later years, Jefferson saw no limit to the expansion of this Empire, writing "where this progress will stop no-one can say. Barbarism has, in the meantime, been receding before the steady step of amelioration; and will in time, I trust, disappear from the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Jefferson to William Ludlow, 6 September 1824&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monroe Doctrine==
The [[Monroe Doctrine]], a U.S. foreign policy initiative introduced in 1823, states that efforts by European countries to colonize or interfere with states in the Americas will be viewed as acts of aggression requiring U.S. intervention. Its justification was to make the New World safe for liberty and American-style [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]], as well as prevent the further growth of European empires in the New World. The Monroe Doctrine was invoked against the takeover of Mexico by France (1860s) and Imperial Germany (see [[Zimmermann Telegram]]) in  1917. After 1960 the Monroe Doctrine was invoked to [[:wikt:roll back|roll back]] Communism from its new base in Castro's [[Cuba]]. [[Ronald Reagan]] emphasized the need to roll back Communism in [[Nicaragua]] and [[Grenada]].

==Reforming the world==
American Protestant and Catholic religious  activists began missionary work in "pagan" areas from the 1820s, and expanded operations worldwide in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Reeves-Ellington, Kathryn Kish Sklar and Connie A. Shemo, ''Competing Kingdoms: Women, Mission, Nation, and the American Protestant Empire, 1812–1960'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

European nations (especially Britain, France and Germany) also had missionary programs. The Europeans focused mostly on their own empires.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Porter, ''The Imperial Horizons of British Protestant Missions, 1880–1914'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  Americans went anywhere it was possible, and had no government funding.  The [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) and [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) were among the many groups involved in missionary work. Others included the student volunteer movement and the King's Daughters. Among Catholics, the three [[Maryknoll]] organizations were especially active in China, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Wiest, ''Maryknoll in China: A History, 1918–1955'' (1997) {{ISBN|0-87332-418-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious reform organizations joined in attempts to spread modernity and worked to fight the corrupting effects of ignorance, disease, opium and alcohol. For example, the World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WWCTU), a spinoff of the [[WCTU]], had both strong religious convictions and a commitment to international efforts to shut down the liquor trade.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Woman's World/Woman's Empire'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8078-1950-6}})&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1930s the more evangelical Protestant groups redoubled their efforts, but the more liberal Protestants had second thoughts about their advocacy, especially after the failure of prohibition at home cast doubt on how easy it might be to reform the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell, ''Reforming the World: The Creation of America's Moral Empire'' (Princeton University Press, 2010 {{ISBN|978-0-691-14521-1}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other dimensions==
Economic dimensions of the Empire of Liberty involved dissemination of American management methods (such as [[Taylorization]], [[Fordism]], and the [[assembly line]]), technology, and popular culture such as film.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Pells, ''From Modernism to the Movies: The Globalization of American Culture in the Twentieth Century'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, the Congress passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Acts]], which attempted to avoid entering in conflicts with other nations. The United States became involved in [[World War II]] two years after its start.

Writers on the Left often capitalized on anti-imperialism by using the label ''American Empire'' in a negative sense. [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Chalmers Johnson]] are prominent spokesmen for this position.&lt;ref&gt;Another Leftist, [[Arno J. Mayer]], once described the [[Roman Empire]] as a "tea party" in comparison to its American counterpart.&lt;br&gt;{{Cite web|author=Gabriele Zamparini; Lorenzo Meccoli|year=2003|title=XXI CENTURY, Part 1: The Dawn|url=http://www.bullfrogfilms.com/catalog/xxid.html|publisher=The Cat's Dream|at=[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDp_WeHMQjw&amp;t=47m04s 47:04]|quote=It [the American Empire] is an informal empire of the sort that, it seems to me, does not really have a precedent in history. I'm inclined to say that compared to the American Empire, even the Roman Empire may be said to have been something in the nature of a tea party.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their argument is that an America empire represents an evil, and indeed the very thing that the "Empire of Liberty" was conceived to counter, imperialism. They recommend dismantling the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers A. Johnson, ''Dismantling the Empire: America's Last Best Hope'' (American Empire Project) (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rican poet and novelist [[Giannina Braschi]] proclaims the collapse of the World Trade Center as the end of the American Empire and its colonial hold on Puerto Rico in her post 9-11 work "United States of Banana" (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Madelena Gonzales and Helene Laplace-Claverie, editors, ''Minority Theatre on the Global Stage: Challenging Paradigms from the Margins'', 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his victory in [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|legislative elections held on 25 January 2015]], the newly elected [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Alexis Tsipras]] appointed a new cabinet to succeed the [[Cabinet of Antonis Samaras|cabinet]] of [[Antonis Samaras]], his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Government announces the new ministerial cabinet|url=http://www.tovima.gr/en/article/?aid=671144|work=[[To Vima]]|date=27 January 2015|accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant reshuffle took place on 17 July 2015.

Tsipras resigned as Prime Minister on 20 August 2015, and after opposition parties failed to form their own government, on 27 August [[Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou]] was appointed as an interim Prime Minister, and her [[Caretaker Cabinet of Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou|caretaker cabinet]] was sworn in on 28 August. Following the subsequent [[Greek legislative election, September 2015|September legislative election]], Tsipras was re-appointed as Prime Minister on 21 September and appointed a [[Second Cabinet of Alexis Tsipras|second cabinet]] that was sworn in on 23 September.

==Composition of the cabinet==
The cabinet is composed of 35 members, alongside 6 deputy ministers. Including the deputy ministers the cabinet comprises 6 females and 35 males. It reflects the majority coalition in Parliament. It is composed of the winning [[Coalition of the Radical Left]] (SYRIZA) with the support of the right-wing anti-austerity party, [[Independent Greeks]] (ANEL). The [[Ecologist Greens]] (OP), which had withdrawn from the election in support of SYRIZA, were given the office of Alternate Minister of Environment and Energy. Finally, some ministers do not belong to any party.

==Oath of office==
Most members of the cabinet were sworn in on 27 January 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-30981950|publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Greece anti-bailout leader Tsipras made prime minister|date=26 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the exception of the new Minister of Justice [[Nikos Paraskevopoulos]] , who was sworn in a day later,&lt;ref name=oath&gt;{{cite web|title=New SYRIZA cabinet sworn in at the presidential mansion|work=Capital.gr|url=http://english.capital.gr/News.asp?id=2213361|date=28 January 2015|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Alternate Ministers [[Tasia Christodoulopoulou|Christodoulopoulou]], [[Christos Spirtzis|Spirtzis]] and Fotakis who were sworn in almost two months later.

While most representatives of Syriza chose a civil [[oath of office]], the ANEL representatives as well as [[Yiannis Panousis]], [[Dimitris Mardas]] and [[Panagiotis Nikoloudis]] chose a religious oath before a representative of the [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek orthodox]] Archbishop [[Ieronymos II of Athens]].&lt;ref name=oath /&gt;

 [[File:Timor-map.png|thumb|The island of Timor.]]
The '''[[Political union|unification]]''' (or re-unification) of '''[[East Timor]]''', an [[Sovereign state|independent state]], and '''[[West Timor]]''', a territory of [[Indonesia]], both parts of the island of [[Timor]], that share [[Timoric languages|language]] and [[Austronesian peoples|ethnicity]], has been raised since the mid-20th century. '''Great Timor''' ({{lang-id|Timor Raya}}) refers to the [[Irredentism|irredentist]] concept of a united and independent island of Timor, covering formerly [[Portugal|Portuguese]] East Timor and formerly [[Netherlands|Dutch]] (now Indonesian) West Timor.

Historically, the idea of uniting Timor Island had been expressed by several Timorese groups. The earliest reference point is the pre-colonial Empire of Wehali, whose center was in today's West Timor, but the ruling group was the Tetun speaking Belunese associated with the inhabitants of the Eastern Timor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Therik|first1=Tom|title=Wehali : the female land : traditions of a Timorese ritual centre|date=2004|publisher=Pandanus Books, in association with the Dept. of Anthropology, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies|location=Canberra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Japanese Occupation of the Island (1942–45), there were some Japanese and Timorese efforts to unite West and East Timor through match-making between the traditional authorities of Dutch and Portuguese Timor. Especially, [[:ja:前田透|Tōru Maeda]] (a Japanese intelligence agent, later poet, who served in Viqueque and Atambua) was instrumental in a matchmaking between the family of Don. Joaquim da Costa of Ossu and the Nai-Buti clan in Atambua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maeda|first1=Tooru|title=Chimoru-Ki|date=1982|publisher=Soudosha|location=Japan|pages=125–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1974–75, [[APODETI]], an East Timorese party expressed its will to integrate East Timor and West Timor through an integration into the Republic of Indonesia. This idea was reflected in the original Portuguese version of so-called Balibo Declaration in which the signatories lamented the separation with the "Indonesian people of Timor" through demarcation of the colonial borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xdata.bookmarc.pt/cidac/tl/PP0846-3.pdf|website=BookMarc|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

East Timor was [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|invaded]] and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupied]] by Indonesia in 1975, which annexed the territory as its "27th Province" in 1976, but in [[East Timorese independence referendum, 1999|a referendum held in 1999]], the people of East Timor voted to end [[Indonesia]]n occupation and become an independent state. This caused widespread anger among many Indonesian nationalists, particularly in the military.

In 2001 and 2002, before East Timor's independence, there were claims by the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces|Indonesian military]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etan.org/et2001c/december/16-22/18tni.htm etan.org]&lt;/ref&gt; and some commentators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejakartapost.com/special/os_24.asp The Jakarta Post] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218020426/http://www.thejakartapost.com/special/os_24.asp |date=2006-02-18 }} "There are even rumors of a Timor Raya (Great Timor) and while the Indonesian authorities have denied the existence of such a movement to unite East and West Timor, it should not ignore the possibility of such an idea. Again, it is Australia that would benefit greatly from a Timor Raya."&lt;/ref&gt; that this would inspire the secession of West Timor from Indonesia.

[[FRETILIN]]'s independence movement never laid claim to West Timor at any time, before the Indonesian invasion or thereafter. After the Recovery of Independence in 2001, the government of East Timor fully recognises Indonesia's existing boundaries as inherited from the [[Netherlands East Indies]].

'''''Guernica''''' ({{IPA-eu|ɡer'nika}}) is a large oil painting on canvas by [[Spain|Spanish]] artist [[Pablo Picasso]] completed in June 1937,&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"&gt;Richardson (2016)&lt;/ref&gt; at his home on Rue des Grands Augustins, in Paris. The painting, now in the [[Museo Reina Sofia]] in Madrid, was done with a palette of gray, black, and white, and is regarded by many art critics as one of the most moving and powerful anti-war paintings in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/pablo-picasso-9440021#surrealism |title=Pablo Picasso |website=Biography.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standing at {{convert|3.49|m|ftin|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|7.76|m|ftin|sp=us}} wide, the painting shows the suffering of people and animals wrenched by violence and chaos. Prominent in the composition are a gored horse, a bull, and flames.

The painting was created in response to the [[bombing of Guernica]], a [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] [[Guernica (town)|town]] in northern [[Spain]], by [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italian]] [[Military aircraft|warplanes]] at the request of the Spanish [[Spain under Franco|Nationalists]]. Upon completion, ''Guernica'' was exhibited at the Spanish display at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] (Paris International Exposition) in the 1937 World's Fair in Paris and then at other venues around the world. The touring exhibition was used to raise funds for Spanish war relief.&lt;ref name="Cohen_2003"/&gt; The painting became famous and widely acclaimed, and it helped bring worldwide attention to the [[Spanish Civil War]].

==Commission==
In January 1937, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] government commissioned Picasso to create a large [[mural]] for the Spanish display at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne]] at the [[1937 World's Fair]] in Paris. At the time, Picasso was living in Paris, where he had been named Honorary Director-in-Exile of the [[Prado Museum]]. He had last visited Spain in 1934 and never returned.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; His initial sketches for the project, on which he worked somewhat dispassionately from January until late April, depicted his perennial theme of the artist's studio.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; Immediately upon hearing reports of the 26 April bombing of Guernica, the poet [[Juan Larrea (poet)|Juan Larrea]] visited Picasso and urged him to make the bombing his subject.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; However, it was only on 1 May, having read [[George Steer]]'s eyewitness account of the bombing (originally published in both ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 28 April), that he abandoned his initial project and started sketching a series of preliminary drawings for ''Guernica''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Preston, Paul]] (2012) [https://books.google.com/books?id=LOpqVkAyFkAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Steer%27s+report+preston ''The Destruction of Guernica''. HarperCollins] At Google Books. Retrieved 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical context==
{{See also|Bombing of Guernica|Spanish Civil War|Spanish Civil War, 1937}}

===Bombing of 26 April 1937===
[[Guernica (town)|Guernica]] is a town in the province of [[Biscay]] in Basque Country. During the Spanish Civil War, it was regarded as the northern bastion of the Republican resistance movement and the center of Basque culture, adding to its significance as a target.&lt;ref name = Arhheim1973&gt;Arhheim, (1973) p. ???&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican forces were made up of assorted factions (Communists, Socialists, Anarchists and others) with differing goals, but united in their opposition to the Nationalists. The Nationalists, led by General Francisco Franco, sought a return to pre-Republican Spain, based on law, order, and traditional Catholic values.&lt;ref&gt;Barton (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 16:30 on Monday, 26 April 1937, warplanes of the [[Nazi Germany|German]] [[Condor Legion]], commanded by Colonel [[Wolfram von Richthofen]], bombed Guernica for about two hours. Germany, at this time led by Hitler, had lent material support to the Nationalists. Later, intense aerial bombardment became a crucial preliminary step in the [[Blitzkrieg|Blitzkrieg tactic]].&lt;ref name=Ray2006&gt;Ray (2006),168–171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arhheim1973/&gt;

In his journal for 30 April 1937, von Richthofen wrote:
{{quote|When the first Junkers squadron arrived, there was smoke already everywhere (from the VB [VB/88] which had attacked with 3 aircraft); nobody would identify the targets of roads, bridge, and suburb, and so they just dropped everything right into the center. The 250s toppled a number of houses and destroyed the water mains. The incendiaries now could spread and become effective. The materials of the houses: tile roofs, wooden porches, and half-timbering resulted in complete annihilation. Most inhabitants were away because of a holiday; a majority of the rest left town immediately at the beginning [of the bombardment]. A small number perished in shelters that were hit."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Oppler (1988), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other accounts state that the town's inhabitants were in fact congregated in the center of town, as it was market day, and when the bombardment commenced, were unable to escape because the roads were full of debris and the bridges leading out of town had been destroyed.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|right|thumb|Guernica in ruins, 1937]]
Guernica's location was at a major crossroads 10 kilometers from the front lines and between the front lines and Bilbao, the capital of Bizkaia ([[Biscay]]). Any Republican retreat towards Bilbao and any Nationalist advance towards Bilbao had to pass through Guernica. "During 25 April, many of the demoralized (Republican) troops from Marquina fell back on Guernica, which lay 10 kilometers behind the lines."&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (2006), 231&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfram von Richthofen's war diary entry for 26 April 1937 states, "K/88 [the Condor Legion bomber force] was targeted at Guernica in order to halt and disrupt the Red withdrawal which has to pass through here."  Under the German concept of tactical bombing, areas that were routes of transportation and troop movement were considered to be legitimate military targets, and tactical aircraft tended to operate just outside the range of friendly artillery; in the German mindset, Guernica was thus a major target in support of the Republican offensive. The following day, Richthofen wrote in his war diary, "Guernica burning."&lt;ref name="beevor233"&gt;Beevor (2006), 233.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Republican retreat towards Bilbao did pass through Guernica, before and after the bombing, and, as Beevor points out, "At Guernica the communist [[Rosa Luxemburg]] Battalion under Major Cristobal held back the nationalists for a time".&lt;ref name="beevor233"/&gt;

Guernica was a quiet village. The nearest military target of any consequence was a factory on the outskirts of the town, which manufactured various war products. The factory went through the attack unscathed. Thus, the motivation of the bombing was one of intimidation.

===Aftermath===
Because a majority of the town's men were away, engaged in fighting on behalf of the Republicans, the town at the time of the bombing was populated mostly by women and children.&lt;ref name=Preston2007&gt;Preston (2007).12–19.&lt;/ref&gt; These demographics are reflected in the painting because, as [[Rudolf Arnheim]] writes, for Picasso: "The women and children make ''Guernica'' the image of innocent, defenseless humanity victimized. Also, women and children have often been presented by Picasso as the very perfection of mankind. An assault on women and children is, in Picasso's view, directed at the core of mankind." Clearly, the Nationalists sought to demoralize the Republicans and the civilian population as a whole by demonstrating their military might on a town that stood for traditional Basque culture and innocent civilians.&lt;ref name=Arhheim1973/&gt;

After the bombing, the work of the Basque and Republican sympathizer and ''The Times'' journalist [[George Steer]] propelled this event onto the international scene and brought it to Pablo Picasso's attention. Steer's eyewitness account was published on 28 April in both ''The Times'' and ''The New York Times'', and on the 29th appeared in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', a French Communist daily. Steer wrote:

{{quote|Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basques and the centre of their cultural tradition, was completely destroyed yesterday afternoon by insurgent air raiders. The bombardment of this open town far behind the lines occupied precisely three hours and a quarter, during which a powerful fleet of aeroplanes consisting of three types of German types, Junkers and Heinkel bombers, did not cease unloading on the town bombs weighing from 1,000 lbs. downwards and, it is calculated, more than 3,000 two-pounder aluminium incendiary projectiles. The fighters, meanwhile, plunged low from above the centre of the town to machinegun those of the civilian population who had taken refuge in the fields."&lt;ref name=Preston2007/&gt;}}

While Picasso was living in Nazi-occupied Paris during World War II, one German officer allegedly asked him, upon seeing a photo of ''Guernica'' in his apartment, "Did you do that?" Picasso responded, "No, you did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Lubbock |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jan/08/highereducation.news |title=Review: Guernica by Gijs van Hensbergen &amp;#124; Books |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 March 2013 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The photographer [[Dora Maar]]—who had worked with Picasso since mid-1936, photographing his studio and teaching him the technique of [[photogram|cameraless photography]]—&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel (1980), p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; documented the stages ''Guernica'' went through on its way to completion. Apart from their documentary and publicity value, Maar's photographs "helped Picasso to eschew color and give the work the black-and-white immediacy of a photograph", according to [[John Richardson (art historian)|John Richardson]].&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; The work was painted using a matte house paint specially formulated at Picasso's request to have the least possible gloss,&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; and the American artist [[John Ferren]] assisted him in stretching the monumental canvas.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/john-ferren]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729100546/https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/john-ferren |date=29 July 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previously, Picasso had rarely allowed strangers into his studio to watch him work, but he admitted influential visitors to his studio to observe the progress of the painting, believing that the publicity to be gained would help the antifascist cause.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt;

As he worked on the mural, Picasso said: "The Spanish struggle is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody think for a moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call ''Guernica'', and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death."&lt;ref&gt;Tóibín (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

After 35 days of work, he finished the painting on 4 June 1937.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt;

==Composition==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2017}}
[[File:PicassoGuernica.jpg|thumb|470px|center]]
The scene is within a room where, on the left, a wide-eyed bull stands over a grieving woman who holds a dead child in her arms. The center of the painting is occupied by a horse falling in agony, as if it had just been run through by a spear or javelin. There is a large gaping wound in the horse's side.

Under the horse is a dead, dismembered, soldier. The hand of his severed right arm still grasps a shattered sword, from which a flower grows. The palm of the soldier's open left hand contains a stigmata, a symbol of martyrdom derived from the [[stigmata]] of Christ. A bare light bulb blazes in the shape of an evil eye over the suffering horse's head.

To the upper right of the horse, a frightened female figure, who seems to be witnessing the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. She carries a flame-lit lamp which is positioned close to the bare bulb.

From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming have replaced the tongues of the bull, the grieving woman, and the horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light can be seen.

On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.

Two "hidden" images formed by the horse appear in ''Guernica'':
* A human skull overlays the horse's body.
* A bull appears to gore the horse from underneath. The bull's head is formed mainly by the horse's entire front leg which has the knee on the ground. The leg's knee cap forms the head's nose. A horn appears within the horse's breast.The bull's tail forms the image of a flame with smoke rising from it, seemingly appearing in a window created by the lighter shade of gray surrounding it.

==Symbolism and interpretations==
Interpretations of ''Guernica'' vary widely and contradict one another. This extends, for example, to the mural's two dominant elements: the bull and the horse. Art historian Patricia Failing said, "The bull and the horse are important characters in Spanish culture. Picasso himself certainly used these characters to play many different roles over time. This has made the task of interpreting the specific meaning of the bull and the horse very tough. Their relationship is a kind of ballet that was conceived in a variety of ways throughout Picasso's career."

When pressed to explain the elements in ''Guernica'', Picasso said,

{{quote|...this bull is a bull and this horse is a horse... If you give a meaning to certain things in my paintings it may be very true, but it is not my idea to give this meaning. What ideas and conclusions you have got I obtained too, but instinctively, unconsciously. I make the painting for the painting. I paint the objects for what they are.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/a_nav/guernica_nav/gnav_level_1/5meaning_guerfrm.html ...questions of meaning], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series. Accessed 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''[[The Dream and Lie of Franco]]'', a series of narrative sketches Picasso also created for the World's Fair, [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] is depicted as a monster that first devours his own horse and later does battle with an angry bull. Work on these illustrations began before the bombing of Guernica, and four additional panels were added, three of which relate directly to the Guernica mural.

According to scholar Beverly Ray, the following list of interpretations reflects the general consensus of historians: "The shape and posture of the bodies express protest"; "Picasso uses black, white, and grey paint to set a somber mood and express pain and chaos"; "flaming buildings and crumbling walls not only express the destruction of Guernica, but reflect the destructive power of civil war"; "the newspaper print used in the painting reflects how Picasso learned of the massacre"; "The light bulb in the painting represents the sun"; and "The broken sword near the bottom of the painting symbolizes the defeat of the people at the hand of their tormentors".&lt;ref name=Ray2006/&gt;

Alejandro Escalona said, "The chaos unfolding seems to happen in closed quarters provoking an intense feeling of oppression. There is no way out of the nightmarish cityscape. The absence of color makes the violent scene developing right before your eyes even more horrifying. The blacks, whites, and grays startle you—especially because you are used to see war images broadcast live and in high-definition right to your living room."&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt;

In drawing attention to a number of preliminary studies, the so-called primary project,&lt;ref&gt;[[Werner Spies]]: Guernica und die Weltausstellung von 1937. In: Id.: Kontinent Picasso. Ausgewählte Aufsätze, Munich 1988, S. 63–99.&lt;/ref&gt; that show an atelier installation incorporating the central triangular shape which reappears in the final version of ''Guernica'', Becht-Jördens and Wehmeier interpret the painting as a self-referential composition in the tradition of atelier paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]]. In his ''chef d'oeuvre'', Picasso seems to be trying to define his role and his power as an artist in the face of political power and violence. But far from being a mere political painting, ''Guernica'' should be seen as Picasso's comment on what art can actually contribute towards the self-assertion that liberates every human being and protects the individual against overwhelming forces such as political crime, war, and death.&lt;ref&gt;See Becht-Jördens (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition==
===1937 Paris International Exhibition===
''Guernica'' was initially exhibited in July 1937 at the Spanish Pavilion at the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris International Exposition]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The Pavilion, which was financed by the Spanish Republican government at the time of civil war, was built to exhibit the Spanish government's struggle for existence contrary to the Exposition's technology theme. The Pavilion's entrance presented an enormous photographic mural of Republican soldiers accompanied by the slogan:

:We are fighting for the essential unity of Spain.
:We are fighting for the integrity of Spanish soil.
:We are fighting for the independence of our country and for
:the right of the Spanish people to determine their own destiny.

The display of ''Guernica'' was accompanied by a poem by [[Paul Éluard]], and the pavilion displayed ''[[The Reaper (Miró painting)|The Reaper]]'' by [[Joan Miró]] and ''[[Mercury fountain|Mercury Fountain]]'' by [[Alexander Calder]], both of whom were sympathetic to the Republican cause.

At its unveiling at the Paris Exhibition it garnered little attention. The public's reaction to ''Guernica'' was mixed.&lt;ref&gt;Witham (2013), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Aub]], one of the officials in charge of the Spanish pavilion, was compelled to defend the work against a group of Spanish officials who objected to the mural's modernist style and sought to replace it with a more traditional painting that was also commissioned for the exhibition, ''Madrid 1937 (Black Aeroplanes)'' by Horacio Ferrer de Morgado.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; Some Marxist groups criticized Picasso's painting as lacking in political commitment and faulted it for not offering a vision of a better future.&lt;ref&gt;Greeley, Robin A. (2006). ''Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War''. New Haven: Yale University Press. p. 241. {{ISBN|0300112955}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Morgado's painting was a great success with Spanish Communists and with the public.&lt;ref name="Richardson_2016"/&gt; The art critic [[Clement Greenberg]] was also critical of ''Guernica'', but for different reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Witham (2013), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; In a later essay, Greenberg termed ''Guernica'' "jerky" and "too compressed for its size", and compared it unfavorably to the "magnificently lyrical" ''[[The Charnel House]]'' (1944–48), a later antiwar painting by Picasso.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg (1993), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the painting's admirers were the art critic [[Jean Cassou]] and the poet [[José Bergamín]], both of whom praised the painting as quintessentially Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Leiris]] perceived in the painting a foreshadowing: "On a black and white canvas that depicts ancient tragedy ... Picasso also writes our letter of doom: all that we love is going to be lost..."&lt;ref&gt;Martin (2003), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===European tour===
''Guernica'', for which Picasso was paid 200,000 francs for his costs by the Spanish Republican government, was one of the few major paintings that were not sold directly from artist to his exclusive contracted [[art dealer]] and friend, [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7MbJ7bzsbo8C&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83 Van Hensbergen, Gijs (2005) ''Guernica'' p. 83 Bloomsbury Publishing] At Google Books. Retrieved 4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after its exhibition Rosenberg organised a four-man extravaganza [[Scandinavia]]n tour of 118 works by Picasso, [[Matisse]], [[Braque]] and [[Henri Laurens]]. The main attraction was ''Guernica'', and from January to April 1938 the tour visited [[Oslo]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg|Göteborg]]. In September 1938 the painting travelled to England, exhibited in [[London]]'s [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] organized by [[Roland Penrose]] with [[Clement Attlee]], where it arrived on 30 September 1938, the same day the [[Munich Agreement]] was signed by the leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and Germany. It then travelled onwards to [[Leeds]], [[Liverpool]] and in early 1939 [[Manchester]]. There, Manchester Foodship For Spain, a group of artists and activists engaged in sending aid to the people of Spain, exhibited the painting in the HE Nunn &amp; Co Ford automobile showroom for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-16927120 |title=BBC News – Picasso's Guernica in a car showroom |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=15 February 2012 |accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then returned briefly to France.

===American tour===
After the victory of Francisco Franco in Spain, the painting was sent to the United States to raise funds and support for Spanish refugees. The San Francisco Museum of Art (later [[SFMOMA]]) gave the work its first public, free appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. The [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City then mounted a Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940, entitled: ''Picasso: 40 Years of His Art'', that was organized by [[Alfred H. Barr]] in collaboration with the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The exhibition contained 344 works, including ''Guernica'' and its studies.&lt;ref&gt;Fluegel (1980), p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;

At Picasso's request the safekeeping of the piece was entrusted to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, as it was Picasso's expressed desire that the painting should not be delivered to Spain until liberty and democracy had been established in the country.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; Between 1939 and 1952, the painting traveled extensively in the United States; between 1953 and 1956 it was shown in [[Brazil]], at the first-ever Picasso retrospective in [[Milan]], Italy, and then in numerous other major European cities, before returning to MoMA for a retrospective celebrating Picasso's 75th birthday. It then went on to [[Chicago]] and [[Philadelphia]]. By this time, concern for the state of the painting resulted in a decision to keep it in one place: a room on MoMA's third floor, where it was accompanied by several of Picasso's preliminary studies and some of [[Dora Maar]]'s photographs of the work in progress. The studies and photos were often loaned for other exhibitions, but until 1981, ''Guernica'' itself remained at MoMA.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/treasuresoftheworld/guernica/glevel_1/gtimeline.html Timeline], part of a series of web pages on ''Guernica'' in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS's]] ''Treasures of the World'' series. Accessed 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Vietnam War]], the room containing the painting became the site of occasional anti-war vigils. These were usually peaceful and uneventful, but on 28 February 1974, [[Tony Shafrazi]]—ostensibly protesting Second Lieutenant [[William Calley]]'s petition for habeas corpus following his indictment and sentencing for the murder of 109 Vietnamese civilians during the [[My Lai massacre]]—defaced the painting with red spray paint, painting the words "KILL LIES ALL"; the paint was removed with relative ease from the varnished surface.&lt;ref name="Hoberman 2004"&gt;Hoberman 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment in Spain==
As early as 1968, Franco had expressed an interest in having ''Guernica'' come to Spain.&lt;ref name="timeline" /&gt; However, Picasso refused to allow this until the Spanish people again enjoyed a republic. He later added other conditions, such as the restoration of "public liberties and democratic institutions". Picasso died in 1973. Franco, ten years Picasso's junior, died two years later, in 1975. After Franco's death, Spain was transformed into a democratic [[constitutional monarchy]], ratified by [[Spanish Constitution of 1978|a new constitution]] in 1978. However, MoMA was reluctant to give up one of its greatest treasures and argued that a monarchy did not represent the republic that had been stipulated in Picasso's will as a condition for the painting's delivery. Under great pressure from a number of observers, MoMA finally ceded the painting to Spain in 1981. The Spanish historian [[Javier Tusell]] was one of the negotiators.

Upon its arrival in Spain in September 1981,&lt;ref name=uned/&gt; it was first displayed behind bomb-and bullet-proof glass screens&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8TO5wF6wUfoC&amp;pg=PA294 Van Hensbergen, Gijs (2005) ''Guernica'' p. 305.

[[File:Mural del Gernika.jpg|right|thumb|A tiled wall in Gernika claims ''"Guernica" Gernikara'', "The ''Guernica'' (painting) to Gernika."]]
In 1992, the painting was moved from the [[Museo del Prado]] to a purpose-built gallery at the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]], both in Madrid, along with about two dozen preparatory works.&lt;ref name=his&gt;[http://www.museodelprado.es/en/la-institucion/the-extension/el-cason-del-buen-retiro/historia/ The Casón del Buen Retiro: History] [[Museo del Prado]]. Retrieved 18 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This action was controversial in Spain, since Picasso's will stated that the painting should be displayed at the Prado. However, the move was part of a transfer of all of the Prado's collections of art after the early 19th century to other nearby buildings in the city for reasons of space; the Reina Sofía, which houses the capital's national collection of 20th-century art, was the natural place to move it to.
At the Reina Sofía, the painting has roughly the same protection as any other work.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;[http://www.picassoswar.com/interview.html Author interview] on Russell Martin's ''Picasso's War'' site. Accessed 16 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tapestry at the United Nations==

[[File:Guernica at the Whitechapel - geograph.org.uk - 1593698.jpg|thumb|The tapestry, at the [[Whitechapel Gallery]] in 2009]]

A full-size [[tapestry]] copy of Picasso's ''Guernica'', by {{ill|Jacqueline de la Baume Dürrbach|WD=Q32979529}},&lt;ref name="IPoG"&gt;{{Cite news |title=In praise of ...

It was displayed first from 1985 to 2009, and returned in 2015. It was commissioned in 1955 by [[Nelson Rockefeller]], since Picasso refused to sell him the original.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, Peter. [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2004/oct/03/art "A scream we can't ignore"], ''The Guardian'', 10 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry was placed on loan to the United Nations by the Rockefeller estate in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2009), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapestry is less monochromatic than the original and uses several shades of brown.

On 5 February 2003 a large blue curtain was placed to cover this work at the UN, so that it would not be visible in the background when [[Colin Powell]] and [[John Negroponte]] gave press conferences at the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; On the following day, it was claimed that the curtain was placed there at the request of television news crews, who had complained that the wild lines and screaming figures made for a bad backdrop, and that a horse's hindquarters appeared just above the faces of any speakers. Some diplomats, however, in talks with journalists claimed that the Bush Administration pressured UN officials to cover the tapestry, rather than have it in the background while Powell or other US diplomats argued for war on Iraq.&lt;ref name="Cohen_2003"&gt;Cohen (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In a critique of the covering, columnist Alejandro Escalona hypothesized that ''Guernica''{{'}}s "unappealing ménage of mutilated bodies and distorted faces proved to be too strong for articulating to the world why the US was going to war in Iraq", while referring to the work as "an inconvenient masterpiece."&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt;

On 17 March 2009, Deputy Spokesperson for the Secretary-General Marie Okabe announced that the ''Guernica'' tapestry had been moved to a gallery in London in advance of extensive renovations at UN Headquarters. The ''Guernica'' tapestry was the showcase piece for the grand reopening of the [[Whitechapel Gallery]]. It was located in the 'Guernica room' which was originally part of the old Whitechapel Library.&lt;ref&gt;Hensbergen (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the tapestry was on temporary loan to the [[San Antonio Museum of Art]] in [[San Antonio, Texas]] from the Rockefeller family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samuseum.org|title=San Antonio Museum of Art - Home|first=San Antonio Museum of|last=Art|website=Samuseum.org|accessdate=22 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, it was a symbol for Spaniards of both the end of the Franco regime and of [[Basque nationalism]]. The [[Basque National Liberation Movement|Basque left]] has repeatedly used imagery from the picture. An example is the organization [[Etxerat]] which uses a reversed image of the lamp as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Etxerat|url=http://www.etxerat.eus/index.php/eu/txostenak/hilabetekaria|publisher=Etxerat|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works inspired by ''Guernica'' include [[Goshka Macuga]]'s ''The Nature of the Beast'' (2009–2010), which used the Whitechapel-hosted [[Guernica (Picasso)#Tapestry at the United Nations|United Nations Guernica tapestry]]; ''The Keiskamma Guernicas'' (2010–2017); and Erica Luckert's theatrical production of ''Guernica'' (2011–2012).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Art and design historian Dr Nicola Ashmore curated an exhibition, ''Guernica Remakings'', at the [[University of Brighton]] galleries from 29 July 2017 to 23 August 2017.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

''Guernica'' has become a universal and powerful symbol warning humanity against the suffering and devastation of war.&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt; Moreover, the fact that there are no obvious references to the specific attack has contributed to making its message universal and timeless.&lt;ref name = "75years" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4547">The '''International Coalition to Ban Uranium Weapons''' (ICBUW) is a global coalition of 160 groups in 33 countries. It has three paid staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/i/10.html&lt;/ref&gt; ICBUW was formed in 2003 in [[Berlaar]], [[Belgium]]&lt;ref name="Stuart"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/r-b-stuart/radiation-du-and-burn-pit_b_593801.html | date = 28 May 2010 | accessdate = 13 November 2013 | first= R |last= Stuart | publisher = [[Huffington Post]] | title = Radiation, DU and Burn Pits -- Iraq's Cancer: "America's Gift That Keeps Giving"}}&lt;/ref&gt; to promote a campaign based on reliable information on depleted uranium (DU) weapons. It was{{when|date=March 2017}} based in Manchester, England.&lt;ref name="Stuart" /&gt;In 2018 the office has been transferred from Manchester to Berlin.

ICBUW campaigns for a ban on the use, transport, manufacture, sale and export of all conventional weapon systems containing uranium (usually called [[depleted uranium]] weapons). It also seeks health monitoring and compensation for communities affected by the use of uranium weapons and the [[environmental remediation]] of such sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/i/57.html About ICBUW]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lobbying ==
In advocating for a treaty ban on uranium weapons, ICBUW states that it is following the example of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] and the [[Cluster Munition Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/i/70.html About ICBUW]&lt;/ref&gt; ICBUW’s grassroots member organisations lobby at a national level, while ICBUW itself lobbies supranational bodies such as the [[European Parliament]] and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://newint.org/blog/editors/2007/11/15/depleted-uranium-developments/ | date = 15 November 2007 | accessdate = 12 November 2013 | last = Godrej| first = Dinyar | publisher =  [[New Internationalist]] | title = Depleted Uranium developments}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.theguardian.com/environment/earth-insight/2013/oct/13/world-health-organisation-iraq-war-depleted-uranium?CMP=twt_fd | date = 13 October 2013 | accessdate = 13 November 2013 | first= Nafeez |last= Ahmed | publisher = [[The Guardian]] | title = How the World Health Organisation covered up Iraq's nuclear nightmare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICBUW has prepared a draft Convention for a ban on depleted uranium weapons.&lt;ref name=ICBUW-DT&gt;Staff. [http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/a/2.html Draft Convention on the prohibition of development, production, stockpiling, transfer and use of uranium weapons and on their destruction] on the website of [http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/i/57.html ICBUW]&lt;/ref&gt; ICBUW's Draft Convention contains a general and comprehensive prohibition of the development, production, transport, storage, possession, transfer and use of uranium ammunition, uranium armour-plate and of any other military use of uranium. The Convention also outlines obligations concerning the abolition of uranium weapons and the destruction of uranium weapons construction facilities. In addition it obliges states to ensure a rapid decontamination of radioactive battlefields and test ranges, emphasising the protection of, and assistance to, civilians living in these areas and obliges states to compensate the victims.&lt;ref name=ICBUW-DT/&gt;

==Media==
In 2011, ICBUW released an animated short film developed in cooperation with Dutch [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) '[[Pax Christi|IKV Pax Christi]]'. ''When the Dust Settles'' outlines ICBUW's position and calls for a precautionary approach to the weapons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/a/374.html When the Dust Settles&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ICBUW and Dutch NGO IKV Pax Christi launched the Toxic Remnants of War Project which aims to consider and quantify the detrimental impact of war, military operations and munitions on the environment and human health, with particular focus on the release of toxic materials during military activities.

'''James Conley Justice II''' (born April 27, 1951) is an American coal mining and agriculture businessman and politician serving the [[List of Governors of West Virginia|36th]] and current [[List of Governors of West Virginia|Governor of West Virginia]] since 2017. With a net worth of around $1.9 billion, he is the wealthiest person in [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/jim-justice-ii/#4c5e903e7fe6|title=Jim Justice, II.|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He inherited a coal mining business from his father and successfully built a massive business empire with over 50 companies, including [[The Greenbrier]], a luxury resort. Justice is one of the few billionaires from the State of West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wvmetronews.com/2015/01/13/photo-gallery-west-virginia-coasts-to-blowout/a/|title=A West Virginia dancer performs during the first half at the WVU Coliseum.|date=January 14, 2015|website=WV MetroNews|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Justice switched from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and announced his candidacy for Governor in the [[West Virginia gubernatorial election, 2016|2016 election]]. He ran as a Democrat and defeated the Republican nominee, [[Bill Cole (politician)|Bill Cole]]. Less than seven months after taking office, Justice switched back to the Republican Party the day after announcing his plans at a [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump|Trump]] rally in the state.

==Early life==
James Conley Justice II was born in Charleston, the son of James Conley Justice and Edna Ruth (née Perry) Justice. Justice grew up in [[Raleigh County, West Virginia]]. He enrolled at the [[University of Tennessee]] on an [[athletic scholarship]] for [[golf]], but transferred to [[Marshall University]]. At Marshall, he was a two-year captain on the [[Marshall Thundering Herd|Thundering Herd]] golf team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houvouras|first=Jack|date=Winter 2010|title=HQ&amp;A with Jim Justice |url=http://www.huntingtonquarterly.com/articles/issue72/hqa.php|journal=Huntington Quarterly|location=Huntington, WV|publisher=HQ Publishing|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned his [[bachelor's degree]] and [[Master in Business Administration]] from Marshall.&lt;ref name=wapo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/wva-billionaire-jim-justices-mission-to-restore-the-greenbrier-resort/2011/02/09/AB5NO5M_story.html|title=W.Va. billionaire Jim Justice's mission to restore the Greenbrier resort|work=[[Washington Post]]|first=Neely|last=Tucker|date=March 6, 2011|accessdate=July 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business career==
After college, Justice went into the family agriculture business.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; Justice founded Bluestone Farms in 1977, which now operates {{convert|50,000|acre}} of farmland, and is the leading producer of grain on the [[East Coast of the United States]]. During that time, he also developed Stoney Brook Plantation, a 15,000-acre hunting and fishing preserve in [[Monroe County, West Virginia|Monroe County]]. Justice is a seven time national corn growing champion.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20151104/GZ01/151109764/1419|title=Justice stresses big ideas over specifics in campaign |last=Gutman|first=David|website=Charleston Gazette-Mail|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of his father in 1993, Justice inherited ownership of Bluestone Industries and Bluestone Coal Corporation.

In 2009, he sold some of his coal business to the Russian company [[Mechel]] for $568 million. In 2015, after a huge drop in the price of coal which led Mechel to close some of the mines, he bought the business back for just $5 million.&lt;ref name="wv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-01-10/can-west-virginia-s-new-governor-save-coal-country|title=Can West Virginia's New Governor Save Coal Country?|last=Barrett|first=Paul|date=January 10, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since buying back the mine from Mechel, Justice re-opened several of the mines and hired over 200 coal miners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Justice to put 200 miners back to work|url=http://www.timeswv.com/news/justice-to-put-miners-back-to-work/article_5250c5de-13d7-11e5-8b82-fb371a724c0f.html|website=Times West Virginian|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice's mining companies have a history of safety violation and unpaid taxes; in 2016, ''[[NPR]]'' called him the "top mine safety delinquent" in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/07/496696292/billionaire-gubernatorial-candidate-owes-15-million-in-taxes-and-fines|title=Billionaire Gubernatorial Candidate Owes $15 Million In Taxes And Fines|last=Berkes |first=Howard|website=NPR.org|access-date=August 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice owes millions of dollars to the government in back taxes, and unpaid coal mining fees and fines: "His mining companies owe $15 million in six states, including property and minerals taxes, state coal severance and withholding taxes, and federal income, excise and unemployment taxes, as well as mine safety penalties, according to county, state and federal records."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/07/496696292/billionaire-gubernatorial-candidate-owes-15-million-in-taxes-and-fines|title=Billionaire Gubernatorial Candidate Owes $15 Million In Taxes And Fines|publisher=|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice serves as the owner or [[chief executive officer]] of over 50 companies, including [[The Greenbrier]] in [[White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia]], which he bought for $20.5&amp;nbsp;million in 2009, preventing its [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref name="wv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvgazette.com/article/20150511/GZ01/150519885?hootPostID=abd4e9a79a984c6f9e8b1befd5519cd8|title=Greenbrier owner Jim Justice enters governor's race|work=[[The Charleston Gazette]]|last=Eyre|first=Eric|date=May 11, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Justice first took control he immediately brought back all 650 laid-off employees. He added vacation and health benefits to their contracts and offered a 10 percent raise if the hotel regained its fifth star.&lt;ref name="greenbrier"&gt;{{Cite news|title=W.Va. billionaire Jim Justice's mission to restore the Greenbrier resort|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/wva-billionaire-jim-justices-mission-to-restore-the-greenbrier-resort/2011/02/09/AB5NO5M_story.html|newspaper=The Washington Post |date=February 9, 2011|accessdate=November 11, 2016|issn=0190-8286|first=Neely|last=Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justice is in the process of building a new mountain top golf course with golfers [[Jack Nicklaus]], [[Gary Player]], and [[Lee Trevino]]. [[Arnold Palmer]] was involved before his 2016 death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Justice lures golf legends to build mountaintop course near Greenbrier |url=http://www.wvgazettemail.com/article/20150621/GZ02/150629839/2003120916#sthash.elNd4DYo.dpuf |website=Charleston Gazette-Mail|accessdate=January 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Forbes]] estimates Justice's net worth at $1.6&amp;nbsp;billion, making him the richest man in [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref name="saints"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/saints/2014/07/24/new-orleans-saints-training-camp-jim-justice/13134225/ |title=Billionaire Jim Justice gives Saints lavish training camp|first=Jim|last=Corbett|date=July 24, 2014|work=USA Today |accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Governor of West Virginia===
[[File:Jim Justice 2017 InaugurationHighlights PB-74 (32406322245).jpg|thumb|Justice at his inauguration]]
Justice took office as governor on January 16, 2017.

To improve West Virginia's budget situation, he has proposed raising the state's revenue by $450 million, primarily by increasing the consumer sales tax, reinstituting the [[business and occupation tax|business and occupation (B &amp; O) tax]], and establishing a "rich man's" tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2017/04/13/justice-vetoes-budget-by-unveiling-bull-manure/ |title=Justice vetoes budget by unveiling bull manure |publisher=West Virginia MetroNews Network |first=Jeff |last=Jenkins |date=April 13, 2017 |accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also opposed plans to cut health and education spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/01/us/jim-justice-west-virginia-governor.html|title=West Virginia's Governor, an 'Unusual Democrat,' Fights a G.O.P.

On August 3, 2017, Justice announced that he had rejoined the Republican Party. He made the announcement at a [[Donald Trump]] rally in [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] and also confirmed his support for the sitting [[President of the United States|President]]. Justice said that he was returning to the GOP because he could not help Trump as a Democrat. The announcement came as a surprise to his own staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kabler|first=Phil|date=August 3, 2017 |title=WV Gov.

==== Economic Policy ====
Justice campaigned and has governed with support for the coal industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/03/trump-praises-west-virginia-governor-coal-241313|title=Trump: Praise for Justice and coal|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not support raising taxes, but has supported increasing teachers' salaries arguing that increased state revenue will pay for the increased budget spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2018/01/10/new-spending-proposals-and-a-tax-cut-on-governor-justices-plate-this-year/|title=WV MetroNews  – New spending proposals and a tax cut on Governor Justice’s plate this year|website=wvmetronews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Justice said that he opposed budget cuts and supported raising sales taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2018/05/04/governor-justice-highlights-state-revenue/|title=WV MetroNews  – Governor Justice highlights improving state revenue|website=wvmetronews.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fiscally conservative [[Cato Institute|CATO Institute]], gave Justice an 'F' grade based on their positions, but Justice voiced his disagreement with the rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/politics/justice-dismisses-f-on-cato-institute-report-card-on-fiscal/article_5587ddce-938c-5c72-9975-a70ec661317b.html|title=Justice dismisses 'F' on Cato Institute report card on fiscal policy|last=writer|first=Phil Kabler Staff|work=Charleston Gazette-Mail|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Social Policy ====
On abortion, Justice had said that he does not support abortion, but that the Supreme Court had decided the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Governor/Jim_Justice_Abortion.htm|title=Jim Justice on Abortion|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Justice attended an anti-abortion, or [[Anti-abortion movements|pro-life]], rally supporting Amendment 1, a state constitutional amendment intended to ban abortion if [[Roe v.

==Opinion about global warming==
According to the ''[[Charleston Gazette-Mail|Charleston Gazette–Mail]]''[[Charleston Gazette-Mail|,]] Justice has equivocated on the scientific consensus on [[global warming]]. In an interview with the paper, he said: "There's documentation that would give one concern, and I don't think you should ignore that," he said. "At the same time, I think there's an awful lot of research that still should be done. [...] I surely wouldn't sit here and say I am a believer in global warming, but I wouldn't sit here and say that I am not concerned."&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Jim and Cathy Justice.jpg|thumb|Jim and Cathy Justice]]
Justice lives in [[Lewisburg, West Virginia]]. He met his wife, Cathy (''[[née]]'' Comer) in high school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.governor.wv.gov/about/Pages/default.aspx|title=About Jim|website=www.governor.wv.gov|accessdate=August 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two children, Jay and Jill.&lt;ref name=wapo/&gt; He stands at 6 feet and 7 inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.successfulmeetings.com/Strategy/Meeting-Strategies/James-C--Justice-II,-West-Virginia-s-Gentle-Giant/|title=James C.

Justice is a lifelong fan of the [[New Orleans Saints]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), and spent $30&amp;nbsp;million to develop a training facility for the team to use in 2014 at [[The Greenbrier]].&lt;ref name=wv/&gt;&lt;ref name=saints/&gt; He hosts the [[Greenbrier Classic]], a [[PGA Tour]] event, at The Greenbrier annually.&lt;ref name=wv/&gt;

Having lived in Lewisburg since 2001, he has been the girls basketball coach at [[Greenbrier East High School]] since 2003, having won the state championship in 2012. In 2011, he also became the head coach for the boys basketball teams, a position from which he stepped down in September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvva.com/story/36370290/2017/09/Thursday/gov-justice-will-no-longer-coach-high-school-boys-basketball|title=Gov.

I'm excited about it."

He has been director of the Mountain State Coal Classic since 1995. The basketball classic has enjoyed tremendous success awarding hundreds of thousands in scholarships and direct support to participating schools.

'''Land agent''' may be used in at least three different contexts.

Traditionally, a land agent was a managerial employee who conducted the business affairs of a large [[estate (house)|landed estate]] for a member of the [[landed gentry]],&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite web| url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/land%2Bagent|title= Land Agent|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; supervising the farming of the property by farm labourers and/or tenants and collecting rents or other payments. In this context a land agent was a relatively privileged position and was a senior member of the estate's staff. The older term, which continued to be used on some estates, was [[Steward (office)|steward]], and in Scotland a land agent was usually referred to as a [[Factor (Scotland)|factor]]. Today the term [[estate manager]] or similar is more common.

== Other uses ==
A land agent, also called a warrant agent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesrider.com/2009/07/12/scrip-warrant-act-of-1855/|title=Scrip Warrant Act of 1855|last=|first=|date=12 July 2009|publisher=The Spokesrider|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, may also be a [[Real estate broker|real estate agent or broker]] who specialises in land and farm sales.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt; Land and farm sales differ drastically from sales of houses, therefore there is the need for specialisation. This usage is found in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/licensing/landagents/definition.html|title=Land Agent|publisher=Government of South Australia|accessdate=September 20, 2018|deadurl=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510193541/http://www.ocba.sa.gov.au/licensing/landagents/definition.html|archivedate=May 10, 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land agent can also be an agent of the oil and mining industry who negotiates with landowners for mineral and surface rights for the potential extraction of those minerals. This usage is primarily found in the United States and in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002241 |title=Land agent: occupational profile |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Alberta learning information service |publisher=Government of Alberta|access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Canadian jurisdiction of the [[Northwest Territories]], a land agent is an employee of the federal department of [[Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada|Indigenous and Northern Affairs]] tasked with guiding through the application process individuals wishing to purchase or lease [[crown land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-INTER-NWT/STAGING/texte-text/clg11_1313789529697_eng.pdf |title= Your Guide to Who Manages Crown Land in the Northwest Territories|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website=Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada|publisher= |access-date= |quote=|type=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Feminism sidebar |lists}}

This is a '''list of important participants in the development of [[feminism]]''', originally sorted by surname within each period.

It may include, for instance, earlier authors who did not self-identify as feminists but have been claimed to have furthered "feminist consciousness" by a resistance of male dominance expressed in their works.
&lt;!-- Please insert alphabetically by surname within each period. --&gt;
&lt;!-- Please put country of main activity or residence first (for sorting) --&gt;
&lt;!-- Reliable sources should be added in order to establish notability as important participant in the development of feminism --&gt;

== Early feminists ==
Born before 1500.

The  '''Macaulay Institute''', formally the '''Macaulay Land Use Research Institute''' and sometimes referred to simply as '''The Macaulay''' is a research institute based at [[Aberdeen]] in [[Scotland]], which is now part of the [[James Hutton Institute]]. Its work covers aspects such as [[landscape]], [[soil conservation|soil]] and [[water conservation]] and [[climate change]].

==History==
The '''Macaulay Institute for Soil Research''' was founded in 1930. A benefaction of £10,000 from one of Canada's Scottish sons, [[Thomas Bassett Macaulay]], of the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] was used to purchase 50 acres and buildings at Craigiebuckler in Aberdeen.&lt;ref name="Herald 11Apr1986"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=crVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5781%2C2594642 |title=Institute transfer snag |first=Thomas |last=McConnell |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=11 April 1986 |page=7 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Macaulay's aim was to improve the productivity of Scottish agriculture. Thomas Bassett Macaulay was a descendant of [[Macaulay family of Lewis]], who were centred on the [[Hebridean]] island of [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]]. He was true to his Hebridean roots throughout his life, often giving large donations to Lewis, which funded various projects including a new library and a new wing at Lewis hospital.

The new Macaulay Institute opened on a site near Bucksburn in April 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wPs9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=M0kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5133%2C552905 |title=West College chief given new post |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=2 December 1986 |page=26 |accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed by the merger of the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research and the Hill Farm Research Organisation.&lt;ref name="Herald 11Apr1986"/&gt; The proposed merger was announced in December 1985 with the government anticipating that it would result in cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=abdAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xqUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4551%2C2778929 |title=Research to undergo radical changes |work=The Glasgow Herald |date=13 December 1985 |page=2 |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established to carry out research in support of the agricultural industry, taking account of the interaction between the industry and other land users, and set in the context of the environmental objectives of the [[UK Government]] and the [[European Union]].

In April 2011, the Macaulay Institute merged with [[Scottish Crop Research Institute|SCRI (Scottish Crop Research Institute)]] in Dundee to form the [[James Hutton Institute]]. The [[chief executive]] of the new institute is Professor Iain Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macaulay.ac.uk/newinstitute/ |title=New Institute, SCRI Macaulay merger |accessdate=29 October 2010 |last= |first= |coauthors= |year=2009 |work= |publisher=The Macaulay Land Use Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
It is an international centre for research and consultancy on the environmental and social consequences of rural land uses. Interdisciplinary research across the environmental and social sciences aims to support the protection of natural resources, the creation of integrated [[land use]] systems, and the development of sustainable rural communities.

With an annual income from research and consultancy of over £11million, the Macaulay Institute is the largest interdisciplinary research organisation of its kind in [[Europe]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

It is one of the main research providers to the [[Scottish Government]] and currently about 75% of the Macaulay's income is related to commissioned research programmes, principally on "Land Use and Rural Stewardship". The 300 staff and postgraduate students are drawn from over 25 countries, and conduct research in Scotland, across Europe and internationally, with a wide range of partner organisations. Their goal is that the research they undertake provides evidence that will help shape future environmental and rural-development policy both in Scotland and internationally.

The Macaulay Land Use Research Institute was a [[Charitable organization|registered charity]] since 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oscr.org.uk//charities/search-scottish-charity-register/charity-details?charitynumber=SC011922 |title=Scottish charity SC011922 |publisher=Scottish Charity Register |accessdate=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial services are delivered through Macaulay Scientific Consulting Ltd, its subsidiary consultancy company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110517204153/http://www.macaulayscientific.com/ Macaulay Scientific Consulting Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manuel Fal Conde, 1st Duke of Quintillo''' (1894–1975) was a Spanish Catholic activist and a [[Carlist]] politician. He is recognized as a leading figure in the history of Carlism, serving as its political leader for over 20 years (1934–1955) and heading the movement during one of its most turbulent periods. Initially he led the belligerent faction pressing anti-Republican insurgency; during the [[Spanish Civil War]] he joined the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]]; later on he championed anti-Francoist strategy.

==Family and youth==
[[File:SierraDeAracena-P1040876.JPG|thumbnail|left|[[Sierra de Aracena]], [[Huelva province]]]]
Manuel Lorenzo José Fal Conde descended from a petty [[bourgeoisie]] family originating from [[Asturias]];&lt;ref&gt;[Ana Marín Fidaldo, Manuel M. Burgueño], ''In memoriam. Manuel J. Fal Conde (1894-1975)'', Sevilla 1978, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; it is not clear when the family settled in [[Higuera de la Sierra]], a small town in the [[Andalusia]]n [[province of Huelva]]. Although many of his ancestors were connected with medicine,&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Fal Vázquez (born 1783), José Fal Vázquez (b. 1788), Manuel Fal Reyes (b. 1818), Juan Fal Reyes (b. 1817), Juan Fal Sánchez (b. 1849), Rafael Lancha Fal (b. 1885), Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; his father, Domingo Fal Sánchez (1857-1926),&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; was referred to as "agricultor y industrial", who owned a small workshop producing cork utilities&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and served as [[alcalde]] of Higuera between 1900 and 1905;&lt;ref&gt;''Alcaldes que rigieron el ayuntamiento de Higuera de la Sierra'', [in:] ''Inquietudes y vivencias de un sexagenario'' blog 25.10.13, available [http://inquietudesyvivencias.blogspot.com/2013/10/alcaldes-que-rigieron-el-ayuntamiento.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; also later on Domingo Fal exercised influence on Higuera's life.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1918 he launched Cabalgata de Reyes, the second oldest cabalgata in Spain, ''Higuera de la Sierra espera unas 35.000 visitas a su Cabalgata de Reyes en su 96 aniversario'', [in:] ''lainformacion.com'' service 03.01.14, available [http://noticias.lainformacion.com/estilo-de-vida-y-tiempo-libre/turismo/higuera-de-la-sierra-espera-unas-35-000-visitas-a-su-cabalgata-de-reyes-en-su-96-aniversario_IwkJgzO260fUUiWNc9N5Q6/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; He married a local girl, María Josefa Conde;&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; the couple lived in a building housing also the workshop. They had 4 children, Manuel was the youngest and his mother died 13 days after giving birth.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; The widowed sister of Domingo helped to look after the children, brought up in fervently Catholic ambience.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuel commenced his education in the [[Extremadura]]n town of [[Villafranca de los Barros]]. He entered the local [[Jesuit]] college&lt;ref&gt;founded in 1893, see ''Historia'' [in:] ''Colegio San José'' service, available [http://www.sanjosecolegio.com/index.php?id=10&amp;zona=quienes&amp;marca=enlace_25 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and joined his two older brothers already being educated there.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The Jesuit education proved crucial in Manuel's formative years. It was Gabino Márquez, the Villafranca scholar of biblical studies, papal teaching and pedagogy,&lt;ref&gt;compare ''abebooks'' service available [http://www.abebooks.com/book-search/author/gabino-marquez-p/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; who paid particular attention to the student, who he considered promising.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Following bachillerato obtained in 1911&lt;ref&gt;with excellent marks, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; the young Fal entered the Jesuit [[novitiate]], but he changed his mind some time afterwards, and considered studying medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; His father dissuaded him as his older brother, Domingo, was already pursuing that path;&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20. For his work as a doctor Domíngo was later recognized by the Higuera community by the naming of a major street after him&lt;/ref&gt; eventually Manuel commenced law studies in [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sevila19.JPG|thumbnail|160px|[[University of Seville]]]]
At [[University of Seville|Universidad Hispalense]] Fal was drawn to a circle of Manuel Sanchez de Castro,&lt;ref&gt;Leandro Alvarez Rey, ''La derecha en la II República: Sevilla, 1931-1936'', Sevilla 1993, {{ISBN|9788447201525}}, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; a Carlist, catedratic of natural law and moving spirit behind the emergence of militant Catholicism in Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20. compare José Calvo Gonzalez, ''Restauración tomista y catolicismo militante en la Universidad de Sevilla (1884-1924''), [in:] ''Anuario de filosofia del derecho'' 6 (1989), pp. 377-395&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated as licenciado in 1916; following a year in [[Madrid]] he obtained the grade of a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 21; not correspondent to the current PhD, in the Spanish education system of the time the title enabled to teach in colleges&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he served as soldado [[:es:Militarismo en España|de cuota]]&lt;ref&gt;in 9. Regimiento de Infanteria of Soria, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1918 he entered Colegio de Abogados de Sevilla.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Following brief internship Fal opened his own office at calle José Gestoso.&lt;ref&gt;below the apartment occupied by his cousin Rafael Fal, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel to his law practice Fal commenced also his brief teaching and academic career. He taught history and law and ethics at the Jesuit college of Villasis in Seville.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 21-22, Alvarez Rey 1993, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; At Universidad Hispalense he worked at department of derecho procesal, at the same time pursuing research in history of Spanish political law.&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez Rey 1993, p. 135, Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 21-22&lt;/ref&gt; He also briefly managed a car dealership.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1922 Fal married María de los Reyes Macias Aguilar (1904-1975),&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 14.07.77, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1977/07/14/069.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; a native of nearby [[Sanlúcar la Mayor|Sanlucar]].&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The newlyweds initially settled in Seville at calle Miguel del Cid.&lt;ref&gt;though in 1952, following death of his older brother, Fal inherited the family house in Higuera, he and his wife have always resided in Seville, living at 6 different locations, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had 7 children,&lt;ref&gt;José María, Mari Pepa, Domingo, Teresa, Alfonso Carlos, Javier and Pilar, see ''ABC'' 29.05.75, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1975/05/29/093.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; born between 1923 and 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 22-24, 30, 46-47; 1923 (José María), 1926 (María Pepa), 1928 (Domingo), 1930 (Teresa), 1932 (Alfonso Carlos), 1937 (Javier), 1938 (Pilar)&lt;/ref&gt; Some were active as [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] militants during the [[Francoism|Francoist]] period and afterwards, in the 1970s opposing the socialist bid of [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]]; José Maria, Alfonso and Domingo Fal-Conde Macias&lt;ref&gt;in the 1960s he was leading provincial Sevilla Carlists until deposed by the Hugocarlistas, Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''El Naufragio de las ortodoxias.

==Early public career==
[[File:Esparanza de triana año 1915.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Semana Santa]], Seville, around 1915]]
It is not clear whether there were any Carlist antecedents among the ancestors of Fal; some authors claim there were none,&lt;ref&gt;Josep Carles Clemente, ''Ultima entrevista con Fal Conde'', [in:] ''elcaballerodeltristedestino'' blog 01.04.12, available [http://elcaballerodeltristedestino.blogspot.com/2012/04/la-ultima-entrevista-de-manuel-fal.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; while others quote his family as exemplary case of Carlism having been transmitted from generation to generation as sort of a genetic code.&lt;ref&gt;allegedly the ancestral family record of Fal contained "precedentes familiares donde el ideario tradicionalista, furtemente arraigado, se transmitía de generación n generación como si de una especie de herencie genética se tratase", Alvarez Rey 1993, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; It is known that Fal's father was a devout Catholic, but none of the sources consulted provides clear information what exactly his political outlook was. It is possible that Traditionalist views were if not reinforced then implanted in the young Fal during his education. At the turn of the centuries the Jesuits were clearly sympathizing with [[Ramón Nocedal Romea|Ramón Nocedal]] and his [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] vision of religion and Traditionalism; it is likely that his Villafranca years affected Fal accordingly. He admitted juvenile fascination with address delivered to the college audience by [[Manuel Senante Martinez|Manuel Senante]], at that time one of key Integrist politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Militant Catholicism of Manuel Sanchez de Castro is likely to have contributed further on, forming the young Fal as an energetic Catholic activist, possibly along the intransigent and ultra-reactionary Integrist lines.&lt;ref&gt;compare his vision of Spain’s raison d’etre: "Patria española es una realidad historica, cuya unidad indestructibile fur forjada, no tanto por la comunidad de territorio, raza, o de lengua, sino ante todo y esencialmente por la unidad de Fe católica y el destino común de los diversos pueblos que concurren a formarla", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Fal commenced his public assignments already during the academic years in Seville; he joined Asociación Escolar Sevillana and soon grew to be its president; the organization remained a fairly typical student grouping, though politically it tended towards "catolicismo político y social", flavored by Traditionalism in general and by pro-German [[World War I]] stand in particular.&lt;ref&gt;José Calvo Gonzalez, ''Restauración tomista y catolicismo militante en la Universidad de Sevilla (1884-1924)'', [in:] ''Anuario de filosofia del derecho'' 6 (1989), p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return from Madrid he started contributing to local Catholic periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s he excelled, however, in various Catholic organizations, ranging from educational associations to charity groupings to trade unions to penitentiary circles, like Congregación de los Luises, Conferencias de San Vicente de Paulo, various Hermandades de Penitencia, the Jesuit-sponsored Patronato para Obreros, the Franciscan-sponsored Compaña de las Hermanas de la Cruz and a number of others.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 21, 23&lt;/ref&gt; He also launched some initiatives himself, like the 1924-inaugurated Romería de la Peña de la Reina de los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 22-23&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure to a variety of structures provided Fal with experience and confirmed his enormous capacity as organizer.

It is not clear whether during late [[Restoration (Spain)|Restoration]] or during the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship Fal was active in the Integrist ranks. When discussing his post-1931 activity, present-day scholars almost unanimously refer to him as to a former Integrist&lt;ref&gt;compare "el integrista Manuel Fal Conde" (Clemente 1999, p. 30), "Manuel Fal Conde (antiguo integrista)" (Julián Sanz Hoya, ''De la resistencia a la reacción: las derechas frente a la Segunda República (Cantabria, 1931-1936)'', Santander 2006, {{ISBN|9788481024203}}, p. 213), "Manuel Fal Conde, que procedía del integrismo" (Gonzalo Redondo, ''Historia de la Iglesia en España, 1931-1939: La Segunda República, 1931-1936'', Madrid 1993, {{ISBN|9788432129841}}, p. 305), "integrista Manuel Fal Conde" (Eduardo Gonzalez-Calleja, ''El ex-rey'', [in:] Javier Moreno Luzón (ed.), ''Alfonso XIII'', Madrid 2003, {{ISBN|9788495379597}}, p. 418), "Manuel Fal-Conde, joven abogado andaluz, procedente del campo integrista" (Román Oyarzun Oyarzun, ''Historia del carlismo'', Madrid 2008, {{ISBN|9788497614481}}, p. 464), "integrista Manuel Fal Conde" (Javier Tusell, Feliciano Montero García, José María Marín Arce, ''Las derechas en la España contemporánea'', Madrid 1997, {{ISBN|9788476585245}}, p. 219), "integristas como Manuel Fal Conde" (Antonio M. Moral Roncal, ''La cuestión religiosa en la Segunda República Española: Iglesia y carlismo'', Madrid 2009, {{ISBN|9788497429054}}, p. 64), "Manuel Fal Conde, abogado integrista de Sevilla" (Juan Iturralde, ''La guerra de Franco, los vascos y la iglesia: Quiénes y con qué fin prepararon la guerra y cómo comenzó'', New York 1978, p. 98)&lt;/ref&gt; or even more explicitly as to "antiguo militante del Partido Integrista",&lt;ref&gt;Fernando García Cortázar, ''El tradicionalismo de Fal Conde'', [in:] ''ABC'' 19.05.15, available [http://www.abc.es/cultura/20150519/abci-tradicionalismo-cortazar-historia-ideas-201505161737.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; though none provides detailed information on his engagement in any party initiatives of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;some sources claim that he joined the Integrists as late as 1930, Robert Vallverdú i Martí, ''El Carlisme Català Durant La Segona República Espanyola 1931-1936'', Barcelona 2008, {{ISBN|9788478260805}}, p. 161f, Jordi Canal, ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|8420639478}}, p. 312&lt;/ref&gt; When reporting on Fal's activities in 1930, the Integrist daily ''[[El Siglo Futuro]]'' referred to him as "queridisimo amigo nuestro de Sevilla",&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.10.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000477241&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; which suggests that he might have indeed co-operated with Integrism in general and the newspaper in particular also earlier on, especially that he displayed a particular knack for journalism: he is known to have contributed to various press titles before 1923,&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; launched his own daily later and was correspondent of ''El Siglo Futuro'' in the early 1930s.

==Political beginnings==
[[File:Fitxer Proclamació de la República Plaça Sant Jaume. Fotògraf Josep Maria Sagarra, 1931.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] declared, 1931]]
Fal, who later confessed to approaching politics as Christian responsibility and a call from God,&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Martínez Sánchez, ''El jacobinismo antirrepublicano del Manuel Fal Conde y del cardenal Segura'', [in:] Manuel Álvarez Tardío (ed.), ''Nuevos estudios sobre la Cultura Política en la II República Española 1931-1936'', Madrid 2012, {{ISBN|9788415454830}}, p. 106; furtherly developed in Ricardo Martínez de Salazar y Bascuñana, ''Manuel J. Fal Conde. La política como servicio de Dios y España'', Cádiz, 1998. By the end of his life he straightforwardly referred to Comunión Tradicionalista as "obra de Dios" and perceived its mission as political evangelization, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 150-1. Though devout faithful, he nevertheless resisted advances of Catholic visionaries like José Lles Segarra, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; was first recorded as engaged in a political enterprise in the spring of 1930. He was among members of Junta Organizadora of Partido Tradicionalista-Integrista, a new post-dictatorial incarnation of Integrism,&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 11.04.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000469914&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged as leader of the Seville branch of the party.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 20.10.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000477526&amp;page=1 here]; some sources claim that the group was in fact a joint Integrist and [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimist]] initiative, preconfiguration of later unification of all Traditionalist branches; according to this account both the Integrist leader Juan Olazabal and the Jaimist one marqués de Villores nominated Fal Jefe Regional of Western Andalusia of their respective organizations, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1930 he was also busy co-organizing local branches of Juventud Integrista.&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 13.10.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000477241&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Fal witnessed emergence of militantly secular [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]] with horror;&lt;ref&gt;compare Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''1868 en la memoria carlista de 1931: dos revoluciones anticlericales y un paralelo'', [in:] ''Hispania Sacra'' 59/119 (2007), pp. 337-361&lt;/ref&gt; he personally led local Juventud organization trying to protect the Seville churches against [[:es:Quema de conventos de 1931 en España|violence which erupted in May 1931]].&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1931 he ran for [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] from [[Cadiz]];&lt;ref&gt;some claim that he competed as member of the Right-wing coalition, see Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 25; other sources claim that he presented his bid as Independent Right candidate, Martin Blinkhorn, Carlism and Crisis in Spain 1931-1939, Cambridge 2008, {{ISBN|9780521207294}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; the bid proved unsuccessful. According to a homage publication Fal gained enough votes to be voted in, but it was behind-the-stage manipulations which relegated him to non-electable position; embittered, he has never run for the Cortes again.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 25. According to the authors, impartial scrutiny would have given Fal 15,000 votes. According to official results, the last elected candidate in the Cadíz district gathered 34,000 votes, compare the official Cortes service, available [http://www.congreso.es/portal/page/portal/Congreso/Congreso/SDocum/ArchCon/SDHistoDipu/SDBuscHisDip?_piref73_1340033_73_1340032_1340032.next_page=/wc/enviarCgiBuscadorHistorico here]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he focused on a newly acquired daily, ''El Observador'', re-launched as an ultraconservative Catholic title in Seville,&lt;ref&gt;more details in Alfonso Braojos Garrido, ''Tradicionalismo y antimasonería en la Sevilla de la II República. El semanario "El Observador" (1931-1933)'', [in:] José Antonio Ferrer Benimeli (ed.), ''Masonería, política y sociedad'', vol. 1, Madrid 1989, {{ISBN|8440449402}}, pp. 381-404&lt;/ref&gt; apart from contributing to other local periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;like the Integrist ''La Union'', Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1932 the Integrists re-united with Carlism in [[:es:Comunión Tradicionalista|Comunión Tradicionalista]]. Fal was entrusted the West-Andalusian jefatura&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; and together with provincial leaders&lt;ref&gt;José María Alvear (Cordoba), Ramón Contreras (Granada), Fernando Contreras (Jáen) and Ricardo Huelin (Málaga), Moral Roncal 2009, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; achieved remarkable success implanting Traditionalism where it was hardly popular.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 74; some scholars write about "auténtica eclosión tradicionalista" in Western Andalusia, all thanks to proselytism and efficiency of Fal, Canal 2000, p. 313; detailed analysis of his strategy in Moral Roncal 2012 and Leandro Alvarez Rey, ''El carlismo en Andalusia durante la II República (1931-1936)'', [in:] Alfonso Braojos Garrido, Leandro Alvarez Rey, Francisco Espinoza Maestre (eds.), ''Sevilla 36: sublevación fascista y represión'', Brenes 1990, {{ISBN|9788486335663}}, pp. 17-79&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristic feature of his leadership was – even in comparison to other Carlist leaders - unveiled hostility towards the Republic. Fal remained enthusiastic about co-operation with [[Sanjurjo]];&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 28-9&lt;/ref&gt; Andalusia was where the coup was most welcomed by local Carlists.&lt;ref&gt;some of them killed in the fighting which ensued, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath Fal was arrested for 3 months,&lt;ref&gt;longer incarceration was experienced only by 2 leaders of Andalusian requeté, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 92, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; which did not discourage him from sounding other military on leading a potential Carlist rising.&lt;ref&gt;like Varela, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 97; the two met in prison, Canal 2000, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Also his ''El Observador'' kept making references to violence.&lt;ref&gt;Fal noted that the Catholic citizenry must defend society "even with its blood" against unjust and usurping power,  Blinkhorn 2008, p. 104; in July 1933 he stated bluntly that "power is violence" and called to organize resistance adequate to the violence experienced, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Two other specific features of Andalusian Carlism were impact on Catholic youth&lt;ref&gt;Fal proved to be very skilful when organising Semana Santa in Seville in 1932; as a lawyer he did his utmost to defy the constitutional ban on all public displays or religiosity, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 64; he turned out to be staunch defender of Segura and enemy of Herrera Oria and Tedeschini, accused of appeasement and cowardice, Moral Roncal 2009, p. especially the chapter ''"Contra el imperio de los personalismos": críticas carlistas contra Tedeschini, Herrera Oria y Vidal'', pp. 165-176. Compare also "lealtad, valentía: Senante, Fal Conde, ''El Siglo Futuro''. Los protagonistas de las "cobardias y defecciones" quedarían (con frecuencia, aunque no siempre) implícatos en su [Segura’s] pluma. No es necesario cavilar en exceso para intuir, que se referia al triunvirato Herrera-Tedeschini-Vidal y Barraquer", Santiago Martínez Sánchez, ''El Cardenal Pedro Segura y Sáenz (1880-1957)'', [PhD thesis at Universidad de Navarra], Pamplona 2002, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; and initiatives targeting the urban working-class. In many Andalusian districts Carlism emerged as an exclusively youth movement, which in the spring of 1933 pushed Fal to create a federation of local Juventud circles.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 116, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Acute social problems in turn induced Fal to set up fairly successful Workers Section in early 1933.&lt;ref&gt;named Agrupación Gremial Tradicionalista, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 30, also Blinkhorn 2008, p. 117, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Quintillo 1934.jpg|thumb|Quintillo,1934]]
Fal gained nationwide attention following the [[Zumarraga, Spain|Zumarraga]] act;&lt;ref&gt;in June 1933 the Carlists organized nationwide celebrations to the memory of Zumalacarregui, staged in a Gipuzkoan town of Zumarraga. Attendants, mostly from the North of Spain, were amazed by arrival of a cavalcade of buses carrying a massive Andalusian contingent, headed by Fal, Eduardo Gonzales Calleja, ''Contrarrevolucionarios'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788420664552}}, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; in recognition of his excellent organization skills in November 1933 [[Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime|Alfonso Carlos]] nominated Fal Jefe Regional for all Andalusia,&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 32; for Fal as Carlist regional leader see Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''Manuel Fal Conde y el carlismo andaluz'', [in:] José Leonardo Ruiz Sánchez (ed.), ''La confrontación católico-laicista en Andalucía durante la crisis de entreguerras'', Sevilla 2012, {{ISBN|978-8447214198}}, pp. 169-188&lt;/ref&gt; but the most impressive coup was yet to come: in April 1934 regional Carlism organized a massive gathering at Quintillo estate near Seville. This demonstration of local prowess climaxed in parade of 650 uniformed and well-trained [[Requetés]], which made a stunning impact on guests from other regions.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 32-3&lt;/ref&gt; When national leadership of [[Tomás Domínguez Arévalo|Conde Rodezno]] was called into question due to rapprochement with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsists]] and his gradualist strategy,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 137, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Fal became one of top contenders for the job.&lt;ref&gt;his candidature launched by Lamamie, Contreras and Senante&lt;/ref&gt; Alfonso Carlos, himself sympathetic to Integrism and personally familiar with Fal since late Restoration, seemed well-disposed. In May 1934, despite his relatively young age&lt;ref&gt;people assuming Carlist political leadership were usually far more advanced in age: Nocedal was 58 (in 1879), Cerralbo 45 (1890), Barrio 55 (1899), Feliu 66 (1909), [[Cesáreo Sanz Escartín|Sanz Escartin]] 74 (1918), Comín 61 (1919) and Rodezno 50 (1932), though there were exceptions: Larramendi and Villores were only 38 (respectively in 1919 and in 1921)&lt;/ref&gt; and unenthusiastic welcome from Carlist stronghold, [[Navarre]], Fal was nominated Secretary General of the Communión.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 138. Canal 2000, pp. 312-3, gives two reasons for Fal’s elevation: his relatively young age and successes in Andalusia&lt;/ref&gt; ''El Siglo Futuro'' hailed him as "Sevillian [[Zumalacarregui]]"&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 138, Canal 2000, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; and Carlist youth welcomed him as the man who "brought [[Montejurra]] to Andalusia".&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 140; favourably disposed contemporaries claimed that he turned the city from "Sevilla la Roja" to "Sevilla de las Boinas Rojas", Moral Roncal 2009, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Jefe''==
[[File:Míting del del Cercle Tradicionalista.jpeg|thumb|left|Carlist meeting, 1930s]]
Fal embarked on massive reorganization of Carlist structures.&lt;ref&gt;the most thorough organisational change since remodeling commanded by marqués de Cerralbo in the 1890s&lt;/ref&gt; He created 5 central Delegaciones;&lt;ref&gt;co-ordinating Youth, Press, Propaganda, Requeté and Finance activities, headed respectively by Arellano, Gonzalez Quevedo, Lamamié, Zamanillo and Sangarrén, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 207, Vallverdú 2008, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Council of Culture&lt;ref&gt;headed by Pradera, it was set up to diffuse ideology and unite Carlists of different origins, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 207-8&lt;/ref&gt; and Grand Council.&lt;ref&gt;it was created to bring regional jefaturas closer to command centre, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Launch of official Carlist gazette enhanced communication.&lt;ref&gt;named ''Boletín de Orientación Tradicionalista''; it removed perennial problem of dependence on good will of editorial staff running Carlist dailies; the key ones at that time were ''El Siglo Futuro'' (Madrid), ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' (Pamplona), ''El Correo Catalan'' (Barcelona) and ''La Union'' (Sevilla). For detailed discussion see José Fermín Garralda Arizcun, ''"El Boletín Carlista de Orientación Tradicionalista" y la strategia política del tradicionalismo de 1934 a 1936,'' [in:] Alfonso Bullón de Mendoza, Luis Togores (eds.), ''Revisión de la Guerra Civil Española'', Madrid 2002, {{ISBN|8497390008}}, pp. 436-444&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly, he detached affiliated organizations from local circulos and joined them in nationwide, parallel, centrally commanded structures. The first remodeled were Requeté&lt;ref&gt;detailed discussion in Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil española, 1936-1939'', Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709758}}, esp. chapter ''Manuel Fal Conde y la milicia para la insurrección'', pp. 79-84; see also Gonzales Calleja 2011, pp. 198-200, 259-265, Eduardo G. Calleja, Julio Aróstegui, ''La tradición recuperada: el Requeté Carlista y la insurrección'', [in:] ''Historia Contemporanea'' 11 (1994), pp. 30-31. Fal contributed to Requeté buildup in his trademark way, compiling ''Requete Prayerbook''; Pablo Larraz Andía, Víctor Sierra-Sesumaga (eds.), ''Requetés. De las trincheras al olvidio'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499700465}}, p. 126; on the cover it bore a phrase "Ante Dios nunca serás héroe anónimo" (before God you are never an anonymous hero), intended to counter the atheist symbol of an unknown soldier, Jeremy MacClancy, ''The Decline of Carlism'', Reno 2000, {{ISBN|9780874173444}}, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and Juventud Tradicionalista,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 208-9&lt;/ref&gt; with [[:es:Agrupación Escolar Tradicionalista|AET]] and Margaritas (Carlist feminine organization) somewhat less successful.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; New affiliated formations were created: urban proletariat was lured to Agrupación Gremial, a Carlist red cross organization emerged as Socorro Blanco and a grouping for younger boys was established as Pelayos.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Internal taxation was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 214; he created Tesoro de la Tradicion, sort of the Carlist ministry of finance, Vallverdu 2008, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Carlist periodicals were co-ordinated within modern propaganda machinery,&lt;ref&gt;one scholar has coined the term "modernización reaccionaria", "reactionary modernity", to describe the Fal’s skills in expoiting modern means to pursue his reactionary policy, see Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, ''Paradójicos reaccionarios: la modernidad contra la República de la Comunión Tradicionalista'', [in:] ''El Argonauta Espanol'' 9 (2012), available [http://argonauta.revues.org/1409 here]&lt;/ref&gt; brought under more discipline in return for financial help.&lt;ref&gt;which i.e. transformed ''El Siglo Futuro'' from a 19th-century daily into a fully modern newspaper with photographs, graphics, complex layout and new sections, Vallverdú 2008, p. 275; in 1935 Carlism controlled 9 dailies, 19 other periodicals, Josep Carles Clemente, ''Los días fugaces. El carlismo, de las guerras civiles a la transición'', Cuenca 2013, {{ISBN|978-8495414243}}, p. 37. Detailed discussion in Cristina Barrero Gordillo, ''El carlismo y su red de prensa en la Segunda Republica'', Bilbao 2004, {{ISBN|9788497390378}} and Eduardo González Calleja, ''La prensa carlista y falangista durante la Segunda República y la Guerra Civil (1931-1937)'', [in:] ''El Argonauta Espanol'' 9 (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

The change meant vast improvement in terms of steerability,&lt;ref&gt;Requeté transformed from local groupings, capable at best of protecting local churches, into a nationwide paramilitary structure capable of achieving tactical military objectives. No other party possessed a comparable "shirt organization", with Falangist, Anarchist, Socialist or Communist militias formatted chiefly as urban hit-squads specialising in limited street violence like sabotage, arson or assassination&lt;/ref&gt; provided critical mass and enhanced homogeneity,&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; though also enforced discipline and laid command of all structures in hands of Fal and his entourage, removing dependence on local juntas and especially on the [[Southern Basque Country|Vasco-Navarros]].&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; The latter complained about "fascistization" of the Comunión,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 220-222&lt;/ref&gt; especially that Fal's trusted collaborators were appointed to key positions.&lt;ref&gt;others were offered prestigious but not really influential roles; that was the case of conde Rodezno, former political leader. He was not given jefatura of any of the newly created sections, but was offered a seat in the Council of Culture instead, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, remodeled Comunión was fully able to bear the weight of rapidly expanding ranks; instead of inefficient isolated circulos where zeal of new converts was evaporating, new structures channeled and reinforced enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;for numerical overview of Carlist structures in 1936 see Vallverdú 2008, pp. 248–260&lt;/ref&gt; Organization question aside, the change started even to affect the way of life.&lt;ref&gt;apart from reading Carlist newspapers and frequenting Carlist libraries, Carlists were asked to buy Carlist products, spend vacations in Carlist hotels and even play football in Carlist football league, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 211; Fal co-founded Asociación Deportiva Tradicionalista, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Comunión began to expand into unlikely areas both geographically and socially; structures were emerging in such regions as Extremadura or the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], while following the example of Western Andalusia, representatives of urban proletariat started to appear in local bodies also elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;structures of the Comunión were incomparably more heterogeneous socially than those of Renovación, filled often with local aristocrats; some scholars call them, applying their own social cliches and preferences, "more democratic", see Blinkhorn 2008, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Northerners who conceived Traditionalism as rooted in family and regional values,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 153-4&lt;/ref&gt; Fal was focused on structures. As alliances were likely to get them dominated by other groupings, victorious campaign – maybe unfeasible as exclusively Carlist affair - should be launched and controlled by Carlists.&lt;ref&gt;a British scholar writing in the 1970s, perfectly familiar with history of Carlist marginalization within Francoist structures, nevertheless hails Rodezno’s strategy as "pragmatic" and lambasts Fal’s vision as "sheer wishful thinking", Blinkhorn 2008, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; In line with this vision, under Fal Carlism steered clear of alliances,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 135-6&lt;/ref&gt; its strategy dubbed "isolationism" or "exclusiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt; Though he felt compelled to join [[Renovación Española]] in National Bloc (the Spanish Right-wing political alliance of the 1930s) late 1934, he made sure the access was as non-committal as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, pp. 188-194, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 127-134&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935 he grew increasingly skeptical&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2008, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; and later that year let Rodezno mix with the Alfonsinos on the private business basis&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; before definitely abandoning the alliance in the spring of 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, p. 318&lt;/ref&gt; From the onset highly suspicious about [[Spanish Confederation of Autonomous Right-wing Groups|CEDA]]&lt;ref&gt;already in 1933 Fal expressed a view, later growing to a dogma, that members of different parties better stick to their own organizations, Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 203-4, Witnessing the emergence of CEDA he was skeptical, not only because of its accidentalism and infection of liberalism, but also as it was born out of the ungodly Republican regime, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 102. In late 1933, when CEDA opted for a coalition with Lerroux, Fal, recently promoted to Delegate for all Andalusia, concluded that Gil Robles had cut himself off from his former allies and that was no way to defend religion in Spain, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 125. In early 1934 ''El Observador'' was waging a regular anti-CEDA campaign, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; he was more than happy to see it decompose in 1935-6.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumbnail|Carlist standard]]
Another shift in Carlist strategy under Fal was [[Electoral Carlism (Second Republic)|de-emphasizing of politics]] and focusing on organizational buildup, with special attention paid to paramilitary. His vision was already set on violent overthrow of the Republic; starting 1935 openly belligerent language became increasingly common at Carlist rallies, with references to sacrifice, blood, arms, violence and power.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Permitting taking part in 1936 elections, Fal did not pay much attention to the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Carlos addressed Fal in a letter, suggesting that he fields his candidature as well; Fal refused, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Though Rodeznistas viewed him as a uninspiring, colorless, mediocre bureaucrat,&lt;ref&gt;especially compared to charismatic figures of other Right-wing leaders like Calvo Sotelo or José Antonio, or even compared to eloquent and gregarious Rodezno; Blinkhorn 2008, p. 215. The so-called cruzadistas accused Fal and his "Integrist camarilla" of taking part in conspiracy, aiming at transferring dynastic rights to the Alfonsinos, though scholars dismiss this charges as idiosyncratic. In fact, Fal was also anxious about looming problem of succession, but preferred not to press Alfonso Carlos and wait for him to make a decision, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; Fal gained recognition bordering devotion among Requeté and the youth.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Also Alfonso Carlos seemed perfectly satisfied;&lt;ref&gt;Fal accepted Alfonso Carlos’ decision to set up a regency with no objections. Though many considered Don Javier – a hardly known foreigner – a laughable figure as a prospective claimant, and preferred fusionist talks with the Alfonsinos instead, it was not the case of Fal, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1935 he raised Fal from Secretary General to Jefe Delegado.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced that in the battle against democracy Carlists must strike first,&lt;ref&gt;especially after the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] victory in [[Spanish general election, 1936|February 1936 elections]], Blinkhorn 2008, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Fal threw himself into wartime preparations;&lt;ref&gt;spending more time in San-Jean-de-Luz with Don Javier than in Spain, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 237, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 35. Some sources claim he was exiled in France, Mercedes Peñalba Sotorrío, ''Entre la boina roja y la camisa azul'', Estella 2013, {{ISBN|9788423533657}}, p. 16, Stanley G. Payne, ''Falange: a History of Spanish Fascism'', vol. 22, Stanford 1961, {{ISBN|9780804700580}}, pp. 109-110, also Jacek Bartyzel, ''Manuel (José) Fal Conde'', [in:] ''legitymizm.org'' service, available [http://www.legitymizm.org/spw-manuel-fal-conde here]. He headed the Junta Suprema Militar, consisting of general Muslera, teniente coronel Baselga, teniente coronel Rada, capitan Sanjurjo (son of the exiled general) and local military inspectors, Juan Carlos Peñas Bernaldo de Quirós, ''El Carlismo, la República y la Guerra Civil (1936-1937). De la conspiración a la unificación'', Madrid 1996, {{ISBN|9788487863523}}, pp. 18-21&lt;/ref&gt; his initial plan was abandoned in April 1936.&lt;ref&gt;it envisioned two focos of Requeté insurgency in Western Spain as means to lure governmental troops, while Madrid conspirators disguised as Guardia Civil were to take control of key offices and Requeté arriving from the North would guarantee success as reinforcements. The plan was abandoned when security discovered false Guardia Civil uniforms. It was based on assumption that the army would remain passive; though talks were held with Sanjurjo, no accord was struck; Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 240-2, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; He envisaged a purely Carlist insurrection&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; with conditional assistance of the army.&lt;ref&gt;which might be helpful if not vital, given the military do not push conditions compromising Carlist principles, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Fal placed his bets on Sanjurjo, who agreed to lead the rising.&lt;ref&gt;either staged as exclusively Carlist enterprise or as a joint Carlist-military project; transitional government would be a stopgap solution leading to establishment of a Traditionalist monarchy, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 243. Sanjurjo and Fal met as early as in March 1936 in Lisbon, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Talks with [[Emilio Mola|Mola]] proved unsuccessful. The general&lt;ref&gt;most of the conspiring generals viewed insurgency as means to change the government, prevent revolution and ensure order, not as means to re-establish the monarchy, let alone a Traditionalist one, César Alcalá, ''D. Mauricio de Sivatte. Una biografía política (1901-1980)'', Barcelona 2001, {{ISBN|8493109797}}, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; refused to accept Fal's conditions,&lt;ref&gt;during the talks Fal remained entirely intransigent, which drove Mola to desperation. He later admitted having been close to shooting himself, "este hombre [Fal] estuvo a punto de conseguir que yo me pegara un tiro", Maximiliano Garcia Venero, ''Historia de la unificacion'', Madrid 1970, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; which aimed at toppling the Republic and installing Traditionalist monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;he demanded derogation of Republican legislature, dissolution of all parties (including the supportive ones), provisional dictatorship with temporary directorate heavily controlled by the Carlists, future corporatist state, and usage of monarchist standard; detailed review of the talks in Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 31-35, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 18-21, Aróstegui 2013, pp. 93-128, Gonzales Calleja 2011, pp. 370-388&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mola opened parallel negotiations with the Navarrese. Led by Rodezno, the latter bypassed Fal and were keen to commit local Requeté to a joint insurgency with almost no strings attached.&lt;ref&gt;most detailed account in Tomás Echeverría, ''Cómo se preparó el alzamiento: el general Mola y los carlistas'', Madrid 1985, {{ISBN|8439850123}}; see also Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 246-8, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 35-37. Key Falcondistas are listed as follows: José Luis Zamanillo, José Zuazola, José Martinez Berasáin (sic!), Juan María Roma, Pedro Roma, Mauricio Sivatte, Juan Lavaquial, José Brú, Luis Zuazola and Agustín Tellería. Key Rodeznistas listed are: conde Rodezno, Victor Pradera, Fernando Contreras, José María Oriol, Juan Olazábal, Domingo Tejera, Javier Martínez de Morentin, Luis Arellano, Marcelino Ulibarri, Gaitán de Ayalá, José María Valiente (sic!) and José María Arauz de Robles, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 18. Some authors add also the Baleztena brothers, though others indicate that their position was highly ambiguous, see Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''La continuidad ideológica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil'' [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Though at that point Fal considered dismissing the entire Navarrese junta,&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 249&lt;/ref&gt; he decided not to risk open confrontation; Rodezno and his entourage outmaneuvered him and elicited hesitant approval from the royal envoy, [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]].&lt;ref&gt;Don Javier later referred to the stance adopted by the Navarros as "una traicíon a nuestros principios y a nuestras gentes, cuya sangre habemos sacrificado inutimente", Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 39-40. There was no formal pact between the military and the Carlists; Mola and Fal agreed to act on basis of the letter, sent by Sanjurjo on July 11. Its contents allow usage of monarchist standard provided army units related use none, apolitical government with civilians, abolishing of all political parties (including these supporting the coup), dismantling Republican regime and introducing a new state. There was no explicit committal to monarchy, let alone Traditionalist one, and no guarantee of Carlist role in either military command or provisional government. Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 247-250&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|outbreak of hostilities]]&lt;ref&gt;on July 19 he was flown from Sant-Jean-de-Luz to Pamplona, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 121, where he spent a day. During the night he travelled by car to Burgos, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 215, others say he stayed in Pamplona until July 25, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Fal headed the new Carlist wartime executive, Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra,&lt;ref&gt;full squad in Ricardo Ollaquindia, ''La Oficina de Prensa y Propaganda Carlista de Pamplona al comienzo de la guerra de 1936'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 56 (1995), p. 486. See also Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 218, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 28. Fal divided his time between office work, talking to foreign correspondents (compare ''Fal Conde y el requete juzgados por el extranjero Cronicas de prensa'', a book published in Burgos in 1937, and Antonio César Moreno Cantano, ''El carlismo y la propaganda exterior durante la Guerra Civil española'' [unpublished paper delivered to Congreso La Guerra Civil Española 1936 - 1939, 2006]) and especially visiting Carlist troops on the front-lines, Larraz, Sierra-Sesumaga 2011, p. 212, Aróstegui 2013, pp. 357, 436, 713, 729&lt;/ref&gt; and had to acknowledge that instead of being equal partner, Carlism was getting reduced to a junior role.&lt;ref&gt;as late as in September Fal saw the rising as an alliance of equals between the military and the Carlists; he found room for the Falange only as a junior partner, whose assistance was somewhat condescendingly welcomed, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 265. Though he accepted a compromise with military authoritarianism and eventually admitted its leading role, Fal made no secret that Traditionalist monarchy should be reinstated immediately following victory; even Don Javier was less explicit and tending to accept some sort of longer transition period of military dictatorship, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; His position was already precarious. Death of Sanjurjo deprived him of a key ally among the generals.&lt;ref&gt;Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Death of Alfonso Carlos left the movement with no king and made dissent easier.&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso Carlos’ successor as a regent, Don Javier, confirmed Fal as Jefe Delegado, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 21. The likes of Rodezno claimed that the regent had merely to be "consulted", not necessarily obeyed, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; The Navarrese set up their own Junta Central Carlista de Guerra de Navarra, which emerged as a competitive, though theoretically only regional body, and kept bypassing Fal;&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 42-3, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 269, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 47-49; the latter distinguished between "carlismo nacional" (maximalist, orthodox and intransigent), and "carlismo regional" (possibilist and flexible), Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 214, 219-221&lt;/ref&gt; Carlist executive was decomposing.&lt;ref&gt;geographical dispersion of Carlist executive added to overall confusion; Fal resided in Toledo, some agendas of Junta Nacional in Burgos and some in Salamanca; the king was in Vienna, his envoy Don Javier in Sant-Jean-de-Luz, while the Navarrese Junta Central resided in Pamplona, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt; As Requeté units, the key Carlist argument, unconditionally left at generals’ disposal were dispersed among various fronts,&lt;ref&gt;the strongest contingent, provided by the Navarrese, was divided between 4 areas: some units were engaged on the Basque front, some in the East against the Anarchists in Aragon, and some on the central front in Sierra de Guadarrama. Isolated units were active also in Andalusia, Extremadura and Castile. In all cases, Carlist units, a battalion the largest one, were attached to army divisions commanded by career generals. Most thorough military analysis in Aróstegui 2013, political impact in Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; Carlism – in line with Fal's worst nightmares – was indeed getting dominated by its alliance partners.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; During the outbreak of the Nationalist uprising in Navarre, a mass killing was conducted by the insurgents against all civilian dissidence in the Navarre rearguard, taking a death toll of circa 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dronda |first=Javier |date=2013 |title=Con Cristo o contra Cristo: Religión y movilización antirrepublicana en Navarra (1931-1936)|url= |location=Tafalla |publisher=Txalaparta |pages=381 |isbn=978-84-15313-31-1 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Paul Preston | title=The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain. | publisher= HarperCollins | location= London, UK | isbn=978-0-00-638695-7 | year=2013 | page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fal's attitude towards the Republicans is subject to conflicting accounts. Some maintain that he was the instigator of bloody repressions, also directed against the clergy with Basque nationalist sympathies,&lt;ref&gt;in mid-September 1936 Fal addressed general Cabanillas, head of the Burgos Junta, protesting the "mild" nature of military [[Campaign of Gipuzkoa|repression in Gipuzkoa]], especially this related to clergy with Basque nationalist inclinations; he alleged that the army commanders feared of "tropezar con la Iglesia", Paul Preston, ''The Spanish Holocaust: Inquisition and Extermination in Twentieth-Century Spain'', London 2013, {{ISBN|9780006386957}}, p. 141. In his letter to cardinal Segura of early September Fal lamented limited repressive means administred in Gipuzkoa, "mientras los del sur se exceden. En Badajoz capital dicen que llegan a 5.000 los fusilados, mientras que en Tolosa solo van 17", quoted after Santiado Martínez Sanchez, ''Los papeles perdidos del cardenal Segura'', 1880-1957, Pamplona 2004, p. 381. In letters to Segura and the Carlist war commissioner Luis Barrio, Fal recommended exemplary punishment of priests supporting the nationalists and suggested they are court-martialed, writing that "todos aquellos  [of the priests] que estén incursos en el bando militar deben ser fusilados pero por consejo de guerra", quoted after Padro Barruso Barés, ''La represión en las zonas republicana y franquista del País Vasco durante la Guerra Civil'', [in:] ''Historia Contemporánea'' 35 (2007), p. 672. Some scholars stress that the only difference between Fal and the Falangists was that the Carlist leader wanted to see the pro-Basque priests killed after trial, while the latter did not consider the fiction of legal proceedings necessary, Mikel Aizpuru (ed.), ''El otoño de 1936 en Guipúzcoa. Los fusilamientos de Hernani'', Irun 2007, {{ISBN|9788496643680}}, pp. 226-227. Detailed discussion in Pedro Barruso Barés, ''La represión del clero diocesano guipuzcoano durante la Guerra Civil'', [in:] ''Congreso La Guerra Civil Española 1936 - 1939'', Madrid 2006, for Fal see pp. 3-5&lt;/ref&gt; while others claim exactly the opposite, namely that he did his best to prevent executions.&lt;ref&gt;they note that Fal demanded all court-martialing cases be consulted with ecclesiastical authorities and prohibited impromptu executions, suggesting also that Requetés steer clear of the process, leaving it to the military.. They also claim that according to some accounts Fal did his best to prevent executions ("y nosotros fuimos los que después de otros, como Fal Conde, hicimos cuanto estuvo en nuestra mano para impedirlo [executions of priests]"), that he must have approved of an order issued by regional Carlist Navarrese jefe, banning improvised executions and published in ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' on July 24, that he tried to make sure Requeté were not engaged in repression and that he saved some nationalist-minded priests personally, compare Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 100-101, 118, 121, 138, 165, 220-221. According to some sources, one of the conditions put forward by Fal when negotiating Carlists joining  the coup with Mola was that Requeté would not be used for policing, Luis Redondo, Juan de Zavala, ''El requeté'', Barcelona 1957, pp. 355, 359; this claim is supposedly backed by documents quoted in [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Historia del Tradicionalismo Español'', vol. XXX, Sevilla 1979, docs nr 58 and 60, also Fernando Miguel Noriega, ''Fal Conde y el Requeté juzgados por el extranjero'', Sevilla 1976, p. 32. The conclusion advanced by this group of scholars is that "todos estos hechos ponen, al menos, en duda una afirmación tan tajante como que Manuel Fal Conde fue el principal "impulsor" de las ejecuciones de los sacerdotes nacionalistas en Guipúzcoa", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion related to the Carlist - and, due to his political leadership, also Fal's personal responsibility for nationalist atrocities committed in the rearguard is not conclusive.&lt;ref&gt;there are many works focusing on Carlism during the Civil War, but there is no scholarly monograph dedicated to Requeté and repression in the rear. Historians sympathetic to the Carlist cause tend to ignore or downplay the issue, which is almost absent in two large volumes of Pablo Larraz Andía, Víctor Sierra-Sesúmaga Ariznabarreta, ''Requetés: de las trincheras al olvido'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499700465}}, and Julio Aróstegui, ''Combatientes Requetés en la Guerra Civil española'', 1936-1939, Madrid 2013, {{ISBN|9788499709970}}. Authors sympathetic to the Republican cause, especially when dealing with repression in Navarre and the Basque Country, reserve a prominent role for the Carlists, see [http://www.librolibro.es/images/portadas/No_os_olvidaremos_Navarra_1936-Urtasun_Jose_Ramon-9788476817841.jpg José Ramón Urtasun, Carlos Martínez, Iñaki Arzoz, ''No os olvidaremos''], Pamplona 2013, {{ISBN|9788476817841}}, José Mari Ruiz Vilas, Juan Carlos Berrio Zaratiegui, José Mari Esparza Zabalegi, ''Navarra 1936: de la esperanza al terror'', Estella 2004, {{ISBN|9788493095796}}, Iñaki Egaña, ''Los crimenes de Franco en Euskal Herria'', Tafalla 2009, {{ISBN|9788481365597}}. Many works (especially the foreign ones) refer jointly to "Nationalist" or "fascist" repressions. Among these, the prevailing understanding is that Nationalist atrocities were unprovoked, systematic, pre-planned, committed by official structures and formed the very core of the regime, while Republican atrocities were spontaneous, circumstantial, committed by "uncontrollables" and offshoot criminals, provoked by the Nationalists and formed a pathological margin of the regime; excellent sample in [[Antony Beevor]], ''The Battle for Spain'', London 2006, {{ISBN|9780143037651}}. Recent work aspiring to historiographic summary of literature on civil war violence intends rather to "grapple with Francoist past" and its authors "do not aspire to treat each side equally", see Peter Anderson, Miguel Ángel del Arco Blanco, ''Mass Killings and Violence in Spain, 1936-1952: Grappling with the Past'', New York 2014, {{ISBN|9781135114855}}, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

To enhance Carlist position versus the military Fal launched two new projects in November. The first one was Obra Nacional Corporativa, general labor organization,&lt;ref&gt;which opened its structures in all Nationalist-held provinces. Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 274-5&lt;/ref&gt; another one was Military Academy,&lt;ref&gt;initially to be named Real Academia de Estudios Militares de la Comunión Tradicionalista, it was established as Real Academia Militar de Requetés; it was most likely to be headed by an Andalusian and Fal’s close friend, the Seville requeté commander Enrique Barrau. Location is unclear; some point to Navarre (Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 232-7) and some to Toledo (Aróstegui 2013, p. 139)&lt;/ref&gt; intended to train Carlist command cadres.&lt;ref&gt;Canal 2000, pp. 336-7&lt;/ref&gt; Uncomfortable with Fal's independent stance,&lt;ref&gt;historians do not agree whether the project was pre-agreed with the military; some authors claim it was either approved or consulted by Mola, some point to Franco-Salgado and others even to Franco himself, for overview see Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] summoned him to [[Burgos]] in early December and presented with the choice between exile and firing squad.&lt;ref&gt;Franco did not speak to Fal personally; the Carlist leader was received by Davila, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 239-241; detailed account in Maximiliano Garcia Venero, ''Historia de la Unificacion'', Madrid 1970, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Rodezno-dominated Junta Nacional advocated compliance&lt;ref&gt;Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 241-2, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 30-35, most detailed discussion in Jaime del Burgo Torres, ''Un episodio poco conocido de la guerra civil española. La Real Academia Militar de Requetés y el destierro de Fal Conde'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 196 (1992), pp. 481-506&lt;/ref&gt; and Fal left Spain for [[Lisbon]],&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 276-7, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 34; according to his son, Fal complied fearing grave crisis in Nationalist ranks, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; remaining official though increasingly theoretical Carlist leader.&lt;ref&gt;though he resigned as leader of Junta Nacional, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 242; real power slipped mostly towards the Navarrese. The Carlist propaganda kept venerating Fal and ignored Franco as much as possible; in Carlist press the official slogan "Una Patria, Un Estado, Un Caudillo" was often juxtaposed with a photograph of Fal; references to Franco were few and tucked away on inside pages, while those to Fal were emphasized in front, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 279, detailed discussion of Carlist press resisting unification pressure, including hailing of Fal, in Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 115-122, also Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Francisco Franco 1940 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|140px|Francisco Franco]]
Faced with unification pressure Fal did not dismiss such a perspective, but talking to fellow Traditionalists in [[Insua]] he insisted it should be completed on Carlist terms,&lt;ref&gt;in February; most detailed discussion in Julio V. Brioso y Mayral, ''Fal Conde y la asamblea de Insua'' [in:] ''Aportes'' 27 (1995), pp. 3-39, also Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 247, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 43, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 37-41, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 30-32; Josep Carles Clemente, ''Los días fugaces. El carlismo, de las guerras civiles a la transición'', Cuenca 2013, {{ISBN|9788495414243}}, pp. 45-51&lt;/ref&gt; reiterating this position also during February talks with [[Falange Española de las JONS|Falangists]].&lt;ref&gt;following talks with Falange envoys Dávila, Gamero and Escario in Lisbon, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 283, Garcia Venero 1970, pp. 82-3. In early February he replied in writing with his ''Essential Points for the Union''. The document pointed out that only equitable and complementary fusion is acceptable, with a triumvirate heading the party until the war is won and with traditionalist monarchy declared afterwards, Don Javier accepted as the regent. A future corporative state would comprise national labor syndicates and all vestiges of liberal party system would be abolished, Payne 1961, p. 155. As the Falangists replied with counter-proposal which amounted to Carlist absorption into their party, Fal confirmed his position; the new document envisioned a unified party as a temporary measure to be dissolved following victory. Though during subsequent conversations of late February even a regency under Franco was discussed, both sides reached no agreement, Payne 1961, pp. 155-156&lt;/ref&gt; At meetings in Burgos (March) and [[Pamplona]] (April), unattended by Fal, the balance tilted towards Rodeznistas, ready to accept Franco's terms of amalgamation.&lt;ref&gt;the Falcondistas were represented only by Zamanillo and Valiente. Blinkhorn 2008, p. 287, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 255-275, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 40-43, Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 33-38&lt;/ref&gt; They presented Don Javier with an ultimatum and ensured that he at least did not object.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 288-9, Peñas Bernaldo 1996, pp. 276&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[:es:Decreto de Unificación|Decreto de Unificación]] Fal was passed over as leader of a technically non-existent movement.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 291, Fermín Pérez-Nievas Borderas, ''Contra viento y marea'', Estella 1999, {{ISBN|8460589323}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt; Initially he did not protest&lt;ref&gt;what was heard from Fal was only "defeaning silence" according to Blinkhorn 2008, p. 290. Other authors claim that Fal protested, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 44; yet another scholar maintains that Fal and Don Javier issued two letters (to Carlists and to Requetés respectively) recommending "obedecer y callar" posture and refraining from opposition; Fal actually suggested to accept posts in [[Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista|FET]] given it is made clear they are accepted on orders of the Comunión, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 54-6&lt;/ref&gt; and even advised to comply.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 50; the advice did not extend to the Falangist Consejo Nacional; Fal repeatedly warned the Carlists offered seats in this body that they must not accept&lt;/ref&gt; Despite olive branch offered by Franco&lt;ref&gt;Franco invited Fal to Salamanca and the two held talks on August 11, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 46, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 50; according to Fal the dictator was cordial and effusive; he awaited the guest half-way through the room, extended his arms and exclaimed: "¡Bienvenido, qué alegría! ¡Ya está usted entre nosotros, bienvenido! Qué alegría!", quoted after Robert Vallverdú Martí, ''La metamorfosi del carlisme català: del "Déu, Pàtria i Rei" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975)'', Montserrt 2014, {{ISBN|9788498837261}}, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; – including a ministerial job&lt;ref&gt;according to some sources it was ministry of interior, see Ricardo Martínez de Salazar y Bascuñana, ''Manuel J. Fal Conde - La política como servicio de Dios y España'', Cádiz, 1998, quoted [http://www.oocities.org/athens/forum/7958/anio99/numero7/falconde.htm here]; according to the other it was ministry of justice, see Luis Suárez Fernández, Manuel Espadas Burgos, ''Historia general de España y América'', vol. 19, ''La época de Franco'',vol. 2/19, Madrid 1987, {{ISBN|9788432123597}}, p. 59, Clemente 2013, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; or seat in [[:es:Consejo Nacional del Movimiento|Consejo Nacional]]&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 293, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 81; according to some authors, he was offered vice-presidency of the Consejo Nacional, Josep Carles Clemente, ''Breve historia de las guerras carlistas'', Madrid 2011, {{ISBN|9788499671710}}, p. 221, Clemente 2013, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; – he politely refused to join.&lt;ref&gt;Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 81-2; the refusal profoundly irritated Franco, Vallverdú 2014, p. 65; Fal was formally removed from the Council in March 1938, Blinkhorn 2008, p. 293; Fal’s letter to Franco, dated 28.11.37, is fully reproduced in Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 87-90&lt;/ref&gt; His exile was lifted in October 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Blinkhorn 2008, p. 293; some scholars say Fal’s exile terminated November 1937, Clemente 2013, p. 32. Others claim Fal was not permitted to return until the end of the war, Stanley G. Payne, ''The Franco Regime'', Madison 1987, {{ISBN|9780299110703}}, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually abandoned quiet in favor of direct counter-action, suggesting to Don Javier that all those accepting seats in the FET executive be expelled; the regent acted on his advice.&lt;ref&gt;Peñas Bernaldo 1996, p. 297; detailed discussion in Joaquin Cubero Sanchez, ''El carlismo en la guerra de Espana. El destierro del Fal Conde y la unificacion'', [in:] ''Aportes'' 27 (1995), pp. 40-78&lt;/ref&gt; Unification turned into Falangist absorption of Carlist offshoots.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Navarra 1937-1939: el fiasco de la Unificación'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 69 (2008), pp. 429-456&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon return from exile&lt;ref&gt;Fal was not allowed to come back to Seville; he settled on the Villandrando estate in Palencia province Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 47; he returned to Seville following Nationalist war victory, Clemente 2011, p. 222, Clemente 2013, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and under security surveillance, Fal tried to avert takeover of Comunión assets by FET;&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; many years later he admitted that these efforts had been largely fruitless.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Communicating by correspondence with loyal regional leaders he ordered re-engineering of party structures,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 151, 191&lt;/ref&gt; but did  not prevent Carlism from falling into political confusion and fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;Aurora Villanueva Martínez, ''Organizacion, actividad y bases del carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo'' [in:] ''Geronimo de Uztariz'' 19 (2003), p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; To gain platform for legal action, in 1939 he co-founded Hermandad de los Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, intended as substitute for official Carlist network.&lt;ref&gt;other co-founders were Narciso Ripa Obanos, [[José Ángel Zubiaur Alegre|José Angel Zubiaur Alegre]], José Lampreave Blanco, Miguel Castiella Idoy, Cesáreo Sanz Orrio, Félix Abárzuza Murillo, Ramón Arregui, Jaime del Burgo Torres, Jesús Marín, Ignacio Baleztena, Tarsicio Ortiz, Juan Echeverría and Pascual Hermoso de Mendoza, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the war continued, he focused on maintaining Carlist identity and refrained from open opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Villanueva Martínez 2003, pp. 100-101&lt;/ref&gt; Though violent confrontations between Requetés and Falangists were recorded all over Spain,&lt;ref&gt;including exchange of fire, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 77, Aurora Villanueva Martínez, ''El carlismo navarro durante el primer franquismo, 1937-1951'', Madrid 1998, {{ISBN|9788487863714}}, p. 127, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; almost all were spontaneous and none of the authors consulted claims they were planned or engineered by Fal.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 59-71, 200-207; many Carlists, especially the Requetés, considered staging an action of protest, like withdrawal of their units from the front, concentration to gain critical mass or even assassination of Franco. Some concluded that "hemos perdido la guerra. Preparemos la próxima", given the next war was to be "contra los azules", quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 54-57. Apart from newspaper frontpages featuring glorification of a "caudillo" with the photo of Fal placed next, there were even songs coined: "Es Fal nuestro jefe / es el hombre que más vale / y a sus requetés / no se los merienda nadie", Emilio Herrera Alonso, ''Los mil dias del Tercio Navarra;: Biografia de un tercio de requetes'', Pamplona 1974, {{ISBN|978-8427611481}}, pp. 63-64. Fal’s home turf, Seville, was the province where most protests against Falangist domination in the new state party were recorded; Cadíz came third, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, p. 96-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1939 Fal addressed Franco with a memorandum, titled ''Manifestación de ideales''.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 371-2&lt;/ref&gt; Written with all due respect, the document claimed that the emerging regime was not sustainable and argued in favor of traditionalist monarchy; as transitory means it suggested a regency, either this of Don Javier or a collective one, alluding to Franco as its member.&lt;ref&gt;MacClancy 2000, p. 79, full text available in Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 90-96&lt;/ref&gt; Though sounding more like an offer, the document, together with other texts disseminated around that time,&lt;ref&gt;it has to be considered jointly with 3 other documents, ''El criterio tradicionalista sobre el Partido Político'', (rejection of partido único and state omnipresence), ''Bosquejo de la futura organización política española'' (confirmation of corporative and regionalist outlook) and ''Sucesión dinástica en la Monarquía Española'', (defense of monarchical model represented by Javier de Borbón Parma). Franco did not respond, but the documents in question were widely circulated and served as point of reference. Some add also ''Fijación de Orientaciones'' (1940) as another important leaflet, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 186. It was stated that "los poderes del Generalísimo son circunstanciales" and that "nadie pudo pensar seriamente que un hombre es eterno y que en él pueden fundarse las instituciones del Estado". "Su misión – the text went - acabada la guerra, nunca pudo ser otra que la de poner en marcha las instituciones del Estado, quedando él como pieza de la máquina, si cabía, o cesando" para permanecer vigilante en la "reserva", quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; is viewed by some scholars as a milestone marking total breakup with the regime and adoption of a decisive opposition strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 171-172&lt;/ref&gt; Caudillo did not respond. He reacted, however, to mayhem which erupted in Pamplona following Fal's appearance on the ayunatamiento balcony during re-burial of Sanjurjo on October 21, 1939:&lt;ref&gt;Fal was among the officials invited; during the gathering in front of the ayuntamiento building the crowd largely ignored Francoist dignitaries speaking from the balcony and demanded to see Fal. When appearing, he cried ¡Viva Cristo Rey! and ¡Viva el Rey!, triggering enthusiasm which bordered mayhem; riots ensued. Those trying to cry ¡Viva Franco! were assaulted, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Fal was ordered [[house arrest]] in Seville.&lt;ref&gt;with 2 uniformed policemen in front of his house and undercover agents following him when permitted to leave by the civil governor, Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 48-9, Clemente 2013, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Sant Bartomeu Ferreries.JPG|thumbnail|160px|[[Ferreries]], [[Menorca]], the [[Balearic Islands]]]]
From his confinement Fal presided over&lt;ref&gt;unable to leave Seville, he managed the party business by proxies, e.g. a meeting of Carlist executive in Madrid in 1940 was presided on his behalf by a veteran, [[Rafaél Díaz Aguado Salaberry]], Manuel de Santa Cruz, ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo español'', vol. 2, Madrid 1940, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; most vehement Carlist opposition,&lt;ref&gt;even his photo, when found by security during search of the suspects, was approached as incriminating evidence, Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 207-9&lt;/ref&gt; comparable only to hostility of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; No collaboration with the regime was acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 186; in 1943 Fal tried to lure back those Carlists who had joined FET earlier and declared they might return to ranks of the Comunión, excluding however key rebels like Rodezno or Bilbao, Peñalba Sotorrío 2013, pp. 90, 143&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy was to ignore all officialdom and go public styling Traditionalist initiatives as religious or combatant activities,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; though conspiracy hand in hand with the [[Partido Comunista de Espana|communists]] has been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;it was via Manuel Jiménez Fernández, former CEDA minister of agriculture and Sevillan abogado that PCE intended to lure Carlism into their Unión Nacional, an all-in anti-Francoist alliance mounted by the communists, Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 285-6&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding with regional leaders,&lt;ref&gt;like Antonio Arrue in Gipuzkoa or Joaquín Baleztena in Navarre, though co-operation with the latter has always been marked by mutual lack of confidence, Villanueva Martínez 2003, pp. 104-105&lt;/ref&gt; in 1940-41 Fal went on reconstructing Comunión structures either in traditional shape&lt;ref&gt;in 1941 he asked Fausto Gaiztarro to create delegaciones provinciales and collect money, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; or in a new format;&lt;ref&gt;in 1940 he asked Arrue to create an inter-provincial Vasco-Navarrese Carlist executive and celebrate Fiesta de los Mártires independently of official gatherings wherever possible. His idea was to re-built Carlist structures from the bottom to the top, which was contrary to Baleztena’s idea of appointments, stemming from anxiety that police would raid larger gatherings, which indeed became common in Navarre, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; official party executive existed only in a makeshift mode.&lt;ref&gt;for 1942 scholars mention "Junta Auxiliar" (composed of Manuel Senante Martínez, Calixto González Quevedo, José Luis Zamanillo, José María Aráuz de Robles, José María Lamamié de Clairac, Rafael de Olazábal, José María Valiente, Fausto Gaiztarro and [[Juan Sáenz-Díez García|Juan Sáenz Díez]]), see Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 240, and for 1944 "Junta Suprema", Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 298-9&lt;/ref&gt; He launched veiled Carlist educational network of Academia Vazquez de Mella.&lt;ref&gt;from Fal's later correspondence with Gambra it seems that he entrusted organizing specialized studies to Elias de Tejada, though they formally emerged as religious initiative of Maximo Palomar del Val, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Nic bez Boga, nic wbrew tradycji. Kosmopolityczna wizja tradycjonalizmu karlistowskiego w Hiszpanii'', Warszawa 2015, {{ISBN|9788360748732}}, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Fal banned Carlists from enlisting to [[División Azul]]&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 47, Canal 2000, p. 349&lt;/ref&gt; and advocated strictly neutral stand in [[World War Two|European conflict]], considering the British and German wars equally unjust;&lt;ref&gt;"bien sentado que la Comunión Tradicionalista no tiene juicio alguno a favor de ninguno de los contendientes en la guerra europea; que la C. T. no es germanófila ni anglófila porque es exclusivamente española (...) Podrá cada carlista opinar lo que quiera e inclinar su juicio a favor de Alemania o de Inglaterra. Los dirigentes, en cambio, han de estar especialmente atentos a la obligación de no comprometer a la Comunión en tal materia". Scholars of Catholic background when discussing Fal’s hostility towards Nazism point mostly to religious motivations, see Moral Roncal 2009, p. 217, Jacek Bartyzel, ''Tradycjonalizm (hiszpański) wobec faszyzmu, hitleryzmu i totalitaryzmu'', [in:] P''ro Fide Rege et Lege'' 71 (2013), pp. 13-32. A progressist historian puts other features on the foreground, quoting Fal say that in Nazi Germany "en lo moral, el dominio de la materia, de las corrientes impetuosas racistas y de la educación más pagana; en lo político, la tiranía del Estado; en lo social, el mecanismo de los individuos y profesiones en jerarquías sindicales tiránicas; en lo económico, la subyugación mayor imaginable de los derechos individuales y la negación de la libertad (incluso la lícita y necesaria), en beneficio de los intereses estatales", Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 264; similar approach by a student from Anglo-Saxon Protestant realm, see Blinkhorn 2008, pp. 163-185. Despite Fal’s stance, upon the outbreak of Nazi-Soviet war the German consulate in Bilbao was flooded with letters of support from Carlist leaders and there were many cases of Carlists enlisting to Division Azul, Xosé-Manoel Nuñez-Seixas, ''An Approach to the Social Profile and the Ideological Motivations of the Spanish Volunteers of the "Blue Division", 1941-1944'', [in:] Sonja Levsen, Christine Krüger (eds.), ''War Volunteering in Modern Times'', London 2010, {{ISBN|9780230228054}}, pp. 248-74&lt;/ref&gt; this did not spare him charges of entanglement in a British plot,&lt;ref&gt;"Operación Azor" was a plot advanced by British consular services in Spain, intended as a response to would-be Nazi invasion of the peninsula; some Carlists in Vascongadas, Navarre and Andalusia might have been involved, triggering alarm among Franco’s security services. When on exile in Menorca Fal sent his own personal envoy to investigate the issue, Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 270-1. Some scholars claim that Fal was against any pro-British action; Joaquín Baleztena – with approval if not on demand of Fal – opposed an idea to turn Requeté into a British espionage service, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 268-9. There are scholars, however, who claim exactly the opposite; a Carlist tercio was to be formed under Fal’s auspices to fight alongside the Allies against the Nazis, Clemente 2011, p. 223, Pérez-Nievas 1999, p. 146; the source quoted is María Teresa de Borbón Parma. Another version pertaining to Fal’s exile is that it was triggered by his refusal to call the Carlists to join Division Azul, Josep Carles Clemente, ''Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo'', Barcelona 1977, {{ISBN|9788425307591}}, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in 4-month-long [[Ferreries]] exile in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;the question of Fal’s exile is rather confused. Some authors claim it was limited to Menorca and lasted 3-4 months, between October and Christmas 1941, see Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 48, Canal 2000, p. 349. Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 270 provides ambiguous account which suggests he was released in 1942 or even later. Some claim that Fal was repeatedly ordered periods of exile, namely in Chiclana (1940), Menorca (1941) and Chipiona (1942), Clemente 2011, p. 223, Clemente 2013, p. 32. Another rather obscure issue is a possible assassination attempt on Fal, mounted allegedly by Serrano and the Nazis; the dates given are fall of 1941, see Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 270, or spring of 1942, see Vallverdú 2014, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Seville Fal was occasionally allowed to travel and was present during the massive [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]] gatherings in 1942&lt;ref&gt;ending in riots and clashes between Carlists and Falangists, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; and 1945.&lt;ref&gt;during the Montserrat aplec of 1945, so far the largest Carlist gathering in Francoist Spain (some 30,000 attendants), Fal threatened with a new war in case liberal monarchy of Juan de Borbón is established, Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 252-3&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 he co-engineered ''Reclamación del poder'', another memorandum signed by many Carlists and left unanswered by Franco.&lt;ref&gt;Payne 1987, p. 328, Alfonso Ballestero, ''José Ma de Oriol y Urquijo'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788483569160}}, p. 80, Vallverdú 2014, p. 96. The document declared "la discrepancia mantenida por la Comunión con el ensayo totalitario, y su apartamiento del ‘partido único’, base del sistema" and stated that "en la zona nacional no había ni sombra de Estado; fue la sociedad misma, movida por sentimientos profundos y eternos que le daban unidad y vida, la que hizo posible el Movimiento. Hay que tener fe en esta sociedad y respetar su repugnancia a sistemas que la violentan. Es innegable que la Sociedad española no acepta el sistema totalitario." It maintained that "la necesidad y la urgencia de proceder a un cambio de cosas es evidente" and "tan acusado es el clamor unánime de la nación que ni nuestro prolongado silencio ha podido evitar que se alcen voces de bienintencionados españoles, no todos autorizados políticamente para discrepar del régimen ni para interpretar el que necesita España", finally demanding that "entregado a esta gloriosa Comunión para que instaure el orden definitivo y nacional inspirado en el pensamiento tradicionalista", quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 244, Clemente 2013, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; According to an unsure source, in 1944 he supported an aborted monarchist plot to depose the dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 298-300&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1945 Fal addressed Franco with a conciliatory personal letter; sort of acknowledging Falangist regime, but presenting Traditionalism as the unique long-term solution, he asked for release from confinement.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 300, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The house arrest was indeed lifted in November 1945;&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt; during the 6-year long period of detention Fal went on practicing as a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;the letter from the civil governor to Fal sort of apologised that 2 uniformed policemen in front of his house might have discouraged customers of his law office, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 306&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurgence and demise==

In December 1945 [[Valencia]] and Pamplona were rocked by Carlist riots; some speculate that they were pre-planned as a revolt against Franco.&lt;ref&gt;Aurora Villanueva Martínez, ''Los incidentes del 3 de diciembre de 1945 en la Plaza del Castillo'', [in:] ''Principe de Viana'' 58 (1997), pp. 629–650, Manuel de Santa Cruz [Alberto Ruiz de Galarreta], ''Apuntes y documentos para la historia del tradicionalismo español (1939-1966)'', Madrid, 1984-1991, vol. 7, p. 155 and onwards. The moment was peculiar; following the end of World War Two many assumed that victorious Allies would inevitably topple Franco, considered last fascist standing, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 304-5&lt;/ref&gt; Fal's presence is unsure;&lt;ref&gt;though allegedly he was planned to be there, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 318; there is no proof of his presence, though Alfonso Carlos Fal-Conde Macias maintained that his father was present, Villanueva Martínez 1997, pp. 630, 649&lt;/ref&gt; 3 weeks later he met Don Javier in [[San Sebastián]];&lt;ref&gt;first time since 1937, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 319&lt;/ref&gt; he also wrote to [[Juan de Borbon|Don Juan]], inviting him to recognize the regency.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Soon Fal commenced visiting provincial party structures; the exercise climaxed in monthly tour across the North in September 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 320, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Considering re-organization complete, in 1947 he assembled 48 local jefes in Madrid, the first such meeting since Insua.&lt;ref&gt;among the present were José María Lamamié de Clairac y de la Colina, Juan Antonio de Olazábal, José Luis Zamanillo-Camino, José María Valiente Soriano, Gutiérrez Colomer y González Pons, Juan Sáenz Díez, Marcial Solana, Manuel Senante, Máximo Palomar, Ramón Contreras, Mauricio de Sivatte, Pedro Gaviria, conde de Samatier, José María Barber, Luis Ortiz Estrada, José Quint Zaforteza, Calixto González-Quevedo, Fernando López Barranco, Juan J. Palomino, marqués de Santa Rosa, Guillermo Galmés, José María García Verde, Joaquín Purón, Antonio Garzón, José María Onrubia, Miguel Fagogaga, Tomás Barreiro and José Javier Pérez Bultó, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; The gathering re-established Carlist executive, Consejo Nacional. ''La única solución'',&lt;ref&gt;full title ''La única solución (Llamamiento de la Comunión Tradicionalista con la concreción práctica de sus principios. Con ocasión de la presión internacional y el cerco de la ONU. Inminente Ley de Sucesión)''; the document protested also international ostracism towards Spain. Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 321-2; 374&lt;/ref&gt; a document released afterwards, confirmed non-collaborative stance versus Francoism,&lt;ref&gt;according to the document, "el régimen de Caudillaje" does not have "ni caracteres de estabilidad ni raiz española, por ser un régimen de poder personal, inconciliable con los derechos de la persona humana y de las entidades infrasoberanas en que aquella se desenvuelve"&lt;/ref&gt; Juanismo&lt;ref&gt;this has not always been the case. In late 1934 he was quoted as declaring to a small sircle of supporters that "la ley de sucesión determina el derecho a ocupar el trono a favor de don Juan de Borbón", though he noted also that "si don Juan no deja de ser lo que es, no podra ocupar el trono legitimo", quoted after Francisco de las Heras y Borrero, ''Un pretendiente desconocido. Carlos de Habsburgo. El otro candidato de Franco'', Madrid 2004, {{ISBN|8497725565}}, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Carloctavismo]].&lt;ref&gt;already in 1943 Fal expulsed the Carloctavistas from Carlism, Canal 2000, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt; Addressing a massively attended Montserrat aplec of 1947&lt;ref&gt;during the Montserrat aplec of 1946 Fal delivered a vehemently anti-communist address; Franco liked it so much that he offered Fal the San Sebastián bullring to hold a meeting, MacClancy 2000, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; seemed to demonstrate that Carlism was getting back in shape.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 322, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 50; text of his address Clemente 2013, pp. 100-105&lt;/ref&gt;

Leadership of Fal was coming under fire from two groups. The [[Maurici de Sivatte i de Bobadilla|Sivattistas]] suspected that by supporting overdue regency Fal intended to ensure the crown for Borbón-Parmas by appeasing Franco.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, pp. 43, 59-62; 67, 71-72, Vallverdú 2014, esp. the chapter ''L’enfrontament Sivatte – Fal Conde'', pp. 106-111; the moment which caused particular tension was the spring of 1948, when the annual Montserrat aplec was banned by the authorities; Sivatte accused Fal not only of mild compliance, but also of not uttering a single word of protest, Alcalá 2001, pp. 82-3&lt;/ref&gt; They were enraged by Fal's recommendation to support [[:es:Ley de Sucesión en la Jefatura del Estado|Ley de Sucesión]] in referendum, considering it unacceptable backing of the regime,&lt;ref&gt;Sivatte claimed that even voting "no" in the referendum was improper; the only correct path was to ignore all Francoist referenda, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 27, Alcalá 2001, pp. 74-80&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded that a new Carlist king is declared.&lt;ref&gt;Alcalá 2001, pp. 56-60; the most logical choice, also according to Sivatte, would have been Don Javier himself. Also the Navarros, though not as militant as Sivatte, were disappointed by Fal’s refusal to call a grand Carlist assembly, which would declare a new king; in November 1944 the entire Navarrese junta resigned in protest, Villanueva 1998, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the possibilists were getting tired of what they perceived as ineffective intransigency and lack of legal outposts, recommending more flexible attitude.&lt;ref&gt;already in 1945 the first signs of dissent started to appear: [[José María Araúz de Robles Estremera|Arauz de Robles]] worked out a document, ''Acta de Unión Nacional para la restauración de la Monarquía Tradicional en España'', in which he called for a broad union against totalitarian designs, naming Fal as the one who clung to exclusivist Carlist strategy, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; Though in 1948 Consejo de la Tradicion confirmed non-collaborationist strategy,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; in 1949 some voices called for a more active stance, especially following news of Franco's negotiations with Don Juan.&lt;ref&gt;especially that at the turn of the decades international pressure eased, the Francoist regime seemed consolidated and speculations about Franco’s imminent removal faded away, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:RequeteViladot.JPG|thumbnail|160px|[[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Don Javier]] as king on the cover of a Carlist periodical, 1950s]]
Fal's reaction was multifold. On the one hand, he fought back militant dissenters like Sivatte.&lt;ref&gt;for review of mounting tension between Fal and Sivatte, leading to the latter being dismissed from Catalan jefatura in 1949, see Alcalá 2001, pp. 84-91, Vallverdú 2014, pp. 111-113. The dismissal note read:Excmo. Sr. D. Mauricio de Sivatte, Barcelona. Por tu actitud indisciplinada me veo en la necessidad de dimitirte y te ordeno hagas entrega del cargo, ficheros, documentación y medios económicos a la persona o Junta que yo lo comunique. Francisco Javier de Borbón", quoted after Alcalá 2001, p. 94, the same text in Vallverdú 2014, p. 112. Sivatte’s successor was José Puig Pellicer, Clemente 1977, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, he tried to address questions raised. Intending to broaden the party's room for maneuvering, he permitted individual Carlists&lt;ref&gt;Carlism as a movement abstained from taking part in elections&lt;/ref&gt; to run in local elections,&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; especially that in some provinces the movement effectively competed for power with Falange.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 218-226, At that time competition for power between the Falangists and the Carlists was taking place in all 4 vasco-navarrese provinces. For Navarre see Maria del Mar Larazza Micheltorena, Alvaro Baraibar Etxeberria, ''La Navarra sotto il Franchismo: la lotta per il controllo provinciale tra i governatori civili e la Diputacion Foral (1945-1955)'', [in:] ''Nazioni e Regioni'', Bari 2013, pp. 101-120, Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Navarra 1937-1939: el fiasco de la Unificación'', [in:] ''Príncipe de Viana'' 69 (2008), pp. 429-458.

At that time Carlism controlled fully only one daily, the Pamplona-based ''El Pensamiento Navarro'' (disguised as commercial enterprise), with other periodicals issued by various combatant or quasi-religious associations, like ''Requetés'', ''Tiempos Críticos'', ''Boletín de Orientación Tradicionalista'', ''Monarquía Popular'', ''Boina Roja'' and other&lt;/ref&gt; the title later served as an unofficial Carlist tribune.&lt;ref&gt;when it was taken over by the Alfonsinos. Its staff included Manuel Cerezales, husband of Carmen Laforet, the Juan José y José Luis Peña Ibáñez brothers and José Goñi Aizpurua. Apart from the issuing the newspaper, the company remained an important Carlist Madrid outpost with a meeting hall, periodical conferences and other social activity going beyond journalism&lt;/ref&gt; Student and worker groupings, AET and MOT, recorded increased activity.&lt;ref&gt;when discussing AET and MOT dynamism in the early 1950s, scholars fail to mention Fal as a person engineering or encouraging this activity, compare Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 328-331. In 1954 it was Fal who nominated [[Ramón Massó Tarruella|Ramón Massó]], the future leader of Hugocarlistas, as jefe of AET, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 392, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 75. He kept corresponding with Massó also in the late 1960s, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Though in 1951 Fal tried to keep low profile of Don Javier's tour across [[Levante, Spain|Levante]],&lt;ref&gt;that proved hardly possible as news of the Carlist king arriving leaked out, prompting crowds to welcome their monarch to embarrassment of both Don Javier and Fal, Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 338–39&lt;/ref&gt; all this changed in 1952: during [[Eucharistic Congress]] in [[Barcelona]] Don Javier claimed his rights as a king&lt;ref&gt;in as usual ambiguous terms; Don Javier avoided direct language and stated literally that "he resuelto asumir la realeza de las Coronas de España en sucesión del último Rey", quoted after Canal 2000, p. 354. Though Fal for 15 years opposed terminating the regency, in 1952 it was he who convinced Don Javier to declare himself king; one scholar considers Acto de Barcelona "l’obra mestra de Fal, [which] avivá el carlisme i aillá la Comunió del perill contaminant del joanisme i del franquisme", Vallverdú 2014, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; before having been promptly expulsed from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, pp. 339–40, Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt;

As Don Javier soon backtracked on the so-called Acto de Barcelona and Franco's regime showed no signs of cracking, the non-collaborative policy of the Falcondistas was increasingly looking like a dead end street. The so-called "duros" advocated a decisive anti-Francoist course,&lt;ref&gt;like [[Antonio Arrúe Zarauz|Antonio Arrúe]], the Baleztena brothers, Elías Querejeta, Ignacio Ruiz de la Prada or Pablo Iturria, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; the so-called "unionistas" opted for rapprochement towards the regime and possibly a dynastical accord with Alfonsinos,&lt;ref&gt;like Rafael Olazábal or José María Araúz de Robles, Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 392, see also Mercedes Vázquez de Prada, ''El final de una ilusión. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967)'', Madrid 2016, {{ISBN|9788416558407}}, pp. 33-34&lt;/ref&gt; some in the party called for a "tercera vía"&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 340; presumably it stood for a third way between collaboration and opposition.&lt;/ref&gt; and many complained about Fal's "estilo autoritario".&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Vázquez de Prada Tiffe, ''La reorganización del carlismo vasco en los sesenta: entre la pasividad y el "separatismo"'', [in:] ''Vasconia. Cuadernos de Historia-Geografía'', 38 (2012), p. 1115. Witness to the above is the Carlist political programme for 1954, ambiguous and self-contradictory. E.g., when it comes to Falange or the royal role of don Javier, see [https://centrodeestudiosgeneralzumalacarregui.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/posicion-politica-de-la-comunion-tradicionalista-en-1954.pdf here]. Some scholars claim that long personal command of Fal left the Carlist executive inoperational, as "nadie se entendia con nadie", 
Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Fal himself has run out of steam; in his July 1955 letter to Franco he seemed settled for the perspective of mere survival of Carlism.&lt;ref&gt;"En general, en toda España se nota en el Carlismo el efecto del cansancio. Ciertamente que no han podido nuestros adversarios hacernos desaparecer. En ningún país del mundo, bajo los totalitarismos, han perdurado los partidos de oposición ni siquiera cinco años. En España, por asistencia de Dios a esta nobilísima Causa, aún existimos al cabo de diecinueve años en que nos faltan los medios precisamente vitales: la prensa, los actos de propaganda, los círculos, la libertad de constitución de Juntas, etc." quoted after Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Though he remained in perfect understanding with Don Javier and until that moment the terms "Falcondistas" and "Javieristas" were used interchangeably,&lt;ref&gt;compare Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; also the Carlist king felt that Carlism needed a new leader. In August 1955 Fal resigned&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 393; resignation was in fact suggested by Don Javier. It came as a surprise, since earlier that year Fal staged many warm meetings with the royal family, e.g. in Seville, Lourdes and San Sebastián, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 53. According to some accounts Don Javier sacked Fal in a cowardly and backhand manner, MacClancy 2000, p. 87, the version difficult to reconcile with later continuously cordial relations between Fal and his king. Franco was delighted to hear the news, convinced that Carlism would soon be domesticated "una vez eliminado ese hombre, intolerante, intransigente y dominante", quoted after Manuel Martorell Pérez, ''Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La solución federal para España que Franco rechazó'', Madrid 2014, {{ISBN|9788477682653}}, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; as Jefe Delegado.&lt;ref&gt;so far he is the longest-serving Carlist political leader, with 21 years at the helm of the organisations. Out of other historical leaders (regardless of their formal title), Cerralbo headed Carlism for 15 years, Valiente 13, Villores 11, Carlos Hugo 11, Barrio 10, Nocedal 6, Feliu 3, Rodezno 2, Larramendi 2, Comin 1 and Sanz 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retiree==
[[File:Don Javier 1960.jpg|thumbnail|160px|left|Don Javier, 1960]]
Following his resignation Fal took a step back from daily politics&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 60; however, he remained moderately active in private, compare references to his correspondence with members of the Carlist executive in the 1960s, noted in Vázquez de Prada 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and functioned as honorary member, sporadically invited to sittings of Carlist executive as late as 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; He remained loyal to the new Communion leader, [[José María Valiente Soriano|Valiente]],&lt;ref&gt;he was initially heading Secreteria Nacional and was appointed jefe delegado in 1960, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 12, 79&lt;/ref&gt; even given the latter embarked on new, collaborationist strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; Though continuously anti-Francoist, he avoided uncompromising radicalism. On the one hand, in 1956 he opposed backtracking on Acto de Barcelona, demanded by the Francoist authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; On the other, when consulted about planned appearance of Carlos Hugo at Montejurra in 1957, he spoke to the negative, warning about a violent reaction from Franco.&lt;ref&gt;Martorell Pérez 2009, p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Though his advice was ignored, he maintained good relations with Carlos Hugo&lt;ref&gt;he was many times visited in his Seville home by Carlos Hugo and his sisters, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; and was consulted on his 1958 Montejurra address.&lt;ref&gt;Fal was generally approving though he considered references to a federal Europe excessive, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Upon first signs of breakup between Progressists and Traditionalists Fal praised Carlos Hugo for ousting [[José Luis Zamanillo González-Camino|Zamanillo]] in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;MacClancy 2000, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; He attended some Montejurra aplecs, turning into the prince's promotional stage, himself; in 1963 he needed assistance when climbing the summit.&lt;ref&gt;but was greeted with enthusiasm by the crowd, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 57. Carlos Hugo, not yet ready for an open challenge and unveiled promotion of his socialist outlook, insisted on Fal’s presence to sustain his Traditionalist credentials, put into question by expulsing Zamanillo one year earlier, MacClancy 2000, p. 148. Out of Carlist annual gatherings of that time Fal preferred the Andalusian Quintillo over Catalan Montserrat or Navarrese Montejurra. However, though through most of his political career Fal either was pitted against the Navarrese leaders (like Rodezno) or at best remained in most circumspect co-operation with them (like [[Joaquín Baleztena Ascárate|Baleztena]]), he retained great respect for Navarre and its spirit, see his comments in Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 290-1&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s he recommended publication of a "libro blanco", advancing the Borbón-Parma claim.&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 258-259&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 Don Javier made Fal Duque de Quintillo, [[Grandee of Spain]],&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 58, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; an exceptional honor as it was the only case of Don Javier granting a noble title to anyone beyond the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de las Heras Borrero, ''Derecho premial de los reyes carlistas'', [in:] ''Cuadernos de Ayala'' 39 (2009), p. 9; unlike most titles granted by Carlist kings, this one has not been recognized either by Franco of by post-Francoist Spain&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the elevation, cordial relations between Fal and his king were deteriorating.&lt;ref&gt;already in the early 1960s Fal refused to join a planned Consejo Privado of Don Javier. Eventually the body failed to materialize, Daniel Jesús García Riol, ''La resistencia tradicionalista a la renovación ideológica del carlismo (1965-1973)'' [PhD thesis UNED], Madrid 2015, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting health reasons, Fal did not attend the ducado ceremony in [[Fátima, Portugal|Fatima]].&lt;ref&gt;on grounds of his health Fal refused to attend the act of elevation to Duque de Quntillo, arranged in Fatima; it was his son Domingo Fal-Conde Macias who representing him, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Though Don Javier and Carlos Hugo urged him to recommend supporting [[:es:Ley Orgánica del Estado|Ley Orgánica]] in the [[:es:Referéndum sobre la Ley Orgánica del Estado|1966 referendum]], Fal agreed to recommend participation,&lt;ref&gt;Vázquez de Prada 2016, pp. 293-293&lt;/ref&gt; but clinging to his anti-Francoism he refused to endorse the law.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 58; he noted that as the proposed might have pursued a hidden agenda related to the Juanist restoration, the Comunion should refrain from recommending either a "yes" or a "no" vote, Vázquez de Prada 2016, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; When in 1968 the Borbón-Parmas were expulsed from Spain, Fal resisted their repeated requests to meet Franco seeking reversal of the decision and responded that he had no reason to pay a penitent visit to the dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 59; the animosity was fully mutual and on Franco’s part included petty malignancy. In 1968 Ministry of Justice refused to honor Fal with customary golden medal, celebrating 50 years of his career as a lawyer, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 58. Instead, one year later the Seville Colegio de Abogados made him decano honorario, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; In wide correspondence he expressed concern about the socialist stand of Carlos Hugo of the late 1960s. Despite mounting doubts, he did not join those turned against the dynasty, like Zamanillo or [[Francisco Elías de Tejada y Spínola|Elias de Tejada]];&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in 1968 he voiced against rapprochement with Sivatte, Zamanillo (former Falcondista, expulsed from the Comunión by Hugocarlistas in the early 1960s) or Elias de Tejada, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 185; as late as 1972 he defended loyalty to the dynasty against the dissidents, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 231&lt;/ref&gt; when in 1970 the prince ordered termination of collaboration with ''[[:es:El Pensamiento Navarro|El Pensamiento Navarro]]'', re-claimed by orthodox Traditionalists, Fal complied.&lt;ref&gt;Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 61; he did not join the plot consisting of setting up [[Hermandad de Maestrazgo]] as a breakup Carlist grouping intended to wrest power away from Don Carlos Hugo and his entourage, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 234-6&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly embittered by cancellation of annual Quintillo remembrance act in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;according to one source, the newly created Partido Carlista adopted a clandestine format and considered staging public celebrations in Qunitillo incompatible with this policy, Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 60-1. The Montejurra gatherings went on, though with drastically diminishing attendance; it was down from 100,000 in the late 1960s to some 10,000 in 1973, MacClancy 2000, p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 he considered himself dynastically loyal to Don Javier, but in disagreement with his political line.&lt;ref&gt;and with a number of other similarly minded Carlists, like Raimundo de Miguel, intended to write a collective letter to the king; the idea was to deliver the message of dynastic loyalty and ideological disagreement, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 276-9; The contents of his last political letter to Don Javier, written in 1973, is not known, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 61. On grounds of loyalty to the king, Fal kept defending Don Javier against attacks of Sivatte as late as 1973, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974 Fal lost any illusions as to the Leftist turn of the Borbón-Parmas.&lt;ref&gt;in his 1974 letter he dubbed cursillos, organized by socialist Partido Carlista for its young militants, "brainwashing", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Carlos Hugo 1970.jpg|thumbnail|160px|[[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma|Don Carlos Hugo]], 1970]]
Throughout all his life Fal was a fervent Catholic, receiving [[Communion (sacrament)|communion]] every day even when visiting frontlines during the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Jacek Bartyzel, ''Manuel (José) Fal Conde'', [in:] ''legitymizm.org'' service, available [http://www.legitymizm.org/spw-manuel-fal-conde here]&lt;/ref&gt; When released from political duties he was dedicating even more time to religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;he remained on very close if not cordial terms with cardenal Segura until the latter’s death, the two driven together by similarly Integrist, holistic vision of religion and politics. Fal is one of key protagonists in Martínez Sánchez 2000&lt;/ref&gt; He co-founded religious associations,&lt;ref&gt;like La Confianza en el Corazón de Jesus in Higuera&lt;/ref&gt; accepted posts in others&lt;ref&gt;like Sevillan branch of Congregación de las Obreras del Corazón&lt;/ref&gt; and was active in Andalusian initiatives of various orders.&lt;ref&gt;the Jesuits, Claretians, Sisters of Adoration, Salesians and other orders, Marín, Burgueño 1978, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; He headed Editorial Católica Española&lt;ref&gt;the publishing house he co-founded back in 1938 with Segura, Canal 2000, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt; and launched Premio Vedruna,&lt;ref&gt;in 1965 its first recipient was Rafael Gambra, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 38, Manuel Santa Cruz [Alberto Ruiz de Galarreta], ''Rafael Gambra. Un hombre cabal'', [in:] ''Anales de la Fundación Francisco Elías de Tejada'' 2004 (10), pp. 177-8&lt;/ref&gt; though remained perplexed by new course of the [[Holy See|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;commenting on increasingly progressist attitude of Spanish bishops, Fal wrote about "la obra del liberalismo, el diabólico efecto de la política que interviene en la presentación, el presupuesto de clero, los favores oficiales, coche y chaufer", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s "Don Manuel" enjoyed patriarch status in the realm of Andalusian Catholicism&lt;ref&gt;his vision of Carlism became increasingly religion-focused. In the 1973 letter he wrote: "we used to say that where is a rifle and an arm to raise it, there is Carlism. Now we can say it is where a tabernacle and a person to adore it are", quoted after Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; and among Traditionalist Carlists nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;receiving massive homage correspondence during various anniversaries, Marín, Burgueño 1978, pp. 60-63; in 1974 Fal was even visited in his Seville home by his former arch-enemy, Sivatte, who intended to invite Fal to an anti-Hugocarlista initiative, Alcalá 2001, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; He remained emotionally attached to Don Javier. Fal died one month after his abidcation.

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:ToledoElecciones15Jun77.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Spanish general election, 1977|Elections in Spain, 1977]]]]
As political event the death of Fal was soon eclipsed by the just commencing [[Spanish transition to democracy]]. In the late 1970s and the 1980s his memory was subject to competition on part of the socialist [[Carlist Party (1970)|Partido Carlista]] and various breeds of Traditionalism, especially as they engaged in bitter political struggle. Followers of Don Carlos Hugo presented Fal focusing on his loyalty to Borbón-Parmas and on his anti-Francoism, attempting to mount him in their overall vision of Carlism as a popular class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. recollections of María Teresa de Borbón: when mentioning "amigos que venían a casa" she mentions in one go "Fal Conde, el padre Arturo Juncosa, José María de Zavala y Josep Carles Clemente", placing Fal among most hardline socialist progressists, quoted after Clemente 1999, p. 87. Most works of Clemente himself are good example of presenting Fal as supporter of Carlos Hugo and his vision of "popular Carlism". In his most notorious exercise Clemente presented short biographical portraits of Carlist leaders suiting his vision grouped as "Retratos populares del carlismo", while the others were presented under the heading "Retablo de traidores"; Fal was within the first group, Clemente 2011, pp. 220-224. Somewhat different approach is presented by another socialist from Partido Carlista, who shows little sympathy for Fal as an Integrist who together with Alfonso Carlos undid the progressist work of Don Jaime, Pérez-Nievas 1999, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionalists, including Fal's sons, reclaimed him as fervent Catholic and a conservative who guarded genuine Carlist orthodoxy against Francoism but has also never approved of the socialist turn of the hugocarlistas.&lt;ref&gt;compare José Miguel Gambra, leader of CTC, quoting Fal on the issue of Catholic unity, see ''carlismo.es'' service available [http://carlismo.es/jose-miguel-gambra-sobre-la-reciente-declaracion-de-la-comunion-tradicionalista/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; These two visions, offered by militants of both groupings, keep contending until today.&lt;ref&gt;compare the progressist site quoting Fal say "no son los pueblos por los reyes, sino los reyes por los pueblos", available [http://www.legitimistadigital.com/2015/01/bases-de-accion-carlista-anticapitalista.html here], and the Traditionalist site quoting Fal say "ante Dios nunca serás héroe anónimo", available [http://carlismo.es/devocionario-del-requete/ here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Fal started to figure prominently in historiography in the 1990s, and until today there have been numerous articles published in specialized reviews, dedicated either to particular episodes or to certain dimensions of his activity.&lt;ref&gt;compare María Cruz Rubio Liniers, María Talavera Díaz, ''Bibliografías de Historia de España'', vol. XIII: ''El carlismo'', Madrid 2012, {{ISBN|9788400090135}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he gained no full-blown scholarly monograph so far. Two books dedicated to Fal and published in 1978 and 1998 are formatted as homage rather than as scientific historical works.&lt;ref&gt;anonymous ''In memoriam Manuel J. Fal Conde'', Sevilla 1978, reprinted as Ana Marín Fidaldo, Manuel M. Burgueño, ''In memoriam. Manuel J. Fal Conde (1894-1975)'', Sevilla 1980, and Ricardo Martínez de Salazar y Bascuñana, ''Manuel J. Fal Conde. La política como servicio de Dios y España'', Cadiz 1998. It is also useful to mention monographical issue of ''Aportes'' 27 (1995), dedicated to Fal&lt;/ref&gt; He is usually presented as an intransigent opponent of Franco.&lt;ref&gt;MacClancy 2000, pp. 76-7, Ismael Saz, ''Fascismo y franquismo'', Valencia 2004, {{ISBN|9788437059105}}, p. 132, Concha Langa Nuño, ''De cómo se improvisó el franquismo durante la Guerra Civil: la aportación del ABC de Sevilla'', Valencia 2007, {{ISBN|9788461153336}}, p. 15, Gonzalo Alvarez Chillida, ''José María Pemán: pensamiento y trayectoria de un monárquico (1897-1941)'', Cadíz 1996, {{ISBN|9788477863052}}, p. 102, Gonzalo Redondo, ''Historia de la Iglesia en España, 1931-1939: La Guerra Civil, 1936-1939'', Madrid 1993, {{ISBN|9788432130168}}, p. 204, Raymond Carr, Juan Pablo Fusi Aizpurúa, ''España, de la dictadura a la democracia'', Madrid 1979, {{ISBN|9788432056512}}, p. 50, Enrique Moradiellos, ''Franco frente a Churchill'', Madrid 2007, {{ISBN|9788497110211}}, p. 205. There are exceptions, though. Some authors claim that Fal and Don Javier were actually supporting Franco; according to this view, they courted the dictator by maintaining regency and refraining from claiming royal title for Don Javier; the objective was to ensure instauration of Carlos Hugo as the Francoist king , Alcalá 2001, pp. 71-78, 148&lt;/ref&gt; He is generally recognized for excellent organizational skills, especially during early years of his leadership,&lt;ref&gt;Vallverdú 2008, p. , p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; though there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;some scholars praise rather his key antagonist Rodezno for pragmatism, as "compared to Rodezno’s pragmatic strategy, Fal Conde’s was sheer wishful thinking", Blinkhorn 2008, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Fal is usually not acclaimed as a theorist; some students tend to view him as an inflexible doctrinaire,&lt;ref&gt;the view prevailing among students sympathetic to those Carlists who commenced collaboration with Franco, compare references to "intransigencia doctrinal que mostraban Fal Conde y don Javier", Ballestero 2014, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; those who do not underline his Integrist, holistic vision of politics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 162-3&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Montejurra San Cipriano.jpg|thumbnail|[[Montejurra]], 2014]]
In popular discourse Fal, unlike most Carlist political leaders, has generally evaded usual lambasting as "fascista" or "reaccionario". Newspaper pieces claim that he "revived popular character of Carlism" and even maintain that his vision contained threads which could have contributed to "reencuentro de España", but were lost in "tiempos de intolerancia".&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.05.15&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, naming of a major throughway street honoring Fal in Sevilla was contested; some historians&lt;ref&gt;like [[:es:Leandro Álvarez Rey|Leandro Álvarez Rey]] or [[:es:Francisco Espinosa Maestre|Francisco Espinosa Maestre]], see César Rufino, ''El fascismo contra la pared'', [in:] ''El Correo de Andalucia'', 15.09.09, available [http://elcorreoweb.es/el-fascismo-contra-la-pared-HEEC133613 here]&lt;/ref&gt; indicated that while in Germany and Italy apology of fascism was illegal, in Spain historical memory suffered a [[lobotomia]] and street names commemorating Fal proved that it was "sólo memoria histórica de la derecha".&lt;ref&gt;Rufino 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, in 2009 the street was renamed&lt;ref&gt;''Diario de Sevilla'' 14.05.09, available [http://www.diariodesevilla.es/article/sevilla/423610/aprobado/oficialmente/cambio/nombre/calles/nomenclator/sevilla.html here]; it now honours Victoria Dominguez Cerrato, local community activist from the Poligono Sur quarter of Seville, compare [http://www.asociacionentreamigos.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13:carrera-popular&amp;catid=15&amp;Itemid=121 here]&lt;/ref&gt; with Fal's name retained only in a short adjacent drive.&lt;ref&gt;to have a glance, compare [https://www.google.ru/maps/@37.3570139,-5.9721044,3a,75y,233.95h,86.86t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssk-7MJ8UAgEHDc_ELFOX4g!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20004">'''Mayoral control of schools''' is governance over [[American schools]] based on the business model, in which the [[mayor]] of a city replaces an elected [[board of education]] (school board) with an appointed board.  The mayor may also directly appoint the head of the school system, called the [[CEO of public schools|CEO]], superintendent or chancellor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Resmovits |first=Joy |title=Taking Schools Into Their Own Hands |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=August 16, 2010 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704268004575417301793522096}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also known as '''integrated governance''', mayoral control of schools is in contrast to the structure it replaces: an elected board that governs schools independently from the formal influence of the mayor.&lt;ref name="Wong"&gt;Wong, Kenneth K., et al. The Education Mayor: Improving America's Schools. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayors governs the school districts in two of the United States' three largest cities: [[Chicago]] (since 1995) and [[New York City]] (since 2002). Mayors also control various other medium-to-large districts as well, including [[District of Columbia Public Schools]].  According to a survey of school board members compiled for the [[National School Board Association]], 96 percent of respondents report that membership on their board is determined by election.&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Frederick M., "School Boards at the Dawn of the 21st Century: Conditions and Challenges of District Governance." Alexandria, VA: National School Boards Association, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 2011, evidence of existing or attempted mayoral control was found in about 20 major districts around the United States.&lt;ref name="Education Commission of the States"&gt;{{cite web |author=Education Commission of the States |authorlink=Education Commission of the States |title=Local School Boards |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url=http://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=170 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20141208221651/http://mb2.ecs.org/reports/Report.aspx?id=170 |archivedate=December 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most high-profile case of mayoral control is [[New York City]] where [[Michael Bloomberg]] won the right to appoint the head of schools in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Goodnough |first = Abby |newspaper =[[New York Times]] |title=Justice Dept. Allows a Shift in School Powers |date=September 4, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite limited reach, there are a plethora of mayoral controlled governance structures. In Chicago, the mayor appoints the CEO (superintendent) as well as the entire school board. In [[Washington, DC]],  the mayor has power to directly select the chancellor, who must be confirmed by the city council. All D.C. state board of education members are elected but the state board of education acts in a largely advisory capacity to the state education agency. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mitsloan.mit.edu/LearningEdge/strategy/DCPublicSchoolsA/Pages/Management-Principles-and-the-Washington,-DC-Public-Schools.aspx|title=Management Principles and the Washington DC Public Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;New York’s mayor also has the power to select the head of schools, in addition to appointing eight of thirteen school board members.  In Boston, the mayor’s powers extend only to appointing a committee from a list of nominees. It is this appointed board that is entrusted with the job of selecting a superintendent of schools.&lt;ref name="Viteritti"&gt;Viteritti, Joseph P., ed. When Mayors Take Charge: School Governance in the City. Washington, DC: The Brookings Institution, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of mayoral control of schools ==

According to scholar Deborah Land of [[Johns Hopkins University]], the origins of a system in which lay individuals were given the authority to govern their local schools dates back more than 200 years.&lt;ref name="Land"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Deborah |last=Land |title=Local School Boards Under Review: Their Role and Effectiveness in Relation to Students’ Academic Achievement |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=72 |number=2 |year=2002 |page=230 |doi=10.3102/00346543072002229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From the inception of school boards, there was skepticism about the ability of distant politicians to see and meet the needs of local neighborhoods when it came to education.  As a result, boards of education were morphed over time to ensure maximum local control of schools.  It was believed that separating governance of schools from state and local elected officials was the best way to realize the [[Progressive Era]] vision of schools protected from politics.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, Jeffrey R., and Wilbur C. Rich.  Mayors in the Middle: Politics, Race, and Mayoral Control of Urban Schools. Princeton, NJ: Princeton UP, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend toward mayoral control represents a reversal of this trend, with arguments for and against discussed in a later section.

While mayoral control in some cities such as [[Jackson, Mississippi]], has existed since the mid-20th century,&lt;ref name="Favro"&gt;Favro, Tony. "[http://www.citymayors.com/education/usa_schoolboards.html US Mayors are Divided about Merits of Controlling Schools]." ''USA Editor'', 2 Feb. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; most shifts from elected to appointed school boards took place after 1990.&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;  Starting in the 1990s, mayoral control was viewed by its supporters as a way to address the chronic underperformance and jumpstart reforms in medium to large urban districts.  The first major urban district to move toward mayoral control of schools was Boston, where, in 1991, the Massachusetts governor and legislature approved a petition allowing the mayor to appoint a seven-member board, which then appointed a superintendent of schools.&lt;ref name="Favro" /&gt; The latest high-profile urban district to move under mayoral control was Washington, DC, where Mayor [[Adrian Fenty]] won the right to select the chancellor of schools in 2007.&lt;ref name="oust"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/11/AR2007061102383.html|title=Fenty To Oust Janey Today|first=David |last=Nakamura|date=June 12, 2007|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The table below shows the school districts that are now under the governance of mayor-appointed boards and, in some cases, mayor-appointed heads of schools.

Other locations have varying degrees of mayoral control over schools: in [[Oakland, California]], three of the 10 members of the [[Oakland Unified School District]]  board members are appointed by the mayor, and the other seven are elected.&lt;ref name="Education Commission of the States"/&gt; Mayoral control proposals have also been made in [[ Albuquerque, New Mexico]] and [[Seattle]].&lt;ref name="Favro" /&gt;
 
Notably, not all attempts at achieving mayoral control have been successful.  Mayor of Los Angeles [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] sought to bring the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] under his management, but before the plan could be brought into effect in 2007, a court ruled that it violated the [[California Constitution]].&lt;ref name="Favro"/&gt; In Detroit in the late 1990s, a reform board appointed by the mayor and governor replaced the elected board of education in response to allegations of mismanagement.  This reform was reversed in city referendum in 2005 which reinstated an elected school board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LewAllen |first=Dave |date=August 3, 2005 |url=http://www1.wxyz.com/wxyz/nw_local_news/article/0,2132,WXYZ_15924_3974896,00.html |title=Detroiters Vote for New School Board |publisher=[[WXYZ-TV]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621084200/http://www1.wxyz.com/wxyz/nw_local_news/article/0%2C2132%2CWXYZ_15924_3974896%2C00.html |archivedate=June 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments for mayoral control ==

Proponents of mayoral control point to two major reasons for shifting from an elected to appointed governance structure: the benefits of a single point of accountability and the power of sustained, aligned leadership.  On the point of accountability, supporters of mayoral control point to the extremely low turnout for often off-cycle school board elections as evidence of the lack of school board accountability and relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Finn, Chester E. and Lisa Graham Keegan. "Lost at Sea." Education Next  4.3 (2004): 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Expounding on this point, Finn and Keegan point out that in districts under mayoral control, "there is now a single, publicly accountable official in charge, rather than nine wannabe mayors immobilizing the school system with their petty squabbles, power grabs, and turf protecting. If citizens are unhappy with the schools, they can now vote the mayor out of office. This does not eliminate democratic control over the schools; it rechannels—and strengthens—it". Former appointed CEO of the mayoral controlled Chicago Public Schools and [[United States Secretary of Education|U.S. Education Secretary]] [[Arne Duncan]] has made his support for mayoral control of schools clear, offering his help to mayors who push to gain sole leadership of the schools within their cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arne Duncan: Mayors Should Run Schools |date=31 March 2009 |publisher=[[NBC Chicago]] |url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local-beat/arne-duncan-mayors-schools-033109.html |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His support is also rooted in a belief that one point of accountability—the mayor—is far more effective than accountability spread across an elected board of education model.&lt;ref&gt;"Does Mayoral Control Provide a Governance Structure that is well suited for our Schools?" Coffinseducationcenter.com. Coffins Education Center, n.d. Web. 27 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major rationale used to support mayoral control is the power of sustained, aligned leadership.  The average tenure of urban superintendents is less than four years—an unfortunate consequence of the frequent turnover in board membership and the shifting winds of local interests.&lt;ref name="Hess"&gt;Hess, Frederick M. "Assessing the Case for Mayoral Control of Urban Schools," American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research Education Outlook, no. 4 (2008): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  In cities where the mayors provide job stability for superintendents and focus the energy of the public and private sectors of a city on designated education priorities, the theory goes that more will be accomplished in areas ranging from improving student achievement to ensuring sound fiscal management.&lt;ref&gt;Gutstein, Eric and Pauline Lipman. "Should Chicago Have an Elected Representative School Board? A Look at the Evidence." University of Illinois at Chicago.  Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  In Boston, for instance, it is reported that mayoral control "engendered continuity in leadership and a new focus on learning".&lt;ref name="Viteritti" /&gt;

== Arguments against mayoral control==

Opponents of mayoral control typically cite two major issues with the shift.  Most importantly, mayoral control represents an affront to [[democracy|democratic]], [[public participation]] in school governance.  Many worry that taking popular elections of school board members out of the school governance formula prevents local neighborhoods from having any say in how their interests are represented.&lt;ref name="Wong" /&gt;  As Hess admits, "some voices are likely to be silenced or marginalized under an appointed board".&lt;ref name="Hess" /&gt;  A related complaint focuses on the lack of [[government transparency|transparency]] that accompanies appointed [[school board]]s.  Comparing appointed school boards to the board malfeasance in private sector companies such as [[Enron]] points to the danger of having a single-minded board take control of any entity.&lt;ref name="Hess" /&gt;

Overall, the question of whether to elect or appoint boards of education requires a thoughtful consideration of the "appropriate balance" between responsiveness and responsibility.&lt;ref name="Hess" /&gt;

== Impact of mayoral control on student outcomes ==

Perhaps the most important piece of evidence in the debate between the proponents and opponents of mayoral control is whether mayoral control has measurable impacts on student achievement.  After collecting and analyzing the research on school board effectiveness produced over the past twenty-five years, scholar Deborah Land concluded that there is "not yet convincing evidence that appointment of school board members produces…greater academic achievement." &lt;ref name="Land" /&gt;  Similarly, while unwilling to dismiss the connection between strong mayoral involvement and student achievement outright, researchers at the Institute on Education Law and Policy at Rutgers University— Newark "were unable to establish conclusively that the change in governance had any causal relationship to improved performance, or that, using nationally normed test data, our [mayoral controlled] cities had greater improvements than anywhere else".&lt;ref&gt;Moscovitch, Ruth et al. "Governance and urban improvement: Lessons for New Jersey from nine cities." New Brunswick, NJ: The Institute on Educational Law and Policy, Rutgers University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an analysis of top-down market-based reform efforts in three mayoral controlled cities, Chicago, New York City and Washington DC, indicate the efforts "deliver few benefits, often harm the students they purport to help, and divert attention from a set of other, less visible policies with more promise to weaken the link between poverty and low educational attainment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=E. |last2=Long |first2=D. |date=April 22, 2013 |title=Market-Oriented Reforms' Rhetoric Trumps Reality |work=Broader, Bolder Approach to Education |publisher=[[Economic Policy Institute]] |url=http://www.boldapproach.org/rhetoric-trumps-reality |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509040215/http://www.boldapproach.org/rhetoric-trumps-reality |archivedate=May 9, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, a 2013 study by researchers at the [[Center for American Progress]] found that, of the eleven districts governed by some degree of mayoral leadership, five made substantial improvement in narrowing the student achievement gap, and four others showed progress on some measures. That same study found that mayoral control in New York City had improved the performance of African American and Latino students in fourth and eighth grade by between 1 and 3 percent annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Kenneth K.|last2=Shen|first2=Francis X.|title=Mayoral Governance and Student Achievement: How Mayor-Led Districts Are Improving School and Student Performance|url=https://cdn.americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/MayoralControl-6.pdf|publisher=The Center for American Progress|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The party was officially established in 1990, but the official website of the party traces the roots of the foundation to 1983 when an illegal terrorist group ''Turkish National Freedom Movement'' was established, which committed over 50 fire-raisings, bomb attempts and murders on regular citizens until 1989 as a rebellion against the assimilation policies of [[Todor Zhivkov]]'s communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Radical Right in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEnLCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=movement+for+rights+and+freedoms+bulgaria+terrorist&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=movement%20for%20rights%20and%20freedoms%20bulgaria%20terrorist&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After he had been set free out of the jail in 1989, [[Ahmed Dogan]], a former member of the Bulgarian communist [[secret service]] (the [[Committee for State Security]]), established the party. He headed it from its official establishment on 4 January 1990 until 19 January 2013, when a disgruntled Bulgarian Turk attacked him with a [[gas pistol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://btvnovinite.bg/article/kriminalno/oktaj-enimehmedov-vleze-v-zatvora-v-burgas.html|title=Октай Енимехмедов влезе в затвора в Бургас|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed Dogan has been openly recorded promoting changes of the international boundaries in accordance with the ethnic borders, clarifying that there are either peaceful and political means for this or military and aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://svejo.net/stories/1621803-dogan-zagovori-za-etnichesko-prekroyavane-na-balgarskite-granitsi|title=Доган заговори за етническо прекрояване на българските граници!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic or religious minority parties are not allowed according to Article 11, Paragraph 4 of the [[Constitution of Bulgaria]], but the Constitutional Court denied to ban the party in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.bg/bg/const|title=Народно събрание на Република България - Конституция|website=www.parliament.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 January 2013, [[Lyutvi Mestan|Lyutfi Mestan]] was elected as the second chairman of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=147022 |title=Mestan Succeeds Dogan as Bulgarian Ethnic Turkish Party Leader after Assassination Attempt | publisher=Novinite |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mestan was removed from power by the insistence of the founder Dogan because he had declared support for Turkey for the shot Russian airplane, then [[Erdoğan]] blacklisted Ahmed Dogan banning him from entering Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.24chasa.bg/Article/5295260|title=Турция забрани на Ахмед Доган и Пеевски да влизат на територията й (обзор)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mestan formed his own party, named [[Democrats for Responsibility, Solidarity and Tolerance]].

==Controversies==

===Ethnic nature===

On 8 October 1991, ninety-three members of Bulgaria's National Assembly&amp;nbsp;— virtually all of them affiliated with the former Communist Party&amp;nbsp;— asked the  [[constitution]]al court to declare the DPS unconstitutional citing article 11.4 of the constitution which explicitly bans political parties "formed on ethnic, racial, and religious basis".&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 April 1992, the court rejected the petition and affirmed the constitutionality of the DPS.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the DPS has been legally a part of Bulgarian political life since then, some Bulgarian nationalists, particularly the [[far-right politics|far-right]] [[Attack (political party)|National Union Attack]], continue to assert that it is anti-constitutional because it consists mainly of ethnic Turks.

However, the statute of the DPS states quite clearly that it "is an independent public and political organization, founded with the purpose of contributing to the unity of all Bulgarian citizens".&lt;ref&gt;

}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, supporters of DPS argue that banning parties on the basis of their ethnic composition constitutes an instance of ethnic discrimination and is in contravention to European law, the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] in particular to which Bulgaria is a signatory. Furthermore, despite a similar constitutional ban, religious parties, such as the [[Bulgarian Christian Coalition]] have competed for parliamentary elections since 1997, and again in 2005, without any political upheaval.

More recently, Antonina Zheliazkova, head of the Centre for Interethnic Relations in Sofia, praised Ahmed Dogan by stating that "He has been working hard to open up the party to all citizens and has encouraged the DPS's supporters to be free to vote for non-ethnic parties".&lt;ref name='novinite'&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Turkish political factions===
At present there are three other tiny Turkish political factions that oppose the DPS’s politics. These groups&amp;nbsp;— which united to form the Balkan Democratic League&amp;nbsp;— are the Movement of the Democratic Wing (DDK), led by Osman Oktay; the Party for Democracy and Justice (PDS), led by Nedim Gencev; and the Union of the Bulgarian Turks (SBT), led by Seyhan Türkkan.&lt;ref name='novinite'/&gt;

However, these movements, as well as the National Movement for Rights and Freedoms, member of a Social-Democratic coalition ('Rose coalition') failed to secure any elected representative in the parliament.  A party founded in 2011 by members who left the party and headed by [[Korman Ismailov]]&amp;mdash;[[People's Party Freedom and Dignity]], gained 1.5% of the vote in a coalition with [[National Movement for Stability and Progress|National Movement Simeon II]] (NDSV) and therefore did not cross the 4% threshold to enter the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://results.cik.bg/pi2013/rezultati/index.html|title=Резултати :: Избори за народни представители 2013|website=results.cik.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; This party was part of the [[Reformist Bloc]] and crossed the threshold and entered the parliament and the government in 2014, but only with one Deputy Minister that was removed. Another political fraction [[Democrats for Responsibility, Solidarity and Tolerance|DOST]] founded by the former leader Mestan, had 17,000 registered members in 2016, which were obtained only for about one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trafficnews.bg/news.php?id=57373|title=Лютви Местан в Пловдив: Ще подкрепим кандидат за президент-ярък натовец|website=Traffic News}}&lt;/ref&gt; If so, the members of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms must have dropped in numbers.

===Alleged manipulation of votes===

The DPS was severely criticized by the Bulgarian ultra-nationalist party Attack as well as mainstream right-wing political parties such as [[Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria]] (DSB) and the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (SDS) and even by DPS coalition partners of the [[National Movement for Stability and Progress|National Movement Simeon II]] for allegedly manipulating the vote in the June 2005 elections in some places by bringing Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin living in Turkey to vote in the elections.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} However, allegations of ethnic Turks coming to vote in Bulgaria at their permanent address and then returning to Turkey to vote with their passports, could not be "verified or confirmed" by international observers, whose assessment on the election was that it was free and fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/documents/odihr/2005/11/16836_en.pdf|title=Page not found - OSCE|website=www.osce.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liberal party opposing privatization===
In February 2005, the DPS opposed the privatisation of Bulgaria's largest tobacco company, Bulgartabac, which was backed by the government and the European Union, on the grounds that the industry traditionally employs ethnic Turks. The resulting crisis led to the resignation of vice premier Lidia Shuleva.&lt;ref name='novinite'/&gt;

=== Delyan Peevski ===
{{Main|Delyan Peevski}}
Delyan Peevski Is "a highly controversial figure in Bulgarian politics, business and media." He has served several terms of office in Bulgaria's Parliament as a DPS MP. He even served as head of the Bulgarian FBI equivalent (the State Agency for National Security) for one day, "but after mass protests broke out in the streets was forced to hand in his resignation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bnr.bg/en/post/100673145/smoke-billowing-from-delyan-peevskis-business-empire|title=Smoke billowing from Delyan Peevski’s business empire|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, he had served as a member of Parliament in three National Assemblies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bnt.bg/en/a/mp-delyan-peevski-withdraws-from-doing-any-future-business-in-bulgaria|title=MP DELYAN PEEVSKI WITHDRAWS FROM DOING ANY FUTURE BUSINESS IN BULGARIA|last=|first=|date=|website=BNT News|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has a number of stakes in businesses, particularly in the media. According to Bulgarian National Television, "In 2015, he officially acquired shares in Balkan Media Group, which includes the newspapers “Telegraph”, “Minitor”, “Politika”, "Meridian Match” and others. He has shares in Technomarket and in a factory for cigarette packaging. He declared he had stakes in 4 foreign companies. He was a minority shareholder in Bulgartabak, from where he withdrew at the beginning of 2016."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In April 2017, 240 MPs were sworn in at the opening session of Bulgaria's 44th National Assembly. Peevski was among them, serving a fourth term, although, as ''Balkan Insight'' reported, "his nomination as chief of the national security service in 2013 sparked Bulgaria’s largest street protests in nearly a decade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/newcomers-dominate-bulgaria-s-new-parliament-04-19-2017-1|title=Newcomers Dominate Bulgaria’s New Parliament :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Served as head of State Agency for National Security for one day ====
[[Plamen Oresharski]] announced in June 2013 that "controversial figure and MRF MP Delyan Peevski was being nominated to head the State Agency for National Security."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sofiaglobe.com/2016/10/20/bulgaria-presidential-elections-movement-for-rights-and-freedoms-officially-endorses-oresharski/|title=Bulgaria presidential elections: Movement for Rights and Freedoms officially endorses Oresharski|date=2016-10-20|website=The Sofia Globe|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulgarian Parliament voted to make him the head of the agency. "This almost brought down the then two-week old government of Prime Minister Plamen Oresharski, who leads a minority coalition between the Socialists and the DPS. The situation also embarrassed Sergei Stanishev, the leader of the Bulgaria Socialist Party (BSP), who is also leader of the Party of European Socialists (PES)."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standartnews.com/english/read/bulgarian_symbol_of_the_shady_power_brokerage_withdraws_from_european_parliament-3767.html|title=Bulgarian ''symbol of the shady power brokerage'' withdraws from European Parliament|last=|first=|date=|work=Standart News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peevski said that he didn't understand why he was being blamed for trying to take the helm of the agency. He complained that Bulgaria's law enforcement institutions were "submerged by false signals" against him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the ''Sophia Globe'', "The widely supported public protests unleashed by that move and the May 2014 thrashing of the BSP ( Movement for Rights and Freedoms) in European Parliament elections ultimately led to the government having to resign."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

His appointment "sparked the largest protests since the fall of communism, with tens of thousands of citizens heading to the streets."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/eu-elections/123851|title=Bulgarians protest controversial MEP listing|access-date=2017-06-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the constitutional court reinstated Peevski as an MP. This led to thousands of students to occupy [[Sofia University]], the largest university in Bulgaria. The occupation temporarily shut down the university.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Abruptly announced stopping doing business ====
On March 21, 2016, Peevski announced that he would withdraw from doing any business projects in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He said that the reason was undue political pressure and the "ongoing media campaign against him." He blamed the media campaign for having a negative effect on the companies that he owned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In early March 2016, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov suspended public procurement procedures. He gave, as one of his reasons, that there was public opinion that companies allegedly linked to Peevski were involved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Viewed as symbol of corruption in Bulgaria politics ====
Peevski likes to call himself "a young and successful man" in Bulgaria. However, most of Bulgaria's society views Peevski as the symbol of corruption in politics. According to ''Balkan Insight'' in 2016, "Over 15 years, Delyan Peevski, who is still only 35, has scaled the dizzy heights of Bulgarian politics and business life."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bulgaria-turns-on-its-golden-boy-peevski-02-17-2016|title=Bulgaria Turns on its Golden Boy, Peevski :: Balkan Insight|website=www.balkaninsight.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, he came "under unprecedented attack. His very future in politics now looks in doubt."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

“Peevski has become the personification of the mafia-oligarchic way in which Bulgaria is governed,” Ognyan Minchev, director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies, said.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to ''Standart'', "Peevski is considered a symbol of the shady power brokerage that has impoverished Bulgarians, and ruined the country's reputation. Officially, Peevski has no property, but it is widely assumed that he controls vast economic interests, and a powerful media group, which is waging a dirty war against his political opponents."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Uses business empire to back the party in power ====
Freedom House reported, "Corruption is a serious concern in Bulgaria. Both the EU interventions and the KTB collapse in 2014 were seen as consequences of illicit collusion among the political and economic elite. Peevski’s New Bulgarian Media Group (NBMG) consistently supports the party in power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/2015/bulgaria|title=Bulgaria {{!}} Country report {{!}} Freedom in the World {{!}} 2015|website=freedomhouse.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2016 book ''The Kremlin Playbook: Understanding Russian Influence in Central and Eastern Europe'', Peevski "controls a business empire spanning at least five economic sectors including media and telecommunications, energy, construction, tobacco, and defense, making him one of the most powerful individuals in the country."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Kremlin Playbook: Understanding Russian Influence in Central and Eastern Europe|last=Conley|first=Heather A.|last2=Mina|first2=James|last3=Stefanov|first3=Russian|last4=Vladimirov|first4=Martin|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2016|isbn=|location=|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2014 election: Protests, winning, and abruptly abandoning his seat ====
According to ''EUObserver'' in April 2014, "The recent appointment of controversial media mogul Delyan Peevski to head the candidates' list in three areas for the Turkish party Movements for Rights and Freedoms has triggered new protests in Sofia."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/eu-elections/123851|title=Bulgarians protest controversial MEP listing|last=Popkostadinova|first=Nikoleta|date=2014-04-15|work=EUObserver|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DPS defended its nomination, saying Peevski was nominated because he has a good reputation and is a successful businessman who could help the country get [[European Union]] funds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Sociologist Andrey Raichev of [[Gallup International Association|Gallup International]] said Peevski's candidacy was more about removing him from the national political scene and "rewarding him as he is close to the previous political leader of the party, Ahmed Dogan, one of the most influential and powerful politicians in the country."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

''EUObserver'' wrote, "Bulgarians were outraged that Peevski, who along with his mother Irena Krasteva, manages a growing media empire that backs whichever government is in power, is set to be elected to the European Parliament in next month's [2014] vote."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since the protests in June 2013, he has not once been seen at the Bulgarian Parliament.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[Bulgarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] supported his candidacy, believing that it would mobilize voters to go to the polls, resulting in a higher turnout and thus "thwarting Peevski’s shot at the EU parliament, which would also draw a line under the political unrest that marked 2013." Many believe that if Peevski were to be elected to the EU parliament, he would continue to manage his businesses from Brussels rather than doing a good job in the parliament position.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

"Much to the relief of the European liberal family", Peevski abruptly announced on election night that he would not take up his seat in Bulgaria's Parliament, despite being elected. He ceded his seat to Iskra Mihailova, then-minister of ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.standartnews.com/english/read/bulgarian_symbol_of_the_shady_power_brokerage_withdraws_from_european_parliament-3767.html%2027|title=Стандарт - Новини, които си струва да споделим|last=|first=|date=|work=Стандарт - Новини, които си струва да споделим|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=Bulgarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington'''" is the second episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 3)|third season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on September 26, 1991. In the episode, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] enters in an essay contest to write an essay about America's greatness. When she wins it, she and the family travel to [[Washington, D.C.]] where the finals are to be held. Lisa is dismayed after witnessing a bribery scandal in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]]. In her final essay, she disdains and condemns the [[Federal government of the United States|government system]], which leads to the arrest of the corrupt [[United States Congress|congressman]] who accepted the bribe. While Lisa fails to win the contest, her faith in government is restored.

The episode was written by [[George Meyer]] and directed by [[Wes Archer]], and it was the first episode for which [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] served as [[show runner]]s. It features multiple references to the 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', including the scene in which Lisa appeals to Lincoln's statue at the [[Lincoln Memorial]] for advice. Other Washington landmarks referenced in the episode include the [[Jefferson Memorial]], the [[Watergate Hotel]], the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]], the [[White House]], the [[National Air and Space Museum]], and the [[Washington Monument]].

The episode acquired a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 12.9, and was the third highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired. It received mostly positive reviews from television critics, who praised the episode for its satire on American politics. However, the [[timber industry]] criticized the scene in which Lisa witnesses a timber industry lobbyist offering a bribe to the congressman in order to demolish the Springfield Forest. The scene was described as "an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is to have been born in a timber town."&lt;ref name="Durbin"/&gt;

==Plot==
[[Homer Simpson|Homer]] takes an interest in the ''Reading Digest'' magazine after a copy is sent to the [[Simpson family]]'s residence. In the magazine, he notices an advertisement for a children's contest in which an essay must be written about what makes America great. [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] chooses to enter, takes a trip to Springfield Forest, and is inspired to write her essay when she sees the forest's natural beauty and when an eagle lands right by the branch she is sitting under. Lisa's article is approved for entry in the national finals in Washington, D.C. after the contest judge observes Homer's poor vocabulary and realizes that he could not have written Lisa's essay for her.

While Homer and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] enjoy the all-expenses-paid perks of their trip, Lisa visits famous monuments for inspiration. At one particular monument, she overhears a corrupt congressman, Bob Arnold, taking a bribe from a representative of the logging industry to demolish Springfield Forest. Heartbroken and disillusioned by the dishonesty of government officials, Lisa tears up her essay and writes a more painful yet truthful essay to show the patriotic judges. The new essay, entitled "Cesspool on the Potomac", disdains and condemns the government system of corruption and greed, and mentions the names of those involved in the bribery. Lisa's essay causes a ruckus and elicits a hostile reaction from the judges and audience. Messages are quickly sent around the capital regarding Lisa's speech and Arnold is expelled from his job, arrested and sent to prison. Lisa's essay does not win because of its content, but with the news of the congressman's arrest and his having become a born-again Christian while in prison, her faith in government is restored, while the contest winner commends Lisa for her courage and honesty. The episode ends with Bart slingshotting the annoying pianist that performed at the contest and he tells Lisa that she was the one who inspired him to stand up for what he believes in.

The episode was written by [[George Meyer]]. It is one of ''The Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]'s favorite episodes of the earlier seasons because he thought it took the show to another level.&lt;ref name="Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer said he has a "deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general," which affected the way he wrote the episode.&lt;ref name="Believer"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.believermag.com/issues/200409/?read=interview_meyer |title=George Meyer |accessdate=2009-07-30 |work=[[The Believer (magazine)|The Believer]] |date=September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], who had written for ''The Simpsons'' since the start of the show, took over as [[show runner]]s for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" and they felt a lot of pressure about running the show. Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier.&lt;ref name="Jean"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean said "one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough',"&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt; and Reiss added that "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this."&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;{{cite video |people=Reiss, Mike |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wes Archer]] directed "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington", which was one of the first episodes to feature the Simpson family traveling to a real-life location.&lt;ref name="Archer"&gt;{{cite video |people=Archer, Wes |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because much of the episode takes place outside of Springfield, new background and character designs had to be animated. The Simpson family visits several real-life landmarks in Washington, which the animators were able to draw with the help of photographs from the animation studio's library. ''The Simpsons'' director [[David Silverman (animator)|David Silverman]] grew up in the Washington area so he was able to help out with the designs.&lt;ref name="Silverman"&gt;{{cite video |people=Silverman, David |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marge Simpson|Marge]]'s voice actor, [[Julie Kavner]], said she loved the charm of the family "just being on a trip and experiencing the hotel room they're staying at, and the integrity of Bart's character. You know, you just want to kill him for doing all those tricks and pranks."&lt;ref name="Kavner"&gt;{{cite video |people=Kavner, Julie |date=2003 |title=The Simpsons season 3 DVD commentary for the episode "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jean believes this is one of the secrets of the show's success, the fact that it is about a family and the writers can use experiences from their own or their family's life as an inspiration in their writing. He thought "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" was a perfectly constructed episode in that sense.&lt;ref name="Jean"/&gt;

The title and plot of the episode is a parody of the 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'',&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt; in which the character Jefferson Smith comes to Washington with patriotic enthusiasm, but is instead shocked to see evidence of corruption in the government.&lt;ref name="Keith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Booker |first=Keith |title=Drawn to Television - Prime-time Animation from the Flintstones to Family Guy |chapter=Animation's New Age: Meet The Simpsons |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=2006 |page=61 |isbn=978-0-313-07615-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bam |last=Bray |first=Nick |date=January 27, 2001 |work=[[The Courier Mail]] |page=M02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Tampa Tribune]]''{{'}}s Curtis Ross called this reference one of the best film references in ''The Simpsons''{{'}} history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘The Simpsons’ Goes To The Movies |last=Ross |first=Curtis |date=July 27, 2007 |work=[[The Tampa Tribune]] |page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lisa's visit to the [[Lincoln Memorial]] is a direct reference to ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'', in which Smith appeals to [[Abraham Lincoln (1920 statue)|Lincoln's statue]] for inspiration like Lisa did in the episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kaufman, Will |title=The Civil War in American Culture |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-7486-1935-6 |page=56 |chapter=Abe Lincoln's Mixed Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era'', Barry Schwartz writes that the scene with Lisa at the crowded monument shows how "thoroughly Lincoln's moral and emotional significance has waned."&lt;ref name="Schwartz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Schwartz |first=Barry |title=Abraham Lincoln in the Post-Heroic Era: History and Memory in Late Twentieth-Century America |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=2009 |page=156 |chapter=Erosion |isbn=978-0-226-74188-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Reinhart writes in the book ''Abraham Lincoln on Screen'' that the scene sums up "with brilliant wit" the American society's "annoying and ultimately useless tendency to ask [themselves] 'What would Lincoln have done?' whenever [they] face a political or social dilemma."&lt;ref name="Reinhart"/&gt; ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'' was once again referenced on ''The Simpsons'' in the [[The Simpsons (season 14)|season fourteen]] episode "[[Mr. Spritz Goes to Washington]]".&lt;ref name="Keith"/&gt;

The episode makes references to several real-life persons.

==Themes and analysis==
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|Lisa's role in the episode has been compared to [[Henry David Thoreau]].]]
"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" has been labeled as a satire on American politics. Michael Bitzer, in an edited book by Joseph Foy and Stanley Schultz entitled ''Homer Simpson Goes to Washington'', said this episode "espouses the virtues, vices, and varieties of American political culture, public opinion, and ultimately the [[American Dream]]."&lt;ref name="Foy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Foy |first=Joseph |author2=Schultz, Stanley |title=Homer Simpson Goes to Washington |publisher=[[University Press of Kentucky]] |year=2008 |page=42 |chapter=Popular Culture and Public Opinion |isbn=978-0-8131-2512-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bitzer also wrote that ''The Simpsons'', through "skillful" use of satire, demonstrates with this episode "insights into the underlying political culture and public opinion of the United States' governing system (and, more broadly, society at large)."&lt;ref name="Foy"/&gt; In his book ''Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization'', Paul Arthur Cantor said he was amazed by how far the episode "willing to take its corrosive satire of national politics."&lt;ref name="Cantor"/&gt; He said it "attacks the federal government at its foundation, the patriotic myths upon which its legitimacy lies. It makes fun of the very process by which patriotism is inculcated in the nation's youth, the hokey contests that lead children to outdo each other in progovernment effusions."&lt;ref name="Cantor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Cantor |first=Paul |title=Gilligan Unbound: Pop Culture in the Age of Globalization |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2003 |page=89 |isbn=0-7425-0779-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the corrupt congressman is arrested, Lisa proclaims "The system works!" Benedict Anderson wrote in the book ''The Spectre of Comparisons'' that series creator Matt Groening "assumes that his tickled audience is confident that the system barely works [...] So why does he need to show a patriot at all, especially one who is a deluded little female block-head? Probably because he, too, wishes to be seen as giving America another chance. Mr. Lisa guarantees his good intentions."&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Benedict |title=The Spectre of Comparisons: Nationalism, Southeast Asia, and the World |publisher=[[Verso Books]] |year=1998 |page=365 |chapter=The Goodness of Nations |isbn=978-1-85984-184-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Günter Beck, a lecturer for the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) at the Haifa Center for German and European Studies at the [[University of Haifa]] in Israel, compared Lisa's role in the episode to the nineteenth-century American poet and philosopher [[Henry David Thoreau]]. He writes that Lisa stands up against the public's indifference towards the political system that Thoreau criticized, and comments that the emphasis should be "on the brave moral decision to stand up for principles and against the broad public. By this courageous act, 'to do what is right', an individual could save the well-being of the whole community. And indeed, Lisa’s bravery is the impulse for the state’s representatives to carry out their democratic obligations, so she can gladly notice 'The system works!' — her trust in democracy and its institutions is restored. Thoreau on the other hand, had no lasting trust in the system but only in the people themselves and in the individual’s capacity to realize development and democracy."&lt;ref name="Beck"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beck |first=Günter |year=2008 |title="Mmm...

==Reception==

===Broadcast and re-releases===
"Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on September 26, 1991.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Groening |first=Matt |authorlink=Matt Groening |editor1-first=Ray |editor1-last=Richmond |editor1-link=Ray Richmond |editor2-first=Antonia |editor2-last=Coffman |title=[[The Simpsons episode guides#The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family|The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite Family]]  |edition=1st |year=1997 |location=New York |publisher=[[HarperPerennial]] |lccn=98141857 |ol=433519M |oclc=37796735 |isbn=978-0-06-095252-5 |page=63 |ref={{harvid|Richmond &amp; Coffman|1997}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The episode finished 36th in the ratings for the week of September 23–29, 1991, with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 12.9, equivalent to approximately 11.9 million viewing households.

===Critical reviews===
Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It was named the third best episode of ''The Simpsons'' by Sarah Culp of ''The Quindecim'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.www.thequindecim.com/media/storage/paper618/news/2003/02/19/ArtsAndEntertainment/The-Simpsons.Top.25.Episodes-372979.shtml |title=The Simpsons' Top 25 Episodes |last=Culp |first=Sarah |date=February 19, 2003 |work=The Quindecim |accessdate=2009-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219032151/http://media.www.thequindecim.com/media/storage/paper618/news/2003/02/19/ArtsAndEntertainment/The-Simpsons.Top.25.Episodes-372979.shtml |archivedate=February 19, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the ten best episodes by Jim Schembri of ''[[The Age]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=What a difference a D'oh! makes |last=Schembri |first=Jim |date=July 26, 2007 |work=[[The Age]] |page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, praised the episode for being one of the best Lisa-centric episodes, and called Lisa's talk with [[Thomas Jefferson]] and her nightmare vision of politicians as pigs "especially worthy of note."&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season3/page3.shtml |title=Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington |accessdate=2009-05-26 |author1=Martyn, Warren |author2=Wood, Adrian |year=2000 |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 4.5 rating and said it is one of the best episodes featuring Lisa, "complete with poignant observations about politics."&lt;ref name="Meyers"/&gt; He particularly enjoyed the appearance of Barbara Bush at the White House.&lt;ref name="Meyers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=6129 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season |last=Meyers |first=Nate |date=June 23, 2004 |publisher=Digitally Obsessed |accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Steven Stein said this was the first episode of ''The Simpsons'' he saw. Even though he did not understand half of the pop culture references, by the end of the episode he was a "''Simpsons'' convert."&lt;ref name="Stein"/&gt; He thought there was "something exotic about an issue as serious as political corruption being dealt with in a cartoon and being interrupted by jokes about beer and, yes, doughnuts."&lt;ref name="Stein"&gt;{{cite news |title=Springfield on big screen? That's okely-dokely by me |last=Stein |first=Steven |date=July 27, 2007 |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |page=A16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was praised for its political satire. Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict called the episode a "biting political satire in the guise of a children's oratory contest", that "signifies that this season of the series will be all over the map, both emotionally and logically."&lt;ref name="Gibron"/&gt; Gibron added: "Everything, from the ''Reader's Digest'' rants to the formulaic speeches of the youths, has a resounding ring of truth. And once the story moves to Washington D.C, our nation's capital is in for a royal reaming as well."&lt;ref name="Gibron"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-05-26 |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason3.php |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=2005-02-23 |author=Gibron, Bill |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629194944/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/simpsonsseason3.php |archivedate=2009-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend said the episode solidified the series' politically satirical voice as it "bitch slapped the Bush administration" that [[History of The Simpsons#Feud with George H. W. Bush|would later badmouth ''The Simpsons'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/review.php?id=545 |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Third Season - DVD |last=Wilson |first=Bryce |date=June 18, 2004 |publisher=Cinema Blend |accessdate=2009-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson, however, gave the episode a more negative review, stating that it "has its moments but never seems like one of the series’ better programs. Part of that stems from its somewhat icky ending. The show exhibits a tone that feels more appropriate to a less biting and cynical series. It starts well with Homer’s obsession with ''Reading Digest''. After that, the show seems more erratic, and it remains pretty average overall."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2009-05-26 |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonthree.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete Fifth Season (1993) |publisher=DVD Movie Guide |date=2004-12-21 |author=Jacobson, Colin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from the timber industry===
According to ''[[The Plain Dealer]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Rodney Ferguson, the [[timber industry]] was insulted by the scene in which a timber industry lobbyist offers a bribe to the corrupt congressman so that he can demolish Springfield Forest. The Oregon Lands Coalition, a pro-timber group in [[Salem, Oregon]], "bombarded" the producers of the show with phone calls and mail protesting the episode.&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; The coalition said it portrayed loggers unfairly and is "allowing itself to be used by environmental extremists."&lt;ref name="Durbin"&gt;{{cite news |title=Loggers Get Bad Vibes From Lisa |last=Durbin |first=Kathie |date=October 15, 1991 |work=[[The Oregonian]] |page=D01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an open letter to ''The Simpsons'' executive producer [[James L. Brooks]], the coalition wrote: "Rather than approach this issue with genuine concern for Mother Earth, you took an easy shot at hard-working people whose only crime is to have been born in a timber town."&lt;ref name="Durbin"/&gt; Karen Clark, a payroll clerk for a timber company in [[Stayton, Oregon]], said: "''The Simpsons'' portrayed us as greedy, bribery-type people. It didn't portray us as the everyday people—mothers, fathers, good members of society—that we are."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Luke Popovich, vice president of the American Forest Council, wrote a letter to the show's producer to protest "the fuzzy-headed characterizations that pass for political correctness, the thinking in Hollywood where people are not very serious about these issues, but interested in pushing the right hot buttons, scoring the right points with audiences."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"&gt;{{cite news |title=Opus, Doonesbury and Friends Ruffle Some Feathers |last=Ferguson |first=Rodney |date=February 2, 1992 |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |page=16A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Matt Groening by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Matt Groening]], creator of ''The Simpsons'', responded to the criticism of the episode. |alt=A man in glasses and a plaid shirt sits in front of a microphone.]]''The Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening responded to the criticism in an interview with ''[[TV Guide]]'', in which he said he did "research on the ecological damage caused by clear-cutting and over-logging [and] it's really appalling."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Jackie Lang, a timber industry activist in Salem who helped lead the protest against the Fox network and Groening, said she was appalled by Groening's response, and "he will be sorry he ever made it."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; Jake Hogan, supervising producer of the show, defended Groening: "[The episodes] are just little stories, little comedies—stories that make people laugh."&lt;ref name="Ferguson"/&gt; On October 15, 1991, Groening issued another statement the public, in which he said: "So now a few lumber companies have joined the nuclear power industry, right-wing preachers and high-ranking Republicans in attacking ''The Simpsons''. We must be doing something right. I must point out ''The Simpsons'' is a cartoon show—not ''[[60 Minutes]]''. Later in the show, the same lobbyist proposed drilling for oil in [[Teddy Roosevelt]]'s head at Mount Rushmore. Please don't tell the oil companies about this."&lt;ref name="Reinhard"&gt;{{cite news |title=I've Got A 'Brooklyn Bridge' To Sell You |last=Reinhard |first=David |date=October 25, 1991 |work=[[The Oregonian]] |page=C08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Reinhard of ''[[The Oregonian]]'' commented on the criticism: "Hollywood sharpsters can always make a group from the great American hinterland look ridiculous when it zeroes in on one show, particularly if that show is a cartoon. And the Oregon Lands Coalition's protest was a bit of an overreaction. But the environmental sloganeering of ''The Simpsons'' as well as Groening's cartoon commentary are symptomatic of a Hollywood and a popular culture that are hostile to the concerns and values of most Americans."&lt;ref name="Reinhard"/&gt; After the episode aired, media researchers Robert Lichter and Linda S. Lichter found in a study of prime-time television that when shows dealt with business themes, 89 percent portrayed businessmen as swindlers or liars.&lt;ref name="Reinhard"/&gt;

The same day Groening released his second statement, ''The Simpsons'' publicist Antonia Coffman was invited by Wayne Giesy, sales manager of Hull-Oakes Lumber Co. in [[Bellfountain, Oregon]], to visit Oregon and see "responsible timber management."&lt;ref name="Durbin"/&gt; Giesy said they wanted to show the producers "how we log, how we manufacture, what goods we produce for everyone and how we replant for future generations. What most timber companies are interested in is a balanced program."&lt;ref name="Durbin"/&gt;

The '''Palm Olein Import Scam''' ('''Palm Olein Case''', '''Palm Olein Corruption Case''', 1991–92) refers to the alleged irregularities in the import of [[palm oil|palm olein]] by the [[K. Karunakaran]]-led [[United Democratic Front (India)|United Democratic Front]] government of the [[Kerala|state of Kerala]], India through the Power and Energy Limited Company.&lt;ref name="frontlineonnet.com"&gt;[http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl2818/stories/20110909281803600.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The Kerala government selected Power and Energy Limited arbitrarily without inviting tenders, allegedly at an inflated price and at an excessive service charge and in violation of central and state government procedure.&lt;ref name="frontlineonnet.com"/&gt;

The Palmolein import scam was first brought to light officially by a report of the Accountant-General of Kerala in July 1993, a Comptroller and Auditor General report in February 1994, and subsequently by a report of the Public Undertakings Committee of the Kerala Legislative Assembly in March 1996. After a Left government came to power in May 1996, a vigilance case was registered against Karunakaran and six others on 21 March 1997. Following an inquiry, a charge sheet was submitted to the Court of the Inquiry Commissioner and Special Judge, Trivandrum, on 23 March 2001. The case dragged on, with Karunakaran filing writ petitions and appeals before the Kerala High Court and the Supreme Court of India, raising the plea of bad faiths (mala fides) and eventually obtaining a stay order from the [[Supreme Court of India]] in August 2007. The appeal remained pending before the Supreme Court of India until Karunakaran's death in December 2010.&lt;ref name="frontlineonnet.com"/&gt;

==Case==
The government of Kerala decided to import 15,000 tonnes of palm oil from Power and Energy Ltd, a [[Malaysia]]n company in [[Singapore]], at a price higher than on the open market. The price of import was fixed to USD405 per tonne, while the international market price was USD392.25 per tonne. The import order was signed by [[P. J. Thomas, Polayil|P. J. Thomas]], who was then Kerala's Food Secretary. The investigation agency's charge sheet says that this order caused a loss of more than 2.32 [[crore]]s to the public finances.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The opposition cried foul in the import. A vigilance case was filed against K. Karunakaran and seven others, including Thomas.A Special Leave Petition by Karunakaran made the Supreme Court of India stay the proceedings against him. The court closed the proceedings entirely against Karunakaran after his death in December 2010. Thomas was bailed in 2003. {{cn|date=August 2017}}

The case was reopened in March 2011.&lt;ref name="caseopen"&gt;[http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-03-15/news/28691418_1_palmolein-import-ramesh-chennithala-finance-minister Palmolein import scandal case to be reopened] The Economic Times,Thiruvananthapuram, 15 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2011, [[Oommen Chandy]], as the then Finance Minister in Karunakaran's Cabinet and the Chief Minister of Kerala, was also added to the new investigation. The court asked the vigilance and anti-corruption bureau to submit its investigation report by 10 November 2011.&lt;ref name="palmaugust"&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1110809/jsp/nation/story_14356796.jsp Palm oil deal glare on Chandy] The Telegraph,Thiruvananthapuram, 8 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Chandy was the 23rd witness in the case and had been well known as the leader of the inner-party campaign launched by the [[A. K. Antony]] group within the State Congress against Karunakaran, especially on the palmolein issue during the early 1990s, when the import deal first became a controversy.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

===Accused===
* K. Karunakaran
* Former Food and Civil Supplies Minister [[T .H. Musthafa]], a close associate of Karunakaran
* Former Chief Secretary [[S. Padmakumar]] (who, along with Karunakaran, allegedly met the Singapore-based company representative in New Delhi and agreed informally on the deal as early as October 1991)
* Former Additional Chief Secretary, [[Zacharia Mathew]]
* Former Managing Director of the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation, [[Jiji Thomson]]
* Director of Mala Export Corporation, [[V. Sadasivan]]
* Director of P&amp;E Pvt. Ltd, Sivaramakrishnan
* P. J. Thomas

==Expulsion of Chief Vigilance Commissioner==
A debate raged against Thomas heading the position as CVC and being accused in the case. On 3 February 2011, he was finally asked to quit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SC tells CVC Thomas to quit|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/SC-tells-CVC-Thomas-to-quit/H1-Article1-668849.aspx|accessdate=2011-03-04|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/cvc-loses-job-upa-face/757596/|title=CVC loses job, UPA face - Indian Express|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the Supreme Court on the grounds that he had a corruption case pending against him.

==Exoneration of Chandy==
On 25 June 2013, the Kerala High Court exonerated Chandy. The verdict was in response to a petition, filed by CPI-M veteran [[V. S. Achuthanandan]] and former bureaucrat and legislator K.J. Alphonse, contesting a vigilance probe clean chit to Chandy in the 1999 case. The court dismissed a petition filed by CPI-M veteran V.S. Achuthanandan and former bureaucrat and legislator K.J. Alphonse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/oommen-chandy-gets-clean-chit-in-palm-oil-import-scam/1/285258.html|title=CM Oommen Chandy gets clean chit in palm oil import scam|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 February 2016, the Supreme Court rejected Achuthanandan's plea and said that he was just dragging the case to get political mileage.  The judges said "It seems you (Achuthanandan) want to keep the matter pending to score points against each other. Are you trying to fish in troubled waters? We will not allow this gameplan to continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Politics/Dwq9lFggLvlRRPBmVGd3xL/SC-rejects-Achuthanandans-plea-in-palmolein-import-scam-cas.html|title=SC rejects Achuthanandan’s plea in palmolein import scam case|first=|last=PTI|date=16 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Patriotic hacking''' is a term for [[Hacker (computer security)|computer hacking]] or [[system cracking]] in which citizens or supporters of a country, traditionally industrialized Western countries but increasingly developing countries, attempt to perpetrate attacks on, or block attacks by, perceived [[enemy of the state|enemies of the state]]. Recent media attention has focused on efforts related to terrorists and their own attempts to conduct an online or electronic [[intifada]] - [[cyberterrorism]]. Patriot hacking is illegal in countries such as the [[United States]] yet is on the rise elsewhere. "The FBI said that recent experience showed that an increase in international tension was mirrored in the online world with a rise in cyber activity such as web defacements and denial of service attacks," according to the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2760899.stm|title=US hackers told to leave Iraq alone|date=14 February 2003|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2016|via=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===War in Iraq - 2003===
At the onset of the [[War in Iraq]] in 2003, the FBI was concerned about the increase in hack attacks as the intensity of the conflict grew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/security/18821779;jsessionid=4S4XBIGILOXITQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN|title=http://www.crn.com/security/18821779;jsessionid=4S4XBIGILOXITQE1GHPCKHWATMY32JVN|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, it has been becoming increasingly popular in the [[North America]], [[Western Europe]] and [[Israel]].{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} These are the countries which have the greatest threat to [[Islamic terrorism]] and its aforementioned digital version.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Summer Olympics - 2008===
Around the time of the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay]], which was marred by [[2008 Tibetan unrest|unrest in Tibet]], Chinese hackers claim to have hacked the websites of [[CNN]] (accused of selective reporting on the [[2008 Lhasa riots]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anti-cnn.com |title=Anti-CNN website |publisher=Anti-cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2009-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409202554/http://www.anti-cnn.com/ |archivedate=2008-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Carrefour]] (a French shopping chain, allegedly supporting Tibetan independence),&lt;ref&gt;SBS Dateline, 6 Aug 2008 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-swdOEI5V5g] video link&lt;/ref&gt;  while websites and forums gave tutorials on how to launch a [[DDoS]] attack specifically on the CNN website.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

===Op Vijaya by Indian hackers – 2015===
Indian hackers in 2015 took down thousands of Pakistani websites including pakistan.gov.pk and Right To Information Pakistan under the attack named as #OPvijaya under the leadership of In73ct0r d3vil. This attack is considered to be a patriotic move by Indian hackers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6440">The '''Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement''', abbreviated as '''PRRM''', is a [[non-governmental organization]] and institution formed in 1952 in order to assist the poor members of society in the [[Philippines]].  As a movement, it was initiated by upper and middle class group of individuals based on the experiences gained from the rural reconstruction and development done in [[China]] during the beginning of the 1900s.  After [[World War II]], among its tasks had been the establishment of [[cooperative]]s in rural communities.  It was the inspiration of the founding of the Federation of Free Farmers in 1953, as well as the birthing of organizations similar to PRRM in other countries such as [[Thailand]], [[Colombia]], [[India]], and [[Guatemala]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwcc.wisc.edu/info/abroad/sibal.html ''Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM)''], ''NGO-initiated Coops'', uwcc.wisc.edu&lt;/ref&gt;  Its main office is currently based in [[Quezon City]].,&lt;ref name=UNCCD/&gt;&lt;ref name="LTQ"&gt;[http://library.thinkquest.org/25009/solutions/solutions.prrm.html ''Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement''], The Beggar's Hand, library.thinkquest.org&lt;/ref&gt; which became possible through Dr. Yen's establishment of another related organization during the 1960s, namely the [[International Institute of Rural Reconstruction]] (IIRR).&lt;ref name=PRRM&gt;[http://prrm.org/aboutus.htm ''Beginnings''], Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement, prrm.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==
In the 1900s, the Philippine [[Rural Reconstruction Movement]] was founded and inspired by its then leader Dr. [[Y.C. James "Jimmy" Yen]] (also known as [[Yan Yangchu]]&lt;ref name="PRRM" /&gt;), a national of China.  It was brought the Philippines, specifically in [[Nueva Ecija]] and then also in [[Rizal province]],&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;Flavier, Juan M. ''[[Doctor to the Barrios]]'', pages 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; by Filipinos such as [[Conrado Benitez]], a person connected to the [[University of the Philippines]], with the vision to empowering and developing rural communities and the aim of providing training on self-government and on how such communities can [[sustainability|sustain]] itself globally, nationally, and locally.&lt;ref name="LTQ" /&gt;

Apart from Conrado Benitez, original members of PRRM's [[Board of Trustees]] also included [[Salvador Araneta]], [[Cornelio Balmaceda]], [[Cecilio Putong]], [[Juan Salcedo, Jr.]], [[Asuncion A. Perez]], [[Gil Puyat]], [[Paul R. Parrette]], and [[Albino Z. Sycip]].  Apart from Benitez, Sycip, Putong and Salcedo, Jr., PRRM's original [[Incorporation (business)|incorporator]]s also included [[Esteban E. Abada]], [[Eulogio Rodriguez, Jr.]], [[Roland Renne]], [[Juan Cojuangco]], [[Oscar B. Arellano]], and [[Jose S. Camus]].&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt;

In 1970, former [[Department of Health (Philippines)|Philippine Secretary of Health]] and [[Philippine Senate|Senator]] Dr. [[Juan Flavier]], conveyed his experiences while working with and for PRRM by writing his book entitled ''[[Doctor to the Barrios]]''.&lt;ref name="Am"&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0027JZIW2 ''DOCTOR TO THE BARRIOS Experiences with the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement''], amazon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, PRRM became a partner of the Ayala Foundation USA, with the task of building potable water facilities within chosen Philippine [[barangay]]s.&lt;ref name="AFUSA"&gt;[http://www.af-usa.org/news.asp?id=171 ''The Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement: AF-USA’s First Partner for the Year 2009!''], Ayala Foundation USA, af-usa.org, January 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==
Among its present-day roles is the promotion of [[sustainable agriculture]], technologies in the fishing business and farming, [[agroforestry]], planning and implementation of managing resources in communities,&lt;ref name=UNCCD/&gt; the fight against ignorance through education, the fight against proverty through livelihood training, the fight against diseases through health education, improvement in access to justice, restoration of cohesion and connection among and between communities, creation of livelihood, environmental stewardship, awareness of public policies,&lt;ref name="LTQ"/&gt; and the dissemination of information to other Philippine and Asian non-governmental organizations.&lt;ref name=UNCCD&gt;[http://www.unccd.int/ngo/accreditationDB/institutionDetails.php?id=467 ''Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement (PRRM)''], unccd.int&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future Goals ==
A core objective of the Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement is to build up the Conrado Benitez Institute for Sustainability (CBIS), which functions as the educational, research and technical troubleshooting wing of the PRRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future Goals|url=http://www.prrm.org/anniversary/next50.html|work=PRRM: The Next 50 Years|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By focusing on education for sustainability through providing educational courses which cover topics such as sustainable local economy, agriculture, coastal resource management, new and renewable energy, and gender issues, CBIS aims to inculcate sustainability into the future generation.

In addition, the PRRM intends to advocate issues related to environment and sustainable development, economic development, social development and the rights of women, children and youth, and governance and citizen’s participation.

Other long-term goals also include: the creation of an organization information database and the implementation of a “report card” system. The former acts as the basis for monitoring the ongoing projects and operations and the aim is to boost the efficiency of the different operations by at least 25%.&lt;ref name="xa.yimg.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Philippine Rural Reconstruction Movement Service Learning Paper|journal=Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health’s Report of the Strategic Management of PRRM|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/22135515/50716633/name/FINAL+STRAMA+PAPER.doc|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While for the latter allows progress and accomplishments of ongoing projects to be recorded and reported. The PRRM aims to achieve workflow streamlining, publication exposure and quality, improved staff training and management accountability.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4778">{{Redirect|RICA||Rica (disambiguation)}}
The '''Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act''' (RICA) is a [[South Africa]]n [[law]] that regulates the interception of communications and associated processes such as applications for and authorisation of interception of communications. The law came into effect on 22 January 2003 when it was published in the [[Government Gazette of South Africa]] number 28075.  

==Scope==
RICA regulates the interception of communications, the monitoring of radio signals and radio frequency spectrums and the provision of communication-related information &amp;ndash; information relating to indirect communication in the records of [[telecommunication]] service providers. 
It also regulates applications for interception of communications and provision of communication-related information under certain circumstances. It regulates law enforcement where interception of communications  is involved and prohibits the provision of telecommunication services which do not have the capability to be intercepted and requires telecommunication service providers to store communication-related information (CRI). The law specifies costs to be borne by telecommunication service providers related to these requirements and compensation to services providers. It provides for the establishment of interception centres an Office for Interception Centres and an Internet Service Providers Assistance Fund. Lastly it prohibits the manufacturing, assembling, possessing, selling, purchasing or advertising of interception equipment without a certificate of exemption issued by the relevant Minister.

==Structure==
RICA is not limited to the provisions contained in the Act itself, but is supplemented by a directive, a notice, a schedule and four proclamations. The directive prescribed the technical and security requirements related to the interception and routing of communications and the recordal and storage of CRI. Schedule A of the Directive applies to fixed line telecommunications operators and Schedule B and C applies to mobile cellular providers and Internet service providers respectively. The various types of listed equipment is detailed in the notice while the Schedule lists serious crimes that justify interception. Finally the four proclamations deal with the enforcement dates of the Act. Since its promulgation RICA has been amended four times. Two of these amendments are already in force and two are pending. 

==Constitutional Conflict==
{{Original research|date=May 2012}}

Section 14 of the Bill of Rights in the South African Constitution of 1996 expressly provide that "everyone has a right to privacy, which includes the right not to have (...) (d) the privacy of their communications infringed". The rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited, section 36 of the Constitution. However, various other provisions in the Bill of Rights indirectly imply a right to safety and security. If citizens have a right to security, it creates a corresponding duty on the State. Chapter 11 of the Constitution governs this duty and authorise the Police, Defence Force and Intelligence Agencies to assist the State in its security obligations. Parliament therefore attempted to balance these two conflicting rights by providing for judicial oversight and limiting interception only to those cases where a serious crime is involved.

==Duties and Prohibitions==
RICA provides for three main types of provisions - duties, prohibitions and procedures. The duties are directed at enabling interception, while the prohibitions are aimed at enforcing the individuals privacy right. 

==Equality==
It is, however, neither privacy nor security that raise the most objections against RICA, but equality concerns. A recent proposed amendment to section 40 provides for preferential treatment of mobile providers by extending the enforcement of cell phone registration indefinitely.

==Technological neutrality==
Different communications tools and technologies are also not subject to equal treatment in RICA. An email, for example is not subject to the onerous duty that related data (like the time, date, sender and recipient of the email) s

'''Right to Rise''' is a [[political action committee]] (PAC) created to support [[Jeb Bush]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]]. A [[Super PAC]], Right to Rise is permitted to raise and spend unlimited amounts of corporate, union, and individual [[campaign contributions]] under the terms of the [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|''Citizens United'']] Supreme Court decision.&lt;ref name=isen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Isenstadt|first1=Alex|title=Jeb Bush's $100M May|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/05/jeb-bush-right-to-rise-super-pac-campaign-117753|accessdate=16 October 2015|publisher=Politico|date=8 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The creation of the Super PAC was announced on January 6, 2015 by Bush.&lt;ref name=grier/&gt; According to Bush, the name was inspired by Congressman [[Paul Ryan]] and 1996 Republican vice presidential candidate [[Jack Kemp]].&lt;ref name=grier&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grier|first1=Peter|title=Jeb Bush launches 'Right to Rise' PAC. What does name mean?

Bush officially announced his candidacy in June 2015, at which point [[Mike Murphy (political consultant)|Mike Murphy]] took over leadership of Right to Rise.&lt;ref name=jordan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Mary|title=Mike Murphy plots a win for Jeb Bush in the land of Hollywood liberals|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jeb-bushs-man-in-hollywood/2015/06/12/febca268-0584-11e5-a428-c984eb077d4e_story.html|accessdate=16 October 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bush campaign planned to leave Right to Rise in charge of television and digital advertising efforts, while the Bush campaign would take charge of voter outreach.&lt;ref name=isen/&gt; 

Through July 2015, Bush's campaign and Super PAC had raised over $114 million, which gave "Bush a sizable financial advantage over more than a dozen GOP rivals and over Democratic front-runner [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]]". Bush rewarded top donors by inviting them to a donor retreat in [[Kennebunkport]], hosted at his [[George H. W.

In spring of 2015, donors were concerned "that focusing so much on filling the super PAC’s coffers might leave the campaign cash-poor"; yet the Bush campaign initially built "out a massive campaign with ballot-access teams working every state and senior staffers earning more than $200,000 annual salaries" and "hired scores of policy aides". Once Danny Diaz became the Bush campaign manager in June 2015, "he went on a cost-cutting spree — implementing painful across-the-board cuts that affected staffers at nearly every corner of the campaign".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/02/jeb-bush-dropping-out-set-up-to-fail-213662#ixzz40mOUaaHu]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "tens of millions of dollars in ad buys" from Right to Rise failed to raise Bush's standing in polls, while Trump managed to generate tremendous free media exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jeb Bush's 2016 departure draws out Mike Murphy critics|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/21/politics/mike-murphy-jeb-bush-drops-out-right-to-rise/index.html|website = CNN|date=February 22, 2016|author=Reston, Maeve|access-date = 2016-02-22|quote=Right to Rise also angered some of its own donors by targeting Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who could well become the Republican Party's nominee.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven of 16 major donors were also unhappy with Right to Rise's spending on the Bush campaign, including "stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members-only, jacket-and-tie clubs and fundraisers at the Four Seasons, the St. Regis and the Mandarin Oriental", private planes, and "big spending on staff". By contrast rival [[Ted Cruz]] resorted to cheaper options like [[Holiday Inn]] and [[budget airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-bush-insight-idUSKCN0V6194]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2015, Mike Murphy explained his strategy: "If other campaigns wish that we’re going to uncork money on Donald Trump, they’ll be disappointed....Trump is, frankly, other people’s problem".&lt;ref&gt;Costa, Robert and Rucker, Philip.  [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-gop-fields-new-strategies-to-ride-out-the-trump-tornado/2015/08/20/0f0c9628-4761-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html "Inside the GOP field’s new strategies to ride out the Trump tornado"], [[Washington Post]] (August 20, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Later in 2015, Murphy further explained that the PAC's strategy was based on the assumption that Trump's campaign would inevitably fail, and so the PAC would instead concentrate on defeating other GOP candidates, "candidates in our lane that we can overcome."&lt;ref&gt;Issenberg, Sasha.  [https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/features/2015-10-20/mike-murphy-of-right-to-rise-explains-his-theory-that-jeb-bush-is-still-the-candidate-to-beat "Mike Murphy of Right to Rise Explains His Theory That Jeb Bush Is Still the Candidate to Beat"], [[Bloomberg News]] (October 20, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Murphy's decision to target GOP establishment candidates [[Marco Rubio]] and Ohio Governor [[John Kasich]], instead of [[Donald Trump]], created dissatisfaction among some major donors to the PAC. Kasich's strategist was quoted as saying "Their super PAC ran a tough campaign, they ran a lot of negative ads. We had to disavow some of the things that our super PAC ran, so I'm sure that Jeb Bush -- I wouldn't speak for him, clearly -- might do things differently if he was in control of his super PAC. I have no idea." In addition, the Super PAC's "decision to emphasize Bush's government experience in a year when voters clearly were looking for outsider cred and a candidate who could channel anger at the establishment" was seen as a wrong strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jeb Bush's 2016 departure draws out Mike Murphy critics|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/21/politics/mike-murphy-jeb-bush-drops-out-right-to-rise/index.html|website = CNN|date=February 22, 2016|author=Reston, Maeve|access-date = 2016-02-22|quote=Right to Rise also angered some of its own donors by targeting Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who could well become the Republican Party's nominee.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen F. Hayes]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' offered this assessment of Right to Rise in January 2016:&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, Stephen.  [http://www.weeklystandard.com/how-jeb-cleared-the-way-for-trump/article/2000726 "How Jeb Cleared the Way for Trump"], [[The Weekly Standard]] (January 23, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Trump has had few better allies than Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Bush's candidacy. There will be plenty of blame to go around if Trump ends up as the Republican nominee, but Right to Rise will have earned a prominent chapter in those histories....Right to Rise, like an all-pro right guard, helped clear a path for Trump by blocking several of his would-be tacklers, in particular Marco Rubio. This was no accident. It was the plan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Defeat===
Bush ultimately suspended his run on February 20, 2016, shortly after the [[United States presidential election in South Carolina, 2016|South Carolina primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Jeb Bush Bows Out of Campaign, Humbled and Outgunned|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/21/us/politics/jeb-bush.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2016-02-20|access-date = 2016-02-21|issn = 0362-4331|first = Ashley|last = Parker|first2 = Michael|last2 = Barbaro}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jeb Bush Drops Out of Presidential Race|url = http://time.com/4231664/jeb-bush-drops-out-president/|website = TIME.com|access-date = 2016-02-21|first = TIME|last = Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was Murphy's second time that he had managed an expensive campaign loss. Murphy's first failure was [[Meg Whitman]]'s $177 million campaign where she was defeated in the [[2010 California gubernatorial election]] by Democrat [[Jerry Brown]] who spent $36 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jeb Bush's 2016 departure draws out Mike Murphy critics|url = http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/21/politics/mike-murphy-jeb-bush-drops-out-right-to-rise/index.html|website = CNN|date=February 22, 2016|author=Reston, Maeve|access-date = 2016-02-22|quote=Right to Rise also angered some of its own donors by targeting Florida Sen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2790">The '''Royal Commission on the National Health Service''' was set up by the [[Labour Government 1974–79|Wilson government]] in 1975. It was to consider the "best use and management of the financial and manpower resources of the NHS".

The [[Royal Commission]] reported in June 1979, by which time the government had changed.  It recommended, among other things, that the administration of the Health Service should be simplified by eliminating, in most cases, a tier of management, a recommendation which appealed to [[Patrick Jenkin]] the new Secretary of State.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (MERRISON REPORT)|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1979/jul/18/national-health-service-merrison-report|accessdate=16 May 2015|publisher=Hansard|date=18 July 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of district health authorities in England and Wales|Area Health Authorities]] were abolished in 1982.

The idea that responsibility for the delivery of health services should be transferred from the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] to the [[Regional health authority (UK)|Regional Health Authorities]] was less welcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheard|first1=Sally|title=Doctors in Whitehall: medical advisers at the 60th anniversary of the NHS|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/doctors-in-whitehall-medical-advisers-at-the-60th-anniversary-of-the-nhs|website=History and Policy|accessdate=16 May 2015|date=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''rural community councils ("RCCs")''' were established in rural [[England]] during the twentieth century to promote [[rural]] community life.

Each shire county now has one, although some are relative newcomers.  The RCCs also form a national coalition called [[Action with Communities in Rural England]] ("ACRE").

Each RCC is an independent, locally managed organisation but is dependent on external funding for its continued work.  Historically, RCCs were primarily funded by the [[Rural Development Commission]], but this role was subsequently taken over by the [[Countryside Agency]].  Most RCCs are also funded through project work linked to their aims and objectives, and from work undertaken for their closely related county-wide organisations representing [[Parish councils in England|parish councils]] and playing field committees.

[[Community council]]s in [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] are different and exist on a [[statutory]] basis.

The '''''Scepter of Judah''''' ({{lang-he|'''Shebet Yehuda'''|script=Latn}} {{Hebrew|שבט יהודה}}) was a text produced by the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] [[historian]] [[Solomon Ibn Verga]]. It first appeared in [[Turkey]] in 1553.

The work was essentially a comprehensive analysis of sixty-four different [[persecution]]s that the [[Jewish]] people had suffered since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Hardly an insular text, it made use of [[Latin]] sources as well. It also had a certain [[anthropological]] value, as Ibn Verga discussed the [[customs]] and practices of Jews in various lands. Ibn Verga also sought to highlight what he felt were the faults of his people, and as such, much of his [[criticism]]s of the Jews are exaggerated for effect.

In many ways the ''Scepter of Judah'' was the first and most significant work of Jewish [[historiography]]; it was essentially the first time that such a comprehensive interest had been expressed by the Jews in their past. Ibn Verga sought to clarify the problem of anti-Jewish sentiment, which had manifested itself in the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] in 1492. According to the author, the expulsion from Spain and Jewish exile in general were natural phenomena that were subject to historical forces of causation and explanation. They were not simply "punishment" for the [[sins]] of the Jewish people, as had been the time-honored way of explaining such misfortunes.

The text posited the view that the [[Anti-Semitism|hatred of the Jews]] is a popular inheritance which is passed from [[generation]] to generation. It is occasioned by [[religious fanaticism]] (as had been the case in Spain) and is compounded by [[envy]] and [[jealousy]]; it also stems from a lack of [[education]]. Ibn Verga also suggested that there was perhaps too much flaunting of opulence amongst the [[Sephardim]]; certain festivities had been too extravagant, which had raised antagonism and jealousy amongst [[Catholics]].  Whether this was actually the case is debatable.

The ''Scepter of Judah'' was one of the most popular Jewish history books of all time, perhaps the most popular until the 19th century.

{{Unreferenced|date=August 2010}} '''Sentralanlegget''' (English translation: Central Facility) is the war headquarters of the [[Norwegian government]]. The facility is located in [[Hole, Norway|Hole]] municipality in [[Buskerud]] County, and designed as an [[underground shelter]] in the west side of the mountain Kongens utsikt. The purpose of this is to avoid a direct hit from a [[nuclear missile]] from the east.

==History==
Sentralanlegget was built by the [[civil defense]] authority during the 60s.
[[The cold war]] and the threats represented by the [[Soviet Union]] made it necessary to build a facility where members of the [[Norwegian Royal Family]], members of the government and other key personnel could evacuate to in case of a military attack on the nation. Hole municipality was chosen due to its massive mountain range, ideal for an underground shelter, and because of its relative proximity to the governmental offices and the Royal Palace in [[Oslo]]. The end of the Cold war marked a change in the threats against Norway, as the neighboring Soviet Union no longer existed. Seen in the light of the modern world, this facility is now in many terms outdated. Nevertheless, it is still operative and can be used if the situation should prove it necessary. During the 80s the Norwegian government built a new, smaller and more modern war headquarter in a bunker under the governmental offices in Oslo. This, though, can not accommodate a larger number of persons for a longer time.

==Function==
Sentralanlegget has two main entrances located some three hundred meters apart. From these, tunnels lead to the facility inside the mountain. 
The facility can accommodate 600 persons for months, and includes a hospital, restaurant/bar, communication central, conference rooms, situation room, private rooms for members of the government and the royal family and storage rooms for supplies. The facility is self-contained with power, water, air and food. It is the [[Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning]] that is responsible for the daily operation of Sentralanlegget. The Ministry of Justice and the Police and the Prime Ministers Office are also involved.

==Secrecy==

Due to the sensitive nature of such a facility, location and technical details are classified. The entrances are digitally removed from aerial photos in Norwegian internet search engines. During the 80s, journalists in a newspaper for a leftist non-violence organisation were threatened with legal action by the Prime Ministers Office if they published a story on the facility. In April 2010, the [[Norwegian broadcasting corporation|Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] reported that phone numbers, address, and the number of employees could be found in Norwegian search engines and [[Telephone directory|telephone book]]s. All information was provided by the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning, most likely caused by a human error. Journalists also found technical drawings and lists of security cleared personnel lying open for everyone in the Norwegian state archive. These were later withdrawn.

'''''Singulari Nos''''' (subtitled ''On The Errors Of Lammenais'') was an [[encyclical]] issued on June 25, 1834 by [[Pope Gregory XVI]]. Essentially a follow-up to the better-known ''[[Mirari Vos]]'' of 1832, ''Singulari Nos'' focused strongly on the views of French priest [[Hughes Felicité Robert de Lamennais]], who did not see any contradiction between [[Catholicism]] and then-modern ideals of [[liberalism]] and the [[separation of Church and State]].

==Background==
In October 1830 Lamennais, [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire]], and [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert]] founded the newspaper, ''L'Avenir'', which advocated an enlarged suffrage, [[separation of church and state]], universal [[Freedom of thought|freedom of conscience]], instruction, [[Freedom of assembly|assembly]], and [[Freedom of the press|the press]], views were opposed by the French bishops. Despite being warned by [[Hyacinthe-Louis de Quélen|Archbishop Quelen]] of Paris that their expectations were unrealistic, they sought support from Pope Gregory XVI.&lt;ref name=owen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xtbLJZOKxx8C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=Singulari+Nos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-NiMTwLNwx&amp;sig=LFTMJ0M5z-1cTIdbK7NME2T7whg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwihvtST-aHJAhXL1B4KHe4BBxQ4ChDoAQhLMAk#v=onepage&amp;q=Singulari%20Nos&amp;f=false Chadwick, Owen. "Gregory XVI", ''A History of the Popes, 1830-1914'', Oxford University Press, 2003] {{ISBN|9780199262861}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although pressured by the French government and the French hierarchy, [[Pope Gregory XVI]] would have preferred not to make an official issue of the matter.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;[https://www.ohio.edu/chastain/ip/lamann.htm Bernard, Cook. "Lamennais, Hugues-Felicité Robert de (1782-1854)", ''Encyclopedia of 1848 Revolutions'', (James Chastain, ed.), Ohio University, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Newman]] described the situation in Rome at that time:&lt;blockquote&gt;The French Revolution in July, 1830, had been followed in no long time by insurrection within the papal territories; Austria intervened to reduce the revolting cities; and France took possession of Ancona to keep Austria in check. These events placed the Sovereign Pontiff between two opposite dangers; his fears from France are intelligible enough; Austria, on the other hand, had always been supposed to covet the portion of the pontifical states on the north of the Apennines; and the suspicion had been so strong in Rome, in 1821, that the government had not allowed the Austrian forces to pass through the city on their way to Naples. Whilst then the Pope was in this unpleasant dilemma, Russia, according to M. de la Mennais, stepped in and offered her aid. She alleged that she could not possibly have any interested views as regards the Italian peninsula, either revolutionary or ambitious, and she offered to place a force at the Pope's disposal to defend him against all emergencies. In return she did but ask, that the Pope would take the part of the Autocrat against Poland, and instruct the Polish Roman bishops accordingly. The offer was accepted on the specified condition.&lt;ref name=newman&gt;[http://www.newmanreader.org/works/essays/volume1/mennais/fall.html Newman, John Henry. "Fall of de la Mennais", ''British Critic'', October 1837]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Newman noted, "Nothing can be more discordant, less capable of a common measure, than a question of abstract religious truth, and a question of practice and matter of fact, in relation to the measures to be pursued by one secular power towards another; as discordant was the position of the Pope with that of the conductors of the Avenir."&lt;ref name=newman/&gt; Circulation of Lamannais's later account (1837) of his trip to Rome, ''Affaires de Rome'', was prohibited in Prussia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CvMaAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=Lamennais+%2B+Words+of+a+Believer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiMobLm-qbJAhWFWD4KHSZyAr44ChDoAQg1MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=Lamennais%20%2B%20Words%20of%20a%20Believer&amp;f=false "Abbé de la Mennais", ''The New-York Review'', Vol. 2, (Lambert Lilly, Coleb Sprague Henry, Joseph Green Cogswell, eds.), George Dearborn &amp; Co., 1838]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1832 Gregory issued the encyclical ''Mirari vos''. General in scope, it upheld clerical celibacy, and raised concerns over too close alliances between the clergy and government. It denounced those who advocated divorce,{{sfn|Mirari vos, §12}} and secret societies that sought overturn the legitimate governments of the Italian states&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16mirar.htmPope Gregory XVI, ''Mirari vos'', Rome, August 15, 1832]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also denounced the views of Lemannais without specifically naming him. The encyclical satisfied neither Lamennais's supporters nor detractors.&lt;ref name=owen/&gt;

==''Paroles d'un croyant''==
[[Image:Hugues Felicité Robert de Lamennais.PNG|thumb|Hugues-Felicité Robert de Lamennais (1826)]]
While Lemannais agreed to submit to the Pope in matters of faith and morals, he noticeably did not retract any of his political views. Although he ceased publication of ''L'Avenir'', Lamennais continued to be attacked by French conservatives. In 1834 he responded with a short, biting book, ''Paroles d'un croyant'' (Words of a Believer), in which he denounced all authority, civil as well as ecclesiastical. The book was a sensation. [[Franz Liszt]] dedicated the piano piece "Lyon" (S156 1) to Lamennais.&lt;ref name=Merrick&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KhY9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=Lamennais+%2B+Words+of+a+Believer&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mWiS_RkqJ_&amp;sig=QS_FW-RdhiH1MQ49WNNwcse3Eaw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiR29-Q86bJAhWL1B4KHUWtAzsQ6AEIMzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Lamennais%20%20%20Words%20of%20a%20Believer&amp;f=false Merrick, Paul.

==Encyclical==
In early April 1834 when the French government attempted to suppress trade union activities, silk-weavers in Lyon rose in revolt. The government responded by arresting republican sympathizers in Paris and sending the army to put down the rising.&lt;ref name=Merrick/&gt;

The experience of the popes during the recent revolutions, being expelled from Rome, widespread unrest in the Papal States and temporal power to anti-Catholic forces, and the erosion of even spiritual allegiance, predisposed the reaction of the Papacy.&lt;ref&gt;Schultenover, S.J., David G., ''A View from Rome: On the Eve of the Modernist Crisis'', New York: Fordham University Press, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Gregory issued Singulari Nos on June 25. "We have learned of the pamphlet written in French under the title Paroles d'un croyant, for it has been printed by this man and disseminated everywhere. ... Though small in size, it is enormous in wickedness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Greg16/g16singu.htm Pope Gregory XVI, ''Singulari Nos'', §2, June 25, 1834]&lt;/ref&gt; ... Once the torch of treason is ignited everywhere, it ruins public order, fosters contempt of government, and stimulates lawlessness."{{sfn|Singulari Nos, §4}}&lt;blockquote&gt;We have studied the book entitled Paroles d'un croyant. By Our apostolic power, We condemn the book: ... It corrupts the people by a wicked abuse of the word of God, to dissolve the bonds of all public order and to weaken all authority. It arouses, fosters, and strengthens seditions, riots, and rebellions in the empires. We condemn the book because it contains false, calumnious, and rash propositions which lead to anarchy; which are contrary to the word of God; which are impious, scandalous, and erroneous; and which the Church already condemned...{{sfn|Singulari Nos, §6}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The encyclical ends with plea for the author to recognize his errors.

==Effects==
Lamennais's brother [[Jean-Marie de Lamennais|Jean-Marie]], by that time Superior General of the [[Mission Priests of the Immaculate Conception]], repudiated ''Paroles'' and the two never met again.&lt;ref name=Harrison&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v1rMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=Singulari+Nos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZAjKXjpnS2&amp;sig=xwChCq2H9ii4YcmcZEgYzpoyfOM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjagIq9qKfJAhUMHT4KHbxIBNYQ6AEIPDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Singulari%20Nos&amp;f=false Harrison, Carol E., ''Romantic Catholics: France’s Postrevolutionary Generation in Search of a Modern Faith'', Cornell University Press, 2014] {{ISBN|9780801470592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Paroles'' and Gregory's response effectively allowed no middle ground between the two positions. Few of Lamennais's associates were willing to follow him out of the Church.&lt;ref name=Harrison/&gt;

J.P.T. Bury finds it ironic that the most lasting effect of Lamennais's polemics was a strengthening of [[Ultramontanism]]. He notes that [[Prosper Guéranger|Dom Prosper Guéranger]], who was an early Lemannais follower, became the principal agent of a liturgical revival and a uniform Roman Liturgy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jRQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=Singulari+Nos&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9E3GnUD2Nt&amp;sig=P70-GO7vDHLTNNb5DGcI8YTbA0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0l-HKrKfJAhVEXD4KHZxYCOY4FBDoAQgiMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Singulari%20Nos&amp;f=false Bury, J.P.T., "Religion and Relations of Churches and States", ''The New Cambridge Modern History'', Vol. 10, CUP Archive, 1960] {{ISBN|9780521045483}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire|Lacordaire]] was instrumental in reestablishing the Dominican Order in France.

[[Islamic economics in the world|Trading]] played an important role in the spread of [[Islam]] in several parts of the world, notably [[Islam in Indonesia|southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Gibbon, ci, ed.

== Conversions ==

The expansion of the [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] in the first centuries after [[Muhammad]]'s death soon established Muslim dynasties in [[North Africa]], [[West Africa]], to the [[Middle East]], and [[Somalia]].

===Phase I: Early Caliphs and Umayyads (610–750 CE)===
{{see also|Muslim conquests|Rashidun Caliphate|Umayyad Caliphate}}

Within the century of the establishment of Islam upon the [[Arabian peninsula]] and the subsequent rapid expansion of the Arab Empire during the [[Muslim conquests]], one of the most significant empires in world history was formed.&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;Goddard, pg.126-131&lt;/ref&gt; For the subjects of this new empire, formerly subjects of the greatly reduced [[Byzantine]], and obliterated [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] Empires, not much changed in practice. The objective of the conquests was mostly of a practical nature, as fertile land and water were scarce in the Arabian peninsula. A real Islamization therefore only came about in the subsequent centuries.&lt;ref name="Hourani 1"&gt;Hourani, pg.22-24&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ira Lapidus]] distinguishes between two separate strands of converts of the time: one is animists and polytheists of tribal societies of the Arabian peninsula and the [[Fertile crescent]]; the other one is the native Christians and Jews who existed peacefully before the Muslim invaders arrived.&lt;ref name="Lapidus 4"&gt;Lapidus, 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam in Somalia|Islam was introduced]] in [[Somalia]] in the 7th century when the Muslim Arabs fled from the persecution of the Pagan [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]] tribe. When the Muslims defeated the Pagans, some returned to [[Arabia]], but many decided to stay there and established Muslim communities along the Somali coastline. The local [[Somalis]] adopted the Islamic faith well before the faith even took root in its place of origin.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+so0014)|title=A Country Study: Somalia from The Library of Congress|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the polytheistic and pagan societies, apart from the religious and spiritual reasons each individual may have had, conversion to Islam "represented the response of a tribal, pastoral population to the need for a larger framework for political and economic integration, a more stable state, and a more imaginative and encompassing moral vision to cope with the problems of a tumultuous society."&lt;ref name="Lapidus 4"/&gt; In contrast, for sedentary and often already monotheistic societies, "Islam was substituted for a Byzantine or Sassanian political identity and for a Christian, Jewish or Zoroastrian religious affiliation."&lt;ref name="Lapidus 4"/&gt; Conversion initially was neither required nor necessarily wished for: "(The Arab conquerors) did not require the conversion as much as the subordination of non-Muslim peoples. At the outset, they were hostile to conversions because new Muslims diluted the economic and status advantages of the Arabs."&lt;ref name="Lapidus 4"/&gt;

Only in subsequent centuries, with the development of the religious doctrine of Islam and with that the understanding of the Muslim [[ummah]], did mass conversion take place. The new understanding by the religious and political leadership in many cases led to a weakening or breakdown of the social and religious structures of parallel religious communities such as Christians and Jews.&lt;ref name="Lapidus 4"/&gt;

The caliphs of the Arab dynasty established the first schools inside the empire which taught Arabic language and Islamic studies. They furthermore began the ambitious project of building mosques across the empire, many of which remain today as the most magnificent mosques in the Islamic world, such as the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus. At the end of the Umayyad period, less than 10% of the people in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Tunisia and Spain were Muslim. Only on the Arabian peninsula was the proportion of Muslims among the population higher than this.&lt;ref name="Hourani 2"&gt;Hourani, pg.41-48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase II: The Abbasids (750–1258)===
{{see also|Abbasid Caliphate}}
[[File:Mustansiriya University CPT.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s are known to have founded some of the world's earliest educational institutions such as the [[House of Wisdom]].]]

Expansion ceased and the central disciplines of Islamic [[islamic philosophy|philosophy]], [[Islamic theology|theology]], [[Islamic Law|law]] and [[Islamic mysticism|mysticism]] became more widespread and the gradual conversions of the populations within the empire occurred. Significant conversions also occurred beyond the extents of the empire such as that of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic tribes]] in [[Central Asia]] and peoples living in regions south of the [[Sahara]] in [[Africa]] through contact with Muslim traders active in the area and [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]]. In Africa it spread along three routes, across the Sahara via trading towns such as [[Timbuktu]], up the [[Nile Valley]] through [[the Sudan]] up to [[Uganda]] and across the [[Red Sea]] and down [[East Africa]] through settlements such as [[Mombasa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. These initial conversions were of a flexible nature.

The reasons why, by the end of the 10th century, a large part of the population had converted to Islam are diverse. According to British-Lebanese historian [[Albert Hourani]], one of the reasons may be that
&lt;blockquote&gt;  	 
"Islam had become more clearly defined, and the line between Muslims and non-Muslims more sharply drawn. Muslims now lived within an elaborated system of ritual, doctrine and law clearly different from those of non-Muslims. (...) The status of Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians was more precisely defined, and in some ways it was inferior. They were regarded as the 'People of the Book', those who possessed a revealed scripture, or 'People of the Covenant', with whom compacts of protection had been made. In general they were not forced to convert, but they suffered from restrictions. They paid a special tax; they were not supposed to wear certain colors; they could not marry Muslim women;."&lt;ref name="Hourani 2"/&gt;	 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be pointed out that most of these laws were elaborations of basic laws concerning non-Muslims (''[[dhimmi]]s'') in the [[Quran]]. The Quran does not give much detail about the right conduct with non-Muslims, in principle recognizing the religion of "People of the book" (Jews, Christians, and sometimes others as well) and securing a separate tax from them inlieu of the [[zakat]] imposed upon Muslim subjects.

[[Ira M. Lapidus|Ira Lapidus]] points towards "interwoven terms of political and economic benefits and of a sophisticated culture and religion" as appealing to the masses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Lapidus, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that :

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The question of why people convert to Islam has always generated intense feeling. Earlier generations of European scholars believed that conversions to Islam were made at the point of the sword, and that conquered peoples were given the choice of conversion or death. It is now apparent that conversion by force, while not unknown in Muslim countries, was, in fact, rare. Muslim conquerors ordinarily wished to dominate rather than convert, and most conversions to Islam were voluntary. (...) In most cases worldly and spiritual motives for conversion blended together. Moreover, conversion to Islam did not necessarily imply a complete turning from an old to a totally new life. While it entailed the acceptance of new religious beliefs and membership in a new religious community, most converts retained a deep attachment to the cultures and communities from which they came."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The result of this, he points out, can be seen in the diversity of Muslim societies today, with varying manifestations and practices of Islam.

Conversion to Islam also came about as a result of the breakdown of historically religiously organized societies: with the weakening of many churches, for example, and the favoring of Islam and the migration of substantial Muslim Turkish populations into the areas of Anatolia and the Balkans, the "social and cultural relevance of Islam" were enhanced and a large number of peoples were converted. This worked better in some areas (Anatolia) and less in others (e.g. the Balkans, where "the spread of Islam was limited by the vitality of the Christian churches.")&lt;ref name="Lapidus 4"/&gt;

Along with the religion of Islam, the Arabic language, number system and Arab customs spread throughout the empire. A sense of unity grew among many though not all provinces, gradually forming the consciousness of a broadly Arab-Islamic population: something which was recognizably an Islamic world had emerged by the end of the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Hourani 11"&gt;Hourani, pg.54&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout this period, as well as in the following centuries, divisions occurred between Persians and Arabs, and Sunnis and Shiites, and unrest in provinces empowered local rulers at times.&lt;ref name="Hourani 2"/&gt;

====Conversion within the Empire: Umayyad Period vs. Abbasid Period====
There are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as responsible for setting up the "dhimmah"  to increase taxes from the ''[[dhimmi]]s'' to benefit the Arab Muslim community financially and to discourage conversion.&lt;ref name="Astren"&gt;Fred Astren pg.33-35&lt;/ref&gt; Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arabs and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of ''[[mawali]]''.&lt;ref name="Astren"/&gt; Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues from the tax on non-Muslims.

During the following [[Abbasid]] period an enfranchisement was experienced by the ''mawali'' and a shift was made in the political conception from that of a primarily Arab empire to one of a Muslim empire&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;Tobin 113-115&lt;/ref&gt; and c. 930 a law was enacted that required all bureaucrats of the empire to be Muslims.&lt;ref name="Astren"/&gt; Both periods were also marked by significant migrations of Arab tribes outwards from the [[Arabian Peninsula]] into the new territories.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt;

====Conversion within the Empire: "Conversion curve"====
[[Richard Bulliet]]'s "conversion curve" shows a relatively low rate of conversion of non-Arab subjects during the Arab centric [[Umayyad]] period of 10%, in contrast with estimates for the more politically multicultural [[Abbasid]] period which saw the Muslim population grow from approx. 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt; This theory does not explain the continuing existence of large minorities of Christians in the Abbasid Period. Other estimates suggest that Muslims were not a majority in Egypt until the mid-10th century and in the Fertile Crescent until 1100. Syria may have had a Christian majority within its modern borders until the Mongol Invasions of the 13th century.

===Phase III: Dissolution of the Abbasids and the emergence of the Seljuks and Ottomans (950-1450)===
The expansion of Islam continued in the wake of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] conquests of [[Asia Minor]], the [[Balkans]], and the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt; The earlier period also saw the acceleration in the rate of conversions in the Muslim heartland while in the wake of the conquests the newly conquered regions retained significant non-Muslim populations in contrast to the regions where the boundaries of the Muslim world contracted, such as [[Sicily]] and [[Al Andalus]], where Muslim populations were expelled or forced to [[Christianization|Christianize]] in short order.&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt; The latter period of this phase was marked by the [[Mongol invasion]] (particularly the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)|siege of Baghdad]] in 1258) and after an initial period of persecution, the conversion of these conquerors to Islam.

===Phase IV: Ottoman Empire: 1299 - 1924===
{{see also|Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Central europe 1683.png|thumb|200px|Territories in Central Europe under the [[Ottoman Empire]], 1683 CE.]]
The [[Ottoman Empire]] defended its frontiers initially against threats from several sides: the [[Safavids]] on the Eastern side, the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the North which vanished with the [[Conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, and the great Catholic powers from the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and Venice with its eastern Mediterranean colonies.

Later, the Ottoman Empire set on to conquer territories from these rivals: Cyprus and other Greek islands (except Crete) were lost by Venice to the Ottomans, and the latter conquered territory up to the Danube basin as far as Hungary. Crete was conquered during the 17th century, but the Ottomans lost Hungary to the Holy Roman Empire, and other parts of Eastern Europe, ending with the [[Treaty of Carlowitz]] in 1699.&lt;ref name="Hourani 5"&gt;Hourani, pg.221,222&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase V: Post-Ottoman Empire to the present===

Islam has continued to spread through commerce and migrations; especially in [[Southeast Asia]], [[Americas|America]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Goddard"/&gt;

Like their Byzantine and late Sasanian predecessors, the [[Marwanid]] caliphs nominally ruled the various religious communities but allowed the communities' own appointed or elected officials to administer most internal affairs. Yet the Marwanids also depended heavily on the help of non-Arab administrative personnel and on administrative practices (e.g., a set of government bureaus). As the conquests slowed and the isolation of the fighters (''muqatilah'') became less necessary, it became more and more difficult to keep Arabs garrisoned. As the tribal links that had so dominated Umayyad politics began to break down, the meaningfulness of tying non-Arab converts to Arab tribes as clients was diluted; moreover, the number of non-Muslims who wished to join the ummah was already becoming too large for this process to work effectively.

The Great Muslim army siege Jerusalem, held by the Byzantine Romans, in November, 636 CE. For four months, the siege continued. Ultimately, the [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]], an ethnic Arab,&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Wagner. ''Dying in the Land of Promise: Palestine and Palestinian Christianity from Pentecost to 2000''&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to surrender Jerusalem to [[caliph Omar]] in person. The caliph, then at Medina, agreed to these terms and travelled to [[Jerusalem]] to sign the capitulation in the spring of 637. Sophronius also negotiated a pact with Omar, known as the Umariyya Covenant or [[Umar's Assurance|Covenant of Omar]], allowing for religious freedom for Christians in exchange for "[[jizya]]", a tax to be paid by conquered non-Muslims, called "[[dhimmis]]". Under Muslim Rule, the Christian and Jewish population of Jerusalem in this period enjoyed the usual tolerance given to non-Muslim theists.&lt;ref name="Catholic Jerusalem"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm |year=1910 |title=Jerusalem}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Jew in the Medieval World: A Source Book, 315-1791 |last=Marcus |first=Jacob Rader |publisher=Hebrew Union College Press |date=March 2000 |isbn=0-87820-217-X |pages=13–15 |edition=Revised }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having accepted the surrender, Omar then entered Jerusalem with Sophronius "and courteously discoursed with the patriarch concerning its religious antiquities".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Gibbon|Gibbon]], ci, ed. Bury, London, 1898, V, 436&lt;/ref&gt; When the hour for his prayer came, Omar was in the Anastasis church, but refused to pray there, lest in the future Muslims should use that as an excuse to break the treaty and confiscate the church. The [[Mosque of Omar]], opposite the doors of the Anastasis, with the tall minaret, is known as the place to which he retired for his prayer.

Bishop [[Arculf]], whose account of his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in the 7th century, [[De Locis Sanctis]], written down by the monk Adamnan, described reasonably pleasant living conditions of Christians in Palestine in the first period of Muslim rule. The caliphs of Damascus (661-750) were tolerant princes who were on generally good terms with their Christian subjects. Many Christians (e.g. St. John Damascene) held important offices at their court. The Abbasid caliphs at Baghdad (753-1242), as long as they ruled Syria, were also tolerant to Christians. Harun Abu-Ja-'afar (786-809), sent the keys of the [[Holy Sepulchre]] to Charlemagne, who built a hospice for Latin pilgrims near the shrine.&lt;ref name="Catholic Jerusalem" /&gt;

Rival dynasties and revolutions led to the eventual disunion of the Muslim world. In the 9th century, Palestine was conquered by the Shia Fatimid dynasty of North Africa. Palestine once again became a battleground as the various enemies of the Fatimids attacked. At the same time, the Byzantine Greeks continued to attempt to regain their lost territories, including Jerusalem. Christians in Jerusalem who sided with the Byzantines were put to death for high treason by the ruling shiite Muslims. In 969, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, John VII, was put to death for treasonous correspondence with the Byzantines. As Jerusalem grew in importance to Muslims and pilgrimages increased, tolerance for other religions declined. Christians were persecuted and churches destroyed. The sixth shia Fatimid caliph, [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|Caliph Al-Hakim]], 996-1021, who was believed to be "God made manifest" by the [[Druze]], destroyed the Holy Sepulchre in 1009. This powerful provocation helped ignite the flame of fury that led to the [[First Crusade]].&lt;ref name="Catholic Jerusalem" /&gt;

It used to be argued that [[Zoroastrianism]] quickly collapsed in the wake of the [[Islamic conquest of Persia]] due to its intimate ties to the [[Sassanid]] state structure.&lt;ref name="Berkey"/&gt; Now however, more complex processes are considered, in light of the more protracted time frame attributed to the progression of the ancient Persian religion to a minority; a progression that is more contiguous with the trends of the [[late antiquity]] period.&lt;ref name="Berkey"/&gt; These trends are the conversions from the state religion that had already plagued the Zoroastrian authorities that continued after the Arab conquest, coupled with the migration of Arab tribes into the region during an extended period of time that stretched well into the Abbassid reign.&lt;ref name="Berkey"/&gt;

While there were cases such as the Sassanid army division at Hamra, that converted ''en masse'' before pivotal battles such as the [[Battle of al-Qādisiyyah]], conversion was fastest in the [[urban area]]s where Arab forces were [[garrison]]ed slowly leading to Zoroastrianism becoming associated with [[rural]] areas.&lt;ref name="Berkey"/&gt; Still at the end of the Umayyad period, the Muslim community was only a minority in the region.&lt;ref name="Berkey"/&gt;

Through the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], in the 7th century, Islam spread as far as the [[North Caucasus]], which parts of it (notably [[Dagestan]]) were part of the [[Sasanid Empire|Sasanid]] domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote="(..)

Islam was readily accepted by Zoroastrians who were employed in industrial and artisan positions because, according to Zoroastrian dogma, such occupations that involved defiling fire made them impure.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; Moreover, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenets to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], for the Persian, he would meet [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Ahriman]] under the names of [[Allah]] and [[Iblis]].&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; At times, [[Muslim]] leaders in their effort to win converts encouraged attendance at Muslim prayer with promises of money and allowed the [[Quran]] to be recited in [[Persian language|Persian]] instead of Arabic so that it would be intelligible to all.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

A number of the inhabitants of [[Afghanistan]] accepted Islam through [[Umayyad]] missionary efforts, particularly under the reign of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] and [[Umar ibn AbdulAziz]].&lt;ref&gt;The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith, By Thomas Walker Arnold, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Later, starting from the 9th century, the [[Samanids]], whose roots stemmed from Zoroastrian theocratic nobility, propagated [[Sunni Islam]] and Islamo-Persian culture deep into the heart of Central Asia. The population within its areas began firmly accepting Islam in significant numbers, notably in [[Taraz]], now in modern-day [[Kazakhstan]]. The first complete translation of the [[Qur'an]] into [[Persian language|Persian]] occurred during the reign of Samanids in the 9th century.  According to historians, through the zealous missionary work of Samanid rulers, as many as 30,000 tents of [[Turkish people|Turks]] came to profess Islam and later under the [[Ghaznavids]] higher than 55,000 under the [[Hanafi]] school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Iran By Elton L. Daniel, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Saffarid dynasty|Saffarids]] and Samanids, the [[Ghaznavids]] re-conquered Transoxania, and invaded the [[Indian subcontinent]] in the 11th century. This was followed by the [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]] and [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]] who further expanded the culture of Islam.

Contrary to popular belief, Islam came to South Asia prior to the [[Muslim invasions of India]]. Islamic influence first came to be felt in the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the early 7th century with the advent of Arab traders. Arab traders used to visit the [[Malabar region]], which was a link between them and the ports of [[South East Asia]] to trade even before Islam had been established in Arabia. According to Historians Elliot and Dowson in their book ''[[The History of India as told by its own Historians]]'', the first ship bearing Muslim travelers was seen on the Indian coast as early as 630&amp;nbsp;CE. The first Indian mosque is thought to have been built in 629&amp;nbsp;CE, purportedly at the behest of an unknown Chera dynasty ruler, during the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] ([[Circa|c.]]&amp;nbsp;571–632) in [[Kodungallur]], in district of [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]] by [[Malik Bin Deenar]]. In Malabar, Muslims are called [[Mappila]].

In [[Bengal]], Arab merchants helped found the port of [[Chittagong]]. [[Sufi]] missionaries settled in the region as early as the 8th century.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newagebd.com/supliment.php?a=arc&amp;date=2012-12-07&amp;sid=167 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225232041/http://www.newagebd.com/supliment.php?a=arc&amp;date=2012-12-07&amp;sid=167 |archivedate=2013-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

H. G. Rawlinson, in his book ''Ancient and Medieval History of India'' ({{ISBN|81-86050-79-5}}), claims the first Arab Muslims settled on the Indian coast in the last part of the 7th century. This fact is corroborated, by J. Sturrock in his ''South Kanara and Madras Districts Manuals'',&lt;ref&gt;Sturrock, J., South Canara and Madras District Manual (2 vols., Madras, 1894-1895)&lt;/ref&gt; and also by Haridas Bhattacharya in ''Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|81-85843-05-8}} Cultural Heritage of India Vol. IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab merchants and traders became the carriers of the new religion and they propagated it wherever they went.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaihoon.com/watan/indarbmappilacommunity.htm -Genesis and Growth of the Mappila Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622220846/http://jaihoon.com/watan/indarbmappilacommunity.htm |date=2006-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was however the subsequent expansion of the [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] over the next millennia that established Islam in the region.

Embedded within these lies the concept of Islam as a foreign imposition and [[Hinduism]] being a natural condition of the natives who resisted, resulting the failure of the project to Islamicize the Indian subcontinent and is highly embroiled with the politics of the [[Partition of India|partition]] and [[communalism]] in India.&lt;ref name="der Veer"&gt;der Veer, pg 27-29&lt;/ref&gt; These are typically represented by the following schools of thought:&lt;ref name="der Veer"/&gt;
#That the bulk of Muslims are descendants of migrants from the [[Iranian plateau]] or Arabs.&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, "5. Mass Conversion to Islam: Theories and Protagonists"&lt;/ref&gt;
#A related view is that conversions occurred for non-religious reasons of pragmatism and patronage such as social mobility among the Muslim ruling elite or for relief from taxes&lt;ref name="der Veer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eaton"/&gt;
#Was a combination, initially made under duress followed by a genuine change of heart&lt;ref name="der Veer"/&gt;
#As a socio-cultural process of diffusion and integration over an extended period of time into the sphere of the dominant [[Muslim world|Muslim civilization and global polity]] at large.&lt;ref name="Eaton"/&gt;

Muslim missionaries played a key role in the spread of Islam in India with some missionaries even assuming roles as merchants or traders. For example, in the 9th century, the [[Ismailis]] sent missionaries across [[Asia]] in all directions under various guises, often as traders, Sufis and merchants.  Ismailis were instructed to speak potential converts in their own language.  Some Ismaili missionaries traveled to [[India]] and employed effort to make their religion acceptable to the Hindus.  For instance, they represented [[Ali]] as the tenth avatar of [[Vishnu]] and wrote hymns as well as a [[mahdi]] [[puranas|purana]] in their effort to win converts.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt; At other times, converts were won in conjunction with the propagation efforts of rulers. According to [[Ibn Batuta]], the [[Khalji dynasty|Khaljis]] encouraged conversion to [[Islam]] by making it a custom to have the convert presented to the Sultan who would place a robe on the convert and award him with bracelets of gold.&lt;ref&gt;The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Ikhtiyar Uddin Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khilji|Ikhtiyar Uddin Bakhtiyar Khilji's]] control of the [[Bengal]], Muslim missionaries in India achieved their greatest success, in terms of number of converts to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir Thomas Walker Arnold, pp. 227-228&lt;/ref&gt;

Even before Islam was established amongst Indonesian communities, Muslim sailors and traders had often visited the shores of modern Indonesia, most of these early sailors and merchants arrived from the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]'s newly established ports of [[Basra]] and [[Debal]], many of the earliest Muslim accounts of the region note the presence of animals such as [[Orang-utan]]s, [[Rhinoceros|Rhinos]] and valuable [[Spice trade]] commodities such as [[Cloves]], [[Nutmeg]], [[Galangal]] and [[Coconut]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sinbad the Sailor]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam came to the [[Southeast Asia]], first by the way of Muslim traders along the main trade-route between Asia and the [[Far East]], then was further spread by [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]] and finally consolidated by the expansion of the territories of converted rulers and their communities.&lt;ref name="Camb"&gt;P.

When [[Marco Polo]] visited the area in 1292 he noted that the urban port state of [[Peureulak|Perlak]] was Muslim,&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt; Chinese sources record the presence of a Muslim delegation to the emperor from the [[Pasai|Kingdom of Samudra (Pasai)]] in 1282,&lt;ref name="Camb"/&gt; other accounts provide instances of Muslim communities present in the [[Melayu Kingdom]] for the same time period while others record the presence of Muslim Chinese traders from provinces such as [[Fujian]].&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt; The spread of Islam generally followed the trade routes east through the primarily [[Buddhist]] region and a half century later in the [[Malacca]]'s we see the first dynasty arise in the form of the [[Sultanate of Malacca]] at the far end of the Archipelago form by the conversion of one [[Parameswara (sultan)|Parameswara Dewa Shah]] into a Muslim and the adoption of the name Muhammad Iskandar Shah&lt;ref&gt;He changes his name to reflect his new religion.&lt;/ref&gt; after his marriage to a daughter of the ruler of Pasai.&lt;ref name="Camb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt;

As commerce grew in the region with the rest of the Muslim world, Islamic influence extended to the court even as the empires political power waned and so by the time [[Raja]] Kertawijaya converted in 1475 at the hands of Sufi [[Sheikh]] Rahmat, the Sultanate was already of a Muslim character.

Another driving force for the change of the ruling class in the region was the concept among the increasing Muslim communities of the region when ruling dynasties to attempt to forge such ties of kinship by marriage.&lt;ref name="Nazeer"/&gt; By the time the [[Colonialism|colonial]] powers and their [[missionaries]] arrived in the 17th century the region up to [[New Guinea]] was overwhelmingly Muslim with [[animist]] minorities.&lt;ref name="colin"/&gt;

Around the 7th  and 8th centuries some states of Turkic peoples existed - like the [[Khazars|Turkic Khazar Khaganate]] (see ''[[Khazar-Arab Wars]]'') and the [[Turgesh|Turkic Turgesh Khaganate]], which fought against the caliphate in order to stop [[Arabization]] and [[Islamization]] in Asia. From the 9th century onwards, the Turks (at least individually, if not yet through adoption by their states) began to convert to Islam. Histories merely note the fact of pre-[[Mongol]] [[Central Asia]]'s Islamization.&lt;ref name="Devin2"&gt;Devin pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Volga Bulgaria|Bulgars of the Volga]] (to whom the modern [[Volga Tatars]] trace their Islamic roots) adopted Islam by the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Devin2"/&gt; under [[Almış]]. When the [[Franciscan]] [[friar]] [[William of Rubruck]] visited the encampment of [[Batu Khan]] of the [[Golden Horde]], who had recently (in the 1240s) completed the [[Mongol invasion of Volga Bulgaria]], he noted "I wonder what devil carried the law of Machomet there".&lt;ref name="Devin2"/&gt;

Another contemporary institution identified as Muslim, the [[Qarakhanid dynasty]] of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], operated much further east,&lt;ref name="Devin2"/&gt; established by [[Karluks]] who became Islamized after converting under [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] in the mid-10th century. However, the modern-day history of the Islamization of the region - or rather a conscious affiliation with Islam - dates to the reign of the ''[[Ulus of Jochi|ulus]]'' of the son of [[Genghis Khan]], [[Jochi]], who founded the Golden Horde,&lt;ref name="Devin3"&gt;Devin pg 67-69&lt;/ref&gt; which operated from the 1240s to 1502. [[Kazakhs]], [[Uzbeks]] and some Muslim populations of the [[Russian Federation]] trace their Islamic roots to the Golden Horde&lt;ref name="Devin2"/&gt; and while [[Berke|Berke Khan]] became the first Mongol monarch to officially adopt Islam and even to oppose his kinsman [[Hulagu|Hulagu Khan]]&lt;ref name="Devin2"/&gt; in the defense of [[Jerusalem]] at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] (1263), only much later did the change became pivotal when the Mongols converted ''en masse''&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;Daniel W. Brown, "'' New Introduction to Islam''", Blackwell Publishing, August 1, 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-21604-9}} pg. 185-187&lt;/ref&gt; when a century later [[Uzbeg Khan]] (lived 1282-1341) converted - reportedly at the hands of the [[Sufi]] [[Saint]] Baba Tukles.&lt;ref&gt;Devin 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the Mongolian tribes became Islamized. Following the brutal [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia]] under [[Hulagu Khan]] and after the [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)]], Mongol rule extended across the breadth of almost all Muslim lands in [[Asia]]. The Mongols destroyed the caliphate and [[Persecution of Muslims#Mongol persecution of Muslims|persecuted Islam]], replacing it with [[Buddhism]] as the official state religion.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; In 1295 however, the new Khan of the [[Ilkhanate]], [[Ghazan]], converted to Islam, and two decades later the Golden Horde under Uzbeg Khan (reigned 1313-1341) followed suit.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; The Mongols had been religiously and culturally conquered; this absorption ushered in a new age of Mongol-Islamic synthesis&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; that shaped the further spread of Islam in central Asia and the [[Indian subcontinent]].

In the 1330s, the Mongol ruler of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] (in Central Asia) converted to Islam, causing the eastern part of his realm (called [[Moghulistan]]) to rebel.&lt;ref name="Xian"&gt;S.

Sharpe, April 1, 2004 {{ISBN|0-7656-1317-4}} pg. 46-48&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the next three centuries these [[Buddhist]], [[Shaman]]istic and [[Christian]] Turkic and Mongol nomads of the [[Kazakh Steppe]] and [[Xinjiang]] would also convert at the hands of competing [[Tariqah|Sufi orders]] from both east and west of the [[Pamirs]].&lt;ref name="Xian"/&gt; The [[Naqshbandi]]s are the most prominent of these orders, especially in [[Kashgaria]], where the western Chagatai Khan was also a disciple of the order.&lt;ref name="Xian"/&gt;

No previous conqueror had tried to assimilate the Berbers, but the Arabs quickly converted them and enlisted their aid in further conquests. Without their help, for example, Andalusia could never have been incorporated into the Islamic state. At first only Berbers nearer the coast were involved, but by the 11th century Muslim affiliation had begun to spread far into the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Britannica]] | year=2007 | title=Islamic world - Berbers | url = http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-26922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional historical view is that the conquest of North Africa by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate between CE&amp;nbsp;647–709 effectively ended Catholicism in Africa for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bethel.edu/~letnie/AfricanChristianity/WesternNorthAfricaHomepage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202083455/http://www.bethel.edu/~letnie/AfricanChristianity/WesternNorthAfricaHomepage.html |archivedate=2007-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, new scholarship has appeared that provides more nuance and details of the conversion of the Christian inhabitants to Islam. A Christian community is recorded in 1114 in Qal'a in central Algeria. There is also evidence of religious pilgrimages after 850&amp;nbsp;CE to tombs of Catholic saints outside of the city of Carthage, and evidence of religious contacts with Christians of Arab Spain. In addition, calendar reforms adopted in Europe at this time were disseminated amongst the indigenous Christians of Tunis, which would have not been possible had there been an absence of contact with Rome. During the reign of [[Umar II]], the then governor of Africa, Ismail ibn Abdullah, was said to have won the [[Berbers]] to Islam by his just administration, and other early notable missionaries include [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] who started a movement which caused thousands of [[Berbers]] to accept Islam.&lt;ref name="Arnold"&gt;The preaching of Islam: a history of the propagation of the Muslim faith By Sir [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], pp.125-258&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zeila, Somalia.jpg|150px|thumb|right|The port and waterfront of [[Zeila]].]]
The history of commercial and intellectual contact between the inhabitants of the [[Somalia|Somali coast]] and the [[Arabian Peninsula]] may help explain the [[Somali people]]'s connection with [[Muhammad]]. The early Muslims fled to the port city of [[Zeila]] in modern-day northern [[Somalia]] to seek protection from the Quraysh at the court of the [[Aksumite Empire|Aksumite Emperor]] in present-day [[Ethiopia]]. Some of the Muslims that were granted protection are said to have then settled in several parts of the Horn region to promote the religion. The victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh in the 7th century had a significant impact on local merchants and sailors, as their trading partners in Arabia had then all adopted [[Islam]], and the major trading routes in the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]] came under the sway of the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Muslim Caliphs]]. Through commerce, Islam spread amongst the Somali population in the coastal cities. Instability in the Arabian peninsula saw further migrations of early Muslim families to the Somali seaboard. These clans came to serve as catalysts, forwarding the faith to large parts of the Horn region.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;

[[File:GreatMosque.jpg|150px|thumb|left|The Great Mosque of [[Kilwa Kisiwani]], made of [[Coral|coral stones]] is the largest Mosque of its kind.]]
On the east coast of Africa, where Arab mariners had for many years journeyed to trade, mainly in slaves, Arabs founded permanent colonies on the offshore islands, especially on [[Zanzibar]], in the 9th and 10th century. From there Arab trade routes into the interior of Africa helped the slow acceptance of Islam.

By the 10th century, the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] was founded by [[Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi]] (was one of seven sons of a ruler of [[Shiraz]], Persia, his mother an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] slave girl. Upon his father's death, Ali was driven out of his inheritance by his brothers). His successors would rule the most powerful of [[Sultanate]]s in the [[Swahili coast]], during the peak of its expansion the [[Kilwa Sultanate]] stretched from [[Inhambane]] in the south to [[Malindi]] in the north. The 13th-century [[Muslim]] traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] noted that the great mosque of [[Kilwa Kisiwani]] was made of [[Coral|coral stone]] (the only one of its kind in the world).

In the 20th century, Islam grew in Africa both by birth and by conversion.  The number of Muslims in Africa grew from 34.5 million in 1900 to 315 million in 2000, going from roughly 20% to 40% of the total population of Africa.&lt;ref name="valpo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/cresset/2009/Trinity/Sanneh_T09.htm|title=The Return of Religion: Currents of Resurgence, Convergence, and Divergence- The Cresset (Trinity 2009)|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the same time period, the number of Christians also grew in Africa, from 8.7 million in 1900 to 346 million in 2000, surpassing both the total population as well as the growth rate of Islam on the continent.&lt;ref name="valpo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/facts/fm0146.htm|title=Christian Number-Crunching reveals impressive growth|accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Islam in Africa began in the 7th to 9th century, brought to North Africa initially under the [[Umayyad Dynasty]].  Extensive trade networks throughout North and West Africa created a medium through which Islam spread peacefully, initially through the merchant class. By sharing a common religion and a common transliteralization ([[Arabic]]), traders showed greater willingness to trust, and therefore invest, in one another.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14758.ctl Paul Stoller, "Money Has No Smell: The Africanization of New York City," Chicago: University of Chicago Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223162442/http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/14758.ctl |date=2007-12-23 }} {{ISBN|978-0-226-77529-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, toward the 18th century, the [[Nigeria]] based [[Sokoto Caliphate]] led by [[Usman dan Fodio]] exerted considerable effort in spreading Islam.&lt;ref name="Arnold" /&gt;

===Europe===
[[Tariq ibn Ziyad]] was a [[Muslim]] general who led the Islamic conquest of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] [[Hispania]] in 711-718 A.D. He is considered to be one of the most important military commanders in [[Iberia]]n history. The name "[[Gibraltar]]" is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] derivation of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name ''Jabal Tāriq'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|جبل طارق}}}}) (meaning "mountain of Tariq"), named after him.

There are accounts of the [[Volga trade route|trade connections]] between the Muslims and the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], apparently Vikings who made their way towards the [[Black Sea]] through [[European Russia|Central Russia]].  On his way to Volga Bulgaria, [[Ibn Fadlan]] brought detailed reports of the Rus, claiming that some had converted to [[Islam]].

According to the historian [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]], the [[Böszörmény]] (''Izmaelita or ''Ismaili{{\}}[[Nizari]]'') denomination of the Muslims who lived in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in the 10th to 13th centuries, were employed as mercenaries by the kings of Hungary.

The history of Arab and Islamic rule in the Iberian peninsula is probably one of the most studied periods of European history. For centuries after the Arab conquest, European accounts of Arab rule in Iberia were negative. European points of view started changing with the [[Protestant Reformation]], which resulted in new descriptions of the period of Islamic rule in Spain as a "golden age" (mostly as a reaction against Spain's militant Roman Catholicism after 1500){{citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

The tide of Arab expansion after 630 rolled through North Africa up to Ceuta in present-day Morocco. Their arrival coincided with a period of political weakness in the three centuries old kingdom established in the Iberian peninsula by the Germanic [[Visigoths]], who had taken over the region after seven centuries of Roman rule. Seizing the opportunity, an Arab-led (but mostly Berber) army invaded in 711, and by 720 had conquered the southern and central regions of the peninsula. The Arab expansion pushed over the mountains into southern [[France]], and for a short period Arabs controlled the old Visigothic province of Septimania (centered on present-day Narbonne). The Arab Caliphate was pushed back by [[Charles Martel]] (King of the Franks or French) at Poitiers, and Christian armies started pushing southwards over the mountains, until [[Charlemagne]] established in 801 the Spanish March (which stretched from Barcelona to present day Navarre).

A major development in the history of Muslim Spain was the dynastic change in 750 in the Arab Caliphate, when an Umayyad Prince escaped the slaughter of his family in Damascus, fled to Cordoba in Spain, and created a new Islamic state in the area. This was the start of a distinctly Spanish Muslim society, where large Christian and Jewish populations coexisted with an increasing percentage of Muslims. There are many stories of descendants of Visigothic chieftains and Roman counts whose families converted to Islam during this period. The at-first small Muslim elite continued to grow with converts, and with a few exceptions, rulers in Islamic Spain allowed Christians and Jews the right specified in the Koran to practice their own religions, though non-Muslims suffered from political and taxation inequities. The net result was, in those areas of Spain where Muslim rule lasted the longest, the creation of a society that was mostly Arabic-speaking because of the assimilation of native inhabitants, a process in some ways similar to the assimilation many years later of millions of immigrants to the United States into English-speaking culture.  At the descendants of Visigoths and Hispano-Romans concentrated in the north of the peninsula, in the kingdoms of Asturias/Leon, Navarre and Aragon and started a long campaign known as the 'Reconquista' which started with the victory of the Christian armies in [[Covadonga]] in 722.  Military campaigns continued without pause.  In 1085 Alfonso VI of Castille took back Toledo.  In 1212 the crucial [[Battle of Las Navas de Tolosa]] meant the recovery of the bulk of the peninsula for the Christian kingdoms.  In 1238 James I of Aragon  took Valencia.  In 1236 the ancient Roman city of [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Cordoba]] was re-conquered by Ferdinand III of Castille and in 1248 the city of [[Seville]].  The famous medieval epic poem '[[Cantar de Mio Cid]]' narrates the life and deeds of this hero during the [[Reconquista]].

The Islamic state centered in Cordoba had ended up splintering into many smaller kingdoms (the so-called taifas). While Muslim Spain was fragmenting, the Christian kingdoms grew larger and stronger, and the balance of power shifted against the 'Taifa' kingdoms. The last Muslim kingdom of Granada in the south was finally taken in 1492 by Queen Isabelle of Castille and Ferdinand of Aragon. In 1499, the remaining Muslim inhabitants were ordered to convert or leave (at the same time the Jews were expelled). Poorer Muslims ([[Moriscos]]) who could not afford to leave ended up converting to Catholic Christianity and hiding their Muslim practices, hiding from the Spanish Inquisition, until their presence was finally extinguished.

====Balkans====
{{see also|Rumelia|Balkans|Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Mošeja-Log pod Mangartom4.jpg|right|thumb|260px|Pre-[[World War I]] [[Slovenia]]n [[mosque]] in the town of [[Log pod Mangartom]].]]
In Balkan history, historical writing on the topic of conversion to Islam was, and still is, a highly charged political issue. It is intrinsically linked to the issues of formation of national identities and rival territorial claims of the Balkan states. The generally accepted nationalist discourse of the current Balkan historiography defines all forms of Islamization as results of the Ottoman government's centrally organized policy of conversion or ''[[dawah]]''. The truth is that Islamization in each Balkan country took place in the course of many centuries, and its nature and phase was determined not by the Ottoman government but by the specific conditions of each locality. Ottoman conquests were initially military and economic enterprises, and religious conversions were not their primary objective. True, the statements surrounding victories all celebrated the incorporation of territory into Muslim domains, but the actual Ottoman focus was on taxation and making the realms productive, and a religious campaign would have disrupted that economic objective.

Ottoman Islamic standards of toleration allowed for autonomous "nations" (''[[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millets]]'') in the Empire, under their own personal law and under the rule of their own religious leaders. As a result, vast areas of the Balkans remained mostly Christian during the period of Ottoman domination. In fact, the Eastern Orthodox Churches had a higher position in the Ottoman Empire, mainly because the Patriarch resided in Istanbul and was an officer of the Ottoman Empire. In contrast, Roman Catholics, while tolerated, were suspected of loyalty to a foreign power (the Papacy). It is no surprise that the Roman Catholic areas of Bosnia, Kosovo and northern Albania, ended up with more substantial conversions to Islam. The defeat of the Ottomans in 1699 by the Austrians resulted in their loss of Hungary and present-day Croatia. The remaining Muslim converts in both elected to leave "lands of unbelief" and moved to territory still under the Ottomans. Around this point in time, new European ideas of romantic nationalism started to seep into the Empire, and provided the intellectual foundation for new nationalistic ideologies and the reinforcement of the self-image of many Christian groups as subjugated peoples.

[[File:Bangladeshi family in Jabal al-Nur, Makkah.jpg|thumb|300px|A Bangladeshi family in [[Makkah]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. Over 3 million Bangladeshi migrants live in Saudi Arabia as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/population/meetings/EGM_Ittmig_Arab/P02_Kapiszewski.pdf Asians in the Middle East]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
As a rule, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] did not require followers of Greek Orthodoxy to become [[Muslim]]s, although many did so in order to avert the socioeconomic hardships of Ottoman rule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pontosworld.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1387&amp;Itemid=90|title=PontosWorld|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
One by one, the Balkan nationalities asserted their independence from the Empire, and frequently the presence of members of the same ethnicity who had converted to Islam presented a problem from the point of view of the now dominant new national ideology, which narrowly defined the nation as members of the local dominant Orthodox Christian denomination.&lt;ref name="Blumi32"/&gt; Some Muslims in the Balkans chose to leave, while [[Persecution of Muslims|many others were forcefully expelled]] to what was left of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name="Blumi32"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blumi|first=Isa|title=Reinstating the Ottomans, Alternative Balkan Modernities: 1800–1912|year=2011|location=New York  |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=ca3IAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Reinstating+the+Ottomans,+Alternative+Balkan+Modernities:+1800-1912&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20expulsion%20of%20the%20%E2%80%9CTurks%E2%80%9D%20(i.e.%2C%20Muslims)&amp;f=false|isbn=9780230119086|pages=32|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This demographic transition can be illustrated by the decrease in the number of mosques in [[Belgrade]], from over 70 in 1750 (before Serbian independence in 1815), to only three in 1850.

====Immigration====
Since the 1960s, many Muslims have migrated to Western Europe. They have come as immigrants, [[guest workers]], asylum seekers or as part of [[family reunification]]. As a result, [[Muslims in Europe|Muslim population in Europe]] has steadily risen.

The writer [[Bat Ye'or]] stated in her book "[[Eurabia]]" that Muslims may become a majority within a few generations due to continued [[immigration]] and high [[birth rates]]. This theory has been criticized, however. Many suggest the claims are built on unreliable claims and that fertility rates of Muslims will eventually decrease and that immigration to European nations could be limited.

This can involve property rights, status, or [[Health equity|unequal access to health care]], housing, education and other physical or financial resources or opportunities. Structural inequality is believed to be an embedded part of the culture of the United States due to the history of slavery and the subsequent suppression of equal civil rights of minority races. Structural inequality has been encouraged and maintained in the society of the United States through structured institutions such as the public school system with the goal of maintaining the existing structure of wealth, employment opportunities, and social standing of the races by keeping minority students from high academic achievement in high school and college as well as in the workforce of the country. In the attempt to equalize allocation of state funding, policymakers evaluate the elements of disparity to determine an equalization of funding throughout school districts.p.(14)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wallacefoundation.org/knowledge-center/Documents/Preparing-School-Leaders.pdf|title=Preparing School Leaders for a Changing World: Lessons from Exemplary Leadership Development Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policymakers have to determine a formula based of per-pupil revenue and the student need.p.(8)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may08/vol65/num08/Creating-Excellent-and-Equitable-Schools.aspx|title=Creating Excellent and Equitable Schools|author=Linda Darling-Hammond, Diane Friedlaender|journal=Educational Leadership|volume=65|issue=8|date=May 2008|pages=14–21|issn=0013-1784}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Critical race theory]] is part of the ongoing oppression of minorities in the public school system and the corporate workforce that limits academic and career success. The public school system maintains structural inequality through such practices as tracking of students, [[standardized assessment]] tests, and a teaching force that does not represent the diversity of the student body.&lt;ref name="Liao" /&gt; Also see [[social inequality]], [[racism]], [[discrimination]], and [[oppression]]. Social inequality occurs when certain groups in a society do not have equal [[social status]]. Aspects of social status involve [[property rights]], [[voting rights]], [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly]], access to [[health care]], and [[education]] as well as many other social commodities.

==Education: student tracking==

Education is the base for equality.&lt;ref name="Grob" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Grob|first=M.|title=Educational systems and perceived social inequality|journal=European Societies|year=2003|volume=5|issue=2|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically in the structuring of schools, the concept of [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] is believed by some scholars to create a social disparity in providing students an equal education.&lt;ref name="Oakes" &gt;{{cite book|last=Oakes|first=J.|title=Tracking|year=1986|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Schools have been found to have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views.  Schools not only provide education but also a setting for students to develop into adults, form future [[social status]] and roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society.&lt;ref name="Grob"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt;  Tracking is an educational term that indicates where students will be placed during their secondary school years.&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;  "Depending on how early students are separated into these tracks, determines the difficulty in changing from one track to another" (Grob, 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;202).&lt;ref name="Grob"/&gt;

[[Tracking (education)|Tracking]] or sorting categorizes students into different groups based on [[standardized test]] scores.  These groups or tracks are vocational, general, and academic.  Students are sorted into groups that will determine educational and vocational outcomes for the future.&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt; The sorting that occurs in the educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society.  Thus, students are viewed and treated differently according to their individual track.  Each track has a designed curriculum that is meant to fit the unique educational and social needs of each sorted group.&lt;ref name="Oakes"/&gt; Consequently, the information taught as well as the expectations of the teachers differ based on the track resulting in the creation of dissimilar classroom cultures.

Not only the classes that students take, but the school they are enrolled in has been shown to have an effect on their educational success and [[social mobility]], especially ability to graduate from college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deli-Amen|first=Regina|author2=Deluca |title=The Underserved Third: How Our Educational Structures Populate an Educational Underclass|journal=Journal of Educational Studies for Students Placed at Risk|date=19 April 2010|volume=15|pages=27–50|doi=10.1080/10824661003634948}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simply being enrolled in a school with less access to resources, or in an area with a high concentration of racial minorities, makes one much less likely to gain access to prestigious four-year colleges. For example, there are far fewer first time freshmen within the [[University of California]] (UC) system who graduate from schools where the majority population is an underrepresented racial minority group. Students from these schools comprise only 22.1% of the first time freshmen within the UC system, whereas students from majority white schools make up 65.3% of the first time freshman population.&lt;ref name= "Teranishi" &gt;{{cite journal|last=Teranishi|first=Robert|author2=Parker |title=Social Reproduction of Inequality: The Racial Composition of Feeder Schools to the University of California|journal=Teachers College Record|date=June 2010|volume=112|issue=6|pages=1575–1601}}&lt;/ref&gt; At more prestigious schools, like UC Berkeley, the division is even more pronounced. Only 15.2% of first time freshmen who attend the university came from schools with a high percentage of underrepresented minorities.&lt;ref name="Teranishi" /&gt;

Issues of structural inequality are probably also at fault for the low numbers of students from underserved backgrounds graduating from college. Out of the entire population of low-income youth in the US, only 13% receive a bachelor's degree by the time they are 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feliciano|first=C.|author2=Oseguera |title=Early and later PSE pathways of young adults from low-income families|journal=Presentation at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of Higher Education|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Students from racial minorities are similarly disadvantaged. Hispanic students are half as likely to attend college than white students and black students are 25% less likely. Despite increased attention and educational reform, this gap has increased in the past 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=National Center for Education Statistics|title=Issue Brief: Postsecondary Participation Rates by Sex and Race/Ethnicity: 1974–2003|date=March 2005|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The costs required to attend college also contribute to the structural inequality in education. The higher educational system in the United States relies on public funding to support the universities. However, even with the public funding, policymakers have voiced their desire to have universities become less dependent on government funding and to compete for other sources of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Scott|last2=Zarifa|first2=David|year=|title=The stratification of universities: Structural inequality in Canada and the United States|url=|journal=Research in Social Stratification and Mobility|volume=|pages=|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of this could sway many students from low-income backgrounds from attending higher institutions due to the inability of paying to attend. In a 2013 study by the National Center for Educational Statistics, only 49% of students from low-income families that graduated from high school immediately enrolled into college.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kena, G., Musu-Gillette, L., Robinson, J., Wang, X., Rathbun, A., Zhang, J., Wilkinson-Flicker, S., Barmer, A., and Dunlop Velez, E.

==Access to technology==

Gaps in the availability of technology, the [[digital divide]], are gradually decreasing as more people purchase home computers and the ratio of students to computers within schools continues to decreases.  However, inequities in access to technology still exist due to the lack of teacher training and, subsequently, confidence in use of technologic tools; the diverse needs of students; and administrative pressures to increase test scores.&lt;ref name="Chapman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=L.|author2=Masters, L. |author3=Pedulla, J |title=Do digital divisions still persist in schools? Access to technology and technical skills of teachers in high needs schools in the United States of America|journal=Journal of Education for Research|year=2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=239–249|doi=10.1080/02607471003651870}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warschauer|first=M.|author2=Knobel, M. |author3=Stone, L. |title=Technology and equity in schooling: Deconstructing the digital divide|journal=Educational Policy|year=2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=562–588|doi=10.1177/0895904804266469}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These inequities are noticeably different between high need (HN) and low need (LN) populations. In a survey of teachers participating in an [[e-Learning]] for Educators online professional development workshop, Chapman&lt;ref name="Chapman" /&gt; finds that HN schools need increased access and teacher training in technology resources. Though results vary in their level of significance, teachers of non-HN schools report more confidence in having adequate technical abilities to simply participate in the workshop; later surveys showed that teachers of HN schools report that "they use, or will use, technology in the classroom more after the workshop" less likely that that of teachers of non-HN schools.  Additionally, teachers from HN schools report less access to technology as well as lower technical skills and abilities (p.&amp;nbsp;246).  Even when teachers in low-SES schools had confidence in their technical skills, other they faced other obstacles, including larger numbers of English language learners and at-risk students, larger numbers of students with limited computer experience, and greater pressure to increase test scores and adhere to policy mandates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warschauer|first=M.|author2=Matuchniak, T. |title=New technology and digital worlds: Analyzing evidence of equity in access, use, and outcomes|journal=Review of Research in Education|year=2010|volume=34|issue=1|pages=179–225|doi=10.3102/0091732x09349791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other structural inequalities in access to technology exist in differences in the ratio of students to computers within public schools.  Correlations show that as the number of minorities enrolled in a school increase so, too, does the ratio of students to computers, 4.0:1 in schools with 50% or more minority enrollment versus 3.1 in schools with 6% or less minority enrollment (as cited in Warschauer, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;188-189). Within school structures, low-[[socioeconomic status]] (SES) schools tended to have less stable teaching staff, administrative staff, and IT support staff, which contributed to teachers being less likely to incorporate technology in their curriculum for lack of support.&lt;ref name="Warschauer" /&gt;

==Disabilities==

The challenge of the new millennium will include a realignment in focus to include "the curriculum as disabled, rather than students, their insights in translating principles of universal design, which originated in architecture, to education commensurate with advances characterized as a major paradigm shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edyburn|first=D.|author2=Gardner |title=Instructional design advances in special education technology|journal=Exceptionality|year=2009|volume=17|issue=2|pages=63–65|doi=10.1080/09362830902805699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), children with disabilities have the right to a free appropriate public education in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE).   The LRE means that children with disabilities must be educated in regular classrooms with their non-disabled peers with the appropriate supports and services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Proctor|first=Briley, E|date=2001|title=Social policy and its application to students with learning disabilities in U.S. institutes of higher education|url=|journal=The International Journal of Sociology and Social Policy|volume=21|pages=38-59|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual with a disability is also protected under American with Disabilities Act (ADA) which is defined as any person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Assistive technology which supports individuals with disabilities covering a wide range of areas from cognitive to physical limitations, plays an important role.

==School finance==

School finance is another area where [[social injustice]] and [[Social inequality|inequality]] might exist.  Districts in wealthier areas typically receive more Average Daily Attendance (ADA) funds for total (e.g. restricted and unrestricted) expenditures per pupil than socio-economically disadvantaged districts, therefore, a wealthier school district will receive more funding than a socio-economically disadvantaged school district. "Most U.S. schools are underfunded. Schools in low wealth states and districts are especially hard hit, with inadequate instructional materials, little technology, unsafe buildings, and less-qualified teachers" (p.&amp;nbsp;31)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glickman, Glickman, Gordon, Ross-Gordon|title=Supervision and instructional leadership|year=2007|publisher=Pearson Education|location=San Francisco, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method in which funds are distributed or allocated within a school district can also be of concern.  De facto segregation can occur in districts or educational organizations that passively promote racial segregation. Epstein (2006) stated the "Two years after the victorious Supreme Court decision against segregation, Oakland's"... "school board increased Oakland's segregation by spending $40 million from a bond election to build..." a "... High School, and then establishing a ten-mile long, two-mile wide attendance boundary, which effectively excluded almost every black and Latino student in the city" (p.&amp;nbsp;28).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Epstein|first=K.|title=A different view of urban schools: Civil rights, critical race theory, and unexplained realities.|year=2006|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of state funding in U.S education==
Since the early 19th Century policymakers have developed a puta of educational program, each which its own particular structural inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://igr.umich.edu/files/igr/Gurin-EducationandUndersta.pdf|title=Education and Understanding Structural Causes for Group Inequalities|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanisms involved in the allocation of state funding have changed significantly over time. In the past, public schools were primarily funded by property taxes. Funding was supplemented by other state sources. In the early 19th century, policymakers recognized districts relying on property tax could lead to significant disparities in the amount of funding per student.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1602446|title=Equity and Adequacy in School Funding|year=1997|journal=The Future of Children|volume=7|issue=3|pages=63–78|doi=10.2307/1602446}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}}

Thus, policymakers began to analyze the elements of disparity and sought means to address it, numbers of teachers, quality of facilities and materials. To address disparity some states implemented Flat Grants, which typically allocate funding based on the number of teachers. However, this often magnified the disparity, since wealthy communities would have fewer students per teacher.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|64}}

In their attempt to reduce disparity policymakers in 1920 designed what they call the Foundation Program.  The stated purpose was to equalize per-pupil revenue across districts. The goal was achieved by setting a target per-pupil revenue level, and the state supplying funding to equalize revenue in underserved districts. Some analyst characterized the program as a hoax because its structure allowed wealthier districts to exceed the target per-pupil revenue level.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|65}}

Also in order to aid persons with categories of issues, policymakers designed Categorical Programs. The purpose of these programs are to target disparity in poor districts, which do not take into account district wealth. Overtime, policymakers began to allocate funding that takes into consideration pupil needs along with the wealth of the district.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;{{rp|66}}

==Healthcare==

An identified inequality that negatively affects [[Race and health in the United States|health and wellness among minority races]] is highly correlated with income, wealth, social capital, and, indirectly, education.  Researchers have been able to identify significant gaps that exist in mortality rates of African Americans and Caucasian Americans.  There has not been significant changes in the major factors of income, wealth, social capital/psycho-social environment, and socioeconomic status, that positively impact the existing inequality. Studies have noted significant correlations between these factors and major health issues.  For example, poor socioeconomic status is strongly correlated with cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaRocco|first=S.|title=A grounded theory study of socializing men into nursing|journal=Journal of Men's Studies|year=2008|doi=10.3149/jms.1502.120|volume=15|issue=2|pages=120–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social inequalities ==
When discussing the issue of structural inequality we must also consider how hegemonic social structures can support institutional and technological inequalities. In the realm of education studies have suggested that the level of educational attainment for a parent will influence the levels of educational attainment for said parents child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download|title=CiteSeerX — Document Not Found|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The level of education which one receives also tends to be correlated with social capital, income, and criminal activity as well.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lochner |first=Lance |title=Education, Work and Crime: A Human Capital Approach," International Economic Review |year=2004 |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=811–843 |doi=10.1111/j.0020-6598.2004.00288.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings suggest that by simply being the child of someone who is well educated places the child in an advantageous position. This in turn means that the children of new migrants and other groups who have historically been less educated  and have significantly less resources at their disposal will be less likely to achieve higher levels of education.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haveman|first=Robert|last2=Smeeding|first2=Timothy|date=2006|title=The Role of Higher Education in Social Mobility|jstor=3844794|journal=The Future of Children|volume=16|issue=2|pages=125–150|doi=10.1353/foc.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because education plays a role in income, social capital, criminal activity and even the educational attainment of others it becomes possible that a positive feedback loop where the lack of education will perpetuate itself throughout a social class or group.

The outcomes can be highly problematic at the K-12 level as well.  Looking back to school funding we see that when the majority of funding has to come from local school districts and this leads to poorer districts being less adequately funded than wealthier districts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This means that the children who attend these schools which will struggle to provide a quality education with fewer students per teacher, less access to technology and tend to be unable to prepare students for selecting and attending college or university.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  When these students who were unprepared to attend higher education fail to do so they are less likely to encourage their own children to pursue higher education and more likely to be poorer.  Then these individuals will live in traditionally poorer neighborhoods, thus sending their children to underfunded schools ill prepared to gear students towards higher education and further perpetuate a cycle of poor districts and disadvantaged social groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Historical==

The structural inequality of tracking in the educational system is the foundation of the inequalities instituted in other social and organizational structures. Tracking is a term in the educational vernacular that determines where students will be placed during their secondary school years. Traditionally, the most tracked subjects are math and English. Students are categorized into different groups based on their standardized test scores. Tracking is justified by the following four assumptions:

# Students learn better in an academically equal group.
# Positive self-attitudes are developed in homogenous groups, especially for slower students that do not have a high rate of ability differences.
# Fair and accurate group placement is appropriate for future learning based on individual past performance and ability.
# Homogenous groups ease the teaching process.&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt;

[[Race (classification of humans)|Race]], [[ethnicity]], and [[socio-economic class]] limits exposure to advanced academic knowledge thus limiting advanced educational opportunities. A disproportionate number of minority students are placed in low track courses. The content of low track courses are markedly different. Low and average track students typically have limited exposure to "high-status" academic material, thus, the possibility of academic achievement and subsequent success is significantly limited. The tracking phenomenon in schools tends to perpetuate prejudices, misconceptions, and inequalities of the poor and minority people in society.  Schools provide both an education and a setting for students to develop into adults, form future societal roles, and maintain social and organizational structures of society. Tracking in the public educational system parallels the hierarchical social and economic structures in society. Schools have a unique acculturative process that helps to pattern self-perceptions and world views. The expectations of the teachers and information taught differ based on tracks. Thus, dissimilar classroom cultures, different dissemination of knowledge, and unequal education opportunities are created.&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt;

The cycle of  academic tracking and oppression of minority races is dependent on the use of standardized testing. IQ tests are frequently the foundation that determines an individual's group placement. However, accuracy of IQ tests has been found by research to be flawed. Tests, by design, only indicate a student's placement along a high to low continuum and not their actual achievement. The tests have also been found to be culturally biased, therefore, language and experience differences affects test outcomes with lower-class and minority children consistently having lower scores. This leads to inaccurate judgements of students' abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Epstein|first=K.|title=Tests and naked emperors|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=10 December 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized tests were developed by eugenicists to determine who would best fill societal roles and professions. Tests were originally designed to verify the intellectuals of British society. This original intent unconsciously began the sorting dynamic. Tests were used to assist societies to fill important roles. In America, standardized tests were designed to sort students based on responses to test questions that were and are racially biased.  These tests do not factor in the experiential and cultural knowledge or general ability of the students. Students are placed in vocational, general, or academic tracks based on test scores.  Students' futures are determined by tracks and they are viewed and treated differently according to their individual track. Tracks are hierarchical in nature and create, consciously for some and unconsciously for others, the damaging effects of labeling students as fast or slow; bright or special education; average or below average.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sacks|title=Standardized Minds|year=1999|publisher=Perseus Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporate America has an interest in maintaining the use of standardized tests in public school systems thus protecting their potential future workforce that will be derived from the high-tracked, successful high income students by eliminating, through poor academic achievement, a disproportionate number of minority students.  Also, standardized testing is big business. Although it is often argued that standardized testing is an economical method to evaluate students, the real cost is staggering, estimated at $20 billion annually in indirect and direct costs, an amount that does not factor in the social and emotional costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Domhoff|first=G.|title=Who rules America? Power and politics in the year 2000|year=1998|publisher=Mayfield Publishing Company|location=Mountain View}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standardized tests remain a frequently used and expected evaluative method for a variety of reasons. The American culture is interested in intelligence and potential. Standardized testing also provides an economic advantage to some stakeholders, such as prestigious universities, that use standardized test numbers as part of their marketing plan. Finally, standardized testing maintains the status quo of the established social system.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt;

Teacher and counselor judgements have been shown to be just as inaccurate as standardized tests. Teachers and counselors may have a large number of students for which they are responsible for analyzing and making recommendations. Research has found that factors such as appearance, language, behavior, grooming, as well as academic potential, are all considered in the analysis and decision on group placement. This leads to a disproportionate number of lower and minority children placed unfairly into lower track groups.&lt;ref name="Oakes" /&gt;

Teacher diversity is limited by policies that create often-unattainable requirements for bilingual instructors. For example, bilingual instructors may be unable to pass basic educational skills tests because of the inability to write rapidly enough to complete the essay portions of the tests. Limiting resources, in the form of providing primarily English speaking teachers, for bilingual or English as a second language student, limits the learning simply by restricting dissemination of knowledge.  Restructuring the educational system, as well as, encouraging prospective bilingual teachers are two of the ways to ensure diversity among the teaching workforce, increase the distribution of knowledge, and increase the potential and continued academic success of minority students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Epstein|first=K.|title=Insights on Diversity: Toward a representative teaching force|journal=Kappa Delta Pi Record|year=1993|volume=29|issue=4|pages=128|doi=10.1080/00228958.1993.10517960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible solutions to tracking and standardized testing:

*Legal action against standardized test based on discrimination against poor and minority students based on precedent set in the state of Massachusetts.
*Curricula designed as age, culture, and language appropriate.
*Recruit and train a diverse and highly skilled, culturally competent teaching force.
*Elimination of norm-referenced testing.
*Community constructed and culture appropriate assessment tests..
*Explore critical race theory within the educational system to identify how race and racism is a part of the structural inequality of the public school system.
*Create alternative teacher education certification programs that allow teachers to work while earning credentials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9990">In 1995, Jo C. Phelan and Bruce G. Link developed the '''theory of fundamental causes'''.  This theory seeks to outline why the association between [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) and health disparities has persisted over time, particularly when diseases and conditions previously thought to cause [[morbidity]] and mortality among low SES individuals have resolved.&lt;ref name="Phelan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phelan | first1 = JC | last2 = Link | first2 = BG | last3 = Tehranifar | first3 = P | year = 2010 | title = Social conditions as fundamental causes of health inequalities: Theory, evidence, and policy implications | url = | journal = Journal of Health and Social Behavior | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = S28–S40 | doi=10.1177/0022146510383498}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory states that an ongoing association exists between SES and health status because SES "embodies an array of resources, such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that protect health no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any given time."  In other words, despite advances in screening techniques, vaccinations, or any other piece of health technology or knowledge, the underlying fact is that those from low SES communities lack resources to protect and/or improve their health.

== Key components ==
According to Link and Phelan, a fundamental social cause of health inequalities has four key components:
# The cause influences multiple disease outcomes
# The cause affects disease outcomes through multiple [[risk factor]]s.
# The cause involves access to resources that can assist in avoiding health risks or to minimize the [[sequelae]] of disease once it occurs.
# "The association between a fundamental cause and health is reproduced over time via the replacement of intervening mechanisms"&lt;ref name="Phelan" /&gt;

By these criteria, SES is a fundamental cause for healthcare disparities.

==Previous school of thought on health disparities==
In the 19th century, the major causes of mortality were typically infectious diseases, as well as diseases that resulted from poor [[sanitation]] and crowded living conditions.&lt;ref name="Phelan" /&gt; In 1900, the top three causes of death were [[pneumonia]], tuberculosis, and [[diarrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordis, L. Epidemiology, Elsevier-Sanders, Philadelphia, 4th Ed., 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; These conditions have been largely eradicated thanks to the development of [[antibiotic]]s, [[vaccination]]s, [[sewage management]] systems, and improved education regarding sanitation and [[food handling]]. Because lower SES individuals were more likely to live in crowded, unsanitary conditions, it was thought that the improvement of these conditions would lead to an improvement in health. However, disparities in healthcare and health outcomes have persisted.

Health has been linked to social class dating back to the early 19th century, when the French tracked mortality in connection with areas of poverty.  Similarly, the English began documenting mortality by occupation in the mid-1800s.&lt;ref&gt;Elo, I.T. 2009. Social Class Differentials in Health and Mortality: Patterns and Explanations in Comparative Perspective. Annual Review of Sociology. 35:553-572.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, more attention was paid to racial connections to health disparities up until 1973, when [[Evelyn M. Kitagawa]] and [[Philip Hauser]] published a report connecting SES to increased morbidity and mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Kitagawa, E. M., and P. M. Hauser. 1973. Differential  Mortality in the United States: A Study in Socioeconomic Epidemiology.  Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Universitv Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of resources==
Link and Phelan state that the key resources that lower SES individuals lack include knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial social connections.&lt;ref name="Phelan" /&gt;  At a given SES level, this lack of resources persists despite what other factors, beneficial or not so, are at play.

===Knowledge===
Knowledge primarily includes [[health literacy]], but may also involve the knowledge that is gained via access to physicians and the medical establishment.  Health literacy can be defined as "the knowledge and competencies of persons to meet the complex demands of health in society."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2458-12-80.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  While previously health literacy was defined as the ability to read materials in a medical context, the definition has evolved to include more than simply the ability to read.  It now encompasses a broad range of skills and activities that decrease the asymmetry of information in the health care marketplace.

===Money===
The relationship between money and health is linear with a positive slope; that is, the more money a person has, the better their health, with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Herd, P., Goesling, B., and House, J.S. 2007. Socioeconomic Position and Health. American Sociological Association. 48:223-238.&lt;/ref&gt;  At a basic level, income enables people to access and pay for health care when it is necessary or to purchase health insurance.  Beyond this, money also provides the ability to fund healthy choices, including purchasing nutritious food, a [[gym membership]], and medications.  On an even larger scale, it provides the ability to make adaptations to the work or residential environment, e.g., changing jobs, relocating to a safer neighborhood, or retiring from work at the time of one's choosing.  Each of these factors demonstrate that finances play a key role in health decisions and overall health.

===Power and prestige===
In the context of health care and access, power is the ability to exert one's influence to effect change on the behalf of oneself or others.  Prestige is the "reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes."  Power and prestige are factors in determining a person's place in the social hierarchy, and they manifest themselves in multiple ways.&lt;ref&gt;Braveman, P. 2006. Health Disparities and Health Equity: Concepts and Measurement. Annual Review of Public Health. 27:167-194.&lt;/ref&gt; One is power and prestige in the workplace.  Those with power in their jobs are able to take days off of work for leisure or to access medical care.  According to the Whitehall Studies, a gradient was observed across all levels of employment, with those wielding the greatest amount of power in their jobs having the lowest mortality levels.&lt;ref&gt;Marmot, M.G. 1994. Social Differentials in Health within and between Populations. Daedulus. 123:197-216.&lt;/ref&gt;
     
Another example of the use of power and prestige is the ability to exert political power.  Specifically, "electoral engagement is positively correlated with income at the individual level."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cses.org/plancom/2009Toronto/CSES_2009Toronto_JaimeCastillo.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates that those who are of lower socio-economic status are at a disadvantage in terms of the political clout that they possess.  Because lower-income individuals are less likely to vote for representatives and for other ballot measures, the policies and laws put into place may not serve their interests.

===Beneficial social connections===
Social connections can be conceptualized in two ways: one, connections between unrelated social worlds, and, two, social relations within relatively closed worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Bartkus, V.O., Davis, J.H. (2010). Social Capital: Reaching Out, Reaching In. Edward Elgar Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Those of lower SES may lack the first type more than the second, which places them at a more significant disadvantage in terms of their health status.  Someone from a higher-SES group may have friends or colleagues who are health care providers, attorneys, or politicians.  Through these social connections, broader networks can be accessed that may provide health benefits.

Conversely, some lower-SES individuals, specifically [[Latino]]s, benefit from strong community relationships.  This has been referred to as the [[Barrio Effect]], which states that [[Mexican-American]]s living in areas with high densities of Mexicans experience "sociocultural advantages" that "outweigh the disadvantages conferred by the high poverty of those neighborhoods."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eschbach | first1 = K. | last2 = Ostir | first2 = G.V. | last3 = Patel | first3 = K.V. | last4 = Markides | first4 = K.S. | last5 = Goodwin | first5 =  | date = Oct 2004 | title = Neighborhood Context and Mortality among older Mexican American: Is there a Barrio Advantage? | url = | journal = Am J Public Health | volume = 94 | issue = 10| pages = 1807–12 | pmid = 15451754 | pmc=1448538 | doi=10.2105/ajph.94.10.1807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intervening mechanisms==
A final key part of the theory is the persistence of resource disparities that perpetuate unequal health outcomes, despite intervening mechanisms that may otherwise appear to improve health status.  An example of this is the [[Pap smear]] for [[cervical cancer screening]].  Since the development of the Pap smear in the 1940s, a disparity has existed in utilization of this screening test given differences in resources mentioned above.&lt;ref name="Phelan" /&gt;  Another example is the [[polio vaccine]].  Prior to the vaccine, polio could afflict people of all socioeconomic classes.  Once the vaccine became available, it was primarily accessible by those who possessed the resources to obtain it.  We also see an example of  this in colorectal cancer, in which the variable diffusion has role in the theory; in which diffusion has reduced mortality, but not enough to eliminiate SES inequalities as seen in Wang et al. 2012.

These examples demonstrate how intervening mechanisms, e.g., the Pap smear and the polio vaccine, did not decrease health disparities given that certain groups possessed resources to access them and others did not.

This '''timeline of events leading up to the [[American Civil War]]''' describes and links to narrative articles and references about many of the events and issues which historians recognize as [[Origins of the American Civil War|origins and causes of the Civil War]]. The pre-Civil War events can be roughly divided into a period encompassing the long-term build-up over many decades and a period encompassing the five-month build-up to war immediately after the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] as [[President of the United States|President]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1860|Election of 1860]], which culminated in the [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fall of Fort Sumter]] (April 1861).

Since the early [[Colony of Virginia|colonial period in Virginia]], [[slavery]] had been a part of the socioeconomic system of British North America and was recognized in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] at the time of the [[United States]]' [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (1776). Since then, events and statements by politicians and others brought forth differences, tensions and divisions between the people of the [[slave states]] of the [[Southern United States]] and the people of the [[Free state (United States)|free states]] of the [[Northern United States]] (including Western states) over the topics of slavery. The large underlying issue from which other issues developed was whether slavery should be retained and even expanded to other areas or whether it should be contained and eventually abolished. Over many decades, these issues and divisions became increasingly irreconcilable and contentious.&lt;ref&gt;James M. McPherson, ''Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era'' (1988), ch. 1–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Events in the 1850s culminated with the election of the anti-slavery-expansion Republican Abraham Lincoln as President on November 6, 1860. This provoked the first round of state secessions as leaders of the Deep South cotton states were unwilling to remain in a second class political status with their way of life threatened by the President himself. Initially, the seven Deep South states seceded, with economies based on [[cotton]] (then in heavy European demand with rising prices). They were Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas. After the Confederates attacked and captured Fort Sumter, President Lincoln called for volunteers to march south and suppress the rebellion. This pushed the four other Upper South States (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) also to secede. These states completed the formation of the [[Confederate States of America]]. Their addition to the Confederacy ensured a war would be prolonged and bloody because they contributed territory and soldiers.

* July 13: The Continental Congress under the [[Articles of Confederation]] passes the [[Northwest Ordinance]] to govern territory north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of Pennsylvania.

In the ordinance, Congress prohibits slavery and involuntary servitude in the territory and requires the return of [[fugitive slaves]] found in the territory to their owners. The law no longer applies as soon as the territories become states.  Anti-slavery Northerners cite the ordinance many times over the years as precedent for the limitation, if not the abolition, of slavery in the United States.

Douglas of Illinois proposes the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act|Kansas–Nebraska Bill]] to open good Midwestern farmland to settlement and to encourage building of a transcontinental railroad with a terminus at Chicago. Whether slavery would be permitted in a territory would be determined by a vote of the people at the time a territory is organized.&lt;ref name="Eicher44"&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein47"&gt;Klein, 1997, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman37"&gt;Bowman, 1982, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen23"&gt;Hansen, 1861, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Congress enacts the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], providing that popular sovereignty, a vote of the people when a territory is organized, will decide "all questions pertaining to slavery" in the Kansas–Nebraska territories. This abrogates the Missouri Compromise prohibition of slavery north of the 36°30' line of latitude and increases Northerners' fears of a [[Slave Power]] encroaching on the North.&lt;ref name="Hansen23" /&gt; Both Northerners and Southerners rush to the [[Kansas Territory|Kansas]] and Nebraska territories to express their opinion in the voting. Especially in Kansas, many voters are pro-slavery Missouri residents who enter Kansas simply to vote.&lt;ref name="Bowman37" /&gt;
* Opponents of slavery and the Kansas–Nebraska Act meet in [[Ripon, Wisconsin]] in February, and subsequently meet in other Northern states, to form the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name="Bowman37" /&gt; The party includes many former members of the Whig and Free Soil parties and some northern Democrats. Republicans win most of the Northern state seats in the U.S. House of Representatives in the fall 1854 elections as 66 of 91 Northern state Democrats are defeated. [[Abraham Lincoln]] emerges as a Republican leader in the West (Illinois).&lt;ref name="Wagner63" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein47" /&gt;
* [[Eli Thayer]] forms the [[New England Emigrant Aid Society]] to encourage settlement of Kansas by persons opposed to slavery.&lt;ref name="Wagner63" /&gt;
* Bitter fighting breaks out in Kansas Territory as pro-slavery men win a majority of seats in the legislature, expel anti-slavery legislators and adopt the pro-slavery [[Lecompton Constitution]] for the proposed state of Kansas.&lt;ref name="Bowman37" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansen23" /&gt;
* The [[Ostend Manifesto]], a dispatch sent from France by the U.S. ministers to Britain, France and Spain after a meeting in Ostend, Belgium, describes the rationale for the United States to purchase Cuba (a territory which had slavery) from Spain and implies the U.S. should declare war if Spain refuses to sell the island. Four months after the dispatch is drafted, it is published in full at the request of the U.S. House of Representatives. Northern states view the document as a Southern attempt to extend slavery. European nations consider it as a threat to Spain and to Imperial power. The U.S. government never acts upon the recommendations in the Ostend Manifesto.&lt;ref name="McPherson72" /&gt;
* [[Anthony Burns]], a fugitive slave from Virginia, is arrested by federal agents in [[Boston]]. Radical abolitionists attack the court house and kill a deputy marshal in an unsuccessful attempt to free Burns.&lt;ref name="Wagner63" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 1982, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Abolitionist editor [[Sherman Booth]] was arrested for violating the Fugitive Slave Act when he helped incite a mob to rescue an escaped slave, [[Joshua Glover]], in Wisconsin from [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Stephen V. R. Ableman.&lt;ref&gt;[[David M. Potter|Potter, David M.]] completed and edited by [[Don E. Fehrenbacher]] ''The Impending Crisis: America Before the Civil War, 1848–1861'' (1976), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Knights of the Golden Circle]], a fraternal organization that wants to expand slavery to Mexico, [[Central America]], the [[Caribbean Islands]], including Cuba, and northern [[South America]], is founded in Louisville, Kentucky.&lt;ref name="McPherson72" /&gt;
* Former Mississippi Governor [[John A. Quitman]] begins to raise money and volunteers to invade Cuba, but is slow to act and cancels the invasion plan in spring 1855 when President Pierce says he would enforce the neutrality laws.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 1982, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Know-Nothing Party]] or American Party, which includes many [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] former Whigs, sweeps state and local elections in parts of some Northern states. The party demands ethnic purification, opposes Catholics (because of the presumed power of the Pope over them), and opposes corruption in local politics. The party soon fades away.&lt;ref name="Wagner63" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein47" /&gt;
* [[George Fitzhugh]]'s pro-slavery ''Sociology for the South'' is published.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 1982, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Violence by pro-slavery looters from Missouri known as [[Border Ruffians]] and anti-slavery groups known as [[Jayhawkers]] breaks out in "[[Bleeding Kansas]]" as pro-slavery and anti-slavery supporters try to organize the territory as slave or free. Many Ruffians vote illegally in Kansas. Estimates will show that the violence in Kansas resulted in about 200 persons killed and $2 million worth of property destroyed during the middle and late 1850s. Over 95 percent of the pro-slavery votes in the election of a Kansas territorial legislature in 1855 were later determined to be fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 1982, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-slavery Kansans draft an anti-slavery constitution, the [[Topeka Constitution]], and elect a new legislature, which actually represent the majority of legal voters. Meanwhile, the initial fraudulently elected but legal Kansas legislature still exists.&lt;ref name="Bowman38"&gt;Bowman, 1982, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

* May 22: Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of South Carolina [[Caning of Charles Sumner|beats with a cane]] and incapacitates Senator [[Charles Sumner]] of Massachusetts on the floor of the U.S. Senate. In a speech in the Senate chamber, ''The Crime Against Kansas'', Sumner ridicules slaveowners—especially Brooks's cousin, U.S. Senator [[Andrew Butler]] of South Carolina—as in love with a prostitute (slavery) and raping the virgin Kansas. Brooks is a hero in the South, Sumner a martyr in the North.&lt;ref&gt;Williamjames Hoffer, ''The Caning of Charles Sumner: Honor, Idealism, and the Origins of the Civil War'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 1856 U.S. [[U.S. presidential election, 1856|presidential election]] Republican [[John C. Frémont]] crusades against slavery. The Republican slogan is "Free speech, free press, free soil, free men, Frémont and victory!" [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] counter that Fremont's election could lead to civil war. The Democratic Party candidate, [[James Buchanan]], who carries five northern and western states and all the southern states except Maryland, wins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven E.

* [[Thomas Prentice Kettell]], a New York Democrat, writes ''Southern Wealth and Northern Profits'', a lengthy statistical pamphlet about the economies of the Northern and Southern regions of the country. The book receives wide acclaim among secessionists in the South and much derision from anti-slavery politicians in the North, even though some historians think Kettell intended it as an argument that the two regions are economically dependent upon each other.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, 1947, pp. 470–471.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Filibusterer William Walker, in alliance with local rebels, overthrows the government of [[Nicaragua]] and proclaims himself president. He decrees the reintroduction of slavery.

* [[Hinton Rowan Helper]], a North Carolinian, publishes ''[[The Impending Crisis of the South]]'', which argues that slavery was the main cause of the South's economic stagnation.

* The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] reaches the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' decision, a 7 to 2 ruling that Congress lacks the power to exclude slavery from the territories, that slaves are property and have no rights as citizens and that slaves are not made free by living in free territory. Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] concludes that the Missouri Compromise is unconstitutional. If a court majority clearly agreed (which it did not in this decision), this conclusion would allow all territories to be open to slavery.  Scott and his family were purchased and freed by a supporter's children. Northerners vowed to oppose the decision as in violation of a "higher law". Antagonism between the sections of the country increases.&lt;ref&gt;Don E. Fehrenbacher, ''Slavery, Law, and Politics: The Dred Scott Case in Historical Perspective'' (1981).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anti-slavery supporters in Kansas ignore a June election to a constitutional convention because less populous pro-slavery counties were given a majority of delegates. The convention adopts the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution. Meanwhile, anti-slavery representatives win control of the state legislature.&lt;ref name="Wagner, 2009, p. 64"&gt;Wagner, 2009, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein53"&gt;Klein, 1997, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August, a short economic depression, the [[Panic of 1857]], arises, mainly in large northern cities, as a result of speculation in and inflated values of railroad stocks and real estate. Southerners tout the small effect in their section as support for their economic and labor system.&lt;ref name="Klein53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wagner65"&gt;Wagner, 2009, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Buchanan endorses the Lecompton constitution and breaks with Douglas, who regards the document as a mockery of popular sovereignty because its referendum provision does not offer a true free state option. A bitter feud begins inside the Democratic party. Douglas's opposition to the Lecompton constitution erodes his support from pro-slavery factions.&lt;ref name="McPherson, 1982, p. 108"&gt;McPherson, 1982, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Lincoln-Douglas Debates of 1858]] focus on issues and arguments that will dominate the [[Presidential election of 1860|Presidential election campaign of 1860]]. Pro-Douglas candidates win a small majority in the Illinois legislature in the general election and choose Douglas as U.S. Senator from Illinois for another term. However, Lincoln emerges as a nationally known moderate spokesman for Republicans and a moderate opponent of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;Allen C. Guelzo, ''Lincoln and Douglas: The debates that defined America'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a debate with Lincoln at [[Freeport, Illinois]], Douglas expresses an opinion which becomes known as the "[[Freeport Doctrine]]". Lincoln asks whether the people of a territory could lawfully exclude slavery before the territory became a state. In effect, this question asks Douglas to reconcile popular sovereignty with the ''Dred Scott'' decision. Douglas says they could do so by refusing to pass the type of police regulations needed to sustain slavery. This answer further alienates pro-slavery advocates from Douglas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rodriguez|title=Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4X44KbDBl9gC&amp;pg=RA1-PA300|year=2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cotton is King; until lately the Bank of England was king; but she tried to put her screws, as usual...on the cotton crop, and was utterly vanquished", which seemingly means that even Europe was dependent on the cotton economy of the Southern states and would have to intervene in any U.S. conflict, even an internal threat, to protect its source of vital raw material, [[King Cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Drew Gilpin Faust, ''James Henry Hammond and the old South: A design for mastery'' (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

* In February, U.S. Senator [[Albert G. Brown]] of Mississippi says that if a territory requires a slave code in line with Douglas's Freeport Doctrine, the federal government must pass a slave code to protect slavery in the territories. If it does not, Brown says he will urge Mississippi to secede from the union.&lt;ref name="McPherson, 1982, p. 108" /&gt;

* On October 16, Kansas abolitionist John Brown attempts to spark a slave rebellion in Virginia through seizure of weapons from the federal [[Harpers Ferry Armory|armory]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]].&lt;ref name="Bowman39" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eicher45"&gt;Eicher, 2001, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown holds the arsenal for 36 hours. No slaves join him and no rebellion ensues but seventeen persons, including 10 of Brown's men, are killed. Brown and his remaining men are captured by U.S. Marines led by Army Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert E. Lee]].&lt;ref name="Eicher45" /&gt; Brown is tried for [[treason]] to the state of Virginia, found guilty and hanged on December 2 in [[Charles Town, Virginia]] (now [[Charlestown, West Virginia]]).&lt;ref name="Eicher45" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, 1982, pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown becomes a martyr to the North, but alarms the South as an example of a fanatical Yankee abolitionist trying to start a bloody race war.&lt;ref name="Bowman39" /&gt; Secession sentiment grows in the South in response to Northern sympathy for Brown.&lt;ref name="Wagner, 2009, p. 66"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein58"&gt;Klein, 1997, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 1961, p. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McPherson115117"&gt;McPherson, 1982, pp. 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath 1861: Further secessions and divisions==
; Additional events related to secession and initiation of the war follow; most other events after April 15 are not listed.

Several small skirmishes and battles as well as bloody riots in St. Louis and Baltimore took place in the early months of the war. The [[Battle of First Bull Run]] or Battle of First Manassas, the first major battle of the war, occurred on July 21, 1861. After that, it became clear that there could be no compromise between the Union and the seceding states and that a long and bloody war could not be avoided. All hope of a settlement short of a catastrophic war was lost.
