[[File:A369_at_Easton_in_Gordano.jpg|thumb|The A369 road and M5 motorway near Easton in Gordano, Bristol]]
The '''A369''' is an [[A roads in Great Britain|A road]] running from [[Ashton Gate, Bristol|Ashton Gate]] junction with the [[A370 road|A370]] and the [[A3029 road|A3029]] to [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]] in [[South West England]]. The first part is relatively flat and the route passes through several villages which are [[Leigh Woods]], [[Abbots Leigh]], [[Easton in Gordano]] to [[Portishead, Somerset|Portishead]]. The road crosses the [[M5 motorway]] at Junction 19 which is where the single complex [[Gordano services]] are located.&lt;ref name="A369 road"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=A369|title=A369 route|publisher=Sabre Roads|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the [[rush hour]] period the road gets extremely busy since it is the main commuter route from Portishead to Bristol. There is lots of congestion on the A369 which is why one of the primary reasons for reopening the [[Portishead Railway|Portishead Branch Line]].&lt;ref name="prgcase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portisheadrailwaygroup.org/ourcase.html|title=Our Case for the Railway|author=[[Portishead Railway Group]]|date=2015|accessdate=28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1922, the A369 was originally connected from [[Ashcott]] to [[Marksbury]]. By 1935 however, the road and became part of the [[A39 road|A39]], eventually the roads number became unused for many decades.&lt;ref name="A369 road" /&gt;

By the 1950s, it was thought that Portishead was a connection to the A-road but it was connected to the [[B3124 road|B3124]] and eventually it became part of the A369. The road crossed over the [[Clifton Suspension Bridge]] where soon after however, it was re-routed over the [[B3126 road|B3126]] and connected to the [[A370 road|A370]].&lt;ref name="A369 road" /&gt;

In the early 1970s, the [[M5 motorway|M5]] was completed from the [[Avonmouth Bridge]] and went southwards, the western half of the route became part of the Gordano Interchange. Eventually a new route was completed from the village of [[Portbury]] into Portishead, and the old road through [[Sheepway]] was separated by the M5 motorway so a new road called [[Wyndham Way, Bristol|Wyndham Way]] was constructed to allow faster access to the Town Centre, [[Bristol Docks]] and [[Power station|Power Station]]. &lt;ref name="A369 road" /&gt;

'''''About Time''''' ({{ISBN|978-0-684-81822-1}}), published in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Nonfiction Book Review: About Time by Paul Davies| work = Publishers Weekly| accessdate = 2017-10-31| url =https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-671-79964-9|date=27 February 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the second [[book]] written by [[Paul Davies]], regarding the subject of [[time]]. The intended audience is the general public, rather than science academics.

''About Time'' explores selected mysteries of [[spacetime]], following on from [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]], which Davies believes does not fully explain time as humans experience it. The author explains &lt;blockquote&gt;
Important though Einstein's time turned out to be, it still did not solve "the riddle of time".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The book delves into the nature of [[metaphysics]], time, motion and [[gravity]], covering a wide range of aspects surrounding the current [[cosmological]] [[debate]], across 283 pages in great detail. It includes an [[Index (publishing)|index]], a [[bibliography]], and numerous [[diagram]]s.

{| class="wikitable" style="float:right"
|+Additive utility
|-
! &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;u(A)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; || 0

|}
Additivity (also called ''linearity'' or ''modularity'') means that "the whole is equal to the sum of its parts." That is, the utility of a set of items is the sum of the utilities of each item separately. Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set of items. A cardinal utility function &lt;math&gt;u:2^S\to\R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;2^S&lt;/math&gt; is the [[power set]] of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, is additive if for any &lt;math&gt;A, B\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;u(A)+u(B)=u(A\cup B)-u(A\cap B).&lt;/math&gt;
It follows that for any &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq S&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;u(A)=u(\emptyset)+\sum_{x\in A}\big(u(\{x\})-u(\emptyset)\big).&lt;/math&gt;
An additive utility function is characteristic of [[independent goods]]. For example, an apple and a hat are considered independent: the utility a person receives from having an apple is the same whether or not he has a hat, and vice versa. A typical utility function for this case is given at the right.

== Notes ==
* As mentioned above, additivity is a property of cardinal utility functions. An analogous property of [[ordinal utility]] functions is [[weakly additive]].
* A utility function is additive [[if and only if]] it is both [[Submodular_set_function|submodular]] and [[Supermodular_function#Supermodular_functions_of_subsets|supermodular]].

A '''bahuvrihi compound''' (from {{lang-sa|बहुव्रीहि|tr=bahuvrīhi}}, literally meaning "much rice" but denoting a rich man) is a type of [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] that denotes a referent by specifying a certain characteristic or quality the referent possesses. A bahuvrihi is [[exocentric]], so that the compound is not a [[hyponym]] of its [[Head (linguistics)|head]]. For instance, a [[saber-toothed cat|sabretooth]] (''[[smilodon|smil-odon]]'') is neither a [[sabre]] nor a [[tooth]], but a feline with sabre-like teeth.  

In Sanskrit bahuvrihis, the last constituent is a noun—more strictly, a nominal [[stem (linguistics)|stem]]—while the whole compound is an adjective. In [[Vedic Sanskrit]] the [[Vedic accent|accent]] is regularly on the first member ({{lang|sa-Latn|[[tatpurusha]]}} ''{{lang|sa-Latn|rāja-pútra}}'' "a king's son", but bahuvrihi ''{{lang|sa-Latn|rājá-putra}}'' "having kings as sons", viz. ''{{lang|sa-Latn|rājá-putra-}}'', m., "father of kings", ''{{lang|sa-Latn|rājá-putrā-}}'', f., "mother of kings"), with the exception of a number of non-nominal prefixes such as the [[privative a]]; the word ''{{lang|sa-Latn|bahuvrīhí}}'' is itself likewise an exception to this rule.

In English bahuvrihis can be identified and the last constituent is usually a noun, while the whole compound is a noun or an adjective. The accent is on the first constituent. English bahuvrihis often describe people using [[synecdoche]]: ''flatfoot'', ''half-wit'', ''highbrow'', ''lowlife'', ''redhead'', ''tenderfoot'', ''long-legs'', and ''white-collar''.

==English examples==
* "[[Houndstooth]]", a woven fabric with a patterns resembling dog's teeth: "She's wearing houndstooth."
* "[[Old money]]", members from established upper-class who have usually inherited their wealth: "He's definitely old money."
* "[[Bluestocking]]", an educated, intellectual, or artistically accomplished woman: "Auntie Maud will never marry; she's a bluestocking."

===Non-English examples===
*{{lang|non|[[Skinfaxi]]|italic=no}} and {{lang|non|[[Hrímfaxi]]|italic=no}} (meaning ''shining-mane'' and ''rime-mane''; two horses in [[Norse mythology]]) are two examples of [[Old Norse]] bahuvrihis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2460">'''Chartered Scientist''' (CSci) is a [[professional certification|professional qualification]] in the [[United Kingdom]] that is awarded by the [[Science Council]] through its Licensed member organisations. Holders of this qualification can use the post-nominal letters CSci.

Chartered scientists are professional scientists who are practising and/or advancing science at the full professional level and are individuals for whom scientific knowledge or practice at that level form an essential element of their role.
The required standard&lt;ref&gt;Standards section of Chartered Scientist website http://www.charteredscientist.org/about/standards.html&lt;/ref&gt; for Chartered Scientist registration is a Masters-level science qualification (or equivalent) with four years of postgraduate work experience.

The standards of the Chartered Scientist designation are upheld by the Science Council’s Registration Authority, whose members are elected representatives from the Licensed Bodies and appointed experts from other areas.
==Chartered Science Teacher==
There is a specialist section of the register for scientists whose primary profession is teaching.  Those registered are entitled to use the post-nominal '''CSciTeach'''.  It was developed in 2007 by the Science Council in partnership with the [[Association for Science Education]], and is also awarded by the [[Royal Society of Biology]] and the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]].&lt;ref name=CSciTeach&gt;[http://www.charteredscientist.org/sites/default/files/attachment/CSciTeach%20brochure.pdf www.charteredscientist.org] SSciTeach Brochure&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eic&gt;''Education in Chemistry'', March 2014 p3 "RSC to award CSciTeach"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genome==
The [[genome]] is ~2.6 kilobases in length and encodes two [[open reading frame]]s (ORFs). The larger of the ORFs encodes the replicase gene and the other the putative capsid protein. A [[stem-loop]] and [[TATA box]]es are present in the non coding parts of the sequence.

==Taxonomy==
This virus appears to be related to the [[bovine stool associated circular virus]] but to no other known group of viruses.

In [[statistics]], '''completeness''' is a property of a [[statistic]] in relation to a model for a set of observed data. In essence, it ensures that the distributions corresponding to different values of the parameters are distinct.

It is closely related to the idea of [[identifiability]], but in [[statistical theory]] it is often found as a condition imposed on  a [[sufficient statistic]] from which certain optimality results are derived.

==Definition==
Consider a [[random variable]] ''X'' whose probability distribution belongs to a [[parametric model]]  '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; parametrized by&amp;nbsp;''θ''.

Say ''T'' is [[statistic]]; that is, the composition of a [[measurable function]] with a random sample ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.

The statistic ''T'' is said to be '''complete''' for the distribution of ''X'' if, for every measurable function ''g,''&lt;ref&gt;Young, G. A. and Smith, R. L. (2005). Essentials of Statistical Inference. (p. 94). Cambridge University  Press.&lt;/ref&gt;: 

&lt;math&gt;\text{if }\operatorname{E}_\theta(g(T))=0\text{ for all }\theta\text{ then }\mathbf{P}_\theta(g(T)=0)=1\text{ for all }\theta.&lt;/math&gt;

The statistic ''T''  is said to be '''boundedly complete''' for the distribution of ''X'' if this implication holds for every measurable function ''g'' that is also bounded.

=== Example 1: Bernoulli model ===
The Bernoulli model admits a complete statistic.&lt;ref&gt;Casella, G. and Berger, R. L. (2001). Statistical Inference. (pp. 285–286). Duxbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''X'' be a [[random sample]] of size ''n'' such that each ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; has the same [[Bernoulli distribution]] with parameter ''p''. Let ''T'' be the number of 1s observed in the sample. ''T'' is a statistic of ''X'' which has  a [[binomial distribution]] with parameters (''n'',''p''). If the parameter space for ''p'' is (0,1), then ''T'' is a complete statistic. To see this, note that

:&lt;math&gt; \operatorname{E}_p(g(T)) = \sum_{t=0}^n {g(t){n \choose t}p^{t}(1-p)^{n-t}} = (1-p)^n \sum_{t=0}^n {g(t){n \choose t}\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)^t} .&lt;/math&gt;

Observe also that neither ''p'' nor 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'' can be 0. Hence &lt;math&gt;E_p(g(T)) = 0&lt;/math&gt; if and only if:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=0}^n g(t){n \choose t}\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right)^t = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

On denoting ''p''/(1&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''p'') by ''r'', one gets:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{t=0}^n g(t){n \choose t}r^t = 0 .&lt;/math&gt;

First, observe that the range of ''r'' is the [[positive reals]]. Also, E(''g''(''T'')) is a [[polynomial]] in ''r'' and, therefore, can only be identical to 0 if all coefficients are 0, that is, ''g''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for all&amp;nbsp;''t''.

It is important to notice that the result that all coefficients must be 0 was obtained because of the range of ''r''. Had the parameter space been finite and with a number of elements less than or equal to ''n'', it might be possible to solve the linear equations in ''g''(''t'') obtained by substituting the values of ''r'' and get solutions different from 0. For example, if ''n'' = 1 and the parameter space is {0.5}, a single observation and a single parameter value, ''T'' is not complete. Observe that, with the definition:

:&lt;math&gt; g(t) = 2(t-0.5), \, &lt;/math&gt;

then, E(''g''(''T'')) = 0 although ''g''(''t'') is not 0 for ''t'' = 0 nor for ''t'' = 1.

=== Example 2: Sum of normals ===
This example will show that, in a sample ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of size 2 from a [[normal distribution]] with known variance, the statistic ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is complete and sufficient. Suppose (''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are [[statistical independence|independent]], identically distributed random variables, [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with expectation ''θ'' and variance 1.
The sum

:&lt;math&gt;s((X_1, X_2)) = X_1 + X_2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

is a '''complete statistic''' for ''θ''.

To show this, it is sufficient to demonstrate that there is no non-zero function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; such that the expectation of

:&lt;math&gt;g(s(X_1, X_2)) = g(X_1+X_2)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

remains zero regardless of the value of ''θ''.

That fact may be seen as follows.  The probability distribution of ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is normal with expectation 2''θ'' and variance 2.  Its probability density function in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is therefore proportional to

:&lt;math&gt;\exp\left(-(x-2\theta)^2/4\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation of ''g'' above would therefore be a constant times

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty g(x)\exp\left(-(x-2\theta)^2/4\right)\,dx.&lt;/math&gt;

A bit of algebra reduces this to

:&lt;math&gt;k(\theta) \int_{-\infty}^\infty h(x)e^{x\theta}\,dx\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k''(''θ'') is nowhere zero and

:&lt;math&gt;h(x)=g(x)e^{-x^2/4}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

As a function of ''θ'' this is a two-sided [[Laplace transform]] of ''h''(''X''), and cannot be identically zero unless ''h''(''x'') is zero almost everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Orloff|first=Jeremy|title=Uniqueness of Laplace Transform|url=http://web.mit.edu/jorloff/www/18.03-esg/notes/extra/laplaceuniqueness.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The exponential is not zero, so this can only happen if ''g''(''x'') is zero almost everywhere.

==Relation to sufficient statistics==
For some parametric families, a complete [[sufficient statistic]] does not exist (for example, see Galili and Meilijson 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An Example of an Improvable Rao–Blackwell Improvement, Inefficient Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and Unbiased Generalized Bayes Estimator | authors = Tal Galili &amp; Isaac Meilijson | date = 31 Mar 2016 | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683?journalCode=utas20 | pages = 108–113 |doi=10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683| pmc = 4960505 | pmid=27499547}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Also, a [[minimal sufficient]] statistic need not exist. (A case in which there is no minimal sufficient statistic was shown by [[R. R. Bahadur|Bahadur]] in 1957. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}) Under mild conditions, a minimal sufficient statistic does always exist. In particular, these conditions always hold if the random variables (associated with '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt; ) are all discrete or are all continuous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Importance of completeness==
The notion of completeness has many applications in statistics, particularly in the following two theorems of mathematical statistics.

===Lehmann–Scheffé theorem===
'''Completeness''' occurs in the [[Lehmann–Scheffé theorem]],&lt;ref name="CB2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casella|first1=George|last2=Berger|first2=Roger L.|title=Statistical Inference|date=2001|publisher=Duxbury Press|isbn=978-0534243128|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which states that if a statistic that is unbiased, '''complete''' and [[sufficiency (statistics)|sufficient]] for some parameter ''θ'', then it is the best mean-unbiased estimator for&amp;nbsp;''θ''. In other words, this statistic has a smaller expected loss for any [[convex function|convex]] loss function; in many practical applications with the squared loss-function, it has a smaller mean squared error among any estimators with the same [[expected value]].

Examples exists that when the minimal sufficient statistic is '''not complete''' then several alternative statistics exist for unbiased estimation of ''θ'', while some of them have lower variance than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= An Example of an Improvable Rao–Blackwell Improvement, Inefficient Maximum Likelihood Estimator, and Unbiased Generalized Bayes Estimator | authors = Tal Galili &amp; Isaac Meilijson | date = 31 Mar 2016 | journal = The American Statistician | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683?journalCode=utas20 | pages = 108–113 |doi=10.1080/00031305.2015.1100683| pmc = 4960505 | pmid=27499547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[minimum-variance unbiased estimator]].

===Basu's theorem===
'''Bounded completeness''' occurs in [[Basu's theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;Casella, G. and Berger, R. L. (2001). Statistical Inference. (pp. 287). Duxbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which states that a statistic that is both '''boundedly complete'''  and [[Sufficient statistic|sufficient]] is [[statistical independence|independent]] of any [[ancillary statistic]].

===Bahadur's theorem===

'''Bounded completeness''' also occurs in [[Bahadur's theorem]]. In the case where there exists at least one [[minimal sufficient]] statistic, a statistic which is [[sufficient]] and boundedly complete, is necessarily minimal sufficient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11255">'''Dendroarchaeology''' is a term used for the study of vegetation remains, old buildings, [[artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, furniture, art and musical instruments using the techniques of [[dendrochronology]] ([[tree]]-ring dating). It refers to dendrochronological research of wood from the past regardless of its current physical context (in or above the soil). This form of dating is the most accurate and precise absolute dating method available to archaeologists, as the last ring that grew is the first year the tree could have been incorporated into an archaeological structure.&lt;ref name=Feder&gt;Feder K. Linking to the Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Tree-ring dating is useful in that it can contribute to "chronometric", "environmental", and "behavioral" archaeological research.&lt;ref name="Nash S. E."&gt;Nash S. E. Archaeological Tree-Ring Dating at the Millennium. ''Journal of Archaeological Research'', Vol. 10, No. 3 (September 2002), pp. 243-275&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility of tree-ring dating in an environmental sense  is the most applicable of the three in today's world. Tree rings can be used to "reconstruct numerous environmental variables" such as "temperature", "precipitation", "stream flow", "drought society", "fire frequency and intensity", "insect infestation", "atmospheric circulation patterns", among others.&lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

==History==
Tree ring laboratory scientists from Columbia University were some of the first to apply tree-ring dating to the colonial period, specifically architectural timbers in the eastern United States. For agencies like the National Park Service and other historical societies, Dr. Jacoby and Cook began dating historic structures in the lower Hudson River Valley, New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania. This was difficult at the time due to a lack of sufficiently long master dating chronology and access to suitable structures. Not until 1998 was a Boston area master dating chronology developed.
Today, the effectiveness of tree ring laboratory archaeological dating chronologies covers most of the area that was settled by the first European colonists. The numbers of these are in the hundreds and include historically significant structures such as Independence Hall and the Tuckahoe estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/tree-ring-laboratory/tree-ring-research/dendroarchaeology |title=Dendroarchaeology |year = 2012 | accessdate=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
There are two types of dates that can be assigned to tree specimens: ''cutting'' dates, and ''noncutting'' dates. Which date is assigned to a specimen is dependent on whether or not there is evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring the tree grew before it died.&lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

''Cutting dates'' can be used for crossdated tree specimens that "possess evidence that the last ring present on the specimen was the last ring grown by the tree before it died." &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

''Noncutting dates'' are used for crossdated tree specimens "if there is no evidence indicating that the last ring present on the specimen is the last one grown before the tree died." &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;
Patterns of tree growth will be similar between trees of the same species, growing in the same climate. These matching patterns align growth rings in different trees formed in the same year.  Once aligned, knowing the precise calendar year of any individual tree-ring is the same as knowing the calendar year of all the rings.  The goal of a dendroarchaeologist is to determine the year when the last ring was formed. 
Crossdating, the skill of finding matching ring-width patterns between tree-ring samples, is used to assign the precise calendar year to every ring. This is affected by the climate that the timber was in. It is also important to have enough rings to actually confirm a date. Once the rings are dates, the chronology is measured. The last step is to compare the rings with that of ring-width patterns in sampled timbers and a master dating chronology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/tree-ring-laboratory/tree-ring-research/dendroarchaeology/methodology|title=Scientific Application |year = 2012 | accessdate=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For trees to be useful in archaeological analysis, they must "produce annual growth rings that are uniform around the tree stem", they must "live for decades and, preferably, centuries" and they "must have been used extensively by humans either for habitation or fuel." &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt; One of the problems with this evaluation is that it is possible under certain conditions for a tree to miss a growth-ring or produce two growth rings in a season. During extreme drought there can be insufficient growth of xylem to form a noticeable ring. Alternatively, if a defoliating agent (e.g. drought, late frost, or insect damage) can arrest the growth of a tree early in a year, after which there is a secondary growth period of new foliage causing two rings to form.&lt;ref name=Baillie&gt;{{cite book|last=Baillie|first=M.G.L.|title=Tree-Ring Dating and Archaeology|year=1982|publisher=Croom Helm Ltd|location=London|isbn=0-7099-0613-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another difficulty in the use of tree-ring dating as applied to archaeology is the variety and condition of wood used in construction of archaeological sites. Many such samples are encountered wet. Heartwood can normally retain much of its substance and can be dried out and polished for analysis. On the other hand, ancient wet sapwood samples seldom survive drying out. As a result, the sapwood should either be measured wet and then allowed to dry, or it should be frozen or kept wet.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt;

In North America, "millennial-length chronologies have been developed for two species of bristlecone pine (''Pinus longaeva'' in the Great Basin and ''Pinus aristata'' in the Rocky Mountains), bald cypress (''Taxodium distichum''), coast redwood (''Sequoia sempervirens''), Douglas-fir (''Pseudotsuga menziesii''), eastern cedar (''Juniperus virginiana''), juniper (''Juniperus sp.''), Larch (''Larix sp.''), lodgepole pine (''Pinus contorta''), limber pine (''Pinus flexilis''), mountain hemlock (''Tsuga mertensiana''), ponderosa pine (''Pinus ponderosa''), and giant sequoia (''Sequoiadendron giganteum'') (Jacoby, 2000a).” &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

“In the southern hemisphere, successful crossdating has been achieved on alerce (''Fitroya cupressoides'') and pehuen (''Araucaria araucana''), also known as 'Chilean pine' or the 'monkey puzzle tree,' specimens in South America, kauri (''Agathis australis'') specimens in New Zealand, clanwilliam cedar (''Widdringtonia cedarbergensis'') specimens in Australia and Tasmania, and huon pine (''Lagarostrobus franklinii'') in Tasmania (Jacoby, 2000al; Norton, 1990).” &lt;ref name="Nash S. E."/&gt;

==Application==
The main application of tree research laboratory science or dendroarchaeology is to produce records of past climates that might be unavailable otherwise.  Timber remains give insight into what little remains of our national forests prior to colonial settlement. This also benefits the sciences of paleoclimatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/tree-ring-laboratory/tree-ring-research/dendroarchaeology/scientific-application|title=Scientific Application |year = 2012 | accessdate=April 12, 2012 |publisher=Columbia University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendrochronological dating is potentially applicable wherever trees were growing, except in tropical regions. For use in absolute dating of archaeological sites, it is partially limited by the availability of a master reference chronology for the region concerned. If there is a gap in the chronology (e.g. the inability to use a chronology constructed from pine samples in the British Isle prior to the 17th century due to the lack of use of pine in architecture then) then absolute dating cannot be applied.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt; Additionally, non-climatic influences can also affect the tree-ring pattern of timber samples. Even if a reference chronology is available, care must be taken to identify aberrations in the ring pattern to determine if the sample is usable for dating.&lt;ref name=Aitken&gt;{{cite book|last=Aitken|first=M.J.|title=Science-based Dating in Archaeology|year=1990|publisher=Longman Inc.|location=New York|isbn=0-582-05498-2|pages=37–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dendroarchaeology has been used extensively in the dating of historical buildings. After cross-matching the chronology from the building with the chronology of living trees, it is immediately possible to figure out the dates at which the historic timbers used in construction were felled. Similarly, if an extended chronology is available, then dating of samples from buildings of known or unknown date is possible. However, a limiting aspect of this application becomes apparent when dating medieval buildings. In such buildings, many timber samples lack completeness out to the underbark surface which can make the task of determining the felling year much more difficult.&lt;ref name=Goksu&gt;{{cite book|last=Gӧksu|first=H.Y.|title=Scientific Dating Methods|year=1991|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Luxembourg|isbn=0-7923-1461-1|pages=199–200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of dendroarchaeology in uncovering past trade patterns also becomes possible as chronology records for timber around the world become more complete and accessible. Patterns from individual samples will match much more closely with their native chronologies than with their regional chronology. For example, strong cross dating is found between Irish and English chronologies, but individual ring patterns tend to match better against their local chronologies. Hence, this strong geographical component of tree ring chronologies can be used to source timber samples at archaeological sites to uncover trade routes required for the site construction.&lt;ref name=Goksu /&gt;

Dendrochronology can also be used in concert with [[radiocarbon dating]] to allow for more accurate date measurements using radiocarbon dating on archaeological sites. It is known that the concentration of carbon-14 in the atmosphere is not constant. By performing radiocarbon dating on timber samples in a known chronology, radiocarbon dates can be plotted against real time generating a calibration curve that can be used for future radiocarbon samples.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt;

While dendrochronology is often considered as an absolute dating method, it can also be used as a powerful tool in the relative dating of an archaeological site. Timber samples may be able to be compared with others on the site to help construct a timeline of events for that particular site. Such samples can also be used to settle issues in constructing a chronological [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] for artifacts found on site. The important point is that such within-site analysis can be done whether or not a chronology is available to date the whole assemblage.&lt;ref name=Baillie /&gt;

A '''gaonburha''' or '''gaoburha''' is the leader of an Assamese [[Gaon (village)|gaon]] or [[village]]. The role of gaonburhas in Assamese gaons that are under [[mouza]]s are limited, since mouzadars take the responsibility of the gaonburha. For gaons that are far from district heads or major cities, gaonburhas still play difinitive roles.

'''Helia Bravo Hollis''' (30 September 1901 – 26 September 2001) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[Botany|botanist]], distinguished with the titles of Emeritus Researcher and [[honoris causa doctorate]] by the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM.]] For many years she developed her scientific research at the [[Faculty of Sciences]] of the same university.&lt;ref name="EggliNewton2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Urs Eggli|author2=Leonard E. Newton|title=Etymological Dictionary of Succulent Plant Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gf3uCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31|date=29 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-662-07125-0|pages=31–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background and Studies ==
She was born and raised in the neighborhood of [[Mixcoac]], in [[Mexico City]]. Her interest in the study of living beings came from Sunday walks with her parents.

Though the [[Mexican Revolution]] conflicts affected her family, she made progress with her studies and entered high school in 1919.

Saint Ildefonso ([[Escuela Nacional Preparatoria|National Preparatory High School]]), in [[Mexico City]], was a very interesting institution for her, with professors like [[Vicente Lombardo Toledano]], Sotero Prieto, Erasmo Castellano, [[Antonio Caso Andrade|Antonio Caso]], and [[:es:Isaac Ochoterena|Isaac Ochoterena]], who influenced Bravo's interest in the [[biological sciences]].

Successfully finishing high school, she continued her studies in [[medicine]], as there was pressure from her family to become a doctor and [[biology]] was not available as a major at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]. However, an opportunity to study biology arose a year afterwards, and she transferred to study at the College of Sciences of the same university.

In 1931, she obtained the degree of [[Master of Science]] in [[Biology|Biological Sciences]] from the [[Faculty of Philosophy and Letters|College of Philosophy and Letters]] of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]], with the thesis ''Contribution to the knowledge of the cactus of [[Tehuacán]], [[Puebla]]''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cssaarchives.com/HELIA%20BRAVO-HOLLIS%20BIOGRAPHY.pdf|title=Helia Bravo Hollis Biography|last=Staples|first=Chuck|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' She received an honorary doctorate from UNAM in 1985&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== Contributions to Biology ==
Bravo worked in the field of [[zoology]] in the area of [[Parasitism|parasitic]] and free-living [[protozoa]], publishing nine studies between 1921 and 1927 while still a student alongside Professor [[Isaac Ochoterena]]. She joined the teaching faculty at the National Preparatory School as a teaching assistant, and later as a professor. 

She is invited to head the [[Biology]] Department of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]], which has changed its name to "Instituto de Biología de la [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]" after the University became autonomous in 1929.

In the 1950s, she returned to academic life and was a professor of [[Botany]] at the National School of Biological Sciences of the Instituto Politécnico Nacional. Two years later she returned to the Instituto de Biología at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]. It is during this period that she shared the leadership of the National Herbarium with Débora Ramírez Cantú.
[[File:Cactus type of succulent plant.jpg|alt=green round succulent cactus|thumb|Example of a succulent plant, the type of plants that Bravo studied]]
She made contributions to the area of [[floriculture]], although in the [[arid]] regions of eastern Mexico, she focused on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[cactaceae]].  She organized a collection of live [[cactaceae]] and other [[succulent plant]]s in order to observe their development and evaluate morphological characteristics.

She co-founded the Mexican Cactus Society (Sociedad Mexicana de Cactología) in 1951, and later helped to found the Botanical Gardens at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]] in 1959, serving as its director in the 1960s. She specialized in the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[Cactaceae|cactacea]] in [[Mexico]], authoring an entire [[monograph]] on the [[Mesoamerica]]n region.  She conducted fieldwork and worked in [[herbarium]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, disseminating her findings in publications, conferences, and in the classroom. 

Her scientific writings span over 160 publications, 60 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] descriptions, and 59 reclassifications. Bravo published her first book in 1937.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.femmesofstem.com/blog/historical-femme-feature-bravo-hollis|title=Women in Botany: Helia Bravo Hollis (1901 - 2001)|work=The Femmes of STEM|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors ==
Bravo obtained several distinctions as well as national and international recognitions. She received the Cactus d'Or Award from the International Organization for Succulent Plant Study (IOS) in 1980&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The last award she received was for her work regarding the flora of [[Metztitlán]], [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]], during the creation of the Reservation of the Biosphere in 2000.

The Helia Bravo Hollis Botanical Garden in Puebla, Mexico was named after her and is home to many endangered cactus species&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== Eponymy ===
Nine taxa of the flora and fauna of Mexico have been appointed in her honor, including:&lt;ref&gt;J. Gr. Brit. 18: 23. 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
* ([[Cactus|Cactaceae]]) ''[[Polaskia|Heliabravoa]]'' &lt;small&gt;[[Curt Backeberg|Backeb.]]&lt;/small&gt; &lt;small&gt;-- Cact. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Succ. &lt;/small&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="947">A '''helper virus''' is a virus used when producing copies of a [[helper dependent virus|helper dependent viral vector]] which does not have the ability to replicate on its own.  The helper virus is used to co-infect cells alongside the viral vector and provides the necessary [[enzymes]] for replication of the [[genome]] of the viral vector.

[[Hepatitis B virus|Hepatitis B virus (HBV)]] is an example of a helper virus that helps [[Hepatitis D virus|Hepatitis D virus (HDV)]] (a replication defective, helper dependent ssRNA virus) to replicate -- as HDV requires the surface antigen of HBV ([[HBsAg]]) for the encapsidation of its own genome. The envelope proteins on the outer surface of HDV are entirely provided by HBV.

{{pp|small=yes}} 
{{Good article}}
The '''Hollow Moon''' hypothesis, or '''Spaceship Moon''' hypothesis, proposes that Earth's [[Moon]] is either wholly hollow or otherwise contains a substantial interior space. No [[scientific evidence]] exists to support the idea; seismic observations and other data collected since spacecraft began to orbit or land on the Moon indicate that it has a thin crust, extensive mantle and small, dense core, although overall it is much less dense than Earth.

The Hollow Moon concept is similar to the better-known [[Hollow Earth]] hypothesis, which was a recurring plot device in pre-spaceflight [[science fiction]].  The first discussion of a hollow Earth was by scientist [[Edmond Halley]] in 1692, with the first mention of a hollow Moon being in [[H. G. Wells|H. G. Wells']] 1901 novel ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.

== Introduction ==
[[File:Halleold.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Edmond Halley]], with a diagram of his [[Hollow Earth#17th and 18th centuries|hollow Earth theory]]]]
The Hollow Moon hypothesis is the suggestion that the [[Moon]] is hollow, usually as a product of an alien civilization.&lt;ref name=armhol&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.armaghplanet.com/blog/is-the-moon-hollow.html |title=Is the Moon Hollow? |work=Armagh Planetarium |date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=colspa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/spaceship-moon-and-soviet-scientific-politics |title="Spaceship Moon" and Soviet Scientific Politics |work=[[Jason Colavito|JasonColavito.com]] |date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often called the Spaceship Moon hypothesis,&lt;ref name=armhol /&gt;&lt;ref name=colspa /&gt; and often corresponds with beliefs in [[UFO]]s or [[ancient astronauts]].&lt;ref name=colspa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/shows/ancient-aliens/season-11/episode-11 |title=Space Station Moon |work=[[Ancient Aliens]] |publisher=[[History Channel]] |at=S11, E11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggestion of a hollow moon first appeared in [[science fiction]], when [[H. G. Wells]] wrote about a hollow moon in his 1901 book ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.&lt;ref name=armhol /&gt;&lt;ref name=sservi&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sservi.nasa.gov/?question=hollow-moon |title=Hollow Moon |work=[[Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute]] |date=2 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of hollow planets was not new; Wells borrowed from earlier fictional works that described a [[hollow Earth]], such as the 1741 novel ''[[Niels Klim's Underground Travels]]'' by [[Ludvig Holberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=C-15i-FdHOIC&amp;pg=PA412#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=The Worlds of Victorian Fiction |editor=Jerome Hamilton Buckley |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |date=1975 |at=p. 412, n. 27|isbn=9780674962057 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Academic proposals for a hollow Earth pre-dated that.  [[Edmond Halley|Edmond Halley's]] hypotheses, advanced in 1692,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://archive.org/stream/philosophicaltra03royarich#page/474/mode/2up |title=An Account of the cause of the Change of the Variation of the Magnetic Needle; with an Hypothesis of the Structure of the Internal Parts of the Earth |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=III |date=1683–1694 |at=pp. 470-78, esp. p. 475 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1686.0107}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the first one to specify an actual void in the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dioi.org/kn/halleyhollow.htm |title=The Hollow World of Edmond Halley |author=N. Kollerstrom |journal=[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]] |date=1992 |volume=23 |pages=185–92|bibcode=1992JHA....23..185K |doi=10.1177/002182869202300304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek mythology, with its [[Hades]], and early religious concepts of an underworld, such as the Christian [[Hell]], contributed to ideas of the Earth being hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=c6PACQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |author=[[Brian Regal]] |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |date=2009 |page=81|isbn=9780313355080 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now considered to be a [[fringe theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Although not described as such by the media, it is more accurately a fringe theory than a conspiracy theory.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often described in the media as a [[conspiracy theory]],&lt;ref name=armhol /&gt;&lt;ref name=inqspa&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3142772/the-moon-is-an-alien-ufo-spaceship-parked-in-orbit-around-earth-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-says-video/ |title=The Moon Is An Alien UFO Spaceship Parked In Orbit Around Earth, Conspiracy Theorist David Icke Says [Video] |work=[[Inquisitr]] |date=28 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/771246/Hollow-Moon-theory-aliens |title='Hollow Moon that rings like a bell put into orbit by ancient ALIENS', shock theory claims |work=[[The Daily Express]] |date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the concept of the Moon as a spaceship is often mentioned as one of [[David Icke|David Icke's]] beliefs.&lt;ref name=inqspa /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/taking-tea-with-david-icke-the-worlds-bestknown-conspiracy-theorist-20160715-gq6poq.html |title=Taking tea with David Icke, the world's best-known conspiracy theorist  |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4797/mocked-prophet-what-is-david-ickes-appeal |title=Mocked prophet: what is David Icke's appeal? |work=[[New Humanist]] |date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Claims and rebuttals ==
[[File:Spaceship moon.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.75|Speculative cutaway model of a Spaceship Moon]]

=== Vasin-Shcherbakov ===
In 1970, Michael Vasin and Alexander Shcherbakov, of what was then the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]], advanced a hypothesis that the Moon is a spaceship created by unknown beings.&lt;ref name=colspa /&gt;  The article was entitled "Is the Moon the Creation of Alien Intelligence?", and was published in ''[[Sputnik (magazine)|Sputnik]]'',&lt;ref name=inqspa /&gt; the Soviet equivalent of ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref name=armhol /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=s3iukQc_DBEC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Cold War Space Sleuths |editor= Dominic Phelan |publisher=[[Springer-Praxis]] |date=2013 |page=34|isbn=9781461430520 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their hypothesis relies heavily on the suggestion that large [[lunar craters]], generally assumed to be formed from meteor impact, are generally too shallow and have flat or even convex bottoms.  They hypothesized that small meteors are making a cup-shaped depression in the rocky surface of the moon while the larger meteors are drilling through a rocky layer and hitting an armoured hull underneath.&lt;ref name=inqpar&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.inquisitr.com/1917650/our-moon-is-an-alien-ufo-spaceship-parked-in-orbit-around-earth-ufologists-claim/ |title=Our Moon Is An Alien UFO Spaceship Parked In Orbit Around Earth, UFOlogists Claim |work=Inquisitr |date=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors reference earlier speculation by astrophysicist [[Iosif Shklovsky]], who suggested that the Martian moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] was an artificial satellite and hollow; this has since been shown to not be the case.  Sceptical author [[Jason Colavito]] points out that all of their evidence is circumstantial, and that in the 1960s the atheistic Soviet Union promoted the [[ancient astronaut]] concept in an attempt to undermine the West's faith in religion.&lt;ref name=colspa /&gt;

=== The Moon rang like a bell ===
Between 1972 and 1977, [[seismometers]] installed on the Moon by the [[Apollo missions]] recorded [[moonquakes]].  The Moon was described as "ringing like a bell" during some of those quakes, specifically the shallow ones.&lt;ref name=nasmoo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/15mar_moonquakes.html |title=Moonquakes |work=[[NASA]] |date=15 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This phrase was brought to popular attention in March 1970,&lt;ref name=armhol /&gt; in an article in ''[[Popular Science]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=6QAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true |title=How APOLLO 13 Will Probe The Moon's Interior |author=[[Wernher von Braun]] |work=[[Popular Science]] |date=March 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Apollo 12 deliberately crashed the Ascent Stage of its [[Lunar Module]] onto the Moon's surface, it was claimed that the Moon rang like a bell for an hour, leading to arguments that it must be hollow like a bell.&lt;ref name=armhol /&gt;  Lunar seismology experiments since then have shown that the lunar body has shallow moonquakes that act differently from quakes on Earth, due to differences in texture, type and density of the planetary strata, but there is no evidence of any large empty space inside the body.&lt;ref name=nasmoo /&gt;

=== Density ===
The fact that the Moon is less dense than the Earth is advanced as support for it to be hollow.  The moon's mean [[density]] is 3.3 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; whereas the Earth's is 5.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=inqpar /&gt; One explanation of this discrepancy is that [[Moon#Formation|the moon may have been formed]] by a giant impact which ejected some of the early Earth's upper crust into its orbit.&lt;ref name=sservi /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/07/01/the_moon_s_two_faces_why_are_they_so_different.html |title=Why Do We Have a Two-Faced Moon? |work=[[Bad Astronomer]] |date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth's upper mantle and crust are less dense than its core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cain|first1=Fraser|title=Density of the Moon|url=http://www.universetoday.com/20601/density-of-the-moon/|website=Universe Today|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=3 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There, physicist Suniti Karunatillake suggests that there are at least two ways to determine the distribution of mass within a body.  One involves [[Moment of inertia factor|moment of inertia parameters]], the other involves [[Seismology|seismic observations]].  In the case of the former, Karunatillake points out that the moment of inertia parameters indicate that the core of the moon is both dense and small, with the rest of the moon consisting of material with nearly-constant density.  As for the latter, he notes that the moon is the only planetary body besides Earth on which extensive seismic observations have been made.  These observations have constrained the thickness of the moon's crust, mantle and core, suggesting it could not be hollow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=738 |title=Can we prove that the Moon isn't hollow? |work=Ask an Astronomer |publisher=Cornell University |date=October 2007 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422063519/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=738 |archivedate=2008-04-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[DNA]] segment is [[Identity by type|identical by state]] (IBS) in two or more individuals if they have identical [[nucleotide sequences]] in this segment. An IBS segment is '''identical by descent''' ('''IBD''') (note: the acronym IBD is also used for another concept in population genetics, [[isolation by distance]]) in two or more individuals if they have inherited it from a common ancestor without [[genetic recombination|recombination]], that is, the segment has the same ancestral origin in these individuals. DNA segments that are IBD are IBS per definition, but segments that are not IBD can still be IBS due to the same [[mutation]]s in different individuals or recombinations that do not alter the segment.

== Theory ==
All individuals in a finite population are related if traced back long enough and will, therefore, share segments of their [[genomes]] IBD. During [[meiosis]] segments of IBD are broken up by recombination. Therefore, the expected length of an IBD segment depends on the number of generations since the [[most recent common ancestor]] at the locus of the segment. The length of IBD segments that result from a common ancestor ''n'' generations in the past (therefore involving 2''n'' meiosis) is exponentially distributed with mean 1/(2''n'') [[Centimorgan|Morgans]] (M).&lt;ref name="Browning.2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expected number of IBD segments decreases with the number of generations since the common ancestor at this locus. For a specific DNA segment, the probability of being IBD decreases as 2&lt;sup&gt;−2''n''&lt;/sup&gt; since in each meiosis the probability of transmitting this segment is 1/2.&lt;ref name="Thompson.2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Applications ==
Identified IBD segments can be used for a wide range of purposes. As noted above the amount (length and number) of IBD sharing depends on the familial relationships between the tested individuals. Therefore, one application of IBD segment detection is to quantify relatedness.&lt;ref name="Albrechtsen.2009"&gt;{{Cite journal

=== IBD mapping ===
IBD mapping&lt;ref name=" Albrechtsen.2009"/&gt; is similar to linkage analysis, but can be performed without a known pedigree on a cohort of unrelated individuals.

=== IBD in population genetics ===
Detection of [[natural selection]] in the human genome is also possible via detected IBD segments. Selection will usually tend to increase the number of IBD segments among individuals in a population. By scanning for regions with excess IBD sharing, regions in the human genome that have been under strong, very recent selection can be identified.&lt;ref name="Albrechtsen.2010"&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Laysan honeycreeper''' or '''Laysan {{okina}}apapane''' (''Himatione fraithii'') is an extinct bird species that was  [[Endemism|endemic]] to the island of [[Laysan]] in the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]].

==Taxonomy==
The species was described by the British ornithologist [[Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild|Walter Rothschild]] in 1892 under its current binomial name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rothschild | first=Walter | year=1892 | title=Himatione fraithii | journal=The Annals and Magazine of Natural History | series=6th series | volume=10 | page=109 | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/27658714 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review published in 1950, the American ornithologist [[Dean Amadon]] treated the Laysan honeycreeper as a subspecies of the [[ʻApapane]] and adopted the [[trinomial name]] ''Himatione sanguinea freethii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Amadon | first=Dean | year=1950 | title=The Hawaiian honeycreepers (Aves, Drepaniidae) | series=Bulletin of the American Museum of Natural History | volume=95 | issue=Article 4 | page=174 | url=http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/dspace/handle/2246/1077 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent publications followed this lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Proposal 2015-A-10: Split Laysan Honeycreeper from ''Apapane Himatione sanguinea'' and change its specific epithet to  ''fraithii'' | url=http://checklist.aou.org/nacc/proposals/PDF/2015-A.pdf#37 | publisher=American Ornithologists' Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 the North American Classification Committee (NACC) of the [[American Ornithologists' Union]] decided to promote the extinct honeycreeper to the species level and to adopt the original binomial name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Chesser | first1=R. Terry |display-authors=etal | year=2015 | title=Fifty-sixth Supplement to the American Ornithologists’ Union ''Check-list of North American Birds'' | journal=The Auk | volume=132 |issue= | pages=748–764 | doi=10.1642/AUK-15-73.1 | url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/pdf/10.1642/AUK-15-73.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This change was adopted by the [[International Ornithological Committee]] in their world list of birds.&lt;ref name=ioc&gt;{{cite web| editor1-last=Gill | editor1-first=Frank | editor2-last=Donsker | editor2-first=David | title=Finches, euphonias | work= World Bird List Version 5.3| url=http://www.worldbirdnames.org/bow/finches/ | publisher=International Ornithologists' Union| accessdate=23 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Laysan ʻApapane.ogv|thumb|left|Footage of a live specimen from 1923]] 
[[Image:Laysan Honey Eater nest.jpg|thumb|left|Nest]] 
An adult male Laysan honeycreeper had vermilion upperparts, an ashy-brown lower abdomen and underwing-coverts, and brownish-white undertail-coverts.  Adult females were similar to the male, but had paler red feathers.  After molting, the feathers were brighter but faded with sunlight exposure.&lt;ref name="BirdsNorthAm"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Birds of North America]] |first=Steven G |last=Fancy |author2=C. John Ralph  |editor=A. Poole; F. Gill |title=ʻApapane |volume=296 |year=1997 |publisher=[[Academy of Natural Sciences]] |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/publications/4251/fancy1.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
Laysan honeycreepers [[Nectarivore|fed]] on [[nectar]] from the native [[flower]]s on the island, especially ''maiapilo'' ([[Capparis sandwichiana]]). When populations of that species declined, it was forced to feed on nectar from ''{{okina}}ākulikuli'' (''[[Sesuvium portulacastrum]]'') and ''{{okina}}ihi'' (''[[Portulaca]] lutea'').  It was observed visiting ''koali {{okina}}awa'' (''[[Ipomoea indica]]''), ''pōhuehue'' (''[[Ipomoea pes-caprae|I. pes-caprae brasiliensis]]''), and ''nohu'' (''[[Tribulus]] cistoides''), and would also feed on [[caterpillar]]s and [[moth]]s. Unlike the [[ʻapapane]], the Laysan honeycreeper foraged on the ground.&lt;ref name="BirdsNorthAm" /&gt;

==Breeding==
Laysan honeycreeper primarily nested in the center of tall [[Tussock (grass)|grass bunches]], but sometimes built nests in  dense ''{{okina}}āheahea'' (''[[Chenopodium]] sandwichensis'') [[shrub]]s.  Nests were made of rootlets interwoven with grass blades.  The clutch size was four to five [[bird egg|eggs]].&lt;ref name="BirdsNorthAm" /&gt;

==Extinction==
[[Domestic rabbit]]s were [[Introduced species|introduced]] to the island in the late 19th century, and quickly consumed nearly all vegetation on the island, including nectar sources for the Laysan honeycreeper. The bird was filmed in 1923 during the [[Tanager Expedition]]. Shortly after, Laysan was battered by a strong storm, and later attempts at finding any remaining Laysan honeycreeper failed.&lt;ref name="Tanager"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hawaiianatolls.org/video/tanager.php |title=1923 USS Tanager Expedition |work=Video |publisher=Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Mult-Agency Education Project |accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other birds also inhabited the island, including the [[Laysan millerbird]], the [[Laysan rail]], the [[Laysan duck]], and the [[Laysan finch]]. Of these, only the finch and the duck remain [[Extant taxon|extant]].

A controversial taxon that some paleontologists have considered to be juvenile ''[[Desmatosuchus haplocerus]]'' scutes.&lt;ref name="irmis2005-7577-Acaenasuchus" /&gt; However, Randall Irmis notes that the ''Acaenasuchus'' scutes have unique characters.&lt;ref name="irmis2005-7577-Acaenasuchus" /&gt; Some earlier workers attributed these characters to the allegedly young age of the specimens.&lt;ref name="irmis2005-7577-Acaenasuchus" /&gt; However, Irmis notes that the ontogenetic stage of the specimens has not been confirmed and that in aetosaur genera with known juvenile remains, there are no appreciable physical differences between the younger and older individuals.&lt;ref name="irmis2005-7577-Acaenasuchus" /&gt; Irmis suggested that future researchers treat Acaenasuchus as its own taxon until contrary evidence surfaces.&lt;ref name="irmis2005-7577-Acaenasuchus" /&gt;

Although originally referred to ''Desmatosuchus'', Randall Irmis considers it to be a new taxon closely related to ''[[Paratypothorax]]'' based on a phylogenetic analysis performed on the remains by Parker in 2003.&lt;ref name="irmis2005-75-dchamaensis" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21554">[[Solar storm (disambiguation)|Solar storms]] of different types are caused by disturbances on the Sun, most often [[coronal cloud]]s associated with [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs) produced by [[solar flare]]s emanating from active [[sunspot]] regions, or, less often, from [[coronal hole]]s.

==Background==
Active stars produce disturbances in [[space weather]] with the field of [[heliophysics]] the science that studies such phenomena; itself primarily an interdisciplinary combination of [[solar physics]] and [[planetary science]]. In the [[Solar System]], the [[Sun]] can produce intense [[Geomagnetic storm|geomagnetic]] and [[Solar proton event|proton]] storms capable of causing severe damage to technology including but not limited to large scale [[power outage]]s, disruption or [[Communications blackout|blackouts]] of radio communications (including [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]), and temporary to permanent disabling of satellites and other spaceborne technology. Intense solar storms may also be hazardous to high-latitude, high-altitude aviation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.radsonaplane.com/ RadsOnAPlane.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[human spaceflight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Phillips |first = Tony |title = Severe Space Weather--Social and Economic Impacts |work = NASA Science News |publisher = National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date = 21 Jan 2009 |url = https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/21jan_severespaceweather/ |accessdate = 2014-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geomagnetic storms are the cause of [[aurora]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = NOAA Space Weather Scales |publisher = NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center |date = 1 Mar 2005 |url = http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/images/NOAAscales.pdf |accessdate = 2017-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant known solar storm occurred in September 1859 and is known as the "[[Carrington event]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Bell |first = Trudy E. |author2=T.

[[Image:Monoisotopic, mononuclidic, radioactive elements.svg|thumb|right|366px|{{color strip|border=2|w=2|#00FF00}} Mononuclidic ''and'' monoisotopic (19&amp;nbsp;elements)&lt;br/&gt;{{color strip|border=2|#FF6600|#FF0000}} Three mononuclidic, but [[radioactive]] elements]]

A '''mononuclidic element''' or '''monotopic element'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft4th|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the 22 [[chemical element]]s that is found naturally on Earth essentially as a single [[nuclide]] (which may, or may not, be a [[stable nuclide]]). This single nuclide will have a characteristic [[atomic mass]]. Thus, the element's [[Natural abundance|natural isotopic abundance]] is dominated either by one stable [[isotope]] or by one very long-lived isotope. There are 19&amp;nbsp;elements in the first category (which are both monoisotopic and mononuclidic), and 3 ([[bismuth]],&lt;ref&gt;Until 2003, &lt;sup&gt;209&lt;/sup&gt;Bi was thought to be in the first category. It was then found to have a [[half-life]] of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; years, about a billion times the age of the universe. See [[Bismuth#Notable_characteristics|Bismuth]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[thorium]] and [[protactinium]]) in the second category (mononuclidic but not monoisotopic, since they have zero, not one, stable nuclides). A list of the 22 mononuclidic elements is given at the end of this article.

Of the 26 ''[[monoisotopic element]]s'' that, by definition, have only one stable isotope, there exist 7 (26 minus 19 = 7) which are nevertheless ''not'' considered mononuclidic, due to the presence of a significant fraction of a very long-lived ([[primordial nuclide|primordial]]) radioisotope occurring in their natural abundance. These elements are [[vanadium]], [[rubidium]], [[indium]], [[lanthanum]], [[europium]], [[rhenium]], and [[lutetium]].

== Use in metrology ==
Mononuclidic elements are of scientific importance because their [[atomic weight]]s can be [[metrology|measured]] to high accuracy, since there is minimal uncertainty associated with the isotopic abundances present in a given sample. Another way of stating this, is that, for these elements, the [[standard atomic weight]] and [[atomic mass]] are the same.&lt;ref&gt;N. E. Holden, "Standard Atomic Weight Values for the Mononuclidic Elements - 2001," [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/782053-S3nk8u/native/782053.pdf BNL-NCS-68362], [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; 

In practice, only 11 of the mononuclidic elements are used in standard atomic weight metrology. These are aluminium, bismuth, caesium, cobalt, gold, manganese, phosphorus, scandium, sodium, terbium, and thorium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2006/pdf/7811x2051.pdf IUPAC list of mononuclidics for metrology purposes]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (NMR), the three most sensitive stable nuclei are [[hydrogen-1]] (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H), [[fluorine-19]] (&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F) and [[phosphorus-31]] (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P). Fluorine and phosphorus are monoisotopic, with hydrogen nearly so. [[Proton nuclear magnetic resonance|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H NMR]], [[Fluorine-19 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F NMR]] and [[Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance|&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P NMR]] allow for identification and study of compounds containing these elements.

== Contamination by unstable trace isotopes ==
Trace concentrations of unstable isotopes of some mononuclidic elements are found in natural samples. For example, [[beryllium-10]] (&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be), with a [[half-life]] of 1.4 million years, is produced by [[cosmic ray]]s in the [[Earth]]'s [[upper atmosphere]]; [[iodine-129]] (&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;I), with a [[half-life]] of 15.7 million years, is produced by various cosmogenic and nuclear mechanisms; [[caesium-137]] (&lt;sup&gt;137&lt;/sup&gt;Cs), with a [[half-life]] of 30&amp;nbsp;years, is generated by [[nuclear fission]]. Such isotopes are used in a variety of analytical and forensic applications.

[[File:Nieves Lopez Martinez.JPG|thumbnail|Nieves Lopez Martinez]]
'''Nieves López Martínez''' ([[Burgos]], 5 February 1949 - [[Madrid]], 15 December 2010) was a Spanish paleontologist specializing in research on the vertebrate fossil record and part of a group of paleontologists who were responsible for the modernization of paleontological studies in Spain.

Lopez Martinez studied at [[Complutense University of Madrid]], graduating in Biological Sciences in 1970. She received a scholarship to do her PhD work, under the supervision of Dr. Louis Thaler at the [[University of Montpellier]].&lt;ref name="Hernández2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hernández|first1=Manuel|title=Nieves López Martínez, el entusiasmo por la Ciencia|url=http://www.pmmv.com.es/en/node/249|publisher=Paleoclimatología, Macroecología y Macroevolución de Vertebrados|accessdate=15 October 2014|language=Spanish|date=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

López Martínez was recognized worldwide as a leading figure in the study of the evolution of [[Cenozoic]] [[lagomorph]]s, as well as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] in the area of the [[Pyrenees]]. She was also very involved with university teaching programs, both officially at the Complutense University of Madrid and through various projects, such as the Somosaguas Paleontology Project, which was associated with the [[Somosaguas paleontological site]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to brain mapping:

[[Brain mapping]] &amp;ndash; set of neuroscience techniques predicated on the mapping of (biological) quantities or properties onto spatial representations of the (human or non-human) brain resulting in maps. Brain mapping is further defined as the study of the anatomy and function of the brain and spinal cord through the use of imaging (including intra-operative, microscopic, endoscopic and multi-modality imaging), immunohistochemistry, molecular &amp; optogenetics, stem cell and cellular biology, engineering (material, electrical and biomedical), neurophysiology and nanotechnology.

* [[Neuroscience]]
* [[Nervous system]].

===The neuron doctrine===
* [[Neuron doctrine]] –  A set of carefully constructed elementary set of observations regarding neurons. ''For more granularity, more current, and more advanced topics, see the [[List of topics related to brain mapping#Cellular level|cellular level]] section''
* Asserts that neurons fall under the broader [[cell theory]], which postulates:
** All living organisms are composed of one or more cells.
** The cell is the basic unit of structure, function, and organization in all organisms.
** All cells come from preexisting, living cells.
* The Neuron doctrine postulates several elementary aspects of neurons:
** The brain is made up of individual cells (neurons) that contain specialized features such as [[dendrite]]s, a cell body, and an [[axon]].
** Neurons are cells differentiable from other tissues in the body.
** Neurons differ in size, shape, and structure according to their location or functional specialization.
** Every neuron has a nucleus, which is the trophic center of the cell (The part which must have access to nutrition). If the cell is divided, only the portion containing the nucleus will survive.
** [[Nerve fiber]]s are the result of cell processes and the outgrowths of nerve cells. (Several axons are bound together to form one nerve fibril. See also: [[Neurofilament]]. Several nerve fibrils then form one large nerve fiber. [[Myelin]], an electrical insulator, forms around selected axons.
** Neurons are generated by cell division.
** Neurons are connected by sites of contact and not via cytoplasmic continuity. (A [[cell membrane]] isolates the inside of the cell from its environment. Neurons do not communicate via direct cytoplasm to cytoplasm contact.)
** Law of dynamic polarization. Although the axon can conduct in both directions, in tissue there is a preferred ''direction'' of transmission from cell to cell.
* Elements added later to the initial Neuron doctrine
** A barrier to transmission exists at the site of contact between two neurons that may permit transmission. (Synapse)
** Unity of transmission. If a contact is made between two cells, then that contact can be either ''excitatory'' or ''inhibitory'', but will always be of the same type.
** Dale's law, each nerve terminal releases a ''single'' type of neurotransmitter.
* Some of the basic postulates in the Neuron doctrine have been subsequently questioned, refuted, or updated. See the [[List of topics related to brain mapping#Cellular level|cellular level]] section topics for additional information.

===Map, atlas, and database projects===
* [[Brain Activity Map Project]] 2013 NIH $3 billion project to map every neuron in the human brain in ten years, based upon the Human Genome Project.
:* NIH Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative [http://www.nih.gov/science/brain/]
:* Community outreach site for above where the public may comment [http://brainfeedback.nih.gov/]
* [[Human Brain Project (EU)]] – 1 billion euro, 10-year project to simulate the human brain with supercomputers.
:* [[BigBrain]] A high-resolution 3D atlas of the human brain created as part of the HBP.
* [[Human Connectome Project]] – 2009 NIH $30 million project to build a network map of the human brain, including structural (anatomical) and functional elements. Emphasis included research into dyslexia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. See also [[Connectome]] a, comprehensive map of neural connections in the brain.
* [[Allen Brain Atlas]] 2003 $100 million project funded by Paul Allen (Microsoft)
* [http://www.brain-connect.eu/ CONNECT]. This project pulls together the EU’s world-leading diffusion MRI community to focus on the fundamental advances key to the long-term realisation of microstructure and connectivity mapping of the live human brain as well as exploitation of that information by medical and neuroscience researchers. 
* [[BrainMaps]] National Institute of Health (NIH) database including 60 terabytes of image scans of primate and non-primates, integrated with information covering structure and function.
* [[NeuroNames]]  Defines the brain in terms of about 550 ''primary'' structures (about 850 ''unique'' structures) to which all other structures, names, and synonyms are related. About 15,000 neuroanatomical terms are cross indexed, including many synonyms in seven languages. Coverage includes the brain and spinal cord of the four species most frequently studied by neuroscientists: human, macaque (monkey), rat and mouse. The controlled, standardized vocabulary for each structure is located in an unambiguous, strict physical hierarchy, and these terms are selected based on ease of pronunciation, mnemonic value, and frequency of use in recent neuroscientific publications. Relation of each structure to its superstructures and substructures is included. The controlled vocabulary is suitable for uniquely indexing neuroanatomical information in digital databases.

==Imaging and recording systems==

This section covers imaging and recording systems. The general section covers history, neuroimaging, and techniques for mapping specific neural connections. The specific systems section covers the various specific technologies, including experimental and widely deployed imaging and recording systems.

===General===
* Most imaging work to date on individual neurons has been conducted outside the brain, typically on large neurons, and has been most frequently destructive. New techniques are however rapidly emerging. Search on ''"Single neuron imaging"'' and see related topics: [[Biological neuron model]], [[Single-unit recording]], [[Neural oscillation#Single neuron model]], [[Computational neuroscience#Single-neuron modeling]]. dMRI (above) is also promising in non-destructive imaging of single neurons inside the brain.
* [[History of neuroimaging]] (redirects from Brain scanner)
* [[Neuroimaging]] (redirects from Brain function map)
* [[Connectomics]] – mapping technique showing neural connections in a nervous system.

===Specific systems===
* [[Cortical stimulation mapping]]
* [[Diffusion MRI]] (dMRI) – includes ''diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)'' and  ''diffusion functional MRI (DfMRI)''.  dMRI is a recent breakthrough in brain mapping allowing the visualization of cross connections between different anatomical parts of the brain.  It allows noninvasive imaging of white matter fiber structure and in addition to mapping can be useful in clinical observations of abnormalities, including damage from stroke.
* [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) Uses electrodes on the scalp and other techniques to detect the electrical flow of currents.
* [[Electrocorticography]] intracranial EEG, the practice of using electrodes placed directly on the exposed surface of the brain to record electrical activity from the cerebral cortex.
* [[Electrophysiological techniques for clinical diagnosis]]
* [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI)
* [[Medical image computing]] (brain research of leads medical and surgical uses of mapping technology)
* [[Neurostimulation]] (in research stimulation is frequently used in conjunction with imaging)
* [[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) a nuclear medical imaging technique that produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional processes in the body. The system detects pairs of gamma rays emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), which is introduced into the body on a biologically active molecule. Three-dimensional images of tracer concentration within the body are then constructed by computer analysis. In modern scanners, three dimensional imaging is often accomplished with the aid of a CT X-ray scan performed on the patient during the same session, in the same machine.

===Imaging and recording componentry===

====Electrochemical====
* [[Haemodynamic response]] the rapid delivery of blood to active neuronal tissues. Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent signal (BOLD), corresponds to the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin. The BOLD effect is based on the fact that when neuronal activity is increased in one part of the brain, there is also an increased amount of cerebral blood flow to that area. Functional magnetic resonance imaging is enabled by the detection of the BOLD signal.
* [[Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging]] can be used to detect changes in the Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) hemodynamic response to neural activity in response to certain events.

====Electrical====
* [[Event-related potential]] positive and negative 10µ to 100µ Volts (µ is millionths) responses, measured via noninvasive electrodes attached to the scalp, that are the reliable and repeatable results of a certain specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event. These are also called ''a stereotyped electrophysiological response to a stimulus.'' They are called [[somatosensory evoked potentials]] when they are elicited by sensory (vs. cognitive or motor) event stimuli. The voltage swing sequences are recorded and broken down by positive and negative, and by how long after the stimulus they are observed. For example, [N100] is a negative swing observed between 80 and 120 milliseconds (100 being the midpoint) after the onset of the stimulus. Alternatively, the voltage swings are labeled based on their order, N1 being the first negative swing observed, N2 the second negative swing, etc. See: [[N100 (neuroscience)]], [[N200 (neuroscience)]], [[P300 (neuroscience)]], [[N400 (neuroscience)]], [[P600 (neuroscience)]]. The first negative and positive swings (see [[Visual N1]], [[C1 and P1 (neuroscience)]]) in response to visual stimulation are of particular interest in studying sensitivity and selectiveness of attention.

====Electromagnetic====
* [[Magnetoencephalography]]  – a technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers In research, MEG's primary use is the measurement of ''time courses'' of activity. MEG can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster, while functional MRI (fMRI), which depends on changes in blood flow, can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds. MEG also accurately pinpoints sources in primary auditory, somatosensory and motor areas. For creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, MEG is most often combined with fMRI, as the methods complement each other. Neuronal (MEG) and hemodynamic (fMRI) data do not necessarily agree, in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials (LFP) and blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals

====Radiological====
* Positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer). See [[Positron emission tomography]]
* [[Altanserin]] a compound that binds to a serotonin receptor. When labeled with the isotope fluorine-18 it is used as a radioligand in positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the brain.

====Visual processing and image enhancement====
* [[Scientific visualization]] an interdisciplinary branch of science primarily concerned with the visualization of three-dimensional phenomena (including medical, biological, and others), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component. It is considered a branch of computer science that is a subset of computer graphics. Brain mapping is a leading beneficiary of advances in scientific visualization.
* [[Blob detection]] an area in computer vision, A blob is a region of a digital image in which some properties (such as brightness or color, compared to areas surrounding those regions) are constant or vary within a prescribed range of values; all the points in a blob can be considered in some sense to be similar to each other

====Information technology====
* [[Determining the number of clusters in a data set]] A typical application is in data reduction: as the increase in temporal resolution of fMRI experiments routinely yields fMRI sequences containing several hundreds of images, it is sometimes necessary to invoke feature extraction to reduce the dimensionality of the data space.
* [[Fractional anisotropy]] a measure often used in diffusion imaging where it is thought to reflect fiber density, axonal diameter, and myelination in white matter. The FA is an extension of the concept of eccentricity of conic sections in 3 dimensions, normalized to the unit range. [[Anisotropy]] is the property of being directionally dependent, as opposed to isotropy, which implies identical properties in all directions.
* [[General linear model]] – a statistical linear model. It may be written as Y=XB +U where Y is a matrix with series of multivariate measurements, X is a matrix that might be a design matrix, B is a matrix containing parameters that are usually to be estimated, and U is a matrix containing errors or noise. It is frequently used in the analysis of multiple brain scans in scientific experiments where Y contains data from brain scanners, X contains experimental design variables and confounds. See also:  [[statistical parametric mapping]]
* [[Resampling (statistics)]] see section on permutation tests. Nonparametric Permutation Tests are used in fMRI.

====Software packages====
* [[Analysis of Functional NeuroImages]] an open-source environment for processing and displaying functional MRI data
* [[Cambridge Brain Analysis]] a software repository developed at University of Cambridge for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis under the GNU General Public License and runs under Linux.
* [[Statistical parametric mapping]] – a statistical technique for examining differences in brain activity recorded during functional neuroimaging experiments using neuroimaging technologies such as fMRI or PET. It may also refer to a specific piece of software created by the Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience (part of University College London) to carry out such analyses.
* [[ITK-SNAP]] an interactive software application that allows users to navigate three-dimensional medical images, manually delineate anatomical regions of interest, and perform automatic image segmentation. Its most frequently used to work with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) data sets.
* The [[Budapest Reference Connectome]] server generates consensus braingraphs with selectable parameters; the graphs can be downloaded in annotated [[GraphML]] format, and can also be viewed instantly on the site.

A '''pedicel''' is a stem that attaches a single [[flower]] to the  [[inflorescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001 |title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a pedicel, the flowers are described as [[Sessility (botany)|sessile]]. Pedicel is also applied to the stem of the [[infructescence]]. The word "pedicel" is derived from the latin ''pediculus'', meaning "little foot".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Etymological Dictionary of the English Language |author= Walter William Skeat |edition= 3 |publisher= Clarendon Press |year= 1898 |page= 430}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The stem or branch from the main stem of the inflorescence that holds a group of pedicels is called a [[Peduncle (botany)|peduncle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page= 136 |title= The Fundamentals of Horticulture: Theory and Practice |editor= Chris Bird |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year= 2014 |isbn= 9781107782549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Halloween types of [[pumpkin]] or squash plants, the shape of the pedicel has received particular attention because plant breeders are trying to optimize the size and shape of the pedicel for the best "lid" for a "[[jack-o'-lantern]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15494640/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/striving-breed-better-pumpkin/ Breeding a better pumpkin - Technology &amp; science - Science | NBC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[theoretical physics]], the '''Peierls bracket''' is an equivalent description{{what|reason=Sorry, but does this mean it is the same as the Poisson bracket?|date=August 2016}} of the [[Poisson bracket]]. It can be defined directly from the [[action (physics)|action]] and does not require the [[canonical coordinate]]s and their [[canonical momenta]] to be defined in advance.{{what|reason=Does the Peierls bracket even require the action? The Poisson bracket does not need the action to be defined. Nor does it need a choice of canonical coordinates. It only needs the symplectic structure.|date=August 2016}} 

The bracket{{what|reason=Now this looks like the Lie bracket. Is the Peierls bracket the Lie Bracket?|date=August 2016}} 

:&lt;math&gt;[A,B]&lt;/math&gt;

is defined as 

:&lt;math&gt;D_A(B)-D_B(A)&lt;/math&gt;,

as the difference between some kind of action of one quantity on the other, minus the flipped term. 

In [[quantum mechanics]], the Peierls bracket becomes a [[commutator]] i.e. a [[Lie bracket of vector fields|Lie bracket]].

'''Polar exploration''' is the process of [[exploration]] of the [[polar regions]] of the [[Earth]] - the [[Arctic region]] and [[Antarctica]] - particularly with the goal of reaching the [[North Pole]] and [[South Pole]], respectively. Historically, this was accomplished by explorers making often arduous travels on foot or by sled in these regions, known as a '''polar expedition'''. More recently, exploration has been accomplished with technology, particularly with [[satellite imagery]].

From 600 BC to 300 BC [[Greek philosophy|Greek Philosophers]] theorized that the planet was a [[Spherical Earth]] with [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole|South]] [[Polar region]]s. By 150 [[Anno Domini|AD]] [[Ptolemy]] published [[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]], which notes a hypothetical [[Terra Australis|Terra Australis Incognita]]. However, due to harsh weather conditions, the poles themselves would not be reached for centuries after that. When they finally were reached, the achievement was realized only a few years apart.

There are two claims, both disputed, about who was the first person to reach the [[geographic North Pole]]. [[Frederick Cook]], accompanied by two [[Inuit]] men, Ahwelah and Etukishook claimed to have reached the Pole on April 21, 1908, although this claim is generally doubted. On April 6, 1909, [[Robert Peary]] claimed to be the first person in recorded history to reach the North Pole,&lt;ref name="arcticchronology"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml|title=ARCTIC EXPLORATION - CHRONOLOGY|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=Quark Expeditions|year=2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911074922/http://www.quarkexpeditions.com/arctic/exploration.shtml |archivedate = 2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by his employee [[Matthew Henson]] and four Inuit men Ootah, [[Seegloo]], Egingway, and Ooqueah (although whether he actually reached the Pole is doubted by some).&lt;ref name="columbia"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/library/encyclopedia/arctic_the.jsp|title=ARCTIC, THE|accessdate=2006-10-19|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2004|work=Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="caencyclo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=J1ARTJ0005796|title=North Pole|accessdate=2006-10-20|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian explorer [[Roald Amundsen]] had planned to reach the [[North Pole]] by means of an extended drift in an icebound ship. He obtained the use of [[Fridtjof Nansen]]'s polar exploration ship ''[[Fram]]'', and undertook extensive fundraising. Preparations for this expedition were disrupted when Cook and Peary each claimed to have reached the North Pole. Amundsen then changed his plan and began to prepare for a conquest of the [[geographic South Pole]]; uncertain of the extent to which the public and his backers would support him, he kept this revised objective secret. When he set out in June&amp;nbsp;1910, he led even his crew to believe they were embarking on an Arctic drift, and revealed their true Antarctic destination only when ''Fram'' was leaving their last port of call, Madeira.

[[Amundsen's South Pole expedition]], with Amundsen and four others, arrived at the pole on 14&amp;nbsp;December 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Some sources give the date as 15&amp;nbsp;December. Since the western and eastern hemispheres are conjoined at the South Pole, both dates can be considered as correct, though Amundsen gives 14&amp;nbsp;December, both in his first telegraphed report on arrival in Hobart, and in his fuller account, ''The South Pole''. Huntford, ''The Last Place on Earth'' (1985), p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt; five weeks ahead of a British party led by [[Robert Falcon Scott]] as part of the [[Terra Nova Expedition]]. Amundsen and his team returned safely to their base, and later learned that Scott and his four companions had died on their return journey.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16025">The '''Remote Associates Test''' ('''RAT''') is a [[creativity]] test used to determine a human's creative potential. The test typically lasts forty minutes and consists of thirty to forty questions each of which consists of three common [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] words that appear to be unrelated.  The person being tested must think of a fourth word that is somehow related to each of the first three words.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1433810|title=Review of Remote Associates Test|first1=Margaret E.|last1=Backman|first2=Bruce W.|last2=Tuckman|date=1 January 1972|publisher=|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|volume=9|issue=2|pages=161–162}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scores are calculated based on the number of correct questions.

==Development==
The Remote Associates Test (RAT), adult form was originally published in 1959, and then again in 1962, by [[Sarnoff A. Mednick|Professor Sarnoff Mednick]] and Martha T. Mednick.&lt;ref name="RATadult"&gt;Mednick, S. A., &amp; Mednick, M.T. (1959,1962). Remote Associates Test, college and adult form.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Mednick and Mednick published the high school form of the RAT.&lt;ref&gt;Mednick, S. A., &amp; Mednick, M.T. (1967). Remote Associates Test, high school form.&lt;/ref&gt; Mednick and Mednick defined the creative thinking process in the test manual as "the forming of associative elements into new combinations which either meet specified requirements or are in someway useful. The more mutually remote the elements of the new combination, the more creative the process or solution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mednick | first1 = S. A. | year = 1962 | title = The associative basis of the creative process | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 69 | issue = 3| pages = 220–232 | doi=10.1037/h0048850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baird, L.L. (1972). [Test review of Remote Associates Test]. In O. K. Buros (Eds.), ''The seventh mental measurements yearbook.''&lt;/ref&gt; Mednick reported a Spearman-Brown reliability of RAT=0.92 in one sample of students at an Eastern women’s college, and 0.91 in a sample of men tested at the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref name="RATadult" /&gt;

==Layout==
The two adult forms of the RAT consist of 30 items each. The respondent is allowed 40 minutes to complete the test. Each item provides three stimulus words that are remote from one another; the respondent is then required to find (via the creative process) another word that is a criteria-meeting mediating link, which can be associated with them all in a meaningful way. The test-taker's score is the number correct.&lt;ref name="RATadult" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed"

| Widow, Bite, Monkey || Bass, Complex, Sleep || Bald, Screech, Emblem || Room, Blood, Salts
|-
| Spider || Deep || Eagle || Bath 
|}

===Compound Remote Associates Test===
In Mednick’s two college-level versions of the test, each consisting of 30 items, each item can be associated with the solution word in a number of ways.&lt;ref name="Compound"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = C. S. | last2 = Huggins | first2 = A. C. | last3 = Therriault | first3 = D. J. | year = 2014 | title = A measure of creativity or intelligence? examining internal and external structure validity evidence of the remote associates test | url = | journal = Psychology of Aesthetics Creativity and the Arts | volume = 8 | issue = 4| pages = 446–460 | doi=10.1037/a0036773}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the three words same/tennis/head are associated with the solution match by means of [[synonymy]] (same = match), formation of a [[compound word|compound]] (matchhead), and [[semantic]]s association (tennis match). In 2003, Edward M. Bowden and Mark Jung-Beeman developed 144 compound remote associate problems, a subset of RAT problems, for their studies of insight problem solving. They wanted a greater number of problems than were available in the original RAT, and to present participants with a more consistent task – that the solution word would always be related to the stimulus words in the same way. They designed a set of problems to which the solution word was associated with all three words of the triad through formation of a compound word (or phrase) (e.g., age/mile/sand for the compounds [[stone age]], [[milestone]], and [[sandstone]] with the solution word stone). Solution words were never repeated or used as problem words; problem words were sometimes repeated. The problems can be divided into two types: [[homogeneous]], for which the solution word is a [[prefix]] (or [[suffix]]) to all three words of the problem triad, and [[heterogeneous]], for which the solution word is a prefix (or suffix) to at least one of the words of the triad and a suffix (prefix) to the other word(s) of the triad. The 144 problems were scored according to the time required to solve them and to the difficulty ratio. This compound RAT gives researchers a cohesive and [[operational|operational definition]] [[normative]] list, where subjects are able to solve tasks in less time. The increase in the task solving ratios also provides the test with stronger [[Reliability (psychometrics)|reliability]], but at the price of losing complexity and ending up with a less challenging test, in terms of creativity.&lt;ref name="Compound"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowden | first1 = E. | last2 = Jung-Beeman | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Normative data for 144 compound remote associate problems | url = | journal = Behavior Research Methods, Instruments, &amp; Computers | volume = 35 | issue = 4| pages = 634–639 | doi=10.3758/bf03195543}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowden"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowden | first1 = E. | last2 = Jung-Beeman | first2 = M. | year = 2003 | title = Aha! - insight experience correlates with solution activation in the right hemisphere | url = | journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review | volume = 10 | issue = 3| pages = 730–737 | doi=10.3758/bf03196539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
According to Mednick, the RAT could be used to test "all fields of creative endeavor" and suggest that those who excel on the RAT will be gifted creatively as well as in the [[science]]s.&lt;ref name="RATadult"/&gt; Mednick also suggested that this test be used to select students from lower-income families to be admitted to special [[educational programs]]. However there is no data that shows that students who have done well on the RAT excel in any particular subject leading to criticism of the validity of the RAT.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Worthen and Clark (1971)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1433966|title=Toward an Improved Measure of Remote Associational Ability|first1=Blaine R.|last1=Worthen|first2=Philip M.|last2=Clark|date=1 January 1971|publisher=|journal=Journal of Educational Measurement|volume=8|issue=2|pages=113–123|doi=10.1111/j.1745-3984.1971.tb00914.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the RAT measured sensitivity to [[language]] rather than creative potential. The correct response is often the most common response and does not link the other three words in any conceptual way. Worthen and Clark improved upon the RAT to create the Functionally Remote Associates Test (FRAT) that depends on functional relationships.

==Impact==
Despite the original intent for the RAT to be used as a measure of individual differences in associative ability, the RAT has fallen out of use as a self-standing test of creativity.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; This test has been used to assess a wider range of cognitive abilities thought to underline creative thinking.&lt;ref name="Aiello"&gt;Aiello, D.

Whether the RAT should be used and interpreted as a measure of associative processing, [[convergent thinking]] and/or creative thinking remains an [[Open problem|open question]] on both [[theoretical definition|theoretical]] and [[empirical evidence|empirical]] grounds.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; Currently, the debate surrounding the proper use of the RAT is difficult to determine in the absence of additional [[empirical research|empirical studies]] examining the internal and external structure of the RAT. Findings from one study&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt; provide evidence for the RAT as a convergent thinking test, but much still remains to be understood regarding potential subprocesses of convergent thinking theorized to be assessed by the RAT&lt;ref name="RATadult"/&gt; and how these processes are linked to actual creative behaviors.&lt;ref name="Lee"/&gt;

The first social maps date from the early 20th century. A recent example is the mapping of the residences of U.S. [[Facebook]] users and their social links [http://petewarden.typepad.com/searchbrowser/2010/02/how-to-split-up-the-us.html].

In ''marketing'' a '''social map''' is a visualized analysis of a [[digital identity]] of a person, brand or company. A social map shows exactly where a digital identity is created, formed or discussed and sets each element in context and proportions.

These social map created an intense discussion about [[Online reputation|digital reputation]] and digital identities. For companies a so-called Corporate Social Map is still very new and an unusual methodology, but also very effective and meaningful.

The '''Society for the History of Astronomy''' is an organisation based in the United Kingdom that promotes research into the history of astronomy. It publishes a research journal called ''The Antiquarian Astronomer'' and a regular ''Bulletin''.&lt;ref name="sha_website_about"&gt;{{cite web

==The Society==
The Society for the History of Astronomy was founded in 2002 to promote the study of the history of astronomy by hosting talks by members and publishing new research into the field. One main objective was to encourage research into past astronomers who have previously been neglected within the history of science.  Some of its members are professional historians of science but most are amateur historians.&lt;ref name="sha_website_about"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Orchiston | first = Wayne | title = Society for the History of Astronomy | journal = [[Journal of Astronomical History and Heritage]] | volume = 8  | issue = 2 | pages = 133–134 | publisher = James Cook University | location = Townsville | year = 2005 | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2005JAHH....8..133O | issn = 1440-2807 | bibcode=2005JAHH....8..133O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Honorary President is [[Allan Chapman (historian)|Dr Allan Chapman]] of Wadham College, Oxford. The honorary vice-presidents are [[Dr Michael Hoskin]] of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]], and 
[[Arnold Wolfendale|Sir Arnold Wolfendale, FRS]].
[[Sir Patrick Moore]] was an honorary vice-president until his death in 2012.

The Society hosts several one-day conferences at venues across the United Kingdom each year. A ''Bulletin'' is published twice yearly containing articles and news items about astronomical history. The Bulletin includes short reports of original research by members.&lt;ref name="sha_website_about"/&gt;

The society maintains a library of publications of importance to the history of science. It is known as the Sir Robert Ball Library and is located at the [[Birmingham and Midland Institute]] in central Birmingham.&lt;ref name="sha_website_library"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 14 September 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives of the Society are preserved at the Library of the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge]].

==Survey of Astronomical History==
One of the Society's major activities is organising a Survey of Astronomical History in the form of lists of historical astronomers and observatories in each of the old counties of Britain and Ireland. This has been motivated by a desire to promote research into local astronomical activities that have previously been neglected.&lt;ref name="sha_website_survey"&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 14 September 2015
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Antiquarian Astronomer''==
The Society publishes annually a refereed journal called ''The Antiquarian Astronomer'' containing new research into the history of astronomy, particularly articles written by members. Published papers have discussed activities in major observatories, scientific research by individuals of particular note, scientific instrument makers, and the activities of prominent amateur astronomers.&lt;ref name="sha_website_aa"&gt;{{cite web

Its current editor is [[Ian Ridpath]].

==''Society for the History of Astronomy Bulletin''==
The Society publishes an bi-annual ''Bulletin'' containing news relating to the study of the history of astronomy and the organisation's activities. The ''Bulletin'' also includes short research articles and notes by members. It was previously called ''News'' (editions 1–4, 2002–2004) and ''Newsletter'' (editions 5–17, 2004–2008).
Articles are indexed in the [[Astrophysics Data System|SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6215">The '''Vanishing Hand''' theory is a concept first conceived of by economist [[Richard Normand Langlois]].&lt;ref name=tech&gt;{{cite web| title =Technology and the Vanishing Hand| work =The Past Speaks| url =http://pastspeaks.com/2012/05/21/technology-and-the-vanishing-hand/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is an intentional play on both [[Adam Smith]]'s [[invisible hand]] and [[Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.|Alfred Chandler]]'s [[The Visible Hand: The Managerial Revolution in American Business|Visible Hand]].&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;

==Background==
In Smith's work, his invisible hand describes the self-regulating  behavior of the market.  In essence, this theory states that individual personal motivations lead to the most efficient allocation of resources and greatest overall benefit, even if those motivations were not in any way benevolent.  This is exemplified by relatively small firms operating with no market control.  Competition between buyers and sellers channels the [[profit motive]] causing competition to lead to socially desirable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya. Introduction. The Theory of Moral Sentiments. By Adam Smith. 6th ed. 1790. New York: Penguin, 2009. vii–xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;  During Smith's time and much after, this was a justification for a [[laissez-faire]] economy.  However, in Smith's day there were not several market forces that currently exist, such as large-scale industry, finance, and advertising.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olsen, James Stewart. Encyclopedia of the Industrial Revolution. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt;

The Visible hand, however, was believed by Chandler to have replaced the Invisible hand with middle management in the mid 19th century, which became “the most powerful institution in the American economy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-163250973.html |title=Harvard Business School Professor Alfred D. Chandler, Jr., Preeminent Business Historian, Dead at 88 |date=May 11, 2007 |publisher=AScribe {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, he states that the multi-unit business structure arose because administrative coordination could yield greater profits than market coordination, giving rise to managerial hierarchy and led to furthered growth and profit.  The rise of this new system yielded major sectors of the economy being dominated and altered the structure of markets, steering away from a competitive state and to an economy controlled by corporate managers.  In other words, the large scale industries arising began to provide larger social benefits due to managerial presence and long-term scope rather than perfectly competitive markets.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Alfred. ''The Visible Hand''. Belknap Press, 1977. {{ISBN|978-0674940529}}. Introduction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vanishing Hand theory==
Langlois intended to show that Chandler's theory was partially correct but needed some reevaluation.&lt;ref name=abs&gt;{{cite web| last =Langlois| first =Richard N.| title =The Vanishing Hand: the Changing Dynamics of Industrial Capitalism| work =Industrial and Corporate Change 12(2): 351-385| date =Apr 2003| url =http://web.uconn.edu/ciom/Abstract.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=org&gt;{{cite web| last =Langlois| first =Dick| title =More on Managerial Coordination and the Vanishing Hand| work =Organizations and Markets| date =Jul 3, 2010| url =http://organizationsandmarkets.com/2010/07/03/more-on-managerial-coordination-and-the-vanishing-hand/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vanishing Hand theory, as argued by Dick Langlois:

"One of my longest-running interests has been the relationship between economic change, including technological change, and the boundaries of the firm. In broad strokes, my story is this: when markets are thin and market-supporting institutions weak, technological change, especially systemic change, leads to increased vertical integration, since in such an environment centralized ownership and control may reduce “dynamic” transaction costs; but when markets are thick and market-supporting institutions well developed, technological change leads to vertical disintegration, since in that environment the benefits of specialization and the division of labor outweigh the (now relatively smaller) transaction costs of contracting. This latter scenario is what I called the Vanishing Hand. I recently ran across a new working paper by Ann Bartel, Saul Lach, and Nachum Sicherman, called “Technological Change and the Make-or-Buy Decision,” that supports the Vanishing Hand idea empirically."&lt;ref&gt;https://organizationsandmarkets.com/2012/05/18/vertical-disintegration-and-technological-change/&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the Vanishing hand theory states that initially the Visible hand is present as industries require managerial cooperation and vertical integration for long term growth, but eventually fades away to a more Invisible hand in which specialization allows for market forces to coordinate more effectively leading to a quasi-Smithian division of labor.&lt;ref name=abs/&gt; Temporary clusters of firms arose acting under Chandler's Visible hand process that would eventually be replaced by Smith's division of labor and thus Invisible hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =The vanishing hand: the changing dynamics of industrial capitalism| work =Industrial and Corporate Change | url =http://icc.oxfordjournals.org/content/12/2/351.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the large, vertically-integrated corporations of the past have broken up in recent years into more specialized firms due to the removal of barriers to trade, such as outsourcing.  Specifically it has once more become economically optimal to seek a division of labor, or seek [[vertical disintegration]], rather than integrate.&lt;ref name=tech/&gt;

As minimum efficient scale falls firms size should fall as well.  When firm size is viewed as firm activity undertaken, this holds true.&lt;ref name=org/&gt;  It is likely, therefore, that as integration becomes costlier in comparison to alternatives, large firms are more likely disintegrate to varying degrees and have a loosened managerial presence, although complete return to a Smithian market is unlikely.&lt;ref name=org/&gt;

'''''War in the Age of Intelligent Machines''''' (1991) is a book by [[Manuel DeLanda]], in which he traces the [[history of warfare]] and the [[history of technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|title=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAwAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54|date=June 1993|publisher=Educational Foundation for Nuclear Science, Inc.|page=54|issn=0096-3402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is influenced in part by [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1978) and also reinterprets the concepts of [[war machine]]s and the [[machinic phylum]], introduced in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'' (1980). Deleuze and Guattari appreciated Foucault's definition of philosophy as a "tool box" that was to encourage thinking about new ideas. They prepared the field for a re-appropriation of their concepts, for use in another context of the "same" concept, which they called "[[actualization]]". DeLanda drew on the concepts these authors put forth, to investigate the history of warfare and technology.

== A social history of technology and of warfare ==
DeLanda describes how social and economic formations influence war machines, i.e. the form of [[army|armies]], in each historical period. He draws on [[chaos theory]] to show how the [[biosphere]] reaches [[Technological singularity|singularities]] (or [[bifurcation theory|bifurcations]]) which mark [[self-organization]] thresholds where [[emergent properties]] are displayed and claims that the "mecanosphere", constituted by the machinic phylum, possesses similar qualities. He argues for example how a certain level of population growth may induce [[invasion]]s and others may provoke wars.

As a historian, DeLanda is indebted to the ''[[Annales School]]'' and the study of long-time historical phenomena, as opposed to human-scale phenomena. The next threshold point, or singularity, to be reached, according to DeLanda, is the point where man and machine cease to oppose themselves, becoming a war machine and when that war machine is crossed by the machinic phylum. It may result in erratic war machines that become [[nomadism|nomads]], because of a lack of political control. DeLanda writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''I defined the machinic phylum as the set of all the singularities at the onset of processes of self-organization — the critical points in the flow of matter and energy, points at which these flows spontaneously acquire a new form or pattern. All these processes, involving elements as different as molecules, cells or termites, may be represented by a few mathematical models. Thus, because one and the same singularity may be said to trigger two very different self-organizing effects, the singularity is said to be 'mechanism independent'''|DeLanda (p. 132) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Centralization and decentralization ==
According to DeLanda, centralization and decentralization are two trends in the "war machine": either military commanders try to [[centralization|centralize]] command and control of each event on the battlefield and get "human will out of the decision-making loop" or they delegate [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] to [[individual]] [[soldiers]] (e.g., [[platoons]] or the German [[mission-type tactics]]) to avoid "friction". "Friction", according to DeLanda, is like "[[noise]]" — too much friction blocks the war machine, which destroys itself. Thus, rather than waiting for friction to accumulate at the head of the [[Command, Control and Communications|control, command and communication]] center (C&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which is the case in centralized armies, decentralized war machines allow it to disperse at each level of the machine.

The 1805 [[Jacquard loom]], used holes punched in pasteboard [[punched cards]] to control the weaving of patterns in fabric and is the first example of a "migration" of human control to machine control and marks the invention of [[software]] according to DeLanda. [[Command and Control (Military)|Command and control]] techniques adapted by the Germans were then introduced in army [[arsenal]]s by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] and extended to civilian society: "the imposition of military production methods into the civilian society was accompanied by the transfer of a whole command and control grid." (p.&amp;nbsp;153) The system of [[Numerical control]] — and then the [[CNC]] — which was developed by funds from the US Air Force, "withdraws all control from workers in the area of weapons production and centralizes it at the top. But if the NC (and related methods) effectively shortened the chain of command be getting humans out of the decision-making loop, it also weakened the civilian sector of the economy by its adverse effects on workers' productivity," (p.&amp;nbsp;154) argues Manuel DeLanda. He thus underlines that the US has become a net importer of [[machine tools]] for the first time since the 19th century, and points out that while in 1975 all major manufacturers of [[integrated chips]] were American, in 1986 only two were not [[Japan]]ese. In 1982, the Japanese [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|MITI]] had launched the [[Fifth Generation Computer Systems project]] (FGCS) initiative to create computers supposed to perform much calculation utilizing [[Massively parallel (computing)|massive parallelism]].

According to DeLanda, the Prussian Army was thus [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Jominian]], that it favored centralized command of the battlefield and the conduct of military affairs over diplomacy and politics. He opposes [[Clausewitz]]'s classic theory exposed in ''[[On War]]'' (1832) of the primacy of politics over warfare (if strategy is the art of assembling battles, politics is the art of making sense of victories). Although DeLanda did not quote [[Sun Tzu]], his use of Clausewitz recalls the Sun's counsels on the way to avoid wars as being the most effective warfare: one may be sure he won the war when the war didn't happen. DeLanda claims that this Jominian theory influenced Prussian [[militarism]], the [[RAND Corporation]] and current [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] policies concerning [[research and development]]. This centralization always aims at taking out humans from the decision-making loop and is therefore closely linked to the evolution of technology — although a major thesis of DeLanda's book is that evolution of technology is neither good or bad, as [[technophiles]] and [[technophobes]] hope or fear. It may be used to keep the human will out of the loop or  prioritize cooperative behavior and decentralization: the classic example used is the [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers']] re-appropriation of the military [[ARPANET]] in the early ages of the [[Internet]].

Thus, the [[Schlieffen Plan]], formulated by the [[German general staff]] after the 1870–71 [[Franco-Prussian war]], is a good example of centralized war planning and of Jominian theory: everything was so rigidly planned that there was almost zero ability to adapt for sudden changes. When [[World War I]] started in August 1914, the military told the emperor that they could do nothing but invade France, although the emperor changed his mind, hoping that if he didn't invade France, Great Britain wouldn't enter the war (in virtue of the 1904 ''[[Entente cordiale]]'' agreement). But the plan was too rigid and didn't allow for modification, thus potentially becoming one of the indirect causes of the war (although it surely wasn't the only one: DeLanda, who begins his book quoting [[Fernand Braudel]], doesn't believe in [[unicausality]] or [[determinism]]).&lt;!--This is obsolete, if anything, decentralisation made the German army too quick to adapt too often.--&gt;

== Wargaming and game theory ==
DeLanda also shows how [[wargaming]], invented in the early 19th century by [[Prussia]]ns under the name of ''[[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]]'', has been used since that time for simulation of battles, in particular by the [[general staff]], which may be considered the "[[institution]]alized brain" of the [[armed forces]] — until their substitution by [[think tank]]s, the first one being the [[RAND Corporation]], charged with the elaboration of [[science policy]] in the frame of the [[military-industrial complex]]. [[Frederick the Great]] was fascinated with [[automaton]]s, as Foucault has shown and with [[miniature wargaming|miniature wargames]]. 19th century wargaming models, which benefited from progress in [[cartography]], was dependent on [[dice]] at the beginning to represent the effects of [[wikt:chaos|chaos]]. Eventually, these irrational conditions were taken out of the loop, as well as human will: current military wargames oppose computers, not human beings. It was shown during the [[nuclear arms race]] that human beings refused in game models to cross the threshold and press the red button, which convinced military programmers to take out human players.

DeLanda distinguishes various "ages" of war machines (although they probably don't succeed each other in a simple way; Foucault and Deleuze likewise cast in doubt such historical linear succession); he also defines various "levels" of war machines ([[Military tactics|tactics]], [[military strategy|strategy]] and [[logistics]], which necessarily involve [[politics]]).

Henceforth, describing the passage from the "[[clockwork]] paradigm" to the "[[engine|motor]] paradigm", he quotes [[Michel Serres]]'s studies to demonstrate how this new paradigm led to the creation of an "abstract motor" composed of three components: a reservoir (steam in the case of the [[steam engine]]), a form of exploitable difference (heat/cold) and a "diagram" or "program" for the exploitation of (thermal) differences. Michel Serres thus mentioned [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] as examples in the area of scientific [[discourse]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;''reservoirs of population, of capital or of unconscious desires, put to work by the use of differences of fitness, class or sex, each following a procedure directing the circulation of naturally selected species, or commodities and labor, or symptoms and fantasies....''|Serres (p.141)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus, [[Napoleon]]'s armies, born from the 1789 [[French Revolution]], marked a new threshold of the machinic phylum or singularities or bifurcation: [[emergent properties]] are displayed in this "evolution" from the "clockwork paradigm" to the "motor paradigm". This evolution is not merely technological; it is not so much the invention of the steam engine — the first type of motor — that determines this "evolution". The first steam engine was invented through [[tinkering]] and can thus not be said to be the consequences of a "[[paradigm shift]]" as [[Thomas Kuhn]] would conceive it. There is no necessary pre-eminence of science over technology (nor the reverse). De Landa thus explains that the "abstract motor" is more important than the "concrete motor", taking as his example the dazzling victories during the [[Napoleonic Wars]],

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''Napoleon himself did not incorporate the motor as a ''technical'' object into his war machine (as mentioned, he explicitly rejected the use of [[steamboats]]), but the abstract motor did affect the mode of assemblage of the Napoleonic armies: "motorized" armies were the first to make use of a reservoir of loyal human bodies, to insert these bodies into a flexible [[calculus]] ([[nonlinear]] tactics), and to exploit the friend/foe difference to take warfare from clockwork dynastic duels to massive confrontations between [[nations]].''|De Landa (p.141)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Napoleon's true innovation was not in the implementation of the motor invention — he rejected the use of steamboats — but his use of the pool of energy formed by [[patriotism]], itself fuelled by the [[French Revolution]]. This high [[morale]] made [[conscription]] possible; it also allowed more local initiative by and decentralization of the army, since French commanders didn't dread, as did their counterparts, endless cases of [[desertions]] if they allowed small groups of soldiers to take over specific missions.

DeLanda also notes how [[John von Neumann]] was hired by the RAND Corporation to improve [[war exercises]], which he did by devising [[game theory]], which helped [[The Pentagon]] think about [[nuclear strategy]]. In particular, game theory was used to represent the [[Cold War]] dualism conflict as an instantiation of the [[Prisoner's dilemma]]. Since the [[zero-sum fallacy]] wasn't yet thought, this led to [[systemic bias]] in favor of conflict against [[cooperative game]]s, according to de Landa. Thus, the [[massive retaliation]] nuclear strategy was chosen, although [[nuclear disarmament]] would have been, in a more realistic [[win-win game]], the best solution. The [[Turing machines]] were also perfect "abstract machines" which would be implemented in concrete machines only later.

He has introduced anthropological insights and themes to the history of medicine and science; developed innovative frameworks for the analysis of science and globalisation; and conducted historical research into the material cultures of scientific exchange. His influential formulation of the [[Postcolonialism|postcolonial studies]] of science and medicine has generated a new style of inquiry within [[science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Seth S. Putting knowledge in its place: science, colonialism, and the postcolonial, ''Postcolonial Studies'' Special Issue: Science, Colonialism, Postcolonialism 12(4): 373–83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==

Anderson was born and educated in [[Melbourne]], Australia, where he attended the [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]]. His father, Hugh McDonald Anderson (1927-2017), was a leading [[folklorist]] and historian of Australian popular and literary culture, with more than forty books to his credit; his mother, Dawn Anderson, has written books on drama education and creativity.

He graduated from the University of Melbourne Medical School (M.B., B.S. [equivalent to the US M.D.]) in 1983. During the medical course he conducted neurophysiology research, supervised by Ian Darian-Smith, which earned him the B.Med.Sc. (1980). He was an intern at the [[Royal Melbourne Hospital]], and had paediatric training at the Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, and the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford. In the 1986 season he was the assistant doctor for the [[Footscray Football Club]] (now the AFL Bulldogs). From 1987, he worked in general practice in the inner west of Melbourne, which he continued intermittently until 1999. 
 
Anderson ("Dr. Androgen") was a co-presenter on the award-winning radio program "Spoonful of Medicine" ([[3RRR]]) from 1987–88.

== Poetry ==

As a medical student, Anderson began writing and publishing poetry. More than forty poems have appeared in a range of leading journals in Australia and the US. His poetry collection, ''Hard Cases, Brief Lives'' (Adelaide: Ginninderra, 2011) was short-listed in 2012 for the Mary Gilmore Award of the Association for the Study of Australian Literature (ASAL).&lt;ref&gt;Anderson W. Hard Cases, Brief Lives [Poetry].

Retrieved 13 November 2–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of medicine and science ==

Anderson completed a PhD in the Department of the History and Sociology of Science at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1992. His dissertation was on US colonial medicine and public health in the [[Philippines]], and his advisor was [[Charles E. Rosenberg]]. Before moving to Sydney, Anderson held appointments at [[Harvard University]] (1992–95); the University of Melbourne (1995–2000); [[UCSF]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] (2000–2003); and the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] (2003–08). At Melbourne, he founded the Centre for Health and Society (1997)&lt;ref&gt;[http://chs.unimelb.edu.au/ "Melbourne School of Population and Global Health: Centre for Health and Society"], "University of Melbourne". Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to establish the Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit (1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onemda.unimelb.edu.au/ "Onemda VicHealth Koori Health Unit"], "University of Melbourne". Retrieved 18 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; At Madison, he was chair of the Department of Medical History and Bioethics.

He was the founding editor of ''Health and History'' (1998), and served as associate editor for the ''East Asian STS Journal'' and ''Postcolonial Studies''. He served on the councils of the American Association of the History of Medicine (AAHM), the Australian and New Zealand Society for the History of Medicine, the Australian Society of Health, Law and Ethics, History of Medicine in Southeast Asia (HOMSEA), the Institute of Postcolonial Studies (Melbourne), and the Pacific Circle.

Anderson was awarded a fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Foundation]] (2007–08), and he was a Frederick Burkhardt Fellow of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (2005–06), which he held at the [[Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton]]. In 2013 he was a Whitney J. Oates Fellow at the Humanities Council, Princeton University and a John Hope Franklin Fellow at Duke University.

It opened in the [[Neoproterozoic|Late Neoproterozoic]] and closed in the [[Paleozoic|Early Paleozoic]].]]
The '''Wilson cycle''' is a model where a [[continent]] [[rift]]s, forms an [[ocean basin]] in-between, and then begins a process of [[Convergent boundary|convergence]] that leads to the [[continental collision|collision]] of the two plates and closure of the ocean.  The model is named after its originator [[John Tuzo Wilson]]. It has been suggested that Wilson cycles on Earth started about 3 [[gigaannum|Ga]] (3 billion years) ago in the [[Archean|Archean Eon]] of Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shirey |first1=Steven B. |last2=Richardson |first2=Stephen H. |date=2011 |title=Start of the Wilson Cycle at 3 Ga Shown by Diamonds from Subcontinental Mantle |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/333/6041/434 |journal=Science |volume= 333 |issue= 6041 |pages=434-436 |doi= 10.1126/science.1206275  |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Wilson cycle is not the same as a [[supercontinent cycle]], which is the break-up of one [[supercontinent]] and the development of another and takes place on a global scale. The Wilson cycle rarely synchronizes with the timing of a supercontinent cycle.&lt;ref name='rogers'&gt;Rogers, John J.W., and M. Santosh. Continents and Supercontinents. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2004. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; However, supercontinent cycles and Wilson cycles were both involved in the creation of [[Pangaea]] and [[Rodinia]].&lt;ref name="flutaeu"&gt;Fluteau, Frédéric. (2003).
