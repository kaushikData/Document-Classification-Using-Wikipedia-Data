The '''A686''' is a road in [[Northern England]]. It runs from [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in [[Cumbria]] to [[Haydon Bridge]] in [[Northumberland]]. The [[The Automobile Association|AA]] named the A686 ''"One of the Greatest Drives in Britain"'' owing to the dramatic scenery of the [[Pennines]] hills encountered along its route. The road is popular with [[Motorcycling|motorbikers]], and due to the great number of steep bends many casualties occur along the road. It was recently{{when|date=November 2009}} voted 9th best drive in the country by [[Top Gear (magazine)|Top Gear]].{{citation needed|date=November 2009}}

==Route==
The A686 begins at a [[roundabout]] with the [[A66 road (Great Britain)|A66 road]] and [[A6 road (Great Britain)|A6 road]] on the edge of Penrith though it originally started in nearby [[Carleton village|Carleton]] at a crossroads with the former route of the A66. The road heads in a north-easterly direction crossing the [[River Eden, Cumbria|River Eden]] before going through the village of [[Langwathby]]. It continues through [[Melmerby, Cumbria|Melmerby]] and across the [[Pennines]] before reaching the isolated market town of [[Alston, Cumbria|Alston]].

It meets the [[A689 road]] (to [[Brampton, Carlisle, Cumbria|Brampton]] and [[Bishop Auckland]]) and then crosses the border into [[Northumberland]]. It continues past the villages of [[Ninebanks]], [[Bearsbridge]] and [[Whitfield, Northumberland|Whitfield]]. It meets the B6305 road to [[Hexham]], and {{convert|3.1|mi}} later terminates at its junction with the [[A69 road (Great Britain)|A69 road]] just east of Haydon Bridge.

==History of Bajío culture==
[[File:Bajío Norponiente mapa.png|thumb|480px|[[Bajío Occidente]] (West Bajio).]]
Recent archaeological studies of the Bajío have discovered an extensive, historic cultural tradition unique to the region, particularly along the flood plains of the [[Lerma River|Lerma]] and [[Laja River (Mexico)|Laja]] rivers. The Bajío Culture flourished from 300 to 650[[Common era|CE]], with cultural centers ranging from [[El Cóporo]] in the far north of Guanajuato to [[Plazuelas]] in the far south west. More than 1,400 sites have been discovered throughout the state of Guanajuato, with only the sites of [[Cañada de la Virgen]], El Cóporo, [[Peralta (Mesoamerican site)|Peralta]], and Plazuelas having received extensive study. This region was also known as [[La Gran Chichimeca]] in later years. It was the epicenter of the historic [[Chichimeca War]], the Northern Revolutionary States, and cradle of [[Mexican War of Independence]].

==Geography==
In general usage, the region is usually associated with the States of Guanajuato and Querétaro, although it only forms a part of them. It is characterized by its highly mechanized agriculture, with mean precipitation in the order of {{convert|700|mm|in}} per annum (one of the highest in the country). During the [[New Spain|Viceroyalty of New Spain]], the area was known as the breadbasket of the territory. As of 2014, the region produces [[sorghum]], [[wheat]] and [[maize]] as its main crops.

The Bajío region lies in the basin of the [[Rio Lerma]] and [[Río Grande de Santiago]].

==States==
The free and sovereign states of the Bajío are:

== Asian community ==
As of early 2014, there are more than three thousand [[Japanese immigration to Mexico|Japanese immigrants]] in the Bajío area, and it's claimed that this population is larger than the historical [[Japanese community in Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="Universal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eluniversalqueretaro.mx/metropoli/06-01-2014/3-mil-japoneses-en-queretaro |title=3 mil japoneses en Querétaro
 |publisher=El Universal |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guanajuato government believes that by 2016 there will be five thousand families living in the area.&lt;ref name="Financiero"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/queretaro-el-nuevo-territorio-japones.html |title=Querétaro, el nuevo territorio japonés
 |publisher= El Financiero |accessdate=October 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This immigration is being driven by foreign investment in the area, especially in the automotive sector.

By the end of 2014, it is expected that there will be 100 families settled in Querétaro. In the capital of Querétaro there are 50 Japanese restaurants, 15 of which opened in 2013, mainly in the area of [[Juriquilla]] and new shopping centers. There are also talks of the [[Liceo Mexicano Japonés]] opening a campus in Querétaro.&lt;ref name="Financiero" /&gt; ''Bajío Shimbun'' is a monthly, Japanese-language newspaper founded in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leoneses lanzan periódico en japonés|url=http://unionguanajuato.mx/articulo/2015/06/04/economia/leon/leoneses-lanzan-periodico-en-japones|publisher=Unión Guanajuato|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Japanese consulate in Mexico was inaugurated in January 2016 in León and will serve the Bajío region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japón abre consulado en León, Guanajuato|url=http://elfinanciero.com.mx/bajio/japon-abre-consulado-en-leon-guanajuato.html|publisher=El Financiero|accessdate=16 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, there were 1,143 Japanese in Aguascalientes, 43% of all foreigners in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japoneses en Aguascalientes y en la Región / El apunte - La Jornada Aguascalientes (LJA.mx)|url=http://www.lja.mx/2017/05/japoneses-en-aguascalientes-en-la-region-apunte/|website=La Jornada Aguascalientes (LJA.mx)|accessdate=14 July 2017|language=es-MX|date=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a [[Koreans in Mexico|Korean]] community in the area that is likewise growing as a result of foreign investment. As of 2014, it was more common to see Korean students in private schools than it was to see Japanese.&lt;ref name="Financiero" /&gt;

==High-speed rail in the Bajío==
There are plans to build a high-speed rail Querétaro-Mexico City system, which would continue to Guadalajara. It would work as the main form of transportation in all the Bajío and its capital cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/estados/2014/02/11/confirman-que-tren-df-queretaro-llegara-hasta-guadalajara|title=El Economista - Periódico especializado en economía, finanzas, negocios y política. Noticias de última hora, Foros, Blogs y mucho más.|website=eleconomista.com.mx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

The Bajío is known for being the cradle of Mexican Independence from [[Spanish Empire]] and one of the most conservative bastions of [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico|Mexican Catholicism]].

The Bajío is where in April 1915, during the [[Mexican Revolution]], General [[Álvaro Obregón]] provoked decisive battles against [[Pancho Villa]]. Villa's troops lost in June outside [[Celaya]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1337">The '''Chorobates''', described by [[Vitruvius]] in Book VII of the [[De architectura|Architecture]], was used to measure horizontal planes and was especially important in the construction of aqueducts.

Similar to modern [[spirit level]]s, the Chorobates consisted of a beam of wood 6 m in length held by 2 supporting legs and equipped with 2 plumb lines at each end. The legs were joined to the beam by two diagonal rods with carved notches.  If the notches corresponding to the plumb lines matched on both sides, it showed that the beam was level. On top of the beam, a groove or channel was carved.  If the condition was too windy for the plumb bobs to work effectively, the surveyor could pour water into the groove and measure the plane by checking the water level.

A '''county seat''' is an [[administrative center]], [[seat of government]], or [[capital city]] of a [[county]] or [[Parish (administrative division)|civil parish]]. The term is used in [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Romania]], [[Taiwan]] and the [[United States]]. [[County town]]s have a similar function in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland]], and historically in [[Jamaica]].

==Function==

In most of the United States, [[County (United States)|counties]] are the [[Political division|political subdivisions]] of a [[U.S. state|state]]. The city, town, or populated place that houses county government is known as the '''seat''' of its respective county. Generally, the county legislature, county courthouse, sheriff's department headquarters, hall of records, jail and correctional facility are located in the county seat though some functions may also be located or conducted in other parts of the county, especially if it is geographically large.

A county seat is usually, but not always, an incorporated municipality. The exceptions include the county seats of counties that have no incorporated municipalities within their borders, such as [[Arlington County, Virginia]] (where the county seat is the entire county&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Counties in Virginia and the Location of Their Seats of Government|url=http://www.dhcd.virginia.gov/CommissiononLocalGovernment/PDFs/county.seats.pdf|publisher=Virginia Commission on Local Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Ellicott City, Maryland|Ellicott City]], the county seat of [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]], is the largest unincorporated county seat in the United States, followed by [[Towson, Maryland|Towson]], the county seat of [[Baltimore County, Maryland]]. Likewise, some county seats may not be incorporated in their own right, but are located within incorporated municipalities. For example, [[Cape May Court House, New Jersey]], though unincorporated, is a section of [[Middle Township, New Jersey|Middle Township]], an incorporated municipality.  In some of the colonial states, county seats include or formerly included "Court House" as part of their name, (e.g. [[Spotsylvania Courthouse, Virginia]]).

==Taiwan==
[[File:苗栗市市街 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Miaoli City]], the county seat of [[Miaoli County]].]]
County seats in Taiwan are the administrative centers of the [[County (Taiwan)|counties]]. Currently there are 13 county seats in Taiwan, which are in the forms of [[county-administered city]], [[Township (Taiwan)|urban township]] or [[Township (Taiwan)|rural township]].

[[File:Renville County Courthouse MN.jpg|thumb|Many county seats in the United States feature a historic courthouse, such as this one in [[Renville County, Minnesota]], pictured in May 2015.]]

===U.S. counties with more than one county seat===
Most counties have only one county seat.  However, some counties in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Iowa]], [[Kentucky]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Vermont]] have two or more county seats, usually located on opposite sides of the county. An example is [[Harrison County, Mississippi]], which lists both [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]] and [[Gulfport, Mississippi|Gulfport]] as county seats. The practice of multiple county seat towns dates from the days when travel was difficult.  There have been few efforts to eliminate the two-seat arrangement, since a county seat is a source of pride (and jobs) for the towns involved.

There are 36 counties with multiple county seats (no more than two each) in 11 states:

===Other variations===

====New England====
In [[New England]], the town, not the county, is the primary division of local government. Historically, counties in this region have served mainly as dividing lines for the states' judicial systems.  [[Connecticut]] (since 1960) and [[Rhode Island]] have no county level of government and thus no county seats.  In [[Vermont]], [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIII/TitleII/Chapter231/Section82|title=MGL c. 231, s. 82|accessdate= 2013-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/33/title33sec701.html|title=Title 33, §701: Office in shire town|work=mainelegislature.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; the county seats are legally designated ''shire towns''. County government consists only of a [[Superior Court]] and [[Sheriffs in the United States|Sheriff]] (as an [[officer of the court]]), both located in the respective shire town. [[Bennington County, Vermont|Bennington County]] has two shire towns ([[Manchester, Vermont|Manchester]] for the ''North Shire'', [[Bennington, Vermont|Bennington]] for the ''South Shire''), but the Sheriff is located in Bennington. In [[Massachusetts]], most government functions which would otherwise be performed by county governments in other states are performed by town or city governments (there are no unincorporated areas in the state; that is, all land area in the state is within either a town or a city). As such, Massachusetts has dissolved many of its county governments, and the state government now operates the registries of deeds and sheriff's offices in those counties.

====Virginia====
In [[Virginia]], a county seat may be an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] surrounded by, but not part of, the county of which it is the administrative center; for example, [[Fairfax, Virginia|Fairfax City]] is both the county seat of [[Fairfax County]] and is completely surrounded by Fairfax County, but the city is politically independent of the county.

====South Dakota====
Two counties in [[South Dakota]] ([[Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota|Oglala Lakota]] and [[Todd County, South Dakota|Todd]]) have their county seat and government services centered in a neighboring county.  Their county-level services are provided by [[Fall River County, South Dakota|Fall River County]] and [[Tripp County, South Dakota|Tripp County]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Sdcounties&gt;{{cite web|last=Sdcounties.org|title= Shannon County, South Dakota|url= http://shannon.sdcounties.org/|accessdate= 10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Louisiana====
In [[Louisiana]], which is divided into [[List of parishes in Louisiana|parishes]] rather than counties, county seats are referred to as ''parish seats''.

====Alaska====
[[Alaska]] is divided into boroughs rather than counties; the county seat in these case is referred to as the "borough seat"; this includes six consolidated city-borough governments (one of which is styled as a "municipality"). The [[Unorganized Borough]], which covers 49% of Alaska's area, has no county seat or equivalent.

====Vermont and eastern Canada====
In the state of [[Vermont]] and the [[Canadian province]]s of [[Prince Edward Island]], [[New Brunswick]], and [[Nova Scotia]], the term "shire town" is used in place of county seat.

===Lists of U.S. county seats by state===
The state with the most counties is Texas, with 254, and the state with the fewest counties is Delaware, with 3.

[[Daylight saving time]] (DST) is observed in all ten [[Canada|Canadian]] provinces and three territories.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/eng/services/time/time_zones.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are  exceptions within several provinces and the territory of Nunavut, including most of [[Saskatchewan]], which observes [[Central Standard Time]] year-round even though the province is in the Mountain Zone, effectively putting it on DST year-round. Under the [[Canadian Constitution]], laws related to timekeeping are a purely provincial or territorial matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wiseman |first=Nelson |title=In Search of Manitoba's Constitutional Position, 1950–1990 |journal=Journal of Canadian Studies/Revue d'Études Canadiennes |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=85–107 |date=1994 |issn=0021-9495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In regions where daylight saving time is used, it commences on the second Sunday of March, and standard time restarts on the first Sunday in November. Daylight saving time lasts for a total of 34 weeks (238 days) every year, about 65% of the entire year.

==History==
[[Port Arthur, Ontario]], was the first municipality in the world to enact DST, on July 1, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernontario.travel/thunder-bay/the-thunder-bay-connection-to-daylight-savings-time|title=Time to change your clocks – but why?|date=March 8, 2018|work=Northern Ontario Travel|access-date=October 9, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five Canadian cities, by local ordinance, used daylight saving time before 1918: [[Brandon, Manitoba]] and [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg, Manitoba]] (already in 1916)&lt;ref name="Doane"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=pl&amp;id=AOE9AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=Brandon#search_anchor Doris Chase Doane, ''Time Changes in Canada and Mexico'', 2nd edition, Professional Astrologers, Inc., 1972 – 1975, p. 9, 23]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]]. [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's, Newfoundland]] (now Newfoundland and Labrador), which did not become part of Canada until 1949, also used DST before 1918.&lt;ref name="Doane" /&gt;

In practice, since the late 1960s DST across Canada has been closely or completely synchronized with its observance in the [[United States]] to facilitate consistent economic and social interaction. When the United States extended DST in 1987 to the first Sunday in April, all DST-observing Canadian jurisdictions followed suit to mimic the change.

The latest United States change ([[Energy Policy Act of 2005#Change to daylight saving time|Energy Policy Act of 2005]]), adding parts of March and November starting in 2007, was adopted by the various provinces and territories on the following dates:
* Ontario, Manitoba – October 20, 2005
* Quebec – December 5, 2005
* Prince Edward Island – December 6, 2005
* New Brunswick – December 23, 2005
* Alberta – February 2, 2006
* Northwest Territories – March 4, 2006
* British Columbia – March 31, 2006
* Nova Scotia – April 25, 2006
* Yukon – July 14, 2006
* Newfoundland and Labrador – November 20, 2006, but officially announced on January 18, 2007
* Nunavut – February 19, 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nnsl.com/nunavutnews/iqheds.html Nunavut News/North "Nunavut to follow new seasonal time standard" (unofficial, cached version)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329113214/https://www.nnsl.com/nunavutnews/iqheds.html |date=March 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Saskatchewan – no official action taken, as most of the province does not change their clocks back in winter, but the small parts that have historically observed DST near Alberta and Manitoba are presumed to be authorized to have the start and end dates the same as Alberta and Manitoba.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

==By province or territory==

===British Columbia===
Most of [[British Columbia]] (BC) is on [[Pacific Time Zone|Pacific Time]] and observes DST. However, there are two main exceptions:

* Part of the [[Peace River Regional District]] of BC (including the communities of [[Chetwynd, British Columbia|Chetwynd]], [[Dawson Creek]], [[Hudson's Hope]], [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]], [[Taylor, British Columbia|Taylor]] and [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]]) is on [[Mountain Time]] and does not observe DST. This means that the region's clocks are the same as those in [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] in the winter, they are the same as those in Vancouver in the summer. The residents of [[Fort Nelson, British Columbia|Fort Nelson]] have voted to also stay on year-round MST since 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reaburn |first=Adam |date=February 21, 2015 |url=http://energeticcity.ca/article/news/2015/02/21/fort-nelson-change-time-one-last-time-this-march |title=Fort Nelson to change time one last time this March |newspaper=Energeticcity.ca |access-date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[East Kootenay]] region of south-eastern BC (including the communities of [[Cranbrook, British Columbia|Cranbrook]], [[Fernie, British Columbia|Fernie]], [[Sparwood]], [[Golden, British Columbia|Golden]] and [[Invermere, British Columbia|Invermere]]) is on [[Mountain Time]] and observes DST. This means that the region is always on the same time as [[Calgary]]; much of the region gets television by way of rebroadcasters of Calgary stations. One exception in this region is [[Creston, British Columbia|Creston]], which observes MST year round.  Clocks in Creston match those in Calgary in the winter, and Vancouver in the summer.

===Nunavut===
While the rest of [[Nunavut]] observes DST, [[Southampton Island]] including [[Coral Harbour, Nunavut|Coral Harbour]] remain on Eastern Standard Time throughout the year. The [[Kitikmeot Region]] including [[Cambridge Bay, Nunavut|Cambridge Bay]] observes DST but is on Mountain Time. [[Eureka, Nunavut]], a permanent research station on [[Ellesmere Island]], also stays on Eastern Standard Time throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/visitor_guide_to_eureka_apr_2010.pdf|title=Visitor Guide to Eureka|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ontario===
Most of Ontario uses DST. [[Pickle Lake]], [[Atikokan]] and New Osnaburgh, three communities located within the Central Time Zone in [[northwestern Ontario]], observe [[Eastern Standard Time (North America)|Eastern Standard Time]] all year long.

===Quebec===
Most of Quebec observes DST. However, the eastern reaches of [[Quebec]]'s [[Côte-Nord|North Shore]], east of [[63rd meridian west|63° west longitude]], are in the Atlantic Time Zone, but do not observe DST (see exception, below). The effect is that in summer their clocks match those of the rest of the province, while in November, their clocks are rejoined by their Atlantic Standard Time neighbours. Although places east of 63° west are officially on Atlantic Time, local custom is to use Eastern Time as far east as the [[Natashquan River]]. Those communities observe DST, including all of [[Anticosti Island]], which is bisected by the 63rd meridian.

The [[Magdalen Islands]] observe Atlantic Time including DST.

===Saskatchewan===
{{main article|Time in Saskatchewan}}
Although the entire province is geographically within the MST ([[UTC-7]]) zone, the province is officially part of the Central time zone ([[UTC-6]]).  As a result, while most of Saskatchewan does not change clocks spring and fall, it technically observes DST year round.  This means that clocks in most of the province match clocks in [[Winnipeg]] during the winter and Calgary and Edmonton during the summer.  This time zone designation was implemented in 1966, when the Saskatchewan Time Act was passed in order to standardize time province-wide.

The charter of the city of [[Lloydminster]], which is bisected by the Saskatchewan–Alberta boundary, gives it a special exemption. Lloydminster and the immediately surrounding region in Saskatchewan observe Mountain Time year-round, with officially sanctioned seasonal daylight saving time (which in the summer, puts it in sync with the rest of Saskatchewan).  This is to keep clocks on the Saskatchewan side in sync with those on the Alberta side; Alberta mandates the use of daylight saving time province-wide.  Along the [[Manitoba]] border, the small, remote Saskatchewan towns of [[Denare Beach, Saskatchewan|Denare Beach]] and [[Creighton, Saskatchewan|Creighton]] unofficially observe Central Daylight Time during the summer, thereby keeping the same time as larger neighbouring Manitoba communities.

[[Laos]] is divided into 16 [[Provinces of Laos|provinces]] ([[Lao alphabet|Lao]]: ແຂວງ, ''[[khoueng]]'') and 1 prefecture (''kampheng nakhon'') plus capital city municipality (ນະຄອນຫລວງ, ''[[nakhon]] luang''). Furthermore, 1 so-called special administrative zone (ເຂດພິເສດ, ''[[khet phiset]]'') existed between 1994 and 2006, when it was re-merged into its surrounding provinces (i.e. Vientiane and Xiangkhoang). Each province is subdivided into districts ([[Lao alphabet|Lao]]: ເມືອງ, ''[[mueang]]'') and then subdivided into villages ([[Lao alphabet|Lao]]: ບ້ານ, ''baan'').

'''Ecological economics''' (also called '''eco-economics''', '''ecolonomy''' or '''bioeconomics''' of [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen|Georgescu-Roegen]]) is both a [[transdisciplinary]] and an [[interdisciplinary]] field of academic research addressing the interdependence and [[coevolution]] of human [[economy|economies]] and natural [[ecosystem]]s, both intertemporally and spatially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Anastasios Xepapadeas |year=2008 |url=http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/search_results?q=ecological+economics&amp;edition=current&amp;button_search=GO |title=Ecological economics |work=[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]] 2nd Edition |publisher=Palgrave MacMillan }}&lt;/ref&gt; By treating the economy as a subsystem of Earth's larger ecosystem, and by emphasizing the preservation of [[natural capital]], the field of '''ecological economics''' is differentiated from [[environmental economics]], which is the [[mainstream economics|mainstream economic]] analysis of the environment.&lt;!-- &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eoearth.org/article/Environmental_and_ecological_economics Lead Author: Robert Nadeau Article Topics: Ecological economics and Environmental economics Last Updated: August 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeroen C.J.M. van den Bergh (2001).

Ecological economics was founded in the 1980s as a modern discipline on the works of and interactions between various European and American academics (see the section on [[#History and development|History and development]] below). The related field of [[Green economy|green economics]] is, in general, a more politically applied form of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert C. Paehlke|Paehlke R.]] (1995).

According to ecological economist [[:de:Malte Michael Faber|Malte Faber]], ecological economics is defined by its focus on nature, justice, and time. Issues of [[intergenerational equity]], [[irreversibility]] of environmental change, [[uncertainty]] of long-term outcomes, and [[sustainable development]] guide ecological economic analysis and valuation.&lt;ref name=Faber2008&gt;Malte Faber. (2008). How to be an ecological economist. ''Ecological Economics'' '''66'''(1):1-7. [https://ideas.repec.org/p/awi/wpaper/0454.html Preprint].&lt;/ref&gt;  Ecological economists have questioned fundamental mainstream economic approaches such as [[cost-benefit analysis]], and the separability of economic values from scientific research, contending that economics is unavoidably [[Normative economics|normative]] rather than [[Positive economics|positive]] (i.e. descriptive).&lt;ref name=Victor2008&gt;Peter Victor.

==History and development==
The antecedents of ecological economics can be traced back to the [[Romantics]] of the 19th century as well as some [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] political economists of that era. Concerns over population were expressed by [[Thomas Malthus]], while [[John Stuart Mill]] predicted the [[Steady-state economy #John Stuart Mill's concept of the stationary state|desirability of the ''stationary state'' of an economy]]. Mill thereby anticipated later insights of modern ecological economists, but without having had their experience of the social and ecological costs of the [[Post–World War II economic expansion]]. In 1880, [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] economist [[Sergei Podolinsky]] attempted to theorize a [[labor theory of value]] based on [[embodied energy]]; his work was read and critiqued by [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bellamy Foster|first1=John|first2=Paul|last2=Burkett|title=Ecological Economics and Classical Marxism: The "Podolinsky Business" Reconsidered|journal=Organization &amp; Environment|date=March 2004|volume=Vol. 17, No. 1|pages=32-60|url=http://johnbellamyfoster.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2014/07/OandE-2004-Foster-Burkett-32-60.pdf|accessdate=31 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The debate on energy in economic systems can also be traced back to [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel prize]]-winning [[radiochemistry|radiochemist]] [[Frederick Soddy]] (1877–1956). In his book ''[[Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt]]'' (1926), Soddy criticized the prevailing belief of the economy as a perpetual motion machine, capable of generating infinite wealth—a criticism expanded upon by later ecological economists such as Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and Herman Daly.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/12/opinion/12zencey.html Zencey, Eric. (2009, April 12). Op-ed. ''New York Times'', p. WK9.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

European predecessors of ecological economics include [[K. William Kapp]] (1950)&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, K. W. (1950) ''The Social Costs of Private Enterprise''. New York: Shocken.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Polanyi]] (1944)&lt;ref&gt;Polanyi, K. (1944) ''The Great Transformation''. New York/Toronto: Rinehart &amp; Company Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Romania]]n economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] (1971). Georgescu-Roegen, who would later mentor Herman Daly at [[Vanderbilt University]], provided ecological economics with a modern conceptual framework based on the material and energy flows of economic production and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]]. His ''magnum opus'', ''[[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Magnum opus on The Entropy Law and the Economic Process|The Entropy Law and the Economic Process]]'' (1971), is credited by Daly as a fundamental text of the field, alongside Soddy's ''Wealth, Virtual Wealth and Debt''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Georgescu-Roegen |first=Nicholas |date=1971 |title=The Entropy Law and the Economic Process. |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/267519123/The-Entropy-Law-and-the-Economic-Process-by-Nicholas-Georgescu-Roegen-pdf |format=Full book accessible at Scribd |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0674257804 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key concepts of what is now ecological economics are evident in the writings of [[Kenneth Boulding]] and [[E.F. Schumacher]], whose book ''[[Small Is Beautiful]] &amp;ndash; A Study of Economics as if People Mattered'' (1973) was published just a few years before the first edition of [[Herman Daly]]'s comprehensive and persuasive ''[[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|Steady-State Economics]]'' (1977).&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, E.F. 1973.

Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first organized meetings of ecological economists occurred in the 1980s. These began in 1982, at the instigation of Lois Banner,&lt;ref&gt;Røpke, I. (2004) The early history of modern ecological economics. Ecological Economics 50(3-4): 293-314.&lt;/ref&gt; with a meeting held in Sweden (including [[Robert Costanza]], [[Herman Daly]], [[Charles A S Hall|Charles Hall]], Bruce Hannon, [[H.T. Odum]], and David Pimentel).&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory/&gt; Most were ecosystem ecologists or mainstream environmental economists, with the exception of Daly. In 1987, Daly and Costanza edited an issue of ''Ecological Modeling'' to test the waters. A book entitled ''Ecological Economics'', by [[Joan Martinez Alier|Juan Martinez-Alier]], was published later that year.&lt;ref name=EarlyHistory&gt;Costanza R. (2003). [http://www.ecoeco.org/pdf/costanza.pdf Early History of Ecological Economics and ISEE]. Internet Encyclopaedia of Ecological Economics.&lt;/ref&gt; 1989 saw the foundation of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] and publication of its journal, ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'', by [[Elsevier]]. [[Robert Costanza]] was the first president of the society and first editor of the journal, which is currently edited by Richard Howarth. Other figures include ecologists [[C.S. Holling]] and [[H.T. Odum]], biologist Gretchen Daily, and physicist [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. In the [[Marxian economics|Marxian]] tradition, sociologist [[John Bellamy Foster]] and CUNY geography professor [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] explicitly center ecological concerns in [[political economy]].

[[File:Diagram of natural resource flows.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2 |Natural resources flow through the economy and end up as waste and pollution]]

A simple [[circular flow of income]] diagram is replaced in ecological economics by a more complex flow diagram reflecting the input of solar energy, which sustains natural inputs and environmental services which are then used as units of [[Production (economics)|production]]. Once consumed, natural inputs pass out of the economy as pollution and waste. The potential of an environment to provide services and materials is referred to as an "environment's source function", and this function is depleted as resources are consumed or pollution contaminates the resources. The "sink function" describes an environment's ability to absorb and render harmless waste and pollution: when waste output exceeds the limit of the sink function, long-term damage occurs.&lt;ref name=Harris2006&gt;Harris J. (2006). ''Environmental and Natural Resource Economics: A Contemporary Approach''. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} Some persistent pollutants, such as some organic pollutants and nuclear waste are absorbed very slowly or not at all; ecological economists emphasize minimizing "cumulative pollutants".&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|28}} Pollutants affect human health and the health of the ecosystem.

The economic value of natural capital and [[ecosystem services]] is accepted by mainstream environmental economics, but is emphasized as especially important in ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|9}} Ecological economist [[Robert Costanza]] led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997.

The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in ''[[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]]'' Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|129}}

The Earth's [[carrying capacity]] is a central issue in ecological economics. Early economists such as [[Thomas Malthus]] pointed out the finite carrying capacity of the earth, which was also central to the MIT study ''[[Limits to Growth]]''. [[Diminishing returns]] suggest that productivity increases will slow if major technological progress is not made. Food production may become a problem, as [[erosion]], an impending [[water crisis]], and [[soil salinity]] (from [[irrigation]]) reduce the productivity of agriculture. Ecological economists argue that [[industrial agriculture]], which exacerbates these problems, is not [[sustainable agriculture]], and are generally inclined favorably to [[organic farming]], which also reduces the output of carbon.&lt;ref name=Harris2006/&gt;{{rp|26}}

Since [[animal]]s are higher on the [[trophic level]], they are less efficient sources of food energy. Reduced consumption of meat would reduce the demand for food, but as nations develop, they tend to adopt high-meat diets similar to that of the United States.

[[Global warming]] is now widely acknowledged as a major issue, with all national scientific academies [[scientific opinion on climate change|expressing agreement]] on the importance of the issue. As the population growth intensifies and energy demand increases, the world faces an [[energy crisis]]. Some economists and scientists forecast a global ecological crisis if energy use is not contained &amp;ndash; the [[Stern report]] is an example. The disagreement has sparked a vigorous debate on issue of [[discounting]] and intergenerational equity.

== Ethics ==
{{See also|Environmental ethics}}{{Renewable energy sources}}

[[Mainstream economics]] has attempted to become a value-free '[[hard and soft science|hard science]]', but ecological economists argue that value-free economics is generally not realistic. Ecological economics is more willing to entertain alternative conceptions of [[utility]], [[efficiency]], and [[cost-benefit analysis|cost-benefits]] such as positional analysis or multi-criteria analysis. Ecological economics is typically viewed as economics for [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;Soderbaum P. (2004).

=== Green economics ===
In international, regional, and national policy circles, the concept of the ''green economy'' grew in popularity as a response to the financial predicament at first then became a vehicle for growth and development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bina|first=O.|date=2011|title=Promise and shortcomings of a green turn in recent policy responses to the ‘double crisis’|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/geo2.36|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=70|pages=2308–2316|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[https://www.unenvironment.org/explore-topics/green-economy United Nations Environment Program]'' (UNEP) defines a ‘green economy’ as one that focuses on the human aspects and natural influences and an economic order that can generate high-salary jobs. In 2011, its definition was further developed as the word ‘green’ is made to refer to an economy that is not only resourceful and well-organized but also impartial, guaranteeing an objective shift to an [https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/126GER_synthesis_en.pdf economy that is low-carbon, resource-efficient, and socially-inclusive].

The ideas and studies regarding the green economy denote a fundamental shift for more effective, resourceful, environment-friendly and resource‐saving technologies that could lessen emissions and alleviate the adverse consequences of climate change, at the same time confront issues about resource exhaustion and grave environmental dilapidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janicke|first=M.|date=2012|title=‘Green growth’: from a growing eco‐industry to economic sustainability|url=|journal=Energy Policy|volume=28|pages=13-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indispensable requirement and vital precondition to realizing sustainable development, the [http://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/green_economy_in_action_eng.pdf Green Economy] adherents robustly promote good governance. To boost local investments and foreign ventures, it is crucial to have a constant and foreseeable macroeconomic atmosphere. Likewise, such an environment will also need to be transparent and accountable. In the absence of a substantial and solid governance structure, the prospect of shifting towards a sustainable development route would be insignificant. In achieving a green economy, competent institutions and governance systems are vital in guaranteeing the efficient execution of strategies, guidelines, campaigns, and programmes. 

Shifting to a Green Economy demands a fresh mindset and an innovative outlook of doing business. It likewise necessitates new capacities, skills set from labor and professionals who can competently function across sectors, and able to work as effective components within multi-disciplinary teams. To achieve this goal, vocational training packages must be developed with focus on greening the sectors. Simultaneously, the educational system needs to be assessed as well in order to fit in the environmental and social considerations of various disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2012.

=== Green politics ===

== Schools of thought ==
Various competing schools of thought exist in the field. Some are close to resource and environmental economics while others are far more heterodox in outlook. An example of the latter is the ''European Society for Ecological Economics''.  An example of the former is the Swedish ''Beijer International Institute of Ecological Economics.'' [[Clive Spash]] has argued for the classification of the ecological economics movement, and more generally work by different economic schools on the environment, into three main categories.  These are the mainstream new resource economists, the new environmental pragmatists,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clivespash.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Spash_NEP_2009_EV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the more radical social ecological economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clivespash.org/2011_Spash_AJES_Social_Ecol_Econ.pdf |title=Spash, C.L.

== Differentiation from mainstream schools ==
Some ecological economists prioritise adding natural capital to the typical [[capital asset]] analysis of land, labor, and financial capital. These ecological economists then use tools from [[mathematical economics]] as in mainstream economics, but may apply them more closely to the natural world. Whereas mainstream economists tend to be technological optimists, ecological economists are inclined to be technological sceptics. They reason that the natural world has a limited carrying capacity and that its resources may run out. Since destruction of important environmental resources could be practically irreversible and catastrophic, ecological economists are inclined to justify cautionary measures based on the [[precautionary principle]].&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R. (1989). What is ecological economics? ''Ecological Economics'' '''1''':1-7. [http://www.uvm.edu/giee/publications/Costanza_EE_1989.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The most cogent example of how the different theories treat similar assets is [[tropical rainforest]] ecosystems, most obviously the Yasuni region of [[Ecuador]].  While this area has substantial deposits of [[bitumen]] it is also one of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth and some estimates establish it has over 200 undiscovered medical substances in its genomes - most of which would be destroyed by logging the forest or mining the bitumen.  Effectively, the [[instructional capital]] of the genomes is undervalued by analyses which view the rainforest primarily as a source of wood, oil/tar and perhaps food. Increasingly the [[carbon credit]] for leaving the extremely carbon-intensive ("dirty") bitumen in the ground is also valued - the government of Ecuador set a price of US$350M for an oil lease with the intent of selling it to someone committed to never exercising it at all and instead preserving the rainforest.

While this natural capital and ecosystems services approach has proven popular amongst many it has also been contested as failing to address the underlying problems with mainstream economics, growth, market capitalism and monetary valuation of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, J., 1994. Ecological economics and ecosocialism, in: O'Connor, M. (Ed.), Is Capitalism Sustainable? Guilford Press, New York, pp. 23-36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spash, C.L., Clayton, A.M.H., 1997.

Ecological Economics 25, 57-60&lt;/ref&gt;  Critiques concern the need to create a more meaningful relationship with Nature and the non-human world than evident in the instrumentalism of shallow ecology and the environmental economists [[commodification]] of everything external to the market system.&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, J.F., 1993.

Ambio 26, 546-550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vatn, A., 2000. The environment as commodity. Environmental Values 9, 493-509&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
Among the topics addressed by ecological economics are methodology, allocation of resources, weak versus strong sustainability, energy economics, energy accounting and balance, environmental services, cost shifting, and modeling.

=== Methodology ===
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Laws of thermodynamics]]}}
A primary objective of ecological economics (EE) is to ground economic thinking and practice in physical reality, especially in the laws of physics (particularly the [[laws of thermodynamics]]) and in knowledge of biological systems.  It accepts as a goal the improvement of human well-being through development, and seeks to ensure achievement of this through planning for the sustainable development of ecosystems and societies. Of course the terms development and sustainable development are far from lacking controversy. [[Richard B. Norgaard]] argues traditional economics has hi-jacked the development terminology in his book ''Development Betrayed''.&lt;ref&gt;Norgaard, R. B. (1994) Development Betrayed: The End of Progress and a Coevolutionary Revisioning of the Future. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-being in ecological economics is also differentiated from welfare as found in mainstream economics and the 'new welfare economics' from the 1930s which informs resource and environmental economics.  This entails a limited preference utilitarian conception of value i.e., Nature is valuable to our economies, that is because people will pay for its services such as clean air, clean water, encounters with wilderness, etc.

Ecological economics is distinguishable from [[neoclassical economics]] primarily by its assertion that the economy is embedded within an environmental system. Ecology deals with the energy and matter transactions of life and the Earth, and the human economy is by definition contained within this system. Ecological economists argue that [[neoclassical economics]] has ignored the environment, at best considering it to be a subset of the human economy.

The neoclassical view ignores much of what the natural sciences have taught us about the contributions of nature to the creation of wealth e.g., the planetary endowment of scarce matter and energy, along with the complex and biologically diverse ecosystems that provide goods and [[ecosystem services]] directly to human communities: micro- and macro-climate regulation, water recycling, water purification, storm water regulation, waste absorption, food and medicine production, pollination, protection from solar and cosmic radiation, the view of a starry night sky, etc.

There has then been a move to regard such things as [[natural capital]] and ecosystems functions as goods and services.&lt;ref&gt;Daily, G.C. 1997. ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems''. Washington, D.C.: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. 2005. ''Ecosystems and Human Well-Being: Biodiversity Synthesis''. Washington, D.C.: World Resources Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this is far from uncontroversial within ecology or ecological economics due to the potential for narrowing down values to those found in mainstream economics and the danger of merely regarding Nature as a commodity.  This has been referred to as ecologists 'selling out on Nature'.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley, D. J. (2006) Selling out on nature. Nature 443(7): 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;  There is then a concern that ecological economics has failed to learn from the extensive literature in [[environmental ethics]] about how to structure a plural value system.

=== Allocation of resources ===
[[File:Uneconomic Growth diagram.jpg|thumb|The marginal costs of a growing economy may gradually exceed the marginal benefits, however measured.]]
[[Resource economics|Resource]] and [[neoclassical economics]] focus primarily on the efficient allocation of resources and less on the two other problems of importance to ecological economics: [[Distribution (economics)|distribution]] ([[equity (economics)|equity]]), and the scale of the economy relative to the ecosystems upon which it relies.&lt;ref name="Daly"&gt;Daly, H. and Farley, J. 2004. ''Ecological Economics: Principles and Applications''. Washington: Island Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological economics makes a clear distinction between growth (quantitative increase in economic output) and development (qualitative improvement of the [[quality of life]]), while arguing that [[neoclassical economics]] confuses the two. Ecological economists point out that beyond modest levels, increased per-capita [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] (the typical economic measure of "standard of living") may not always lead to improvement in human well-being, but may have harmful effects on the environment and broader societal well-being. This situation is sometimes referred to as [[uneconomic growth]] (see diagram above).

&lt;/imagemap&gt;

Ecological economics challenges the conventional approach towards natural resources, claiming that it undervalues natural capital by considering it as interchangeable with human-made capital—labor and technology.

The impending depletion of natural resources and increase of climate-changing greenhouse gasses should motivate us to examine how political, economic and social policies can benefit from alternative energy. Shifting dependence on fossil fuels with specific interest within just one of the above-mentioned factors easily benefits at least one other. For instance, photo voltaic (or solar) panels have a 15% efficiency when absorbing the sun's energy, but its construction demand has increased 120% within both commercial and residential properties. Additionally, this construction has led to a roughly 30% increase in work demands (Chen).

The potential for the substitution of man-made capital for natural capital is an important debate in ecological economics and the economics of sustainability.
There is a continuum of views among economists between the strongly neoclassical positions of [[Robert Solow]] and [[Martin Weitzman]], at one extreme and the [[Pessimism #Entropy pessimism|'entropy pessimists']], notably [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]] and [[Herman Daly]], at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 2007. On the practical limits of substitution. Ecological Economics 61: 115-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neoclassical economists tend to maintain that man-made capital can, in principle, replace all types of natural capital.  This is known as the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|weak sustainability]] view, essentially that every technology can be improved upon or replaced by innovation, and that there is a substitute for any and all scarce materials.

At the other extreme, the [[Strong vs Weak sustainability|strong sustainability]] view argues that the stock of natural resources and ecological functions are irreplaceable.  From the premises of strong sustainability, it follows that [[economic policy]] has a [[fiduciary]] responsibility to the greater ecological world, and that sustainable development must therefore take a different approach to valuing natural resources and ecological functions.

Recently, Stanislav Shmelev developed a new methodology for the assessment of progress at the macro scale based on multi-criteria methods, which allows consideration of different perspectives, including strong and weak sustainability or conservationists vs industrialists and aims to search for a 'middle way' by providing a strong neo-Keynesian economic push without putting excessive pressure on the natural resources, including water or producing emissions, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;Shmelev, S.E. 2012.

=== Energy economics ===
[[File:Cost and exergy for heating energy in Finland.jpg|thumb|275px|Exergy analysis can be performed to find connections between economic value and the physical world.

{{Main article|Energy economics}}
A key concept of energy economics is [[net energy gain]], which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce.  To be useful the energy return on energy invested (''[[EROEI]]'') has to be greater than one.  The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Energy and Resource Quality: The ecology of the Economic Process |last1=Hall |first1=Charles A.S. |authorlink=

Ecological economics generally rejects the view of [[energy economics]] that growth in the energy supply is related directly to well being, focusing instead on [[biodiversity]] and [[creativity]] - or natural capital and [[individual capital]], in the terminology sometimes adopted to describe these economically. In practice, ecological economics focuses primarily on the key issues of [[uneconomic growth]] and [[quality of life]]. Ecological economists are inclined to acknowledge that much of what is important in human well-being is not analyzable from a strictly economic standpoint and suggests an interdisciplinary approach combining social and natural sciences as a means to address this.

[[Thermoeconomics]] is based on the proposition that the role of energy in [[biological evolution]] should be defined and understood through the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but also in terms of such economic criteria as [[productivity]], [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]], and especially the costs and benefits (or profitability) of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter A. Corning]] 1 *, Stephen J. Kline. (2000). [http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/71007254/ABSTRACT Thermodynamics, information and life revisited, Part II: Thermoeconomics and Control information ] Systems Research and Behavioral Science, Apr. 07, Volume 15, Issue 6, Pages 453 – 482&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Corning|Corning, P.]] (2002). “[http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html Thermoeconomics – Beyond the Second Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922072349/http://www.complexsystems.org/abstracts/thermoec.html |date=2008-09-22 }}” – source: www.complexsystems.org&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermoeconomics is often discussed in the field of ecological economics, which itself is related to the fields of sustainability and sustainable development.

[[Exergy]] analysis is performed in the field of [[industrial ecology]] to use energy more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://exergy.se/goran/thesis/ |title=Exergy - a useful concept |author=Wall, Göran |publisher=Exergy.se |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''exergy'', was coined by [[Zoran Rant]] in 1956, but the concept was developed by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]]. In recent decades, utilization of exergy has spread outside of physics and engineering to the fields of industrial ecology, ecological economics, [[systems ecology]], and [[energetics]].

=== Energy accounting and balance ===
{{See also|Net energy gain}}

An [[Energy accounting|energy balance]] can be used to track energy through a system, and is a very useful tool for determining resource use and environmental impacts, using the First and Second laws of [[thermodynamics]], to determine how much energy is needed at each point in a system, and in what form that energy is a cost in various environmental issues.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Cutler" /&gt; --&gt; The energy accounting system keeps track of energy in, energy out, and non-useful energy versus [[work done]], and transformations within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |title=Environmental Decision making, Science and Technology |publisher=Telstar.ote.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105164509/http://telstar.ote.cmu.edu/environ/m3/s3/05account.shtml |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientists have written and speculated on different aspects of energy accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Stabile, Donald R.

=== Ecosystem services and their valuation ===
{{see also|Ecosystem valuation|Price of life}}
Ecological economists agree that ecosystems produce enormous flows of goods and services to human beings, playing a key role in producing well-being. At the same time, there is intense debate about how and when to place values on these benefits&lt;ref&gt; Farley, Joshua. "Ecosystem services: The economics debate." Ecosystem services 1.1 (2012): 40-49. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2012.07.002 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kallis, Giorgos, Erik Gómez-Baggethun, and Christos Zografos. "To value or not to value? That is not the question." Ecological economics 94 (2013): 97-105. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2013.07.002&lt;/ref&gt;.

A study was carried out by Costanza and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Costanza, R. |author2=d'Arge, R. |author3=de Groot, R. |author4=Farber, S. |author5=Grasso, M. |author6=Hannon, B. |author7=Naeem, S. |author8=Limburg, K. |author9=Paruelo, J. |author10=O'Neill, R.V. |author11=Raskin, R. |author12=Sutton, P. |author13=and van den Belt, M. |year=1997 |title=The value of the world's ecosystem services and natural capital |journal=Nature |volume=387 |issue=6630 |pages=253–260 |url=http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |doi=10.1038/387253a0 |bibcode=1997Natur.387..253C |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730185431/http://www.esd.ornl.gov/benefits_conference/nature_paper.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the 'value' of the services provided by the environment. This was determined by averaging values obtained from a range of studies conducted in very specific context and then transferring these without regard to that context.  Dollar figures were averaged to a per hectare number for different types of ecosystem e.g. wetlands, oceans. A total was then produced which came out at 33 trillion US dollars (1997 values), more than twice the total [[GDP]] of the world at the time of the study.  This study was criticized by pre-ecological and even some [[Environmental economics|environmental economists]] - for being inconsistent with assumptions of [[financial capital]] [[valuation (finance)|valuation]] - and ecological economists - for being inconsistent with an ecological economics focus on biological and physical indicators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Norgaard, R.B.  |author2=Bode, C. |year=1998|title= Next, the value of God, and other reactions|journal=Ecological Economics|volume= 25|pages= 37–39|doi=10.1016/s0921-8009(98)00012-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reducing human bodies to financial values is a necessary part of mainstream economics and not always in the direct terms of [[insurance]] or [[wages]].  Economics, in principle, assumes that conflict is reduced by agreeing on voluntary contractual relations and prices instead of simply fighting or coercing or tricking others into providing goods or services.  In doing so, a provider agrees to surrender time and take bodily risks and other (reputation, financial) risks.  Ecosystems are no different from other bodies economically except insofar as they are far less replaceable than typical labour or commodities.

Despite these issues, many ecologists and conservation biologists are pursuing [[ecosystem valuation]]. [[Biodiversity]] measures in particular appear to be the most promising way to reconcile financial and ecological values, and there are many active efforts in this regard.  The growing field of [[biodiversity finance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 SocialEdge.org.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215083840/http://www.socialedge.org/features/opportunities/archive/2008/02/23/weblogentry.2008-02-20.6191038944 |date=2009-02-15 }} Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; began to emerge in 2008 in response to many specific proposals such as the Ecuadoran Yasuni proposal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621054850/http://www.sosyasuni.org/en/News/Ecuadors-Oil-Change-An-Exporters-Historic-Proposal.html|date=June 21, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multinationalmonitor.org/mm2007/092007/koenig.html Multinational Monitor, 9/2007.] Accessed: December 23, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; or similar ones in the [[Republic of the Congo|Congo]].  US news outlets treated the stories as a "threat"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/ |title=Ecuador threat to drill jungle oil|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218035742/http://www.cnn.com/2007/BUSINESS/12/10/ecuador.oil.ap/|archivedate=December 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "drill a park"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=3980994 |title=International News &amp;#124; World News - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting a previously dominant view that NGOs and governments had the primary responsibility to protect ecosystems.  However [[Peter Barnes (entrepreneur)|Peter Barnes]] and other commentators have recently argued that a guardianship/trustee/commons model is far more effective and takes the decisions out of the political realm.

Commodification of other ecological relations as in [[carbon credit]] and direct payments to farmers to preserve [[ecosystem services]] are likewise examples that enable private parties to play more direct roles protecting biodiversity, but is also controversial in ecological economics&lt;ref&gt;Spash, Clive L. "The brave new world of carbon trading." New Political Economy 15.2 (2010): 169-195 &lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] achieved near-universal agreement in 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna.org/jt/agAssessment |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621193253/http://www.panna.org/jt/AgAssessment |archivedate=2008-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that such payments directly valuing ecosystem preservation and encouraging [[permaculture]] were the only practical way out of a food crisis.  The holdouts were all English-speaking countries that export [[GMO]]s and promote "[[free trade]]" agreements that facilitate their own control of the world transport network: The US, UK, Canada and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2008/04/17/do1702.xml | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=GM crops can save us from food shortages | first=Bill | last=Emmott | date=April 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Not 'externalities', but cost shifting ===

Ecological economics is founded upon the view that the neoclassical economics (NCE) assumption that environmental and community costs and benefits are mutually canceling ''"[[externalities]]"'' is not warranted. [[Joan Martinez Alier]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Costanza|first=Robert|title=Getting Down to Earth: Practical Applications of Ecological Economics|year=1996|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=1559635037|author2=Segura, Olman |author3=Olsen, Juan Martinez-Alier }}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance shows that the bulk of consumers are automatically excluded from having an impact upon the prices of commodities, as these consumers are future generations who have not been born yet.  The assumptions behind future discounting, which assume that future goods will be cheaper than present goods, has been criticized by David Pearce&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, David "Blueprint for a Green Economy"&lt;/ref&gt; and by the recent [[Stern Report]] (although the Stern report itself does employ discounting and has been criticized for this and other reasons by ecological economists such as [[Clive Spash]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |title=Spash, C. L. (2007) The economics of climate change impacts à la Stern: Novel and nuanced or rhetorically restricted? Ecological Economics 63(4): 706-713 |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202105133/http://www.clivespash.org/EE2007_SpashonStern.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning these externalities, some like the eco-businessman [[Paul Hawken]] argue an orthodox economic line that the only reason why goods produced unsustainably are usually cheaper than goods produced sustainably is due to a hidden subsidy, paid by the non-monetized human environment, community or future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul (1994) "The Ecology of Commerce" (Collins)&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments are developed further by Hawken, Amory and Hunter Lovins to promote their vision of an environmental capitalist utopia in ''[[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul; Amory and Hunter Lovins (2000) "Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution" (Back Bay Books)&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ecological economists, like Joan Martinez-Alier, appeal to a different line of reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;Martinez-Alier, Joan (2002) The Environmentalism of the Poor: A Study of Ecological Conflicts and Valuation. Cheltenham, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than assuming some (new) form of capitalism is the best way forward, an older ecological economic critique questions the very idea of internalizing externalities as providing some corrective to the current system. The work by [[Karl William Kapp]] explains why the concept of "externality" is a misnomer.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1963) The Social Costs of Business Enterprise. Bombay/London, Asia Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact the modern business enterprise operates on the basis of shifting costs onto others as normal practice to make profits.&lt;ref&gt;Kapp, Karl William (1971) Social costs, neo-classical economics and environmental planning. The Social Costs of Business Enterprise, 3rd edition. K. W. Kapp. Nottingham, Spokesman: 305-318&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Eisenstein]] has argued that this method of privatising profits while socialising the costs through externalities, passing the costs to the community, to the natural environment or to future generations is inherently destructive.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein , Charles (2011), "Sacred Economics: Money, Gift and Society in an Age in Transition" (Evolver Editions)&lt;/ref&gt; As social ecological economist [[Clive Spash]] has noted, externality theory fallaciously assumes environmental and social problems are minor aberrations in an otherwise perfectly functioning efficient economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Spash, Clive L. |date= 16 July 2010 |title= The brave new world of carbon trading |journal= New Political Economy |volume= 15 |pages=169–195 |publisher= Taylor and Francis Online |issue= 2 |doi= 10.1080/13563460903556049 |url= http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/19114/1/MPRA_paper_19114.pdf }} Copy also available at {{cite web|url=http://www.clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510185658/http://clivespash.org/2010_Spash_Brave_New_World_NPE.pdf |archivedate=2013-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Internalizing the odd externality does nothing to address the structural systemic problem and fails to recognize the all pervasive nature of these supposed 'externalities'.

=== Ecological-economic modeling ===

[[Mathematical model]]ing is a powerful tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include:&lt;ref&gt;Proops, J., and Safonov, P. (eds.) (2004), [http://www.e-elgar.co.uk/bookentry_main.lasso?id=2951 Modelling in Ecological Economics], Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faucheux, S., Pearce, D., and Proops, J. (eds.) (1995), Models of Sustainable Development, Edward Elgar&lt;/ref&gt; [[evolutionary]], [[input/output model|input-output]], neo-Austrian modeling, [[entropy]] and [[thermodynamic]] models,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[multi-criteria decision analysis|multi-criteria]], and [[agent-based]] modeling, the environmental [[Kuznets curve]], and [[Stock-Flow consistent model]] frameworks. [[System dynamics]] and [[GIS]] are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R., and Voinov, A. (eds.) (2004), Landscape Simulation Modeling.  A Spatially Explicit, Dynamic Approach, Springer-Verlag New-York, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voinov|first=Alexey|title=Systems science and modeling for ecological economics|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=0080886175|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Matrix accounting methods of Christian Felber provide a more sophisticated method for identifying "the common good"&lt;ref&gt;Felber, Christian (2012), "La economia del bien commun" (Duestro)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Assigning monetary value to natural resources such as [[biodiversity]], and the emergent [[ecosystem services]] is often viewed as a key process in influencing economic practices, policy, and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Mace GM. Whose conservation? Science (80- ). 2014 Sep 25;345(6204):1558–60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dasgupta P. Nature’s role in sustaining economic development. Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci. 2010 Jan 12;365(1537):5–11.&lt;/ref&gt; While this idea is becoming more and more accepted among ecologists and conservationist, some argue that it is inherently false.
 
McCauley argues that ecological economics and the resulting ecosystem service based conservation can be harmful.&lt;ref&gt;McCauley D. Selling out on nature. Nature. 2006;443(September):7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes four main problems with this approach:

Firstly, it seems to be assumed that all ecosystem services are financially beneficial. This is undermined by a basic characteristic of ecosystems: they do not act specifically in favour of any single species. While certain services might be very useful to us, such as [[coastal protection]] from [[hurricanes]] by [[mangrove]]s for example, others might cause financial or personal harm, such as wolves hunting [[cattle]].&lt;ref&gt;Mech LD. The Challenge and Opportunity of Recovering Wolf Populations. Conserv Biol. 1995 Apr;9(2):270–8&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of Eco-systems makes it challenging to weigh up the value of a given species. Wolves play a critical role in regulating prey populations; the absence of such an apex predator in the Scottish Highlands has caused the over population of deer, preventing afforestation, which increases the risk of flooding and damage to property.
 
Secondly, allocating monetary value to nature would make its conservation reliant on markets that fluctuate. This can lead to [[devaluation]] of services that were previously considered financially beneficial. Such is the case of the bees in a forest near former [[coffee plantation]]s in Finca Santa Fe, [[Costa Rica]]. The [[pollination]] services were valued to over US$60,000 a year, but soon after the study, coffee prices dropped and the fields were replanted with pineapple.&lt;ref&gt;Ricketts TH, Daily GC, Ehrlich PR, Michener CD. Economic value of tropical forest to coffee production. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2004 Aug 24;101(34):12579–82&lt;/ref&gt; Pineapple does not require bees to be pollinated, so the value of their service dropped to zero.

Thirdly, conservation programmes for the sake of financial benefit underestimate human ingenuity to invent and replace ecosystem services by artificial means. McCauley argues that such proposals are deemed to have a short lifespan as the history of [[technology]] is about how Humanity developed [[artificial]] alternatives to nature’s services and with time passing the cost of such services tend to decrease. This would also lead to the devaluation of [[ecosystem services]].

Lastly, it should not be assumed that conserving ecosystems is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration. In the case of the introduction of the [[Nile perch]] to [[Lake Victoria]], the ecological consequence was decimation of native [[fauna]]. However, this same event is praised by the local communities as they gain significant financial benefits from trading the fish.

McCauley argues that, for these reasons, trying to convince decision-makers to conserve nature for [[monetary]] reasons is not the path to be followed, and instead appealing to morality is the ultimate way to campaign for the protection of nature.

The '''Ecomuseum Zoo''' ({{lang-fr|Zoo Ecomuseum}}) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[zoo|zoological park]] in [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]], [[Quebec]] and was founded in 1988. It is accredited by the [[Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums|Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (CAZA). It occupies {{convert|11.3|ha}} of land on the western tip of the [[Island of Montreal]].&lt;ref name="OurZoo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecomuseum.ca/en/about-us/our-zoo-in-the-city|title=Our Zoo in the City|year=2011|publisher=Ecomuseum Zoo|accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ecomuseum is home to 115 different species of animal native to the [[Saint Lawrence Valley]] in southwestern Quebec.&lt;ref name="Animals" /&gt; The Ecomuseum is operated by the ''Saint-Lawrence Valley Natural History Society'' and opened in 1988.&lt;ref name="Whatwedo" /&gt;

==History==

Dr. John Roger Bider founded the St. Lawrence Valley Natural History Society in 1981 to help educate children about the environment. In 1988, the society opened the Ecomuseum on {{Convert|11.3|ha}} of land that had originally been wetland, but had then been used in the 1960s as landfill.&lt;ref name="OurHistory"/&gt;

The first education programs on the site were offered in 1989. The first building on the site, for administration and education, was opened in 1992. Ecomuseum opened in the winter for the first time in 1996.&lt;ref name="OurHistory"/&gt;

'''Epirus''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|p|aɪ|r|ə|s}}) is a [[Region#Geographical regions|geographical]] and [[Region#Historical regions|historical]] region in southeastern Europe, now shared between [[Greece]] and [[Albania]]. It lies between the [[Pindus Mountains]] and the [[Ionian Sea]], stretching from the [[Bay of Vlorë]] and the [[Ceraunian Mountains|Acroceraunian mountains]] in the north to the [[Ambracian Gulf]] and the ruined [[Roman Empire|Roman]] city of [[Nicopolis]] in the south.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD527"&gt;{{harvnb|Hornblower|Spawforth|Eidinow|2012|loc="Epirus", p. 527}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently divided between the [[Modern regions of Greece|region]] of [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and the counties of [[Gjirokastër County|Gjirokastër]], [[Vlorë County|Vlorë]], and [[Berat County|Berat]] in southern Albania. The largest city in Epirus is [[Ioannina]], seat of the region of Epirus, with [[Gjirokastër]] the largest city in the Albanian part of Epirus.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

A rugged and mountainous region, Epirus was the north-west area of [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name="OCD527"/&gt; It was inhabited by the Greek tribes of the [[Chaonians]], [[Molossians]], and [[Thesprotians]], and home to the sanctuary of [[Dodona]], the oldest ancient Greek [[oracle]], and the most prestigious one after [[Delphi]]. Unified into a [[Epirus (ancient state)|single state]] in 370 BC by the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty, Epirus achieved fame during the reign of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]], whose [[Pyrrhic War|campaigns]] against [[Roman Republic|Rome]] are the origin of the term "[[Pyrrhic victory]]". Epirus subsequently became part of the [[Roman Empire]] along with the rest of Greece in 146 BC, which was followed by the [[Byzantine Empire]].

Following [[Fall of Constantinople|the fall]] of [[Constantinople]] to the [[Fourth Crusade]], Epirus became the center of the [[Despotate of Epirus]], one of the successor states to the Byzantine Empire. Conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century, Epirus became semi-independent during the rule of [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena|Ali Pasha]] in the early 19th century, but the Ottomans re-asserted their control in 1821. Following the [[Balkan Wars]] and [[World War I]], southern Epirus became part of [[Greece]], while [[northern Epirus]] became part of [[Albania]].

==Name and etymology==
[[File:Epirus234bc.jpg|thumb|right|Coin of the Epirote League, depicting Zeus (left) and a lightning bolt with the word "ΑΠΕΙΡΩΤΑΝ" – Epirotes (right).]]
The name ''Epirus'' is derived from the {{lang-el|Ἤπειρος}}, ''Ḗpeiros'' ([[Doric Greek|Doric]]: {{lang|grc|Ἄπειρος}}, ''Ápeiros''), meaning "mainland" or ''[[wikt:terra firma|terra firma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2347463 ἤπειρ-ος]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought to come from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;apero-'' 'coast',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiniotis|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and was originally applied to the mainland opposite [[Corfu]] and the [[Ionian islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnifrith|2002|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The local name was stamped on the coinage of the [[Epirote League|unified Epirote commonwealth]]: ΑΠΕΙΡΩΤΑΝ ({{lang|grc|Ἀπειρωτᾶν}}, ''Āpeirōtân'', [[Attic Greek|Attic]]: {{lang|grc|Ἠπειρωτῶν}}, ''Ēpeirōtôn'', i.e. "of the Epirotes", see image right). The [[Albanian language|Albanian]] name for the region, which derives from the Greek, is ''Epiri''.

==Boundaries and definitions==
[[File:Epirus landsat.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[NASA]] satellite image of Epirus.]]

The historical region of Epirus is generally regarded as extending from the northern end of the [[Ceraunian mountains]] (modern Llogara in Albania), located just south of the Bay of Aulon (modern [[Vlorë]]), to the [[Ambracian Gulf]] (or Gulf of [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]) in Greece.&lt;ref name="Book VII, Chapter 7.5"&gt;Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7G*.html 7.7.5].&lt;/ref&gt; The northern boundary of ancient Epirus is alternatively given as the mouth of the [[Aoös]] (or [[Vjosë]]) river, immediately to the north of the Bay of Vlorë.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=92}}: "Appian's description of the Illyrian territories records a southern boundary with Chaonia and Thesprotia, where ancient Epirus began south of the river Aous (Vijosë)." ([https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=illyrians%20wilkes&amp;pg=PR20 Map])&lt;/ref&gt; Epirus's eastern boundary is defined by the [[Pindus Mountains]], that form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] and [[Thessaly]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; To the west, Epirus faces the [[Ionian Sea]]. The island of [[Corfu]] is situated off the Epirote coast but is not regarded as part of Epirus.

The definition of Epirus has changed over time, such that modern administrative boundaries do not correspond to the boundaries of ancient Epirus. The [[Epirus (region)|region of Epirus]] in Greece only comprises a fraction of classical Epirus and does not include its easternmost portions, which lie in Thessaly. In Albania, where the concept of Epirus is never used in an official context, the counties of Gjirokastër, [[Vlorë County|Vlorë]], and [[Berat County|Berat]] extend well beyond the northern and northeastern boundaries of classical Epirus.

==Geography and ecology==
[[File:Smolikas IMG 0118.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Smolikas|Mount Smolikas]] (2637m/8652f), the highest point in Epirus.]]
[[File:Zagori Vikos gorge Oxia towards Vikos.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Vikos Gorge]] in [[Vikos–Aoös National Park]].]]

Epirus is a predominantly rugged and mountainous region. It is largely made up of the [[Pindus Mountains]], a series of parallel [[limestone]] ridges that are a continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/190156/Epirus|title=Epirus|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=16 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bahr|Johnston|Bloomfield|1997|p=389}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pindus mountains form the spine of mainland Greece and separate Epirus from Macedonia and Thessaly to the east. The ridges of the Pindus are parallel to the sea and generally so steep that the valleys between them are mostly suitable for pasture rather than large-scale agriculture.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Altitude increases as one moves east, away from the coast, reaching a maximum of 2,637&amp;nbsp;m at [[Smolikas|Mount Smolikas]], the highest point in Epirus. Other important ranges include [[Tymfi]] (2,496&amp;nbsp;m at Mount Gamila), [[Lygkos]] (2,249&amp;nbsp;m), to the west and east of Smolikas respectively, [[Gramos]] (2,523&amp;nbsp;m) in the northeast, Tzoumerka (2,356&amp;nbsp;m) in the southeast, Tomaros (1,976&amp;nbsp;m) in the southwest, [[Mitsikeli]] near [[Ioannina]] (1,810&amp;nbsp;m), [[Mourgana]] (1,806&amp;nbsp;m) and [[Nemercke|Nemercke/Aeoropos]] (2,485&amp;nbsp;m) on the border between Greece and Albania, and the [[Ceraunian Mountains]] (2,000&amp;nbsp;m) near [[Himara]] in Albania. Most of Epirus lies on the windward side of the Pindus, and the prevailing winds from the Ionian Sea make the region the rainiest in mainland Greece.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

Significant lowlands are to be found only near the coast, in the southwest near [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and [[Preveza]], in the Acheron plain between [[Paramythia]] and [[Fanari, Preveza|Fanari]], between [[Igoumenitsa]] and [[Sagiada]], and also near [[Saranda]]. The [[Zagori]] area is a scenic upland plateau surrounded by mountain on all sides.

The main river flowing through Epirus is the [[Vjosë]] (''Aoös'' in Greek), which flows in a northwesterly direction from the Pindus mountains in Greece to its mouth north of the [[Bay of Vlorë]] in Albania. Other important rivers include the [[Acheron|Acheron river]], famous for its religious significance in ancient Greece and site of the [[Necromanteion]], the [[Arachthos river]], crossed by the historic [[Bridge of Arta]], the [[Louros (river)|Louros]], the [[Thyamis]] or Kalamas, and the Voidomatis, a tributary of the Vjosë flowing through the [[Vikos Gorge]]. The Vikos Gorge, one of the deepest in the world, forms the centerpiece of the [[Vikos–Aoös National Park]], known for its scenic beauty. The only significant lake in Epirus is [[Lake Pamvotis]], on whose shores lies the city of [[Ioannina]], the region's largest and traditionally most important city.

The climate of Epirus is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] along the coast and [[Alpine climate|Alpine]] in the interior. Epirus is heavily forested, mainly by coniferous species. The fauna in Epirus is especially rich and features species such as [[bear]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], [[fox]]es, [[deer]] and [[lynx]]es.

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Proto Greek Area reconstruction.png|thumb|left|200px|Epirus was part of the [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]] area according to linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev|V. I. Georgiev]].]]
[[File:EpirusMycynaen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Helladic period|Mycenaean]] sites in the [[Epirus (region)|region of Epirus]].]]
Epirus has been occupied since at least [[Neolithic]] times by seafarers along the coast and by hunters and shepherds in the interior who brought with them the [[Greek language]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; These people buried their leaders in large [[tumuli]] containing [[shaft grave]]s, similar to the [[Mycenaean period|Mycenaean]] tombs, indicating an ancestral link between Epirus and the Mycenaean civilization.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; A number of Mycenaean remains have been found in Epirus,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tandy|2001|p=4}}; {{harvnb|McHenry|2003|loc=p. 527: "Epirus itself remained culturally backward during this time, but Mycenean remains have been found at two religious shrines of great antiquity in the region: the Oracle of the Dead on the Acheron River, familiar to the heroes of Homer's Odyssey."}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially at the most important ancient religious sites in the region, the [[Necromanteion]] (Oracle of the Dead) on the [[Acheron]] river, and the Oracle of [[Zeus]] at [[Dodona]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

In the Middle Bronze Age, Epirus was inhabited by the same nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle in the rest of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borza|1992|pp=62, 78, 98}}; {{harvnb|Minahan|2002|p=578}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle considered the region around Dodona to have been part of [[Ancient Greece|Hellas]] and the region where the [[Hellenes]] originated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1986|p=77}}: "The original home of the Hellenes was 'Hellas', the area round Dodona in Epirus, according to Aristotle. In the Iliad it was the home of Achilles' Hellenes."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Meteorologica'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.1.i.html 1.14]: "Rather we must take the cause of all these changes to be that, just as winter occurs in the seasons of the year, so in determined periods there comes a great winter of a great year and with it excess of rain. But this excess does not always occur in the same place. The deluge in the time of Deucalion, for instance, took place chiefly in the Greek world and in it especially about ancient Hellas, the country about Dodona and the Achelous, a river which has often changed its course. Here the Selli dwelt and those who were formerly called Graeci and now Hellenes."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bulgarian linguist [[Vladimir I. Georgiev]], Epirus was part of the [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek linguistic area]] during the Late Neolithic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Georgiev|1981|loc=p. 192: "''Late Neolithic Period'': in northwestern Greece the Proto-Greek language had already been formed: this is the original home of the Greeks."}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1st millennium BC, all fourteen Epirote tribes including the [[Chaonians]] in northwestern Epirus, the [[Molossians]] in the centre and the [[Thesprotians]] in the south, were speakers of a strong west Greek dialect.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref name="OCD527"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1998}}; {{harvnb|Wilkes|1995|p=104}}; {{harvnb|Lewis|Boardman|1994|pp=430, 434}}; {{harvnb|Boardman|Hammond|1982|p=284}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epirus in the Classical and Hellenistic periods===

[[File:Map of ancient Epirus and environs (English).svg|right|thumb|200px|Tribes of Epirus in antiquity.]]
{{Main|Epirus (ancient state)}}

Unlike most other Greeks of this time, who lived in or around [[city-state]]s, the inhabitants of Epirus lived in small villages and their way of life was foreign to that of the [[polis|poleis]] of southern Greece.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1967}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their region lay on the periphery of the Greek world&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a [[frontier]] area contested with the [[Illyrian peoples]] to the north. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than might have been expected given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at [[Dodona]] – regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at [[Delphi]].

The Epirotes, speakers of a [[Northwest Greek]] dialect, different from the [[Dorians|Dorian]] of the Greek colonies on the Ionian islands, and bearers of mostly Greek names, as evidenced by epigraphy, seem to have been regarded with some disdain by some classical writers. The 5th-century BC Athenian historian [[Thucydides]] describes them as "[[Barbarian#Origin of the term|barbarians]]" in his ''History of the Peloponnesian War'',&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Thucydides/pelopwar.mb.txt 1.8].&lt;/ref&gt; as does [[Strabo]] in his ''Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;Strabo. ''Geography'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/7G*.html 7.7.1].&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers, such as [[Herodotus]],&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus. ''Histories'', 6.127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]],&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius of Halicarnassus. ''Roman Antiquities'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Dionysius_of_Halicarnassus/20*.html 20.10 (19.11)].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]],&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias. ''Description of Greece'', [http://www.theoi.com/Text/Pausanias1A.html 1.11.7–1.12.2].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eutropius (historian)|Eutropius]],&lt;ref&gt;Eutropius. ''Abridgment of Roman History'' (Historiae Romanae Breviarium), [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eutropius_breviarium_2_text.htm 2.11.13].&lt;/ref&gt; describe them as Greeks. Similarly, Epirote tribes/states are included in the [[Argos|Argive]] and [[Epidaurus|Epidaurian]] lists of the Greek Thearodokoi (hosts of sacred envoys).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brock|Hodkinson|2002|loc=J. K. Davies, "A Wholly Non-Aristotelian Universe: The Molossians as Ethnos, State and Monarchy", pp. 234–258}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plutarch]] mentions an interesting element of Epirote folklore regarding Achilles: In his biography of King [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], he claims that Achilles "had a divine status in Epirus and in the local dialect he was called Aspetos" (meaning ''unspeakable'', ''unspeakably great'', in [[Homeric Greek]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cameron|2004|p=141}}: "As for Aspestos, Achilles was honored in Epirus under that name, and the patronymic [Ἀ]σπετίδης is found in a fragmentary poem found on papyrus."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;cf. Athenian secretary: Aspetos, son of Demostratos from [[Kytheros (deme)|Kytheros]] c. 340 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 370 BC, the [[Molossian]] [[Aeacidae]] dynasty built a [[Epirus (ancient state)|centralized state in Epirus]] and began expanding their power at the expense of rival tribes.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The Aeacids allied themselves with the increasingly powerful kingdom of [[Macedon]], in part against the common threat of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] raids,&lt;ref name="Companion"&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Edward M. Anson, "Why Study Ancient Macedonia and What this ''Companion'' is About", p. 5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 359 BC the Molossian princess [[Olympias]], niece of [[Arybbas of Epirus]], married King [[Philip II of Macedon]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; She was to become the mother of [[Alexander the Great]].

On the death of Arybbas, [[Alexander of Epirus]] succeeded to the throne and the title [[Epirus (ancient state)|King of Epirus]] in 334 BC. He invaded Italy, but was killed in battle by a [[Lucania]]n in the [[Battle of Pandosia]] against several [[Italic tribes]] 331 BC.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Livy 1926, 8.24.8–14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aeacides of Epirus]], who succeeded Alexander, espoused the cause of Olympias against [[Cassander]], but was dethroned in 313 BC. His son [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] came to throne in 295 BC, and for six years fought against the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] and [[Carthage (state)|Carthaginians]] in southern [[Italy]] and [[Sicily]]. The high cost of his victories against the Romans gave Epirus a new, but brief, importance, as well as a lasting contribution to the Greek language with the concept of a "[[Pyrrhic victory]]". Pyrrhus nonetheless brought great prosperity to Epirus, building the great theater of [[Dodona]] and a new suburb at [[Ambracia]] (now modern [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]), which he made his capital.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

The Aeacid dynasty ended in 232 BC, but Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament, or ''synedrion''.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; However, it was faced with the growing threat of the expansionist [[Roman Republic]], which fought a series of wars against [[Macedon]]. The League steered an uneasy neutral course in the first two Macedonian Wars but split in the [[Third Macedonian War]] (171–168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians siding with Rome.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The outcome was disastrous for Epirus; Molossia fell to Rome in 167 BC and 150,000 of its inhabitants were enslaved.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

===Roman and Byzantine rule===
===={{anchor|Epirus Vetus}}Epirus as a Roman province====
The region of Epirus was placed under the [[senatorial province]] of [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] in 27 BC, with the exception of its northernmost part, which remained part of the province of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=47}} Under Emperor [[Trajan]], sometime between 103 and 114 AD, Epirus became a separate province, under a ''[[procurator (Roman)|procurator]] [[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]''. The new province extended from the Gulf of Aulon ([[Vlorë]]) and the [[Acroceraunian Mountains]] in the north to the lower course of the [[Acheloos River]] in the south, and included the northern Ionian Islands of [[Corfu]], [[Lefkada]], [[Ithaca]], [[Cephallonia]], and [[Zakynthos]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=47}}

[[File:Ancient Epirus &amp; Modern Borders (Colored).svg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Roman province|Roman provinces]] of [[Epirus Vetus]] and [[Epirus Nova]] in relation to modern borders.]]
Probably during the provincial reorganization by [[Diocletian]] (r. 284–305), the western portion of the province of Macedonia along the Adriatic coast was split off into the province of New Epirus ({{lang-la|[[Epirus Nova]]}}). Although this territory was not traditionally part of Epirus proper as defined by the ancient geographers, and was historically inhabited predominantly by Illyrian tribes, the name reflects the fact that under Roman rule, the area had been subject to increasing Hellenization and settlement by Epirote tribes from the south.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=47}}

The two Epirote provinces became part of the [[Diocese of Moesia]], until it was divided in ca. 369 into the dioceses of [[Diocese of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Diocese of Dacia|Dacia]], when they became part of the former.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=47–48}} In the 4th century, Epirus was still a stronghold of [[paganism]], and was aided by Emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] (r. 361–363) and his [[praetorian prefect]] [[Claudius Mamertinus]] through reduction in taxes and the rebuilding of the provincial capital, [[Nicopolis]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} According to [[Jordanes]], in 380 the [[Visigoths]] raided the area.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} With the division of the Empire on the death of [[Theodosius I]] in 395, Epirus became part of the Eastern Roman or [[Byzantine Empire]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} In 395–397, the Visigoths under [[Alaric I|Alaric]] plundered Greece. They remained in Epirus for a few years, until 401, and again in 406–407, during Alaric's alliance with the [[Western Roman]] generalissimo [[Stilicho]] in order to wrest the [[Eastern Illyricum]] from the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}}

[[File:Butrint-111198.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Buthrotum]]]]
The ''[[Synecdemus]]'' of [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]], composed in ca. 527/8 AD but probably reflecting the situation in the first half of the 5th century, reports 11 cities for Old Epirus ({{lang-grc|Παλαιᾶ Ἤπειρος}}, {{lang-la|[[Epirus Vetus]]}}): the capital Nicopolis, [[Dodona]], [[Euroea in Epiro|Euroea]], [[Dropull|Hadrianopolis]], [[Appon]], [[Phoenice]], [[Anchiasmos]], [[Buthrotum]], [[Photike]], Corfu Island, and Ithaca Island.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=48–49}} New Epirus, with capital at [[Dyrrhachium]], comprised 9 cities.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=48}} From 467 on, the Ionian Islands and the coasts of Epirus became subject to raids by the [[Vandals]], who had taken over the [[North Africa]]n provinces and established their [[Kingdom of the Vandals|own kingdom]] centred on [[Carthage]]. The Vandals notably seized Nicopolis in 474 as a bargaining chip in their negotiations with Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]], and plundered Zakynthos, killing many of its inhabitants and ferrying off others into slavery.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=49}} [[Epirus Nova]] became a battleground in the rebellions of the [[Ostrogoths]] after 479.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=49}} In 517, a raid of the [[Getae]] or [[Antae]] reached Greece, including [[Epirus Vetus]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=49}} The claim of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] in his ''Secret History'', that under [[Justinian I]] (r. 527–565) the entirety of the Balkan provinces was raided by barbarians every year, is considered rhetorical hyperbole by modern scholars; only a single Slavic raid to the environs of Dyrrhachium, in 548/9, has been documented.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=49}} Procopius further reports that in 551, in an attempt to interdict the Byzantines' lines of communication with Italy during the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]], the Ostrogoth king [[Totila]] sent his fleet to raid the shores of Epirus.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=50}} In response to these raids, and to repair the damage done by two destructive earthquakes in 522, Justinian initiated a wide-ranging programme of reconstruction and re-fortification: Hadrianopolis was rebuilt, albeit in reduced extent, and renamed Justinianopolis, while [[Euroea in Epiro|Euroea]] was moved further inland (traditionally identified with the founding of [[Ioannina]]), while Procopius claims that no less than 36 smaller fortresses in Epirus Vetus—most of them not identifiable today—were either rebuilt or built anew.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=50}}

====Epirus from the Slavic invasions until 1204====
In the late 6th century, much of Greece, including Epirus, fell under the control of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and their Slavic allies. This is placed by the ''[[Chronicle of Monemvasia]]'' in the year 587, and is further corroborated by evidence that several sees were abandoned by their bishops by 591. Thus in ca. 590 the bishop, clergy and people of Euroea fled their city, carrying with them the relics of their patron saint, [[Donatus of Evorea|St. Donatus]], to Cassiope in Corfu.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=51}}

Of the various Slavic tribes, only the [[Baiounitai]], first attested ca. 615, are known by name, giving their name to their region of settlement: "[[Vagenetia]]".{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=51}} Based on the density of the Slavic toponyms in Epirus, the Slavs must have settled in the region, although the extent of this settlement is unclear.&lt;ref name="EllisKlusakova2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Steven G. Ellis|editor2=Luda Klusakova|author=Brendan Osswald|title=Imagining Frontiers, Contesting Identities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zXFCs9EfEYC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-466-7|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slavic toponyms occur mainly in the mountainous areas of the interior and the coasts of the [[Gulf of Corinth]], indicative of the fact that this was the avenue used by most of the Slavs who crossed the Gulf into the [[Peloponnese]]. With the exception of some few toponyms on Corfu, the Ionian Islands seem to not have been affected. The linguistic analysis of the toponyms reveals that they date mostly to the early wave of Slavic settlement at the turn of the 6th/7th centuries. Due to scarcity of textual evidence, it is unclear how much the area was affected by the second wave of Slavic migration, which began in the middle of the 8th century due to [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgar]] pressure in the northern Balkans.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=51–52}}

As in eastern Greece, the restoration of Byzantine rule seems to have proceeded from the islands, chiefly Cephallonia, which was certainly under firm control in ca. 702, when [[Philippicus Bardanes]] was banished there. The gradual restoration of imperial rule is evidenced further from the participation of local bishops in councils in [[Constantinople]]: whereas only the bishop of Dyrrhachium participated in the Ecumenical Councils of [[Third Council of Constantinople|680/1]] and [[Quinisext Council|692]], a century later the bishops of Dyrrhachium, Nicopolis, Corfu, Cephallonia, and Zakynthos are attested in the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] in 787.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=52}} In about the middle of the 8th century, the [[Theme of Cephallenia]] was established, but at least initially it was more oriented towards restoring Byzantine control over the Ionian and Adriatic seas, combating Saracen piracy, and securing communications with the remaining Byzantine possessions in Italy, rather than any systematic effort at subduing the Epirote mainland.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=52}} Nevertheless, following the onset of the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily]] in 827, the Ionian became particularly exposed to Arab raids.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=53}}

[[File:Byzantine Greece ca 900 AD.svg|thumb|right|200 px|Map of [[Byzantine Greece]] ca. 900 AD, with the themes and major settlements]]
The 9th century however saw great progress in the restoration of imperial control in the mainland, as evidenced by the participation of the bishops of Ioannina, [[Naupaktos]], Hadrianopolis, and Vagenetia (evidently by now organized as a ''[[Sklavinia]]'' under imperial rule) in the Ecumenical Councils of [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Roman Catholic)|869/70]] and [[Fourth Council of Constantinople (Eastern Orthodox)|879/80]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=53}} The Byzantine recovery resulted in an influx of Greeks from southern Italy and [[Asia Minor]] into the Greek interior, while remaining Slavs were Christianized and [[Hellenization|Hellenized]].&lt;ref name="Fine1991"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John V. A. Fine|author2=John Van Antwerp Fine|title=The Early Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Sixth to the Late Twelfth Century|page=64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0NBxG9Id58C|year=1991|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-08149-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The success of the Hellenization campaign also suggests continuity of the original Greek population and that the Slavs had settled among many Greeks, in contrast to areas further north in what is now Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia, as those areas could not be Hellenized when they were recovered by the Byzantines in the early 11th century.&lt;ref name="Fine1991"/&gt;  Following the [[Battle of Cephalonia|great naval victory]] of admiral [[Nasar]] in 880, and the beginning of the Byzantine offensive against the Arabs in southern Italy in the 880s, the situation improved and the [[Theme of Nicopolis]] was established, most likely after 886.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=53}}{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=1485}} As the ancient capital of Epirus had been laid waste by the Slavs, the capital of the new theme became Naupaktos further south. The extent of the new province is unclear, but probably matched the extent of the [[Metropolis of Naupaktos]], established at about the same time: Vonditsa, Aetos, Acheloos, [[Rogoi]], Ioannina, Hadrianopolis, Photike, Buthrotum. Vagenetia notably no longer appears as a bishopric. As the authors of the ''Tabula Imperii Byzantini'' comment, it appears that "the Byzantine administration had brought the strongly Slavic-settled areas in the mainland somewhat under its control, and a certain Re-Hellenization had set in".{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=53–54}} Further north, the region around [[Dyrrhachium]] existed as the [[Dyrrhachium (theme)|homonymous theme]] possibly as early as the 9th century.{{sfn|Kazhdan|1991|p=668}}

During the early 10th century, both themes of Cephallenia and Nicopolis appear mostly as bases for expeditions against southern Italy and Sicily, while [[Mardaites]] from both themes are listed in the large but unsuccessful expedition of 949 against the [[Emirate of Crete]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=54}} In ca. 930, the Theme of Nicopolis was raided by the Bulgarians, who even occupied some parts until driven out or subjugated by the Byzantines years later.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=54}} Only the extreme north of Epirus seems to have remained consistently under Bulgarian rule in the period, but under Tsar [[Samuel of Bulgaria|Samuel]], who moved the centre of Bulgarian power south and west to [[Ohrid]], probably all of Epirus down to the [[Ambracian Gulf]] came under Bulgarian rule.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=55}} This is evidenced from the fact that the territories that were under Bulgarian rule formed part of the [[autocephalous]] [[Archbishopric of Ohrid]] after the [[Byzantine conquest of Bulgaria]] by Emperor [[Basil II]] in 1018: thus in Epirus the sees of [[Chimara]], Hadrianopolis, Bela, Buthrotum, Ioannina, Kozyle, and Rogoi passed under the jurisdiction of Ohrid, while the Metropolitan of Naupaktos retained only the sees of Bonditza, Aetos, and Acheloos.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=55}} Basil II also established new, smaller themes in the region: [[Kolonje|Koloneia]], and Dryinoupolis (Hadrianopolis).{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|p=55}}

The region joined the [[uprising of Petar Delyan]] in 1040, and suffered in the [[Byzantine–Norman Wars]] of the late 11th century: Dyrrhachium was [[Battle of Dyrrhachium (1081)|occupied]] by the [[Normans]] in 1081–1084, [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] was unsuccessfully besieged, and Ioannina was captured by [[Robert Guiscard]].{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=55–56}} An [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] presence in Epirus is first mentioned in the late 11th century, while Jewish communities are attested throughout the medieval period in [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] and Ioannina.{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=129}}

====Epirus between 1204 and the Ottoman conquest====
[[File:Epirus 1205-1230-en.svg|thumb|200px|alt=Map of the Balkans, with the original core of Epirus and its conquered territories shown in various shades of green|Expansion of the [[Despotate of Epirus]] in the early 13th century.]]
When [[Constantinople]] fell to the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, the ''[[partitio Romaniae]]'' assigned Epirus to [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], but the Venetians were largely unable to effectively establish their authority except over [[Dyrrhachium]]. The Greek noble [[Michael I Komnenos Doukas|Michael Komnenos Doukas]], who had married the daughter of a local magnate, took advantage of this, and within a few years consolidated his control, first as a Venetian [[vassal]] and eventually as an independent ruler. By the time of his death in 1214/5, Michael had established a strong state, the [[Despotate of Epirus]], with the former theme of Nicopolis at its core and Arta as its capital.{{sfn|Soustal|Koder|1981|pp=59–61}}{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=132}} Epirus, and the city of Ioannina in particular, became a haven for Greek refugees from Constantinople for most of the century.{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=132}} The Despotate of Epirus ruled over Epirus and western Greece as far south as [[Nafpaktos]] and the [[Gulf of Corinth]], much of Albania (including Dyrrhachium), Thessaly, and the western portion of Greek Macedonia, extending its rule briefly over central [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and most of [[Thrace]] following the aggressive expansionism of [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas]] who established the [[Empire of Thessalonica]] in 1224.{{sfn|Nicol|1984|loc="Introduction", pp. 4–5}}{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=133}} During this time, the definition of Epirus came to encompass the entire coastal region from the Ambracian Gulf to Dyrrhachium and the hinterland to the west up to the highest peaks of the [[Pindus]] mountain range. Some of the most important cities in Epirus, such as Gjirokastër (Argyrokastron), were founded during this period. The oldest reference to Albanians in Epirus is from a Venetian document dating to 1210, which states that "the continent facing the island of Corfu is inhabited by Albanians" though a pre-14th century Albanian migration can't be confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kosta_Giakoumis/publication/233673710_Fourteenth-century_Albanian_migration_and_the_%27relative_autochthony%27_of_the_Albanians_in_Epeiros_The_case_of_Gjirokaster/links/0deec52ab0987b856e000000/Fourteenth-century-Albanian-migration-and-the-relative-autochthony-of-the-Albanians-in-Epeiros-The-case-of-Gjirokaster.pdf (p.176)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1337, Epirus was once again brought under Byzantine imperial rule.{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=133}}

In 1348, taking advantage of the [[Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347|civil war]] between [[John V Palaiologos]] and [[John VI Kantakouzenos]], the Serbian King [[Stefan Uroš IV Dušan]] conquered Epirus, with a number of [[Albanians|Albanian]] mercenaries assisting him.{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=135}}  The Byzantine authorities in Constantinople soon re-established a measure of control by making the Despotate of Epirus a [[vassal state]], but meanwhile Albanian clans invaded, seized most of the region, and founded two local, short-lived entities, centered in [[Despotate of Arta|Arta]] (1358–1416) and [[Principality of Gjirokastër|Gjirokastër]] (1386–1411) by the Losha and Zenebishi clans, respectively. Only the city of Ioannina remained under Greek control during this time.{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=134}} Although Albanian clans gained control of most of the region of Epirus by 1366–7, they did not succeed any Greek or Serbian central authority in the region but remained divided in clans.&lt;ref name="mb"&gt;{{harvnb|Fine|1994|pp=348–351}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ioannina became a center of Greek resistance, and the Greeks of Ioannina offered power to three foreign rulers during this time, beginning with [[Thomas II Preljubović]] (1367–1384), followed by [[Esau de' Buondelmonti]] (1385–1411), and finally [[Carlo I Tocco]] (1411–1429). The latter finally succeeded in ending the rule of the Albanian clans and unifying Epirus.{{sfn|Osswald|2007|p=136}} But internal dissension eased the Ottoman conquest, which proceeded with the capture of Ioannina in 1430, Arta in 1449, [[Angelokastro, Aetolia-Acarnania|Angelokastro]] in 1460, and finally [[Vonitsa]] in 1479. With the exception of several coastal Venetian possessions, this was the end of Frankish rule in mainland Greece.

Epirus was ruled by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] for almost 500 years. Ottoman rule in Epirus proved particularly damaging; the region was subjected to deforestation and excessive cultivation, which damaged the soil and drove many [[Epirotes]] to emigrate so as to escape the region's pervasive poverty.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Nonetheless, the Ottomans did not enjoy total control of Epirus. The [[Himara]] and [[Zagori]] regions managed to successfully resist Ottoman rule and maintained a degree of independence throughout this period. From 1443 onwards, [[Skenderbeg|George Kastrioti Skenderbeg]] led a 25-year revolt in [[Epirus Nova]] against the Ottoman Empire and was in 1444 elected "general of the Turkish war" in what is referred to as the [[League of Lezhë]], but died a fugitive in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="Gibbon1788p143"&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbon|1788|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans expelled the Venetians from almost the whole area in the late 15th century.

Between the 16th and 19th centuries, the city of Ioannina attained great prosperity and became a major center of the [[modern Greek Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sakellariou|1997|p=268}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fleming&gt;{{harvnb|Fleming|1999|pp=63–66}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.greece2001.gr/docs/67-132.pdf The Era of Enlightenment (Late 7th century-1821)]''.

Φορέας του πνεύματος στα Ιωάννινα είναι ο Αθανάσιος Ψαλίδας."&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous schools were founded, such as the Balaneios, [[Maroutsaia School|Maroutsaia]], [[Kaplaneios School|Kaplaneios]], and [[Zosimaia School|Zosimaia]], teaching subjects such as literature, philosophy, mathematics and physical sciences. In the 18th century, as the power of the Ottoman Empire declined, Epirus became a ''de facto'' independent region under the despotic rule of [[Ali Pasha of Tepelena]], a Muslim [[Albanians|Albanian]] brigand who rose to become the provincial governor of Ioannina in 1788.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; At the height of his power, he controlled all of Epirus, and much of the [[Peloponnese]], central Greece, and parts of western [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Ali Pasha's campaign to subjugate the confederation of the settlements of [[Souli]] met with fierce resistance by the [[Souliotes|Souliot]] warriors of the mountainous area. After numerous failed attempts to defeat the Souliotes, his troops succeeded in conquering the area in 1803. On the other hand, Ali, who used Greek as official language, witnessed an increase of Greek cultural activity with the establishment of several educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleming|1999|p=64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Greek War of Independence]] broke out, the inhabitants of Epirus contributed greatly. Two of the founding members of the [[Filiki Eteria]] (the secret society of the Greek revolutionaries), [[Nikolaos Skoufas]] and Athanasios Tsakalov, came from the [[Arta (regional unit)|Arta]] area and the city of [[Ioannina]], respectively. Greece's first constitutional prime minister (1844–1847), [[Ioannis Kolettis]], was a native of the village of Syrrako in Epirus and was a former personal physician to Ali Pasha. Ali Pasha tried to use the war as an opportunity to make himself a fully independent ruler, but was assassinated by Ottoman agents in 1822. When Greece became independent in 1830, however, Epirus remained under Ottoman rule. In 1854, during the [[Crimean War]], a major local [[Epirus Revolt of 1854|rebellion broke out]]. Although the newly found Greek state tried tacitly to support it, the rebellion was suppressed by Ottoman forces after a few months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reid|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another failed rebellion by local Greeks [[Epirus revolt of 1878|broke out in 1878]]. During this period, the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]]
managed to shut down the few Albanian schools, considering teaching in Albanian a factor that would diminish its influence and lead to the creation of separate Albanian church, while publications in Albanian were banned by the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jelavich|Jelavich|1977|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ramet1998"&gt;{{harvnb|Ramet|1998|p=205}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century, the Kingdom of Italy opened various schools in the regions of [[Ioannina]] and [[Preveza]] in order to influence the local population. These schools began to attract students from the Greek language schools, but were ultimately closed after intervention and harassment by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople.&lt;ref name="schwanders"&gt;{{harvnb|Schwandner-Sievers|Fischer|2002|loc=Isa Blumi, "The Role of Education in the Albanian Identity and its Myths", p. 57}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout, the late period of Ottoman rule (from the 18th century) Greek and Aromanian population of the region suffered from Albanians raiders, that sporadically continued after Ali Pasha's death, until 1912–1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hammond|1976|p=41}}: "Throughout this period bands of Albanians raiders pillaged and destroyed the villages of the Vlachs and the Greeks in Epirus, northern Pindus, the lakeland of Prespa and Ochrid, and parts of western Macedonia. One Albanian leader, 'Ali the Lion', emulated the achievements of 'John the Sword' and 'Peter the Pockmark' when he established himself as Ali Pasha, independent ruler of Ioannina. He and his Albanian soldiers, recruited mainly from his homeland in the Kurvelesh and the Drin valley of North Epirus, controlled the whole of Epirus and carried their raids far into western Macedonia and Thessaly. As we have seen, they destroyed the Vlach settlements in the lakeland and weakened those farther south. After the assassination of Ali Pasha in 1822 sporadic raids by bands of Albanians were a feature of life in northern Greece until the liberation of 1912–13."&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century Epirus===
[[File:Epirote women Aug1914.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Detachment of armed Epirote women in the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]].]]

While the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)]] awarded large parts of Epirus to Greece, opposition by the Ottomans and the [[League of Prizren]] resulted in only the region of [[Arta (regional unit)|Arta]] being ceded to Greece in 1881.&lt;ref name="Gawrych2006"&gt;{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=68–69}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only following the [[First Balkan War]] of 1912–1913 and the [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] that the rest of southern Epirus, including [[Ioannina]], was incorporated into Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2002|p=105}}: "In February 1913 the Greek Army seized Ioannina, the capital of Epirus. The Turks recognized the gains of the Balkan allies by the Treaty of London, in May 1913."&lt;/ref&gt; Greece had also seized northern Epirus during the [[Balkan Wars]], but the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]], which concluded the [[Second Balkan War]], assigned [[Northern Epirus]] to Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clogg|2002|p=105}}: "The Second Balkan War had short duration and the Bulgarians were soon dragged to the table of negotiations. By the Treaty of Bucharest (August 1913) Bulgaria was forced to accept a little favourable regulation of the borders, even if she kept a way to the Aegean, in Degeagatch (modern Alexandroupolis). The sovereignty of Greece over Crete was now recognised, but her ambition to annex Northern Epirus with its large Greek population was stopped by the annexation of the area to an independent Albania."&lt;/ref&gt;

This outcome was unpopular among local Greeks, as a substantial Greek population existed on the Albanian side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pettifer|2001|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among Greeks, [[northern Epirus]] was henceforth regarded as ''[[irredentism|terra irredenta]]''.&lt;ref name="Konidaris"&gt;{{harvnb|King|Mai|Schwandner-Sievers|2005|loc=Gerasimos Konidaris, "Examining Policy Responses to Immigration in the Light of Interstate Relations and Foreign Policy Objectives: Greece and Albania", pp. 64–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Local Greeks in northern Epirus revolted, declared [[Northern Epirote Declaration of Independence|their independence]] and proclaimed the [[Autonomous Republic of Northern Epirus]] in February 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winnifrith|2002|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After fierce guerrilla fighting, they managed to gain full autonomy under the terms of the [[Protocol of Corfu]], signed by Albanian and Northern Epirote representatives and approved by the Great Powers. The signing of the Protocol ensured that the region would have its own administration, recognized the rights of the local Greeks and provided self-government under nominal Albanian sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Stickney"&gt;{{harvnb|Stickney|1926}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic, however, was short-lived, as when [[World War I]] broke out, Albania collapsed, and northern Epirus was alternately controlled by Greece, Italy and France at various intervals.&lt;ref name="Konidaris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TuckerRoberts2005"&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although short-lived, this state managed to leave behind a number of historical records of its existence, including its own postage stamps; see [[Postage stamps and postal history of Epirus]].&lt;ref name="Stickney"/&gt;

Although the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] of 1919 awarded Northern Epirus to Greece, developments such as the Greek defeat in the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] and, crucially, Italian lobbying in favor of Albania meant that Greece would not keep Northern Epirus. In 1924, the area was again ceded to Albania.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1966|pp=543–544}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|occupied Albania]], and in 1940 [[Greco-Italian War|invaded Greece]]. The Italians were driven back into Albania, however, and Greek forces again took control of northern Epirus. The conflict marked the first tactical victory of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in [[World War II]]. [[Benito Mussolini]] himself supervised the massive counter-attack of his divisions in spring 1941, only to be decisively defeated again by the poorly equipped, but determined, Greeks. [[Nazi Germany]] then [[Battle of Greece|intervened]] in April 1941 to avert an embarrassing, wholesale Italian defeat. The German military performed rapid military maneuvers through [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the encircled Greek forces of the Epirus front to surrender.

The whole of Epirus was then placed under Italian [[Axis Occupation of Greece|occupation]] until 1943, when the Germans took over following the [[Italian armistice|Italian surrender]] to the Allies. Due to the extensive activity of the anti-Nazi Greek resistance (mainly under [[EDES]]), the Germans carried out large scaled anti-partisan sweeps, making wide use of [[Axis-Cham Albanian collaboration|Nazi-collaborationist bands]] of [[Cham Albanians]], who committed numerous atrocities against the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruches|1965|pp=162–167}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To deal with the situation, the Allied Military Mission in the Axis-occupied Greece (under Colonel C. M. Woodhouse), gave EDES partisans direct orders to counter-attack and chase out of their villages those units that used them as bases and local strongholds. Helped by Allied war material transferred from the recently liberated southern Italy, EDES forces succeeded and as a result several thousands of Muslim [[Cham Albanians]] fled the area and took refuge in nearby Albania.

With the liberation of Greece and the start of the first round of the [[Greek Civil War]] at the end of 1944, the highlands of Epirus became a major theater of guerrilla warfare between the leftist [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) and the right-wing [[National Republican Greek League]] (EDES). In subsequent years (1945–1949), the mountains of Epirus also became the scene of some of the fiercest fighting of the second and bloodier round of the Greek Civil War. The final episode of the war took place on [[Gramos|Mount Grammos]] in 1949, ending with the defeat of the Communists. Peace returned to the region in 1949, although because of official Albanian active involvement in the civil war on the side of the communists, the formal state of war between Greece and Albania remained in effect until 1987. Another reason for the continuation of the state of war until 1987 was that during the entire period of Communist rule in Albania, the Greek population of [[Northern Epirus]] experienced forced [[Albanisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pettifer|2001|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a Greek minority was recognized by the Hoxha regime, this recognition only applied to an "official minority zone" consisting of 99 villages, leaving out important areas of Greek settlement, such as [[Himara]].&lt;ref name="Konidaris"/&gt; People outside the official minority zone received no education in the Greek language, which was prohibited in public.&lt;ref name="Konidaris"/&gt; The Hoxha regime also diluted the ethnic demographics of the region by relocating Greeks living there and settling in their stead Albanians from other parts of the country.&lt;ref name="Konidaris"/&gt; Relations began to improve in the 1980s with Greece's abandonment of any territorial claims over Northern Epirus and the lifting of the official state of war between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Konidaris"/&gt;

The collapse of the communist regime in Albania in 1990–1991 triggered a massive migration of Albanian citizens to Greece, which included many members of the Greek minority. Since the end of the [[Cold War]], many Greeks in Northern Epirus are re-discovering their Greek heritage thanks to the opening of Greek schools in the region, while Cham Albanians have called for compensation for their lost property. In the post-Cold War era, relations have continued to improve though tensions remain over the availability of education in the Greek language outside the official minority zone, the minority's property rights, and occasional violent incidents targeting members of the Greek minority.

==Economy==
[[File:New port of igoumenitsa.JPG|thumb|right|225px|[[Igoumenitsa]] is the main port in Epirus, and links the region to [[Italy]].]]
A rugged topography, poor soils, and fragmented landholdings have kept agricultural production low and have resulted in a low population density.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Animal husbandry is the main industry and corn the chief crop.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Oranges and olives are grown in the western lowlands, while tobacco is grown around Ioannina.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Epirus has few natural resources and industries, and the population has been depleted by migration.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The population is centered around Ioannina, which has the largest number of industrial establishments.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

==Transportation==
Epirus has historically been a remote and isolated region due to its location between the Pindus mountains and the sea. In antiquity, the Roman [[Via Egnatia]] passed through [[Epirus Nova]], which linked Byzantium and Thessalonica to [[Dyrrachium]] on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. The modern [[Egnatia Odos (modern road)|Egnatia highway]], which links [[Ioannina]] to the Greek province of Macedonia and terminating at [[Igoumenitsa]], is the only highway through the Pindus mountains and has served to greatly reduce the region's isolation from the east, while the [[Ionia Odos|Ionia highway]], connecting Epirus with [[Western Greece]], helped reducing the region's isolation from the south. Also, the [[Aktio-Preveza Undersea Tunnel]] connects the southernmost tip of Epirus, near [[Preveza]], with [[Aetolia-Acarnania]] in western Greece. Ferry services from [[Igoumenitsa]] to the [[Ionian islands]] and [[Italy]] exist. The only airport in Epirus is the [[Ioannina National Airport]], while the [[Aktion National Airport]] is located just south of Preveza in [[Aetolia-Acarnania]]. There are no railroads in Epirus.

'''Espalier''' ({{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|s|p|æ|l|ɪər}} or {{IPAc-en|ᵻ|ˈ|s|p|æ|l|i|.|eɪ}}) is the [[horticulture|horticultural]] and ancient [[Agriculture|agricultural]] practice of controlling woody plant growth for the production of fruit, by [[pruning]] and tying branches to a frame. Plants are frequently shaped  in formal patterns, flat against a structure such as a wall, fence, or trellis, and also plants which have been shaped in this way.&lt;ref name=NCSU&gt;{{Citation| last =Evans| first =Erv| title = Espalier|publisher=North Carolina State University Horticultural Science Department Cooperative Extension Service| url = http://www.ces.ncsu.edu/depts/hort/consumer/quickref/general/espalier.html| accessdate =2010-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Espaliers, trained into flat two-dimensional forms, are used not only for decorative purposes, but also for gardens in which space is limited. In a [[temperate climate]], espaliers may be trained next to a wall that can reflect more sunlight and retain heat overnight or orientated so that they absorb maximum sunlight by training them parallel to the equator.
These two strategies allow the [[Season extension|season to be extended]] so that fruit has more time to mature.

A restricted form of training consists of a central stem and a number of paired horizontal branches all trained in the same plane. 
The most important advantage is that of being able to increase the growth of a branch by training it vertically. Later, one can decrease growth while increasing fruit production by training it horizontally.

==History==
The word ''espalier'' is French, and it comes from the Italian ''spalliera'', meaning "something to rest the shoulder (''spalla'') against."&lt;ref name=IFAS&gt;{{Citation| first = Sydney Park | last = Brown | first2 = Thomas H.| last2 = Yeager| first3 = Robert J.| last3 = Black|title=Circular 627: Espaliers | date = September 2007|origyear=May 1985|page=1| place = Florida, USA| publisher = Department of Environmental Horticulture, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, University of Florida | url = http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/MG/MG27300.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 17th Century, the word initially referred only to the actual [[trellis (architecture)|trellis]] or frame on which such a plant was trained to grow, but over time it has come to be used to describe both the practice and the plants themselves.&lt;ref name="NCSU"/&gt;

Espalier as a technique seems to have started with the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}. In the [[Middle Ages]] the Europeans refined it into an art.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt; The practice was popularly used in [[Europe]] to produce fruit inside the walls of a typical castle courtyard without interfering with the open space and to decorate solid walls by planting flattened trees near them. [[Vineyard]]s have used the technique in the training of grapes for hundreds or perhaps even thousands of years.

==Belgian fence ==
[[File:American Embassy in Brussels.jpg|thumb|left|[[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|American Embassy]] [[Embassy of the United States, Brussels|in Brussels]] ]]
A Belgian fence is created by cutting back an unbranched, slender tree to between fifteen and eighteen inches above the ground. The topmost three buds are allowed to form; one in the middle is trained vertically while two others are trained into a V shape. Any other buds are rubbed away. Removing the vertical stem completes the individual V-shaped espalier. By placing many similarly trained trees in a line two feet apart with their branches trained to the same plane, a Belgian fence is created.

The Belgian fence is an intermediary form that can then be used to train onward to many other forms of espalier, including: Step-over, where the branches are lowered down to the horizontal in autumn while still flexible enough and tied to a trellis; Fan, where the branches are lowered and cut back then trained further; Horizontal T, where the branches are trained to horizontal as with step-over but the vertical stem is trained up to another level and cut usually in spring of the second year, where another V shape is created and the resulting branches finally being lowered to another wire in autumn of the second year. Multiple levels of horizontal branching can be trained in this way.

==Species choices==
[[File:DSCN3598 espalieredpeartree e.JPG|200px|left|thumb|A [[pear]] tree espaliered into a cordon. The picture was taken in the garden of [[the Cloisters]] in upper [[Manhattan]]]]
Certain types of trees adapt better to this practice than others, but almost any [[woody plant]] can be trained to grow along a flat plane by removing growth outside that plane.&lt;ref name=IFAS/&gt;
Horizontal T training of an apple or pear tree is a good example of the ideal species for espalier. In the spring, the tree is pruned to the lowest wire perhaps 15 to 18 inches above the ground. During the summer, buds lengthen into branches; one trained vertically to the next wire while others are trained along the wires. Unnecessary buds are removed by rubbing them away with a thumb. In autumn, the side branches are lowered and tied to the wires completing the level. The following year another level is created.

==Designs==
[[Image:SshapedEspalier.JPG|thumb|A vertical cordon fruit tree]]
[[File:01002stepoverbig.jpg|thumb|A stepover espalier with recently tied branches]]
Espalier design often uses traditional formal patterns developed over hundreds of years, but can also employ more modern informal designs.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  A stunted or deformed plant, or one that already has interesting or unique characteristics, might be just right for an informal espalier.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;

Common formal patterns include the following styles.
* V shaped: Tree is cut to a low wire 15 to 18&amp;nbsp;inches from the ground; two buds lengthen into branches which are attached to canes that keep them straight, and the canes are attached to another wire that maintains a V shape. The V shape is the first step in producing many other formal patterns.
* Belgian fence: More than one V shaped espaliers are planted two feet apart, so their branches cross, and are tied to a trellis.
* Stepover: A Horizontal espalier with only one set of branches tied to a wire around 15&amp;nbsp;inches above the ground. Start with a V shape until desired branch length is attained, but lower branches to the bottom wire by autumn of the first year. Takes only one year to produce the design from a well-rooted unbranched tree (it may take somewhat longer for it to start producing fruit).
* Horizontal T, also referred to as a horizontal cordon: Branches are trained horizontally along evenly spaced wires. Start with a V shape where a third bud is trained straight up to another wire. Train other two branches to stepover. In spring of second year prune the vertical stem to the second wire and again train to a V shape, etc. It takes one year per each level.
* [[Palmette]] or fan: Branches grow in a radiating pattern created when the branches of a V shaped espalier are cut back and lowered slightly. Multiple buds are coaxed to form branches that are tied to a trellis in a radiating pattern.
* Baldassari palmette: A palmette design created around 1950, used primarily for training peaches.
* [[Cordon (plant)|Cordon]]: Consists of a main stem with short [[fruiting spur]]s tied to a fence or a wire trellis. Probably the simplest and quickest espalier is the single vertical or angled cordon. The weakness of the vertical cordon is that it's difficult to rein in the vigor of the tree. An angled cordon reduces the vigor of its growth and increases fruit production.
* Verrier candelabra is a type of vertical cordon with multiple upright stems that usually starts from a V shape.
* Drapeau marchand: A cordon trained at an angle with the branches on its upper side trained to a right angle from the main stem.
* U double and other U shaped espalier is just another way of referring to a double vertical cordon.

==Plant selection, installation, and maintenance==
Espalier plants on solid walls are usually installed six to twelve inches from the base of that wall, to allow space below ground for roots to grow in all directions as well as space above ground for good air circulation and [[pest control]].&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  Supports for wire guides, which are generally necessary to train an espalier into a design, are installed first, directly into a wall constructed of suitable material.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  [[Masonry|Masonry walls]] are ideal for placing [[U-bolt]]s, eye bolts, or eye screws, anchored with either plastic plugs or expandable lead shields, directly into the mortar joints.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  Wooden walls may be better fitted with galvanized nipples, using turnbuckles for adjustment of the wire tautness.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;

Suitable, established and healthy plants, three to four feet tall and perhaps in three-gallon containers, are available from most [[Plant nursery|nurseries]].&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt; Some may even have trellises already installed. These plants could also be good candidates for espalier treatment if their form is similar to the intended design, as they frequently have already been pruned into a flattened overall plant shape.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  All that is required for such specimens is [[transplanting]].  Unpruned plants benefit from being allowed to become well established following transplant, before pruning them gradually into their flattened profile and training them as designed.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  Any major pruning needed is generally accomplished either while the plant is dormant or, for flowering plants, during the proper season for pruning that species.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;  Bending and training of the limbs that will remain in the design is done during the progression of the summer season, when they are most flexible.&lt;ref name=Powell/&gt;

'''Flight 19''' was the designation of a group of five [[Grumman TBF Avenger|Grumman TBM Avenger]] [[torpedo bomber]]s that [[List of aerial disappearances|disappeared]] over the [[Bermuda Triangle]] on December 5, 1945, after losing contact during a [[United States Navy]] overwater navigation training flight from [[Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale]], [[Florida]]. All 14 airmen on the [[Flight (military unit)|flight]] were lost, as were all 13 crew members of a [[Martin PBM Mariner]] [[flying boat]] that subsequently launched from [[Patrick AFB|Naval Air Station Banana River]] to search for Flight 19.  The PBM aircraft was known to accumulate flammable gasoline vapors in its bilges, and professional investigators have assumed that the PBM most likely exploded in mid-air while searching for the flight. Navy investigators could not determine the exact cause of the loss of Flight 19.

== Navigation training flight ==

Flight 19 undertook a routine navigation and combat training exercise in [[torpedo bomber|TBM-type aircraft]].&lt;ref name=NatGeoMayell&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1205_021205_bermudatriangle.html |title=Bermuda Triangle: Behind the Intrigue |work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |first=Hillary |last=Mayell |page=2 |date=December 15, 2003 |accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The assignment was called "Navigation problem No. 1", a combination of bombing and navigation, which other flights had completed or were scheduled to undertake that day.&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt; The flight leader was [[United States Navy]] [[Lieutenant]] Charles Carroll Taylor, who had about 2,500 flying hours, mostly in aircraft of this type, while his trainee pilots each had 300 total, and 60 flight hours in the Avenger.&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt; Taylor had completed a combat tour in the Pacific theatre as torpedo bomber pilot on the aircraft carrier {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|6}} and had recently arrived from [[Coast Guard Air Station Miami|NAS Miami]] where he had also been a VTB instructor. The student pilots had recently completed other training missions in the area where the flight was to take place.&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt; They were [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Captain (land)|Captain]]s Edward Joseph Powers and George William Stivers, U.S. Marine [[Second Lieutenant]] Forrest James Gerber and USN [[Ensign (rank)|Ensign]]  Joseph Tipton Bossi; their callsigns started with 'Fox Tare'.
 
The aircraft were four TBM-1Cs, BuNo 45714, 'FT3', BuNo 46094, 'FT36', BuNo 46325, 'FT81', BuNo 73209, 'FT117', and one TBM-3, BuNo 23307, 'FT28'. Each was fully fueled, and during pre-flight checks it was discovered they were all missing clocks. Navigation of the route was intended to teach [[dead reckoning]] principles, which involved calculating among other things elapsed time. The apparent lack of timekeeping equipment was not a cause for concern as it was assumed each man had his own watch. Takeoff was scheduled for 13:45 local time, but the late arrival of Taylor delayed departure until 14:10. Weather at NAS Fort Lauderdale was described as "favorable, sea state moderate to rough."&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt;  Taylor was supervising the mission, and a trainee pilot had the role of leader out front.
 	
Called "Naval Air Station, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, navigation problem No. 1,"&lt;ref name="hyper"/&gt; the exercise involved three different legs, but the actual flight should have flown four. After take off, they flew on heading 091° (almost due east) for {{convert|56|nmi|mi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} until reaching Hen and Chickens Shoals where low level bombing practice was carried out. The flight was to continue on that heading for another {{convert|67|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} before turning onto a course of 346° for {{convert|73|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}}, in the process over-flying [[Grand Bahama]] island. The next scheduled turn was to a heading of 241° to fly {{convert|120|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} at the end of which the exercise was completed and the Avengers would turn left to then return to NAS Ft. Lauderdale.&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt;

Radio conversations between the pilots were overheard by base and other aircraft in the area. The practice bombing operation is known to have been carried out because at about 15:00 a pilot requested and was given permission to drop his last bomb.&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt; Forty minutes later, another flight instructor, Lieutenant Robert F. Cox in FT-74, forming up with his group of students for the same mission, received an unidentified transmission.&lt;ref name="hyper"/&gt;
 
An unidentified crew member asked Powers, one of the students, for his compass reading. Powers replied: "I don't know where we are. We must have got lost after that last turn." Cox then transmitted; "This is FT-74, plane or boat calling 'Powers' please identify yourself so someone can help you." The response after a few moments was a request from the others in the flight for suggestions. FT-74 tried again and a man identified as FT-28 (Taylor) came on. "FT-28, this is FT-74, what is your trouble?" "Both of my compasses are out", Taylor replied, "and I am trying to find Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I am over land but it's broken. I am sure I'm in the Keys but I don't know how far down and I don't know how to get to Fort Lauderdale."&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt;
 	
FT-74 informed the NAS that aircraft were lost, then advised Taylor to put the sun on his [[Port (nautical)|port]] wing and fly north up the coast to Fort Lauderdale. Base operations then asked if the flight leader's aircraft was equipped with a standard YG ([[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] transmitter), which could be used to triangulate the flight's position, but the message was not acknowledged by FT-28. (Later he would indicate that his transmitter was activated.) Instead, at 16:45, FT-28 radioed: "We are heading 030 degrees for 45 minutes, then we will fly north to make sure we are not over the Gulf of Mexico." During this time no bearings could be made on the flight, and [[Identification friend or foe|IFF]] could not be picked up. Taylor was told to broadcast on 4805 [[kHz]]. This order was not acknowledged so he was asked to switch to 3000&amp;nbsp;kHz, the search and rescue frequency. Taylor replied – "I cannot switch frequencies. I must keep my planes intact."&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt;
 
At 16:56, Taylor was again asked to turn on his transmitter for [[Secondary surveillance radar|YG]] if he had one. He did not acknowledge but a few minutes later advised his flight "Change course to 090 degrees (due east) for 10 minutes." About the same time someone in the flight said "Dammit, if we could just fly west we would get home; head west, dammit."&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt; This difference of opinion later led to questions about why the students did not simply head west on their own.&lt;ref name=santafe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/35198.html |title=Flight 19 crew honored by House; disappearance began notion of Bermuda Triangle |work=Free New Mexican |first=Elisabeth |last=Goodridge |date=November 17, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126014843/http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/35198.html |archivedate=November 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been explained that this can be attributed to military discipline.&lt;ref name=santafe/&gt;
 	
As the weather deteriorated, radio contact became intermittent, and it was believed that the five aircraft were actually by that time more than {{convert|200|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} out to sea east of the Florida peninsula. Taylor radioed "We'll fly 270 degrees west until landfall or running out of gas" and requested a weather check at 17:24. By 17:50 several land-based radio stations had triangulated Flight 19's position as being within a {{convert|100|nmi|mi km|abbr=on}} radius of {{Coord|29|N|79|W}}; Flight 19 was north of the Bahamas and well off the coast of central Florida, but nobody  transmitted this information on an open, repetitive basis.
 
At 18:04, Taylor radioed to his flight "Holding 270, we didn't fly far enough east, we may as well just turn around and fly east again". By that time, the weather had deteriorated even more and the sun had since set. Around 18:20, Taylor's last message was received. (It has also been reported that Taylor's last message was received at 19:04.)&lt;ref name="MysBermTri2005"&gt;{{cite episode |title=Mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle |series=[[Decoding the Past]] |network=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] |season=1 |episode=16 |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was heard saying "All planes close up tight ... we'll have to ditch unless landfall ... when the first plane drops below 10 gallons, we all go down together."&lt;ref name=NatGeoMayell/&gt;&lt;ref name="NAN73"/&gt;

As it became obvious the flight was lost, air bases, aircraft, and merchant ships were alerted. A [[Consolidated PBY Catalina]] departed after 18:00 to search for Flight 19 and guide them back if they could be located.

At 21.15, the tanker SS ''Gaines Mills'' reported it had observed flames from an apparent explosion leaping {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and burning for 10 minutes, at position {{Coord|28.59|N|80.25|W}}.

== Investigation ==

A 500-page Navy board of investigation report published a few months later made several observations:

*Flight leader Lt. Charles C. Taylor had mistakenly believed that the small islands he passed over were the Florida Keys, so his flight was over the Gulf of Mexico and heading northeast would take them to Florida. It was determined that Taylor had passed over the Bahamas as scheduled, and he did in fact lead his flight to the northeast over the Atlantic. The report noted that some subordinate officers did likely know their approximate position as indicated by radio transmissions stating that flying west would result in reaching the mainland.
*Taylor was not at fault because the compasses stopped working.
*The loss of PBM-5 BuNo 59225 was attributed to an explosion.&lt;ref name="hyper"&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/rep/Flight19/index.html |title=Board of Investigation Into 5 Missing TBM Airplanes and One PBM Airplane Convened by Naval Air Advanced Training Command, NAS Jacksonville, Florida 7 December 1945 and Related Correspondence (Flight 19) |publisher=United States Navy ''via'' iBiblio.org |author=Naval Air Advanced Training Command Board of Inquiry |date=December 7, 1945 |accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This report was subsequently amended "cause unknown" by the Navy after Taylor's mother contended that the Navy was unfairly blaming her son for the loss of five aircraft and 14 men, when the Navy had neither the bodies nor the airplanes as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasflmuseum.com/flight-19.html|title=Flight 19 the Lost Avengers|first=Allan|last=McElhiney|date=|website=Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale Museum|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had Flight 19 actually been where Taylor believed it to be, the flight would have made landfall with the Florida coastline within 20 minutes, depending on how far down they were. However, a later reconstruction of the incident showed that the islands visible to Taylor were probably the Bahamas, well northeast of the Keys, and that Flight 19 was exactly where it should have been. The board of investigation found that because of his belief that he was on a base course toward Florida, Taylor actually guided the flight farther northeast and out to sea. Further, it was general knowledge at NAS Fort Lauderdale that if a pilot ever became lost in the area to fly a heading of 270° west (or in evening hours toward the sunset if the compass had failed). By the time the flight actually turned west, they were likely so far out to sea they had already passed their aircraft's fuel endurance. This factor combined with bad weather, and the ditching characteristics of the Avenger,&lt;ref name="NatGeoMayell"/&gt; meant that there was little hope of rescue, even if they had managed to stay afloat.

It is possible that Taylor overshot [[Castaway Cay]] and instead reached another land mass in southern [[Abaco Island]]. He then proceeded northwest as planned. He fully expected to find the [[Grand Bahama]] Island lying in front of him as expected. Instead, he eventually saw a land mass to his right side, the northern part of Abaco Island. Believing that this landmass to his right was the Grand Bahama Island and his compass was malfunctioning, he set a course to what he thought was southwest to head straight back to Fort Lauderdale. However, in reality this changed his course farther northwest, toward open ocean.

To further add to his confusion, he encountered a series of islands north of Abaco Island, which looks very similar to the [[Key West]] Islands. The control tower then suggested that Taylor's team should fly west, which would have taken them to the landmass of Florida eventually. Taylor headed for what he thought was west, but in reality was northwest, almost parallel to Florida.

After trying that for a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was impossible for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be in Key West since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Key West. When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.&lt;ref name=NatGeoNakedScience&gt;{{cite episode |title=Bermuda Triangle |series=[[Naked Science]] |network=[[National Geographic Channel]] |season=1 |episode=6 |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3107">In [[geology]], a '''forebulge''' is a flexural bulge in front of a load on the [[lithosphere]]. The load causes the lithosphere to flex by depressing the plate beneath it. Because of the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, the area around the load is uplifted by a height that is 4% of that of the depression under the load. The load and the resulting flexure place stress on the [[mantle (geology)|mantle]], causing it to flow into the area around the loaded area. The subsidence of the area under the load and the uplift of the forebulge continue until the load is in [[isostasy|isostatic]] equilibrium, a process that takes on the order of 10,000 to 20,000 years. Because of the coupling with the mantle, the rate of forebulge formation and collapse is controlled by mantle [[viscosity]].

==Glacial==

One cause for forebulge formation is loading of the continental lithosphere by [[ice sheet]]s during continental [[glaciation]]s. Because of the removal of the ice sheets, the formerly-glaciated areas are currently rising in a phenomenon known as [[post-glacial rebound]]. Because of the coupling of the mantle with the plates, data from [[post-glacial rebound]] are used as a direct probe of the viscosity of the upper mantle. As the ice melts and the land under it rises by isostatic recovery, the forebulge also subsides. Forebulge subsidence is the reason why the [[Netherlands]] and parts of southern England are still slowly sinking.&lt;ref&gt;p54 in ''[[Doggerland]]: a Speculative Survey'', by B.J.Coles, Proceedings of [[the Prehistoric Society]], #64 1998 pp 45-81.&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate is that the centre of the [[North Sea]] rose by about 170 m (558 ft) during the [[Last glacial period|Ice Age]] because of forebulging.&lt;ref&gt;''Glacial deposits of Britain and Europe: general overview'', by D.Ehlers, P.Gibbard, &amp; Tj.C.E van Weering, 1979: in ''Glacial Deposits in Britain and Ireland'', edited by J.Ehlers, P.Gibbard, &amp; J.Rose,  pp 493-501, Rotterdam: [[Balkema]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tectonic==
{{see also|Asunción arch}}
Collisions between [[tectonic plate]]s and [[island arc]]s lead to loading and flexure of the lithosphere. The flexure produces a significant forebulge, which divides a [[forearc]] basin and a [[back arc basin]].

==Physics==

The existence of a forebulge is predicted by the solution to the equations for the [[bending|flexure]] of a thin elastic beam or plate (the lithosphere). The magnitude of the flexure goes as an exponentially decaying [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]. The lithosphere is therefore anomalously high at a flexural half-wavelength past the load; the flexural wavelength is determined in large part by the elastic thickness of the lithosphere.

'''Geocaching''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|oʊ|ˌ|k|æ|ʃ|ɪ|ŋ}} is an outdoor recreational activity, in which participants use a [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) [[GPS navigation device|receiver]] or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called "geocaches" or "caches", at specific locations marked by coordinates all over the world.

A typical cache is a small waterproof container containing a [[logbook]] and sometimes a pen or pencil. The geocacher signs the log with their established code name and dates it, in order to prove that they found the cache. After signing the log, the cache must be placed back exactly where the person found it.  Larger containers such as plastic storage containers ([[Tupperware#Product lines|Tupperware]] or similar) or [[Ammo box|ammunition boxes]] can also contain items for trading, such as toys or trinkets, usually of more sentimental worth than financial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/geocaching/|title=geocaching|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2011-01-21|newspaper=[[National Geographic Society]]|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geocaching shares many aspects with [[Benchmarking (geolocating)|benchmarking]], [[Trigpointing#Trigpointing|trigpointing]], [[orienteering]], [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure-hunting]], [[Letterboxing (hobby)|letterboxing]], [[waymarking]] and [[Munzee]].

==History==
[[File:The location of the first Geocache, east of Portland.gif|thumb|A. 360° panoramic view of  the site of the first geocache, placed by Dave Ulmer. |225x225px]]

Geocaching was originally similar to the 160-year-old game [[Letterboxing (hobby)|letterboxing]], which uses clues and references to [[landmarks]] embedded in stories. Geocaching was conceived shortly after the removal of [[Selective Availability]] from the [[Global Positioning System]] on May 2, 2000, because the improved accuracy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps/performance/accuracy/ |title=U.S Government: GPS accuracy |publisher=Gps.gov |date=February 17, 2012 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the system allowed for a small container to be specifically placed and located. The first documented placement of a GPS-located cache took place on May 3, 2000, by Dave Ulmer of [[Beavercreek, Oregon|Beavercreek]], [[Oregon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/about/history.aspx|title=The History of Geocaching|last=|first=|date=|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=Groundspeak|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The location was posted on the [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]] sci.geo.satellite-nav&lt;ref name="Ulmer"&gt;{{cite newsgroup |title=GPS Stash Hunt... Stash #1 is there! |author=Dave Ulmer |date=May 3, 2000 |newsgroup=sci.geo.satellite-nav |message-id=02b45318.39d4645b@usw-ex0102-084.remarq.com |url=https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sci.geo.satellite-nav/mchHczyzVHo/p_SzccG87HgJ |accessdate=March 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at {{Coord|45|17.460|N|122|24.800|W |region:US-OR_type:landmark}}. Within three days, the cache had been found twice, first by Mike Teague. According to Dave Ulmer's message, this cache was a black plastic bucket that was partially buried and contained software, videos, books, money, a can of [[Baked beans|beans]], and a [[slingshot]].&lt;ref name="Ulmer"/&gt; The geocache and most of its contents were eventually destroyed by a [[lawn mower]]; the can of beans was the only item salvaged and was turned into a [[Trackable|trackable item]] called the "Original Can of Beans".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/track/details.aspx?id=83154|title=O.C.B.©|last=|first=|date=2003-09-07|website=Geocaching.com|access-date=2018-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another geocache and plaque called the Original Stash Tribute Plaque&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coord.info/GCGV0P|title=GCGV0P- Original Stash Tribute Plaque|last=|first=|date=2003-09-07|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=Geocaching HQ|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; now sit at the site.

The activity was originally referred to as the ''GPS stash hunt'' or ''gpsstashing.'' This was changed shortly after the original hide when it was suggested in the gpsstash [[eGroups|eGroup]] that "stash" could have negative connotations and the term ''geocaching'' was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cache vs Stash |first=Matt|last=Stum |date=May 30, 2000 |url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/gpsstash/message/62 |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] |accessdate=May 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, a variety of different hide-and-seek-type activities have been created or abandoned, so that "geocaching" may now refer to hiding and seeking containers, or locations or information without containers.

An independent accounting of the early history documents several controversial actions taken by Irish and Grounded, Inc., a predecessor to Groundspeak, to increase "commercialization and monopolistic control over the hobby".&lt;ref&gt;[http://geocaching.gpsgames.org/history/ The History of Geocaching] ''GPSgames.org;'' retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, other similar hobbies such as [[Munzee]] have attracted some geocachers by rapidly adopting smart-phone technology, which has caused "some resistance from geocaching organizers about placing caches along with munzees".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer|first=Susan|title=New game in town, Nerds gain more revenge with Munzee|url=http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121110/NEWS/111109916/1246|accessdate=January 20, 2013|newspaper=TELEGRAM &amp; GAZETTE|date=November 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geocaches==
[[File:Classic Geocache.jpg|thumb|A classic geocache – trade items in a military ammunition box.|225x225px]]
For the traditional geocache, a geocacher will place a waterproof container containing a log book (with [[pen]] and/or [[pencil]]) and trade items or trackables, then record the cache's [[Latitude and longitude|coordinates]]. These coordinates, along with other details of the location, are posted on a [[website|listing site]] (see list of some sites below). Other geocachers obtain the coordinates from that listing site and seek out the cache using their handheld GPS receivers. The finding geocachers record their exploits in the logbook and online, but then must return the cache to the same coordinates so that other geocachers may find it. Geocachers are free to take objects (except the logbook, pencil, or stamp) from the cache in exchange for leaving something of similar or higher value.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.countryfile.com/explore-countryside/beginners-guide-geocaching|title=The beginners' guide to geocaching|last=|first=|date=2015-02-12|website=|publisher=Countryfile Magazine|access-date=2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Geocaching Geocoin.png|left|thumb|An "Ace" [[Geocoin]].]]
Typical cache "treasures", also known in the geocaching world as swag,&lt;ref name="Geocaching"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/about/glossary.aspx|title=Glossary of Terms|last=|first=|date=|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=Groundspeak, Inc.|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not high in monetary value but may hold personal value to the finder.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aside from the logbook, common cache contents are unusual [[coin]]s or [[currency]], small toys, ornamental buttons, CDs, or books. Although not required, many geocachers decide to leave behind signature items, such as personal [[Geocoin]]s, pins, or craft items, to mark their presence at the cache location.&lt;ref name="Geocaching"/&gt; [[Disposable cameras]] are popular as they allow for anyone who found the cache to take a picture which can be developed and uploaded to a Geocaching web site listed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sherman|first1=Erik|title=Geocaching hike and seek with your gps|date=2004|publisher=APRESS|location=Berkeley|isbn=1-59059-122-4|page=19|edition=Steve Anglin}}&lt;!--|accessdate=23 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Also common are objects that are moved from cache to cache called "hitchhikers", such as [[Travel Bug]]s or [[Geocoin]]s, whose travels may be logged and followed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.richmond-news.com/news/weekly-feature/pokemon-who-richmond-geocachers-are-the-real-life-scavenger-hunters-1.2326716|title=Pokemon who? Richmond geocachers are the real life scavenger hunters|last=News|first=Hedy Ng/Special to the|newspaper=Richmond News|access-date=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cachers who initially place a Travel Bug or Geocoins often assign specific goals for their trackable items. Examples of goals are to be placed in a certain cache a long distance from home, or to travel to a certain country, or to travel faster and farther than other hitchhikers in a race. Less common trends are site-specific information pages about the historic significance of the site, types of trees, birds in the area or other such information. Higher-value items are occasionally included in geocaches as a reward for the First to Find (called "FTF"), or in locations which are harder to reach. [[File:Food in geocache.jpg|thumb|A granola bar in a geocache in England. Even if sealed, food is not allowed in geocaches, as it is considered unhygienic and can attract animals.]] Dangerous or illegal items, weapons, food and drugs are not allowed and are specifically against the rules of most geocache listing sites.

If a geocache has been vandalized or stolen, it is said to have been "muggled". The former term plays off the fact that those not familiar with geocaching are called [[muggle]]s, a term borrowed from the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series of books which was rising in popularity at the same time geocaching got its start.&lt;ref name="Geocaching" /&gt;

===Variations===
Traditional geocaching gave birth to [[Encounter (game)#GeoCaching|GeoCaching]] – an active urban game of the [[Encounter (game)|Encounter]] project. The game is quite similar to geocaching but has time limitations and hints.

Geocaches vary in size, difficulty, and location. Simple caches that are placed near a roadside are often called "drive-bys", "park 'n grabs" (PNGs), or "cache and dash". Geocaches may also be complex, involving lengthy searches, significant travel, or use of specialist equipment such as [[SCUBA diving]], [[kayaking]], or [[abseiling]].  Different geocaching websites list different variations per their own policies.
[[File:Geocache containers range.jpg|thumb|Geocaches come in a range of sizes. Top: a [[magnetic nano]] geocache in the [[City of London]]. &lt;Br/&gt; 
 Bottom: A large bucket geocache in the [[Czech Republic]].]]
Container sizes range from "nanos", particularly [[magnetic nano]]s, which can be smaller than the tip of a finger and have only enough room to store the log sheet, to 20-liter (5 gallon) buckets or even larger containers, such as entire trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geocaching.com/blog/2015/06/gigantesque-the-big-one-gc5q8n-geocache-of-the-week/ | title=gigantesque – The Big One (GC5Q8N) – Geocache of the Week | first=Derek | last=H | date=June 25, 2015 | accessdate=June 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common cache containers in rural areas are lunch-box-sized plastic storage containers or surplus military ammunition cans. [[ammunition box|Ammo cans]] are considered the gold standard of containers because they are very sturdy, waterproof, animal- and fire-resistant, relatively cheap, and have plenty of room for trade items. Smaller containers are more common in urban areas because they can be more easily hidden.

Caches can be grouped in three categories – with and without a paper log, and events.

The following types do not have paper logs.

=== Geocache types ===
A '''BIT Cache''' is a laminated card with a QR code, similar to [[Munzee]]. The BIT Cache also contains a URL and a password, for logging purposes. They are listed exclusively on opencaching.us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=OPENCACHING Geocaching in North America |url=http://www.opencaching.us/ |title=opencaching.us |publisher=opencaching.us |date= |accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cache Parameters"&gt;[http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Cache_parameters Cache Parameters], ''Wiki.opencaching.us;'' retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitcaching.com/ BITcaching.com], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Virtual Cache.JPG|thumb|A Geocacher finding a Virtual Cache at [[McMurdo Station]], [[Antarctica]].|225x225px]]

'''Virtual caches''' are coordinates for a location, which has some other described object. Validation for finding a virtual cache generally requires one to email the cache hider with information such as a date or a name on a plaque, or to post a picture of oneself at the site with GPS receiver in hand.&lt;ref name="geo_types"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/about/cache_types.aspx|title=Geocache types|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=geocaching.com|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; New virtual caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,&lt;ref name="geocaching.com"&gt;[http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx Geocache Listing Requirements / Guidelines], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; but they remain supported by other sites.&lt;ref name="Cache Parameters"/&gt;

'''Earthcaches''' are virtual caches that are organized by the [[Geological Society of America]]. The cacher usually has to perform a task which teaches him/her an educational lesson about the earth science of the cache area.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

'''Locationless/Reverse caches''' are similar to a [[scavenger hunt]]. A description is given for something to find, such as a one-room schoolhouse, and the finder locates an example of this object. The finder records the location using their GPS receiver and often takes a picture at the location showing the named object and his or her GPS receiver. Typically others are not allowed to log that same location as a find.

'''Webcam caches''' are virtual caches whose coordinates have a public [[webcam]]. The finder is often required to capture their image from the webcam for verification of the find.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt; New webcam caches are no longer allowed by Groundspeak,&lt;ref name="geocaching.com"/&gt; but they remain supported by other sites.&lt;ref name="Cache Parameters"/&gt;

Finally, a '''USB Cache''' or '''[[USB dead drop|Dead Drop]] cache'''&lt;ref name="Cache Parameters" /&gt; location has a USB drive embedded (with permission) into walls or other structures. The cache is retrieved by connecting a device that has a USB port and that is able to read standard text files.

The following types have logs, at least at the final location.

A '''Multi-cache''' consists of multiple discoveries of one or more intermediate points containing the coordinates for the next stage; the final stage contains the log book. An '''Offset cache''' is a multi-cache in which the initial coordinates are for a location containing information that encodes the final cache coordinates. An example would be to direct the finder to a plaque where the digits of a date on the plaque correspond to coordinates of the final cache.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

A '''Night Cache''' is multi-stage and intended to be found at night by following a series of reflectors with a flashlight to the final cache location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=69|title=Night and UV Caches|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Groundspeak Support|access-date=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Chirp Cache''' is a Garmin-created innovative advance on multi caches using new wireless beacon technology.  The Chirp stores hints, multicache coordinates, counts visitors and confirms the cache is nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://garmin.blogs.com/my_weblog/2010/10/garmin-chirp-brings-geocachers-even-more-creativity-connectivity.html Garmin chirp Brings Geocachers Even More Creativity, Connectivity], published October 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://buy.garmin.com/shop/shop.do?pID=74811&amp;pvID=75243 Garmin Chirp], retrieved January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; These caches were fully supported at OpenCaching.com, but they caused considerable discussion and some controversy at Groundspeak, where they were given a new "attribute".&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.groundspeak.com/GC/index.php?showtopic=261919&amp;st=150&amp;p=4504653&amp;#entry4504653 Garmin Chirp- Geocaching Beacon], retrieved January 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A [[Wherigo]] cache''' is a multi-stage cache hunt that uses a Wherigo "cartridge" to guide the player to find a physical cache sometime during cartridge play, usually at the end. Not all Wherigo cartridges incorporate geocaches into game play. Wherigo caches are unique to the geocaching.com website.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

'''Guest Book Caches''' use guest books often found in museums, tourist information centers, etc. They are listed exclusively at Opencaching.us.&lt;ref name="Cache Parameters"/&gt;

A '''[[letterboxing (hobby)|Letterbox]] Hybrid Cache''' is a combination of a geocache and a letterbox in the same container. A letterbox has a rubber stamp and a logbook instead of tradable items. Letterboxers carry their own stamp with them, to stamp the letterbox's log book and inversely stamp their personal log book with the letterbox stamp. The hybrid cache contains the important materials for this and may or may not include trade items. Whether the letterbox hybrid contains trade items is up to the owner.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

'''Moving/Travelling caches''' are found at a listed set of coordinates. The finder hides the cache in a different location, and updates the listing, essentially becomes the hider, and the next finder continues the cycle. This cache type is supported by multiple sites.&lt;ref name="Cache Parameters"/&gt;

'''Mystery/puzzle caches''' require one to discover information or solve a puzzle to find the cache. Some mystery caches provide a false set of coordinates with a puzzle that must be solved to determine the final cache location. In other cases, the given location is accurate, but the name of the location or other features are themselves a puzzle leading to the final cache. Alternatively, additional information is necessary to complete the find, such as a padlock combination to access the cache.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt; Finally, '''Challenge Caches''', (a subtype of the '''Mystery cache''') require a geocacher to complete a reasonably attainable geocaching-related task before being able to log the find. Examples include finding a number of caches that meet a category, completing a number of cache finds within a period of time, or finding a cache for every calendar day, etc.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

{{Anchor|eventcache}}
There are a few kinds of events.

An '''Event Cache''' is a gathering organized and attended by geocachers.&lt;ref name="geo_types" /&gt;

'''Cache-In Trash-Out (CITO) Events''' are coordinated activities of trash pickup and other maintenance tasks (such as constructing footpaths, planting trees and removing invasive species) to improve the environment.&lt;ref name="geo_types" /&gt; CITO is an ongoing environmental initiative created by Groundspeak Inc. related to geocaching which encourages geocachers to clean up parks and other areas.&lt;ref name="geo_types" /&gt; This is done in two ways: specific events, traditionally around the time of [[Earth Day]] each year,&lt;ref name="CITO video link on geocaching blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.geocaching.com/2010/05/geocaching-coms-lost-found-video-cache-in-trash-out/|title=Cache In Trash Out – Geocaching.com’s Lost &amp; Found Video|last=Schudiske|first=Eric|date=May 25, 2010|publisher=blog.geocaching.com|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which groups go around picking up [[litter]] and maintaining the landscape while finding geocaches.&lt;ref name="Page on geocaching.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/cito/|title=Geocaching &gt; Cache In Trash Out|publisher=geocaching.com|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/geocaching-photos_n_5850714|title=Oh The Places You'll Go: Geocaching Takes Adventurers To Beautiful, New Spots Every Day|last=Boehrer, McGonial|first=Katherine, Chris|date=2014-09-28|work=[[Huffington Post]]|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Mega Event''' is defined by attendance of over 500 people. Mega Events are typically annual events, usually attracting geocachers from all over the world.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

A '''Giga Event''' is an event with an attendance of over 5000 people, also attracting geocachers from worldwide.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

Finally, a '''GPS Adventures Maze Exhibit''' is an exhibit at various museums and science centers in which participants in the maze learn about geocaching. These "events" have their own cache type on Geocaching.com and include many non-geocachers.&lt;ref name = "geo_types"/&gt;

====Geodashing====
Geodashing is an outdoor [[sport]] in which teams of players use [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receivers to find and visit randomly selected "dashpoints" (also called "waypoints") around the world and report what they find. The objective is to visit as many dashpoints as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schmidt | first=Jeremy |date=January 6, 2002| title=Scavenger hunts turn high-tech| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| page= H4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tipton| first=Nancy |date=July 24, 2005|title= In search of cache| work= [[Albuquerque Journal]]| page= 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike geocaching, nothing is to be left at the dashpoints; the sole objective is to visit them within the time limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsgames.org/cgi-bin/gpswiki.pl?GeodashingIntro |title=Introduction to Geodashing |publisher=Gpsgames.org |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lange|first= Linda |date=February 9, 2003|title= A global treasure hunt| work=[[Knoxville News Sentinel]]| page= F2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game, organized by gpsgames.org,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org |title=gpsgames.org |publisher=gpsgames.org |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ran for two months (June and July 2001); each subsequent game has run for one month. Players are often encouraged to take pictures at the dashpoints and upload them to the site.

====Stratocaching====
Geocaching from space is a combination of flight to near space, the geocaching game, and a unique science experiment. The first Stratocaching event was held on 16 November 2013 in Prague and was successful. Ten caches and two "radioseeds" went up to {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} into the stratosphere on a gondola called Dropion module carried by a high-altitude balloon. The caches and seeds then fell to earth for people to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.idnes.cz/first-stratocaching-2013-prague-czech-republic-geocaching-near-space-game-13m-/tec_vesmir.aspx?c=A131118_172217_tec_vesmir_pka|title=VIDEO: First Stratocaching attracted 200k Czechs with a near-space treasure hunt|author=Pavel Kasík|date=November 18, 2013|work=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXTvBBQfLfE|title=Stratocaching (EN)|date=November 15, 2013|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technet.idnes.cz/stratocaching-geocaching-from-space-experiment-prague-czech-republic-1kk-/tec_vesmir.aspx?c=A131115_171153_tec_vesmir_pka|title=New GPS game is out of this world: Czechs are introducing Stratocaching|author=Pavel Kasík|date=November 15, 2013|work=iDNES.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

===Obtaining data===
GPX files containing information such as a cache description and information about recent visitors to the cache are available from various listing sites. Geocachers may upload geocache data (also known as [[waypoint]]s) from various websites in various formats, most commonly in file-type [[GPX (data transfer)|GPX]], which uses [[XML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GPX: The GPS Exchange Format |url=http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp |accessdate=July 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some websites allow geocachers to search (build queries) for multiple caches within a geographic area based on criteria such as [[ZIP code]] or [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]], downloading the results as an email attachment on a schedule. In recent years, Android and iPhone users have been able to download apps such as GeoBeagle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=geobeagleteam|title=GeoBeagle: an Android app for geocaching and letterboxing|url=https://code.google.com/p/geobeagle/|work=Google codes projects|publisher=Google Project Hosting|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow them to use their 3G and GPS-enabled devices to actively search for and download new caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bardua|first=Joachim|title=GeoBeagle – Geocaching Apps für Android Smartphones (5) (GeoBeagle - Geocaching apps for Android smartphones (5))|url=http://www.navigation-professionell.de/geobeagle-geocaching-apps-fur-android-smartphones-5/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Navigation-Professionell|date=May 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cutler|first=Kim-Mai|title=Augmented reality meets scavenger hunt with GeoBeagle, Wikitude|url=https://venturebeat.com/2009/08/09/augmented-reality-meets-scavenger-hunt-with-geobeagle-wikitude/|accessdate=January 22, 2013|newspaper=Venturebeat|date=August 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Converting and filtering data===
A variety of geocaching applications are available for geocache data management, file-type translation, and personalization. Geocaching [[software]] can assign special icons or search (filter) for caches based on certain criteria (e.g. distance from an assigned point, difficulty, date last found).

[[File:GeoCache and GPSr.jpg|thumb|Coordinates for a geocache can be downloaded onto a GPS receiver and found, without the need for a printout.]]

'''Paperless geocaching''' means hunting a geocache without a physical printout of the cache description. Traditionally, this means that the seeker has an electronic means of viewing the cache information in the field, such as pre-downloading the information to a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] or other electronic device. Various applications are able to directly upload and read [[GPS eXchange Format|GPX]] files without further conversion. Newer GPS devices released by [[Garmin]], [[DeLorme]] and [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]] have the ability to read GPX files directly, thus eliminating the need for a [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html |title=Outdoor-Navigation mit dem Garmin Colorado 300 |date=April 1, 2008 |publisher=connect.de |page=1 |language=German |accessdate=November 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220202659/http://www.connect.de/themen_spezial/Outdoor-Navigation-mit-dem-Garmin-Colorado-300_1596951.html |archivedate=December 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods include viewing real-time information on a portable computer with internet access or with a Internet-enabled smart phone. The latest advancement of this practice involves installing dedicated applications on a smart phone with a built-in GPS receiver. Seekers can search for and download caches in their immediate vicinity directly to the application and use the on-board GPS receiver to find the cache.

A more controversial version of paperless caching involves mass-downloading only the coordinates and cache names (or waypoint IDs) for hundreds of caches into older receivers. This is a common practice of some cachers and has been used successfully for years. In many cases, however, the cache description and hint are never read by the seeker before hunting the cache. This means they are unaware of potential restrictions such as limited hunt times, park open/close times, off-limit areas, and suggested parking locations.

==Ethics==
Geocache listing websites have their own guidelines for acceptable geocache publications. Government agencies and others responsible for public use of land often publish guidelines for geocaching, and a "Geocacher's Creed" posted on the Internet asks participants to "avoid causing disruptions or public alarm".&lt;ref name="WP070927"&gt;Fredrick Kunkle, ''[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/26/AR2007092600843_pf.html Geocaching Craze Pushes Officials To Set Guidelines]'', [[Washington Post]], September 27, 2007.

==Reception==
{{globalize/US|section|date=August 2015}}
The reception from authorities and the general public outside geocache participants has been mixed to hostile.

The placement of geocaches has occasional critics among some government personnel and the public at large who consider it littering.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backpacker.com/skills/navigation/does-geocaching-violate-leave-no-trace/amp/|title=Does Geocaching Violate Leave No Trace? - Backpacker|date=2008-05-07|newspaper=Backpacker|access-date=2016-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202050402/http://www.backpacker.com/skills/navigation/does-geocaching-violate-leave-no-trace/amp/|archivedate=February 2, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.100peaks.com/blog/2012/12/22/geocaching-organized-littering|title=Geocaching - Organised Littering?|last=Loranger|first=Derek|date=2012-12-22|website=100 Peaks|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some geocachers act to mitigate this perception by picking up litter while they search for geocaches, a practice referred to in the community as "Cache In Trash Out".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Events and caches are often organized revolving around this practice, with many areas seeing significant cleanup that would otherwise not take place, or would instead require federal, state or local funds to accomplish. Geocachers are also encouraged to clean up after themselves by retrieving old containers once a cache has been removed from play.

Geocaching is legal in every country except North Korea (where GPS and all other mobile devices are illegal to possess)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2012/02/geocaching-steps-into-north-korea/|title=Geocaching Steps into North Korea|date=2012-02-17|newspaper=The Geocaching Blog|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is usually positively received when explained to law enforcement officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2013/09/advice-to-geocache-hiders-from-law-enforcement/|title=Advice to Geocache Hiders from Law Enforcement|date=2013-09-04|newspaper=The Geocaching Blog|access-date=2016-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain types of placements can be problematic. Although generally disallowed, hiders could place caches on private property without adequate permission (intentionally or otherwise), which encourages cache finders to trespass. Caches might also be hidden in places where the act of searching can make a finder look suspicious (e.g. near schools, children's playgrounds, banks, courthouses, or in residential neighborhoods), or where the container placement could be mistaken for a [[drug]] stash or a [[bomb]] (especially in urban settings, under bridges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2011/06/03/police-search-for-gamer-who-hung-geocache-from-railroad-overpass/|title=Police Search For Gamer Who Hung Geocache From Railroad Overpass|date=June 3, 2011|newspaper=The Naperville Sun and CBS Chicago|accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; near banks, courthouses, or embassies). As a result, geocachers are strongly advised to label their geocaches where possible, so that they are not mistaken for a harmful object if discovered by non-geocachers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gagb.org.uk/cache-labels.php|title=GAGB Geocache labels|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Geocaching Association of Great Britain|access-date=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Geocache.jpg|thumb|A geocache that has been clearly labelled, in order to clarify that the container is harmless in an attempt to reduce alarm if accidentally discovered.]]
As well as concerns about littering and bomb threats, some geocachers hide their caches in inappropriate locations, such as electrical boxes, that may encourage risky behaviour, especially amongst children. Hides in these areas are discouraged,&lt;ref name="Mike Vogel" /&gt; and cache listing websites enforce guidelines that disallow certain types of placements. However, as cache reviewers typically cannot see exactly where and how every particular cache is hidden, problematic hides can slip through. Ultimately it is also up to cache finders to use discretion when attempting to search for a cache, and report any problems.

Regional rules for placement of caches have become quite complex. For example, in Virginia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.groundspeak.com/display/GEO/Virginia Groundspeak's Wiki for Virginia's land management policies], retrieved January 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; the Virginia Department of Transportation and the Wildlife Management Agency now forbids the placement of geocaches on all land controlled by those agencies. Some cities, towns and recreation areas allow geocaches with few or no restrictions, but others require compliance with lengthy permitting procedures.

The [[South Carolina House of Representatives]] passed Bill 3777&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scstatehouse.gov/sess116_2005-2006/bills/3777.htm 2005–2006 Bill 3777: Geocache, geocaching, and letterboxing] South Carolina Legislature Online&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005, stating, "It is unlawful for a person to engage in the activity of geocaching or letterboxing in a cemetery or in an historic or archeological site or property publicly identified by an historical marker without the express written consent of the owner or entity which oversees that cemetery site or property." The bill was referred to committee on first reading in the Senate and has been there ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecolumbiastar.com/news/2005-05-20/Front_Page/001.html|title=High–tech scavenger hunt Geocachers invade hallowed ground|last=Haynie|first=Rachel|date=May 20, 2005|publisher=Columbia Star|accessdate=March 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three adult geocachers, a 24-year-old woman and her parents, were trapped in a cave and rescued by firefighters in Rochester, New York, while searching for an ammo can in 2012. Rochester Fire Department spokesman Lt.

In 2015, the [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|coastguard]] were called to a group of geocachers who were spotted walking into the [[Severn Estuary]] off the coast of [[Clevedon]], England, in search of clues to a multi-cache.

==Websites and data ownership==
Numerous websites list geocaches around the world. Geocaching websites vary in many ways, including control of data.

===First page===
The first website to list geocaches was announced by Mike Teague on May 8, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Geocaching---Early-History-295308.html|title=Geocaching - Early History - Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713220930/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/subtopics/Geocaching---Early-History-295308.html|archivedate=July 13, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 2000, Jeremy Irish emailed the gpsstash mailing list that he had registered the domain name geocaching.com and had set up his own Web site. He copied the caches from Mike Teague's database into his own. On September 6, Mike Teague announced that Jeremy Irish was taking over cache listings. {{as of|2012}}, Teague had logged only 5 caches.&lt;ref name="Teague"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awesomegeocaching.com/2012/08/14/interview-mike-teague-on-the-first-geocache-listing-site/|title=Interview: Mike Teague On The First Geocache Listing Site|date=August 14, 2012|work=Awesome Geocaching|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest site is Geocaching.com, owned by Groundspeak Inc., which began operating in late 2000. With a worldwide membership and a [[freemium]] business model, the website claims millions of caches and members in over 200 countries. Hides and events are reviewed by volunteer regional cache reviewers before publication. Free membership allows users access to coordinates, descriptions, and logs for some caches; for a fee, users are allowed additional search tools, the ability to download large amounts of cache information onto their gps at once, instant email notifications about new caches, and access to premium-member-only caches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geocaching.com/premium/ Geocaching.com's Premium Membership Benefits] Retrieved June 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Grandfathering of virtual geocaches ====
The website no longer lists new caches without a physical container, including virtual and webcam caches; however, older caches of these types have been [[Grandfather clause|grandfathered]] in (except for locationless/reverse, which are completely archived). On August 24, 2017, Groundspeak announced "Virtual Rewards", allowing 4000 new virtual caches to be placed during the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/blog/2017/08/virtual-rewards/ |title=Virtual Rewards |publisher=geocaching.com |accessdate=November 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earthcaches are one of the two exceptions to the no-container rule; they are caches in which players must answer geological questions to complete the cache. The other exception is for event caches; for an event to qualify, it must be specifically or mainly for geocachers, and must have a minimum duration dependent upon its category (CITO, regular, Mega, or Giga).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.chapter&amp;id=23 |title=Calendars and Events (regular, mega, CITO) |publisher=Groundspeak.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees of event caches can log that they 'attended', which will increment their number of found caches. Groundspeak created a waymarking website to handle all other non-physical caches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=401 |title=Virtual Geocaches |publisher=Groundspeak.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Size classifications ====
Geocaching.com has its own geocache size classification scale; geocachers must pick a size from one of the options before submitting a geocache listing through the website. The sizes are:

* '''Micro/Extra Small:''' Less than 100 millilitres in volume. These are usually the size of/are a film canister.
* '''Small:''' Large enough to hold a logbook and small items; more than 100 millilitres but less than 1 litre in volume. These are usually the size of/are a sandwich box.
* '''Regular/Medium:''' Between 1 and 20 litres in volume. These are usually the size of/are a shoebox, and many of these can be ammo cans.
* '''Large:''' More than 20 litres in volume. These can be buckets, bins or old railroad freight cars.
* '''Other:''' A size that doesn't fit into these categories, or where the cache owner doesn't wish to provide a size clue.
* '''Virtual:''' For virtual cache types, as there is no physical container.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=75|title=4.2. Cache containers explained|last=|first=|date=|website=support.groundspeak.com|publisher=Groundspeak Support|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Difficulty/Terrain Rating ====

Like size rating, the difficulty and terrain rating of a geocache must be selected from a scale before submitting a listing through the site. Geocachers must select the difficulty star rating  from a scale between 1 and 5 stars, increasing in half a star increments, where 1 is the easiest and 5 is the most difficult.  Terrain must also be rated on the same scale, with 1 being the most accessible flat ground, and 5 involving specialist equipment such as SCUBA or rock climbing gear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://support.groundspeak.com/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=82|title=Ratings for difficulty and terrain|last=|first=|date=|website=support.groundspeak.com|publisher=Groundspeak Support|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Travel Bugs ====

[[File:To the Moon, Alice.jpg|thumb|Geocaching Travel Bug named 'To the Moon, Alice'. Dog Tag to the left of Snoopy]] 
Another feature of the game are Travel Bugs. These are objects attached to a tracking tag that looks like a military dog tag. Technically the dog tag is the "travel bug" and the attached object is called the "hitchhiker" but everyone calls the combination a Travel Bug. The tracking tags come from Geocaching.com. You add your own traveler. The original concept was, a geocacher picks up a Bug from one geocache (usually just called a 'cache' by geocachers) and leaves it in another (it's how they travel). Travel Bugs have their own page on the website where owners can define a mission for the bug. For example, the bug in the picture's mission was to go to the moon, but in the meantime to visit every state in the continental U.S. according to a specific pattern. People who move a bug go to the bug's page to record the move using the tracking number on the dog tag. If it's in the bug's mission, and the owner is lucky, their bug can travel all over the world. They're notified of every place it stops and can view any pictures the cacher who moved it might have added.

A while ago the ability was added to "discover" Travel Bugs. Now, you can record the tracking number while at the cache the bug is in (picture with cell phone is common) then on its page log that you discovered it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/track/travelbugfaq.aspx |title=Travel Bug® FAQ
|last=|first=|date=|website= geocaching.com |publisher=|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Benchmarking ====
The website also supports the discovery of [[Benchmarking (geolocating)|benchmarks]] in the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/mark/#Whatis |title=Benchmark Hunting |publisher=Geocaching.com |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently no benchmarks outside the USA in its database. The website provides the best known longitude and latitude (sometimes accurate to within only six or more seconds) of the object along with a description. Hunters use the clues to try to find the benchmark; the benchmark can be logged as Found, Not Found, Note, or Destroyed. The "Destroyed" log should be used only if there is evidence that the mark has been permanently destroyed.

NOTE: The Geocaching.com benchmark data has not been updated in 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/mark/#logkinds |title=Benchmark hunting FAQ |publisher=geocaching.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Extraterrestrial geocaches ====
Groundspeak allows extraterrestrial caches, e.g. the [[Moon]] or [[Mars]], although presently, the website provides only earthbound coordinates. Thus the cache that exists on the [[International Space Station]], GC1BE91,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=gc1be91|title=GC1BE91 International Space Station|last=|first=|date=|website=Geocaching.com|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the launch area [[Baikonur]] in Kazakhstan as its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocaching.com/map/#?ll=45.95357,63.34176&amp;z=14 |title=Geocaching map |publisher=geocaching.com |accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Apps ====
The site promotes mobile applications, and lists over two dozen applications (both mobile and browser/desktop based) that are using their [[proprietary software|proprietary]] but [[royalty-free]] public API.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geocaching.com/mobile/partners/|title=Geocaching &gt; API Partner Applications|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2017-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Developers at c:geo have criticised Groundspeak for being incompatible with open-source development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faq.cgeo.org/#1_21|title=c:geo – FAQ|last=|first=|date=|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-17|work=cgeo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opencaching Network===
[[File:Riverside Cache - not FTF.jpg|thumb|A geocache hidden through Opencaching.com]]
The Opencaching Network provides independent, non-commercial listing sites based in the cacher's country or region. The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge for the use of the sites, the service being community driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published and although cross-listing is permitted, it is discouraged. Some listings are listed on other sites, but there are many that are unique to the Opencaching Network. Features include the ability to organize one's favourite caches, build custom searches, be instantly notified of new caches in one's area, seek and create caches of all types, export GPX queries, statpics, etc. Each Opencaching Node provides the same API for free (called "OKAPI"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/opencaching/okapi |title=Opencaching Network API |accessdate=February 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) for use by developers who want to create third-party applications able to use the Opencaching Network's content.

Countries with associated opencaching websites include the United States at www.opencaching.us; Germany at www.opencaching.de;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gründel|first=Markus|title=Geocaching: Basiswissen für Draussen|publisher=Conrad Stein Verlag, GmbH|isbn=3866862725|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sweden at www.opencaching.se; Poland at www.opencaching.pl; Czech Republic at www.opencaching.cz; Norway at www.opencaching.no; The Netherlands at www.opencaching.nl; Romania at www.opencaching.ro; the United Kingdom at www.opencaching.org.uk.&lt;ref name="OpenCaching United States Wiki"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.opencaching.us/index.php/Main_Page|title=OpenCaching United States Wiki|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between opencaching and traditional listing sites is that all services are open to the users at no cost. Generally, most geocaching services or websites offer some basic information for free, but users may have to pay for premium membership that allows access to more information or advanced searching capabilities. This is not the case with opencaching; every geocache is listed and accessible to everyone for free.&lt;ref name="OpenCaching United States Wiki"/&gt;

Additionally, Opencaching sites allow users to rate and report on existing geocaches. This allows users to see what other cachers think of the cache and it encourages participants to place higher quality caches. The rating system also greatly reduces the problem of abandoned or unsatisfactory caches still being listed after repeated negative comments or posts in the cache logs.&lt;ref name="OpenCaching United States Wiki"/&gt;

===OpenCaching.com===
OpenCaching.com (short: OX) was a site created and run by Garmin from 2010-2015, which had the stated aim of being as free and open as possible with no paid content. Caches were approved by a community process and coordinates were available without an account. The service closed on 14 August 2015.

===Other sites===
In many countries there are regional geocaching sites, but these mostly only compile lists of caches in the area from the three main sites. Many of them also accept unique listings of caches for their site, but these listings tend to be less popular than the international sites, although occasionally the regional sites may have more caches than the international sites. There are some exceptions though, e.g. in the former [[Soviet Union]], the site Geocaching[[.su]] remains popular because it accepts listings in the [[Cyrillic script]]. Additional international sites include Geocaching.de, a German website, and Geocaching Australia, which accepts listings of cache types deprecated by geocaching.com, cache types such as TrigPoint and Moveable caches, as well as traditional geocache types.

====GPSgames====
GPSgames.org is an online community dedicated to all kinds of games involving Global Positioning System receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/content/blogsection/9/59/|title=About GPSgames.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSgames.org allows traditional geocaches as well as virtual, locationless, and traveler geocaches. Geodashing, Shutterspot, GeoVexilla, MinuteWar, GeoPoker, and GeoGolf are among the GPS games available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/content/section/3/57/|title=GPS Games|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; GPSgames.org has been 100% free since 2001, through donations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsgames.org/|title=GPSgames.org|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====NaviCache====
Navicache.com started as a regional listing service in 2001.&lt;ref name="The Rebirth Of Navicaching"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notaboutthenumbers.com/2012/06/05/the-rebirth-of-navicaching/|title=The Rebirth Of Navicaching|date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many of the website's listings have been posted to other sites, it also offers unique listings. The website lists nearly any type of geocache and does not charge to access any of the caches listed in its database. All submissions are reviewed and approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navicache.com/cgi-bin/db/faq.google2.wap.pl|title=Navicache Geocaching FAQ|accessdate=January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Navicache is under transition to new owners, who said they "plan to develop a site that geocachers want, with rules that geocachers think are suitable. Geocaching.com and OX are both backed by large enterprises, and while that means they have more funding and people, we’re a much smaller team – so our advantage is the ability to be dynamic and listen to the users."&lt;ref name="The Rebirth Of Navicaching"/&gt;

====TerraCaching====
Terracaching.com seeks to provide high-quality caches made so by the difficulty of the hide or from the quality of the location. Membership is managed through a sponsorship system, and each cache is under continual peer review from other members. Terracaching.com embraces virtual caches alongside traditional or multi-stage caches and includes many locationless caches among the thousands of caches in its database. It is increasingly attracting members who like the point system. In Europe, TerraCaching is supported by Terracaching.eu. This site is translated in different European languages, has an extended FAQ and extra supporting tools for TerraCaching. TerraCaching strongly discourages caches that are listed on other sites (so-called double-listing).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terracaching.com/|title=Welcome to TerraCaching.com|accessdate= January 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Greece}}

The traditional '''geographic regions of Greece''' ({{lang-el|γεωγραφικά διαμερίσματα}}, literally "geographic departments") are the country's main historical-geographic regions, and were also official administrative [[subdivisions of Greece|regional subdivisions]] of [[Greece]] until the 1987 administrative reform.&lt;ref&gt;Π.Δ. 51/87 "Καθορισμός των Περιφερειών της Χώρας για το σχεδιασμό κ.λ.π. της Περιφερειακής Ανάπτυξης" (''Determination of the Regions of the Country for the planning etc. of regional development, [[Efimeris tis Kyverniseos|ΦΕΚ]] A 26/06.03.1987&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their replacement as first-level administrative units by the newly defined [[administrative regions of Greece|administrative regions]] ({{lang-el|περιφέρειες}}), the nine traditional geographic divisions—six on the mainland and three island groups—are still widely referred to in unofficial contexts and in daily discourse.

As of 2011, the  official [[administrative divisions of Greece]] consist of 13 regions ({{lang-el|περιφέρειες}})—nine on the mainland and four island groups—which are further subdivided into 74 [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] and 325 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]]. Formerly, there were also 54 [[Prefectures of Greece|prefectures]] or prefectural-level administrations.

The '''geology of Chile''' is a characterized by processes linked to [[subduction]] such as [[volcanism]], [[earthquake]]s and [[orogeny]]. The [[terrane|buildings blocks]] of Chile's geology [[accretion (geology)|assembled]] during the [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic Era]]. Chile was by then the southwestern margin of the supercontinent [[Gondwana]]. In the [[Jurassic]] Gondwana begun to split and the ongoing period of [[crustal deformation]] and [[mountain building]] known as the [[Andean orogeny]] begun. In the [[Cenozoic|Late Cenozoic]] Chile definitely separated from Antarctica, the Andes expienced a great rise accomplained by a cooling climate and the onset of [[glaciation]]s.  

The subduction interactions shaped four main [[morphostructure]]s of Chile: the [[Andes]]; the [[Chilean Central Valley|Intermediate Depression]], the [[Chilean Coast Range|Coast Range]], and the [[Peru–Chile Trench]] off the coast. Since Chile is on an active [[continental margin]], it has a large number of [[volcano]]es. Almost the entire country is subject to earthquakes arising from strains in the [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]] and [[Antarctic Plate]]s or shallow [[strike-slip fault]]s. Northern Chilean mineral resources are a major economic resources, and the country is the leading producer of [[copper]], [[lithium]] and [[molybdenum]]. Most of these mineral deposits were created from [[Magmatic water|magmatic]] [[Hydrothermal circulation|hydrothermal]] activity. The water required to form those deposits derived from the subducted slab of the oceanic crust beneath the Andes.

The Chilean [[Easter Island]] and [[Juan Fernández Archipelago]] are volcanic [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] islands in the eastward-moving Nazca plate. The geology of the [[Chilean Antarctic Territory]] has various commonalitiers with that of mainland Chile.

==General characteristics==
{{See also|Geography of Chile}}
The three primary morphological features derived from the Andes are the Andes Mountains proper, the Chilean Coast Range and the Chilean Central Valley, also known as the Intermediate Depression and the Longitudinal Valley. The mountains run parallel in a north-south direction from [[Morro de Arica]] to [[Taitao Peninsula]], making up most of Chile's land surface. South of Taitao, only the Andes Mountains are present.

North of the Taitao Peninsula, the Peru–Chile Trench [[subduction zone]] is the boundary between the South American and Nazca Plates. At Taitao, the [[Chile Triple Junction]] and the [[Nazca Plate]] subduct the South American Plate.

===The Andes===
[[File:Miscanti Lagoon near San Pedro de Atacama Chile Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Stark mountains in background, with salt flats in foreground|The Andes are generally higher in northern Chile.]]

In [[Norte Grande]] the mountains form a series of [[plateaus]], such as [[Puna de Atacama]] and the [[Altiplano]]. At a south latitude of 27 degrees, Chile's highest mountain ([[Ojos del Salado]]) reaches a height of {{convert|6893|m}}. Below 42 degrees south, the Andes split into a [[fjord]] landscape and the highest mountain is [[Monte San Lorenzo]] at {{convert|3706|m}}. As the mountains ebb, the [[snow line]] lowers; in the [[Llanquihue Lake|Llanquihue]] it is at {{convert|1200|m}}, and {{convert|900|m}} in the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes]].

===Intermediate Depression===
{{main|Chilean Central Valley}}

The Intermediate Depression, a series of faults running north to south, separates the Andes from the Coast Range with a steady decrease in altitude as the latitude increases. In [[Norte Grande]] the Intermediate Depression is partially covered by a series of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flat]]s, and has the world's largest [[potassium nitrate]] deposits. In [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], the depression disappears briefly before reappearing in a narrow valley at [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. From the narrows southward the valley widens until it is interrupted near [[Loncoche]] by the [[Bahía Mansa Metamorphic Complex]] (part of the Coast Range), then widening at [[Los Llanos, Chile|Los Llanos]] (near [[Paillaco]]). In central and southern Chile (33°-42° south), the landscape is partially covered with glacial [[sediments]] from the Andes. In [[Zona Austral]] (south of 42° south) the depression dips below [[sea level]], appearing occasionally in islands such as [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]]. Its southern end is the [[Isthmus of Ofqui]].

===Chilean Coast Range===
{{main|Chilean Coast Range}}

The [[Chilean Coast Range]] runs southward along the coast (parallel to the Andes) from [[Morro de Arica]] to [[Taitao Peninsula]], ending at the [[Chile Triple Junction]]. The range, a combined [[horst (geology)|horst]], [[Foreland basin|forearc high]] and [[accretionary wedge]], was separated from the Andes during the [[Tertiary]] rise due to the [[subsidence]] of the Intermediate Depression.

===Paleozoic Era===
The oldest rocks in Chile are [[mica]]ceous [[schist]]s, [[phyllite]]s, [[gneiss]]es and [[quartzite]]s, many examples of which are found in the [[Chilean Coast Range|Coast Range]] of south-central Chile. The schists of [[Zona Sur|southern Chile]] were initially formed by sediment in the proto-Pacific Ocean, and later metamorphosed in the [[forearc]] wedge of the Peru–Chile Trench.

===Mesozoic Era===
{{See also|Antarctic Floristic Kingdom}}

During the [[Triassic]] Period about 250 million years ago Chile was part of the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]], which concentrated the world's major land masses. [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Australia]] and [[India]] were near Chile. When Pangaea began to split apart during the [[Jurassic]] period, South America and the adjacent land masses formed [[Gondwana]]. Floral affinities among these now-distant landmasses date from the Gondwanaland period. South America separated from Antarctica and Australia 27 million years ago with the development of the [[Drake Passage]]. Across the {{convert|1000|km|adj=on}}-wide Drake Passage lie the mountains of the [[Antarctic Peninsula]], south of the Scotia Plate, which appear to be a continuation of the Andes. In the extreme south, the [[Magallanes–Fagnano Fault]] separates [[Tierra del Fuego]] from the small [[Scotia Plate]].

The formation of the Andes began during the Jurassic. During the [[Cretaceous]], the Andes began to assume their present form by the uplifting, [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] and [[Fold (geology)|folding]] of [[sedimentary rocks|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rocks]] of ancient [[craton]]s. Tectonic forces along the [[subduction zone]] along the west coast of South America continue to their [[Orogeny|orogenesis]], resulting in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions to this day.

===Cenozoic Era===
The [[Altiplano]] [[plateau]] was formed during the [[Tertiary]], with several mechanisms  proposed; all attempt to explain why the topography of the Andes incorporates a large area of low relief at high altitude (high plateau): 
# Existence of weaknesses in the Earth's crust prior to tectonic shortening. Such weaknesses would cause the partition of tectonic deformation and uplift into eastern and western cordillera, leaving the necessary space for the formation of the Altiplano basin.
# Magmatic processes rooted in the asthenosphere might have contributed to uplift the plateau.
# Climate controlled the spatial distribution of erosion and sediment deposition, creating the lubrication along the Nazca Plate subduction and hence influencing the transmission of tectonic forces into South America.
# Climate also determined the formation of internal drainage (endorheism) and sediment trapping within the Andes, potentially blocking tectonic deformation in the area between the two cordilleras.

====Quaternary====
The [[Quaternary]] [[glaciation]]s left visible marks in most parts of Chile, particularly  [[Zona Sur]] and [[Zona Austral]]. These include [[ice field]]s, [[fjord]]s, [[glacial lake]]s and u-shaped valleys. During the [[Santa María glaciation]] glaciers extended into the Pacific Ocean at 42° south, dividing the [[Chilean Coast Range]] and creating what is now [[Chacao Channel]]. [[Chiloé Island|Chiloé]], part of the Chilean Coast Range, became an island. South of Chacao Channel, Chile's coast is split by fjords, islands and channels; these glaciers created [[moraine]]s at the edges of the Patagonian lakes, changing their outlets to the Pacific and shifting the [[continental divide]]. The remnants of the [[Patagonian Ice Sheet]] which covered large parts of Chile and [[Argentina]] are the [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field|Northern]] and the [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]s.

It has been suggested that from 1675 to 1850 the [[San Rafael Glacier]] advanced during the [[Little Ice Age]]. The first documented visit to the area was made in 1675 by the Spanish explorer [[:es:Antonio de Vea|Antonio de Vea]], who entered [[San Rafael Lagoon]] through [[:es:Río Témpanos|Río Témpanos]] ("Ice Floe River") without mentioning the many [[Drift ice|ice floes]] for which the river is named. De Vea also wrote that the [[San Rafael Glacier]] did not reach far into the lagoon. In 1766 another expedition noticed that the glacier did reach the lagoon and had [[Ice calving|calved]] into [[icebergs]]. [[Hans Steffen]] visited the area in 1898, noting that the glacier now penetrated far into the lagoon. As of 2001, the glacier has retreated behind its 1675 border due to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hol.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/17/7/987|title=Historical records of San Rafael glacier advances (North Patagonian Icefield): another clue to 'Little Ice Age' timing in southern Chile?|journal=The Holocene|date=November 2007|volume=17|issue=7|pages=987–998|subscription=yes|doi= 10.1177/0959683607082414|accessdate=July 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific islands==
[[File:Moai Rano raraku.jpg|thumb|alt=Statues of heads on Easter Island|Most of the [[moai]] on Easter island are carved from [[volcanic]] [[tuff]].]]

[[Easter Island]] is a volcanic [[high island]] consisting of three extinct volcanoes: [[Terevaka]], at an altitude of {{convert|507|m}}, forms the bulk of the island. Two other volcanoes ([[Poike]] and [[Rano Kau]]) form the eastern and southern headlands, giving the island its triangular shape. There are numerous lesser cones and other volcanic features: the crater [[Rano Raraku]], the [[cinder cone]] [[Puna Pau]] and many volcanic caves (including [[lava tubes]]).
 
Easter Island and its surrounding islets, including [[Motu Nui]] and [[Motu Iti (Rapa Nui)|Motu Iti]], form the comminuted apex of a large volcanic mountain rising over {{convert|2000|m}} from the seabed. It is part of the Sala y Gómez Ridge, a mostly-submarine mountain range with dozens of [[seamount]]s. [[Pukao (Seamount)|Pukao]] and [[Moai (seamount)|Moai]] are two seamounts west of Easter Island, extending {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} east to the [[Nazca Seamount]]. Pukao, Moai and Easter Island were formed during the last 750,000 years, with the last eruption a little over 100,000 years ago. These are the youngest mountains of the Sala y Gómez Ridge, which was formed by the [[Nazca Plate]] floating over the [[Easter hotspot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/petroj/online/Volume_38/Issue_06/html/ega038_gml.html#hd15 The Petrogenetic Evolution of Lavas from Easter Island and Neighbouring Seamounts, Near-ridge Hotspot Volcanoes in theSE Pacific&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Only on Easter Island is the Sala y Gómez Ridge dry land.

The [[volcano|volcanic]] [[Juan Fernández Islands]] were created by a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] in the Earth's mantle penetrating the [[Nazca Plate]]. The islands were carried eastward as the plate subducted the [[South America]]n continent. [[Radiometric dating]] indicates that Santa Clara is the oldest of the islands (at 5.8&amp;nbsp;million years), followed by Robinson Crusoe (3.8–4.2&amp;nbsp;million years) and Alexander Selkirk (1.0–2.4&amp;nbsp;million years). Robinson Crusoe is the largest of the islands at {{convert|93|km2|sqmi}}, and its highest peak (El Yunque) is {{convert|916|m}} high. Alexander Selkirk covers {{convert|50|km2|sqmi}}, and its highest peak is Los Innocentes at {{convert|1319|m}}. Santa Clara covers {{convert|2.2|km2|acre}}, reaching an elevation of {{convert|350|m}}.

===Mining===
{{see also|Mining in Chile}}
[[File:Chuqui001 02.jpg|thumb|alt=Truck on road of open-pit mine|[[Chuquicamata]] copper mine in 1984]]

Chile has the world's largest [[copper]] reserves, and is the largest producer and exporter of the metal.&lt;ref name=minas&gt;U.S. Geological Survey (2005). [http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2005/cimyb05.pdf Minerals Yearbook 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt; Notable copper mines include [[Chuquicamata]] and [[Escondida]]. Chile accounts for five percent of the Western Hemisphere's [[gold]] production, of which 41 percent is a by-product of [[copper extraction]].&lt;ref name=minas/&gt; The country holds the largest world reserves of [[rhenium]]&lt;ref name=minas/&gt;  and [[potassium nitrate]], and its reserves of [[molybdenum]] are estimated to be the third-largest in the world.&lt;ref name=minas/&gt; Most of Chile’s mineral resources are in [[Norte Grande, Chile|the north]]; [[gas]], [[coal]] and [[oil]] reserves, in the southern [[Magallanes Region]], are sufficient for local needs. [[Guarello Island]], in the Magallanes Region, has the world's southernmost [[limestone]] mine.

===Geothermal energy===
{{main|Geothermal power in Chile}}

Since 2000, geothermal exploration and concessions have been regulated by the [[Law of Geothermal Concessions]] ({{lang-es|Ley de Concesiones de Energía Geotérmica}}). The Chilean company Geotermia del Pacífico, with support from [[CORFO]], is exploring a location in [[Curacautín]] as a site for a [[geothermal power plant]]. Geotermia del Paícifco's studies indicated that two geothermal fields near Curacautín could be used for energy production, with a combined capacity to supply 36,000 homes in 2010. One area to be developed is located near the [[Tolhuaca]] hot springs, and the other is in Río Blanco Springs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santiagotimes.cl/santiagotimes/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=10812 "Chile Could Have Geothermal Energy By 2010"]. ''Santiago Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Another area under consideration for geothermal production is [[Cordón Caulle]].

===Tourism===
Although geology-focused tourism is rare, there are some sites in which the local geology is a major attraction (for example, the copper mine at [[Chuquicamata]]).

==Geological hazards==

{{Color box|pink|border=darkgray}} Area of the city most affected by earthquake&lt;br&gt;
{{Color box|red|border=darkgray}} City blocks most damaged by fire ]]
[[Earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s and [[Mass wasting|mass ground movements]] are frequent occurrences. The subduction zone along Chile's coast has produced the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, the [[1960 Valdivia earthquake]]. Earthquakes are notorious for triggering volcanic eruptions, such as the [[1960 Cordón Caulle eruption]]. Chilean earthquakes have produced tsunamis.

Landslides occur frequently in the Andes, most following earthquakes. The [[2007 Aysén Fjord earthquakes]] produced several landslides along the Fjords Mountains, spawning a tsunami. [[Lahar]]s are among the most lethal volcanic hazards in Chile; a lahar destroyed the original site of [[Coñaripe]].

==={{anchor|Background}}Earthquakes===
{{main|List of earthquakes in Chile}}

Major earthquakes in Chile occur in a small number of source areas. Those affecting coastal regions are generally aligned offshore from Concepción southward, with the major epicenters producing a predictable pattern of seismic and tsunami effects.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cinna Lomnitz|Lomnitz, Cinna]]; [http://www.springerlink.com/content/px09777871518022/  "Major earthquakes and tsunamis in Chile during the period 1535 to 1955"]; ''[[International Journal of Earth Sciences]]'', Vol. 59, No. 3; abstract.&lt;/ref&gt; The first systematic seismological recordings in Chile began after an earthquake and fire devastated Valparaiso in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Moreno, Teresa. (2006). {{Google books|h4DBQR9jDsoC|''The Geology of Chile,'' p. 264.|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquakes in northern Chile are known to have caused both [[tectonic uplift|uplift]] and [[subsidence]] of the continent. Large earthquakes of [[moment magnitude|Magnitude]] 8 or more are associated with subsidence and drowning of the Chilean coast, except peninsulas and offshore islands. Magnitude 7 to 8 earthquakes with a source area near an internal boundary of the Earth known as the [[Mohorovičić discontinuity|Moho]] are known to result in uplift of the coast. Earthquakes near the Moho may account for permanent [[deformation (geology)|deformation]] of the western edge of [[South American plate]] that accumulates into a long-term net uplift of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Melnick |first1=Daniel |date=2016 |title=Rise of the central Andean coast by earthquakes straddling the Moho |url= |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=9 |issue=5 |pages=401–408 |doi=10.1038/NGEO2683 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Time-span|Conclusions}}Quake clusters===
Although the most powerful six quakes recorded were clustered in two time periods (a 12-year span from 1952 to 1964 and a seven-year span from 2004 to 2011), this is considered a statistical anomaly.&lt;ref name="pappas"&gt;Pappas, Stephanie.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6939">[[File:Bedrock map Earth2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Example of a global relief model: Earth2014 bedrock layer (topography over land, bathymetry over oceans and major lakes, sub-ice-topography over ice-shields)]]
[[File:Earth_dry_elevation.stl|thumb|[[STL (file format)|STL 3D model]] of Earth without liquid water but with ice, with 20&amp;times; elevation exaggeration]]
A '''global relief model''', sometimes also denoted as '''global [[topography]] model'' or composite model, combines [[digital elevation model]] (DEM) data over land with digital [[bathymetry]] model (DBM) data over water-covered areas (oceans, lakes) to describe Earth’s relief. A relief model thus shows how Earth’s surface would look like in the absence of water or ice masses.

The relief is represented by a set of heights (elevations or depths) that refer to some height reference surface, often the [[mean sea level]] or the [[geoid]]. Global relief models are used for a variety of applications including [[geovisualization]], [[Geology|geologic]], [[Geomorphology|geomorphologic]] and [[Geophysics|geophysical]] analyses, [[gravity field]] modelling as well as geo-statistics.

==Measurement==
Global relief models are always based on combinations of data sets from different [[remote sensing]] techniques. This is because there is no single remote sensing technique that would allow measurement of the relief both over dry and water-covered areas.  Elevation data over land is often obtained from [[LIDAR]] or [[inSAR]] measurements, while [[bathymetry]] is acquired based on [[SONAR]] and altimetry. Global relief models may also contain elevations of the bedrock (sub-ice-topography) below the ice shields of [[Greenland]] and [[Antarctica]]. Ice sheet thickness, mostly measured through ice-penetrating [[RADAR]], is subtracted from the ice surface heights to reveal the bedrock.

==Spatial resolution==
While digital elevation models describe Earth’s land topography often with 1 to 3 arc-second resolution (e.g., from the [[SRTM]] or [[Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer|ASTER]] missions), the global bathymetry (e.g., SRTM30_PLUS) is known to a much lesser spatial resolution in the kilometre-range. The same holds true for models of the bedrock of Antarctica and Greenland.  Therefore, global relief models are often constructed at 1&amp;nbsp;arc-minute resolution (corresponding to about 1.8&amp;nbsp;km postings). Some products such as the 30 and 15 arc-second resolution SRTM30_PLUS/ SRTM15_PLUS grids offer higher resolution to adequately represent SONAR depth measurements where available.

==Public data sets==
Data sets produced and released to the public include Earth2014, SRTM30_PLUS and ETOPO1.

===Earth2014 (2015)===
[[File:Earth2014 visualisation Antarctica.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Four different topography layers of the Earth2014 model. Clockwise from top left: (1) Earth's surface, (2) bedrock, (3) rock-equivalent topography, (4) bathymetry and ice surface]]
The most recent global relief model is Earth2014,&lt;ref name=HirtRexer2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hirt|first1=C.|last2=Rexer|first2=M.|title=Earth2014: 1 arc-min shape, topography, bedrock and ice-sheet models - available as gridded data and degree-10,800 spherical harmonics|journal=International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation|volume=39|pages=103–112|url=http://ddfe.curtin.edu.au/models/Earth2014/Hirt_Rexer2015_Earth2014.pdf|accessdate=February 20, 2016|doi=10.1016/j.jag.2015.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed at Curtin University (Western Australia) and TU Munich (Germany). Earth2014 provides sets of 1 arc-min resolution global grids of Earth's relief in different representations based on the 2013 releases of bedrock and ice-sheet data over Antarctica (Bedmap2) and Greenland (Greenland Bedrock Topography), the 2013 SRTM_30PLUS bathymetry and 2008 SRTM V4.1 SRTM land topography.

Earth2014 provides five different layers of height data, including Earth’s surface (lower interface of the atmosphere), topography and bathymetry of the oceans and major lakes, topography, bathymetry and bedrock, ice-sheet thicknesses and rock-equivalent topography.  The Earth2014 global grids are provided as heights relative to the [[mean sea level]], and as planetary radii relative to the centre of Earth, which show the shape of the Earth.

===SRTM30_PLUS (2014)===
SRTM30_PLUS&lt;ref name=Sandwell2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sandwell|first1=D.|title=New global marine gravity model from CryoSat-2 and Jason-1 reveals buried tectonic structure|journal=Science|volume=346|issue=6205|pages=65–67|doi=10.1126/science.1258213|display-authors=etal|pmid=25278606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 20, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is a combined bathymetry and topography model produced by [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] (California). The version 15_PLUS comes at 0.25 arc-min resolution (about 450 m postings), while the 30_PLUS version offers 0.5 arc-min (900 m) resolution. The bathymetric data in SRTM30_PLUS stems from depth soundings (SONAR) and from satellite altimetry. The bathymetric component of SRTM30_PLUS gets regularly updated with new or improved data sets in order to continuously improve and refine the description of the sea floor geometry. Over land areas, SRTM30 data from the USGS is included. SRTM30_PLUS provides background information for [[Google Earth]] and [[Google Maps]].

===ETOPO1 (2009)===
The ETOPO1&lt;ref name=AmanteEakins2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amante|first1=C.|last2=Eakins|first2=B.W.|title=ETOPO1 1 Arc-Minute Global Relief Model: Procedures, Data Sources and Analysis|journal=NOAA Technical Memorandum NESDIS NGDC-24|doi=10.7289/V5C8276M}}&lt;!--|accessdate=February 20, 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 1-arcmin global relief model, produced by the [[National Geophysical Data Center]] (Colorado), provides two layers of relief information. One layer represents the global relief including bedrock over Antarctica and Greenland, and another layer the global relief including ice surface heights. Both layers include [[bathymetry]] over the oceans and some of Earth’s major lakes. ETOPO1 land topography and ocean bathymetry relies on SRTM30 topography and a multitude of bathymetric surveys that have been merged.  Historic versions of ETOPO1 are the ETOPO2 and ETOPO5 relief models (2 and 5 arc-min resolution).

The ETOPO1 global relief model is based on the 2001 Bedmap1 model of bedrock over Antarctica, which is now superseded by the significantly improved Bedmap2 bedrock data. The ETOPO1-contained information on ocean depths is superseded through several updates of the SRTM30_PLUS bathymetry.

It is housed by the Rare Book Division of the New York Public Library.

It is notable as one of only two known instances of a historical map actually using the phrase ''HC SVNT DRACONES'' (in Latin ''hic sunt dracones'' means "[[here be dragons|here are dragons]]".)

== Description ==

The Lenox Globe is a hollow copper globe that measures {{convert|112|mm|in}} in diameter and {{convert|345|mm|in}} in circumference. It is two parts, joined at the equator and held together by a wire strung through holes at the poles.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Bulletin of the New York Public Library | publisher = New York Public Library | location = New York | date = January 1904 | pages = 415 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zBEDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA415 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It bears a striking resemblance to the [[Globus Jagellonicus]], also tentatively dated to 1510.

The phrase ''HIC SVNT DRACONES'' appears on the eastern coast of [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="NYPL Treasures" /&gt;

== Background ==

The globe's origins were unknown until 2013. It was purchased in [[Paris]] in 1855 by architect [[Richard Morris Hunt]], who gave it to [[James Lenox]], whose collection became part of the [[New York Public Library]], where the globe still resides.

In his recollections, [[Henry Stevens (bibliographer)|Henry Stevens]] recalled seeing the globe while dining with Mr. Hunt in 1870. Hunt was ambivalent about the globe, which he bought "for a song", and was allowing his children to toy with it. Stevens recognized its value and urged Hunt to store it in the [[Lenox Library (New York)|Lenox Library]], which he was designing at the time. Stevens also borrowed the globe to ascertain its age with the help of [[Julius Erasmus Hilgard]], who worked for the Coast Survey—a predecessor to the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | last = Stevens | first = Henry | title = Recollections of Mr. James Lenox of New York, &amp; the Formation of His Library | publisher = Henry Stevens &amp; Son | location = Vermont | year = 1886 | pages = 140–143 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8_QCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar [[grapefruit]]-sized globe made from two halves of an [[Ostrich#Reproduction|ostrich egg]] was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the [[New World]]. Stefaan Missinne,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Missinne | first = Stefaan | date = Fall 2013 | title = A Newly Discovered Early Sixteenth-Century Globe Engraved on an Ostrich Egg:  The Earliest Surviving Globe Showing the New World. | journal = The Portolan, journal of the Washington Map Society | issue = 87 | pages = 8–24 | url = http://www.washmapsociety.org/The-Portolan-Journal.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal ''Portolan'', said it was "part of an important European collection for decades."&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;{{cite news|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-19/national/41424018_1_egg-two-globes-copper|title=Oldest globe to depict the New World may have been discovered|last=Kim|first=Meeri|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=2013-08-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209014054/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-08-19/national/41424018_1_egg-two-globes-copper|archivedate=2013-12-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt–Lenox Globe was a [[copper]] [[Die casting|cast]] of the egg globe.&lt;ref name=Kim/&gt;

The earliest known article on the globe was written by B. F. de Costa for the ''Magazine of American History'' in September 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | last = De Costa | first = B.F. | date = September 1879 | title = The Lenox Globe | journal = The Magazine of American History | publisher = A.

Barnes | location = New York | volume = 3 | issue = 9 | pages = 12 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iCIDAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Gravier reprinted the article with additional comments in the ''Bulletin de la société normande de géographie'' later that year.&lt;ref&gt;"Le Globe Lenox", ''Bulletin de la société normande de géographie'' (Oct–Dec. 1879), pp. 216–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, neither article links ''hic sunt dracones'' to dragons. Da Costa writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In this region [China, called "East India" on the globe], near the equatorial line, is seen "Hc Svnt Dracones", or here are the Dagroians, described by [[Marco Polo]] as living in the Kingdom of "Dagroian". These people... feasted upon the dead and picked their bones (B.II. c.14, [[Giovanni Battista Ramusio|Ramusio]]'s ed.)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his translation of Da Costa's article, Gabriel Gravier adds that Marco Polo's Kingdom of Dagroian is in Java Minor, or [[Sumatra]], well away from the spot indicated on the Lenox Globe.

The flat drawing of the globe which accompanied the early articles is reproduced as map 7 in Emerson D. Fite and Archibald Freeman's ''A Book of Old Maps Delineating American History'' (New York: Dover Reprints, 1969), and as figure 43 in [[A. E. Nordenskiöld]]'s ''Facsimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography'' (New York: Dover Reprints, 1973).

A photograph of the globe itself can be found on page 81 of Ena L. Yonge's ''A Catalogue of Early Globes Made Prior to 1850 and Conserved in the United States'' (New York: American Geographical Society, 1968); however, the side with the inscription faces away from the camera.

The '''Indian subcontinent''' is a southern [[region]] and [[peninsula]] of [[Asia]], mostly situated on the [[Indian Plate]] and projecting southwards into the [[Indian Ocean]] from the [[Himalayas]]. [[Geology|Geologically]], the Indian subcontinent is related to the land mass that rifted from [[Gondwana]] and merged with the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian plate]] nearly 55 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; [[Geography|Geographically]], it is the [[peninsula]]r region in south-central Asia delineated by the [[Himalayas]] in the north, the [[Hindu Kush]] in the west, and the [[Arakan Mountains|Arakanese]] in the east.&lt;ref name="Chapman, Graham P. p. 10"/&gt; Politically, the Indian subcontinent includes [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;"Indian subcontinent". ''[[Oxford Dictionary of English|New Oxford Dictionary of English]]'' ({{ISBN|0-19-860441-6}}) New York: Oxford University Press, 2001; p. 929: "the part of Asia south of the Himalayas which forms a peninsula extending into the Indian Ocean, between the [[Arabian Sea]] and the [[Bay of Bengal]].

Sometimes, the geographical term 'Indian subcontinent' is used interchangeably with '[[South Asia]]',&lt;ref name=mcleodplus/&gt; although that last term is used typically as a political term and is also used to include [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;As for example it is in the [[South Asian Games]] and the 8-nation [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), an economic cooperation organisation in the region, established in 1985, and ; {{cite web|last=SAARC Summit|title=SAARC|url=http://www.saarc-sec.org/|publisher=SAARC Summit|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Which countries should be included in either of these remains the subject of debate.&lt;ref name=anderson5&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ewan W.

== Name==

According to ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', the term "subcontinent" signifies a "subdivision of a continent which has a distinct geographical, political, or cultural identity" and also a "large land mass somewhat smaller than a continent". It is first attested in 1845 to refer to the [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]s, before they were regarded as separate continents. Its use to refer to the Indian subcontinent is seen from the early twentieth century. It was especially convenient for referring to the region comprising both [[British India]] and the [[princely state]]s under [[British Paramountcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=subcontinent|id=192528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|term=Indian subcontinent|id=94389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Indian subcontinent also has a geological significance. Similar to various continents, it was a part of the supercontinent of [[Gondwana]]. A series of tectonic splits caused formation of various basins, each drifting in various directions. The geological region called "Greater India" once included [[Madagascar]], [[Seychelles]], [[Antarctica]] and Austrolasia along with the Indian subcontinent basin. As a geological term, Indian subcontinent has meant that region formed from the collision of the Indian basin with Eurasia nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of [[Paleocene]].&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Wynn Jones|title=Applications of Palaeontology: Techniques and Case Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mrPiq_8pkAwC&amp;pg=PA267 |year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-49920-0|pages=267–271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hinsbergen | first=D.

The Indian subcontinent has been a term particularly common in the British Empire.&lt;ref name=mcleodplus&gt;John McLeod, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y8Y3MH3dj6MC&amp;pg=PA1 The history of India]'', page 1, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, {{ISBN|0-313-31459-4}}; note: McLeod does not include Afghanistan in Indian subcontinent or South Asia;&lt;br&gt;Jim Norwine &amp; Alfonso González, ''The Third World: states of mind and being'', pages 209, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1988, {{ISBN|0-04-910121-8}}&lt;br&gt;Raj S. Bhopal, ''Ethnicity, race, and health in multicultural societies'', pages 33, Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-19-856817-7}}; Quote: "The term South Asian refers to populations originating from the Indian subcontinent, effectively India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka;&lt;br&gt;Lucian W. Pye &amp; Mary W. Pye, ''Asian Power and Politics'', pages 133, Harvard University Press, 1985, {{ISBN|0-674-04979-9}}&lt;br&gt;Mark Juergensmeyer, ''The Oxford handbook of global religions'', pages 465, Oxford University Press US, 2006, {{ISBN|0-19-513798-1}}&lt;br&gt;Sugata Bose &amp; Ayesha Jalal, ''Modern South Asia'', pages 3, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-30787-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!-- not one of these sources is from the "British Empire", and none of them talk about the British Empire. The earliest use of the term I could find is from 1915, and it is American, not British--&gt;

The geographical region has historically simply been known as "India" (in antiquity referring to the [[Indus Valley]] region, not the entire subcontinent).  Other related terms are [[Greater India]] and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name=mittal&gt;Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby, ''Religions of South Asia: An Introduction'', page 3, Routledge, 2006, {{ISBN|9781134593224}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kathleen M page 10"&gt;Kathleen M. Baker and Graham P. Chapman, ''The Changing Geography of Asia'', page 10, Routledge, 2002, {{ISBN|9781134933846}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
And the terms "Indian subcontinent" and "South Asia" are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref name=mcleodplus/&gt; There is no globally accepted definition on which countries are a part of South Asia or the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=anderson5/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jona Razzaque 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name=mmann&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia’s Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uh0cBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13|year=2014|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-317-62445-5|pages=13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The less common term "South Asian subcontinent" has seen occasional use since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Official Records: Proces-verbaux Officiels. Supplement. Supplement  1624-1683, United Nations, 1972, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology===
Geologically, the Indian subcontinent was first a part of so-called "Greater India",&lt;ref name=hinsbergen1/&gt; a region of [[Gondwana]] that drifted away from [[East Africa]] about 160 million years ago, around the Middle Jurassic period.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The region experienced high volcanic activity and plate subdivisions, creating Madagascar, Seychelles, Antarctica, Austrolasia and the Indian subcontinent basin. The Indian subcontinent drifted northeastwards, colliding with the Eurasian plate nearly 55 million years ago, towards the end of Paleocene. This geological region largely includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name="Jones2011p267"/&gt; The zone where the Eurasian and Indian subcontinent plates meet remains one of the geologically active areas, prone to major earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bethany D.

The neotectonic units of Asia are Stable Asia, the Arabian and Indian cratons, the Alpide plate boundary zone (along which the Arabian and Indian platforms have collided with the Eurasian continental plate), and the island arcs and marginal basins."&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the more expansive definition – counting India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and Maldives as the constituent countries – the Indian subcontinent covers about 4.4 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (1.7 million sq&amp;nbsp;mi), which is 10% of the Asian continent or 3.3% of the world's land surface area.&lt;ref name=JJCO&gt;Desai, Praful B. 2002.

The Indian subcontinent is a natural physical landmass in South Asia, geologically the dry-land portion of the [[Indian Plate]], which  has been relatively isolated from the rest of Eurasia.&lt;ref name="AsherTalbot2006"/&gt; 
Given the difficulty of passage through the Himalayas, the sociocultural, religious and political interaction of the Indian subcontinent has largely been through the valleys of Afghanistan in its northwest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John L.

'''The International SeaKeepers Society''' was founded in 1998 by a small group of yacht owners who were alarmed by the deterioration of our natural environment.  The organization’s initial focus was on the development and use of instrumentation on yachts to monitor marine conditions throughout the world’s oceans. Today, The International SeaKeepers Society continues to work with yachts as a vital part of its programming. The International SeaKeepers Society is a 501 (c) 3 organization of opinion leaders, scientists, businessmen and environmental advocates who have the passion and capabilities to impact ocean research, conservation and policy decisions. Working with governments, educational institutions, private foundations and non-profit organizations provides SeaKeepers and its members the opportunity to fulfill its mission. SeaKeepers long-established relationship with the yachting community creates an optimal platform to support oceanographic research while simultaneously engaging and educating yacht owners and professionals and the general public.

In 2014, The International SeaKeepers Society received the Fabien Cousteau Blue Award, an award given out by the International Superyacht Society to honor stewardship of the marine environment.

In 2011, the International SeaKeepers Society was featured by ''Mega Yacht News'' as one of six ocean-oriented charities to support within the yachting community.&lt;ref name=MYN&gt;{{cite news|last=Bryne|first=Diane M.|title=The Superyacht 6: 6 Ocean-Oriented Charities to Support|url=http://megayachtnews.com/2011/02/the-superyacht-6-6-ocean-oriented-charities-to-support/#axzz28LJvEgxY |accessdate=30 November 2012|newspaper=Mega Yacht News|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission and Vision==

The International SeaKeepers Society promotes oceanographic research, conservation and education through direct involvement with the yachting community. SeaKeepers enables the yachting community to take full advantage of their unique potential to advance marine sciences and to raise awareness about global ocean issues.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

==History==
Founding members of the International SeaKeepers Society include [[Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr.|Alexander Dreyfoos]], Alfred H. Balm, [[Richard DeVos]], [[Jim Moran (automotive)|Jan Moran]] and Bruce McCaw. These Founding Members wanted to raise awareness regarding critical ocean issues and encourage ocean preservation.  Their mission was to construct a monitoring unit that would provide data to scientists about the conditions of the seas. The resulting unit was called the SeaKeeper 1000. The SeaKeeper 1000 was deployed on more than 90 platforms across the globe including yachts, cruise ships, buoys, and piers. While the SeaKeeper 1000 was active, the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and the U.S. [[National Weather Service]] utilized the SeaKeeper 1000 on many of their NOAA vessels to better monitor oceanographic changes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marinefuel.com/international-seakeepers-society/ "International Seakeepers Society"] Marine Fuel Company. August 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The International SeaKeepers Society discontinued the SeaKeeper 1000 in October 2013.

===SeaKeeper 1000===
The ''SeaKeeper 1000'' unit was designed to record weather and near surface oceanographic data automatically. It then transmitted the data via NOAA satellites and through the [[Global Telecommunication System]] (GTS).
The SeaKeeper 1000 unit won the ''2002 Environment Award'' from [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]].&lt;ref name=TECH&gt;[http://thetechawards.thetech.org/laureate/archive/2002 "2002 Environment Award Laureate"] The Tech Awards&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yacht-transport.com/page/seakeeperssociety.html "Dockwise Yacht Transport Supports the International SeaKeepers Society"] Dockwise Yacht Transport&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002, 61 society members and 4 cruise lines had installed SeaKeeper 1000, and 14 yacht manufacturers had agreed to include the technology on their boats/ships.&lt;ref name=TECH /&gt;

===BP oil spill===
In response to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]], the Society with the assistance of researchers at the [[University of South Florida]] and environmental sensor company YSI were able to attach and interface a hydrocarbon sensor to the SeaKeeper 1000 environmental monitor in June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Diane M.: [http://megayachtnews.com/2010/07/international-seakeepers-society-hydrocarbon-sensors-bp-oil-spill/#axzz28LJvEgxY "International SeaKeepers Society Responding to BP Spill"] MegaYacht News, July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; SeaKeepers continues to focus on oil spill prevention and works with organizations like CARTHE, Consortium for Advanced Research on the Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment,  is a research team dedicated to predicting the fate of oil released into our environment to help inform and guide response teams, thereby protecting and minimizing damage to human health, the economy, and the environment with this research team dedicated to predicting the fate of oil released into the environment.

==Programs and Policies==

===DISCOVERY Yachts Program===
The DISCOVERY Yachts Program is SeaKeepers foremost initiative in accomplishing its mission and goals. The program is composed of scientific expeditions, instrument deployments and educational outreach events. SeaKeepers collaborates with numerous organizations, academic institutions and government agencies in order to accomplish its DISCOVERY Yacht missions. SeaKeepers staff work closely with yacht owners and crew to coordinate research and outreach activities that reflect the yacht owner’s ocean-related interests. Vessel owners who generously donate time on their yachts to the SeaKeepers DISCOVERY Yachts Program may qualify for tax benefits to the extent of the law.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

===Scientific Expeditions===
Scientific expeditions provide yacht owners, guests and crew the opportunity to participate in ongoing research while engaging with influential, well-known marine scientists. The largest expense, and often limiting factor, in ocean research is access to an at-sea research platform. Using member yachts, SeaKeepers works with experts in the marine science and oceanography fields to promote and facilitate groundbreaking research. Each scientific expedition is unique, and is organized with both the science and yacht in mind. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Hydrophone Retrieval, May 2015 in Bimini, Bahamas: The International SeaKeepers Society SeaKeepers partnered with the University of Miami's RJ Dunlap team onboard D/Y Fugitive to retrieve and redeploy hydrophones used for continuous Tiger Shark research in the Bahamas.

Morphology Research, April 2015 in Bimini, Bahamas:Onboard D/Y Reel Buzz, The International SeaKeepers Society and The Billfish Foundation have taken the first steps in a joint effort to develop new methods for determining billfish health in collaboration with Dr. Duncan Irschick, a functional and evolutionary morphologist from the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Drifter Design Experiment, April 2015 in Miami, FL:The International SeaKeepers Society conducted a three-day expedition testing drifter designs and calibration calibration research onboard D/Y Shredder, which was generously provided to us by Fleet Miami. During the expedition SeaKeepers worked with researchers from the Consortium for Advanced Research on the Transport of Hydrocarbon in the Environment (CARTHE), the University of Miami and Florida State University.

Tiger Shark Tagging, November 2014 in Tiger Beach, Bahamas:The International SeaKeepers Society teamed up with the UM Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, Marine Conservation Program, Florida Biodiversity Institute, and National Geographic to conduct another tiger shark tagging expedition. The shark tagging took place at Tiger Beach, Bahamas onboard DISCOVERY Yachts Fugitive, out of West Palm Beach, FL, and Qing, out of Fort Lauderdale, FL. Fugitive is a 125-foot Northcoast and Qing is a 150-foot Cheoy Lee.

Harbor Porpoises, October 2014 in San Francisco, California: The Golden Gate Cetacean Research (GGCR) team, along with SeaKeepers staff and the owner of E Cruz, successfully studied the behavior and population of harbor porpoises in San Francisco Bay through photo identification. A preliminary calculation shows 88 porpoises were counted, over twice as many as GGCR has ever seen from a boat in San Francisco Bay, and half a dozen cetaceans were added to GGCR’s ID catalog.The results of the survey will allow GGCR to correlate porpoise distribution with oceanographic characteristics to designate critical habitat locations.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Tiger Shark Tagging, May 2014 in Tiger Beach, Bahamas: The International SeaKeepers Society and a team of researchers from the University of Miami tagged tiger sharks, took blood samples,and conducted ultra-sounds using a custom-made floating platform designed by Florida Biodiversity Institute and Dr. Neil Hammerschlag. The floating platform was attached to the stern of the 138foot long Tri-Deck motor yacht, Penny Mae, which served as the base for the expedition site and research.

Genome Sequencing, January 2014 in Bimini, Bahamas and Florida Keys, Florida: State of the art mobile biomedical laboratory created by Florida Biodiversity Institute onboard Copasetic revolutionizes fieldwork and facilitates real-time, remote genome scale sequencing in pioneering week-long research expedition. Over the course of one week, top scientists from the University of Florida (UF) successfully sequenced two genomes per day, proving that modern technology and instrumentation traditionally found in top biomedical centers can function accurately in the field.

===Instrument Deployments===
SeaKeepers works with a number of institutions, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and Argo, to make ongoing oceanographic measurements. The collection of consistent and accurate data is extremely important for oil spill and [[marine debris]] accumulation analyses; weather and hurricane prediction models; quality control tests on satellites; and an overall better understanding of the marine environment. It is vital that the global instrument arrays are well distributed; private vessels achieve this along routes which are not typically travelled. Currently SeaKeepers employs the use of two types of devices: SeaKeepers Drifters and Argo Floats

The SeaKeepers Drifter is an environmental monitoring device that sits on the ocean surface and extends 15 meters deep into the water column. As the drifter floats along local and global currents, the instrument measures sea surface temperature, current velocity, latitude and longitude, and time. This data is transmitted directly to NOAA and WMO databases and made publicly available.

Argo Floats are technologically advanced water monitoring devices that are programmed to move up and down through the water column while traveling with the ocean currents. These floats sink down to 2000 meters and then rise to the surface, recording salinity, temperature, current velocity, and pressure/depth profiles. Data is sent directly to the Argo database and is made publicly available at www.argo.ucsd.edu. Having this type of data is vital to studying heat transport, ocean-atmosphere relationships, and climate variability. The lifespan of these floats is 5 years or more.

===Outreach Programs===
SeaKeepers outreach events have focused around marine wildlife, drifter deployments, [[plastic pollution]], sustainability practices and more.  SeaKeepers staff works closely with the yacht owner to determine what type of outreach and with what group will be most appropriate.

Youth Making Ripples Outreach Program: In April, 2015 The International SeaKeepers Society hosted an education outreach program with Youth Making Ripples Film Festival award-winners, researchers, and film makers onboard DISCOVERY Yacht Defiance.

Boys &amp; Girls of Newport Outreach Program: On August 12, 2014 The International SeaKeepers Society traveled to Newport, Rhode Island to conduct an education outreach program with a group of children from the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Newport County onboard DISCOVERY Yacht Defiance.

Louise McDonald High School Outreach Program: In January 2014 DISCOVERY Yacht M/Y Defiance invited 20+ Bahamian school children onboard her yacht to participate in an exciting and eventful day of ocean exploration and marine science education. The day was topped off with the successful launch of a SeaKeepers Drifter off the coast of the Bahamas. Several students assisted in the actual deployment of the drifter into the water along with Claudia Potamkin, SeaKeepers President &amp; CEO Richard Snow and Director of Programs and Policies Brittany Stockman.

==Partnerships==
On March 26, 2010 SeaKeepers formed an alliance with ''Yachts International'' Magazine to expand the Society's mission and to expand science-based understanding and analysis of global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seakeepers.org/Portals/0/Documents/PRESS%20RELEASE/ALLIANCE%20WITH%20YACHTS%20INTERNATIONAL%20MAGAZINE.pdf "SeaKeepers Forms Alliance with Yachts International"] Press Release. March 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

SeaKeepers works with yachting groups, including Fleet Miami, Global Oceans and EYOS Expeditions as well as research organizations including [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]], Argo, CARTHE, [[University of Miami]], [[University of Florida]] and Florida Biodiversity Institute.

SeaKeepers also works with local, national and international magazines and news outlets including, South Florida Luxury Guide Magazine, Venü Magazine, The Triton Newspaper and MegaYachtNews.com.

In 2012, SeaKeepers partnered with the Volvo Ocean Race.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Diane M. [http://megayachtnews.com/2012/03/international-seakeepers-society-volvo-ocean-race-vessels-of-opportunity/#axzz28LJvEgxY "Seeking Superyachts of Opportunity"] Mega Yacht News. March 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

SeaKeepers hosts variety of exclusive events throughout the year and in various locations around the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1309">An '''intertidal wetland''' is an area along a shoreline that is exposed to [[air]] at [[low tide]] and submerged at [[high tide]]. This type of [[wetland]] is defined by an [[intertidal zone]] and includes its own [[intertidal ecosystem]]s.

==Description==
The main types of intertidal wetlands are [[mudflat]]s (e.g., [[mangrove swamp]]s) and [[salt marsh]]es. The mangrove swamps are encountered along [[tropical]] shores and are characterized by [[tree]] vegetation, while  salt marshes are mostly found in [[temperate]] zones and are mostly [[grass]] ecosystems.&lt;ref name=dya/&gt;

Intertidal wetlands are commonly encountered in most [[estuaries]]. Intertidal wetland [[ecosystem]]s are amongst the most productive plant communities and often constitute a large part of the estuary areas.&lt;ref name=dya&gt;''Estuarine Ecology'', by John W. Day, Alejandro Yáñez-Arancibia, Chapter 5: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pn1x9wk-u1sC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22intertidal+wetlands%22 Intertidal Wetlands: Salt Marshes and Mangrove Swamps]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anville - Troisieme partie de la carte d'Asie.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville: ''Troisième partie de la carte d'Asie, contenant la Sibérie, et quelques autres parties de la Tartarie'', Paris (1753)]]
'''Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ batist buʁgiɲɔ̃ dɑ̃vil}}; born in [[Paris]] July 11, 1697{{snd}}January 28, 1782) was a geographer and [[Cartography|cartographer]] who greatly improved the standards of map-making. His maps of ancient geography, characterized by careful, accurate work and based largely on [[Research#Original research|original research]], are especially valuable. He left unknown areas of continents blank and noted doubtful information as such; compared to the lavish maps of his predecessors, his maps looked empty.

==Work==
[[File:CEM-44-La-Chine-la-Tartarie-Chinoise-et-le-Thibet-1734-2568.jpg|thumb|D'Anville's map of China and Central Asia (1734) for [[du Halde]]'s "Description geographique de la Chine", compiled based on the first systematic geographic survey of the entire Chinese Empire by a team of French Jesuits ({{circa|1700}})]]
His passion for geographical research displayed itself from early years: at age of twelve he was already amusing himself by drawing maps for [[Latin]] authors. Later, his friendship with the antiquarian, Abbé Longuerue, greatly aided his studies. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His first serious map, that of [[Ancient Greece]], was published when he was fifteen. At the age of twenty-two, he was appointed one the king's geographers, and began to attract the attention of first authorities. D'Anville's studies embraced everything of geographical nature in the world's literature, as far as he could muster it: for this purpose, he not only searched ancient and modern historians, travelers and narrators of every description, but also poets, orators and philosophers. One of his cherished subjects was to reform geography by putting an end to the blind copying of older maps, by testing the commonly accepted positions of places through a rigorous examination of all the descriptive authority, and by excluding from cartography every name inadequately supported. Vast spaces, which had before been bordered with countries and cities, were thus suddenly reduced mostly to a blank.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

D'Anville was at first employed in the humbler task of illustrating by maps the works of different travellers, such as Marchais, Charlevoix, Labat and [[du Halde]]. For the history of China by the last-named writer he was employed to make an atlas, which was published separately at [[the Hague]] in 1737.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Information for the maps of China came from [[Topographic surveying and mapping|land surveys]] made by the Chinese empire in 1708. His China maps have been called the "standard Western source for the geography of China and adjacent regions," throughout the 19th century.&lt;ref name=WDL1/&gt;

In 1735 and 1736 brought out two treatises on the figure of the earth; but these attempts to solve geometrical problems by literary material were, to a great extent, refuted by [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Maupertuis]]' measurements of a degree within the polar circle. D'Anville's [[historical method]] was more successful in his 1743 map of [[Italy]], which first indicated numerous errors in the mapping of that country and was accompanied by a valuable mémoir (a novelty in such work), showing in full the sources of the design. A trigonometrical survey which [[Benedict XIV]] soon after had made in the papal states strikingly confirmed the French geographer's results. In his later years d'Anville did yeoman service for ancient and medieval geography, accomplishing something like a revolution in the former; mapping afresh all the chief countries of the pre-Christian civilizations (especially Egypt), and by his ''Mémoire et abrégé de géographie ancienne et générale'' and his ''États formés en Europe après la chute de l'empire romain en occident'' (1771) rendering his labours still more generally useful. His last employment consisted in arranging his collection of maps, plans and geographical materials. It was the most extensive in Europe, and had been purchased by the king, who, however, left him the use of it during his life. This task performed, he sank into a total imbecility both of mind and body, which continued for two years, till his death in January 1782.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

==Honors==
In 1754, at the age of fifty-seven, he became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres, whose transactions he enriched with many papers. In 1775 he received the only place in the Académie des Sciences which is allotted to geography; and in the same year he was appointed, without solicitation, first geographer to the king.

The crater [[Anville (crater)|Anville]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him, as was the community of [[Danville, Vermont]].

==Bibliography==
D'Anville's published memoirs and dissertations amounted to 78, and his maps to 211. A complete edition of his works was announced in 1806 by de Manne in 6 vols. quarto, but only two had appeared when the editor died in 1832. See Bon-Joseph Dacier, ''Éloge de d'Anville'' (Paris, 1802). Besides the separate works noticed above, d'Anville's maps executed for Rollin's ''Histoire ancienne'' and ''Histoire romaine'', and his ''Traité des mesures anciennes et modernes'' (1769), deserve special notice.

This is a list of [[Ambassadors of the United States]] to [[Estonia]].

The United States has maintained continuous official [[diplomatic relations]] with Estonia (as well as [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) since 1922, when one ambassador, resident in [[Riga]], Latvia, was appointed to all three nations. Relations with the three nations were broken after the Soviet invasion of the republics in 1940 at the beginning of World War II. The United States never recognized the legitimacy of the Soviet occupation of the three Baltic nations, nor the legitimacy of the governments of those states under Soviet occupation. Hence, diplomatic relations were not resumed until 1991 after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The U.S. Embassy in Estonia is located in [[Tallinn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21788">This is a '''list of countries by easternmost point''' on land (dependent territories included). A selection of dependent territories are listed in ''italics'' and are not ranked.

The order does not always reflect the proximity of the country's territory to the [[180th meridian]]. In such a case there would be three both the very westernmost and the very easternmost countries or territories, Russia, [[Fiji]], and Antarctica, as the [[180th meridian]] passes through them on land. Instead for the number of countries, namely Russia, New Zealand, Fiji, the United States, and [[Kiribati]], which have territory on both sides of the 180th meridian, the given easternmost point of the country is '''the easternmost point in the direction of travel'''. The United States and Kiribati have most of their territory east of the 180th meridian, in the Western Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the [[List of countries by westernmost point|westernmost]] countries with their territory stretching as far to the west as beyond the 180th meridian into the Eastern Hemisphere. Conversely, Russia, New Zealand, and Fiji have most of their territory west of the 180th meridian, in the Eastern Hemisphere, so they are considered to belong to the easternmost countries with their territory stretching as far to the east as beyond the 180th meridian into the Western Hemisphere.

This is a '''list of countries with Jollibee franchises'''. This list only includes the [[Jollibee]] fast food chain brand of [[Jollibee Foods Corporation]] (JFC) and excludes other brands owned by the company.

As of November 2016, Jollibee operates at 1,111 Jollibee stores, 954 of which are in the Philippines, its country of origin, and 157 are situated in foreign markets.&lt;ref name=italycanada&gt;{{cite news|last1=Austria|first1=Jenniffer|title=Jollibee to build first Italy, Canada stores|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/business/222563/jollibee-to-build-first-italy-canada-stores.html|accessdate=16 December 2016|publisher=Manila Standard|date=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported in a 1990 article in the ''[[Washington Times]]'', Jollibee had two locations in [[Taiwan]] and one in the [[Brunei]] along with 58 locations in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="wt-1990may31"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WSTB&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB0EED2689D3848&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=McDonald's feels sting of archenemy in Philippines |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=May 31, 1990 |page=C1 |first=Kevin |last=Hamlin |subscription=yes |quote=McDonald's is fighting back with a determined effort to catch its upstart rival. Last year it opened eight new outlets, a big increase on the four to five new restaurants opened in each of the previous few years. It now has 25 outlets, compared to Jollibee's 58. But Jollibee opened nine new outlets last year and plans another 10 in 1990... That means Americans and Canadians on the West Coast of North America will soon be sampling Jollibee's Yumburgers, Champs and Chicken Joy. It plans to open "pilot" stores in key West Coast cities within three years and is also looking to expand into the Middle East. Jollibee already has opened two stores in Taiwan and one in the affluent Sultinate of Brunei. Its flexible approach to customer requirements has continued overseas. In Taiwan, it has added a fish fillet sandwich... Jollibee found the Taiwanese didn't like its sweet spaghetti sauce and so made it "more bland." In Muslim Brunei, it calls its hamburgers beefburgers and is certified as a restaurant that prepares food according to Muslim law. "You have to adjust to their customs and religion," Mr. Sumulong said. "They won't eat 'hamburgers' because pork is forbidden." The same flexible approach will be used to spearhead expansion into North America and help the company achieve its goal of becoming a 200-store chain by 1995.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1995 article in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Jollibee had five locations in Brunei, two in Jakarta, Indonesia, and one in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates along with 160 locations in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="wsj-1995oct03"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/djreprints/doc/398474745.html |title=Philippines' Largest Fast-Food Chain Looks to Extend Its Overseas Reach |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=October 3, 1995 |edition=Eastern |first=Rexie |last=Reyes |subscription=yes |quote=It already has eight stores abroad: five in Brunei, two in Jakarta, Indonesia, and one in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates... In the Philippines, Jollibee has 160 outlets... Jollibee plans to enter foreign markets through franchising agreements. The company is hesitant about opening outlets abroad through joint ventures because when it first started expanding overseas several of its joint ventures ran into trouble, says Raffy dela Rosa, vice president finance, referring to the company's two Jakarta outlets, which opened about four years ago. "The problem was more of entry positioning," he says, adding that Jollibee has solved the problem by turning the Indonesian stores into franchises this year. Jollibee's first overseas store opened in Brunei in 1988.}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/398474745/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2011, Jollibee had 31 locations in Vietnam, 27 in the United States, 11 in Brunei, 7 in Saudi Arabia (all in Jeddah), and 1 each in Hong Kong and Qatar along with 747 locations in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ps-2012jan25"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/business/770591/jollibee-completes-purchase-50-superfoods-group |title=Jollibee completes purchase of 50% of SuperFoods Group |newspaper=[[Philippine Star]] |date=January 25, 2012 |first=Zinnia B. |last=Dela Peña}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
Jollibee had two branches on the island of [[Saipan]] in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], a U.S. territory. The first location was opened in the village of [[Garapan]] in late 1999.&lt;ref name=st-1999dec10&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/953a587b-1dfb-11e4-aedf-250bc8c9958e/ |title=Jollibee…let’s do lunch, babe |newspaper=[[Saipan Tribune]] |date=December 10, 1999 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second location was opened in the village of [[Chalan Kanoa]] in January 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Second Jollibee store opens in January |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/965320f9-1dfb-11e4-aedf-250bc8c9958e/ |accessdate=2 November 2015 |newspaper=[[Saipan Tribune]] |date=31 October 2000 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chalan Kanoa branch was closed in 2004&lt;ref name=st-2004jul08&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/9fe147d7-1dfb-11e4-aedf-250bc8c9958e/ |title=Jollibee outlet shuts down |newspaper=[[Saipan Tribune]] |date=July 8, 2004 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the main Garapan branch closed in February 2009 due to declining sales.&lt;ref name="NMIclose"&gt;{{cite news |title=Jollibee to close in Feb. |url=http://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/b3271073-1dfb-11e4-aedf-250bc8c9958e/ |accessdate=2 November 2015 |newspaper=[[Saipan Tribune]] |date=26 November 2009 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the island of [[Guam]], another U.S. territory, Jollibee had opened a location there in 1996&lt;ref name=upi-1996jan09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1996/01/09/Manila-fastfood-earns-big-in-Guam/4851821163600/ |title=Manila fastfood earns big in Guam |newspaper=[[United Press International]] |date=January 9, 1996 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later closed the branch sometime before 2009.&lt;ref name="NMIclose"/&gt; A second location was reported to have opened in the [[Agana Shopping Center]] in February 2000.&lt;ref name="pdn-2000feb18"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/guampdn/doc/910417695.html |title=Jollibee opens in Hagatna |newspaper=[[Pacific Daily News]] |date=February 18, 2000 |page=A61 |last=Jojola |first=Lloyd |subscription=yes}} [http://search.proquest.com/docview/910417695/ Alternate Link] via [[ProQuest]].&lt;/ref&gt; There are no records on when the second location had closed, but no Jollibee locations are known to exist on the island of Guam by 2009.  

Jollibee also had a branch in [[Papua New Guinea]] which opened in 1997 in [[Port Moresby]]. The branch closed following the publication of a newspaper print advertisement that falsely implied that the local branch was trying to purchase dogs and cats as a source of food. Jollibee was unable to track down those responsible for the ad but had suspected several competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=John L. |last1=Thompson |first2=Frank |last2=Martin |last-author-amp=yes |title=Strategic management : awareness and change |date=2005 |publisher=Thomson Learning |location=London [u.a.] |isbn=1844800830 |page=769 |edition=5th |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=INy2SHeqMhwC&amp;lpg=PA769&amp;ots=v6vus8bTYQ&amp;dq=jollibee%20in%20papua%20new%20guinea%20-prezi&amp;pg=PA769#v=onepage&amp;q=jollibee%20in%20papua%20new%20guinea%20-prezi&amp;f=false |via=[[Google Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Market House''' in [[Newtownards]], [[County Down]], [[Northern Ireland]], is a historic building.  It was built during 1767-1771&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC27HPQ_newtownards-historical-series-9-the-market-house?guid=92e77800-b15f-47eb-9a76-b1b9ac4107d9 Newtownards Historical Series #9 The Market House]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Robert Stewart, 1st Marquess of Londonderry]] to be the center of the market town, in lieu of the [[Newtownards Priory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ulsterscotstrail.com/newtownards/market-house Ulster Scots Heritage Trail: Market House]&lt;/ref&gt;It has served as a prison and as a [[town hall]].  It is currently the '''Newtownards Arts Centre''' is also the home of the [[Ards Historical Society]]. 

It was built of [[Scrabo stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturenorthernireland.org/features/heritage/history-newtownards |title=The History of Newtownards |publisher=Culture Northern Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing at the north end of Conway Square in Newtownards' town centre, the Market House was built in 1770s to a design of Ferdinando Stratford, a bridge and river engineer from [[Bristol]] in England. The ground floor was originally an open space where a market could be held and was entered  from Conway Square through a central archway which was fitted with gates that could be opened and closed at night. The upper floor had an assembly room over the west wing with a drawing room in the east wing, now known as the Londonderry Room. 

Originally the market was held inside the market house, but the tradition which remains today and is now held outside in Conway Square each Saturday. 

[[File:Town Hall, Newtownards - geograph.org.uk - 643446.jpg|left|thumb]]
The Market House was also used as a military base during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rebellion against British rule]], housing a regiment of the York [[Fencibles]] under the command of Colonel Stapleton.  Prison cells which were on either side of the archway and can be seen today from inside the ground floor of the building.  Many years later the Market House was used as the local Town Hall, but today it is used as an Arts Centre.  The drawing room on the upper floor (now the Londonderry Room) is still used for meetings and exhibitions.

The '''Mediterranean Ridge''' is a wide [[ridge]] in the bed of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], running along a rough quarter circle from [[Calabria]], south of [[Crete]], to the southwest corner of [[Turkey]], and from there eastwards south of [[Cyprus]] and Turkey.

It is an [[accretionary wedge]] caused by the [[African Plate]] [[subduction|subducting]] under the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] and [[Anatolian Plate|Anatolian]] plates.  As the African Plate moves slowly north-northeastward, it is plowing up the [[Igneous rock|igneous]] and [[sedimentary rock]]s of the Mediterranean seafloor, lifting them from the seabed and creating Cyprus and other islands along the ridge.

Along the ridge, five deep basins full of [[Anoxic sea water|anoxic]] [[brine]] have been found, where [[Messinian evaporite]] deposits of brine caught up in this ongoing [[orogeny]] have dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0037073806000625|title=Exhumation of Messinian evaporites in the deep-sea and creation of deep anoxic brine-filled collapsed basins|journal=Sedimentary Geology|volume=188-189|pages=357|doi=10.1016/j.sedgeo.2006.03.013|year=2006|last1=Cita|first1=Maria Bianca |authorlink1=Maria Bianca Cita}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the far future, it could grow into a long high mountain range if the continued [[African Plate|northward movement of Africa]] obliterates the east part of the Mediterranean Sea.

'''Pico da Neblina''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpiku dɐ neˈblĩnɐ}}, ''Mist Peak'') is the highest [[mountain|peak]] in [[Brazil]], {{convert|2995.3|m|ft|0}} above sea level, in the [[Cerro de la Neblina|Serra da Neblina]], part of the [[Serra Imeri|Serra do Imeri]], a section of the [[Guiana Highlands]] on the Brazil–[[Venezuela]] border. As determined by a border survey expedition in 1962, its summit lies just 
within Brazilian territory, at a horizontal distance of only {{convert|687|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from the Venezuelan border at [[Pico 31 de Março]].

As the peak's name suggests, it is shrouded in dense clouds most of the time.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  It was first ascended in 1965 by members of a [[Brazilian Army]] expedition.

==Location==

Officially, Pico da Neblina is located in the [[municipality]] of [[Santa Isabel do Rio Negro]], state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]]. However, the mountain is not directly accessible from the urban seat of the municipality, which is about {{convert|180|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away, and federal authority over the national park, the Yanomami reservation and the border security area supersedes municipal authority in all practical respects. The nearest city is actually [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]], about {{convert|140|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a straight line, from where virtually all climbing expeditions depart.

The mountain is contained in the Brazilian [[Pico da Neblina National Park]]; its northern slopes are also protected in Venezuela's [[Serranía de la Neblina National Park]]. The twin parks, together with the neighbouring [[Parima Tapirapecó National Park]] (Venezuela), form a protected area complex of about 80,000&amp;nbsp;km², possibly the largest national park system in tropical rainforests in the world. Pico da Neblina is also located within the territory of the [[Yanomami]] people's reservation.

==Common misconceptions==

Pico da Neblina is often mentioned as being on the exact border between [[Brazil]] and [[Venezuela]]. This is true for its [[massif]] as a whole, but the main summit is wholly in Brazil, 687 metres from the actual border.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.summitpost.org/neblina-peak/663648&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes mentioned as being the highest point in [[South America]] outside of the [[Andes]], but this is not correct either: the title belongs to [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] in [[Colombia]], which is almost twice the height of Pico da Neblina and completely detached from the Andes. However, Pico da Neblina is indeed the highest point ''east'' of the Andes range, and therefore of a large portion of the continent. Neighbouring Pico 31 de Março, which ''is'' on the precise international border, is also the highest point in [[Venezuela]] outside of the Andes.

==Elevation measurements==

For 39 years, based on an uncontested measurement performed in 1965 by [[Topography as the study of place|topographer]] José Ambrósio de Miranda Pombo, using a [[theodolite]], the elevation of Pico da Neblina was thought to be {{convert|3014|m|ft|0}}, but a much more accurate measurement performed in 2004 with state-of-the-art [[GPS]] equipment by [[Cartography|cartographer]] Marco Aurélio de Almeida Lima, a member of a Brazilian army expedition, put it at {{convert|2993.78|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. This was then officially recognised by the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE), the federal government's official geographic survey and census agency, which jointly organised the expedition.&lt;ref name=ibge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saladeimprensa.ibge.gov.br/noticias.html?view=noticia&amp;id=1&amp;idnoticia=267&amp;busca=1&amp;t=picos-bandeira-cristal-ja-tem-novas-altitudes|title=Brazilian peaks have their altitude changed|date=September 13, 2004|publisher=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, IBGE slightly revised again the official altitude of Pico da Neblina to {{convert|2995.30|m|ft}}, a 1.52-metre difference. There was no new expedition or field measurement at the time; the new value is simply a mathematical recalculation of the altitude, based on the previously obtained GPS field data, taking into account a newly available, more precise mapping of the Brazilian territory regarding the [[geoid]] (the imaginary surface based on the [[Earth]]'s [[gravitational field]] that is the reference for altitudes). This explains why Pico da Neblina and Pico 31 de Março, which are next to each other, had both exactly the same altitude correction.&lt;ref name="ibge2016"&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://agenciadenoticias.ibge.gov.br/agencia-noticias/2013-agencia-de-noticias/releases/15275-geociencias-ibge-reve-as-altitudes-de-sete-pontos-culminantes.html |title=Geociências: IBGE revê as altitudes de sete pontos culminantes |language=Portuguese |trans-title=Geosciences: IBGE revises the altitude of seven high points |location=Brasília |publisher=Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) |date=2016-02-29 |accessdate=2018-03-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology and topography==

The [[Neblina Massif]] is composed of a tilted block of sandstone overlying Precambrian [[metamorphic rock]]s. The peak is an impressive sharp rock pyramid or tooth, towering high (when the peak is visible) over the nearby lowlands on the Brazilian side, as the Imeri range quickly rises from only about 100 metres above sea level to about 2,000 metres at the base of the peak in just a few kilometres; from there the peak rises sharply.

The Venezuelan side of the massif is hillier and the altitude gradient to the northern plains is less abrupt, although deep chasms and high walls still exist. Neighbouring [[Pico 31 de Março]] can be considered a secondary summit of Pico da Neblina; it has a smoother, rounder shape and is sometimes difficult to be clearly distinguished from Pico da Neblina on photographs, depending on angle and distance. Due to Pico da Neblina's equatorial latitude, while it can be cold on top, sub-freezing temperatures and frost appear to be rare (no permanent measurements are undertaken), and there is no snow. One non-authoritative source gives an average temperature of {{convert|20|C|F}} during the day and {{convert|6|C|F}} at night.&lt;ref name="suapesquisa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.suapesquisa.com/pesquisa/pico_da_neblina.htm |title=Pico da Neblina |publisher=SuaPesquisa.com |accessdate=2016-03-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
There is little documentation available today on the peak's discovery, and virtually none of it is authoritative, even though Brazilians only discovered the mountain fairly recently, in the mid-20th century. This late discovery can be understood if one remembers how extremely remote, inaccessible and uninhabited that part of the [[Amazon region]] is even today, and that it could hardly be expected that such a high mountain (by Brazilian standards) could be found standing next to the vast, low-lying [[Amazon Basin]], even though it was known that there were mountains in that area. Moreover, as its own name states, Pico da Neblina is clouded and hidden from view most of the time.

All this led to it only being discovered in the 1950s. The exact date and circumstances are obscure and not documented, but a popular story often heard in Brazil says that it was supposedly seen and reported by an airline pilot who overflew it at a luckily cloudless moment. However, the massif was known well before that on the Venezuelan side, where it was called ''Cerro Jimé''. In 1954, eight years before the Pico da Neblina was successfully climbed, the area was visited from the north by an expedition led by botanist [[Bassett Maguire]], who reached the northern summit plateau of the massif and observed the highest peak, then unnamed, estimating it to be between "8,000-9,000&amp;nbsp;feet." The whole massif was named ''Cerro de la Neblina'', since Maguire and Reynolds considered at the time that the massif constituted a separate formation from the Imeri range to the southeast.

Soon after the expedition, the highest peak, although unclimbed, was named ''Pico Phelps'' in honour of eminent ornithologist [[William H. Phelps, Jr.]] At that time, the peak was thought to lie entirely within Venezuelan territory. During the 1962 Brazilian expedition, it was determined that the highest summit lies entirely in Brazil. The Brazilian expedition renamed the summit peak to ''Pico da Neblina'', causing some confusion with the name ''Cerro de la Neblina'', which is used in Venezuela to refer to the whole massif. The subsidiary summit on the Venezuelan-Brazilian border was named ''Pico 31 de Março'' in Brazil, but it is now known as ''Pico Phelps'' in Venezuela.

In the 1950s, it was not yet clear whether Pico da Neblina was in Brazilian or Venezuelan territory, and its precise elevation was not yet known. Therefore, it was still widely held for many years after the peak's discovery that Brazil's highest mountain was [[Pico da Bandeira]] (2,891&amp;nbsp;m or 9,486&amp;nbsp;ft), between the southeastern states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Espírito Santo]], in a much more populated, developed and easily accessible region. Only in 1965 it was found and became widely known that Pico da Neblina was the country's highest mountain. Pico da Bandeira remains the highest Brazilian mountain outside of the Amazon region, and the third highest overall, after Pico da Neblina and 31 de Março.

Due to its location in a national park in a border area that is also part of [[Yanomami]] territory, access to the area is restricted and depends on a special permit by the [[Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation]] (ICMBio), the Brazilian government organisation responsible for national parks. The permit can be obtained at ICMBio's office in [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]], but all climbers must take an accredited local guide. A four-day trek each way should be expected, three of which consisting of a jungle trek in the rainforest that can be as hard and challenging as the climb itself. Rescue is close to impossible in the area.

[[Onchocerciasis]] or "river blindness," a [[Parasitism|parasitic]] disease that can cause permanent [[blindness]] and is transmitted by a [[black fly]], is [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] in the area, albeit with a low incidence; [[malaria]] and [[yellow fever]] transmission are also possible. Therefore, climbers are advised not only to take the utmost precaution in avoiding [[insect bite]]s, but also to discuss preventive and/or therapeutic strategies with qualified physicians who are familiar with [[tropical disease]]s.

Robson Czaban, a Brazilian photographer who climbed Pico da Neblina in 1998, reports on [https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161556/http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/Cabana/5344/neblina.htm his adventure account] (in Portuguese) that there are always some gold [[Placer mining|panners]] on a small plateau just below the peak, at about 2,000 m (6,100&amp;nbsp;ft), called Garimpo do Tucano, which serves as the base camp for the last and steepest part of the climb. While the panners' presence there is technically illegal, they are widely tolerated by Brazilian authorities, and Czaban speculates that this would be because in such a remote area, they are believed to watch the border and nature better than the park rangers and the army would have the means to do. Czaban reports them to be very friendly and helpful.

The '''point of beginning''' is a [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]'s mark at the beginning location for the wide-scale surveying of land.

An example is the [[Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey]] that led to the opening of the [[Northwest Territory]], and is the starting point of the surveys of almost all other lands to the west, reaching all the way to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=441&amp;ResourceType=Site|title=Beginning Point of the U.S. Public Land Survey|accessdate=2007-11-08|work=National Historic Landmark summary listing|publisher=National Park Service|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023013601/http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=441&amp;ResourceType=Site|archivedate=2007-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 30, 1785, [[Thomas Hutchins]], first and only Geographer of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=70281 Fort Steuben History]&lt;/ref&gt; began surveying the [[Seven Ranges]] at the point of beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Witcher |first=T.

In 1570, this dike prevented the flooding of [[North Holland]] during the [[All Saints' Flood (1570)]] after the breakthrough of the Hondsbossche Zeewering.]]
A '''sleeper dike''' (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''slaperdijk'') is a [[Dike (construction)|dike]] which does not normally face water, but serves as a backup if a "front-line" dike in front of it breaks.

The sleeper dikes are usually located at places where there is a high risk of dike breakthrough or where there used to be such a risk. The dike is only potentially safeguarding the land from the sea/river, and is "sleeping", hence the name. Sometimes there is even a secondary sleeper dike, which can be called a "[[dreamer dike]]". 

Many of the sleeper dikes are historical, and no longer have a function in protection against the water, after the dike improvements of the [[Delta Plan]] . However, in case of a breakthrough they do divide up the land in sections, and therefore stop the waterflow in some parts, and slow down in others. Also many of these dikes are protected because of their cultural historical and ecological value.

==Background==
Tony Binns was born in [[Prestwich]] and grew up in Bury, Greater Manchester, UK. He attended Stand Grammar School,&lt;ref&gt;Demolished 2001. http://www.prestwichandwhitefieldguide.co.uk/news/prestwich_history/8259040.Stand_Grammar___s_rescue/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whitefield, Greater Manchester|Whitefield]]. He graduated from [[Sheffield University]] (Geography, 1970; Dip.Ed., 1971) and taught geography in schools while attending the [[University of Birmingham]] (MA African Studies 1973; PhD African Studies and Geography, 1981). He taught geography at [[University of Sussex]] from 1975-2004, before moving to the [[University of Otago]] as Professor and latterly Head of Department.

Binns has two children, and holds British and New Zealand citizenship.

==Scholarly Contributions==

Binns' prime interest is African community development and the livelihoods and wellbeing of Africans. His early work was in [[Sierra Leone]], working from [[Kaima|Kayima]] in the north east of the country on links between diamond mining and the farming sector, the two main occupations of local residents. He has continued to follow these trends since 1974, and in 2014 he was elected an honorary chief of Kayima for his continued support to the community.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Exauhkk9Kyc&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then he has worked in 
*South Africa (local economic development initiatives, community-based institutions and empowerment in South Africa, exporting ‘alternative’ foods and [[fair trade]], livelihoods of the West Coast region including wildflower harvesting, and the ‘Working for Water’ programme) 
*Sierra Leone (agricultural development and change in the Eastern Province; reconstruction and development in the post-conflict period; integrated rural development; urban and peri-urban farming in Freetown) 
*Nigeria (urban and peri-urban agricultural production in [[Kano]], pressures facing pastoral livelihoods in northern Nigeria, pastoral-farmer conflict, and degradation in the Kano close-settled zone)
*Morocco (small-scale irrigation development in the High Atlas mountains) 
*The Gambia (export-orientated horticultural production)
*Zambia (urban and peri-urban agricultural production in Lusaka, urban agriculture in the Zambian Copper Belt) 
*Kenya (relationships between farming and fishing in the Kenyan sector of Lake Victoria).

He has also worked in 
*Samoa (the role of the church in development) 
*Vietnam (urban and peri-urban agricultural production in Hanoi) 
*and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geography.otago.ac.nz/people/academic/tony_binns&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
*President of the Geographical Association 1994-1995
*Leverhulme Study Abroad Fellowship 2000-2001 (at [[Rhodes University]]), South Africa

'''Vlatava''' is a fictional country in the [[DC Comics]] Universe.  Vlatava is a small eastern European country that fell under the domination of the [[Soviet Union]] and was later devastated by [[Spectre (DC Comics character)|The Spectre]]. The country had a long-standing history of cleansing genocides, blood feuds and internal wars lasting for decades.

The supervillain [[Count Vertigo]] was the last, surviving descendant of the royal family of Vlatava. His status as a political figure was frequently exploited in storylines, though he made little effort to reclaim his throne. The Count's insanity also allowed him to be manipulated easily, until after being sent to rehabilitation after being manipulated by Poison Ivy allowed his system to be cleaned and get a better grip on Vlatava's situation.

When [[John Ostrander]] was writing The Spectre, all inhabitants of Vlatava, with the exception of Vertigo and the current president, were murdered by the titular spirit. The Spectre believed that Vlatava had degenerated so far that all its inhabitants were doomed to die in wars or starve. He was tried by the Courts of Heaven by this act - and acquitted, as his judgment had been accurate.This left the country in ruins, which the Spectre used to bind the Spear of Destiny and cast it into orbit. With this, the last of the Vlatavans of old are the former President himself and Count Vertigo.

==In other media==
* In ''[[DC Showcase: Green Arrow]],'' Count Vertigo has assassinated his brother to get the throne, and then sets his sights on his young niece, Perdita. He hired [[Merlyn (DC Comics)|Merlyn]] to kill her in an American airport, but [[Green Arrow]] and [[Black Canary]] happen to be present and intervene.
* In ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' (co-created by [[Greg Weisman]], who wrote the above) Vlatava is ruled by Queen Perdita, a ten-year-old in an American hospital for a heart transplant. Her uncle Count Vertigo hopes to kill her by teaming up with [[Vandal Savage]] to prevent [[Wally West|Kid Flash]] from delivering her donor heart. The country is also briefly seen in the episode "Happy New Year".

'''Ximending''' ({{zh|t={{linktext|西門町}}|p=Xīméndīng|w=Hsi-men-ting|poj=Se-mn̂g-teng}}; [[Romaji]]: {{nihongo|||Seimon-chō}}; sometimes Ximenting) is a neighborhood and shopping district in the [[Wanhua District]] of [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. It was the first [[pedestrian zone]] in Taiwan.

==Overview==
Ximending has been called the "[[Harajuku]] of Taipei" and the "[[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]] of Taipei".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2009/5/30/lifetravel/3685902&amp;sec=lifetravel%20TP%20Master%20Planning%20(master%20plan%20page)%20 |title=Talking about Taipei |publisher=The Star Online |date=2009-05-30 |accessdate=2010-07-12 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="videotaiwan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videotaiwan.org.tw/english/The-Red-House/The-Red-House/|title=The Red House (The Red Theater)|publisher=Video Taiwan Foundation|accessdate=2010-07-12}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waakao.com/en/buzz/past/396-visitors-guide-to-taipei |title=A Visitor's Guide to Taipei |publisher=Waakao.com |date=2009-09-04 |accessdate=2010-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918170509/http://www.waakao.com/en/buzz/past/396-visitors-guide-to-taipei |archivedate=September 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/travel/21Taipei.html|title=Feasting at the Table of Taipei|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-09-21|accessdate=2010-07-12 | first=Matt | last=Gross}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ximending is the source of Taiwan's fashion, subculture, and Japanese culture. Ximending has a host of clubs and pubs in the surrounding area. This area is in the northeastern part of Wanhua District in Taipei and it is also the most important consumer district in the Western District of Taipei. The well-known Ximending Pedestrian Area was the first pedestrian area built in Taipei and is the largest in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="increase"&gt;{{cite news |author=Mo Yan-Chih | title=Taipei increases area of special Ximending zone | publisher=Taipei Times| url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/06/18/2003415053 | date=2008-06-18 | accessdate=2009-07-14 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ximenting Day view 201506.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ximending is a popular shopping district for young people.]]

==Access==
Because many bus lines gather on Zhonghua Road, Ximending is also an important area for bus transfers. Ximending is also accessible via exit 6 of the [[Taipei Rapid Transit System|Taipei Metro]] [[Ximen Station]] ([[Bannan line (Taipei Metro)|Bannan Line]] and [[Songshan–Xindian line (Taipei Metro)|Songshan-Xindian Line]]).

==History==

===Name===
The Ximending Pedestrian Area is named after the administrative division {{nihongo||西門町|Seimon-chō}}, which existed during [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], referring to an area outside the west gate of the city. The area of Seimon-chō included modern-day Chengdu Road (成都路), Xining South Road (西寧南路), Kunming Street (昆明街), and Kangding Road (康定路). However, today the Ximending Pedestrian Area not only includes Seimon-chō but also {{nihongo||若竹町|Wakatake-chō}} and {{nihongo||新起町|Shinki-chō}}. The historical spelling of this area was '''Hsimenting''', which is based on the [[Wade–Giles]] romanization of [[Standard Chinese]]. The use of the character {{nihongo||町|chō}} is unusual in a Chinese context: it denotes a [[List of towns in Japan|chō]] (a part of a [[Wards of Japan|ward]]) in the [[Municipalities of Japan|Japanese municipality system]].

[[Image:Ximending Side Alley at Night.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ximending side alley at night.]]

===Origin===
The name of Ximending was derived from its position outside the west gate of Taipei City. In the beginning of Japanese rule, the area was still wilderness, through which there was a road connecting the west gate to the town of Bangka (now called [[Wanhua District|Wanhua]]).&lt;ref name="videotaiwan" /&gt; Later, the Japanese decided to follow the example of [[Asakusa]] in Tokyo to set up an entertainment and business area.&lt;ref name="videotaiwan" /&gt; The earliest entertainment facilities constructed included the Taihokuza in 1897, Eiza (now called New Wanguo Market) in 1902, and the [[Red House Theater]] in 1908.&lt;ref name="redhouse"&gt;{{cite news |author=Mo Yan-chih | title=FEATURE: `Fashion market' helping revive area | publisher=Taipei Times |page=2 | url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2007/08/27/2003376001 | date=2007-08-07 | accessdate=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theater street===
Ximending became a well-known theater street in Taipei in the 1930s and grew even more prosperous after the defeat of Japan. In the 1950s, every theater was full to capacity and scalpers ran wild. Gradually, more theaters opened one after another; At one point, Wuchang St Section 1 had over ten theaters. However, in the 1990s, as Taipei City developed toward the [[Eastern District of Taipei|Eastern District]] and away from Ximending, it began to lose business. In 1999, the city government and local stores established Ximending as a pedestrian area, prohibiting the entrance of vehicles on weekends and national holidays, a move that attracted young consumers and brought back business.&lt;ref name="increase" /&gt; Today, Ximending has over twenty theaters and six thousand vendors, and is a popular area for small concerts, album launches, and street performances. It is also home to the [[Red Envelope Club]]s set up in the 1960s.

[[Image:RedTheaterTaipei.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The historic [[Red House Theater]] in Ximending.]]

===Historic sites===
Because of its history, Ximending is home to several historical sites. Built during Japanese rule, Ximending [[Mazu (goddess)|Mazu]] Temple is an important historical temple. Originally opened as a market, the [[Red House Theater]] is another prominent building from the Japanese era.

The namesake West Gate and the [[walls of Taipei]] were torn down in 1905. Chunghwa Market used to extend to this area, but was demolished in 1992.

==Popularity==
Ximending attracts an average of over 3 million shoppers per month.&lt;ref name="increase" /&gt; It has been called the "[[Harajuku]] of Taipei". The local bookstores sell Japanese magazines, books, CD albums, and clothing, making it a haven for the "Harizu", or Japanese culture adorers.&lt;ref name="videotaiwan" /&gt; Individual vendors gather in the streets as well as the large business buildings, such as Wannien Department Store and Shizilin Square during the day, and Wanguo Department Store and [[Eslite Bookstore|Eslite 116]] later at night.

Due to the density of young people, Ximending is comparable to [[Shilin Night Market]] and the [[Eastern District of Taipei|Eastern District]] to be areas with the highest crime rates. In addition, Ximending is well known for [[Enjo kōsai#Taiwan|student prostitution]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Transportation==
Ximending is accessible within walking distance North West from [[Ximen Station]] of the [[Taipei Metro]].

'''Ye Chunji'''  ({{zh|c=葉春及}}; 1532&amp;ndash;1595) was a [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|Chinese county official]] and scholar during the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368&amp;ndash;1644) of [[China]].

==Life and career==
He was a native of [[Guangdong]] province and served as a county official of [[Huian County]] in [[Fujian]] province.&lt;ref name="brook 15 199"&gt;Brook, 15, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Topography|topographic]] features were part of [[History of cartography#China|maps in China for centuries]], Ye was the first to base county maps on on-site topographical [[surveying]] and observations.&lt;ref name="brook 15"&gt;Brook, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His career was sidelined for seventeen years after he became a victim of political vengeance.&lt;ref name="brook 15"/&gt; He came up with a model of county commerce with goods of greatest, great, and lesser importance—the latter being non-subsistence surplus goods that could be traded out of the county for commercial profit.

He issued an order to limit wedding expenses in the 1570s, stating "The frugal man with only one bar of silver currency can have something left over, whereas the extravagant man with a thousand can still not have enough".&lt;ref name="brook 208"&gt;Brook, 208.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the elites of Huian county and others did not care much for fiscally conservative warnings such as this, and flaunted their wealth in silver.&lt;ref name="brook 208"/&gt;

==Model of county commerce==
Ye Chunji came up with a ranking model for consumptionary products on the local level that could be applied to his county and many others in the empire.&lt;ref name="brook 199"&gt;Brook, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; At the top of this pyramid was the "greatest" (''zui'') product, which was grain; this vital item of subsistence was not traded out of the county as a commercial item.&lt;ref name="brook 199"/&gt; Taxes were paid in grain throughout the Ming Dynasty, but as early as 1436 a portion of the grain tax was commuted to payments of silver instead;&lt;ref name="brook xx"&gt;Brook, xx.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1581 Single Whip Reform of [[Zhang Juzheng]] finally assessed land taxes entirely in silver and not in grain.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, xxi, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The middle level of importance in Ye's pyramid of county-level consumptionary goods were so-called "great" (''zhong'') products, which were [[mulberry]], [[cotton]], [[hemp]], and [[ramie]], the essential raw materials for local textile production.&lt;ref name="brook 199"/&gt; The lowest level in Ye's pyramid of goods were the "lesser" (''ci'') products, which were salt, cloth, vegetable oil, lumber, sugar, fruit, vegetables, fish, and livestock—all of which were traded out of the county by peddlers, itinerant retailers, or merchant wholesalers shipping large amounts of commercial goods.&lt;ref name="brook 199"/&gt; 

Ye Chunji noted that most of these goods from his county made their way to the nearby [[Prefecture (China)|prefectural]] capital at [[Quanzhou]].&lt;ref name="brook 199"/&gt; He also noted that outsiders handled the trade in his county and many other Fujian county, which often led to profits being repatriated out of the local county.&lt;ref name="brook 199 200"&gt;Brook, 199&amp;ndash;200.&lt;/ref&gt; He did note, however, that linen produced from the county's production of hemp did generate profit that entered the county from outside.&lt;ref name="brook 200"&gt;Brook, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]] writes that Ye's description of his county gives the impression that most counties in the Ming Dynasty relied on self-sufficient agriculture and textile production while they were largely unaffected by and disengaged with regional commodity networks between large urban markets.&lt;ref name="brook 200"/&gt;
