'''AMIS''' is an [[Internet service provider]] (ISP) in [[Slovenia]], providing nationwide solutions for more than 105.000 domestic and business users with leading electronic communications and entertainment services. Company is situated in [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]].

==Historic Overview==

The Company was established on May 15, 1995, as the first specialized internet service provider in Slovenia. 
In order to expand and provide internet services for the Slovenian market, in 1997 internet network Amis was established in the framework of the Company. Amis thus became a Brand, holder of all market services and products still today.

In the early stages, '''before entering of financial investors,''' Amis was based predominantly on its own sources, simple organization and focusing on niche market segments. The achieved business success led to admittance of new investors in 2006, namely investment funds [[Iris Capital]] (France) and KBC (Belgian) which enabled fast growth, large-scale expansion of activities and trebled number of staff of the Company.

==Amis today==

Today, Amis is the sole provider of telecommunication services with long tradition and continuous growth. Nationwide Slovenian market is being covered by Amis' services.

==Network and Services==

In all years of its existence Amis relied on its tradition of the '''first alternative provider of broadband access'''. The company built the largest alternative ADSL 2+ network in Slovenia and in 2011 started to market broadband services on optical network of the national operator.

AMIS also markets TDMoIP and VoIP services to corporate and residential users. Since 2013 AMIS extended the technical product portfolio with the introduction of VDSL2 mainly for corporate users.

In the segment of domestic users, '''Amis Televizija''' represents the key platform for development and marketing of leading [[IPTV]] services and other contents and thus becoming the centre of entertainment in households. It is easily accessible via [[Set top box|STB]], mobile telephone, personal or tablet computer.

'''Achilleion''' is an early [[Neolithic]] site in [[Thessaly]], Greece. It was partly excavated by the American archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]]. Achilleion is a large site that is practically untouched by archaeologists which Gimbutas claims to be filled entirely with Neolithic debris and hundreds of Neolithic mounds. An excavation was planned because the dig was expected to have a high yield of artifacts and if successful would possibly provide proof of an earlier age of European Neolithic settlement then was previously known. Excavation was started because it was expected that they would find significant numbers of preceramic Neolithic remains. The work started by Marija Gimbutas was stopped because the dig failed to yield any significant findings, but Gimbutas claims that the dig was interrupted by the political unrest caused by the Cyprus conflict. 
#  Location
#  The Excavation
#  The Findings

'''Location''': Achilleion is located in modern-day Greece, in an area now known as Thessaly. Thessaly lies in northern Greece, just south of Macedonia. Thessaly is best known as a popular vacation spot with beautiful scenery, but it was also believed to be filled with artifacts that could give scientists important clues to past civilizations.

'''The Excavation''': The excavation was funded by UCLA in 1973 and 1974 during the months of August and September. The dig was also supported by the National Science Foundation and the Samuel H. Kress foundation. The dig team consisted of Marija Gimbutas leading the excavation along with 40 other students and scholars.

'''The Findings''': While the excavation was still in progress, there were four test pits dug each about 5 meters deep. Some useful things were recovered from the site; samples of preserved fauna, pottery, and 3 houses were discovered. Unfortunately, Gimbutas overlooked important details when reporting on her excavation, “No geologic, geomorphologic, sedimentologic, or pedologic study was carried out- a serious failing” (McPherron).

The '''Asia Pacific Exchange and Co-operation Foundation''' (APECF) is a [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese-government]]-backed organisation, based in [[Hong Kong]].  It is controversially planning to invest US$3&amp;nbsp;billion in the small [[Nepal]]ese town of [[Lumbini]], birthplace of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], to create a 'Mecca' for Buddhists of all strands.&lt;ref name=Economist1&gt;"[http://www7.economist.com/node/21526389 At Buddha’s birthplace] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823123739/http://www7.economist.com/node/21526389 |date=August 23, 2011 }}", ''The Economist'', 20 Aug 2011. Retrieved 22 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, it was reported in the Chinese media to have signed an agreement with the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] for the project, which will help Lumbini "transcend religion, ideology and race" in its work to rejuvenate the culture and spirit of Buddhism, according to executive vice chairman [[Xiao Wunan]].&lt;ref name=Economist1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily1&gt;"[http://english.sina.com/life/p/2011/0717/381394.html Foundation, UN to transform Buddha's birthplace]", ''China Daily'', 18 July 2011. Retrieved 22 Aug 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The investment is enormous, constituting almost ten percent of [[Economy of Nepal|Nepal's gross domestic product]]. However, neither the Nepalese government nor the local authorities were consulted about the project, they say.&lt;ref name=Economist1/&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily1/&gt;

==Organisation==
The joint chairmen of APECF have varied backgrounds.  They include [[Steven C. Rockefeller, Jr.|Steven Clark Rockefeller Jr]], a fifth-generation member of the Rockefeller family; [[Jack Rosen]], chairman of the [[American Jewish Congress]]; [[Leon Charney]], a real estate tycoon and former US presidential adviser; [[Prachanda]], leader of the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and former [[List of Prime Ministers of Nepal|Prime Minister of Nepal]]; and [[Paras, Crown Prince of Nepal|Paras]], the former Nepali crown prince whose father's monarchy was overthrown by Prachanda's forces.  The executive vice-chairman of the foundation is [[Xiao Wunan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1933">The '''Berber Academy''' ({{lang-fr|Academie Berbere}};{{Lang-kab| Agraw imaziɣen}}) is a cultural association founded in 1966 by [[Mohand Arav Bessaoud]] and a group of young [[Kabyle people|Kabyles]], including [[Ramdane Haifi]]. This group consisted of intellectuals, artists and journalists, all eager to put the [[Tifinagh]] in use. Fearing misuse of the term "academy", they renamed the association '''Agraw Imaziɣen''' (Berber Assembly) in 1967. This was dissolved in 1978.

==Berber alphabet standard==
The Academy proposed a Berber alphabet standard on the basis of Tifinagh circulated in [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] - among them [[:Kabyles]], [[Tuareg people|Tuaregs]], and [[Riffians]] - in order to revive old writing of several millennia, and transcribe all Berber dialects. Periodically, and often in Tifinagh, the organization published the journal ''[[Imazighen (journal)|Imazighen]]''.

The academy also proposed the design of the [[Berber flag]].

Starting in 2004, Edwards then was the host of ''[[The Bob Edwards Show]]'' on [[Sirius XM Radio]] and ''[[Bob Edwards Weekend]]'' distributed by [[Public Radio International]] to more than 150 public radio stations. Those programs ended in September 2015.

==Personal life and early career==
Edwards is a graduate of [[St. Xavier High School (Louisville)]] and the [[University of Louisville]] and began his radio career in 1968 at a small radio station in [[New Albany, Indiana]], a town located across the [[Ohio River]] from Louisville. Afterwards, Edwards served in the [[U.S. Army]], producing and anchoring TV and radio news programs for the [[American Forces Korea Network]] from [[Seoul]]. Following his army service, he went on to anchor news for [[WTOP-FM|WTOP]]/1500, a [[CBS]] affiliate, in [[Washington, D.C.]] He also earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in communication from [[American University]] in Washington D.C. In 1972, at age 25, Edwards anchored national newscasts for the [[Mutual Broadcasting System]]. Edwards joined NPR in 1974. Before hosting ''Morning Edition'', Edwards was co-host of ''[[All Things Considered]]''. Edwards is married to NPR news anchor Windsor Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/phillygossip/120660894.html?mobi=true&lt;/ref&gt; He has two daughters, Eleanor and Susannah, and a stepson, Brean Campbell.

==Host of ''Morning Edition''==
Edwards hosted NPR's flagship program, ''Morning Edition'', from the show's inception in 1979 until 2004. After 24-plus years with Edwards as host, [[Arbitron]] ratings showed that, with 13 million listeners, it was the second highest-rated radio broadcast in the country, behind only [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s AM show. Prior to his departure, he was very popular among both listeners and critics.

When ''Morning Edition'' and its host won a [[Peabody Award|George Foster Peabody Award]] in 1999, the Peabody committee lauded Edwards as 
{{cquote|a man who embodies the essence of excellence in radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/pressrelease.asp?ID=38 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050906024336/http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/pressrelease.asp?ID=38 |date=September 6, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His reassuring and authoritative voice is often the first many Americans hear each day. His is a rare radio voice: informed but never smug; intimate but never intrusive; opinionated but never dismissive. Mr. Edwards does not merely talk, he listens.}}

Edwards' skills as an interviewer have been widely praised. NPR's ombudsman [[Jeffrey Dvorkin]] said, "If I were his producer, I would think of Edwards as NPR's version of [[Charlie Rose]]."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dvorkin |first=Jeffrey A. |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1854657 |title=Bob Edwards Reassigned: Ageism or Just Change? |publisher=NPR |date=2004-04-28 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Daily News]]'' called him "an institution among ''Morning Edition'' listeners for his interviewing skills and his calm, articulate style."&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/176750p-153614c.html |title=New York Celebrity Gossip, Pictures and Entertainment News |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231043951/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/176750p-153614c.html |archivedate=December 31, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that Edwards conducted over 20,000 interviews for NPR. His subjects ranged from major politicians to authors and celebrities. His weekly call-in chats with retired [[sportscaster]] [[Red Barber]] are fondly remembered. The chats were supposedly about sports, but often digressed into topics like the Gulf War, what kind of flowers were blooming at Barber's [[Tallahassee, Florida]] home, or other non-sport subjects. Barber would call Edwards "Colonel Bob," referring to Edwards' [[Kentucky Colonel]] honor from his native state. Barber died in 1992, and the following year Edwards based his first book, ''Fridays with Red: A Radio Friendship'' ({{ISBN|0-671-87013-0}}), on the weekly interviews.

In 2003, Edwards was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame.

==Departure from NPR==

In April 2004, NPR executives decided to "freshen up" ''Morning Edition'''s sound. Edwards was removed as host, replaced with [[Steve Inskeep]] and [[Renée Montagne]], and reassigned as a senior correspondent for NPR News. The move took him by surprise. "I'd rather stay," he said, "but it's not my decision to make."&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt; At first, NPR executives and spokespersons did not fully explain the move, leaving many listeners confused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4586432/ |title=Bob Edwards out as 'Morning Edition' host - Business - US business - msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2004-03-23 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they did make some attempts to explain themselves. According to NPR spokeswoman Laura Gross, "It's part of a natural evolution. A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bob's voice will still be heard; he'll still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt it was time for a change." Executive Vice President [[Ken Stern]] also explained the move. "This change in ''Morning Edition'' is part of the ongoing evaluation of all NPR programming that has taken place over the last several years. We've looked at shows like ''All Things Considered'' and ''Talk of the Nation'' with an eye to how we can best serve listeners in the future."&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt; Although Stern later participated in an online chat with listeners at NPR's website, it only heightened their confusion and anger.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

The decision to remove Edwards, made shortly before his 25th anniversary with the show, was met with much criticism by listeners.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Jeffrey Dvorkin, NPR's ombudsman, reported that the network received over 50,000 letters and emails, most of them angry, regarding Edwards' demotion; the listener reaction was the largest reaction on a single subject that NPR had received to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Peter |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2004-03-23-npr-edwards_x.htm |title=Edwards ousted as 'Morning Edition' host |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2004-03-25 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other journalists, including [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Cokie Roberts]] and [[CBS]]' [[Charles Osgood]], expressed dissatisfaction with the move.

His final broadcast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/rundowns/rundown.php?prgId=3&amp;prgDate=30-Apr-2004 |title=Morning Edition |publisher=NPR |date=2006-05-31 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; as host was on April 30, 2004;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morning Edition |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1863340 |title=Interview: Charles Osgood |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; his last ''Morning Edition'' interview was with [[Charles Osgood]], who had also been Edwards' first Morning Edition interview subject almost 25 years earlier. Coincidentally, the last show also included a segment about the last [[Oldsmobile]], which rolled off an assembly line the day before.

During his final months at NPR, Edwards wrote his second book, ''Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism'' ({{ISBN|0-471-47753-2}}), published in May 2004. The book, a short biography of [[Edward R. Murrow]], brought some public attention to history's most noted broadcast journalist prior to the release of the 2004 film ''[[Good Night and Good Luck]]''. NPR removed Edwards from ''Morning Edition'' that spring rather than waiting for his 25th anniversary with the show in the fall, using the book tour to make a "clean break" rather than bringing him back for a final three-month stint.

Edwards decided not to remain at NPR as a senior correspondent and filed only one story, an interview with [[Bob Dole]] and other Senate veterans of World War II about the Washington, DC, World War II memorial, in that role. Three months after his departure from ''Morning Edition'', [[XM Satellite Radio]] announced that he had signed on to host a new program, ''[[The Bob Edwards Show]]'', for its new [[XM Public Radio]] channel.

His memoir, ''A Voice in the Box'', was published in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Howard Kurtz |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/10/bob-edwards-on-okeefe-sting-npr-is-cursed.html |title=Bob Edwards on O'Keefe Sting: NPR Is Cursed |website=The Daily Beast |date=2011-03-10 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bob Edwards|url=http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/voice-in-the-box-bob-edwards/1100640642?ean=9780813134512&amp;itm=1&amp;usri=a%2bvoice%2bin%2bthe%2bbox%2bbob%2bedwards%2bnook |title=Voice in the Box |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sirius XM Satellite Radio career==
"They want to give me a program, so I can continue to host and be heard every day instead of occasionally, as I would have been at NPR," Edwards told ''[[The Washington Post]]''. He said the format would be "loose": "It'll be long interviews, short interviews, and then maybe departments... You've got to have the news... it's not going to be all features, yet it's not going to be the ''[[Financial Times]]'', either." ''The Bob Edwards Show'''s first broadcast was on October 4, 2004. ''Washington Post'' columnist [[David Broder]] and former [[CBS News]] anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] were Edwards' first guests.

While continuing his daily show on XM, Edwards returned to public radio stations in January 2006 with his show ''Bob Edwards Weekend'', produced by XM Satellite Radio and distributed by [[Public Radio International]] to affiliate stations around the country. A September 22, 2005 press release from PRI states, "''Bob Edwards Weekend'' will provide PRI listeners with an opportunity to sample some of the astute commentary and intriguing interviews offered to XM subscribers each weekday on ''The Bob Edwards Show''." This was the first time that a satellite radio company provided programming to over-the-air terrestrial radio.

''Bob Edwards Weekend'' episodes are no longer available via [[podcast]] at [https://web.archive.org/web/20100904080233/http://www.bobedwardsradio.com/bob-edwards-weekend BobEdwardsRadio.com].

Our sincerest apologies to our devoted listeners."

''The Bob Edwards Show'' has received several awards, including: the Deems Taylor Award from ASCAP (2006); a Gabriel Award from the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals (2006), The National Press Club's Robert L. Kozic Award for Environmental Reporting (2007) for the documentary, "Exploding Heritage," about mountaintop-removal coal mining. That program was also honored with a Gabriel Award, a 2006 New York Festivals Gold World Medal, and an award from the Society of Environmental Journalists.

In 2008, ''The Bob Edwards Show'' received an Edward R. Murrow Award from the [[Radio-Television News Directors Association]] and a New York Festivals/United Nations Gold Award for the documentary, "The Invisible--Children Without Homes." "The Invisible" also was honored by the Journalism Center for Children and Families and by the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals.

In 2009, the show received a [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] from the [[Society of Professional Journalists]] for the documentary, "Stories from Third Med: Surviving a Jungle ER." The documentary also received a [[Gabriel Award]]. In September, 2012, Edwards was named a Fellow of the [[Society of Professional Journalists]]. In 2013, the program was awarded a [[Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award]] for the documentary, "An Occupational Hazard: Rape in the Military." The show's last live episode aired on September 26, 2014. Public Radio International, which paid Sirius XM to broadcast the show on weekends, continued to air reruns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dylan Byers |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2014/08/sirius-xm-to-end-the-bob-edwards-show-194373.html |title= Sirius XM to end The Bob Edwards Show |publisher=Politico.com |date=August 22, 2014 |accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but no longer does.

==Professional life==
In November 2004, Edwards was inducted into the [[National Radio Hall of Fame]]. He continues to offer verbal support for National Public Radio and helps local public radio stations with their fundraisers. Edwards serves on the board of trustees of the [[American Folklife Center]] at the [[Library of Congress]]. He holds honorary degrees from the [[University of Louisville]], [[Spalding University]], [[Bellarmine University]], [[Willamette University]], [[Grinnell College]], [[DePaul University]], the [[University of St. Francis]] and [[Albertson College]] (now the College of Idaho).

'''Canadian Forces Base Goose Bay''' (IATA: '''YYR''', ICAO: '''CYYR'''), commonly referred to as CFB Goose Bay, is a Canadian Forces Base located in the municipality of [[Happy Valley-Goose Bay]] in the province of [[Newfoundland and Labrador]]. It is operated as an air force base by the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF). Its primary RCAF lodger unit is 5 Wing, commonly referred to as 5 Wing Goose Bay.

The airfield at CFB Goose Bay is also used by civilian aircraft, with civilian operations at the base referring to the facility as '''Goose Bay Airport'''. The airport is classified as an [[airport of entry]] by [[Nav Canada]] and is staffed by the [[Canada Border Services Agency]] (CBSA). CBSA officers at this airport can handle [[general aviation]] aircraft only, with no more than 15 passengers.

The mission of 5 Wing is to support the defence of North American airspace, as well as to support the RCAF and allied air forces in training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/5-wing/index.page |title=5 Wing Goose Bay |publisher=Canadian Royal Canadian Air Force |accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5 Wing comprises two units:  [[444 Combat Support Squadron]] (flying the [[CH-146 Griffon]]) and 5 Wing Air Reserve Flight. CFB Goose Bay also serves as a forward operating location for RCAF [[CF-18 Hornet]] aircraft and the base and surrounding area is occasionally used to support units of the [[Canadian Army]] during training exercises.

==History==
While the flat and relatively weather-favored area around [[North West River]] had for years been under consideration for an airport for the anticipated North Atlantic air routes, it was not until Eric Fry of the Dominion Geodetic Survey investigated the area on 1 July 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinfocusmagazine.com/2015/12/a-world-of-opportunities-in-canadas-bright-light-of-the-north/|title=A World of Opportunities in Canada’s Bright Light of the North - Business In Focus|website=www.businessinfocusmagazine.com|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/5-wing/history.page|title=History - 5 Wing Goose Bay- Royal Canadian Air Force|first=Government of Canada, National Defence, Royal Canadian Air|last=Force|website=www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca|accessdate=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Goose Bay location was selected. Fry beat by three days a similar [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) survey team under Captain [[Elliott Roosevelt]]; the American team had first investigated nearby [[Epinette Point]] before joining Fry at the sandy plains that would become Goose Bay. These surveys used amphibian aircraft that landed at the Grenfell mission; from there the teams explored by boat.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, 195-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Fry recalled: "The airport is actually located on the plateau at the west end of Terrington Basin but it is only five miles inland from the narrows between Goose Bay and Terrington Basin. Having a [[Gander International Airport|Gander air base]] in Newfoundland I suggested we call the Labrador site Goose Bay airport and the suggestion was accepted."&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 84–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Under pressure from Britain and the United States the Canadian Air Ministry worked at a record pace, and by November three 7,000-foot gravel runways were ready.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, 111&lt;/ref&gt; The first land aircraft movement was recorded on 9 December 1941. By spring of 1942 the base, now carrying the wartime code-name ''Alkali'', was bursting with air traffic destined for the United Kingdom. In time, the USAAF and the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) each developed sections of the triangular base for their own use, but the airport remained under overall Canadian control despite its location in the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]], not yet a part of Canada. The 99-year lease arrangement with the United Kingdom was not finalized until October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Christie, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aerodrome===
In approximately 1942 the aerodrome was listed as '''RCAF Aerodrome - Goose Bay, Labrador''' at {{coord|53|20|N|60|24|W|region:CA-NL}} with a variation of 35 degrees west and elevation of {{Convert|147|ft|abbr=on}}.  The field was listed as "All hard surfaced" and had three runways listed as follows:&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;Staff Writer c.1942, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeast side of the facility was built to be a temporary RCAF base, complete with its own hangars and control tower, while the south side of the facility, built for the Americans, was being upgraded with its own aprons, hangars, earth covered magazines, control tower and infrastructure.  The Canadian and American bases were built as an RCAF station&lt;ref name="RCAF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airtraining.forces.gc.ca/goosebay/ch3_e.asp|title=Military Presence In Labrador|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071116053558/http://www.airtraining.forces.gc.ca/goosebay/ch3_e.asp|archivedate=16 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later a [[United States Air Force]] base known as '''Goose AB''', housing units of the [[Strategic Air Command]]&lt;ref name="SAC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategic-air-command.com/bases/0-base-homepage2.htm|title=Strategic Air Command Bases|website=www.strategic-air-command.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aerospace Defense Command]]. It was later home to permanent detachments of the RAF, [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]], [[Aeronautica Militare]], and [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]], in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries.

=== Cold War history===
;1950 – The Rivière-du-Loup Incident
{{Main|1950 Rivière-du-Loup B-50 nuclear weapon loss incident}}
Goose Air Base was the site of the first US nuclear weapons in Canada, when in 1950 the [[United States Air Force]] [[Strategic Air Command]] stationed 11 [[Fat Man|model 1561 Fat Man]] atomic bombs at the base in the summer, and flew them out in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clearwater|first=John|title=Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story|year=1998|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd.|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While returning to [[Davis–Monthan Air Force Base]] with one of the bombs on board, a USAF [[Boeing B-50 Superfortress|B-50]] heavy bomber encountered engine trouble, had to drop, and conventionally detonate, the bomb over the St. Lawrence, contaminating the river with [[uranium-238]].

;1954 – Construction of the Strategic Air Command Weapons Storage Area&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Construction of Strategic Air Command's [[Weapon storage area|Weapons Storage Area]] at Goose Air Base was officially completed in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Seaward, DND | first = Larry D. | author-link = | title = Preliminary Information Sheets, Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = | origyear = |date=January 1999  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The area was surrounded by two fences, topped with barbed wire.  It was the highest security area in Goose Air Base and comprised
* One guard house
* One administration building
* Three warehouses (base spares #1, base spares #2, supply warehouse)
* Six guard towers
* One plant group building
* Five earth covered magazines for non-nuclear weapon storage
* Four earth covered magazines for "[[Pit (nuclear weapon)|pit]]" storage (constructed with vaults and shelving to store pit "birdcages")
Design and layout of the Goose Air Base weapons storage area was identical, with only slight modifications for weather and terrain, to the three [[Strategic Air Command]] weapons storage areas in [[Morocco]] located at [[Sidi Slimane Air Base]], [[Ben Guerir Air Base]], and [[Nouasseur Air Base]], which were constructed between 1951 and 1952 as overseas operational storage sites.  
The last nuclear bomb components that were being stored at the Goose Air Base weapons storage area were removed in June 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Norris | first = Robert S | last2 = Arkin | first2 = William M | last3 = Burr | first3 = William | title = Where they were | journal = The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = November–December 1999 | origyear = | url = https://www.archives.gov/declassification/pidb/meetings/where-they-were.pdf | jstor = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1958 – Construction of the Air Defence Command ammunition storage area&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
Construction of the Air Defence Command ammunition storage area at Goose Air Base was completed in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Seaward, DND | first = Larry D. | author-link = | title = Preliminary Information Sheets, Federal Heritage Buildings Review Office | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = | date = 21 January 1999 | origyear = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This extension to the [[Strategic Air Command]] weapons storage area was built directly beside the previously constructed area, with a separate entrance.  The buildings built within the area were:
* Three storage buildings
* One guard house
* One missile assembly building.  
The storage was being built to accommodate components of the [[AIM-26 Falcon|GAR-11/AIM-26 "Nuclear" Falcon]], which is normally stored in pieces, requiring assembly before use.

;1976 – Departure of the USAF Strategic Air Command and closure of Goose AB&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The former U.S. facilities were re-designated CFB Goose Bay (the second time this facility name has been used). The value of the airfield and facilities built and improved by the USAF since 1953 and transferred to Canada were estimated in excess of $250 million (USD).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.  By 1976 all Strategic Air Command assets had been stood down, and only USAF logistical and transport support remained.
&lt;!---The Canadian Forces continued to use Goose Bay for staging interceptor aircraft, however [[Canadian Forces Air Command]] concentrated on purchasing the new [[CF-18]] [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. CF-18s for eastern Canada were to be based at [[CFB Bagotville]] in Quebec, thus the future was looking bleak for both CFB Goose Bay and [[CFB Chatham]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}---&gt;

;1980 – Multinational low level flying training stepped up
In response to lessons learned from the [[Vietnam War]] and the growing sophistication of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] anti-aircraft radar and surface-to-air missile technology being deployed in Europe, NATO allies began looking at new doctrines in the 1970s–1980s which mandated low-level flight to evade detection. CFB Goose Bay's location in [[Labrador]], with a population of around 30,000 and area measuring 294,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, made it an ideal location for low-level flight training. Labrador's sparse settlement and a local topography similar to parts of the Soviet Union, in addition to proximity to European NATO nations caused CFB Goose Bay to grow and become the primary low-level tactical training area for several NATO air forces during the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The increased low-level flights by fighter aircraft was not without serious controversy as the [[Innu]] Nation protested these operations vociferously, claiming{{examples|date=October 2015}} that the noise of aircraft travelling at [[supersonic]] speeds in close proximity to the ground ("nap of the earth flying") was adversely affecting wildlife, namely [[caribou]], and was a nuisance to their way of life on their traditional lands. Many protests evolved into dangerous activities, including trespassing into the low-level flying ranges (at detriment of the safety of protesters), and even to shooting hunting rifles at the fighter aircraft.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

During the 1980s–1990s, CFB Goose Bay hosted permanent detachments from the [[Royal Air Force]], [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]], [[Royal Netherlands Air Force]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;, and the [[Aeronautica Militare]], in addition to temporary deployments from several other NATO countries. The permanent RNAF detachment left CFB Goose Bay in the 1990s, although temporary training postings have been held since.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Goose Bay was a very attractive training facility for these air forces in light of the high population concentration in their countries, as well as numerous laws preventing low-level flying. The thirteen million hectare (130,000 square km) bombing range is larger than several European countries.{{#tag:ref|The thirteen million hectare (130,000 square km) bombing range is larger than [[Iceland]]; [[Portugal]]; [[Serbia]]; [[Austria]]; [[Czech Republic]]; [[Ireland]]; [[Slovakia]]; [[Netherlands]]; [[Denmark]]; [[Switzerland]]; [[Belgium]]. see [[List of countries and dependencies by area]].|group="Note"}}

;1983 – The Space Shuttle Enterprise visits
In 1983, a [[NASA]] [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft|Boeing 747]] transport aircraft carrying the [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Space Shuttle ''Enterprise'']] landed at CFB Goose Bay to refuel on its way to a European tour where the prototype shuttle was then displayed in France and the United Kingdom. This was the first time that a U.S. [[Space Shuttle]] ever "landed" outside the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shuttle Enterprise begins international tour|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/05/16/Shuttle-Enterprise-begins-international-tour/8491421905600/|work=UPI|date=May 16, 1983|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1988 – Long range radar closure
In 1988, the [[Pinetree Line]] radar site ([[Melville Air Station]]) adjacent to CFB Goose Bay was closed.

===Post-Cold War history===
;1993 – Base Rescue Flight and 444 Combat Support Squadron
To provide rescue and range support to the jet aircraft operating from Goose Bay, the [[Canadian Forces]] provided a Base Rescue Flight consisting of three [[UH-1N Twin Huey|CH-135 Twin Huey]] helicopters. In 1993 the Base Rescue Flight was re-badged as 444 Combat Support Squadron and continued to operate the same fleet of three helicopters. In 1996 the CH-135s were replaced with three [[CH-146 Griffon]] helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/5wing/squadron/444hist_e.asp |title = 444 Squadron History |date = 15 June 2007 |author = Air Force Public Affairs / Department of National Defence |accessdate = 2007-10-29 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070126072117/http://www.airforce.forces.gc.ca/5wing/squadron/444hist_e.asp |archivedate = 26 January 2007 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcaf.com/squadrons/400series/444squadron.php |title=No. 444 Squadron |date=n.d. |author=AEROWARE / RCAF.com |accessdate=2007-10-29 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071013214032/http://www.rcaf.com/squadrons/400series/444squadron.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;2001 – 9/11 Operation Yellow Ribbon
On 11 September 2001, CFB Goose Bay hosted seven trans-Atlantic commercial airliners which were diverted to land as part of [[Operation Yellow Ribbon]], following the closure of North American airspace as a result of [[September 11, 2001 attacks|terrorist attacks]] in New York City and Washington, D.C. It was also the first Canadian airport to receive diverted aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

;2005 – Cessation of Multinational Low Level Flying Training&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
In 2004 the RAF announced its intent to close the permanent RAF detachment, effective 31 March 2005. The German and Italian air forces had agreements signed to use the base until 2006, however they were not renewed as of 2004. These air forces still operate at Goose Bay, but plan to initiate simulator training instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/To-Cope-with-Flying-Restrictions-German-Pilots-Turn-to-Simulators-06155/#more-6155|title=To Cope with Flying Restrictions, German Pilots Turn to Simulators|publisher=Defense Industry Daily|date=4 February 2010|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The base continues in its role as a low-level tactical training facility and as a forward deployment location for [[Canadian Forces Air Command]], although the total complement of Canadian Forces personnel numbers less than 100.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

;2005 – Ballistic Missile Defence
Labradorian politicians such as former [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] [[Bill Rompkey]] have advocated using CFB Goose Bay as a site for a [[ballistic missile defense|missile defense]] radar system being developed by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. Executives from defence contractor [[Raytheon Company|Raytheon]] have surveyed CFB Goose Bay as a suitable location for deploying such a radar installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/04/22/missile-labrador050422.html|title=U.S. missile company scouts Labrador|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airlines and destinations==
Civilian flights use a smaller terminal structure located on Zweibrucken Crescent. A new terminal structure was being built in 2012 to accommodate civilian use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/labradormorning/episodes/2012/01/26/a-tour-of-the-new-airport-in-happy-valley-goose-bay-part-1/|title=CBC.ca - Labrador Morning Show - A tour of the New Airport in Happy Valley Goose Bay (Part 1)|date=12 April 2013|work=cbc.ca|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing number of airliners (especially smaller range aircraft like the [[Boeing 757]]) have resorted to using Goose Bay for unplanned fuel stops, especially common for trans-Atlantic flights impacted by a seasonally strong jet stream over the [[North Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2015/01/14/strong-jet-stream-forcing-airliners-to-make-labrador-retrievals.html|title=Strong jet stream forcing airliners to make Labrador retrievals|date=14 January 2015|work=thestar.com|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of civilian airliners using the airfield are not regularly scheduled airlines to this location.

It promotes the protection of revenue through the prevention of smuggling of goods across Ghana's borders. The service protects the boundaries of Ghana by preventing external aggression and promotes territorial integrity of Ghana. The service is a member of Ghana's security services. Import and export restrictions and prohibitions are supervised by the service.&lt;ref name=CEPS/&gt;

The population of [[San Marino]] consists of native Sanmarinese and [[Italy|Italian]] citizens. Crop farming, sheep farming, and the working of stone from the quarries formed the early backbone of San Marino's economy. It has no mineral resources, and today most of the land is cultivated or covered by woods.

The '''Diocese of Lapua''' is one of nine dioceses within the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]. The diocese was founded in 1956 and its current [[bishop]] is Simo Peura.

The diocese attained national attention in September 2015, when Finnish media reported that the diocese had purchased a luxury [[penthouse apartment]] for the bishop's [[official residence]]. Due to the controversy, hundreds of Finns resigned from the church during the days following the media exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eroakirkosta.fi]] [http://www.eroakirkosta.fi/media/none/tiedote_08_2015.html?year=2015 Piispan virka-asunto lisäsi kirkosta eroamista]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DirecTV-10''' is a [[Boeing 702|Boeing model 702]] [[direct broadcast satellite]] that provides [[high definition television]] (HDTV) to DirecTV subscribers in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/702/dtv10-11-12_factsheet.pdf Boeing Directv-10 specifications] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706013155/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/702/dtv10-11-12_factsheet.pdf |date=2008-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched by [[International Launch Services]] on July 7, 2007 from the [[Baikonur Cosmodrome]] in [[Kazakhstan]] aboard an [[Proton (rocket)|Enhanced Proton]] [[Briz-M|Breeze-M]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html Spaceflight Now | Tracking Station | Worldwide launch schedule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811000000/http://www.spaceflightnow.com/tracking/index.html |date=August 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After about two months of in-orbit testing, the satellite was moved to its operating position at 103.0°&amp;nbsp;west longitude.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyngsat.com/Spaceway-1-and-DirecTV-10-12.html Spaceway 1 &amp; DirecTV 10/12 at 102.8°W {{pipe}} LyngSat&lt;/ref&gt; This was the third DirecTV satellite launched on a Proton rocket.  Prior launches include [[DirecTV-8]], which was launched on May 22, 2005, and [[DirecTV-5]], which was launched on May 7, 2002.

DirecTV contracted with Boeing in 2004 to build three identical 702 model satellites&amp;nbsp;— DirecTV-10, [[DirecTV-11|11]] and [[DirecTV-12|12]]. DirecTV-11 was launched on March 19, 2008 and DirecTV-12 was launched on December 29, 2009. The satellites were purchased to significantly increase the number of national and local HDTV channels DirecTV offers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/directv-10.htm Gunter's Space Page - Information on Launch vehicles, Satellites, Space Shuttle and Astronautics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
[[Image:DirecTV 5 LNB Slimline 2012 06 08.jpg|right|thumb|DirecTV AU9-S 5-LNB "Slimline" [[satellite dish]]]]
[[Image:Directv 5lnb dish.jpg|right|thumb|DirecTV AT-9 5-LNB "Sidecar" satellite dish]]
DirecTV-10 transmits [[MPEG-4]] encoded signals, a compression standard which is more efficient than [[MPEG-2]] which DirecTV uses for standard definition and a small number of HD channels. The use of MPEG-4 compression allows the satellite to carry significantly more channels than it could using MPEG-2 compression. Receiving signals from DirecTV-10 requires an advanced receiver capable of decoding MPEG-4 signals, such as the H21 or HR21, and a 5-LNB K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; dish, such as the AT-9 "Sidecar". These receivers also receive MPEG-2 channels and offer interactive services.

DirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 are co-located with the [[SPACEWAY-1]] and SPACEWAY-2 satellites, respectively.  The SPACEWAY satellites were originally designed so that 500&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum would be used for simple one-way broadcasting and 500&amp;nbsp;MHz for a broadband 2-way internet service.  At the request of DirecTV, Boeing disabled the on-board processing payload designed to deliver enhanced connectivity for the 2-way internet service. DirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 use this 500&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum for yet more simple one-way broadcast HDTV.

== B-Band converter ==
[[Image:Bbandcvt.gif|left|thumb|B-Band Converters Connected to DirecTV HR20-700 Receiver]]
Since the 500&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency block (18.3-18.8&amp;nbsp;GHz) used by DirecTV-10 and DirecTV-11 on downlink were not intended for DBS broadcasting, existing equipment cannot receive them without a B-Band Converter (BBC). DirecTV supplies BBCs with all 5-LNB K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;/K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-band dish systems.

The satellite signal from DirecTV-10 is downconverted at the dish to the frequency range of 250-750&amp;nbsp;MHz, called "K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-lo". At the receiver when necessary, the BBC in response to a control signal from the receiver blocks any original "K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-hi" signals between 1650-2150&amp;nbsp;MHz. Then up-converts the 250-750&amp;nbsp;MHz signals to this range which is expected by current receivers. Because this frequency range conflicts with terrestrial broadcast frequencies, any off-the-air (OTA) [[diplexor]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2000networks.com/accessories/switches/multi-switch_zinwell_wb616_6x16.html Zinwell switch with some BBC information]&lt;/ref&gt; must be placed at some point after the BBC.

== Specifications ==
DirecTV-10 uses 32 active and 12 spare [[Ka-band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;-band]] [[Traveling wave tube amplifier]]s (TWTA) to broadcast national programming and 55 active and 15 spare [[spot beam]] TWTAs for local television services. The satellite uses [[bent pipe]] communications. It is powered by a [[solar array]] spanning 48.1 meters that consists of ultra triple junction gallium arsenide solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/702/dtv10-11-12_factsheet.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706013155/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/bss/factsheets/702/dtv10-11-12_factsheet.pdf |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }} Boeing Factsheet for DirecTV 10, 11, 12&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical problems ==
DirecTV reported in a press release on September 14, 2007 that in-orbit testing had uncovered problems with the satellite's spot beam transponders used to broadcast local HDTV channels:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While testing of DIRECTV 10's capability continues, it appears that a portion of the anticipated spot-beam capability may not be fully available. The investigation to determine the cause of the reduced capability and potential means to mitigate its effect is on-going. However, we currently believe our planned expansion of HD local programming as previously announced will not be materially affected.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://dtv.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=286380 DIRECTV 10 In-Orbit Testing Underway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716052836/http://dtv.client.shareholder.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=286380 |date=2011-07-16 }} DirecTV Press Release September 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Amelioration===
According to a May 7, 2010 FCC filing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"DirecTV 10 is currently operating at the 102.815° orbital location. As DirecTV has previously informed the Commission, that satellite suffered a post launch anomaly that has limited the capacity available in certain local markets. DirecTV believes that it can ameliorate this condition, but will need to discontinue commercial service from the satellite and relocate it slightly so that it is not within the cluster of its other operational satellites. Accordingly, DirecTV intends to move DirecTV 10 to the 102.6° position to conduct the restorative procedure. During this migration, DirecTV 10 will continue to provide service to subscribers. However, over the course of this migration, DirecTV intends to transfer all traffic from DirecTV 10 to [[DirecTV-12]], DirecTV's newest satellite which has just completed in-orbit testing and is expected to arrive at the nominal 103° location on or about May 11, 2010. At the conclusion of the STA period, the satellite will be in a position for the corrective procedure to be attempted." &lt;ref&gt;[http://licensing.fcc.gov/myibfs/download.do?attachment_key=815158 DirecTV STA request May 7, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fixes were completed in mid June and DirecTV-10 completed its drift back to its assigned location on June 24, 2010.

The '''flag of Sikkim''' consists of a [[Buddhist]] ''[[khorlo]]'' [[prayer wheel]] with the ''[[gankyil]]'' as the central element.

==Overview==
Until 1967, the previous flag showed a very complex design with a fanciful border and [[ashtamangala|religious pictograms]] surrounding the khorlo.

A more simple design was adopted in 1967 because of the difficulty in duplication of the complex flag. The border became solid red, the pictograms were removed and the wheel was redesigned.

With the [[History of Sikkim#Independent monarchy|annexation]] of [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] to [[India]] and with the abolition of the [[monarchy]], the flag lost its official status.

The '''Gradeshnitsa tablets''' ({{lang-bg|Плочката от Градешница}}) or plaques are clay artefacts with incised marks. They were unearthed in 1969 near the village of [[Gradeshnitsa]] in the [[Vratsa Province]] of north-western [[Bulgaria]].  Steven Fischer has written that "the current opinion is that these earliest Balkan symbols appear to comprise a decorative or emblematic inventory with no immediate relation to articulate speech." That is, they are neither [[logograph]]s (whole-word signs depicting one object to be spoken aloud) nor [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograph]]s (signs holding a purely phonetic or sound value)."&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book |last1= Fischer |first1= Steven Roger |title= History of Writing |date= 2003 |publisher= Reaktion Books |isbn= 9781861891679 |page= 24 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Ywo0M9OpbXoC&amp;pg=PA24 |access-date= 28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets are dated to the 5th millennium BC and are currently preserved in the Vratsa Archeological Museum of Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omda.bg/public/engl/history/selishte21_engl.htm The Gradeshnitsa Tablets]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, these tablets were the subject of attention in Bulgarian media due to claims made by Stephen Guide, a [[Bulgarian American]] of the Institute of Transcendent Analysis, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[California]], who claimed he had deciphered the tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.institutet-science.com/en/gradeshnitzae.php |title=The Votive Tablet from the village of Gradeshnitsa (Vratsa District, Bulgaria) |publisher=Institute of Transcendent Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2006/05/22/643264_reading-room-decoding-thracian-history-the-symbols-of-a-primitive-people |title=READING ROOM: Decoding Thracian history: The symbols of a primitive people |date=May 22, 2006 |last=Enright |first=Andrea |work=[[The Sofia Echo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standartnews.com/archive/2006/03/30/english/arts/index.htm Subchev, Konstantin.

Thursday 30 March 2006.] "Stephan Gide who arrived from the USA to disclose sensational details about the ancient Thracian writing created a scandal in Bulgaria. The scientist, who claims to be an expert in linguistics, cryptography and transcendental analysis, announced that he had deciphered the inscriptions on an ancient tablet found in Gradeshnitsa. Scientists from the Bulgarian Academy of Science are explicit that Gide is an impostor, who has written his book on the basis of earlier discoveries filling the blanks with forfeited proofs. The real name of Gide is Gaidarski and, according to well informed sources, he is a spiritual leader of a religious cult defending a doctrine, which is a weird combination of Christian and ancient Orphistic beliefs."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intelsat IV F-7''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-312]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IV F-7 was part of the Intelsat IV series which consisted of eight communications satellites, launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] during the early 1970s, marked the fifth generation of [[geostationary]] communications satellites developed by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] since 1963 with the launch of Syncom II, the world's first synchronous satellite. The [[Syncom]] II was 15 cm high and 28 inches in diameter, weighing 78 pounds in orbit. In contrast, the Intelsat IVs weighed more than [[Pound (mass)|£]] 1,300 (595 kg) into orbit and were more than 17 feet (5.31 meters) in [[diameter]]. All seven satellites exceeded their projected life expectancies and were withdrawn from active duty, the last of which, the [[Intelsat IV F-1]] was retired in October 1987.

The satellite was equipped with 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s. It had 6,000 two-way [[relay]] phone calls or broadcast 12 concurrent color television programs or mixed combinations of communications traffic including data and fax.

The satellite had 12 channels of broadband communication. Each channel had a bandwidth of 40 MHz and provided about 500 communication circuits.

== Release ==
The satellite was successfully launched into space on August 23, 1973, at 23:57:02 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,414&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Inter-Allied Victory Medal''' ({{lang-el|Διασυμμαχικόν Μετάλλιον Νίκης}}) is a campaign medal issued by [[Greece]], commemorating the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victory in the [[World War I|First World War]]. The medal is the Greek version of a common design used among all Allied nations, following a proposal made by French Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], who was supreme commander of the Allied Forces during the war. Each medal, in bronze, has the same diameter (36&amp;nbsp;mm) and ribbon (double rainbow), but with a national design representing a winged [[Victory]]. 
The Greek version of the medal was designed by [[Henry-Eugène Nocq]]. Approximately 200,000 medals were awarded.

"'''Je ne sais quoi'''" is an [[Iceland]]ic dancepop song composed by [[Örlygur Smári]] and [[Hera Björk]] and performed by Hera Björk, and was the Icelandic entry at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]], held in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]] on 25, 27 and 29 May 2010. The performance took place in the first semi-final on 25 May and was performed again in the final, four days later. The song is performed in [[English language|English]] with some phrases in [[French language|French]] (namely the phrases "Je ne sais quoi," ''I don't know what'', and "Je ne sais pas pourquoi," ''I don't know why''). "Je ne sais quoi" was the winner of the [[Iceland in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|Söngvakeppni Sjónvarpsins 2010]] contest, organised by Icelandic broadcaster [[RÚV|Ríkisútvarpið]] (RÚV) to select the Icelandic entry for the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=8733&amp;_t=Iceland%3A+Hera+Bj%C3%B6rk+to+Oslo!|title=Iceland: Hera Björk to Oslo!|last=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1681">'''Kenas-unarpe''' (ケナㇱウナㇻペ) is an [[Ainu people|Ainu]] ''[[kamuy]]'' (''god'').  She is a blood-drinking monster who preys upon hunters.  However, she is sometimes called upon to assist in childbearing.

==Mythology==
Kenas-unarpe is said to have emerged from the decomposing tools the gods had used in their making of the earth. She is a monster with a thirst for human blood, and a sister to various poisons and diseases.

She often takes on the appearance of [[Hasinaw-uk-kamuy]], the goddess of the hunt, in order to deceive hunters. She employs this trick to lead a hunter deep into a swamp; when he tires, she turns on him, killing him and drinking his blood. Her likeness to Hasinaw-uk-kamuy is not perfect, however, and she is forced to conceal her face with her long hair.  By this, a wary hunter can recognize Kenas-unarpe and avoid this fate.

Kenas-unarpe's association with blood makes her important in childbearing.  She is sometimes invoked to deal with the pollution of pregnant women by blood or disease, and myths hold that she is a very powerful, though potentially dangerous, counterforce in such cases.&lt;ref name="ash"&gt;Ashkenazy, Michael.

The monastery has two churches, one built partly in a [[cave]] and dedicated to the Archangel Gabriel, the other, added later, dedicated to [[St. Nicholas]].

The monastery was founded in the 12th century. The first written reference to it is in 1606, in the "''Kruševačkom Pomeniku''". It was rebuilt in 1644 by Archbishop Gavrilo (Rašković). Records from 1733 mention it as an educational establishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ivanjica.gov.rs/|title= Official website of municipality of Ivanjica|accessdate=9 May 2014 |work= |publisher= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[hegumen]] of the monastery is the young [[Serbian Orthodox]] Hieromonk Amvrosije. He lives there by himself with his tamed animals of two wolves, a fox, an eagle, a snake, raven, rabbit and an owl. The Serb-American community of [[Libertyville, Illinois|Libertyville]] have donated a motorcycle and 4-wheel-drive to the monastery. The life of the monastery has been documented in the Serbian documentary "Monah i vuk".

==Architecture==
The monastery consists of two temples: the first is dedicated to the Holy [[Archangel Gabriel]] and another, that was later built, is dedicated to [[St. Nicholas]]. Church of the Holy Archangel partially rests on the rock, so it can be classified in a group of ascetic cave churches. It is a single building with [[altar]] niche. It is believed to have been built in the late 12th or the early 13th century, judging by the remains of frescoes and traditions.

Another temple has a rectangular base and a [[dome]]. From frescoes dating from the 13th century, which have survived only in fragments, characters of saints are still well preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ivatourism.org/|title= Tourist organisation of Ivanjica |accessdate=9 May 2014 |work= |publisher= |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
During the year 1644, Metropolitan of Raska, Gavrilo(Rašković), visits the monastery and finds it extremely neglected, in serious condition. Then he restores it and stays in it for a while, and in 1651 he endows the Monastery with a shackled and decorated Holy Gospel for the liturgical needs of the restored church of St. Nicholas, and frees the monastery land, which was returned to the [[monastery]].

From the records of 1733,we find that a spiritualist Filip lives in the monastery, who taught those who wanted to become priests. From all this, the monastery was highly ranked as an important place in both spiritual, as well as in national and political life of the people of this region. One of the oldest schools in [[Serbia]] was open here in 1867. There was also a school for future priests. Since 1813, the monastery performed an active function of a regular parochial school.

The monastery was restored in 2005, and the monastery refectory was built during 2007–2009.

'''Los Cabos International Airport''' {{Airport codes|SJD|MMSD}}  is the [[List of the busiest airports in Mexico|sixth-busiest airport in Mexico]], located at [[San José del Cabo]] in [[Los Cabos Municipality]], [[Baja California Sur]] state, [[Mexico]].

The airport serves [[San José del Cabo]], [[Cabo San Lucas]], and the [[Los Cabos Municipality|Los Cabos area]].

==History==
From September 2011 until January 2012, the airport temporarily gained nonstop service to [[Asia]] with flights to [[Shanghai]], [[China]].

The airport handled 4,248,000 passengers in 2016, and 4,909,700 in 2017. It has become the most important airport in the state of [[Baja California Sur]]. Because of a dramatic increase in the number of holiday resorts and due to the region's fast population growth, the infrastructure of the airport is now insufficient compared to the increasing demand, causing a lack of available positions for aircraft during peak-hours, as in many other airports in Mexico.

On September 15, 2014, Los Cabos International Airport was badly damaged by [[Hurricane Odile (2014)|Hurricane Odile]]. Planes were knocked against structures due to the winds from Odile. Many people went to the airport, demanding flights out of Cabo San Lucas. The [[Politics of Mexico|Mexican government]] began airlifting the first of thousands of stranded tourists, free of charge, to airports in Tijuana, Mazatlan, Guadalajara and Mexico City to catch connecting flights and, in the case of foreigners, receive consular assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/16/hurricane-odile-mexico-airlifts-tourists-stranded |title=Hurricane Odile: Mexico begins airlifts of tourists stranded in Los Cabos |publisher=The Guardian |date=September 2014 |accessdate=January 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
The architect of Los Cabos International Airport's 1997 renovation and expansion was Mexican architect and great-grandson of [[Queen Isabella II]] of Spain, Manuel De Santiago-de Borbón González Bravo. He was a member of [[International Council on Monuments and Sites|ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites)]], and his lifetime architectural legacy to Mexico adds to {{convert|11000000|m2}} built nationwide, including famous buildings and national sites, as well as important national restorations like the Mexican Houses of Congress Palace ([[Palacio Legislativo de San Lázaro]]).

==Terminals==

The '''Republic of Lakotah''' or '''Lakotah''' is a [[List of active separatist movements in North America#United States|proposed independent republic]] in North America for the [[Lakota people]] and other people. Proposed by activist [[Russell Means]], the suggested territory would be enclaved by the borders of the [[United States]], covering thousands of square miles in [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Nebraska]], [[Wyoming]], and [[Montana]]. These proposed borders are those of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie]] between the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] and the [[Lakota people|Lakota]]. These lands are now occupied by [[Indian reservation]]s and non-Native settlements. None of the existing Lakota tribal governments support the proposed republic, and they were not consulted about the proposal.&lt;ref name=toensing&gt;{{cite news |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2008/01/04/withdrawal-us-treaties-enjoys-little-support-tribal-leaders-79806 |title=Withdrawal from US treaties enjoys little support from tribal leaders |author=Gale Courey Toensing |publisher=[[Indian Country Today]] |date=2008-01-04 |accessdate=2016-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504091145/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2008/01/04/withdrawal-us-treaties-enjoys-little-support-tribal-leaders-79806 |archive-date=2016-05-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cos&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/12/23/425848/- ''Lakota Sioux Have NOT Withdrawn From the US]''; in [[The Daily Kos]]; December 23, 2007; accessed March 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Four [[activism|activists]], calling themselves the Lakota Freedom Delegation, traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]], on December 17, 2007, and delivered a [[Wikisource:Republic of Lakotah declaration of independence|statement]] declaring that they were, "withdrawing from the treaties their ancestors signed with the U.S." and "setting up their own independent nation." Reasons cited included that "the federal government has failed to abide by 33 treaties that promised land, health care, education and other services." Their leader was [[Russell Means]], one of the prominent members of the [[American Indian Movement]] in the late 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name=indianz1&gt;{{cite web |url=
http://indianz.com/News/2007/006449.asp |title=Lakota Freedom Delegation withdraws from US |author= |publisher=indianz.com |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Lakota Freedom Delegation stated that they did not recognize [[tribal council|tribal governments]] or presidents as recognized by the United States [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], sometimes referring to these groups as "[[Collaborationism|stay-by-the-fort Indians]]".&lt;ref name=pullout&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kumeyaay.com/kumeyaay-news/news-archive/1576-delegates-announce-pullout-from-us-treaties.html |title=Delegates announce pullout from U.S. treaties |author=Jerry Reynolds |publisher=Indian Country Today |date=December 18, 2007 |accessdate=March 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nor did any tribal governments, elected by the tribal people themselves, recognize the Republic of Lakotah.&lt;ref name=toensing /&gt;

==Territory, demographics, and economics==
The proposed boundaries of Lakotah are the [[Yellowstone River]] to the north, the [[North Platte River]] to the south, the [[Missouri River]] to the east and an irregular line marking the west.&lt;ref name=map&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.republicoflakotah.com/map.html |title=Map |publisher=Republic of Lakotah |accessdate=2008-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105083334/http://www.republicoflakotah.com/map.html |archivedate=2008-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=map2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakotaoyate.com/about.html |title=About |publisher=Lakota Oyate |accessdate=2008-01-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115174839/http://www.lakotaoyate.com/about.html |archive-date=2008-01-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These borders coincide with those set by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|1851 Treaty of Fort Laramie]]:

{{Blockquote|The territory of the [[Sioux]] or Dahcotah Nation, commencing the mouth of the [[White Earth River (North Dakota)|White Earth River]], on the [[Missouri River]]; thence in a southwesterly direction to the forks of the [[Platte River]]; thence up the north fork of the Platte River to a point known as the [[Red Butte, Wyoming|Red Buts]], or where the road leaves the river; thence along the range of mountains known as the [[Black Hills]], to the head-waters of [[Heart River (North Dakota)|Heart River]]; thence down Heart River to its mouth; and thence down the Missouri River to the place of beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canku-luta.org/PineRidge/laramie_treaty.html |title=Treaty of Fort Laramie - 1851 |accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By these claims, the largest city in Lakotah is [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The boundaries also contain [[Rapid City, South Dakota]]; [[Mandan, North Dakota]]; [[Casper, Wyoming]]; [[Bellevue, Nebraska]]; and [[Mount Rushmore]].

In addition to containing all the Indian reservations of the Lakota people, the territory which the republic claims includes reservations inhabited by non-Lakota Siouan peoples (the [[Dakota people]] and their communities, the [[Winnebago Indian Reservation]] and the [[Omaha Indian Reservation]]), and part of one non-Sioux reservation (the [[Fort Berthold Indian Reservation]] in western North Dakota). Lakotah would also contain some of the [[Lowest-income counties in the United States|poorest counties in the United States]].

==Activities==
On January 1, 2008, the republic announced that it would file [[lien]]s on all U.S. government-held lands within their claimed borders;&lt;ref name=liens&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.republicoflakotah.com/docs/noticeofliens.pdf |title=Notice to All Foreign Governments and Private Owners of Real Estate within the Republic of Lakotah |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2008-01-02 |format=PDF |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411181415/http://www.republicoflakotah.com/docs/noticeofliens.pdf |archive-date=2008-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the first round of liens, in an unnamed county in South Dakota, were rejected.&lt;ref name=toensing /&gt;

Following this the group chose to concentrate on the [[Black Hills]].&lt;ref name=15janrelease&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indymedia.org/en/2008/01/899372.shtml |title=Republic of Lakotah focuses on Black Hills |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, Means announced that the Republic of Lakotah would be founding an all-Lakota "grand jury" to investigate corruption by U.S. government officials on the seven reservations in the republic's claimed territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=July 28, 2008 |publisher=Rapid City Journal |url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2008/07/28/news/local/doc488d2d87d0b09450038082.txt |accessdate=2008-07-28 |author=[[Andrea J. Cook]] |title=Republic of Lakotah investigating tribal corruption}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Means unsuccessfully ran for the presidency of the [[Oglala Sioux|Oglala Lakota]] several times; in the 2008 election he lost 1,918 to 2,277.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Rapid City Journal |url=http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/local/article_6fe9794b-d21e-5b05-a7e6-93dc28489d40.html |title=OST inauguration set for Friday |author=Heidi Bell Gease |date=December 2, 2008 |accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and government==
Citizenship in the proposed republic would be open to people of all [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and to any resident of the land Lakotah claims. The group said they planned to issue their own passports and driving licenses in the name of the proposed nation.&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |title=Sitting Bull's tribe declares independence |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/12/21/windian121.xml |author=Catherine Elsworth |date=2007-12-26 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=2007-12-31 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group proposed that the nation be organized as a confederation that would respect the [[libertarianism|libertarian]] principles of ''[[Posse comitatus (common law)|posse comitatus]]'' and ''[[caveat emptor]]'', would offer "individual liberty through community rule," and would collect no nationwide taxes. However, individual communities within the proposed nation would be allowed to levy taxes with the consent of the taxed. [[Russell Means]] suggested that the proposed nation should not use [[fiat currency]] but instead adopt a [[gold standard]].&lt;ref name=toensing /&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;[http://www.freetalklive.com/files/means.mp3 Russell Means interview] from December 26, 2007 on [[Free Talk Live]]&lt;/ref&gt; Means has stated that this system of government is derived from the traditional Lakota government system.&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;&lt;ref name=Argus /&gt; Means said, "we are going to implement how we lived prior to [[European colonization of the Americas|the Invasion]]. Each community will be a mini-state unto itself ...

The four signatories of the Lakota Freedom Delegation's letter to the [[United States Department of State]] that announced withdrawal from the U.S. identified themselves by the title of "[[Big man (anthropology)|Itacan]] of Lakota" in a press release.&lt;ref name=releae&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2007/1220-02.htm |title=Freedom!

The following people identified themselves as members of the provisional government of Lakotah:

* Phyllis Young, provisional government member&lt;ref name=tegheyareport /&gt;

The [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Lakotah was not announced. The Republic of Lakotah gave its provisional capital as [[Porcupine, South Dakota]] with hopes in the long run to move administration to near [[Rapid City, South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republicoflakotah.com/FAQ.html |title=FAQ |publisher=Republic of Lakotah |accessdate=2008-01-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110144957/http://www.republicoflakotah.com/FAQ.html |archivedate=2008-01-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections with other movements==

[[Russell Means]] and [[Robert Robideau]] were both prominent in the [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM), and later in [[American Indian Movement#Ideological differences within AIM|AIM Autonomous]], with Means along with Tegheya Kte having taken part in the [[Wounded Knee incident]] and Robideau acquitted in a trial related to the [[Leonard Peltier#Aftermath|Leonard Peltier case]]. Tegheya Kte, meanwhile, led the [[Spotted Elk|Big Foot]] Riders in 2007,&lt;ref name=bigfootriders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/news2007/1227-03.htm |title=Chief Big Foot Riders Return To Wounded Knee, "We Want To Be Free" |date=December 27, 2007 |publisher=commondreams.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Phyllis Young is one of the founders of [[Women of All Red Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Josephy |first=Alvin M. |author2=Joane Nagel |author3=Troy R.

==Assertion of independence==
The Lakota Freedom Delegation traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]] and contacted the State Department, announcing that the Lakota were unilaterally withdrawing from the several treaties with the United States government. The delegation presented a letter, dated December 17, 2007 and signed by longtime Indian activists [[Russell Means]], Garry Rowland, Duane Martin Sr. (aka ''Canupa Gluha Mani''), and Phyllis Young, which declared the Lakota to be "predecessor sovereign of [[Dakota Territory]]" and cited gross violations of the treaties between the Lakota and the United States as the immediate cause for withdrawal. The letter also invited the United States government to enter into negotiations with the newly declared entity, there identified only as "Lakotah". It threatened that if good-faith negotiations were not begun then "Lakotah will begin to administer [[lien]]s against [[real estate]] transactions within the five state area of Lakotah."&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.republicoflakotah.com/2009/2007-lakotah-unilateral-withdrawal/ |title=Lakotah Unilateral Withdrawal from All Agreements and Treaties with the United States of America |date=2007-12-17 |publisher=Lakota Freedom Delegation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also has pursued international recognition for Lakotah at the embassies of [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Chile]], and [[South Africa]] and has claimed that [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[East Timor]] are "very interested" in Lakotah's declaration and that they expect recognition from [[Russia]]. Russell Means has made reference to [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]] as well.&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2007/12/20/news/local/doc476a99630633e335271152.txt |title=Lakota Sioux Secede From US, Declare Independence |author=Bill Harlan |publisher=[[Rapid City Journal]] |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2007-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823081033/http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/articles/2007/12/20/news/local/doc476a99630633e335271152.txt |archivedate=2009-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis for independence==
[[File:Sioux01.png|right|thumb|Traditional range of the Siouan peoples (dark green) and the current reservations (orange).]]

Supporters of Lakotah argue that their assertion of sovereignty is entirely legal under "[[Natural law|Natural]], [[International law|International]] and [[United States law]]".&lt;ref name=media&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.republicoflakotah.com/media.htm |title=Media |publisher=Republic of Lakotah |accessdate=2007-12-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group emphasizes that the Republic's establishment comes from a "withdrawal" from the United States, not a [[secession]].&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;&lt;ref name=interview /&gt;

They argue that as an Indian tribe in the United States, the Lakota people were already and always have been a sovereign nation as guaranteed under [[Article Six of the United States Constitution]], bound to the United States Federal Government by treaty. As such, the legal basis of such a state's independence is argued to be the Lakota nation's withdrawal from the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1851)|1851]] and [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|1868]] Treaties of [[Fort Laramie]], and the rejection of all United States federal laws, [[Executive order (United States)|executive order]]s, and other government acts since then, in particular rejecting the [[Major Crimes Act]], the [[Dawes Act|General Allotment Act]], the [[Indian Citizenship Act of 1924|Citizenship Act of 1924]], the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934, the [[Indian Claims Commission Act]], [[Public Law 280]] and the [[Termination Act]].&lt;ref name=youtube /&gt;&lt;ref name=declaration /&gt;

The group claims its authority to assert independence derives from a long period of discussion and preparation involving a number of traditional [[Tribal chief|chief]]s and [[tribal council]]s representing the following Indian reservations and communities:
*[[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]
*[[Porcupine, South Dakota]]
*[[Kyle, South Dakota]]
*[[Rosebud Indian Reservation]]
*[[Lower Brule Indian Reservation]]
*[[Cheyenne River Indian Reservation]]
*[[Standing Rock Indian Reservation]]
*[[Flandreau Indian Reservation]]&lt;ref name=oyatehistory&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakotaoyate.net/history.html |title=History |publisher=Lakota Oyate |accessdate=2008-01-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313161731/http://www.lakotaoyate.net/history.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also claims the right to withdraw, on behalf of the Lakota people, from the Treaties of Fort Laramie as a consequence of the [[Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties]] and the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]].  Members argue that the decision in the case of ''[[Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock]]'', [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 187|187 U.S. 553 (1903)]] shows that the United States Government does not adequately protect Indian rights.&lt;ref name=letter /&gt; Means also cites the [[Enabling Act of 1889]], stating that clauses protecting Indian sovereignty on the lands comprising the states where the Lakota historically reside have been ignored.&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;

In a 15 January 2008 news release, the Republic of Lakotah proposed that independence from the United States might follow a [[Compact of Free Association]] and suggested that the independence process could resemble that of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Philippines]], [[Palau]], the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] or the [[Marshall Islands]].&lt;ref name=15janrelease /&gt;

Russell Means also stated that he intended to treat the result of the 2008 Pine Ridge Reservation Presidential election, in which he was a candidate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.russellmeansfreedom.com/ |title=Russell Means for President of Pine Ridge Sioux Indian Reservation |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a "[[plebiscite]]/[[referendum]]" on Lakota independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite podcast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7SYMGyWdDk |title=Russell Means Freedom Part 1 |website=[[YouTube]] |host=[[Russell Means]] |date=April 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations for independence==
Lakotah's founders cite the [[Oglala Sioux|Oglala]] 1974 Declaration of Continuing Independence:

{{Blockquote|The United States of America has continually violated the independent Native Peoples of this continent by Executive action, Legislative fiat and Judicial decision. By its actions, the U.S. has denied all Native people their International Treaty rights, Treaty lands and basic human rights of freedom and sovereignty. This same U.S. Government, which fought to throw off the yoke of oppression and gain its own independence, has now reversed its role and become the oppressor of sovereign Native people.&lt;ref name=declaration&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.treatycouncil.org/PDFs/DECLARATION_OF_CONTINUING_INDEPENDENCE.pdf |title=Declaration of Continuing Independence by the First International Indian Treaty Council at Standing Rock Indian Country June 1974 |date=June 1974 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The groups cite several reasons for its assertion of sovereignty, all connected to what they refer to as the "[[Colonialism|colonial]] [[apartheid]]" of the reservation system in the United States. The group claims that control by the United States has led to massive unemployment, poverty and disease among the Lakota people and also alleges that 150 years of U.S. administration is responsible for the statistical poverty of Lakota lands. The group claims that withdrawal from the United States will reverse these problems, and help reestablish the [[Lakota language]] and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.republicoflakotah.com/why.htm |title=Why |publisher=Republic of Lakotah |accessdate=2007-12-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakotaoyate.net/why.html |title=Why |publisher=Lakota Oyate |accessdate=2008-01-03 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313155208/http://www.lakotaoyate.net/why.html |archivedate=2008-03-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group also claims persistent violations by the United States of their treaties with the Lakota.

[[File:Inyan-Kara.jpg|thumb|right|[[Inyan Kara Mountain|Inyan Kara]], in the [[Black Hills]] is a sacred mountain to the [[Lakota people|Lakota]].]]

Another longstanding point of contention between the Lakota and the United States is the status of the [[Black Hills]] of South Dakota, which were part of [[Sioux]] reservation lands until they were taken without compensation by the US government and opened for gold mining following the collapse of the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)]]. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court decision ''[[United States v. Sioux Nation of Indians]]'' awarded $105 million to eight tribes of Sioux Indians as compensation ($17.1 million for the market value of the land in 1877 and $88 million in 5% per annum simple interest between 1877 and 1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=448&amp;page=371 |title= UNITED STATES v.

==Reactions==
The extent of popular support among the Lakota people for independence is unclear. Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani have claimed that some 13,000 Lakota, including 77% of the population of Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, have shown support for the Republic of Lakotah, and that the eight-member delegation which traveled to Washington, D.C. was only a portion of some 77 tribal elders and activists taking part in the movement.&lt;ref name=headingright&gt;{{cite interview |url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/hrr/2007/12/22/Russell-Means- |date=2007-12-22 |accessdate=2008-01-05 |work=Heading Right |interviewer=Ed Morissey |last=Means |first=Russell |subjectlink=Russell Means |publisher=[[Blogtalkradio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=memes&gt;{{cite podcast |url=http://memes.org/audio-interview-canupa-gluha-mani-lakota-freedom-delegation |title=Interview with Canupa Gluha Mani - Lakota Freedom Delegation |date=2007-12-25 |host=Juxtaposeur |website=[http://memes.org Mind Viruses]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[Rapid City Journal]]'' reporter Bill Harlan reported on his [[blog]] that "most folks I talk to hadn't heard about the declaration. The ones who had heard the news, to a person, did not want to talk about it on the record."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/politicalblog/?p=2381 |title=Lakota Nation: no taxes! |author=Bill Harlan |publisher=Mount Blogmore, the ''[[Rapid City Journal]]'' Politlcal Blog |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-01-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Journal'' has also noted that "there were no tribal presidents in the group which made the announcement, no one from the top ranks of any of the Lakota Sioux tribes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rapidcityjournal.com/blogs/editor/?p=339 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713152917/http://rapidcityjournal.com/blogs/editor/?p=339 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-13 |author=Mikel LeFort |title=Lakota announcement: Where does it go? |publisher=Typos and Tribulations: Behind the headlines with a ''[[Rapid City Journal]]'' editor |date=2007-01-20 |accessdate=2008-01-01}} &lt;/ref&gt; Nanwica Kciji, an [[Oglala Lakota]] and first president of the Native American Journalists Association, has also discredited the December 2007 developments, arguing that the Lakotah Freedom Delegation "never considered that treaties are made between nations and not individuals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tim-giago/catering-to-that-10-perce_b_79241.html |title=Catering to That 10 Percent That Love to be Mascots |accessdate=2008-01-07 |author=Tim Giago |work=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alaskan Independence Party]], in an announcement dated December 21, 2007, "applauded" the independent Lakota nation and granted it "full recognition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akip.org/lakota.html |author=[[Lynette Clark]] |title=Alaskan Independence Party |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secessionist movement [[Second Vermont Republic]] has also announced its support, and encouraged other American Indian groups to similarly declare independence from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vermontrepublic.org/news_events/lakota_independence_resolution |title=Lakota Independence Resolution |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=2008-01-23 |publisher=[[Second Vermont Republic]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response from recognized Native American governments===
Rodney Bordeaux, chairman of the [[Brulé|Rosebud Sioux]], said that [[Rosebud Indian Reservation]] has no interest in joining the Republic of Lakotah and said that the Lakota Freedom Delegation never presented their plan to the tribal council.&lt;ref name=Argus&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.argusleader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071220/NEWS/712200347 |title=Lakota group pushes for new nation |author=Faith Bremner |publisher=[[Argus Leader]] |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2007-12-31}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bordeaux stated that the group does not represent the Lakota people nor the support of the elected tribal governments. However, he did say that Russell Means "made some good points".&lt;ref name=toensing /&gt;

Joseph Brings Plenty, chairman of the [[Cheyenne River Lakota]], agreed that the Lakota Freedom Delegation "are not representative of the nation I represent" but would not say whether he agreed or disagreed with their goals and message, noting some value in the group's actions in raising awareness for the history of the Lakota people.&lt;ref name=toensing /&gt;

===International response===
Internationally, according to Russell Means, [[Venezuela]]'s ambassador to the United States has stated to the group that his country cannot recognize Lakotah's independence based on Venezuela's interpretation of what the Lakotah Freedom Delegation is doing.&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;

In February 2008, the Lakotah Freedom Delegation (including Means) handed over a formal petition, asking for recognition of the Republic of Lakotah, to the embassies of [[Russia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bolivia]], [[Venezuela]], the [[Republic of South Africa]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], [[Nicaragua]], [[East Timor]], [[Chile]], [[Turkey]], [[India]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]] and [[Uruguay]]. The text of the petition is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.republicoflakotah.com/docs/Petition.pdf |title=untitled&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |access-date=2008-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411181412/http://www.republicoflakotah.com/docs/Petition.pdf |archive-date=2008-04-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. government response===
The [[United States Department of State]] referred queries on the subject of Lakotah to the [[United States Department of the Interior]], which oversees the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;"For your query, we will refer you to the Department of the Interior. This is not a State Department issue." [[Kirsten Petree]], Director, Office of Media Affairs, U.S. Department of State, private communication with [[wikinews:Lakota activists declare secession from US|Wikinews]] (December 21, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Garrison of the BIA said that the group's withdrawal "doesn't mean anything". "These are not legitimate tribal governments elected by the people ... when they begin the process of violating other people's rights, breaking the law, they're going to end up like all the other groups that have declared themselves independent — usually getting arrested and being put in jail."&lt;ref name=toensing/&gt;

Regarding the government response, or lack thereof, Russell Means stated that, "I don't expect the federal government to do anything. I don't believe they even know what to do."&lt;ref name=headingright /&gt;

==Origin==
Roots &amp; Shoots was founded in 1991, when Dr. Goodall started to give talks at local schools in [[Tanzania]]. A group of 12 of her students selected by their classmates met with her at her home to discuss their local environmental concerns and to figure out what they could do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jane Goodall’s Roots &amp; Shoots - The Jane Goodall Institute|url = http://www.janegoodall.org/what-we-do/roots-and-shoots/|website = The Jane Goodall Institute|accessdate = 2015-10-30|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These 12 students became the first members of Roots &amp; Shoots, and the organization grew from there. Of the original 12 students, one went on to serve as the minister of environment for Tanzania and another became the Roots &amp; Shoots' national director for Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Curricula==
{{ad|date=August 2018}}
The Roots &amp; Shoots curriculum is a learning program for teachers and other community leaders to use with students and young people to help them develop environmental, conservationist and humanitarian programs to improve their communities. Through service projects, students develop a sense of service and leadership in their own communities. The curriculums are split into elementary, middle and high school lesson plans. The program encourages young people to create projects that support campaigns. Roots &amp; Shoots provides resources about how to integrate these projects into the local community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; One major tenant of the Roots &amp; Shoots model is to use science and technology to map out community needs in order to find the places in a community where a campaign or service projects can help people, animals, or the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get Started! {{!}} Roots &amp; Shoots|url = http://www.rootsandshoots.org/content/get-started|website = www.rootsandshoots.org|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roots &amp; Shoots also uses technology to train club leaders through its massive open online course, Turning Learners into Leaders: Empowering Youth Through Service Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Roots &amp; Shoots Online Course {{!}} Roots &amp; Shoots|url = http://www.rootsandshoots.org/onlinecourse|website = www.rootsandshoots.org|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free professional development course provides community leaders with training on community mapping, fostering leadership in young people, collaborating with community stakeholders, and guiding young leaders towards practical solutions for community campaigns.

The '''Teduray ''' are a [[Philippines|Filipino]] ethnic group. They speak the [[Tiruray language]].

The Tiruray (Teduray) culture was studied at length in the 1960s by anthropologist Stuart A. Schlegel. Schlegel spent two years as a participant/observer among a group who lived in and was sustained by the rainforest. He was profoundly moved by the egalitarian society he witnessed, and went on to write several books and papers on the subject, including "Wisdom of the Rainforest: The Spiritual Journey of an Anthropologist."

==Indigenous religion==
The Teduray or Tiruray people believe in various spirits and deities. The most prominent deities are:
*Minaden – The goddess who creates of the world, had a brother named Tulus, also called Meketefu and Sualla.
*Tulus - Is the chief of all good spirits who bestow gifts and favors upon human beings. He goes around with a retinue of messengers called telaki. Tulus is said to have rectified some errors in the first creation of the world and of human beings.

'''Vesna Vulović''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Весна Вуловић}}; {{IPA-sr|ˈʋeːsna ˈʋuːlɔʋit͡ɕ|pron}}; 3 January 1950 {{en dash}} 23 December 2016) was a [[Serbia]]n flight attendant. She holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness]] [[world record]] for surviving the [[free fall#Surviving falls|highest fall without a parachute]]: {{convert|10,160|m}}. Her fall took place after an explosion tore through the baggage compartment of [[JAT Flight 367]] on 26 January 1972, causing it to crash near [[Srbská Kamenice]], [[Czechoslovakia]]. She was the sole survivor of the crash that air safety investigators attributed to a [[briefcase]] bomb. The Yugoslav authorities suspected that [[Croatian nationalist]]s were to blame, but no one was ever arrested.

Following the crash, Vulović spent days in a [[coma]] and was hospitalized for several months. She suffered a fractured skull, three broken [[vertebra]]e, two broken legs, broken ribs and a fractured [[pelvis]]. These injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. She made an almost complete recovery but continued to walk with a limp. Vulović maintained that she had no memory of the incident and thus had no qualms about flying in the aftermath of the crash. Despite her willingness to resume working as a flight attendant, [[Jat Airways|JAT Yugoslav Airlines]] decided to give her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. The airline felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity. Vulović became a celebrity in Yugoslavia and was deemed a national hero.

In 1985, The Guinness Book of World Records recognized Vulović as the world record holder for surviving the highest fall without a parachute. She was fired from JAT in the early 1990s after taking part in anti-government protests but avoided arrest because the government was concerned about the negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring. She continued her work as a pro-democracy activist until the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] was ousted from power during the [[Bulldozer Revolution]] of October 2000. Vulović later campaigned on behalf of the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]], advocating Serbia's entry into the [[European Union]]. The final years of her life were spent in seclusion and she struggled with [[survivor's guilt]]. Having divorced, she lived alone in her Belgrade apartment on a small pension until her death in 2016.

==Early life==
Vesna Vulović was born in [[Belgrade]] on 3 January 1950.&lt;ref name="Sandomir"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|newspaper=The New York Times|title=Vesna Vulovic, Flight Attendant Who Survived Jetliner Blast, Dies at 66|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/world/europe/vesna-vulovic-died-flight-attendant-in-plunge.html|date=28 December 2016|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|title=Vesna Vulovic, air stewardess who survived a plane crash&amp;nbsp;– obituary|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2017/01/03/vesna-vulovic-air-stewardess-survived-plane-crash-obituary/|subscription=yes|date=3 January 2017|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was a businessman and her mother was a fitness instructor.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; Driven by her love of [[The Beatles]], Vulović traveled to the United Kingdom after completing her first year of university, hoping to improve her English-language skills. "I initially stayed with my parent's friends in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]," she recalled, "but wanted to move to London. It was there that I met up with a friend who suggested we go to Stockholm. When I told my parents I was living in the Swedish capital, they thought of the drugs and the sex and told me to come home at once." Upon returning to Belgrade, Vulović decided to become a flight attendant after seeing one of her friends in a flight attendant's uniform. "She looked so nice and had just been to London for the day," Vulović recalled. "I thought, 'Why shouldn't I be an air hostess? I could go to London once a month'." She joined [[Jat Airways|JAT]], Yugoslavia's national [[flag carrier]] and largest [[airline]], in 1971.&lt;ref name="Avsec"&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Aviation Security Magazine|title=Vesna Vulovic: How to survive a bombing at 33,000 feet|url=http://www.avsec.com/vesna_vulovic__how_to_survive_a_bombing_at_33000_feet/|date=April 2002|accessdate=9 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810012910/http://www.avsec.com/vesna_vulovic__how_to_survive_a_bombing_at_33000_feet/|archive-date=10 August 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew had the entire afternoon and the following morning to themselves. Vulović wished to go sightseeing but her colleagues insisted that they go shopping. "Everybody wanted to buy something for his or her family," she recalled. "So I had to go shopping with them. They seemed to know that they would die. They didn't talk about it, but I saw&amp;nbsp;... I felt for them. And the captain was locked in his room for 24 hours. He didn't want to go out at all. In the morning, during breakfast, the co-pilot was talking about his son and daughter as if nobody else had a son or daughter."&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;

Flight 367 departed from [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport]] at 1:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 26 January. The aircraft, a [[McDonnell Douglas DC-9]], landed at [[Copenhagen Airport]] at 2:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., where it was taken over by Vulović and her colleagues.&lt;ref name="Zpráva"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Zpráva vydaná komisí Federálního ministerstva dopravy ČCSR|title=Souhrnná Zpráva|language=Czech|url=http://www.nacr.cz/Z-files/znasichfondu_II_1.pdf|date=19 June 1972|accessdate=9 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ScpC2jtb?url=http://www.nacr.cz/Z-files/znasichfondu_II_1.pdf|archivedate=16 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As it was late, we were in the terminal and saw it park," Vulović said. "I saw all the passengers and crew deplane. One man seemed terribly annoyed. It was not only me that noticed him either. Other crew members saw him, as did the station manager in Copenhagen.

Her turquoise uniform was covered in blood and her {{convert|3|in|adj=on}} [[stiletto heel]]s had been torn off by the force of the impact.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; Honke had been a medic during [[World War II]] and was able to keep her alive until rescuers arrived at the scene.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Colin|year=2010|title=Projectile Dynamics in Sport: Principles and Applications|publisher=Routledge|location=London, England|isbn=978-1-13402-762-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K218AgAAQBAJ|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paralysis and recovery==
Following the crash, Vulović spent days in a [[coma]], having fractured her skull and then [[hemorrhage]]d.{{efn|The length of time that Vulović was comatose is the subject of considerable contradiction, with different sources indicating three days,&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; ten days,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; and 27 days.&lt;ref name="White"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guinness"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Guinness World Records|title=Highest fall survived without parachute|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/highest-fall-survived-without-parachute/|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report issued by the Yugoslav state-owned news agency ''[[Tanjug]]'' in early February 1972 states that "[Vulović has] emerged from her coma&amp;nbsp;... is able to speak and read and is chatting in English with her doctors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Irish Times|title=Girl who fell 31,000 feet will survive|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/stewardess-survives-31-000-foot-fall-a-weasel-funeral-and-a-tax-on-gramophones-1.701331|date=2 February 1972|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} She also suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt; Her [[pelvis]] was fractured and several ribs broken.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total [[amnesia]] from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt; The last thing that Vulović could remember from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; The next thing she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;

Vulović underwent treatment in a [[Prague]] hospital until 12 March 1972, after which she was flown to Belgrade. She was offered a [[hypnotic]] injection to help her sleep during the flight back to Yugoslavia, but declined, explaining that she was not afraid of flying because she had no memory of the crash. In Belgrade, Vulović's hospital room was placed under 24-hour police protection because the authorities feared that the perpetrators of the bombing would want to kill her. The guards changed shifts every six hours, and no one was allowed in to see her except for her parents and doctors. Her hospitalization in Belgrade lasted until June 1972, after which she travelled to Montenegro to recuperate at a seaside resort, where her doctors visited her every two or three days. Vulović underwent several operations to restore her movement. At first, she could only move her left leg, and one month thereafter, she was once again able to move her right.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt; Vulović's parents had to sell both of their cars to pay for her medical bills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veselinović|first=S.|publisher=Radio Television of Serbia|title=Sreća pobedila nesreću|language=Serbo-Croatian|url=http://www.yugopapir.com/2014/07/vesna-vulovic-i-njena-cicka-ljubimice.html|date=April 1973|accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within ten months of her fall, Vulović had regained the ability to walk, but continued to limp for the rest of her life, her spine permanently twisted.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; In total, she spent 16 months recuperating.&lt;ref name="Guinness"/&gt; "Nobody ever expected me to live this long," she recounted in 2008.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; Vulović attributed her recovery to her "Serbian stubbornness" and "a childhood diet that included chocolate, spinach, and fish oil."&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Ruth|publisher=Slate|title=Bask in the Bracing Unsentimentality of Vesna Vulovic, the Only Person to Survive a 1972 Plane Crash|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/12/29/bask_in_the_bracing_unsentimentality_of_vesna_vulovic_the_only_person_to.html|date=29 December 2016|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air safety investigators attributed Vulović's survival to her being trapped by a food cart in the DC-9's [[fuselage]] as it broke away from the rest of the aircraft and plummeted towards the ground. When the cabin [[uncontrolled decompression|depressurized]], the passengers and other flight crew were blown out of the aircraft and fell to their deaths. Investigators believed that the fuselage, with Vulović pinned inside, landed at an angle in a heavily wooded and snow-covered mountainside, which cushioned the impact.&lt;ref name="Sandomir"/&gt;{{efn|On the basis of her conversations with Honke, Vulović disputed the assertion that she was discovered ab[[aft]] the DC-9, as claimed in some reports. "The man who found me&amp;nbsp;... told me that I was in the middle part of the plane," she said. "I was found with my head down and my colleague on top of me. One part of my body with my leg was in the plane and my head was out of the plane. A catering trolley was pinned against my spine and kept me in the plane."&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;}} Vulović's physicians concluded that her history of [[low blood pressure]] caused her to pass out quickly after the cabin depressurized and kept her heart from bursting on impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Inquisitr|title=Vesna Vulovic: Flight Attendant Who Survived Mid-Air Explosion and 33,000-foot Fall, Dies at 66|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/3835735/vesna-vulovic-dies/|date=29 December 2016|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vulović said that she was aware of her low blood pressure before applying to become a flight attendant and knew that it would result in her failing her medical examination, but she drank an exorbitant amount of coffee beforehand and was accepted.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;

===Fame===
[[File:Srbská Kamenice, pomník.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Monument in [[Srbská Kamenice]] memorializing the crash]]
In September 1972, Vulović expressed willingness to resume working as a flight attendant.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt; The airline felt that her presence on flights would attract too much publicity and instead gave her a desk job negotiating freight contracts. In Yugoslavia, Vulović was celebrated as a national hero.&lt;ref name="Sandomir"/&gt; Her reputation as a "[[Cold War]] heroine" also extended to the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=CNN|title=Fate or fluke?

In the early 1990s, Vulović and her husband divorced.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;{{efn|According to ''Večernji list'', the couple divorced in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="VL"/&gt; In 2002, Vulović told ''Aviation Security Magazine'' that she and her husband divorced "ten years ago".&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;}} Vulović attributed the divorce to her [[chain smoking]], which her husband disapproved of.&lt;ref name="VL"/&gt; Around the same time,{{efn|Some sources suggest that Vulović's employment was terminated in 1990.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; According to ''Večernji list'', JAT terminated her employment in 1991.&lt;ref name="VL"/&gt;}} Vulović was fired from JAT for speaking out against Serbian statesman [[Slobodan Milošević]] and taking part in anti-government protests. She avoided arrest because the government was concerned about the negative publicity that her imprisonment would bring.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly"/&gt; In response to her activism, pro-Milošević [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]]s launched a smear campaign against her, claiming that Flight 367 had been shot down by a Czechoslovak [[surface-to-air missile]] and that she had fallen from a lesser height than previously believed.&lt;ref name="VL"/&gt; Vulović continued taking part in anti-government demonstrations throughout the 1990s. When Milošević and his [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] were ousted in the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|Bulldozer Revolution]] of October 2000, Vulović was among several celebrities who took to the balcony of [[Stari dvor|Belgrade's city hall]] to make victory addresses.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt; She later campaigned on behalf of the [[Democratic Party of Serbia]] and advocated for Serbia's entry into the [[European Union]], which she believed would bring economic prosperity.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt;

===Deteriorating health and death===
Vulović told reporters that she did not think of her fall every day, but admitted to struggling with [[survivor guilt|survivor's guilt]].&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; "Whenever I think of the accident, I have a prevailing, grave feeling of guilt for surviving it and I cry&amp;nbsp;...

She stated that her ordeal had turned her into an [[optimism|optimist]]. "If you can survive what I survived," she said, "you can survive anything."&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt;

In 2005, Vulović's fall was recreated by the American television program ''[[MythBusters]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Radio Television of Serbia|title=Preminula stjuardesa Vesna Vulović|language=Serbian|url=http://www.rts.rs/page/stories/sr/story/125/drustvo/2573007/preminula-vesna-vulovic.html|date=24 December 2016|accessdate=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Peter Hornung-Andersen and Pavel Theiner, two Prague-based journalists, claimed that Flight 367 had been mistaken for an enemy aircraft and shot down by the [[Czechoslovak Air Force]] at an altitude of {{convert|800|m}}.

"Life is so hard today."&lt;ref name="Zimonjic"/&gt; Vulović lamented that her mother and father may not have died prematurely had she not been aboard Flight 367, stating that the incident not only ruined her life, but also that of her parents.&lt;ref name="Avsec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Slate"/&gt; She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from [[Oprah Winfrey]] and the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Olsen|first=Camilla Westersø|publisher=DR Forsiden|title=Stewardesse overlevede fald på 10.000 meter|language=Danish|url=https://www.dr.dk/nyheder/udland/stewardesse-overlevede-fald-paa-10000-meter|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that she was "tired" of discussing her fall.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"/&gt; By the time she had reached her sixties, Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Homolová|first=Marie|publisher=OnaDnes.cz|title=Letuška Vesna spadla z nebe u Děčína|language=Czech|url=http://ona.idnes.cz/letuska-vesna-spadla-z-nebe-u-decina-d6n-/spolecnost.aspx?c=A070129_105334_ona_ony_jup|date=29 January 2007|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|Nigerian radio station|music competition|The Voice Nigeria}} 
The '''Voice of Nigeria''' or '''(VON)''' is the official [[international broadcasting]] station of [[Nigeria]].

==History==
Founded in 1961, the Voice of Nigeria began life as the External Service of the then Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation (now [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria]]). Then Prime Minister Sir [[Abubakar Tafawa Balewa]] commissioned the service.

The nation's growing commitment informed the need to have an external channel through which authoritative information about the African situation could be disseminated to the entire world. Even then, its transmission, using a 10 kW HF transmitter, was limited to West Africa for two hours daily in English and French. Broadcast hours increased to six in 1963 with the commissioning of five prototype RCA 100 kW transmitters.

In 1989, five Brown Boveri transmitters with antennae system were acquired. On January 5, 1990, VON became autonomous, and in 1996, three state-of-the-art 250 kW Thomcast AG transmitters were commissioned. This boosted VON's transmission to the entire world. The transmitting station is located on 40 hectares at [[Ipokodo]], [[Ikorodu]] in Lagos State. While the administrative headquarters is in Abuja, the Federal Capital, News and Programmes emanate from both the [[Lagos]] and [[Abuja]] studios. In 2012, VON commissioned another state of the art multi-billion naira transmitting station at Lugbe, Abuja.

'''Powers and Functions'''

According to the Act establishing Voice of Nigeria, the following are some of its powers and functions

(2) 	The Corporation shall ensure that its services reflect views of Nigeria as a Federation and give adequate expression to the culture, characteristics, affairs and opinions of Nigeria. 
(3) 	The Corporation shall ensure that news and programmes enhance Nigeria’s foreign policy and image.

==Vision==
“To become the international radio broadcasting station of first choice for anyone interested in Nigeria and Africa”.

==Mission==

“Reflecting Nigerian and African perspective in our broadcast, winning and sustaining the attention, respect and goodwill of listeners worldwide particularly Nigerians and Africans in the Diaspora and making Nigeria’s voice to be heard more positively in the shaping of our world”

The '''World Federalist Movement''' ('''WFM''') is a [[global citizens movement]] that advocates the establishment of a global federal system of strengthened and democratic global institutions subjected to the principles of subsidiarity, solidarity and democracy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wfm-igp.org/our-movement/history&lt;/ref&gt; Famous advocates of world federalism include [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Rosika Schwimmer]], [[Albert Camus]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Garry Davis]], [[Emery Reves]], [[Wendell Willkie]], [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], [[E. B. White]] and [[Lola Maverick Lloyd]]. The organization was created in 1947 by those concerned that the structure of the new [[United Nations]] was too similar to the [[League of Nations]] which had failed to prevent [[World War II]], both being loosely structured associations of sovereign nation-states, with few autonomous powers.

The World Federalist Movement has member and associate organizations around the world. The movement currently counts 30,000 to 50,000 supporters. Notably active world federalist organizations, as of 2018, exist in Australia, Argentina, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The World Federalist Council, in which active members from around the world meet once a year, is tasked with supporting the creation of new organizations where these do not yet exist.  

==History==
{{wikisourcepar|World Federalist Movement Statement of Purpose}}
{{wikisourcepar|Statutes of the World Federalist Movement}} In the aftermath of [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]], activists around the world were forming organizations bent on creating a new international system that could prevent another global war.

The first world federalist organization was founded in 1937 by two famous [[Feminist movement|feminists]], [[Pacifism|pacifists]], and [[Suffragists|female suffragists]]: [[Rosika Schwimmer]] and [[Lola Maverick Lloyd]]. In 1938, the [[Federal Union]] was organized in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/about/history/ | title=History of Federal Union | publisher=Federal Union | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., Federal Union (now: [[Association to Unite the Democracies]]) was established in 1939 calling for a federation of the Atlantic democracies. The Swiss Internationale Bewegung der Weltföderalisten-Schweiz
was created in Geneva in 1940. During World War II, anti-fascist resistance movements shared clandestinely circulated copies of [[Altiero Spinelli]]'s plan for [[European Union|European federation]] and global federation. Spinelli later became one of the founding fathers of the European Union. In 1945, the Committee to Frame a World Constitution convened at the University of Chicago and drafted a Constitution for the World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.lib.uchicago.edu/e/scrc/findingaids/view.php?eadid=ICU.SPCL.CFWC | title=Guide to the Committee to Frame a World Constitution Records 1945-1951 | publisher=The University of Chicago | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, five small world federalist organizations came together in [[Asheville, North Carolina]] and agreed to merge as the [[Citizens for Global Solutions|United World Federalists]].

These five groups had, in the previous year, met with representatives of fifteen others in [[Montreux]] to discuss creating a worldwide federalist organization. It was one year later, in August 1947, also in Montreux, that more than 51 organizations from 24 countries came together at the Conference of the World Movement for World Federal Government. The Conference concluded with the Montreux Declaration.

By its second congress in 1948 in [[Luxembourg]], the Movement consisted of 150,000 members of 19 nationalities and 50 member and affiliated organizations. The 350 participants in the Congress laid the groundwork for an association of parliamentarians for world government, which came into being in 1951.

Federalists had hoped that the anticipated UN review conference (under Article 109 of the UN Charter) in 1955 would move the UN further in the direction of a world federal system. Unfortunately, the lack of political will dissipated any interest in such a conference. Around 1965 however, the Movement had established offices near the United Nations, with American federalist Marion McVitty as the Movement's UN observer and advocate.

Federalists in this period focused on [[amendments to the United Nations Charter]] as a way forward. Most involved reforms to institutions such as a more representative Security Council, a World Court with compulsory jurisdiction and judicial review authority and a democratically elected General Assembly (or a world parliament). Federalists proposed a number of new institutions such as a commission on sustainable development, an international development authority, a standing peacekeeping corps and an [[international criminal court]].

The WFM International Secretariat is based in New York City, across from the headquarters of the United Nations, and hosts the Coalition for the International Criminal Court, the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect and serves as an steering committee member in the 1 For 7 Billion coalition. It has had Special Consultative Status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) since 1970 and is affiliated with the UN Department of Public Information (DPI) and a current board member of the Conference of NGOs (CONGO). The Institute for Global Policy (IGP), founded in 1983 by the World Federalist Movement, is a research and policy institute dedicated to the promotion of human security, international justice, the prevention of armed conflict and the protection of civilians. The Institute emphasizes the democratization of international and regional organizations and the development and global application of international law.  Most recently, WFM-IGP has been at the forefront of advocating for NGO access to international conferences and meetings.

==Member organizations==
WFM-IGP is composed of autonomous national and regional organizations organized by individual supporters in their respective countries. In applying to the governing Council for membership, organizations are asked to endorse the [[Wikisource:Statutes of the World Federalist Movement|WFM Statement of Purpose]] and to demonstrate a "capacity to contribute to the enhancement of public and political support" for the Movement's goals.

The World Federalist Movement has Member Organizations (MOs) and Associate Organizations around the world, including [[Citizens for Global Solutions]], [[Union of European Federalists]], [[World Federalist Movement-Canada]], [[The Universal Party]], and the World Federalist Movement of Japan. Others include [[Democratic World Federalists]], [[One World Trust]], [[Committee for a Democratic UN]], and the Ugandan World Federalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wfm-igp.org/members/wfm-organizations-map | title=Our Members Around The World | publisher=World Federalist Movement | accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFM umbrella organization also includes the [[Coalition for the International Criminal Court]] and the International Coalition for the Responsibility to Protect.

'''Éiníní''' is an [[Ireland|Irish]] [[lullaby]]. Like many [[folk song]]s, variations exist, but one version has lyrics as follows, compiled by [[Seán Og]] and [[Manus O Baoill]]:

&lt;pre&gt;
Éiníní, éiníní, codalaígí codalaígí
Éiníní, éiníní, codalaígí codalaígí 

curfá (chorus:

Codalaígí, codalaígí 
cois an chlaí amuigh, Cois an chlaí amuigh 
codalaígí, codalaígí
Cois an chlaí amuigh, cois an chlaí amuigh

An londubh is an fiach dubh,
téigí a chodladh, téigí a chodladh 
an chéirseach is an préachán, 
téigí a chodladh, téigí a chodladh

An spideog is an fhuiseog 
téigí a chodladh, téigí a chodladh 
an dreoilín is an smóilín,
téigí a chodladh, téigí a chodladh
&lt;/pre&gt;

On the [[Mudcat Café]] site at [http://www.mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=13126 Mudcat], one author "Áine" notes that her grandmother sung a different chorus.  Much of this, however, appears to be an attempt at a phonetic rendering of the above, the exception being the "socair sásta" line ("safe and happy").  Much of what's below is incorrect Irish (Ínionaí" is not an Irish word, and "cois an chlé mo" doesn't actually make sense, as it literally means "at the foot of the left/clay my"), but it does SOUND a good deal like the version above when read aloud, which is why it's assumed to be an attempted phonetic rendering rather than actual Irish words:

&lt;pre&gt;
Ínionaí, Ínionaí, codalaígí codalaígí
Ínionaí, Ínionaí, codalaígí codalaígí
Codalaígí, codalaígí, cois an chlé mo, cois an chlé mo
Codalaígí, codalaígí, socair sásta, socair sásta
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Translation==
The rough English translation of this song:

&lt;pre&gt;

Little birds, little birds, 
sleep, sleep
Little birds, little birds, 
sleep, sleep

CHORUS:

Sleep, sleep,
By the wall outside, by the wall outside
Sleep, sleep
By the wall outside, by the wall outside

The blackbird and the raven,
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
The she-blackbird and the crow,
Go to sleep, go to sleep

The robin and the lark,
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
The wren and the thrush,
Go to sleep, go to sleep


&lt;/pre&gt;
