In the early morning hours of December 9, 2007, 24-year-old Matthew John Murray (b. December 5, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;[http://murderpedia.org/male.M/m/murray-matthew-photos-1.htm http://murderpedia.org/male.M/m/murray-matthew-photos-1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; opened fire at the [[Youth With A Mission]] training center in [[Arvada, Colorado]], killing two and wounding two others before escaping. Later that afternoon, he attacked the [[New Life Church (Colorado Springs, Colorado)|New Life Church]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], with a number of firearms, killing two more people and injuring three before being shot by Jeanne Assam, a member of the church's safety team, who was carrying a licensed private firearm. Murray subsequently died from a gunshot wound to the head, which reports indicate was inflicted either by himself, or possibly by Assam.

==Shootings==
===Arvada missionary shooting===
Around 12:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. [[Mountain Time Zone|MST]] (07:30 UTC), following a Christmas banquet that had taken place earlier that night, Matthew Murray knocked on the door of the Youth With A Mission facility. Murray asked personnel in the youth center if he could stay overnight;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; when he was refused, Murray opened fire,&lt;ref name=apviafoxnews/&gt; killing Tiffany Johnson, the center's Director of Hospitality, and staff member Philip Crouse, as well as wounding Dan Griebenow in the neck&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; and Charlie Blanch in the leg.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

After the incident, the YWAM base evacuated its 80 people to the mountain campus in [[Black Hawk, Colorado|Black Hawk]], 45 of whom were in the building at the time of the shooting.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/09/colorado.shooting/index.html |title=Gunman kills 2 at missionary training center |date=December 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 9, 2007 |publisher=CNN |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIPdzR7?url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/09/colorado.shooting/index.html |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Local police quickly conducted a canine search of the surrounding area, searching for the shooter; they hoped that fresh snow would help them track the suspect, but were unable to locate him.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; A [[reverse 911]] call went out to residents of the neighborhood to let them know a shooting suspect might be in their area.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

===New Life Church shooting===
At about 1:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. MST (20:00 UTC), more than thirty minutes after the 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. sermon had ended at New Life Church, Murray opened fire in the church parking lot, shooting at the Works family as they entered their vehicle, causing the worst fatal consequences at New Life Church that day: the deaths of two of the Works' family's four daughters: Stephanie Works, 18, and Rachel Works, 16, as well as the near-death of their father, David Works, who was shot multiple times.

Church member and bystander Judy Purcell was wounded in the shoulder when attempting to enter her vehicle; she survived her injuries. Murray directed gunfire towards other vehicles during his shooting spree within the New Life Church parking lot, including narrowly missing church patron Christina Wilke after riddling her vehicle with a volley of bullets from his semi-automatic rifle, missing Wilke with his gunfire by approximately four inches. Murray then entered the building's main foyer where he wounded Larry Bourbonnais, as Bourbonnais was attempting to yell at Murray distract Murray from hurting others; Bourbonnais was minorly wounded in the forearm with shrapnel. At this point, church member Jeanne Assam, a private security guard working for New Life Church, who was herself a former [[Minneapolis Police Department]] law enforcement officer, opened fire upon Murray. The incident was fully witnessed by Larry Bourbonnais, who later  repeatedly conveyed to national news interests that, "It was the bravest thing I've ever seen." Assam later gave her testimony publicly, stating that she felt that she was spiritually called to serve on the security team for the church that morning, and that she had been personally fasting and praying in preparation due to a supernatural "calling from God." &lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|title=US church gunman killed himself |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7140409.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 12, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIOYGd9?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7140409.stm |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the official coroner's report states that Murray subsequently killed himself,&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; some reports indicate that Assam suspects that she was the one who potentially administered the fatal wound upon Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/jeanne-assam/|title=Church Key|author=Kim LaCapria|date=June 19, 2015|website=snopes.com|accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police themselves have not stated on-record whom they believe fired the fatal shot upon Murray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Guard saved untold lives, officials say | website=LA Times | date=December 11, 2007 | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/11/nation/na-shoot11 | accessdate=April 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the New Life Church shooting, Assam later stated that "God guided me and protected me [and I] did not think for a minute to run away."&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;&lt;ref name=koaa&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koaa.com/aaaa_more_local_news/x911469723 |title=Victims at New Life identified |date=December 9, 2007 |accessdate=December 9, 2007 |publisher=KOAA-TV |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIUCZaf?url=http://www.koaa.com/aaaa_more_local_news/x911469723 |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

On December 13, 2007, Murray's family issued a statement saying that it was "groping for answers" and issued an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.christiantoday.com/article/gunman-committed-suicide-as-family-apologises-for-shooting/3555.htm |title=Gunman committed suicide as family apologises for shooting |publisher=Au.christiantoday.com |date=December 13, 2007 |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIRmCr6?url=http://au.christiantoday.com/article/gunman-committed-suicide-as-family-apologises-for-shooting/3555.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pastor of the church stated that Assam shot Murray before he entered {{convert|50|ft}} inside the building, after she encountered him in the hallway, and that Assam probably saved "over 100 lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police: Same Gunman Attacked Both Churches |url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/14810359/detail.html |publisher=KMGH Denver |date=December 10, 2007 |accessdate=December 10, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIUu4Mm?url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/14810359/detail.html |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the shooting spree, [[Colorado Springs Police Department]] officers searched the church campus looking for suspicious devices. Colorado governor [[Bill Ritter (politician)|Bill Ritter]] ordered state authorities to help investigate. The [[FBI]] and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives]] also came to the site to assist.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

It was not immediately known whether the shootings were related to an earlier Arvada missionary shooting, {{convert|70|mi}} away. However, prior to the second shooting, police were already conducting an investigation at Murray's home.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt;

Police said the description of the gunman in the second shooting was similar to the first: a white male wearing a dark hat and dark jacket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7135729.stm ''Two US Christian centres attacked''].

On December 10, 2007, the gunman in both the YWAM Arvada and New Life Church shootings was identified as 24-year-old '''Matthew J. Murray''', one of two sons of a Colorado neurologist. Reportedly, Murray was homeschooled in a deeply religious Christian household, and he attended, but did not complete, a missionary training program at the YWAM Arvada facility in 2002.&lt;ref name=dp/&gt; Court records indicated that Murray was bitter over his expulsion from the 12-week missionary training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Kohler, Judith| title = Gunman in religious attacks had been thrown out of missionary school: police| agency = Associated Press| url = http://www.570news.com/news/international/article.jsp?content=w1210102A| date = December 10, 2007| accessdate = December 11, 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Merritt, George| title = Gunman may have warned of 2nd attack| agency = Associated Press| url = https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071211/ap_on_re_us/church_shootings| date = December 11, 2007| accessdate = December 11, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071213230455/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20071211/ap_on_re_us/church_shootings|archivedate = December 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His expulsion from the school was confirmed by Cheryl Morrison, whose husband, George Morrison, is pastor of the Faith Bible Chapel adjacent to YWAM Denver. She didn't know specifics of the conflict. ''"I don't think that ‘run-in’ is the word, but they did have to dismiss him. It had to be something of significance, because they go the nth degree with people."'' Murray was expelled from the school due to "strange behavior," which included playing perceived-frightening rock music and him claiming to hear voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Colorado gunman scared co-workers 5 years ago, one says' |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/10/shooter.youth/ |date=December 11, 2007 |accessdate=December 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIW9NEQ?url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/12/10/shooter.youth/ |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gathright |first=Alan |title=A gunman's bloody trail: from hate mail to mass murder |publisher=Rocky Mountain News |date=December 10, 2007 |url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/dec/10/cops-search-arapahoe-home/ |accessdate=December 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5whIWWUXq?url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/dec/10/cops-search-arapahoe-home/ |archivedate=February 22, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the second shooting, Murray left several violent and threatening messages on several religious websites, espousing his hatred for fundamental Christianity and his intentions on killing as many Christians as possible.

One message quoted Eric Harris  of the [[Columbine High School massacre]]; it read: ''"I'm coming for EVERYONE soon and I WILL be armed to the ...teeth and I WILL shoot to kill. ...God, I can't wait till I can kill you people. Feel no remorse, no sense of shame, I don't care if I live or die in the shoot-out. All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you ... as I can especially Christians who are to blame for most of the problems in the world."''&lt;ref name=9News&gt;Woodward, Paula, Jace Larson and Nicole Vap.

In another of his very last posts, made that morning to a [[Usenet]] [[newsgroup]],&lt;ref name="yourcolombine"&gt;Meyer, Jeremy P., David Migoya and Christopher N. Osher. [http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_7696043 "Your Colombine"]. ''The Denver Post''.

According to the chapter leader, Murray had attended their events for one or two years, but his request for membership was turned down&lt;ref name="twisted"&gt;Gorski, Eric. [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5japE3NYsSAjhnemSFfykd2W3JawwD8TG6K4O0 "Colorado Gunman Left Twisted Trail"]. Associated Press.

Matthew Murray was also baptized into [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) in late 2006, according to the church's records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dallof, Sarah |title='Colorado shooter was baptized into LDS faith' |publisher=KSL News |url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=2321651 |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=December 13, 2007 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wiHVXq8s?url=http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=2321651 |archivedate=February 23, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to investigators, Murray descended into extreme anti-Christian psychosis over a period of several months, and his web-postings became increasingly violent, despondent and hateful. Some of the users tried to counsel Murray and one psychologist, Dr. Marlene Winell, who is recognized as the first mental health professional to identify the condition of "Religious Trauma Syndrome," offered her services after reading his poem called "Crying all alone in pain in the nightmare of Christianity." Years later, Dr. Winell's one-time distant attempt to reach out to provide council to a young man (through a public posting via the Internet, her only way of communication with the unknown subject), whom she perceived and recognized as disturbed and unstable, was, years later, eventually revealed as James Holmes, who became the mass murderer responsible for Colorado's July 20, 2012 Aurora movie theater's "Batman movie" killings. The horrific event drew increased national attention to Dr. Winell's enlightening studies and began to further shed light on her studies into "Religious Trauma Syndrome" and it's potentially-harmful consequences upon society at large.

&lt;ref name=9News/&gt; After the killing, police found a letter addressed "To God," by Murray, in his car. The letter was listed as evidence and property, which invoiced items that Colorado Springs police recovered from a 1992 Toyota Camry belonging to Matthew Murray.

Al-Lahim was born in the deeply conservative [[Al-Qassim Province|Qassim]] region. Until the late 1990s, Al-Lahim, who holds a degree in sharia, was an Arabic teacher as well as an [[Islamist]], active in As-Sahwa al-Islamiyya. He is married and the father of two.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/22/AR2006122201579.html Saudi Lawyer Takes On Religious Court System]&lt;/ref&gt;

He became committed to civil rights while attending "Sharia school" in [[Imam Muhammad ibn Saud Islamic University]] in Riyadh.&lt;ref name="Washington Post, Dec. 23, 2006"/&gt; According to analysts of his work, Al-Lahim is effective because "He not only crafts effective legal arguments, but he also understands the conservative forces that hold the gavel."&lt;ref name="Nathaniel Rosenblatt 2008, p. 96"/&gt;

On 6 November 2004, Al-Lahim was arrested by Saudi authorities for defending three reform activists on trial in Saudi Arabia charged with "issuing statements and collecting as many signatures as possible on petitions" calling for reforms in the Kingdom as well as of calling for the adoption of a constitutional monarchy and "using Western terminology" in demanding political reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=54195&amp;d=9&amp;m=11&amp;y=2004 Reformists’ Lawyer Arrested After Letter Sent to Crown Prince by Raid Qusti for Arab News 9 November 2004 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090651/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=54195&amp;d=9&amp;m=11&amp;y=2004 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three activists and Al-Lahem were released in early August 2005 at the intervention of King Abdullah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68237&amp;d=10&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 Abdullah’s Noble Gesture Thanked 10 August 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716090703/http://archive.arabnews.com/?page=1&amp;section=0&amp;article=68237&amp;d=10&amp;m=8&amp;y=2005 |date=July 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''acoustic mirror''' is a passive device used to reflect and focus (concentrate) [[sound wave]]s. [[Parabolic reflector|Parabolic]] acoustic mirrors are widely used in [[parabolic microphone]]s to pick up sound from great distances, employed in surveillance and reporting of outdoor sporting events.  Pairs of large parabolic acoustic mirrors which function as "whisper galleries" are displayed in science museums to demonstrate sound focusing.

Between the World Wars, before the invention of [[radar]], parabolic sound mirrors were used experimentally as early-warning devices by military [[air defence]] forces to detect incoming enemy aircraft by listening for the sound of their engines.  During World War 2 on the coast of southern England, a network of large concrete acoustic mirrors was in the process of being built when the project was cancelled owing to the development of the [[Chain Home]] radar system.  Many of these mirrors are still standing today.

== Acoustic aircraft detection ==
[[Image:ListeningEars(PaulRusson)Mar2005.jpg|thumb|right|Acoustic mirrors at [[RAF Denge]]]]
Before World War II and the invention of [[radar]], acoustic mirrors were built as [[early warning]] devices around the coasts of Great Britain, with the aim of detecting incoming enemy aircraft by the sound of their engines.  The most famous of these devices still stand at [[RAF Denge|Denge]] on the [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] peninsula and at [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] in [[Kent]].  Other examples exist in other parts of Britain (including [[Sunderland, Tyne and Wear|Sunderland]], [[Redcar]], [[Boulby]], [[Kilnsea]] and [[Selsey Bill]]), and [[Baħar iċ-Ċagħaq]] in [[Malta]]. The Maltese sound mirror is known locally as "the ear" (il-Widna) and appears to be the only sound mirror built outside Great Britain.

The Dungeness mirrors, known colloquially as the "listening ears", consist of three large [[concrete]] reflectors built in the 1920s&amp;ndash;1930s.  Their experimental nature can be discerned by the different shapes of each of the three reflectors: one is a long curved wall about {{convert|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|70|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, while the other two are dish-shaped constructions approximately {{convert|4|-|5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter.  [[Microphone]]s placed at the [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] of the reflectors enabled a listener to detect the sound of aircraft far out over the [[English Channel]].  The reflectors are not parabolic, but are actually spherical mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

| accessdate=2010-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Spherical mirrors can be used for direction finding by moving the sensor rather than the mirror; another unusual example is the [[Arecibo Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arecibo-observatory.com The Arecibo Observatory - Past, Present and Future]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110427085001/http://arecibo-observatory.com/ |date=April 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acoustic mirrors had a limited effectiveness, and the increasing speed of aircraft in the 1930s meant that they would already be too close to engage by the time they had been detected.  The development of radar put an end to further experimentation with the technique. Nevertheless, there were long-lasting benefits.  The acoustic mirror programme, led by Dr [[William Sansome Tucker]], had given Britain the methodology to use interconnected stations to pinpoint the position of an enemy in the sky.  The system they developed for linking the stations and plotting aircraft movements was given to the early radar team and contributed to their success in World War II; although the British radar was less sophisticated than the German system, the British system was used more successfully.

==Modern uses==
[[Image:Whispering dish, Jodrell Bank.jpg |thumb|right|A parabolic whispering dish that's part of an installation at [[Jodrell Bank]] Observatory.]]
Parabolic acoustic mirrors called "whisper dishes" are used as participatory exhibits in science museums to demonstrate focusing of sound.  Examples are located at Bristol's [[We The Curious]], [[Ontario Science Centre]], Baltimore's [[Maryland Science Center]], Oklahoma City's [[Science Museum Oklahoma]], San Francisco's [[Exploratorium]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exhibits/l/listening_vessels.html Exploratorium ''Listening Vessels'' exhibit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807234329/http://www.exploratorium.edu/cmp/exhibits/l/listening_vessels.html |date=August 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Science Museum of Minnesota]], the [[Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago]], [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]], and [[Parkes Observatory]] in Australia.  A pair of dishes, typically {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, is installed facing each other, separated by around a hundred metres.  A person standing at the focus of one can hear another person speaking in a whisper at the focus of the other, despite the wide separation between them.

[[Parabolic microphone]]s depend on a parabolic dish to reflect sound coming from a specific direction into the microphone placed at the focus.  They are extremely directional: sensitive to sounds coming from a specific direction.  However, they generally have poor bass response because a dish small enough to be portable cannot focus long wavelengths.    Small portable parabolic microphones are used to record wildlife sounds such as birdsongs, in televised sports events to pick up the conversations of players, such as in the huddle during American Football games, or to record the sounds of the sport, and in audio [[surveillance]] to record speech without the knowledge of the speaker.

'''Ard Fheis''' or '''Ardfheis''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈɑːɾˠd̪ˠ ˈɛɕ}} "high assembly"; plural ''Ardfheiseanna'')  is the name used by many Irish [[political party|political parties]] for their annual [[party conference]]. The term was first used by [[Conradh na Gaeilge]], the [[Irish language]] cultural organisation, for its annual convention.

==Usage==
Among the parties who use the term ''Ardfheis'' are: 

*[[Fine Gael]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/fine-gael-ard-fheis/news/|title=8 things we learned at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis|first=Rónán|last=Duffy|work=[[TheJournal.ie]]|date=23 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/greenparty/docs/green_party_convention_2017_brochur|title=Green Party Convention 2017 Brochure|work=issuu|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Journey to Change 25 Years of the Green Party in Irish Politics|last=Boyle|first=Dan|publisher=Nonsuch Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-184588-559-5|location=|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Northern Ireland]], the term is not used by the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], or by those parties which are not Irish-nationalist in outlook, such as the [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]] and [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], [[Communist Party of Ireland|Communist Party]], [[Renua Ireland]] and the [[Social Democrats (Ireland)|Social Democrats]] do not use the term ''ardfheis''.

==Ard Chomhairle==
Many political parties who use the term Ardfheis, also use the term ''Ard Chomhairle'' which means National Executive Committee. It literally translates as ''High Council''.

==In Scotland==
*[[Scottish Republican Socialist Movement]]
*[[Siol nan Gaidheal]]

[[File:Association of Autonomous Astronauts (logo).png|thumb|AAA logo]]
The '''Association of Autonomous Astronauts''' is a worldwide network of community-based groups dedicated to building their own [[spaceships]]. The AAA was founded 23 April 1995. Although many of their activities were reported as serious participation in conferences or protests against the militarization of space, some were also considered art pranks, media pranks, or elaborate spoof.&lt;ref name="Gravity"&gt;{{cite web

The Association's ostensible five-year mission, a reference to ''[[Star Trek]]'', was to "establish a planetary network to end the monopoly of corporations, governments and the military over travel in space".&lt;ref name="Sztuka"/&gt; Artists who became involved were often connected to the [[zine|zine scene]] or [[mail art]] movements.&lt;ref name="Sztuka"/&gt; The five-year mission's completion was marked at the 2000 [[Fortean Times]] conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some chapters have continued activities to the present day. Several AAAers have experienced zero-gravity training flights.

The writer [[Tom Hodgkinson]] described participants as "a loose bunch of Marxists, futurists, and revolutionaries on the dole", going on to explicate their mission as "reclaim[ing] the idea of space travel for the common man". To the AAA, he said, "space travel represented an ideal of freedom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How To Be Idle|author=[[Tom Hodgkinson]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|year=2005|isbn=0-06-077968-3}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2006-01-03--&gt; Hodgkinson is editor of ''[[The Idler (1993)|The Idler]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Annick Bureaud of ''[[Leonardo Journal|Leonardo/OLATS]]'' viewed their work as "space art" that "combine[d] freely space, cyberspace, raves, esoteric things, techno-music, etc.", calling attention to "how they recycle ... key images (the MIR Space Station, the astronauts on the Moon, etc.) ... mixed with science-fiction (and specially Star Trek) buzz-words or images" and then subjected these "sacred icons" to "iconoclastic treatments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In his book ''Unleashing the Collective Phantoms,'' the theorist [[Brian Holmes]] said of the AAA: "The ideas sound fantastic, but the stakes are real: imagining a political subject within the virtual class, and therefore, within the economy of cultural production and intellectual property that had paralyzed the poetics of resistance." &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The London chapter participated in the J18 [[Carnival Against Capitalism]] protests during that year's [[G8]] summit, with a contingent of AAA members dressed in [[space suit]]s delivering a petition against the [[militarisation of space]] to the headquarters of [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Autonomous areas.svg|thumb|upright=1.25|Countries with at least one area labelled "autonomous" or defined as such by law]]

An '''autonomous administrative division''' (also referred to as an '''autonomous area''', '''entity''', '''unit''', '''region''', '''subdivision''', or '''territory''') is a [[administrative division|subdivision]] or [[dependent territory]] of a [[country]] that has a degree of [[self-governance]], or [[autonomy]], from an external authority. Typically, it is either geographically distinct from the rest of the country or populated by a [[Minority group|national minority]]. [[Decentralization]] of self-governing powers and functions to such divisions is a way for a national government to try to increase democratic participation or administrative efficiency or to defuse internal conflicts.  Countries that include autonomous areas may be [[federacy|federacies]], [[federation]]s, or [[confederation]]s.  Autonomous areas can be divided into [[Territory (country subdivision)|territorial]] autonomies, subregional territorial autonomies, and local autonomies.

==List of other entities considered autonomous==

=== Overseas territories ===

;British Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies
{{main article|2=British Overseas Territories|3=Crown dependencies|4=British Islands}}
[[Jersey]], [[Guernsey]], and the [[Isle of Man]] are self-governing [[Crown dependencies]] which are not part of the United Kingdom; however, the UK is responsible for their defence and international affairs. [[Gibraltar]] is a self-governing [[British Overseas Territories|overseas territory of the UK]]. Most of the other 13 British Overseas Territories also have autonomy in internal affairs through local legislatures.

;New Zealand dependent territories

[[New Zealand]] maintains nominal sovereignty over three [[Pacific Islands|Pacific Island]] nations. The [[Cook Islands]] and [[Niue]] are self-governing countries in [[freely associated state|free association]] with New Zealand that maintain some international relationships in their own name. [[Tokelau]] remains an autonomous dependency of New Zealand. The [[Chatham Islands]]—despite having the designation of ''Territory''—is an integral part of the country, situated within the New Zealand archipelago. The territory's council is not autonomous and has broadly the same powers as other local councils, although notably it can also charge levies on goods entering or leaving the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1995/0041/latest/DLM367666.html Chatham Islands Council Act 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Danish constituent countries

The [[Faroe Islands]] and [[Greenland]] are two autonomous countries within the [[Kingdom of Denmark]].

;Dutch constituent countries

[[Aruba]], [[Curaçao]], and [[Sint Maarten]] are autonomous countries within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], each with their own parliament. In addition they enjoy autonomy in taxation matters as well as having their own currencies.

;French overseas collectivities, New Caledonia, and Corsica
{{main article|Overseas collectivities}}
The French constitution recognises three autonomous jurisdictions. [[Corsica]], a [[region of France]], enjoys a greater degree of autonomy on matters such as tax and education compared to mainland regions. [[New Caledonia]], a ''sui generis'' collectivity, and [[French Polynesia]], an [[overseas collectivity]], are highly autonomous territories with their own government, legislature, currency and constitution. They do not, however, have legislative powers for policy areas relating to law and order, defense, border control or university education. Other smaller overseas collectivities have a lesser degree of autonomy through local legislatures. The five overseas regions, [[French Guiana]], [[Guadaloupe]], [[Martinique]], [[Mayotte]] and [[Réunion]], are generally governed the same as mainland regions; however, they enjoy some additional powers, including certain legislative powers for devolved areas.

===Ethiopian special woredas===
In [[Ethiopia]], "special woredas" are a subgroup of ''[[woreda]]s'' (districts) that are organized around the traditional homelands of an [[Demographics of Ethiopia|ethnic]] minority, and are outside the usual hierarchy of a ''[[Regions of Ethiopia|kilil]]'', or region. These ''woredas'' have many similarities to autonomous areas in other countries.

===Areas designated for indigenous peoples===
Other areas that are autonomous in nature but not in name are areas designated for [[indigenous peoples]], such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|those of the Americas]]:
* Aboriginal ([[First Nations|First Nation]] or [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] or Indian) [[Indian reserve]] and [[Indian reservation]], in, respectively, [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].{{discuss}}

'''Barbara &lt;!-- Please do not add "Brooks" as middle name unless reliably sourced -- apparent apocrypha. --&gt;Gittings''' (July 31, 1932&amp;nbsp;– February 18, 2007) was a prominent [[United States|American]] activist for [[LGBT equality]]. She organized the [[New York City|New York]] chapter of the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) from 1958 to 1963, edited the national DOB magazine ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]]'' from 1963–66, and worked closely with [[Frank Kameny]] in the 1960s on the first picket lines that brought attention to the ban on employment of gay people by the largest employer in the US at that time: the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]]. Her early experiences with trying to learn more about lesbianism fueled her lifetime work with libraries. In the 1970s, Gittings was most involved in the [[American Library Association]], especially its gay caucus, the first such in a professional organization, in order to promote positive literature about [[homosexuality]] in libraries. She was a part of the movement to get the [[American Psychiatric Association]] to drop homosexuality as a [[mental illness]] in 1972. Her self-described life mission was to tear away the "shroud of invisibility" related to homosexuality, which had theretofore been associated with crime and mental illness.&lt;ref name="citypaper"&gt;Warner David.{{cite web|url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/042299/feat.20q.shtml |title=20 questions |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516124313/http://www.citypaper.net/articles/042299/feat.20q.shtml |archivedate=2008-05-16 |df= }} CityPaper.net. April 22–29, 1999; accessed November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

She was awarded a lifetime membership in the [[American Library Association]], and the ALA named an annual award for the best gay or lesbian novel the [[Stonewall Book Award|Barbara Gittings Award]]. The [[GLAAD|Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) also named an activist award for her. At her memorial service, Matt Foreman, the executive director of the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] said, "What do we owe Barbara? Everything."&lt;ref&gt;Jennings, Kevin.{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kevin-jennings/fighting-for-freedom-in-p_b_47208.html|title=Fighting for Freedom in Philadelphia: Barbara Gittings, 1932-2007|work=Huffington Post|first=Kevin|last=Jennings|date=March 28, 2008}} ''The Huffington Post'', April 29, 2007; retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

===Education===
Barbara Gittings was born to Elizabeth (née Brooks) Gittings and John Sterett Gittings in [[Vienna, Austria]], where her father was serving as a U.S. [[diplomat]]. Barbara and her siblings attended Catholic schools in [[Montreal]]. She was so immersed in Catholicism at one point in her childhood that she considered becoming a [[nun]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Her family returned to the United States at the outbreak of [[World War II]] and settled in [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. Although aware of her attraction to other girls, Gittings said she first heard the word "homosexual" when she was rejected for membership in the [[National Honor Society]] in high school. Despite being an excellent student, a teacher who had reservations about her character took her aside and told her that the rejection was based on what the teacher believed were "homosexual inclinations".&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

While majoring in drama at [[Northwestern University]], Gittings developed a close but non-sexual friendship with another female student, prompting rumors that the two were lesbians, which led Gittings to examine her own sexual orientation. In her attempts to understand it, she had her suspicions confirmed by a psychiatrist who offered to cure her. Not having enough money to make regular visits, she was unable to get the money from her father, who reasoned there were no problems a psychiatrist could solve that a priest could not. A close friend suggested they see less of each other so as not to further encourage the rumors about them.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having no one to talk to about the issues that were consuming her, she decided to read as much as she could on the topic. She found very little, and much of what she found described homosexuals as "deviants", "perverts", and "abnormal" in medical books and texts on abnormal psychology, or odd generalizations that stated homosexuals were unable to whistle, or that their favorite color was green.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; She found all the information focused on homosexual men. {{citation needed|date=October 2014}} She recalled in a 2001 interview, "I thought, this is not about me. There is nothing here about love or happiness. There has to be something better".&lt;ref name="lotozo"&gt;Lotozo, Eils (May 2, 2001). "For early gay-rights activists, a chance to recall hard work." ''The Philadelphia Inquirer''; p. A01&lt;/ref&gt; Her research took up so much of her time at Northwestern that she ended up failing out of the school.&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt; Gittings found a purpose during this time, saying, "My mission was not to get a general education but to find out about myself and what my life would be like. So I stopped going to classes and started going to the library. There were no organizations to turn to in those days only libraries were safe, although the information contained was dismal."&lt;ref name="greenblatt"&gt;Greenblatt, R. "Barbara Gittings." ''Gay &amp; Lesbian Biography.'' St. James Press, 1997{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===After college===
At age 17, she returned from Northwestern "in disgrace"&lt;ref name="Tobin, p. 208"&gt;Tobin, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; after failing out of school and unable to tell her family why. But she was compelled to continue her search for information. She found some in the novels available at the time: ''[[Nightwood]]'', ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'', and ''[[Extraordinary Women]]''. Soon thereafter, her father discovered ''The Well of Loneliness'' in a pile of other things in her bedroom. He was so appalled at what he found that he instructed her to burn the book, but did so in a letter as he was unable to speak to her about it face to face.&lt;ref name="nytimesobitgittings"/&gt; Still eager to learn more about homosexuality, Gittings took a night course in abnormal psychology where she met a woman, with whom she had a brief affair, her first.&lt;ref name="Tobin, p. 208"/&gt; At age 18, she left home to be on her own and moved to [[Philadelphia]].

Gittings began to [[hitchhike]] on weekends to New York City, dressed as a man, to visit gay bars since she knew of none in Philadelphia, and knew of no other places to go to get "plugged into the gay community."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1975 interview, she recalled, "I wore [[drag (clothing)|drag]] because I thought that was a way to show I was gay. It's changed now, but in the early 50s there were basically two types of women in the gay bars: the so-called [[Butch and femme|butch]] ones in short hair and plain masculine attire and the so-called femme ones in dresses and high heels and makeup. I knew high heels and makeup weren't my personal style, so I thought...I must be the other kind!"&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gittings found very little in common with the women she met in the bars, and after witnessing a gay male acquaintance get beaten up after leaving a bar, began to focus her energies on collecting books. {{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

==Activism in the 1950s and 1960s==

===Daughters of Bilitis===
In 1956, Gittings traveled to [[California]] on the advice of [[Donald Webster Cory]], to visit the office of the new [[ONE, Inc.]], an early [[homophile]] organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met [[Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin]], who had co-founded the [[Daughters of Bilitis]] (DOB) in [[San Francisco]]. "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack&amp;nbsp;— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered.&lt;ref&gt;Gallo, Marcia. "To Barbara Gittings, 1932-2007: Thank You." ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review Worldwide''. Boston: May/June 2007. '''14''' (3) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional [[bisexual]] character, not even homosexual. "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, but they seemed to take it with reasonably good spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Katz, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Martin and Lyon asked Gittings to start a chapter in [[New York City]], which she did when less than a dozen women responded to her notice in the [[Mattachine Society]] newsletter asking for "all women in the New York area who are interested in forming a chapter of the DOB" on September 20, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, Steve and Hudson, L. (1998) "Barbara Gittings." ''Completely Queer: The Gay and Lesbian Encyclopedia''. Henry Holt and Company; {{ISBN|0-8050-3629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gittings served as the chapter's first president for three years, from 1958 until 1961, the year she met [[Kay Lahusen|Kay Tobin]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/865096291|title=Stonewall : the riots that sparked the gay revolution|last=David.|first=Carter,|date=2013|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=|isbn=9781429939393|location=New York|pages=38|oclc=865096291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Gittings remembered, "I joined the movement in 1958, when the subject of homosexuality was still shrouded in complete silence. There were no radio talk shows or TV documentaries. In all the United States, there were maybe a half dozen groups, two hundred people active in all."&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;Nelson, Bob. "Reconstructing Lesbian and Gay History", ''Gay Community News''. Boston: June 5, 1982. '''9''' (45) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The Daughters of Bilitis served as a social alternative to bars for lesbians, but took great care to deny that they were "arranging for 'immoral contacts'."&lt;ref&gt;Katz, pp. 428–29.&lt;/ref&gt; While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting. They met twice a month and often invited doctors, psychiatrists, ministers and attorneys to address their meetings, even if the message was clearly disparaging to lesbians. Gittings recalled, "At first we were so grateful just to have people&amp;nbsp;— anybody&amp;nbsp;— pay attention to us that we listened to and accepted everything they said, no matter how bad it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look to us today, was important."&lt;ref&gt;Katz, pp. 426–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gittings admitted that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals could see that gays and lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a [[mimeograph]] operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure that she would be fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, pp. 429–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Ladder''===
From 1963-66, she edited the organization's magazine, ''[[The Ladder (magazine)|The Ladder]],'' following both Lyon and Martin as editors. Although the Daughters of Bilitis did take a political stand in the 1959 San Francisco mayoral race,&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Phyllis. "S.F. Election Aftermath" The Ladder; 1959 '''4''' (3) p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin and Lyon preferred ''The Ladder'' to remain apolitical.&lt;ref name="soares"&gt;‘‘The Purloined Ladder: Its Place in Lesbian History.’’ Soares, Manuela. (1998) Co-published simultaneously in Journal of Homosexuality (The Haworth Press, Inc.) '''34''' (3/4) pp. 27–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Gittings was impressed with how her influence as editor impacted the magazine and the opinions of its readers. "I discovered the power of the press, the power to put in what you want in order to influence readers," she said.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1963 convention of the newly formed East Coast Homophile Organizations, the audience heard a speaker named Dr. [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] tell them that "the exclusive homosexual" was a [[psychopath]]. Articles and essays in ''The Ladder'' sometimes carried these viewpoints, since it was difficult to get psychiatrists and doctors to address homosexuality in any form. Gittings said, "People like Ellis talked about homosexuality being a sickness. And they talked about a cure&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;We'd sit there and listen and politely applaud and then go for the social hour afterward."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; However, after Dr. Ellis spoke, so did gay activist [[Frank Kameny]], making an impression upon Gittings with his point that it is useless to try to find cures and causes for homosexuality since there is no valid evidence that it is an illness. Said Gittings, "My thinking didn't change until Frank Kameny came along and he said plainly and firmly and unequivocally that homosexuality is no kind of sickness or disease or disorder or malfunction, it is fully on par with heterosexuality&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;Suddenly I found that I was looking at things that had happened in the past in a very different light and I was taking a position that was increasingly diverging from DOB’s positions."&lt;ref name="soares"/&gt;

Gittings began to implement changes in ''The Ladder'' that included adding "A Lesbian Review" underneath the title on the cover and replacing the line drawings on the cover with photographs of actual lesbians, often taken by her partner, [[Kay Lahusen]]. Gittings distributed ''The Ladder'' in six bookstores in New York and Philadelphia, and one [[Greenwich Village]] store displayed the magazine prominently, selling 100 copies a month.&lt;ref name="greenblatt"/&gt; The focus of the magazine shifted as well to tackling more controversial issues to spark debate,&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Kay; Gittings, Barbara. "Report '64." ''Ladder'', February /March 1965, '''9''' (5/6), pp. 13–17.&lt;/ref&gt; printing such articles titled "I Hate Women"&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Warren D.; Tobin, Kay; Hansen, Lily; Gittings, Barbara. "Echo REPORT '64."  ''Ladder'', January 1965, '''9'''  (4), pp. 4–22.&lt;/ref&gt; remarking on women who are politically apathetic, and "To Act or to Teach?"&lt;ref&gt;"Living Propaganda." ''Ladder'', January 1965, '''9''' (4), pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; that was a back-and-forth debate on whether it was more effective to educate the public or take political action.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests===
Gittings participated in many of the [[List of LGBT actions in the United States prior to the Stonewall riots|earliest LGBT actions in the United States]]. In 1965, Gittings marched in the first gay [[picketing (protest)|picket line]]s at the [[White House]],&lt;ref&gt;"Homosexuals Stage Protest in Capital." ''New York Times'': May 30, 1965. p. 42; retrieved October 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the US [[State Department]], and at [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in Philadelphia to protest the federal government's policy on discrimination of homosexuals, holding a sign that read "Sexual preference is irrelevant to federal employment."&lt;ref name="historymonth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=14 |title=Barbara Gittings |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224422/http://www.glbthistorymonth.com/glbthistorymonth/bio.cfm?LeaderID=14 |archivedate=September 26, 2007 }} Glbt History Month; October 14, 2006; retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nypl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypl.org/press/2007/GittingsArchivepr.cfm|title=Archive of Influential Gay Rights Activists Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin Lahusen acquired by The New York Public Library}} (Press Release). New York Public Library; retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The men who agreed to picket had to wear suits and ties, and the women who participated were to wear dresses, heels, and pantyhose so as to look employable by the federal government. Reactions from passersby were varied. A tourist witnessing the demonstration remarked, "I still don't believe it. Somebody's kidding." A stunned high school student pointed out, "They all look so normal."&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, Kay. "Picketing: The Impact &amp; The Issues." ''The Ladder'', September 1965, '''9''' (12), p. 4; retrieved October 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gittings recalled, "I remember a man said to his kids, 'Hold your noses&amp;nbsp;— it's dirty here.' And there was a woman dragging a string of kids who said, very angrily, 'You should all be married and have children like me.'"&lt;ref name="lotozo"/&gt; Leaflets were distributed to passersby that described their reasons for picketing, surprising some recipients who were unaware gays and lesbians could be fired so easily, and disgusting others. Gittings remembered, "It was risky and we were scared. Picketing was not a popular tactic at the time. And our cause seemed outlandish even to most gay people." {{citation needed|date=April 2014}} The evening prior to the group's picketing the State Department, Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] announced the pickets at a press conference. Gittings connected the high-profile visibility with a "breakthrough into mainstream publicity."&lt;ref name="stonewall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088782|title=Before Stonewall (film)|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965-69, she and [[Frank Kameny]] led the [[Annual Reminder]], picketing at Independence Hall in Philadelphia on July 4, until the [[Stonewall Riots]] in June 1969. After the riots, the annual [[Gay Pride Parade]] commemorating the riots took its place.
Differences in Gittings' political stance and the leadership of the DOB began to show, and came to a culmination in 1966 when she was ousted as the editor of ''The Ladder'' for, as one source claims, creating the issue that reported on the DOB convention late,&lt;ref name="soares"/&gt; but according to another source because she removed "For Adults Only" on the cover of the magazine without consulting the DOB.&lt;ref&gt;Lo, Melinda. {{cite web|url=http://www.afterellen.com/archive/ellen/column/2005/11/backintheday2.html |title=Back in the Day |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716193559/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.afterellen.com%2Farchive%2Fellen%2Fcolumn%2F2005%2F11%2Fbackintheday2.html |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }} afterellen.com; November 1, 2005; retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1967, Gittings and Kameny worked together as co-counsel in hearings held by the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] to discredit an expert witness named Dr. [[Charles Socarides]], who testified that homosexuals could be converted to [[heterosexuality]], and to call in question the policy held by the Department of Defense that homosexual employees could be fired for being named as homosexuals.&lt;ref&gt;Lissner, Will. "Homosexual Fights Rule in Security Clearance." ''The New York Times'': November 26, 1967. p. 70; retrieved October 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "Publicity was the objective", Gittings recalled many years later. Kameny and Gittings dressed conservatively, but wore buttons that said "Gay is Good" and "Pray for Sodomy." "We held press conferences for the benefit of sharp-eyed reporters. When we first went into a hearing room, we made certain to shake hands with all ... participants so (they) could not avoid reading our buttons.&lt;ref name="perry"&gt;Document 66: Barbara Gittings and Frank Kameny Push the Pentagon (1966).

Gittings made hundreds of appearances as a speaker in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, p. 246.&lt;/ref&gt; She carried on her mission to convince heterosexuals and homosexuals alike that homosexuality is not an illness, stating in a letter in 1967:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I keep trying to convince people in the movement that the charge of sickness is perhaps our greatest problem ... we can't really progress in other directions until the unsubstantiated assumption of sickness...is demolished! It's almost always there, however slyly or covertly or even unconsciously, however 'sympathetic' the person: the attitude that homosexuality is somehow undesirable, some sort of twist or malfunction or failure or maladaptation or other kind of psychic sickness. And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO ''not'' get equal treatment. Equal treatment&amp;nbsp;— no more, no less&amp;nbsp;— is what we want! And compassion&amp;nbsp;— which many homosexuals gladly swallow because they think it represents an improvement in attitudes toward them&amp;nbsp;— is not equal treatment.&lt;ref name="nypl"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Activism in the 1970s and later==

===American Library Association===
In the 1970s, Gittings continued her search for resources in libraries that addressed homosexuality in a positive, supportive way. In discussing her pursuit of the improvement of materials for gays and lesbians in libraries, she said, "For years I would haunt libraries and secondhand book shops trying to find stories to read about my people, and then I became active in other arenas of the gay rights movement, but I always kept an eye on the emerging literature...It began to talk about homosexuals who were healthy and happy and wholesome and who had good lives...That rang the bells for me—libraries, gay books!"&lt;ref name="ala"&gt;Kniffel, Leonard.{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ala.org/AL100.php?title=what_the_barbara_gittings_interview_didn&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |title=What the Barbara Gittings Interview Didn't Tell You |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930201016/http://blogs.ala.org/AL100.php?title=what_the_barbara_gittings_interview_didn&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }} A CentenniAL Blog.

Gittings found a home in the gay group that formed in 1970 in the [[American Library Association]], the first gay [[caucus]] in a professional association, and became its coordinator in 1971. She pushed the American Library Association for more visibility for gays and lesbians in the profession. She staffed a [[kissing booth]] at the [[Dallas]] convention of the ALA, underneath the banner "Hug a Homosexual," with a "women only" side and a "men only" side.&lt;ref name="Bullough, p. 247"&gt;Bullough, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; When no one took advantage of it, she and ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' author [[Alma Routsong]] (pen name: Isabel Miller) kissed in front of rolling television cameras. In describing its success, despite most of the reaction being negative, Gittings said, "We needed to get an audience. So we decided, let's show gay love live. We were offering free—mind you, free—same-sex kisses and hugs. Let me tell you, the aisles were mobbed, but no one came into the booth to get a free hug. So we hugged and kissed each other. It was shown twice on the evening news, once again in the morning. It put us on the map."&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt;

Gittings made an appearance on the ''[[Phil Donahue Show]]'' in 1970 and on PBS' ''[[David Susskind]] Show'' in 1971, along with six other lesbians, including Lilli Vincenz and Barbara Love. They were among the first open lesbians to appear on television in the US, and debated long-held [[stereotype]]s about gays with Susskind. A week after her appearance on the ''David Susskind Show'', a middle-aged couple approached Gittings in the [[supermarket]] to claim, "You made me realize that you gay people love each other just the way Arnold and I do."&lt;ref name="Bullough, p. 247"/&gt;

===American Psychiatric Association===
[[File:Barbara Gittings, Frank Kameny, and John Fryer in disguise as "Dr. H. Anonymous".jpg|thumb|250 px|Barbara Gittings, [[Frank Kameny]], and [[John E. Fryer]] in disguise as Dr. H. Anonymous at a panel discussing psychiatry and homosexuality]]
In 1972, Gittings and Kameny organized a discussion with the American Psychiatric Association entitled "Psychiatry: Friend or Foe to Homosexuals: A Dialogue", where a panel of psychiatrists were to discuss homosexuality. When Gittings' partner Kay Tobin Lahusen noticed that all the psychiatrists were heterosexual, she protested. Gittings remembered, "My partner, Kay, said, 'This isn't right—here you have two psychiatrists pitted against two gays, and what you really need is someone who is both.' The panel moderator, Dr. Kent Robinson, agreed to add a gay psychiatrist if we could find one. In 1972 who would come forward? ... Kay and I wrote letters and made phone calls around the country."&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Moran, Mark. {{cite web|url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/full/41/21/17 |title=Activists Forced Psychiatrists To Look Behind Closet Door }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Psychiatric News; November 3, 2006; retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A gay psychiatrist in Philadelphia finally agreed to appear on the panel in heavy disguise, and with a voice distorting microphone, calling himself "Dr. H. Anonymous". He was  [[John E. Fryer]], and he discussed how he was forced to be closeted while practicing psychiatry. Gittings read aloud letters from psychiatrists she had solicited who declined to appear for fear of professional ostracism. She described the event as "transformative".&lt;ref&gt;Katz, pp. 432–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, homosexuality was removed from the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]] as a mental disorder,&lt;ref&gt;Herek, Gregory. {{cite web|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/html/facts_mental_health.html|title=Facts About Homosexuality and Mental Health}} Sexual Orientation: Science, Education and Policy. Retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gittings celebrated by being photographed with the Philadelphia newspaper headlines, "Twenty Million Homosexuals Gain Instant Cure."&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gittings spent 16 years working with libraries and campaigning to get positive gay and lesbian-themed materials into libraries and to eliminate [[censorship]] and job [[discrimination]]. She wrote ''Gays in Library Land: The Gay and Lesbian Task Force of the American Library Association: The First Sixteen Years.'', a brief history of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Carmichael, James, ed. (1998) ''Daring to Find Our Names: The Search for Lesbigay Library History''. Greenwood Press; {{ISBN|978-0-313-29963-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; She helped start what was then called the National Gay Task Force, later to be named the [[National Gay and Lesbian Task Force]] (NGLTF) in 1973. Gittings served on the board of the NGLTF throughout the 1980s. She inspired nurses to form the Gay Nurses Alliance in 1973. She held exhibits at APA conventions in 1972, 1976, and 1978, her last one being "Gay Love: Good Medicine" that portrayed gays as happy and healthy.&lt;ref&gt;Bullough, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gittings appeared in the documentary films ''Gay Pioneers'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0425999/|title=Gay Pioneers at imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Before Stonewall]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088782/|title=Before Stonewall at imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstrunfeatures.com/beforestonewalldvd.html|title=Before Stonewall at First Run Features}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[After Stonewall]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244955/|title=After Stonewall at imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstrunfeatures.com/afterstonewalldvd.html|title=After Stonewall at First Run Features}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Out of the Past'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141699/|title=Out of the Past at imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Pride Divide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0156910/|title=Pride and Divide at imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 she remembered her decisions to be as open as she was throughout her life when she said, "Every time I had to make a decision to put myself forward or to stay back, to use my real name or not, to go on television or decline, to get out on some of the earliest picket lines or remain behind. I usually took the public position because there weren't many of us yet that could afford the risk."&lt;ref name="perry"/&gt;

In 1999, Gittings was honored for her contributions to the LGBT cause at the seventh annual PrideFest America, in Philadelphia. The organization described Gittings as "the [[Rosa Parks]] of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://0-web.b.ebscohost.com.sultan.tnstate.edu/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=a1447df3-b03a-465e-adc9-1e4616b8f71c%2540sessionmgr113&amp;hid=125|title=Millennium Web Catalog|website=0-web.b.ebscohost.com.sultan.tnstate.edu|access-date=2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gittings was renowned for her "ferocious dedication to the cause with a cock-eyed optimism, kindness, and gentle sense of humor."&lt;ref name="ala" /&gt; As recognition for Gittings' contributions to the promotion of gay and lesbian literature, in 2002 the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Round Table of the ALA renamed one of their three book awards the [[Stonewall Book Award]]-Barbara Gittings Literature Award.&lt;ref name="ALA - Stonewall Book Award History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stonewall Book Awards History|url=http://www.ala.org/glbtrt/award/history|website=ALA.org|publisher=American Library Association|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the [[Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] honored her by bestowing her the first Barbara Gittings Award, highlighting dedication to activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2001 GLAAD Media Awards|url=http://awardsandwinners.com/category/glaad-media-award/2001/|accessdate=26 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, the [[Free Library of Philadelphia]] announced its Barbara Gittings Collection of books dedicated to gay and lesbian issues.&lt;ref&gt;Lin, Jennifer (June 27, 2001).

In 2003, the [[American Library Association]] rewarded her with its highest tribute, lifetime honorary membership. She also earned the first John E. Fryer Award from the American Psychiatric Association in 2006 with Frank Kameny.&lt;ref name="moran"/&gt; The award goes to people who have made a significant impact on the mental health of gays and lesbians.

==Personal life==
Gittings was an avid music lover, most interested in [[Baroque music|Baroque]] and [[Renaissance music]]. She sang in choral groups for most of her life, spending over 50 years in the [[Philadelphia Chamber Chorus]].&lt;ref name="Bullough, p. 250"&gt;Bullough, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a hiking and [[canoe]]ing enthusiast. She and her lifelong partner, [[Kay Lahusen|Kay Tobin]] (also known as Kay Tobin Lahusen; born 1930) met in 1961 at a picnic in [[Rhode Island]]. Gittings described how they began: "We hit it off, we started courting. I flew to [[Boston]] [to see her] and got off the plane with a big bunch of flowers in my hand. I couldn't resist. I did not care what the world thought. I dropped the flowers, grabbed her and kissed her. That was not being done in 1961."&lt;ref name="citypaper"/&gt;

[[File:Barbara Gittings 2006.jpg|thumb|Barbara Gittings at [[UCLA]] on November 17, 2006.]]Gittings and Lahusen were together for 46 years. They donated copies of some materials and photographs covering their activism to the [[Cornell University]] Rare and Manuscript Collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/EAD/htmldocs/RMM07645.html|title=Guide to the Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin Lahusen collection, 1965-2007}} Cornell University Library Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections; retrieved November 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Lahusen donated all of their original papers and photographs to the [[New York City Public Library]] (NYPL), whose head, Paul LeClerc, said, "The collection donated by Barbara Gittings and Kay Tobin Lahusen is a remarkable first-hand chronicle detailing the battles of gays and lesbians to overcome the prejudice and restrictions that were prevalent prior to the activism and protest movements that started in the 1960s."&lt;ref name="nypl"/&gt;

The [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] main library received a donation of over 1,000 of Gittings' and Lahusen's books in 2007; it is the Gittings-Lahusen Gay Book Collection, Call no.: RB 005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/news/gittings07.html |title=UMASS Amherst Library Announces Gift: Barbara Gittings-Kay Tobin Lahusen Gay Book Collection |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106163414/http://www.library.umass.edu/news/gittings07.html |archivedate=2008-01-06 |df= }}University of Massachusetts website; retrieved October 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Gittings and Lahusen pushed the [[American Association of Retired Persons]] (AARP) to grant couple's membership to them, for a reduced price on [[health insurance]].&lt;ref name="Bullough, p. 250"/&gt; One of her last acts as an activist was to [[coming out|come out]] in the newsletter published by the [[assisted living facility]] they reside in. On February 18, 2007, Gittings died in [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania]] after a long battle with [[breast cancer]]. She is survived by her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen, and her sister, Eleanor Gittings Taylor. In 1999, Gittings summed up her inspiration for her activism: "As a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and what it meant to be gay. Now for 48 years I've had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world too. It's hard work&amp;nbsp;— but it's vital, and it's gratifying, and it's often fun!"&lt;ref name="historymonth"/&gt;

'''Camp Cropper''' was a holding facility for security detainees operated by the [[United States Army]] near [[Baghdad International Airport]] in [[Iraq]].  The facility was initially operated as a [[high-value detention site]] (HVD), but has since been expanded increasing its capacity from 163 to 2,000 detainees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/saddam-iap.htm |title=Camp Cropper / High Value Detention (HVD) Site |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=2006-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] was held there prior to his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Alex Massie |title=Nurse: Dictator spent captivity feeding birds |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/01/02/wiraq102.xml |work=Telegraph |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2007-04-09 |authorlink= Alex Massie (Journalist) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Camp Cropper was established by the [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company]] (HHC) of the [http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/army/115mp.htm 115th Military Police Battalion] in April 2003. It is named for Staff Sgt. Kenneth Cropper, a member of the Maryland Army National Guard who died in March 2002 while supporting security operations at the Pentagon. The facility was originally established as a High Value Detainee (HVD) holding area.  Shortly after being established, its mission was expanded to also be a Corps Holding Area (CHA). Initially, the facility was meant to serve as "central booking" for the US forces operating in Baghdad and central Iraq, though detainees from northern Iraq were brought there as well. The original concept called for a small temporary camp that could hold up to 300 detainees for no more than 72 hours.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} After being processed at Camp Cropper detainees were supposed to be shipped to other detention facilities in Baghdad and throughout Iraq. However, in practice, this proved unworkable since most other prisons in Baghdad were badly damaged by looting after the fall of the [[Ba'ath Party|Baath]] regime.

Additional units to operate Camp Cropper include:
* 186 Military Police Company, Iowa National Guard April 2003 and February 2008.
* C &amp; B Co, 2-103 AR, [[Pennsylvania Army National Guard]], as part of the 89th and later 43rd MP BDEs.
* 439th Military Police Detachment, Army Reserve from [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].
* 324th Military Police Battalion, Army Reserve from [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]], [[Pennsylvania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=324th Military Police Battalion Lineage and Honors|url= http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/mp/0324mpbn.htm |publisher=U.S. Army Center for Military History}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 117th Military Police Battalion, [[Tennessee]] Army National Guard

In August 2006, a [[combat support hospital]] was opened on Camp Cropper that would treat both coalition soldiers and detainees from Camp Cropper.

On March 15, 2007 military officials announced plans to once again expand Camp Bucca and Camp Cropper. Officials stated that this increase in capacity would be necessary to handle the detainees generated from the increased security operations in [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Walter |last=Pincus |title=U.S. plans to expand detention centers |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/nationworld/sfl-airaqdetain15mar15,0,7242722.story?track=rss |work=Washington Post |publisher=Sun-Sentinel |date=2007-03-15 |accessdate=2007-03-15 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2010 the Camp Cropper facility was turned over to the Iraqi government and renamed Karkh Prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Detainee Ops Chief Gives Karkh Prison Good Reviews|url=http://www.army.mil/article/56162/Detainee_ops_chief_gives_Karkh_prison_good_reviews/|publisher=U.S. Army Public Affairs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A portion of Camp Cropper was still in use by the US Army until December 2011 through the 40th MP Battalion 15th MP Brigade, the 105th MP Battalion, 3rd Brigade 4th Infantry Division MP platoon, and 108th MP Company 16th MP Brigade.

On 2004-06-16, [[The Pentagon]] confirmed a report in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that former [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] chief [[George Tenet]] had been allowed by former [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] to have an Iraqi prisoner secretly detained at Camp Cropper since November, but denied they were trying to hide the prisoner from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jamie |last=McIntyre |title=Pentagon: Iraqi held secretly at CIA request |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/06/16/ghost.prisoner/index.html |work=CNN |date=2004-06-16 |accessdate=2007-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld later told reporters that the prisoner was treated humanely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Bowman |title=Rumsfeld admits telling military to hide detainee |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/iraq/bal-te.rumsfeld18jun18,0,4914397.story?coll=bal-iraq-utility |work=Baltimore Sun |date=2004-06-18 |accessdate=2007-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930043947/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nationworld/iraq/bal-te.rumsfeld18jun18%2C0%2C4914397.story?coll=bal-iraq-utility |archivedate=2007-09-30 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the [[Red Cross]] was given regular and open access to the facility and the detainees, the [[Red Cross]] documented severe living conditions, harsh treatment by guards, and poor medical care.

The '''Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland''' was an internal grouping within the [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) that formed in response to the efforts of the [[79 Group]] within the party.  The 79 Group was another internal grouping within the SNP that was attempting to turn the party into an expressly [[socialist]] party.  The Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland formed itself to try to ensure that the SNP avoided traditional debates of left and right, arguing that the cause of [[Scottish independence]] transcended such arguments.  It had the support of prominent traditionalists inside the party such as [[Winnie Ewing]] who had been a [[Member of Parliament]] in the 1960s and was by this stage a Member of the [[European Parliament]].

SNP leader [[Gordon Wilson (Scottish politician)|Gordon Wilson]] was determined to end factionalism inside the SNP, and at the party conference of 1982 internal groupings were banned.  This was largely a reaction to the growth of the 79 Group who faded in significance after this decision was taken.  After the 79 Group fell apart the Campaign for Nationalism in Scotland did likewise (however, many of the members of the 79 group were readmitted, and indeed came to lead the party).

'''Carnauba''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑːr|ˈ|n|ɔː|b|ə|,_|-|n|aʊ|-}}; {{lang-pt|carnaúba}} {{IPA-pt|kahnaˈubɐ|}}), also called '''Brazil wax''' and '''palm wax''', is a [[wax]] of the leaves of the palm ''[[Copernicia prunifera]]'' (Synonym: ''Copernicia cerifera''), a plant native to and grown only in the northeastern [[Brazil]]ian states of [[Piauí]], [[Ceará]], [[Maranhão]], [[Bahia]], and [[Rio Grande do Norte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinle |first=J.

It is obtained from the leaves of the carnauba palm by collecting and drying them, beating them to loosen the wax, then refining and bleaching the wax.

==Composition==
[[File:Carnauba.jpg|thumb|right|Carnauba palm]]
Carnauba consists mostly of aliphatic esters (40 wt%), diesters of [[4-hydroxycinnamic acid]] (21.0 wt%), ω-hydroxycarboxylic acids (13.0 wt%), and fatty alcohols (12 wt%). The compounds are predominantly derived from acids and alcohols in the C26-C30 range. Distinctive for carnauba wax is the high content of diesters as well as methoxycinnamic acid.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Uwe Wolfmeier, Hans Schmidt, Franz-Leo Heinrichs, Georg Michalczyk, Wolfgang Payer, Wolfram Dietsche, Klaus Boehlke, Gerd Hohner, Josef Wildgruber "Waxes" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carnauba wax is sold in several grades, labeled T1, T3, and T4, depending on the purity level.  Purification is accomplished by filtration, centrifugation, and bleaching.

[[File:Suikerbonen De Bock Lentilles - Assortie.JPG|thumb|right|Candy coated with carnauba wax]]

==Properties==
Carnauba wax can produce a glossy finish and as such is used in automobile waxes, [[shoe polish]]es, [[dental floss]], food products such as [[sweets]], instrument [[polishing|polishes]], and floor and furniture waxes and [[polishing|polishes]], especially when mixed with [[beeswax]] and with [[turpentine]]. Use for [[coated paper|paper coatings]] is the most common application in the United States{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}. It was commonly used in its purest form as a coating on speedboat hulls in the early 1960s to enhance speed and aid in handling in salt water environments.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It is also the main ingredient in [[surfboard wax]], combined with [[coconut oil]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Because of its [[hypoallergenic]] and [[emollient]] properties as well as its shine, carnauba wax appears as an ingredient in many [[cosmetics]] formulas where it is used to thicken lipstick, eyeliner, [[mascara]], eye shadow, foundation, deodorant, various skin care preparations, sun care preparations, etc.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} It is also used to make [[cutler's resin]].

It is the finish of choice for most [[Erica arborea|briar]] tobacco or smoking [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipes]]. It produces a high gloss finish when buffed on to wood. This finish dulls with time rather than flaking off (as is the case with most other finishes used).

Although too brittle to be used by itself, carnauba wax is often combined with other waxes (principally [[beeswax]]) to treat and waterproof many leather products where it provides a high-gloss finish and increases leather's hardness and durability.

It is also used in the pharmaceutical industry as a tablet-coating agent. Adding the carnauba wax aids in the swallowing of tablets for patients.  A very small amount (less than a hundredth of one percent by weight, i.e., 30 grams for a 300&amp;nbsp;kg batch) is sprinkled onto a batch of tablets after they have been sprayed and dried.  The wax and tablets are then tumbled together for a few minutes before being discharged from the tablet-coating machine. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1890, [[Charles Tainter]] patented the use of carnauba wax on [[phonograph cylinder]]s as a replacement for a mixture of [[Paraffin wax|paraffin]] and [[beeswax]].

Carnauba wax may be used as a mold [[release agent]] for manufacture of [[fibre-reinforced plastic]]s. An aerosol mold release agent is formed by dissolving carnauba wax in a solvent. Unlike [[silicone]] or [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]], carnauba is suitable for use with liquid [[epoxy]], epoxy molding compounds (EMC), and some other plastic types and generally enhances their properties {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}. Carnauba wax is not very soluble in chlorinated or aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="Apps"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Carnauba is used in melt/castable explosives to produce an insensitive explosive formula such as [[Composition B]], which is a blend of [[RDX]] and [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]].

==Production and export==
In 2006, Brazil produced 22,409 tons of carnauba wax, of which 14% was [[solid]] wax, and 86% was in [[powder (substance)|powder]] form.
&lt;ref name="repport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/portals/0/downloads/carnaubawax.pdf |title=Carnauba Wax Background Paper
 |date=January 2011 |website=ethicalconsumer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are 20-25 exporters of carnauba wax in Brazil who buy the carnauba wax from middlemen or directly from farmers. The exporters [[refine]] the wax before exporting it to the rest of the world. 
The four largest exporters of carnauba wax are Pontes, Brasil Ceras, Foncepi, and Carnauba do Brasil, who together account for around €25 million of the export market. According to the German television program [[:de:Markt (WDR)#Markencheck|''Markencheck'']], conditions for many carnauba production workers are quite poor; one [[Ministry of Labour and Employment (Brazil)|Brazilian Labor Ministry]] official found conditions "that could be described as slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Der Haribo-Check|url=http://www.daserste.de/information/ratgeber-service/markencheck/sendung/markencheck-folge-2-102.html|work=Markencheck|publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]|date=October 16, 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haribo gummy bear ingredients made by modern slaves, documentary shows|url=http://www.dw.com/en/haribo-gummy-bear-ingredients-made-by-modern-slaves-documentary-shows/a-41036821|date=October 19, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|last=Knight|first=Ben|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Brazilian [[Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade]], the major destinations for exported carnauba wax are:
* USA (25%)
* [[Japan]] (15–25%)
* Germany (10–15%)
* Netherlands (5%)
* Italy (5%)
* other destinations (18%)

==Technical characteristics==
*[[INCI|INCI name]] is ''Copernicia cerifera (carnauba) wax''
*[[E Number]] is E903.
*Melting point: {{convert|82|-|86|C|F}}, among the highest of natural waxes, higher than [[beeswax]], 62–64C.
*Relative density is about 0.97
*It is among the hardest of natural waxes.

The '''chief governance officer''' ('''CGO''') is normally a senior vice executive reporting to the [[chief executive officer|CEO]], however in the not-for-profit sector when an organization uses [[Policy Governance]] the Chair of the Board often takes on the role of CGO, who is tasked with directing the people, business processes and systems needed to enable [[good governance]] from inside the corporation in support of the [[board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://my.advisor.com/doc/14131 CGO On Duty.

The role is likely to grow in prominence as [[corporate governance]] requirements - in voluntary codes or law - grow and mature.

Also, the appointment of a CGO with clout is both a signal to the market that the company takes corporate governance seriously and a way to increase the market value of a firm if, as research by [[McKinsey &amp; Co|McKinsey]] shows, investors will pay a premium for the stock of well-governed companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mkqpreview1.qdweb.net/Nonprofit/Three_surveys_on_corporate_governance_965 Coombes, P &amp; Watson, M.

As corporations add the necessary functions, several issues arise. First is the risk that the functions overlap, evolve into silos, create misunderstanding internally and externally and act at [[cross purposes]]. Second is the opportunity for enhanced impact through synergy between these functions. Risk managers, compliance officers and business performance managers often need to manage change in order to achieve their objectives. Without a sponsor at top management level their efforts may fail when the magnitude of resistance to change overwhelms their limited powers of influence. Third, the serial introduction of new processes may simply require more attention, time and enthusiasm than line managers can realistically offer.&lt;ref&gt;Kotter, J. (2005). Leading change. Cambridge, MA: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A single phased plan for enabling good governance could mitigate the risks and preempt any wasteful expenditure. Last, the complexity of the interactions between the different functions compounded by the infancy of the new disciplines may require continuous conceptual interpretation for top management and the board.

The Co-Managed IT security service model entails security monitoring, event correlation, incident response, system tuning, and compliance support across an organization’s entire IT environment. Co-Management allows organizations to collaborate with their service providers by blending security expertise of the provider with the contextual knowledge of the customer to optimize security posture.

Co-Managed security services also allow for organizations’ critical data and tools to be remotely managed by a team of certified engineers and security analysts from a 24/7/365 [[Information_security_operations_center|Security Operations Center (SOC)]]. This service approach allows for customer data to remain in-house while the [[Security_information_and_event_management|SIEM]] platform is either on-site or cloud-hosted. The service provider’s staff works in conjunction with customer security teams to outline the rules of engagement inside the environment to provide monitoring and respond to alerts in real-time. The Security Operation Center also provide the “care and feeding”, and development of a variety of security solutions. The co-managed approach also allows organizations to focus on emerging internal projects and other critical areas of IT.

According to Gartner’s [https://www.gartner.com/doc/3112220/use-comanaged-siem How and When to Use Co-managed Security Information and Event Management report], “Co-managed SIEM services enable security and risk management leaders to maximize value from SIEM and enhance security monitoring capabilities, while retaining control and flexibility.” and "Co-management is on the rise and expected to grow five-fold by 2020."

''SIEM,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/security-information-and-event-management-siem&lt;/ref&gt; IDS/IPS, Compliance Automation, Network Configuration Management Tools, Advanced Threat Intelligence, Network Access Control, Endpoint Threat Detection and Response, Application Security, File Integrity Monitoring, Forensic Investigation, and Vulnerability Scanning and Assessment'', are all examples of cyber security solutions that co-managed service providers support&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eventtracker.com/campaigns/co-managed-siem/&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Credit and Investments Ombudsman''' (CIO) (until 2014 known as the Credit Ombudsman Service) is an Australian [[alternative dispute resolution]] or [[ombudsman]] that helps settle disputes between consumers and financial [[credit (finance)|credit]] providers. It was established in 2003 as a result of the Mortgage &amp; Finance Association of Australia ('MFAA') self-regulation, originally called the Mortgage Industry Ombudsman Scheme (MIOS). It later expanded its remit to include non-bank lending and other credit services, changing its name to the Credit Ombudsman Service Limited (COSL) to reflect this broader jurisdiction. Since November 2014 the scheme has been known as Credit and Investments Ombudsman. The Credit and Investments Ombudsman is one of the largest External Dispute Resolution (EDR) schemes in Australia by number of members, totaling over 22,000 in 2016.

The CIO covers the following institutions:
* [[Credit (finance)|Credit]] providers
* Credit representatives
* [[Fund manager]]s
* [[Credit unions]]
* [[Building society|Building societies]]
* [[Leasing]] companies
* [[Small Amount-lenders]]
* [[Mortgage Brokers]]
* [[Non-banking financial company|non-bank lenders]]
* [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] [[managers]]
* [[Loan origination|mortgage originators]]
* [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/aggregation aggregators]
* [[Wholesale funding|wholesale funders]]
* [[Trustee|securitisation trustees]]
* [[housing co-operative]]s
* [[mortgage insurance|mortgage insurers]]
* [[Investment|Fund Managers]]
* [[Investment|Planners &amp; Advisors]]
* [[Debt Services|Collections]]
* [[Leasing|Hire &amp; Rental]]

== History ==
The Credit and Investments Ombudsman was first established as the Mortgage Industry Ombudsman Service Limited (MIOS) on 18 June 2003 as an EDR (External Dispute Resolution, known in other regions as [[Alternative dispute resolution|ADR]]) scheme, and commenced operations on 1 July 2003 . They adopted the name Credit Ombudsman Service Limited (COSL) on 17 February 2004 before becoming the Credit and Investments Ombudsman (CIO) on 19 November 2014.

CIO is an approved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asic.gov.au/ASIC/asic.nsf/byHeadline/07-156%20New%20online%20help%20for%20people%20making%20a%20complaint?opendocument|title=ASIC online help for people making a complaint|last=|first=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070903225345/http://www.asic.gov.au/ASIC/asic.nsf/byHeadline/07-156%20New%20online%20help%20for%20people%20making%20a%20complaint?opendocument|archivedate=2007-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic.nsf/byheadline/ASIC+approved+external+complaints+resolution+schemes|title=ASIC approved EDR schemes|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/541992/fromItemId/815972/quickLinkId/816534/whichType/sng#|title=Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDR scheme under scheme approved by [http://www.asic.gov.au// ASIC]’s Regulatory Guide [http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/pdflib.nsf/LookupByFileName/ps139.pdf/$file/ps139.pdf// RG 139] and its services are free for consumers. Funding is sourced from a combination of its membership fees and complaint fees paid by its participating Members. CIO can award compensation up to a maximum of $309,000 and other remedies, such as an apology, can be asked for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cio.org.au/news/member-news/increase-of-monetary-compensation-limit/|title=Increase of monetary compensation limit - CIO|website=www.cio.org.au|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complaints process==
CIO considers [[complaint]]s or disputes about its participating Members' concerning their products and services, such as [[mortgages]], credit products, financial planning, managed investment, insurance and deposit taking ([[saving]]s).

CIO resolves disputes in a non-[[adjudicative]] means through [[conciliation]], although the actual Ombudsman can make a decision which is binding on the member (a [[Determination]]).  Like all [https://web.archive.org/web/20100415124741/http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/pdflib.nsf/LookupByFileName/rg139.pdf/%24file/rg139.pdf ASIC RG 139] approved schemes, Determinations made by the Ombudsman bind Members but not complainants.

CIO’s conciliation process is both inquisitorial and consensus-based and focuses on producing a mutually satisfactory outcome.  Both Members and consumers are afforded an equal opportunity to put forward their cases.  This is intended to ensure procedural fairness and promote effective dispute resolution.

===Coverage===
The Credit and Investments Ombudsman covers complaints for consumers if they have dealt with a participating Member of CIO as:
* a borrower or prospective borrower 
* a loan guarantor or prospective guarantor 
* or have in any way sought the services of a Member in the ordinary course of their business in the credit marketplace.

===Prior steps===
Before CIO can consider a complaint, the complainant's must first have tried to resolve their complaint with the Member concerned by expressing their dissatisfaction either in writing or via telephone.

Every CIO Member has to have a dedicated Complaints Contact Person as part of their membership and must also have in place procedures called Internal Dispute Resolution Procedures or 'IDR Procedures'. The IDR Procedures require that a Member must:
* give you the name and contact details of their Complaints Contact Person before undertaking any services for you. 
* give you a copy of their Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) Procedures if you ask for them.
* give you a substantive response within 45 days of lodging your complaint with them (if there is a delay they must inform you of the reason).

===Complaints covered===
The types of complaints covered by the CIO are set out in the CIO Rules. In general, a consumer can make a complaint to CIO if they believe that the Member they have dealt with has:
* breached relevant laws.
* breached the MFAA Code of Practice or other recognised Codes of Practice.
* not met standards of good practice in the Credit Industry.
* acted unfairly.

There are some types of disputes that CIO are unable to consider which are specified in the CIO Rules and Guidelines.

* if the complaint is about someone who is not a Member of CIO at the time the complaint is made. 
* if the complainant is not the person to whom the credit services in question were directly provided by the Member.
* if a claim where the loss caused by the FSP’s conduct is, or appears to be, more than $500,000.
* if the complaint is being, or has previously been, dealt with by a court, tribunal, arbitrator or other dispute resolution scheme.
* if the complaint is more appropriately dealt with by the courts or other procedure.

===Cost===
There is no fee for individuals or small businesses when making a complaint to the Credit and Investments Ombudsman all costs are covered by the scheme members.

DRDA has traditionally been the principal organ at the district level to oversee the implementation of anti-poverty programmes of the Ministry of Rural Development. This agency was created originally to implement the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP). Subsequently the DRDAs were entrusted with number of programmes of both state and central governments. From April 1999&lt;ref&gt;http://rural.nic.in/sites/downloads/right-information-act/DRDA_RTI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;a separate DRDA Administration has been introduced to take care of the administrative costs. This aims at strengthening the DRDAs and make them more professional in managing the anti-poverty programmes and be an effective link between the ministry and the district level.

Rural development and poverty alleviation programmes are implemented on a decentralised basis, keeping in view the large geographical areas, the administrative requirements and the need to involve grassroots-level officials and the community in the implementation of the programmes. At the central level the Ministry of Rural Areas &amp; Employment has been implementing these programmes. The Ministry is responsible for the release of central share of funds, policy formulation, overall guidance, monitoring and evaluation of the programmes. At the State level Prl Secretary, Rural Development and the Commissioner of Rural Development are overall incharge for implementation of the rural development programmes. At the District level, the programmes are implemented through the DRDAs (District Rural Development Agencies). The governing body of DRDA includes Members of Parliament (MPs), Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs), District level officials of Development Departments, Bankers, NGO's and representatives of weaker sections of the society. The District Collector used to be (but not always at present) the Chairman of the Governing Board. The Governing body at the district level provides guidance and directions to DRDA. The body in DRDA responsible for actual implementation is headed by an Additional District Collector.

Many Schemes of the Central and State Governments are introduced from time to time. Several schemes are available providing support to different components of Rural Development. Schemes are also periodically modified to reflect the experience over the years. The task of DRDA has been to identify the needs of the rural population and reach the appropriate schemes where they are needed. In implementing the schemes, the role of the DRDA has been Technical, Managerial and Financial. Thus DRDA is not only a body to disburse the funds for the schemes but also provide appropriate Managerial and Technical support.

'''District Rural Development Agencies''' (DRDAs) are [[district]] level development execution and monitoring agencies created under the [[Indian Societies Registration Act]].  Substantial sums of rural development funds of [[government]] of India were transferred and routed through them under various Centrally Sponsored
Schemes. From purely a financial resource from Rural Development point of view the DRDAs are extremely important institutions at the district level.{{Citation ne
eded|date=January 2009}} kalyan kumar

==Context of decentralization ==
With the adoption of the Constitutional mandate for [[decentralization]] of powers that privileged those self-government institutions in [[planning]] for [[economic development]] and social justice, the proposal to re-think the status of DRDAs and also to merge them with the [[panchayats]] had emerged. Under the section on 'devoluton of functionaries' the 1st Round Table had adopted a resolution, number IV(i), for reconceiving the role of District Rural Development Agencies (DRDAs). DRDAs were to be progressively merged with the District Panchayats and their technical expertise made available to all tiers of Panchayats.

At an all India level, the progress reported in this regard is far from satisfactory. There are some vexed issues, one among which is the 'reported' reluctance on the part of some of the institutions of Union Government for the proposal of merger of DRDAs with the district Panchayats. The complete merger seems to have happened only in [[Kerala]] and [[Karnataka]]. The latter has a much longer history of doing this. In both the States the DRDAs function as if they were the cells for poverty alleviation/ rural development schemes within the Zilla Panchayats.

[[West Bengal]] is reported to have taken similar steps; yet, it does not measure up to the yardstick of complete merger. Rajasthan and Lakshadweep State/ UT Profile make a similar assertion; this report is unable to confirm this.

==Status of DRDAs in the States==
In 10 States/ UTs the DRDAs continue to be separate with the only linkage established with the ZPs is making the President of ZP the Chairperson of the DRDA. These are Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha , Punjab, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Lakshadweep. In Gujarat the District Development Officer, who is also the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Panchayat, continues to chair the DRDA. In nine States/ UTs either the Collector continues as the Chair or some other arrangement has been made in this regard. These are Assam, Goa, Haryana, Jharkhand, Manipur, Tamil Nadu, Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli, Daman &amp; Diu, and Pondicherry. Andhra Pradesh has made the Zilla Panchayat President the Chair of the DRDA while designating the Collector as the Executive Chairperson. Similarly, in Maharashtra,
while the President Zilla Panchayat is made the Chair of the DRDA, the Chief Executive Officer of the Zilla Panchayat is designated as the Executive Chairman of the Management Committee.&lt;ref&gt;See The state of panchayats : 2007-08 , An independent assessment, Volume I : Thematic reports P 55&lt;/ref&gt;

A key goal in [[education reform]] in many states is excellence and equity. Education leaders such as Washington's Terry Bergeson have stated that these goals are necessary to build in which all students earn a [[meaningful high school diploma]]. These goals will break the link between race, poverty and insufficient academic achievement. Standards-based testing has forced face the facts about low achievement. Graduation requirements requiring passing rigorous tests continue to be a spur to action to address and remove those inequities.&lt;ref&gt; Terry Bergeson, "Not letting kids off the hook in math", March 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Science Education Standards]] also name excellence and equity as key goals.

The '''Federal Home Loan Bank Act''', {{USStatute|72|304|47|725|1932|07|22}}, is a [[United States federal law]] passed under President [[Herbert Hoover]] in order to lower the cost of home ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=23176 |title= Herbert Hoover: "Statement About Signing the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.," July 22, 1932 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; It established the [[Federal Home Loan Bank Board]] to charter and supervise federal [[savings and loan]] institutions.  It also created the [[Federal Home Loan Bank]]s which lend to building and loan associations, cooperative banks, homestead associations, insurance companies, savings banks, community development financial institutions, and insured depository institutions in order to finance home [[mortgage loan|mortgage]]s.

==Amendments==
===Successful===
The act was notably amended by [[Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989]], which transferred regulation of [[Savings and loan association|thrift]]s to the [[Office of Thrift Supervision]].

===Proposed===
On November 21, 2013, Rep. [[Steve Stivers]] introduced the bill [[To amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to authorize privately insured credit unions to become members of a Federal home loan bank (H.R. 3584; 113th Congress)]] into the [[United States House of Representatives]].&lt;ref name=3584sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 3584 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3584|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill would amend the Federal Home Loan Bank Act to treat certain privately insured [[credit union]]s as insured depository institutions for purposes of determining eligibility for membership in a federal home loan bank.&lt;ref name="3584sum"/&gt; The bill was scheduled to be voted on under a [[suspension of the rules]] on May 6, 2014.&lt;ref name=HouseExIRS&gt;{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=The week ahead: House to hold ex-IRS official in contempt|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/205099-the-week-ahead-house-to-hold-ex-irs-official-in-contempt|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''flag of [[Luxembourg]]''' ({{lang-lb|Lëtzebuerger Fändel}}, {{lang-de|Flagge Luxemburgs}}, {{lang-fr|Drapeau du Luxembourg}}) consists of three horizontal stripes, red, white and blue, and can be in 1:2 or 3:5 ratio. It was first used between 1845 and 1848 and officially adopted on 23 June 1972.

Luxembourg had no flag until 1830, when patriots were urged to display the national colours. The flag was defined as a horizontal tricolour of red, white, and blue in 1848, but it was not officially adopted until 1972. The tricolour flag is almost identical to [[Flag of the Netherlands|that of the Netherlands]], except that it is longer and its blue stripe and red stripe are a lighter shade.  The red, white, and blue colours were derived from the coat of arms of the [[House of Luxembourg]].

==History==
The colours of the flag of Luxembourg were first adopted around 1830 during the [[Belgian Revolution]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} They were probably derived from the [[County of Luxembourg|counts, dukes and later grand-dukes of Luxembourg]]'s [[Coat of arms of Luxembourg|coat of arms]] which in turn was derived  from the combination of the [[Duchy of Limburg|dukes of Limbourg]]'s [[Lion (heraldry)|Lion]] and the supposed striped [[banner]] of the early counts of Luxembourg.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} The three-colored horizontal design was fixed on 12 June 1845.

It took until 23 June 1972 before a law was passed regulating the flag of Luxembourg.  The same law also prescribed ensign and roundel for aircraft and ships registered in Luxembourg.

One important clarification brought by this law was that the color blue was defined as being a very bright blue, in contrast to the [[flag of the Netherlands]] (exactly the same design, but the Dutch flag uses dark blue and a less [[Rectangle|oblong]] shape).

The [[heraldry|heraldric]] [[blazon]] for the flag is ''per fess Gules and Azure, a fess Argent''.

==Ensign==
The red lion is the official ensign for ships registered in Luxembourg. It is used for river and sea shipping, as well as for [[civil air ensign|aviation]]. This flag is based on the [[coat of arms of Luxembourg]] (a [[banner of arms]]) and is used as the ensign to avoid the possibility of Luxembourg's ensign being confused for that of the Netherlands.  Ten white and blue stripes serve as the field for a red lion with a yellow tongue, claws and crown. The proper ratio for this ensign is 5:7.

The ''Réglement Grand-Ducal'' of 27 July 1993 defined the ensign's colours as follows:{{refn|Règlement grand-ducal du 27 juillet 1993 précisant la composition chromatique des couleurs du drapeau national luxembourgeois et du pavillon de la batellerie et de l’aviation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1993/0073/a073.pdf Memorial, A, number 73, of 16 September 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Flag change debate==
[[File:Flag of the Netherlands.svg|200px|thumb|right|Flag of the Netherlands]]
The resemblance of the Luxembourgish flag with the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]] has given rise to a national debate to change it.

On 5 October 2006, [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Michel Wolter]] introduced a legislative proposition&lt;ref&gt;[http://initiativ-roudeleiw.lu/index.php?page=2 Initiativ Roude Léiw - de Roude Léiw als Fändel fir Lëtzebuerg - Proposition de loi - luxembourg luxemburg drapeau gesetz&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805203710/http://www.initiativ-roudeleiw.lu/index.php?page=2 |date=5 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the current red-white-blue national flag with the red lion ensign. He argued that the current flag was commonly confused with that of the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Netherlands]] and that the red lion on the other hand was more popular, more aesthetic and of greater historic value. Wolter also claimed he had personally discussed the matter with some three hundred people, most of whom expressed their support for his initiative. On the other hand, many national politicians (including leading members of Wolter's own [[Christian Social People's Party|CSV]]){{Who|date=January 2010}} and VIPs{{Who|date=January 2010}} have expressed astonishment in the local media concerning both the timing and necessity for such a change.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Wolter was supported in his initiative by the centre-right [[Alternative Democratic Reform Party|ADR]].

On 24 October 2006, a local initiative called ''Initiativ Roude Léiw'' ("Red Lion Initiative") held a press conference explaining their intention to support Wolter's project on a non-partisan basis.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Their first actions would include distribution of red lion bumper stickers, a petition and a poll. During sporting events like the [[Tour de France]] supporters for Luxembourg participants now overwhelmingly use the Ensign instead of the Flag.

In 2015, a citizen submitted a formal petition to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Luxembourg)|Chamber of Deputies]] to replace the current national flag with the ''Roude Léiw''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wort.lu/en/politics/petition-change-the-luxembourg-flag-55ba15ab0c88b46a8ce5d86e] [http://www.chd.lu/wps/portal/public/PetitionDetail?action=doPetitionDetail&amp;id=510]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Partitions of Luxembourg|For historic reasons]], the adjacent [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Belgian province of Luxembourg]] uses a flag that also features a [[Lion (heraldry)|lion]] superimposed on [[Bar (heraldry)|horizontal stripes]]. Elsewhere, similar designs can also be found, for instance in the Belgian city of [[Bruges]] and the [[German state]] of [[Hesse]].

=== Two Civil official flags ===
On 6 July 2007, the Government stated that the ''Roude Léiw'' would be accepted as a Civil flag only within the territory of the Grand-Duchy along with the National flag keeping the same proportions, i.e. 1:2 or 3:5 as the National flag to avoid confusion with the Civil ensign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouvernement.lu/salle_presse/conseils_de_gouvernement/2007/07/06conseil/index.html#1 Proposition de loi N°5617 du député Michel Wolter (CSV) portant modification de la loi du 23 juin 1972 sur les emblèmes nationaux], ''Gouvernement du Luxembourg'', 17 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''German East Africa''' ({{lang-de|Deutsch-Ostafrika}}) (GEA) was a [[German colonial empire|German colony]] in the [[African Great Lakes]] region, which included present-day [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]], and the mainland part of [[Tanzania]]. GEA's area was {{convert|994996|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=History of East Africa, Volume 2 | author=Roland Anthony Oliver | editor1=Vincent Todd Harlow | editor2=[[Elizabeth Millicent Chilver]] | editor3=Alison Smith | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | year=1976 | page= | isbn=9780198227137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o48gnQAACAAJ | title=German Africa: A Selected Annotated Bibliography | author1=[[Jon Bridgman]] | author2=David E.

The colony was organised when the German military was asked in the late 1880s to put down a revolt against the activities of the [[German East Africa Company]]. It ended with [[German Empire|Imperial Germany]]'s defeat in [[World War I]]. Ultimately, GEA was divided between Britain and Belgium and was reorganised as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandate of the League of Nations]].

==History==
{{Main|German East Africa Company|Abushiri revolt}}

Like other colonial powers, the Germans expanded their empire in the Africa Great Lakes region, ostensibly to fight slavery and the slave trade. Unlike other imperial powers, however, they never formally abolished either, preferring instead to curtail the production of new "recruits" and regulate the existing slaving business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Emancipation without Abolition in German East Africa, C. 1884–1914 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x--N5q0AH84C | author=Jan-Georg Deutsch | year=2006 | publisher=[[James Currey]] | pages= | accessdatw= | isbn=978-0-852-55986-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

The colony began when [[Carl Peters]], an adventurer who founded the [[Society for German Colonization]], signed treaties with several native chieftains on the mainland opposite [[Zanzibar]]. On 3 March 1885, the German government announced that it had granted an imperial charter, which was signed by Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] on 27 February 1885. The charter was granted to Peters' company and was intended to establish a [[protectorate]] in the [[African Great Lakes]] region. Peters then recruited specialists who began exploring south to the [[Rufiji River]] and north to [[Witu, Kenya|Witu]], near [[Lamu]] on the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B02hIAIrsEgC | title=Carl Peters and German Imperialism 1856-1918: A Political Biography | author=Arne Perras | year=2004 | publisher=[[Clarendon Press]] | pages= | accessdate= | isbn=9780199265107 | oclc=252667062}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=650184 | title=Domestic Origins of Germany's Colonial Expansion under Bismarck | author=Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann | journal=[[Past &amp; Present (journal)|Past &amp; Present]] | date=February 1969 | issue=42 | pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dRheDbkmigIC | title=The Imperialist Imagination: German Colonialism and Its Legacy | author1=Sara Friedrichsmeyer | author2=Sara Lennox | author3=Susanne Zantop | publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] | year=1998 | isbn=9780472066827 | oclc=39679479}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

The [[Sultan of Zanzibar]] protested, claiming that he was the ruler of both Zanzibar and the mainland. Chancellor Bismarck then sent five warships, which arrived on 7 August 1885 and trained their guns on the Sultan's palace. The British and Germans agreed to divide the mainland between themselves, and the Sultan had no option but to agree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q-aoZQ-o7aQC | title=Remembering Africa: The Rediscovery of Colonialism in Contemporary German Literature | author=Dirk Göttsche | year=2013 | publisher=[[Camden House]] | page= | accessdate= | isbn=9781571135469}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2018}}

Between 1891 and 1894, the [[Hehe people]], led by [[Chief Mkwawa]], resisted German expansion. They were defeated because rival tribes supported the Germans.

German colonial administrators relied heavily on native chiefs to keep order and collect taxes. By 1 January 1914, aside from local police, the military garrisons of the ''[[Schutztruppe]]n'' (protective troops) at Dar es Salaam, [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]], [[Iringa Urban District|Iringa]], and Mahenge numbered 110 German officers (including 42 medical officers), 126 non-commissioned officers, and 2,472 [[Askari]] (native enlisted men).&lt;ref name="Haupt"&gt;{{cite book | author=Werner Haupt | title=Deutschlands Schutzgebiete in Übersee 1884–1918 | location=Friedberg | publisher=Podzun-Pallas Verlag | year=1984 | isbn=3-7909-0204-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32}}

==Economic development==
Germans promoted commerce and economic growth. Over {{convert|100,000|acre|ha}} were put under [[sisal]] cultivation, which was the largest cash crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/980426986 | title=BRITISH AND GERMAN EAST AFRICA: their economic commercial relations (classic reprint) | first=H. | last=BRODE | year=2016 | publisher=FORGOTTEN BOOKS | isbn=1330527461 | location=[S.l.] | oclc=980426986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two million coffee trees were planted, rubber trees grew on {{convert|200,000|acre|ha}}, and there were large cotton plantations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zum.de/psm/imperialismus/kolonialatlas05/atlas011e.php3|title=(HIS,P) Deutscher Kolonial-Atlas mit Jahrbuch (Atlas German Colonies, with Yearbook), edited by the German Colonial Society, 1905 - Deutsch-Ostafrika|website=www.zum.de|access-date=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To bring these agricultural products to market, beginning in 1888, the [[Usambara Railway]] was built from [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] to Moshi. The [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Railroad]] covered {{convert|775|mi}} and linked Dar es Salaam, [[Morogoro]], [[Tabora]], and [[Kigoma]]. The final link to the eastern shore of [[Lake Tanganyika]] was completed in July 1914 and was cause for a huge and festive celebration in the capital with an agricultural fair and trade exhibition. Harbor facilities were built or improved with electrical cranes, with rail access and warehouses. Wharves were remodeled at Tanga, Bagamoyo, and [[Lindi]]. In 1912, Dar es Salaam and Tanga received 356 freighters and passenger steamers and over 1,000 coastal ships and local trading-vessels.&lt;ref name="Haupt"/&gt;{{rp|30}} Dar es Salaam became the showcase city of all of tropical Africa.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite web | author=Charles Miller | title=''Battle for the Bundu, The First World War in East Africa'' | location= New York City | publisher=MacMillan Publishing Co., Inc. | year=1974 | isbn=0-02-584930-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}} By 1914, Dar es Salaam and the surrounding province had a population of 166,000, among them 1,000 Germans.

Gold mining in Tanzania in modern times dates back to the German colonial period, beginning with gold discoveries near [[Lake Victoria]] in 1894. The Kironda-Goldminen-Gesellschaft established one of the first gold mines in the colony, the [[Sekenke Gold Mine]], which began operation in 1909 after the finding of gold there in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tanzaniagold.com/tanzania_mining_history.html Tanzania Mining History] {{webarchive | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814071423/http://www.tanzaniagold.com/tanzania_mining_history.html | date=14 August 2010}} tanzaniagold.com, retrieved 24 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Germany developed an educational program for Africans that included elementary, secondary, and vocational schools.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} "Instructor qualifications, curricula, textbooks, teaching materials, all met standards unmatched anywhere in tropical Africa."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;{{rp|21}} In 1924, ten years after the beginning of the First World War and six years into British rule, the visiting American [[Phelps Stokes Fund#Work in Africa|Phelps-Stokes Commission]] reported, "In regards to schools, the Germans have accomplished marvels. Some time must elapse before education attains the standard it had reached under the Germans."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;{{rp|21}}

The [[Swahili language|Swahili]] word "shule" means school and has been borrowed from the German word "schule".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://glosbe.com/sw/goh/shule | title=shule - Swahili-Old High German (ca. 750-1050) Dictionary | publisher=Glosbe | language=en | accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population on the eve of World War I==
In the most populous colony of the German Empire, there were more than 7.5 million locals compared to around 10,000 Europeans, who resided mainly in coastal locations and official residences. In 1913, only 882 German farmers and planters lived in the colony. About 70,000 Africans worked on the plantations of GEA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Die deutschen Kolonien | last=Längin | first=Bernd G. | year=2005 | isbn=3-8132-0854-0 | location=Mittler | page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I==
{{main|East African Campaign (World War I)}}

[[File:German WW1 Memorial in Iringa.jpg|thumb|WWI Memorial in [[Iringa]], [[Tanzania]].]]

General [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], who had served in [[German South West Africa]] and [[Kamerun]], led the German military in GEA during World War I. His military consisted of 3,500 Europeans and 12,000 native Askaris and porters. Their war strategy was to harry the British/Imperial army of 40,000, which was at times commanded by the former [[Second Boer War]] commander [[Jan Smuts]]. One of Lettow-Vorbeck's greatest victories was at the [[Battle of Tanga]] (3–5 November 1914), where German forces defeated a British force more than eight times larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/7732627 | title=Guerilla: Colonel von Lettow-Vorbeck and Germany's East African Empire | author=Edwin P. Hoyt | publisher=Macmillan | location=New York | year=1981 | isbn=0025552104 | oclc=7732627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lettow-Vorbeck's [[guerrilla warfare]] compelled Britain to commit significant resources to a minor colonial theatre throughout the war and inflicted more than 10,000 casualties. Eventually, the weight of numbers, especially after forces coming from the [[Belgian Congo]] had attacked from the west (Battle of Tabora), and dwindling supplies forced Lettow-Vorbeck to abandon the colony. He withdrew south into [[Portuguese Mozambique]], then into [[Northern Rhodesia]] where he agreed to a ceasefire three days after the end of the war after receiving news of the armistice between the warring nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646068752 | title=The Boers in East Africa: ethnicity and identity | author=Brian M.

Lettow-Vorbeck was acclaimed after the war as one of Germany's heroes. His ''Schutztruppe'' was celebrated as the only colonial German force during World War I that was not defeated in open combat, although they often retreated when outnumbered. The Askari colonial troops that had fought in the East African campaign were later given pension payments by the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52200068 | title=Warfare in World History | author=Michael S.

The [[SMS Königsberg (1905)|SMS ''Königsberg'']], a German [[light cruiser]], also fought off the coast of the African Great Lakes region. She was eventually scuttled in the Rufiji delta in July 1915 after running low on coal and spare parts, and was subsequently blockaded and bombarded by the British. The surviving crew stripped out the remaining ship's guns and mounted them on gun carriages, before joining the land forces, adding considerably to their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60281302 | title=A naval history of World War I | author=Paul G.

Another and smaller campaign was conducted on the shores of southern Lake Tanganyika over 1914–15. This involved a makeshift British and Belgian flotilla, and the ''Reichsheer'' garrison at Bismarckburg (modern day [[Kasanga]]).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Break-up of the colony==
The Supreme Council of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] awarded all of German East Africa (GEA) to Britain on 7 May 1919, over the strenuous objections of Belgium.&lt;ref name= "Ends"/&gt;{{rp|240}} The British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|colonial secretary]], [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Alfred Milner]], and Belgium's minister [[plenipotentiary]] to the conference, [[:fr:Pierre Orts|Pierre Orts]], then negotiated the Anglo-Belgian agreement of 30 May 1919&lt;ref name="Belgium"/&gt;{{rp|618–9}} where Britain ceded the north-western GEA provinces of [[Ruanda-Urundi|Ruanda and Urundi]] to Belgium.&lt;ref name="Ends"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQnpQNKeKKAC&amp;pg=PA246 | title=Ends of British Imperialism: The Scramble for Empire, Suez, and Decolonization | first=William Roger | last=Louis | publisher=[[I.B.

On 12 July 1919, the Commission on Mandates agreed that the small [[Kionga Triangle]] south of the [[Rovuma River]] would be given to [[Portugal]],&lt;ref name= "Ends"/&gt;{{rp|243}} with it eventually becoming part of independent [[Mozambique]]. The commission reasoned that Germany had virtually forced Portugal to cede the triangle in 1894.&lt;ref name= "Ends"/&gt;{{rp|243}}

The [[Treaty of Versailles]] was signed on 28 July 1919, although the treaty did not take effect until 10 January 1920. On that date, the GEA was transferred officially to Britain, Belgium, and Portugal. Also on that date, "[[Tanganyika Territory|Tanganyika]]" became the name of the British territory.

==German placenames==
Most place names in German East Africa continued to bear German spellings of the local names, such as "Udjidji" for [[Ujiji]] and "Kilimandscharo" for [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], as well as German translations of some local phrases, such as "Kleinaruscha" for Arusha-Chini and "Neu-Moschi" for the city now known as [[Moshi, Tanzania|Moshi]]. ([[Kigoma]] was known for a time as "Rutschugi".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25748614|title=Histoire sociale de l'Afrique de l'Est (XIXe-XXe siècle) : actes du colloque de Bujumbura, 17-24 octobre 1989.|date=1991|publisher=Karthala|others=Université du Burundi.

== Planned symbols for German East Africa ==
{{Main Article|Coats of arms of German colonies}}
In 1914 a series of drafts were made for proposed Coat of Arms and Flags for the [[German colonial empire|German Colonies]]. However, [[World War I]] broke out before the designs were finished and implemented and the symbols were never actually taken into use. Following the defeat in the war, Germany lost all its colonies and the prepared coat of arms and flags were therefore never used.

'''Guido Salvini''' (born 1954) is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[judge]], based in [[Milan]]. He issued [[European arrest warrant]]s in 2005 against approximatively 20 [[CIA]] agents accused of having taken part in the abduction of Abu Omar, the Egyptian cleric in Milan in 2003. The case is known in Italy as the ''[[Imam Rapito affair]]''. Before that, Guido Salvini was in charge of investigations, since July 1988, concerning Italy's [[strategy of tension]] during the 1970s.

==2000s==
According to Rome prosecutor, Pietro Salvitti, quoted by ''[[La Repubblica]]'', Guido Salvini was one of the targets of a "network" which  aimed at slamdering various political opponents of [[Silvio Berlusconi]] via the [[Mitrokhin Commission]], headed by senator [[Paolo Guzzanti]], by claiming they worked for or were manipulated by the [[KGB]], the former intelligence agency of the [[Soviet Union]], dissolved in 1991. These targets included former Prime minister [[Romano Prodi]], his staff, General Giuseppe Cucchi (current director of the [[CESIS]]), Milan prosecutor Armando Spataro, also in charge of the "Imam Rapito" case, as well as ''La Repubblica'' reporters Carlo Bonini and Giuseppe D'Avanzo, who discovered the [[Yellowcake forgery]] manipulations. This network includes, according to Salvitti, [[Mario Scaramella]], [[Nicolò Pollari]], head of [[SISMI]] intelligence agency indicted in the ''Imam Rapito'' affair, [[Marco Mancini]], n°2 of SISMI arrested in July 2006 for the same reason, as well as [[Robert Lady]], CIA station chief in Milan also indicted in the kidnapping of Abu Omar in Milan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repubblica.it/2007/01/sezioni/cronaca/caso-scaramella/caso-scaramella/caso-scaramella.html Il falso dossier di Scaramella - "Così la Russia manipola Prodi"], ''[[La Repubblica]]'', 11 January 2007 {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy of tension==
Guido Salvini started investigating events relating to Italy's [[strategy of tension]], which have involved a [[NATO]] [[stay-behind]] anti-communist network known as [[Operation Gladio|Gladio]], in July 1988. After 463 interrogations, the investigations produced 60,000 pages. He indicted in 1998 [[David Carrett]], officer of the US Navy, on charges of political and military espionage as well as participation in the 1969 [[Piazza Fontana bombing]]. He also indicted Sergio Minetto, Italian official member of Gladio, and ''[[pentito]]'' Carlo Digilio, indicted in the Piazza Fontana investigation. The neofascists had decided to kill Mariano Rumor, on retaliation against his decision not to proclaim the [[state of emergency]] following the Piazza Fontana bombing &amp;mdash; which, according to neo-fascist [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]], was one of the main objectives of this bombing.&lt;ref name="La Repubblica"&gt;{{cite news | title=Strage di Piazza Fontana spunta un agente USA | publisher=[[La Repubblica]] | date=February 11, 1998 | accessdate=2007-02-20 | url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/fontana/fontana/fontana.html|language=it}} (With original documents, including juridical sentences and the report of the Italian Commission on Terrorism)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hellenic Coast Guard''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] '''Λιμενικό Σώμα-Ελληνική Ακτοφυλακή''' &amp;ndash; ''Limeniko Soma-Elliniki Aktofylaki'' &amp;ndash; lit. "Port Corps-Hellenic Coast Guard") is the national [[coast guard]] of [[Greece]]. Like many other coast guards, it is a [[paramilitary]] organization that can support the [[Hellenic Navy]] in wartime, but resides under separate civilian control in times of peace. It was founded in 1919 by an Act of Parliament (N. 1753/1919) and the legal framework for its function was reformed in 1927. The current name is specified in Law 3022/2011.

==Organization==
[[File:Hellenic Coast Guard Flag.svg|left|thumb|200px|Old [[ensign]] of the Hellenic Coast Guard (in use 1964-1980)]]

The Hellenic Coast Guard Force is currently under the authority of the [[Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy (Greece)|Ministry of Shipping and Island Policy]]. The Hellenic Coast Guard Force is headed by the Senior Coast Guard Officer who has the rank of [[vice admiral]] (''[[Antinavarchos]]'').

The basic roles of the Hellenic Coast Guard are [[maritime law enforcement|law enforcement at sea]], [[search and rescue]], [[marine safety]], preventing [[sea pollution]], [[fisheries patrol]]ling, preventing [[illegal immigration]] and [[drug interdiction]].

In order to perform these roles, the Coast Guard operate a number of [[patrol boat]]s of various sizes (6m to 60m) and different types ([[rigid inflatable boat|RIBs]], coastal patrol boats, offshore patrol boats, [[lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]]s and [[pollution control]] vessels). On land the Hellenic Coast Guard is equipped with cars and motorcycles.

The Hellenic Coast Guard operates the Maritime Rescue Coordination Center (MRCC) in [[Piraeus]] and the Emergency Radio Communications Station ''SXE'' at [[Aspropyrgos]] ({{coord|38|02|12.5|N|23|35|7.5|E}}). The Hellenic Coast Guard also operates the [[Vessel Traffic Service]] (V.T.M.I.S.) at busy sea lanes, currently around the ports of Piraeus, [[Elefsis]], [[Lavrion]] and [[Rafina]].

Between May 21, 1964 and 1980 the Hellenic Coast Guard had its own special flag, which was derived from the Greek Ensign with the addition of the crossed anchors badge on the center of the white cross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yen.gr/media/28417/simaials_small.jpg|title=Photo of old Hellenic CG flag.|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003070119/http://www.yen.gr/media/28417/simaials_small.jpg|archivedate=3 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role and responsibilities ==
The main activities of the Hellenic Coast Guard are defined in the present legislation and specified within its institutional framework of operation. These activities are the following:
* Law enforcement at sea, ports and coastal areas. Prevention of illegal immigration. Surveillance of the sea, shipping, ports and borders.
* Search and rescue at sea (jointly with the [[Hellenic Air Force]], which is responsible for search and rescue by air).

* Port operations (excluding port pilots service).
&lt;!-- * Merchant Ships and Shipping Companies inspection --&gt;

==Personnel==
Most officers in recent years are graduates from higher education establishments, including the Merchant Marine Academies. After recruitment new officers study for one year at the [[Hellenic Naval Academy]]. Petty officers are trained for nine months at ''Palaskas Naval Training Centre'' and lower rank enlisted men are trained at ''Scholi Limenofylakon'' at Piraeus. With law Law 4029 of 2011, a volunteer Auxiliary Coast Guard was established.&lt;ref&gt;Law 4029, Government Gazette A 245, 2011-11-22&lt;/ref&gt; The Officers of the Hellenic Coast Guard have the same ranks as the Officers of the Hellenic Navy and similar insignia, replacing the curl with two crossed anchors. The Petty Officers (Ratings) also use rank insignia similar to those of the Hellenic Navy, replacing the speciality symbol with the crossed anchors badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://egov.yen.gr/Folder.2003-07-23.3052/Folder.2003-07-23.3919/diakritika.jpg|title=Grade/rank insignia of the Hellenic CG (Ministry of Merchant Marine)|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003070119/http://egov.yen.gr/Folder.2003-07-23.3052/Folder.2003-07-23.3919/diakritika.jpg|archivedate=3 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joann S. Peterson, M.S.W., A.C.S.W., Dip.C., Ph.D.''', (July 26, 1934 - January 9, 2007) was an American [[social worker]], [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counsellor]], [[author]] and [[lecturer]]. She taught seminars internationally, and was the first Director of Education at the [[Haven Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Wong|McKeen|2001|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and Professional Development==

Born premature and abandoned at birth, she struggled with physical developmental challenges as a child; she experienced chronic, unrelenting pain every day of her adult life.  Rather than succumb to a passive life of victimhood, she worked with her challenges, and excelled academically.  Her own experiences of suffering gave her particular insight and empathy for others with difficulties, and she was known as a caring, empathetic counsellor and teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Wong|McKeen|2001|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But she was also disciplined and rigorous, and expected her students to embrace personal responsibility without complaint, as she had done.&lt;ref name="McNally2002"&gt;{{Harv |McNally|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Peterson earned a B.A. at [[Willamette University]] (1956), [[Master's in Social Work|M.S.W.]] at [[University of Washington]] (1958), Dip.C. from the [[Haven Institute]] (1990) and Ph.D. from the ''Open International University'' (2000). She did some of the pioneering work in the field of [[child sex abuse]] in [[San Diego]], CA.  Later, she was a key figure in the development of [[mental health]] services in [[Bellingham Washington|Bellingham]], Washington.&lt;ref name="Long1982"&gt;{{Harv |Long|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left private clinical practice to assume the position of Director of Education at the [[Haven Institute]] on [[Gabriola Island, British Columbia|Gabriola Island]], B.C. Canada in 1990, and held this position until her death in early 2007.&lt;ref name="McKeen2001"&gt;{{Harv |Wong|McKeen|2001|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peterson developed and led a wide variety of groups for ''The Haven''. She collaborated with [[Bennet Wong]] and [[Jock McKeen]] for over thirty years.&lt;ref name="McKeen2001" /&gt; She facilitated personal and professional development seminars throughout North America and Southeast Asia .  Her last book was translated into Chinese in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Allen|2005|p=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions==

===Child Sex Abuse===

[[Abused]] in her adoptive family, she had a special affection and ability with youngsters who were undergoing [[physical abuse|physical]], [[emotional abuse|emotional]] or [[sexual abuse|sexual]] abuse. She wrote about her experiences, and contributed much to the field in this domain. She taught seminars for individuals and couples in the area of [[human sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Merlin|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family Therapy===

Her clinical work focused on families in crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Herald|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She served as a consultant for agencies and trained professionals in [[psychology]] and [[social work]] for over 40 years. She authored numerous articles, and wrote many research grants in the field of [[child abuse]] prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Campbell|2005|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responsible Anger===

Peterson authored two books and a DVD about responsible anger expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Best|2006|}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the ''Anger, Boundaries and Safety'' workshop she developed and led over 15 years, her writing on anger emphasizes the benefits to physical and [[mental health]], and to relationships, of the non-violent, boundaried expression of anger.&lt;ref name="Long1982" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Izzard|2003|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Dialogue===

In her work, she was always focussed on helping individuals and families to come into human [[dialogue]] with each other, overcoming the distances created by [[objectification]]. She wrote and taught about separation and loss, [[Mirroring (psychology)|mirroring]], boundaries and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Lemon|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; She designed an experiential workshop entitled "Disengaging Depression" which was based on her staunch belief that people can overcome psychological and physical difficulties through courage and personal responsibility.&lt;ref name="McNally2002" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Nicholls|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Allen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation| Violence abounds, both at the micro and macro level. In relationships, and in communities and countries around the world, people are living out violence and naming it anger. This is evident in the blatant, abhorrent behaviors that are intended to be retaliative, to do harm, and to control. In this violence people are turned into labels, roles and objects, and contact with the person is lost. An enemy is created. Paranoia grows, and our humanity suffers an erosion at the level of the soul. Ultimately we distance from our evolutionary energy of human connection. And in this disconnection we experience an acute, pervasive loneliness and isolation.
|Joann Peterson&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv |Peterson|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''LGBT rights''' in [[Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha]] have gradually evolved over the years. Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is banned in the entire territory through the ''Constitution Order 2009'' and [[same-sex marriage]] has been legal on the islands since 2017.&lt;ref name="CProtection"&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2009/1751/schedule/made The St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination protections==
The ''St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009'' bans discrimination based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="CProtection" /&gt;

==Adoption and parenting==
Under the ''Saint Helena Welfare of Children Ordinance 2010'' (which applies to Saint Helena and Tristan da Cunha) and the ''Ascension Island Child Welfare Ordinance 2011'' (which applies to Ascension Island), only married couples may adopt. Same-sex couples may marry in the territory, therefore they also have the right to adopt. Local agencies, in the case of an adoption, follow the letter of the law with the best interest and the views of the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sainthelena.gov.sh/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Welfare-of-Children-Ord-310712.pdf WELFARE OF CHILDREN ORDINANCE]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascension-island.gov.ac/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Child-Welfare-Ordinance-20111.pdf CHILD WELFARE ORDINANCE 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2006 UK Government report, there have been no adoptions in Saint Helena or Ascension Island for many years.&lt;ref&gt;UNITED KINGDOM OVERSEAS TERRITORIES AND CROWN DEPENDENCIES, "This report sets out the progress made in the UK’s Overseas Territories and Crown Dependencies in implementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child since 1999, ''OHCHR''&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lord-lieutenant''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɛ|f|ˈ|t|ɛ|n|ə|n|t}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lieutenant?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=Collins Dictionary|title=Definition: Lieutenant|accessdate=31 December 2014|date=n.d.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402115444/http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/lieutenant?showCookiePolicy=true|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the British monarch's personal representative in each county of the United Kingdom. Historically, each lieutenant was responsible for organising the county's [[militia]]. In 1871, the lieutenant's responsibility over the local militia was removed. However, it was not until 1921 that they formally lost the right to call upon able-bodied men to fight when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Lieutenancy|url=http://www.surreylieutenancy.org/historyofthelieu.html|website=www.surreylieutenancy.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903205010/http://www.surreylieutenancy.org/historyofthelieu.html|archivedate=3 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord-lieutenant is now an honorary titular position usually awarded to a retired notable person in the county.

==Origins==

===England and Wales===
Lieutenants were first appointed to a number of [[Historic counties of England|English counties]] by [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] in the 1540s, when the military functions of the [[sheriff]] were handed over to him. He raised and was responsible for the efficiency of the local [[militia]] units of the county, and afterwards of the [[yeomanry]], and volunteers. He was commander of these forces, whose officers he appointed.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|title=Lieutenant|volume=16|page=599|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri16chisrich#page/599/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; These commissions were originally of temporary duration, and only when the situation required the local militia to be specially supervised and well prepared; often where invasion by [[Scotland]] or France might be expected.

Lieutenancies soon became more organised, probably in the reign of his successor [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], their establishment being approved by the English parliament in 1550. However, it was not until the threat of invasion by the forces of Spain in 1585 that lieutenants were appointed to all counties and [[county corporate|counties corporate]] and became in effect permanent. Although some counties were left without lieutenants during the 1590s, following the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]], the office continued to exist, and was retained by [[James VI and I|King James I]] even after the end of the [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]].

The office was abolished under the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]], but was re-established following the [[The Restoration|Restoration]] under the [[City of London Militia Act 1662]], which declared that:

{{quote|[T]he King's most Excellent Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, shall and may from Time to Time, as Occasion shall require, issue forth several Commissions of Lieutenancy to such Persons as his Majesty, his Heirs and Successors, shall think fit to be his Majesty's Lieutenants for the several and respective Counties, Cities and Places of England and Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed.}}

Although not explicitly stated, from that date lieutenants were appointed to "counties at large", with their jurisdiction including the counties corporate within the parent county.&lt;ref name=webb&gt;{{cite book |last1=Webb |first1=Sidney |authorlink1= Sidney Webb |last2=Webb |first2=Beatrice |authorlink2= Beatrice Webb |title=English Local Government from the Revolution to the Municipal Corporations Act |chapter=1: The Parish and the County | date=1906 |publisher= [[Longman|Longman's Green and Co.]] |location= London |pages= 283&amp;ndash;287}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, lieutenants of Devon in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries appointed [[deputy lieutenant]]s to the City of Exeter, and were sometimes described as the "Lieutenant of Devon and Exeter"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=67116 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526060600/https://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=67116 |archivedate= 2011-05-26 |title= The city of Exeter: Commissions, pardons etc |accessdate= 2009-01-29 |author= Historical Manuscripts Commission |year=1916 |work= Report on the Records of the City of Exeter |publisher= British History Online }}&lt;/ref&gt; The one exception was [[Haverfordwest]], to which a lieutenant continued to be appointed until 1974. The origin of this anomaly may have lain in the former [[county palatine|palatine]] status of Pembrokeshire.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;

The [[City of London]] was uniquely given a commission of lieutenancy, and was exempt from the authority of the lieutenant of Middlesex. The [[Constable of the Tower of London]] and the [[Warden of the Cinque Ports]] were ''[[ex-officio]]'' lieutenants for the [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]] and [[Cinque Ports]] respectively, which were treated as counties in legislation regarding lieutenancy and militia affairs.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt;

The official title of the office at this time was His or Her Majesty's "Lieutenant for the county of x", but as almost all office-holders were [[peers of the realm]], they were referred to as "Lord-Lieutenant".

===Ireland===
''An Act to make the Militia of this Kingdom more useful'' (Geo 2, c.9) was passed by the [[Parliament of Ireland]] in 1715. This provided for the issuing of commissions to appoint persons as "his Majesty's lieutenant or lieutenants, governor or governors, and commissioners of array for the several and respective counties, cities, and places of Ireland". The lieutenants were empowered to embody militia regiments.  When the [[Irish Free State]] became independent of the UK in 1922, British rule ceased to exist.

===Northern Ireland===
In 1921, with the establishment of [[Northern Ireland]], lord lieutenants continued to be appointed through the Governor of Northern Ireland to the six counties and two county boroughs. In 1973 the counties and county boroughs were abolished as local government units in Northern Ireland, and lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the Queen to "counties and county boroughs... as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973".

===Scotland===
Although [[Colin Lindsay, 3rd Earl of Balcarres|Colin, Earl of Balcarres]] was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Fife in 1688,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lindsay, Colin|first=Thomas Finlayson|last=Henderson|volume=33|pages=286–288}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lieutenants were appointed to a few counties from about 1715, it was not until 1794 that permanent lieutenancies were established by [[Warrant (law)|Royal Warrant]]. By the [[Militia Act 1797]],&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act 1797 (37 Geo.3, C.103)&lt;/ref&gt; the lieutenants appointed "for the Counties, Stewartries, Cities, and Places" were given powers to raise and command county militia units.

The [[Lord Provost]]s of [[Edinburgh]], Glasgow, [[Aberdeen]], and [[Dundee]] are, by virtue of office, also the lord-lieutenant of their respective city.

While in their lieutenancies, lord-lieutenants are among the few individuals in Scotland officially permitted to fly the banner of the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]], or "[[Royal Banner of Scotland|The Lion Rampant]]" as it is more commonly known.

==19th century==
The [[Militia Act 1802]]&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act 1802 (1802 c.90)&lt;/ref&gt; provided for the appointment of lieutenants to "Lieutenants for the Counties, Ridings, and Places" in England and Wales, and gave them command of the county militia. In the case of towns or cities which were [[county corporate|counties of themselves]], the "chief magistrate" (meaning the mayor, chief bailiff or other head of the corporation) had the authority to appoint deputy lieutenants in the absence of an appointment of a lieutenant by the crown. 
  
The [[Regulation of the Forces Act 1871]]&lt;ref&gt;Regulation of the Forces Act 1871 (1871 c.86) section 6&lt;/ref&gt; removed the lieutenant as head of the county militia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barry Dodd - Obituary |editor-last=Witherow|editor-first=John|work=The Times |issue=72556 |date=8 June 2018 |page=54|issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the jurisdiction, duties and command exercised by the lieutenant were revested in the crown, but the power of recommending for first appointments was reserved to the lieutenant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The [[Militia Act 1882]]&lt;ref&gt;Militia Act 1882 (1881 c.49) section 5&lt;/ref&gt; revested the jurisdiction of the lieutenants in the crown.

The lieutenancies were reestablished on a new basis by Section 29 of the 1882 Act which stated that "Her Majesty shall from time to time appoint lieutenants for the several counties in the United Kingdom". Counties for lieutenancy purposes were also redefined as "a county at large, with the exception that each riding of the county of [[Yorkshire|York]] shall be a separate county". The text of the [[letters patent]] appointing lieutenants under the act stated they were to be:

{{quote|...Our Lieutenant of and in the County of X and of all cities boroughs liberties places incorporated and privileged and other places whatsoever within the said county and the limits and precincts of the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law and Custom of the Constitution |last=Anson |first=William |authorlink=Sir William Anson, 3rd Baronet |volume=II: The Crown. Part I |year=1907 |publisher=[[University of Oxford]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= |page=264 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was a formal recognition of the situation that had existed since 1662 that the lieutenancies for the majority of counties corporate in England were held jointly with their associated county—for example a lieutenant was now appointed for "the County of Gloucester, and the City and County of Gloucester, and the City and County of City of Bristol".

Haverfordwest was permitted to retain a lieutenant while the Tower Hamlets and Cinque Ports were to continue to be regarded as counties for lieutenancy purposes.

From 1889 lieutenancy counties in England and [[Wales]] were to correspond to groupings of [[administrative county|administrative counties]] and [[county boroughs]] established by the [[Local Government Act 1888]]. The creation of a new [[County of London]] also led to the ending of the [[Tower division|Tower Hamlets]] lieutenancy. The Act also extinguished the lieutenancy of the Cinque Ports.

Section 69 of the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]] realigned the lieutenancy counties with the new administrative counties created by the Act. The one exception was [[County Tipperary]], which although administered by two [[county council]]s, was to remain united for lieutenancy. In contrast to the legislation in England and Wales, each [[county borough]] was to have its own lieutenant, and those [[county corporate|counties corporate]] not made county boroughs were abolished. The effect of this was to create a lieutenant for the county boroughs of [[Lord Lieutenant of Belfast|Belfast]] and [[Lord Lieutenant of the City of Londonderry|Londonderry]], and to abolish those for the city of [[Kilkenny]], borough of [[Drogheda]] and town of [[Galway]].

The office of lieutenant was honorary and held during the royal pleasure, but virtually for life. Appointment to the office is by letters-patent under the [[Great Seal of the Realm|great seal]]. Usually, though not necessarily, the person appointed lieutenant was also appointed [[custos rotulorum]] or keeper of the rolls. Appointments to the [[county bench]] of [[magistrate]]s were usually made on the recommendation of the lieutenant.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==20th century==
The [[Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907]]&lt;ref&gt;Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907(7 Edw.7 C.9)&lt;/ref&gt; established County Territorial Force Associations, of which the lieutenant was to be head, styled president of the [[county association]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; It restated the combination of counties and counties corporate as lieutenancy counties.

In 1921, with the establishment of [[Northern Ireland]], lieutenants continued to be appointed through the [[Governor of Northern Ireland]] to the six counties and two county boroughs. The creation of the [[Irish Free State]] in the following year saw the remaining county lieutenancies in Ireland abolished. In 1973 the counties and county boroughs were abolished as local government units in [[Northern Ireland]], and lord-lieutenants are now appointed directly by the sovereign to "counties and county boroughs... as defined for local government purposes immediately before 1 October 1973". In 1975 the term lord-lieutenant officially replaced that of lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973 (1973 c.36) section 36(5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Northern Ireland (Lieutenancy) Order 1975 S.I. 1975/156&lt;/ref&gt;

Local government reform in England in 1965 led to the appointment of lieutenants to [http://www.greaterlondonlieutenancy.com/ Greater London]&lt;ref&gt;Administration of Justice Act 1964 (1964 c.2) section 18&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Huntingdon and Peterborough]], and the abolition of those of the counties of [[County of London|London]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Huntingdonshire|Huntingdon]].

A more fundamental reform of local government throughout England and [[Wales]] (outside [[Greater London]]) created a new structure of metropolitan, non-metropolitan and Welsh counties in 1974. Section 218 of the [[Local Government Act 1972]] that established the new system stated: "Her Majesty shall appoint a lord-lieutenant for each county in England and Wales and for Greater London..." The Act appears to be the first statutory use of the term "lord-lieutenant" for lieutenants to counties.

Existing lord lieutenants were assigned to one of the corresponding new counties wherever possible. Where this could not be done, the existing office-holder became a lieutenant of a county, junior to the lord-lieutenant.  For example, the [[Lord Lieutenant of Montgomeryshire]] was appointed [[Lord Lieutenant of Powys]], with those of Breconshire and Radnorshire each being designated as simply "Lieutenant of Powys". This measure was temporary, and no lieutenants have been appointed in this way since 1974, although the power still exists.

In 1975 counties ceased to be used for local government purposes in [[Scotland]]. The [[Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973]] replaced the counties with regions, and each region was to have one or more lord-lieutenants appointed.&lt;ref&gt;The Lord-Lieutenants Order 1975 (1975/428)&lt;/ref&gt; The areas to which they were appointed approximated to the counties and were based and were defined in terms of the new local government districts.

==Present day==

[[File:Lord Crathorne in Lord Lieutenant's Uniform.jpg|thumb|right|The uniform of an English lord-lieutenant includes a rose-and-crown badge on the cap and shoulder-boards]]
In 1996 Scottish regions and districts were abolished on further local government reorganisation, and since that date lord-lieutenants have been appointed to [[Lieutenancy areas of Scotland|"lieutenancy areas"]], roughly equivalent to the old Scottish counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=uksi/1996/731/contents/made|title=The Lord-Lieutenants (Scotland) Order 1996, Statutory Instrument 1996 No. 731 (S.83).|asmade=yes|access_date=3 May 2001|noprefix=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partial reform of local government in England since 1995 has led to the creation of so-called [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial counties]] to which lord-lieutenants are now appointed. The [[Lieutenancies Act 1997]] is the most recent piece of primary legislation dealing with Lieutenancies in England and includes the definitive list of the current areas used. Ceremonial counties may comprise combinations of county council areas and unitary authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=ukpga/1997/23
|title=Lieutenancies Act 1997 (1997 c.23)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the local government re-organisation of 1996 in [[Wales]], lord-lieutenants are now appointed to [[Preserved counties of Wales|"preserved counties"]], i.e. the counties used for administrative purposes from 1974 to 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{UK-LEG|path=wsi/2003/974.htm/contents/made|title=Preserved Counties (Amendment to Boundaries) (Wales) Order 2003|asmade=yes|access_date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[City of London]] was unaffected by changes introduced since 1882. It has a Commission of Lieutenancy rather than a single lord-lieutenant. The head of the commission is the [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]].

===Duties===
Lord-lieutenants are the monarch's representatives in their respective lieutenancies. It is their foremost duty to uphold the dignity of [[the Crown]], and in so doing they seek to promote a spirit of co-operation and good atmosphere through the time they give to voluntary and benevolent organisations and through the interest they take in the business and social life of their counties.

The modern responsibilities of lords-lieutenant include:
* Arranging visits of members of the [[British Royal Family|royal family]] and escorting royal visitors;
* Presenting medals and awards on behalf of the sovereign, and advising on [[British honours system|honours]] nominations;
* Participating in civic, voluntary and social activities within the lieutenancy;
* Acting as liaison with local units of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]], [[British Army|Army]], [[Royal Air Force]] and their associated cadet forces;
* Leading the local [[magistrate|magistracy]] as chairman of the Advisory Committee on [[Justice of the Peace|Justices of the Peace]]; and
* Chairing the local Advisory Committee for the Appointment of the General Commissioners of [[Income Tax]], a tribunal which hears appeals against decisions made by the [[HM Revenue and Customs]] on a variety of different tax related matters.

As the sovereign's representative in his or her county, a lord-lieutenant remains non-political and may not hold office in any political party. They are appointed for life, although the customary age of retirement is 75 and the sovereign may remove them.

===Deputies===
Each lord-lieutenant is supported by a vice lord-lieutenant and [[deputy lieutenant]]s that he or she appoints. The vice lord-lieutenant takes over when the lord-lieutenant is abroad, ill, or otherwise incapacitated. The lord-lieutenant appoints between thirty and forty deputy lieutenants depending on the county's population.

===Remuneration===
They are unpaid, but receive minimal allowances for secretarial help, mileage allowance and a driver. Male lord-lieutenants receive an allowance for the ceremonial uniform, worn when receiving members of the Royal Family and on other formal occasions. There is no uniform for a female lord-lieutenant, but there is a badge which can be worn on ceremonial occasions.

===Uniform===
[[File:Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 9th Earl of Shaftesbury.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Lord Lieutenant, full dress uniform (early 20th century)]]
Since at least the eighteenth century a military-style uniform has been worn by male lieutenants (appropriate to the military origins of the post). Since 1831 this has been analogous to the uniform worn by a general staff officer, but with silver lace in place of the gold worn by regular officers.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, A., ''Ceremonial Costume''. London: A &amp; C Black, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, the design of the uniform changed in line with changes made to army uniform.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/dressinsigniawor00greauoft#page/56/mode/2up Uniform as worn prior to the Second World War, illustrated in ''Dress Worn at Court'', Lord Chamberlain's Office, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; At present, it is a dark blue uniform in the style of a General Officer's [[British Army uniform#No. 1: Temperate ceremonial uniform|Army No. 1 dress]] (but with buttons, shoulder-boards, sash etc. in silver rather than gold). A cap is worn, and a sword with a steel scabbard. The badge on the cap etc. varies depending on where the Lieutenant's County is situated: a rose is worn in England, shamrocks in Northern Ireland, a thistle in Scotland and Prince-of-Wales feathers in Wales. The uniform for a male vice lord-lieutenant and for deputy lieutenants is of a similar style, but with features to distinguish it from that of a lord-lieutenant.

==Lord Lieutenant of Ireland==
The [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] was the head of the British administration in Ireland until the foundation of the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922.

== Forms of address for lord-lieutenants ==

*Written: '(Title and name), Her Majesty's Lord-Lieutenant'
*Salutation: 'Dear Lord-Lieutenant'
*In a speech: 'My Lord-Lieutenant'
*In conversation: '(Title and name)' or 'Lord-Lieutenant'.
*Plural: 'Lord-lieutenants',&lt;ref name="royalweb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/LordLieutenants/LordLieutenants.aspx |title=Lord-Lieutenants |publisher=The Royal Household |accessdate=29 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819061648/http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheRoyalHousehold/OfficialRoyalposts/LordLieutenants/LordLieutenants.aspx |archivedate=19 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the historic form of 'Lords-Lieutenant' frequently appears.

==Colonial equivalents==
In the colonies of the English Empire, and subsequently the British Empire, the duties of lords lieutenant were generally performed by the [[commander-in-chief]] or the [[governor]]. Both offices may have been occupied by the same person.

By way of an example, this is still the case in Britain's second, and oldest remaining, colony, [[Bermuda]], where the [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Navy's headquarters, main base, and dockyard for the North America and West Indies Station]] was established following independence of the United States of America. The colony had raised militia and volunteer forces since official settlement in 1612 (with a troop-of-horse added later), and a small force of regular infantry from 1701 to 1783. A large regular army garrison was built up after 1794, and the reserve forces faded away following the conclusion of the American War of 1812 as the local government lost interest in paying for their upkeep. From this point until the 1960s, governors were almost exclusively senior officers of the Royal Artillery or Royal Engineers who were also military commanders-in-chief (and initially also vice admirals). Attempts to rekindle the militia without a Militia Act or funds from the colonial government were made throughout the century under the authorisation of the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, but none proved lasting. The colonial government was finally compelled to raise militia and volunteer forces (the [[Bermuda Militia Artillery]] and the [[Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps]]) by act in the 1890s (the [[Bermuda Cadet Corps]], [[Bermuda Volunteer Engineers]], and [[Bermuda Militia Infantry]] were added at later dates), and these fell under the Governor and Commander-in-Chief, as well as under operational control of his junior, the brigadier in charge of the Bermuda Command (or [[Bermuda Garrison]]), which included the regular as well as the part-time military (as opposed to naval) forces in the colony. Although the Royal Naval and the regular army establishments have been withdrawn from Bermuda, the [[Governor of Bermuda]] remains the Commander-in-Chief (though most recent office holders have not been career army officers) of the [[Royal Bermuda Regiment]] (a 1965 amalgam of the BMA and BVRC, which had both been reorganised in line with the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] after the [[First World War]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.bm/governor-bermuda|title=The Governor of Bermuda|first=|last=travis.smith-simons|date=3 March 2016|website=www.gov.bm|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180210050132/https://www.gov.bm/governor-bermuda|archivedate=10 February 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebermudian.com/heritage/heritage-heritage/the-good-governor/|title=The Good Governor |work=The Bermudian|last=Shorto|first=Gavin|date=5 April 2018|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approximate equivalents in other countries==
In [[France]] and [[Italy]], the role of Prefect (''[[Prefect (France)|préfet]]'' in French, ''prefetto'' in Italian) is different to that of lord-lieutenant, as the regional and departmental prefects of France are responsible for delivering as well as control functions of public services. In [[Sweden]] ''Landshövding'' and [[Norway]] "Fylkesmann", the regional governor is responsible for administrative control functions of services delivered and decisions made by local and county municipalities, as well as representing the king in the region. In the [[Netherlands]], [[King's Commissioner]] (''Commissaris van de Koning'' in Dutch) is appointed by the monarch, but unlike a lord-lieutenant, belongs to a political party.

==Career==
Morano was born in [[Washington, D.C.]] and raised in [[McLean, Virginia]]. He has a bachelor's degree from [[George Mason University]] in political science.&lt;ref name=almanac&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VxiLhmqot88C&amp;pg=PA606 | title=The Almanac of the Unelected: Staff of the U.S. Congress 2008 | publisher=[[Bernan Press]] | author=Friedman, Lisa | year=2008 | pages=606}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his career working for [[Rush Limbaugh]] from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name=Esquire/&gt; After 1996, he began working for [[Cybercast News Service]], where he was the first to publish the accusations from [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift-Boat veterans]] that [[John Kerry]] had [[John Kerry military service controversy|allegedly exaggerated his military service record]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Beginning in June 2006, Morano served as the director of communications for Senator [[Jim Inhofe]]. He was also communications director for the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]]. In 2007, Morano produced a report listing hundreds of scientists whose work, according to Morano, questions whether [[global warming]] is caused by human activity.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Minority.Blogs&amp;ContentRecord_id=2674e64f-802a-23ad-490b-bd9faf4dcdb7 | title=U.

In April 2009, despite having no formal education in the field of climate science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rolly|first1=Paul|title=Rolly: Climate-change denier to speak at energy summit — and you’re paying for it|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/4267300-155/rolly-climate-change-denier-to-speak-at|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|accessdate=5 March 2017|date=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morano founded and became executive editor of ClimateDepot.com, a website sponsored by the [[Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow]] (CFACT). In November 2009, Morano was one of the first to break the [[Climatic Research Unit email controversy]] story after being contacted by [[Anthony Watts (blogger)|Anthony Watts]]. The story was subsequently picked up by [[James Delingpole]].&lt;ref name= Esquire&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/marc-morano-0410-2|title=This Man Wants to Convince You Global Warming Is a Hoax|work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]|date=March 30, 2010|accessdate=October 2, 2013|author=Richardson, John H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 Morano co-wrote and presented the CFACT-funded documentary ''[[Climate Hustle]]''.

===Media appearances===
In December 2012, Morano debated [[Bill Nye]] on global warming on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/05/clips-from-last-night-bill-nye-vs-marc-morano-on-global-warming-newt-gingrich-on-the-fiscal-cliff/|title=Bill Nye vs Marc Morano on Global Warming|work=[[CNN]]|date=December 4, 2012|accessdate=April 18, 2014|author=Piers Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, Morano debated [[Michael Brune]], executive director of the [[Sierra Club]], again on ''Piers Morgan Tonight''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2013/01/24/pmt-climate-change-marc-morano-michael-brune.cnn.html | title=Does climate change exist? | work=CNN | date=23 January 2013 | accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morano was interviewed in the 2015 documentary ''[[Merchants of Doubt (film)|Merchants of Doubt]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-win-friends-and-bamboozle-people-about-climate-change/ | title=How to Win Friends and Bamboozle People about Climate Change | work=Scientific American | date=6 March 2015 | accessdate=13 August 2015 | author=Biello, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Negative===
Climatologist [[Michael E. Mann]] has criticized Morano.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Don't Even Think About It: Why Our Brains Are Wired to Ignore Climate Change | publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]] |last=Marshall |first=George |authorlink=George Marshall (environmentalist) | year=2014 | page=151 |oclc=885302594 |isbn=9781620401330}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, [[Media Matters for America]], a politically left leaning media watchdog, named Morano the "Climate Change Misinformer of the Year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/12/27/climate-change-misinformer-of-the-year-marc-mor/191878 |title=Climate Change Misinformer Of The Year: Marc Morano |publisher=[[Media Matters for America]] |date=December 27, 2012 |accessdate=September 14, 2013 |last1=Fitzsimmons |first1=Jill |last2=Theel |first2=Shauna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morano has been criticized for publishing the email addresses of climate scientists on ClimateDepot.org. In March 2012, Morano posted an article and the email address of sociology professor [[Kari Norgaard]], who had presented a paper on why it is difficult for societies to take action to respond to climate change. This story was later picked up by [[Rush Limbaugh]], after which Norgaard received threatening emails.&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt; Morano repeated this action again in 2013, when he posted the email address of Shaun Marcott in response to Marcott's having published a temperature reconstruction which resembled the [[hockey stick graph]].&lt;ref name=sciam/&gt;

Morano says that emails targeting climate scientists can be nasty in tone, but he defends the practice of posting their addresses by noting that he himself has received hate mail. He says that his goal is to "let the professors hear from the public" and that receiving nasty emails is "part of the process."&lt;ref name=sciam&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/scientist-targets-of-climate-change-hate-mail-rally-for-support |title=Scientist Targets of Climate Change Hate Mail Rally for Support|work=[[Scientific American]] |date=January 22, 2014 |last=Ogburn |first=Stephanie Paige}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morano's EPW website won a Golden Mouse Award in 2007 for improving communications between Members of Congress and their constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://climatedepot.com/a/40/ClimateDepotcom-Launch-Aims-Tonbsp-Redefine-Global-Warming-Reporting|title=Climate Depot Aims To Redefine Global Warming Reporting|publisher=Climate Depot|date=April 6, 2009|accessdate=September 1, 2013|author=Morano, Marc|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115074332/http://climatedepot.com/a/40/ClimateDepotcom-Launch-Aims-Tonbsp-Redefine-Global-Warming-Reporting|archivedate=January 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, [[Accuracy in Media]] awarded Morano their annual [[Reed Irvine]] Award alongside [[Andrew Breitbart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aim.org/press-release/andrew-breitbart-marc-morano-to-receive-reed-irvine-accuracy-in-media-award/ | title=Andrew Breitbart, Marc Morano to Receive Reed Irvine Accuracy in Media Awards | work=Accuracy in Media | date=16 February 2010 | accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in July 2010, [[Doctors for Disaster Preparedness]] announced it would award Morano that year's [[Petr Beckmann]] Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2010/jul/13/climate-sceptic-morano-award |title=Climate sceptic Morano's 'courage' award is a vicious irony |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=July 13, 2010 |last=Hickman |first=Leo |authorlink=Leo Hickman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "'''market liberalism'''" is used in two distinct ways.

In the United States, the term is used as a synonym to [[classical liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/cato-university/home-study-course/module10 |title=The Achievements of Nineteenth-Century Classical Liberalism |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |quote =Although the term 'liberalism' retains its original meaning in most of the world, it has unfortunately come to have a very different meaning in late twentieth-century America. Hence terms such as ''market liberalism'', ''classical liberalism'', or ''libertarianism'' are often used in its place in America.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, market liberalism depicts a [[political ideology]], combining [[free market economy]] with [[personal liberty]] and [[human rights]], in contrast to [[social liberalism]], which combines [[personal liberty]] and [[human rights]] along with a [[mixed economy]] and [[welfare state]]. The former kind is also known in the US popularly as "[[libertarianism]]".

In Europe and elsewhere, the term market liberalism is often used as a synonym to [[economic liberalism]],&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Ken Inglis]] (2006): ''Whose ABC? The Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 1983–2006''. Black Inc., Melbourne, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; depicting a policy supporting the economic aspects of [[liberalism]], without necessarily including the political aspects of liberalism.  In some political spheres, market liberalism refers to a economically liberal society that also provides a minimal to moderate-sized welfare state for its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-liberal-market-economy.htm#]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matzpen''' ({{lang-he-n|מצפן}}, lit. 'Compass') is the name of a revolutionary socialist and [[anti-Zionist]] organisation, founded in [[Israel]] in 1962 which was active until the 1980s. Its official name was the '''Socialist Organisation in Israel''', but it became better known as Matzpen after its monthly publication.

==Origins==
The organisation was founded by former members of the Israeli Communist Party – [[Maki (historical political party)|Maki]] – who opposed that party's unquestioned support for the international policies of the [[Soviet Union]]. They offered a more radical analysis of and opposition to [[Zionism]]. An early analysis of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]], written before they left the Communist Party, by [[Moshe Machover]] and [[Akiva Orr]] (using a pseudonym, N. Israeli), appeared in Hebrew in 1961 under the title of ''Shalom, Shalom ve'ein Shalom'' (שלום, שלום, ואין שלום; Peace, Peace When There is No Peace – an English translation was completed in 2009; although still unpublished as of August 2016, the translation is available online).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Akiva Orr|author2=Moshé Machover|authorlink1=Aki Orr|authorlink2=Moshé Machover|title=Peace, Peace When There is No Peace|url=http://www.akiorrbooks.com/files/PEACE.pdf|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matzpen drew together Jewish and Arab activists with various backgrounds in left-wing organisations and affiliations. Prominent among them was [[Jabra Nicola]], a [[Arab citizens of Israel|Palestinian-Israeli]] intellectual and activist who helped shape the theoretical orientation of the nascent organisation.&lt;ref name=Asmarp18&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?cd=2&amp;id=YSG7AAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=jabra+nicola+matzpen&amp;q=jabra+nicola+#search_anchor|title=Towards a Socialist Republic of Palestine|first1=Fouzi|last1=Asmar|first2=Uri|last2=Davis |first3=Naïm|last3=Khader|publisher=Ithaca Press|year=1978|ISBN=978-0-903729-31-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenstein|first=Ran|title=A Palestinian Revolutionary: Jabra Nicola and the Radical Left|journal=Jerusalem Quarterly|year=2011|issue=Summer 2011 – Issue 46|url=http://www.jerusalemquarterly.org/images/ArticlesPdf/46-A%20Palestinian%20Revolutionary.pdf|publisher=Institute Of Jerusalem Studies|pages=32–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It published a magazine of the same name in Hebrew and Arabic. The organisation grew in the period after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israel's occupation]] of Palestinian and Arab territories.&lt;ref&gt;Ran Greenstein, "Class, Nation, and Political Organization: The Anti-Zionist Left in Israel/Palestine", ''International Labor and Working Class History'', 75 (Spring 2009): 85–108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Core positions==
In a statement titled "Down with the Occupation”, from 1 January 1969, Matzpen distinguished itself – together with [[Maki (political party)|the Communist Party (Rakah)]] – as the only forces conducting "a consistent struggle against the continued occupation of the territories conquered in June '67".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matzpen.org/index.asp?u=120&amp;p=doc4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723100725/http://www.matzpen.org/index.asp?u=120&amp;p=doc4 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with a situation in which "Israel controls the whole of the Palestine Mandate territory as well as vast tracts of Egyptian territory and a region in the south of Syria", Matzpen asserted in "General Declaration by the ISO" in March 1968, that "It is both the right and duty of every conquered and subjugated people to resist and to struggle for its freedom. The ways, means and methods necessary and appropriate for such struggle must be determined by the people itself and it would be hypocritical for strangers - especially if they belong to the oppressing nation – to preach to it, saying, 'Thus shalt thou do, and thus shalt thou not do.'" It added, that despite its recognition of "the unconditional right of the conquered to resist occupation", as an organization it could support politically "only such organizations which, in addition to resisting occupation, also recognize the right of the Israeli people for self-determination" in order to enable "a joint struggle of Arabs and Jews in the region for a common future."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matzpen.org/index.asp?u=120&amp;p=doc3 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723100734/http://www.matzpen.org/index.asp?u=120&amp;p=doc3 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, Matzpen's aim was to create a broad front of people opposed to the occupation and in favour of a de-Zionized Israel, which would form part of a socialist federation of the entire Middle East. In contrast to the Communist Party and the Zionist Left, Matzpen insisted that the 1967 occupation was but one stage in the long history of Zionist settlement, and reversing it would be a necessary but not sufficient condition for overall solution to the problems of the Middle East. For such a solution, political mobilization of Arabs, Jews, and other national minorities in the region would be needed. The political framework for this mobilization became known as the Arab Revolution, which combined national and socialist tasks in the process of struggle against Zionism, imperialism and Arab reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Jabra Nicola and Moshe Machover, "The Palestinian Struggle and Revolution in the Middle East", ''Matzpen'' 50, August 1969, {{cite web |url=http://matzpen.org/index.asp?p=revolution50 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020406/http://matzpen.org/index.asp?p=revolution50 |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; To advance these aims, Matzpen established links with [[New Left]] organisations in Europe and other parts of the world, and also with progressive Palestinian organisations, such as the [[Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Gresh&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z6mAa4WubagC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;dq=matzpen+dflp&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=matzpen%20dflp&amp;f=false|page=112|title=The new A-Z of the Middle East |first1=Alain|last1=Gresh|first2=Dominique|last2=Vidal|edition=2nd, illustrated|publisher=I.B.Tauris|year=2004|ISBN=9781860643262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cobbanp154&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wwntdx2IFAEC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;dq=matzpen+dflp&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=matzpen%20dflp&amp;f=false|title=The Palestinian Liberation Organisation: people, power, and politics|first1=Helena|last1=Cobban|edition=Reprint, illustrated|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1984|ISBN=9780521272162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the original analyses and statements of the organisation were included in a published collection under the title ''The Other Israel: The Radical Case Against Zionism'', edited by Arie Bober (Doubleday, 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/history/etol/document/mideast/toi/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915230126/http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/marxists/history/etol/document/mideast/toi/index.html |archivedate=2007-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bober's book provided an overview of the positions held by Matzpen at the time on a range of issues, and thus is an essential resource on the organisation's analysis of Israeli society and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In the introduction to the book he says: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"This book is the result of five years' collective effort by a small group of Arab and Jewish citizens of Israel to penetrate the dense net of illusion and myth that today dominates the thinking and feeling of most Israelis and, at the same time, largely determines the prevailing image of Israel in the Western world. According to the Zionist fairy tale, the state of Israel is an outpost of democracy, social justice and enlightenment, and a homeland and haven for the persecuted Jews of the world. This outpost, so the story goes, though earnestly seeking peace with its neighbors finds itself in a state of perpetual siege because of the greed of Arab rulers, the inherent “unreasonableness” of the Oriental mind and the innate Gentile proclivity toward hatred of the Jews.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The reality, this book demonstrates, is utterly different. The Zionist state was born in the violent expropriation and expulsion from their country of the Palestinian Arabs, and that process continues today. In open alliance with Western, especially United States, imperialism, and in scarcely hidden collusion with the most reactionary forces in the Arab world, the Zionist state actively sets itself against every step, no matter how faltering, taken by the Arab masses to alleviate the centuries’ old misery imposed on them by colonialism and imperialism. Within the territories occupied since 1967, the Zionist state employs a system of direct military repression to expel Palestinian Arabs from their lands and secure Jewish colonization of them, and to crush every expression of Palestinian resistance. Within its own borders, the Zionist state engages in systematic national oppression of its minority of Arab citizens. The dark-skinned majority of the privileged Jewish community itself increasingly feels the sting of racist discrimination, as economic inequality increases and social conditions deteriorate. Far from offering a haven to the persecuted Jews of the world, the Zionist state is leading new immigrants and old settlers alike toward a new holocaust by mobilizing them in a colonial enterprise and a counterrevolutionary army against the struggle of the Arab masses for national liberation and social emancipation – a struggle that is not only just but will eventually be victorious. This state of affairs is, moreover, in no sense accidental. It was the inevitable outcome of the success of the Zionist project to establish a Jewish state in Palestine. And to change this reality requires not merely a change of government or a modification of one or another specific policy, but a revolutionary transformation of the very foundations of Israeli society."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Matzpen outside Israel==
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, supporters of Matzpen abroad published ''Israca'' (Israeli Revolutionary Action Committee Abroad).{{cn|date=October 2017}} The magazine included many articles published in ''Matzpen''. Some of ''Matzpen'' was censored and that material was republished in ''Israca''.{{cn|date=October 2017}} [[Moshé Machover]], [[Eli Lobel]], [[Haim Hanegbi]], and Akiva Orr were all part of the editorial board.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In the late 1970s and early 1980s, supporters of the organisation and other radical left academics and activists formed another journal in the UK, ''[[Khamin (journal)|Khamsin]]'', in which they published their analyses of current events.{{cn|date=October 2017}} A selection of material from ''Khamsin'' was published under the title ''Forbidden Agenda: Intolerance and Defiance in the Middle East'' ([[Saqi Books]], 2000).

==Splits and debates==
In 1970 the organisation started going through a process of ideological and organisational fragmentation, with some members leaving to form new groups, such as Avangard with a [[Trotskyist]] orientation, led by [[Menahem Carmi]] and [[Sylvain Cypel]], and [[Ma'avak]] (Revolutionary Communist Alliance), with a [[Maoist]] orientation, led by [[Ilan Halevi|Ilan Albert]] and [[Rami Livneh]]. A further split within the latter organisation saw the formation of the [[Revolutionary Communist Alliance - Red Front]], led by [[Udi Adiv]] and [[Dan Vered]]. Avangard also underwent splits, which saw the formation of the [[Spartacist League of Israel|Spartacist League]] in 1974 and the [[Nitzotz]] group in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Details in Ran Greenstein, "Socialist Anti-Zionism: A chapter in the history of the Israeli radical left", ''Socialist History'', 35 (2009): 20-39&lt;/ref&gt;

The theoretical debates that led to the splits in Matzpen had to do with the conceptualization of the relations between [[class struggle]] and nationalism in the struggle for socialism. Avangard regarded Israel as a normal capitalist society in which the working class was the primary revolutionary agent. Hence, it saw its goal as the mobilization of that class to create an Israeli socialist republic. It regarded Matzpen's focus on the Israeli-Palestinian national conflict and on the colonial origins of Israeli society as a distraction from the class struggle. Ma'avak, in contrast, saw Matzpen as not emphasizing enough the colonial character of Israeli society. It saw its goal as that of facilitating the Palestinian national liberation struggle as a necessary step towards socialism. In response to both groups, Matzpen re-asserted its combination of support for national and social struggles.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

A major split within the core group of mainstream Matzpen took place in 1972, and both factions kept the name Matzpen for their respective journals, an issue that gave rise to sharp dispute between them.&lt;ref&gt;http://israeli-left-archive.org/greenstone/collect/znews/index/assoc/HASH6833.dir/doc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The obvious value of the 'Matzpen' label as a marker of radical left-wing politics was behind that decision.{{cn|date=October 2017}} Most of the original leadership remained in what became known as Matzpen Tel Aviv, while the other faction became known as Matzpen Jerusalem. That latter group adopted the name Matzpen Marxist, to distinguish itself from its rivals. In 1975 it changed its name to Revolutionary Communist League, section of the [[Reunified Fourth International|Fourth International]], while retaining the title Matzpen Marxist for its regular publication. The Tel Aviv group also changed its name subsequently (in 1978) to the Socialist Organization in Israel and dropped the adjective 'Israeli' in order to avoid possible association with Zionism. Both groups retained the original Matzpen dual focus on class and national liberation. Machover, Orr and Haim Hanegbi remained with the Tel Aviv based group, while the Jerusalem-based group was led by Arieh Bober and [[Michel Warschawski]] (Mikado). A youth movement known as Hafarperet (mole) was affiliated with the latter group, and was active in the mid-1970s, mostly in Haifa.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

==The Red Front trial==
One of the organizations to emerge from Matzpen, the Red Front, had a brief history of just over a year. At the end of 1972 many of its members were arrested and charged with espionage and collaboration with the enemy (Syrian military intelligence), based on a secret trip some of them took to Damascus. None of the activists detained and charged were members of Matzpen at the time, or at the time they committed their alleged offences against state security. In a well-publicised trial in 1973 five members of the Red Front were sentenced to various periods in prison. Many of the defendants stated that they had been subjected to torture and other forms of physical and mental harassment by the Israeli security services before the trial, to force confessions out of them.&lt;ref&gt;Statements about the torture, including names of affected people, and a petition by family members and human rights activists are found in both issues of ''Matzpen'' 67 published separately by the two factions in January 1973, http://israeli-left-archive.org/greenstone/collect/znews/index/assoc/HASH01e4/5fd5f17b.dir/doc.pdf and {{cite web |url=http://www.matzpen.org/index.asp?g=67 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723100741/http://www.matzpen.org/index.asp?g=67 |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is obvious that none of them had any interest in working with the Syrian or other Arab regimes, and their sole interest consisted in establishing links with other revolutionary organizations in the region, primarily Palestinian ones. Statements before the trial, submitted by the leading defendants – Daud Turki and Ehud Adiv – allow us to get a clear idea of their perspective.

Turki, A Palestinian-Arab citizen of Israel, defined their goal as socialism: “the common goal of all workers, peasants and those who are persecuted in Israeli society. The Jews have a share, and they must have a share, because they are members of the organization on a footing of equality with me, in establishing a new government and a new regime which will allow both the Jewish people and the Arab people to play an effective part in the struggle of the Arab people for liberation”. Turki went on to criticise Zionism, which “instead of adopting, as it should, a neutral attitude, or one of support for the Arab struggle for national and socialist liberation, it has stood beside this movement's enemies, beside the Americans who are persecuting the Vietnamese people, beside American imperialism which is exploiting the peoples of Latin America and the peoples of Asia and Africa, and setting the Jewish people against the Arab people forever. I think that this attitude amounts to a crime against both the Jewish people and the Arab people.” In his view, Jews should support the Arab struggle for liberation rather than a struggle that supersedes nationalism, although both groups have “the same future and would live together in a single homeland under the rule of a single state, a state liberated from all foreign influence and all social exploitation.”

The same approach was displayed by Adiv. Accepting that “all trends of Matzpen” had “a sound theory”, he argued that they lacked “the chapter entitled ‘what is to be done’ to reach the multi-national socialist Middle East they talk of, and in their political activity they restrict their talk to the Jewish state of Israel. That is to say they are preoccupied with convincing the Jews, and completely disregard the Arab struggle, and in particular the Palestinian Arab struggle against Zionism and the state of Israel.” A change of focus was needed to convert the national conflict into a class struggle. This could be done only “if the Jews will prove to the Arabs, who have been fighting Zionism for dozens of years, that they [the Jews] are on their side, that they are prepared to sacrifice everything they have, to be subjected to the same ‘treatment’ and to share everything with them. Without this no Arab will have confidence that the sincerest Jewish revolutionary is really revolutionary. No ideology, not even the most equitable and progressive, can convince the Arabs unless it is accompanied by action on the part of those who adhere to it.”&lt;ref&gt;"The Red Front Trial: The Depositions of Turki and Adiv", ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', 2, 4 (Summer 1973): 144-150, https://www.jstor.org/pss/2535650&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond organizational existence – Matzpen's legacy==
With the rise of new, vibrant and less ideologically rigid protest movements in the 1980s, in opposition to the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict|continued occupation]] and to the [[1982 Lebanon War|war in Lebanon]] (Committee for Solidarity with [[Birzeit University]], committees against torture and [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions|house demolitions]], [[Refusal to serve in the Israeli military|Yesh Gvul]], [[Alternative Information Center]], Workers Advice Center, and so on), the different factions of Matzpen lost much of their raison d'etre. The space for overall left-wing organizations, with comprehensive political agendas, shrank with the growing focus on the occupation and its consequences. Many activists sought new organizational forms in order to enhance their ability to make an effective contribution to the political struggle, without carrying cumbersome ideological and organizational baggage. Much of the energy of the Revolutionary Communist League, for example, went into creating and maintaining the Alternative Information Center, which effectively depleted the League of its own organizational capacity. As a result, most of the Matzpen factions ceased to have a distinct organizational existence by the late 1980s, if not before that. Many of their former members though, continue to participate as dedicated individuals in various activities against the occupation and for workers and human rights.

A documentary about the group, entitled "Matzpen", was made by Eran Torbiner in 2003. Another documentary about Avangard was produced in 2009 by Tom Carmi (son of two former leaders of the group) and presented at the Tel Aviv [[Docaviv|Docaviv festival]]. It is titled "Away from the Tribe's Centre", and was awarded second prize in the students' films competition. In these documentaries as well as most other books by and interviews with members who ended-up in different factions, the doctrinal differences that led to their divergent paths disappear from view. The focus almost invariably is on activities against the occupation, anti-Zionist positions, the sense of dissent, and so on, which they all shared, rather than on what had set them apart.

Despite the absence of organizational activity, some of the original Matzpen members continue to write and be active politically. Haim Hanegbi and Michel Warschawski played a key role in writing the 2004 Olga Document, which is a statement of the anti-Zionist position and a radical critique of Israeli policies and practices, and Warschawski published his political memoir in English, ''On the Border'' (South End Press, 2004; original French in 2002). He further published, together with Lebanese academic and activist Gilbert Achcar, a book titled ''The 33-Day War: Israel's War on Hezbollah in Lebanon and Its Consequences'' (Paradigm Publishers, 2007), in which the war is covered with a focus on both Israeli and Lebanese perspectives. Sylvain Cypel wrote a historical and political analysis of Israeli society under the title ''Walled: Israeli Society at an Impasse'' (Other Press, 2007; original French in 2006). Moshe Machover has continued to publish theoretical papers analyzing Israel/Palestine within the broader Middle Eastern framework, and in 2009, together with Ehud Ein-Gil, he published an article in the UK journal ''Race &amp; Class'', titled "Zionism and Oriental Jews: a dialectic of exploitation and co-optation", in which they analyze the question of ethnic divisions within Israel society.

A new book on Matzpen was published in Israel in September 2010, under the title ''Matzpen: Conscience and Fantasy'' (Tel Aviv: Resling, 2010). It is the most comprehensive account to date of the organization's history, based on interviews with former activists and a study of documents.

{{Politics of Greece}}
'''Metaxism''' ({{lang-el|Μεταξισμός}}) is a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] [[Nationalism|nationalist]] ideology associated with [[Greece|Greek]] dictator [[Ioannis Metaxas]].&lt;ref name="stanpayne"&gt;{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley G |year=1995 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLiFIEdI1V4C&amp;dq=A+History+of+Fascism+payne&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |title=A History of Fascism, 1914–45 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press| isbn=0-299-14874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It called for the regeneration of the [[Greeks|Greek nation]] and the establishment of a modern, culturally homogenous Greece.&lt;ref name=Sorensen&gt;Gert Sørensen, Robert Mallett. International fascism, 1919-45. London, England, UK; Portland, Oregon, USA: Frank Cass Publishers, 2002. Pp. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaxism disparaged [[liberalism]], and held individual interests to be subordinate to those of the nation, seeking to mobilize the Greek people as a disciplined mass in service to the creation of a "new Greece."&lt;ref name=Sorensen /&gt;

Metaxas declared that his [[4th of August Regime]] (1936–1941) represented a "[[Third Greek Civilization]]" which was committed to the creation of a culturally purified Greek nation based upon the [[Militarism|militarist]] societies of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]] and [[Sparta]], which he held to constitute the "First Greek Civilization"; and the Orthodox Christian ethic of the [[Byzantine Empire]], which he considered to represent the "Second Greek Civilization."&lt;ref name=Sorensen/&gt; The Metaxas regime asserted that true Greeks were ethnically Greek and Christian, intending to deliberately exclude [[Albanians]], [[Slavs]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] residing in Greece from Greek citizenship.&lt;ref name=Sorensen/&gt;

Although the Metaxas government and its official doctrines are often described as [[Fascism|Fascist]], academically it is considered to have been a conventional totalitarian-conservative dictatorship akin to [[Francisco Franco]]'s [[Francoist Spain|Spain]] or [[António de Oliveira Salazar]]'s [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]].&lt;ref name="stanpayne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="European Dictatorships, 1918–1945"&gt;Lee, Stephen J. 2000. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=KnvJO9yfvEAC= European Dictatorships, 1918-1945]'' Routledge; 2 edition (22 Jun 2000). {{ISBN|0415230462}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Metaxist government derived its authority from the conservative establishment and its doctrines strongly supported traditional institutions such as the [[Church of Greece|Greek Orthodox Church]] and the [[Greek Royal Family|Greek Monarchy]]; essentially [[reactionary]], it lacked the radical theoretical dimensions of ideologies such as [[Italian Fascism]] and [[nazism|German Nazism]].&lt;ref name="stanpayne" /&gt;&lt;ref name="European Dictatorships, 1918–1945"/&gt;

The ideology of Metaxism was associated with Metaxas' political party, the [[Freethinkers' Party (Greece)|Freethinkers' Party]] and the [[4th of August Regime]].&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;Peter Davies, Derek Lynch. The Routledge companion to fascism and the far right. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2002. Pp. 276.&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war period it has been advocated by the [[4th of August Party]] and the [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] party.

== Main ideas ==
*'''[[Greek nationalism]]''': Promoted cultural purity of the Greek nation and endorsed the creation of a "Third Hellenic Civilization".
*'''[[Monarchism]]''': Considered the institution of monarchy a pillar of national unity.
*'''[[Anticommunism]]''': Metaxism was very hostile to [[left-wing]] and [[Communism|communist]] ideologies.
*'''[[Member of Parliament|Anti-Parliamentarianism]]''': Denounced the old parliamentary system as a cause of anarchy, division and economic decline.
*'''[[Corporatism]]''': Worked strongly through corporations
*'''[[Protectionism]]''': Considered the [[market liberalism|market-liberal]] policies of the old state to have failed.
*'''[[Anti-imperialism]]''': Opposed the domination and influence of Greece by foreign powers.

The ideology developed by Metaxas began with Metaxas' response to the [[11 September 1922 Revolution|revolution of 1922]] that put in a pro-republican government in Greece. Metaxas formed the Freethinkers' Party, a monarchist party that originally supported the advancement of civil liberties, though this changed with Metaxas' evolving political views.&lt;ref name=Fischer170&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaxas supported the failed counterrevolution by monarchists against the republican-oriented government on October 23, 1923 that collapsed within a week, an arrest warrant was issued for Metaxas who fled Greece to exile in Norway.&lt;ref name=Fischer170 /&gt; The pro-republican government achieved its aim in 1924 when the Greek monarchy was deposed and a Greek republic was established.&lt;ref name=Fischer170 /&gt; In 1924, Metaxas officially changed his position from opposition to the republic to acceptance of its institutions.&lt;ref name=Fischer170 /&gt;

In the 1926 general election, Metaxas' Freethinkers' Party won 54 out of 250 seats in the Greek parliament, resulting in the party becoming part of Greece's coalition government and Metaxas becoming Minister of Communications.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt; However the Freethinkers' Party collapsed in public support in the 1928 election, losing almost all of its seats, including Metaxas' own seat.&lt;ref name=Fischer172&gt;Jürgen Fischer.

By the 1930s, Metaxas openly condemned the [[parliamentary system]] in Greece.&lt;ref name=Fischer172 /&gt; In 1935, Metaxas' party joined other monarchist parties in an electoral coalition known as the [[United Royalists]] that called for the restoration of the monarchy, however the Freethinkers' Party won only seven seats in the election.&lt;ref name=Fischer174&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 174.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a monarchist government was formed in Greece in 1935 resulting in the restoration of King [[George II of Greece]] as head of state.&lt;ref name=Fischer174 /&gt;

King George II had held close relations with Metaxas in the past and appointed Metaxas as Prime Minister of Greece in May 1936.&lt;ref name=Fischer174 /&gt; Upon becoming Prime Minister, Metaxas made clear his discontent with the political deadlock between feuding political blocs in Greece's parliament and the rising labour unrest being exploited by the [[Communist Party of Greece]].&lt;ref name=Fischer174 /&gt; Metaxas quickly sought to crush dissent including labour unrest in the form of decrees that did not require acceptance by the Greek parliament.&lt;ref name=Fischer174 /&gt;

On August 4, 1936, Metaxas gained the King's support for a decree that dissolved parliament.  He declared martial law, suspended civil rights such as liberty of the subject, and mobilized transport and public workers to support him.&lt;ref name=Fischer180&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Metaxas justified these actions as necessary to prevent communist revolution.&lt;ref name=Fischer180 /&gt; Numerous arrests were made of leftist leaders and others following these proclamations.&lt;ref name=Fischer180 /&gt; Metaxas abolished all political parties including his own, ruling as an official independent.&lt;ref name=Fischer181&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; This date is considered the beginning of Metaxas' totalitarian rule known as the [[4th of August Regime]].

Metaxas was referred to by supporters as the ''[[Archigos]]'' (Leader) and promised to create a "New State" in Greece that called for Greeks to wholly commit themselves to the nation with self-control as the Spartans had done.&lt;ref name=Fischer184&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the 4th of August Regime justified Metaxas' dictatorship on the basis that the "First Greek Civilization" involved the Athenian dictatorship of [[Pericles]] who had brought ancient Greece to greatness.&lt;ref name=Fischer184 /&gt;

Metaxas introduced widespread strict censorship of the press and banned literature of authors considered taboo by the regime, including literature by [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], and [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name=Fischer181 /&gt;

Metaxas sought the creation of a disciplined younger generation as being critical for the future of Greece and for the strengthening of his regime and its principles that world entrench the Third Greek Civilization.&lt;ref name=Fischer185&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1936 the regime created the National Youth Organization of Greece (EON) that gained 200,000 members by 1938 and by 1939 when youth membership in the EON became mandatory, it absorbed the Boy Scouts of Greece.&lt;ref name=Fischer185 /&gt; Members of the EON took an oath of fidelity to the principles of the 4th of August that included: embracing the institutions of the monarchy; support of national pride and faith of the Greek civilization; opposition to parliamentarianism and communism; support of the development of egalitarian, non-individualistic, virtuous citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Jürgen Fischer. Balkan strongmen: dictators and authoritarian rulers of South Eastern Europe. London, England, UK: Purdue University Press, 2007. Pp. 185-186.&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the Metaxas regime's ties to [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="Davies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;*Payne, Stanley G. 1995. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=NLiFIEdI1V4C&amp;dq=A+History+of+Fascism+payne&amp;lr=&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 A History of Fascism, 1914–45]''. University of Wisconsin Press. {{ISBN|0-299-14874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was drawn into [[World War II]] opposite the [[Axis Powers]] after the [[Greco-Italian War|Italian invasion of Greece]], Metaxas then aligned his government with the [[allies of world war ii|allies]] until Greece capitulated and yielded to occupation by the Axis powers following the [[Battle of Greece]]. Metaxas died on 29 January 1941, leaving an unfinished plan (never published), concerning a "new constitution" for Greece aiming to a new form of government without the disadvantages of the old parliamentary system.

In religious affairs, the regime followed the tradition of the state controlling and using the religious and ecclesiastic institutions. The regime was tolerant towards the religious minorities (mainly Jews and Muslims). It was not antisemitic and prohibited antisemitic publications by certain newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://journals.openedition.org/ceb/5120#tocto3n8 Isabelle Dépret, "Ioannis Metaxas and Religion (1938-41): Historical Experience and Current Debates in Greece", ''Cahiers balkaniques'', 42, 2014] In french&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
The [[social control]] which was established by Metaxas and the ideas passed to the youth, especially through the [[National Youth Organisation (Greece)|National Youth Organisation]], had a significant influence on the Greek society and the post-war political system. Some examples are the [[censorship]], which was in use until the [[Metapolitefsi]], and the surviving elements of a [[police state]]. In the immediate post-war era Metaxism was advocated by the [[4th of August Party]]. The ideas of the [[4th of August Regime]] was also an extra motive for the group of right-wing army officers who seized power in a [[coup d'état]] and led to the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974]]. Today the only party of the Greek parliament which claims to follow the ideas of Metaxas is the right-wing extremist [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://xaameriki.wordpress.com/faq/|publisher=[[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]]|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[South Korea]]n government enacted the Minimum Wage Act on December 31, 1986. The Minimum Wage System began on January 1, 1988. At this time the economy was booming{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}, and the minimum wage set by the government was less than 30 percent of that of real workers. The Minister of Employment and Labor in Korea requests the Minimum Wage Commission to review the minimum wage by March 31 every year. The Minimum Wage Commission must submit the minimum wage bill within 90 days after the request has been received by the 27 committee members. If there is no objection, the new minimum wage will then take effect from January 1. The minimum wage committee decided to raise the minimum wage in 2018 by 16.4% from the previous year to 7,530 won(US$7.03) per hour. This is the largest increase since 2001 when it was increased by 16.8%.

== Korean law about minimum wage ==
Article 32 (1) of the [[Constitution of South Korea|Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]: Every citizen has the right to work. The country should make efforts to enhance the employment of its workers and  ensure proper wages in social and economic ways, and implement the minimum wage system as provided under the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/LSW//lsLinkProc.do?lsClsCd=L&amp;lsNm=%EB%8C%80%ED%95%9C%EB%AF%BC%EA%B5%AD%ED%97%8C%EB%B2%95&amp;lsId=prec20060622&amp;joNo=003200&amp;efYd=20060622&amp;mode=11&amp;lnkJoNo=undefined|title=Article 32 of the Constitution of the Republic of Korea|last=|first=|date=|website=National Legal Information Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea has guaranteed its workers the minimum wage through 'the Minimum Wage Act'.

Article 1 of the Minimum Wage Act(Objective): This act aims to ensure the minimum level of wages for workers so as to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by promiting the stabilization of their livelihood and the qualitative improvement of their workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.go.kr/lsInfoP.do?urlMode=lsInfoP&amp;lsId=000129#0000|title=the Minimum Wage Act|last=|first=|date=|website=National Legal Information Center|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Minimum wage deliberation and decision''' ===
The minimum wage in the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] is determined by the [http://minimumwage.go.kr/eng/main.html Minimum Wage Commission] under the [[Ministry of Employment and Labor]]. The Minimum Wage Commission consists of 27 employees, 9 of which are employee commissioners, user committee members and public interest committee members. The Minimum Wage Commission reviews and decides the minimum wage level each year, deliberates and reviews the minimum wage, deliberates on the classification of the minimum wage application, and studies and suggests for the development of the minimum wage system. Other important matters concerning the minimum wage are the functions of the Minister of Employment and Labor to review matters to be held at the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minimumwage.go.kr/about/aboutMinimumwage.jsp|title=최저임금위원회|website=minimumwage.go.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The purpose of the Minimum Wage Commission is to contribute to the sound development of the national economy by ensuring the lowest level of wages for workers and thereby improving the quality of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minimumwage.go.kr/about/aboutMinimumwage.jsp|title=최저임금위원회|website=minimumwage.go.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Minister of Employment and Labor in Korea requests the Minimum Wage Commission to review the minimum wage by March 31 of each year. The Minimum Wage Commission shall submit the minimum wage bill within 90 days (June 29) of the day after the request has been received by the 27 committee members. When the minister of employment and labor receives the minimum wage bill, it shall notify it. At this time, the person representing the employee and the person representing the employer may file a complaint with the Minister of Employment and Labor within 10 days from the date of notification. If there is no objection, the minimum wage will be notified and the minimum wage will be determined by August 5 every year. The new minimum wage will take effect from January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://minimumwage.go.kr/info/infoProc01.jsp|title=최저임금위원회|website=minimumwage.go.kr|language=ko|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A penalty for violating minimum wage laws ==

=== Legal punishment ===
User should not lower their existing wage levels because of the minimum wage under the Labor Standards Act. The Minimum Wage Law provides the following for penalties for minimum wage violations.

Article 28 (penalty) 

① A person who pays less than the minimum wage in violation of Article 6, paragraph 1 or 2, or who has lowered the previous wage for a minimum wage is sentenced to less than three years in prison or 20 million won. In this case, prison terms and fines may be serious (Article 28 of the Minimum Wage Act), as a result, for those who pay the minimum wage, as well as for those who are paid less than that.

Article 30 (billionable regualtion) 

①If a representative of a corporation, an agent, a user, or any other employee commits a breach of Article 28 in respect of its business, he or she shall punish the person. 

②The contractor shall carry out the joint responsibility in accordance with Article 6 paragraph 7. Even though the superintendent ordered him to carry out the joint responsibility, the contractor shall carry it out within the time limit of 6.

=== Minimum wage violation counseling and reporting ===
A case of minimum wage violations can be consulted at the Civil Affairs Center of the Ministry of Employment and Labor(1350). However, only counseling, and not reporting, is possible in 1350. If an employees wants to receive a report, they can report it on 'Civil Service 24' website that integrates and provides government services, complaints, policies and information. If the employee wishes to receive a petition for the relief of their rights due to the understudy of minimum wage, they may visit the local employment office of the plant or file a petition via the Internet.

=== Punishment status ===
In 2016, the Ministry of Employment and Labor presided over a total of 1,278 minimum wage violation cases. However, only 17 cases led to actual judicial proceeding, meaning less than 2 percent of cases received legal proceeding. About 98 percent of the cases were demarcated for 'corrective action'. Employers who violated the minimum wage law have been able to avoid charges or legal proceedings by taking corrective action. As a result of the lack of legal enforcement, according to the Bank of Korea's analysis report on the latest minimum wage trend and evaluation in 2016, the number of workers receiving less than the minimum wage continues to soar.

== Debate over consequences ==
Since the Minimum Wage Act was enacted in 1986, the minimum wage has been steadily rising. However, there are endless discussions over minimum wage laws and minimum wage increases. 

The following table summarizes the pros and cons of minimum wage.
{| class="wikitable"
|+
!Arguments in favor of minimum wage laws
!Arguments against minimum wage laws
|-
|Supporters of a minimum wage claim it has these effects:

*A minimum wage increase can lead to shorter business hours and shorter working hours, which can improve people's quality of life.
* The minimum wage increase is close to the average monthly living cost of two to three households, calculated by the National Statistical Office.
* According to the International Monetary Fund(IMF), the minimum wage is effective in raising productivity of workers, and the impact of the minimum wage increase on employment is somewhat exaggerated.
* The minimum wage increase not only has a positive impact on stable living for the working families but also on boosting the national economy.
*An upward wage adjustment improves worker's earning power and protects them from exploitation by employers.
* 
|Opponents of a minimum wage claim it has these effects:

* With minimum wage, small merchants  who are not able to pay high labor costs are burdened to hire employees.
*Minimum wages cause fewer employees to hire and work less time.
* The minimum wage is not a fundamental solution for low-paid workers to solve an excessive number of phenomena.
* A minimum wage increase allows employees to employ highly productive workers. As a result, older people who are relatively less productive in labor are at greater risk of losing their jobs.
*

== Opinions of journalists and scholars ==
Last year, the minimum wage committee decided to raise the minimum wage in 2018 by 16.4% from the previous year to 7,530 won. This is the largest increase (1060 won) in the past and the maximum increase in 16 years since 2001 (16.8 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?no=205193&amp;year=2018|title=다시 불붙는 최저임금 논쟁 속도조절vs1만원 공약 달성|last=Il-seon|first=Son|date=2018-03-30|work=Maeil Business News Korea|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko|trans-title=Reignite minimum wage debate: Speed adjustment and a 10,000 won commitment}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effectiveness and feasibility of minimum wage increases are greatly debated topics. Both conservative newspapers and liberal pundits across South Korea were quick to denounce the new minimum wage measures. The [[The Chosun Ilbo|Chosun Ilbo]] reported on the day after the 2018 minimum wage increase was announced that [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]] and small business owners were opposed to raising the minimum wage. They said, "The minimum wage increase is a measure that does not take into account the imminent reality of small and medium sized companies suffering from sluggish sales."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://biz.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/17/2017071700149.html|title=편의점·치킨업주 "차라리 내가 다른 가게 알바 뛰는 게 낫지"|last=Sung-jin|first=Chae|date=2017-07-17|work=조선일보|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko|trans-title=Convenience store / chicken owner "I'd rather work part time at another store"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[The Dong-a Ilbo|Dong-A Ilbo]] also criticized the government's minimum wage increase on the same day, reporting on the criticism of the 'Small Business Federation' and 'Korea Employers Federation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20170717/85383747/1|title=“알바월급 167만원, 사장은 186만원” 가게 접겠다는 업주들|last=Hyun-soo Kim, Ye-yoon Kim, Hye-ryeong Choi|first=|date=2017-07-17|work=동아일보|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko|trans-title="Part-time job salary is 16.7 million won, the president is 1.86 million won", Owners who want to stop shop}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[JoongAng Ilbo]] reported on the support measures for small businesses and small businesses, which amount to 4 trillion won, and criticized it as "unpopular populism all over the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.joins.com/article/21762475|title=국민 세금으로 메꾸는 최저임금 7530원|last=Nam-hyeon|first=Ha|date=2017-07-17|work=중앙일보|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko-KR|trans-title=Minimum wages and national taxes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[The Dong-a Ilbo|Dong-A Ilbo]] reported on companies that decided to move the factory overseas with a minimum wage increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20170725/85507191/1|title=“최저임금 너무 올라”… 한국 떠나는 기업들|last=Se-jin Jung, Do-young Kwak|first=|date=2017-07-25|work=동아일보|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko|trans-title="Minimum wage too high" ... Companies leaving Korea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ju Jin-hyung, who has served as general affairs policy committee chairman of [[Democratic Party of Korea|the Democratic Party]], pointed out through a [[Facebook]] post that the promise of the "minimum wage 10,000 won" promise and ambiguity, and lack of standard and impression standards.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/804396.html|title=최저임금 인상이 급격하다고? 찬반 논쟁 총정리|last=Da-hae|first=Park|date=2017-07-26|work=한겨레|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko|trans-title=The minimum wage increase is rapid? Pros and cons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars, however, welcome and endorse the minimum wage increase. Jeong Tae-in, an economist and chief of the Karl Polanyi Center for Socio-Economic Studies, wrote a column in the progressive journalist [[Kyunghyang Shinmun]]. He argued in the column that the minimum wage increase does not affect employment: first, college students and young people who work part-time will reduce labor hours if the minimum wage goes up. Second, if the self-employed are concerned about the minimum wage increase, it is likely that it is due to the pressures of a franchise headquarters. Third, he argues reducing business hours to 8 hours a day would not reduce the sales of consumer goods by one-third, as some insist. If the minimum wage increase is the policy priority, shortening the operating hours will be a policy to compensate. Convenience stores, franchisees, and manufacturing subcontractors, in short, the government only have to assure the right to organize '[[Gapjil|Eul(을)]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?code=990100&amp;artid=201707241121001|title=[정태인의 경제시평]최저임금 타령|last=Tae-in|first=Jeong|date=|work=경향신문|access-date=2018-06-10|language=ko|trans-title=[Economy of Chung Tae-in] Minimum wage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kim Chang-hwan, a professor of sociology at the [[University of Kansas]], USA, also objected to Ju Jin-hyung's argument. [http://sovidence.tistory.com/m/910 In his blog], he wrote, "The effect of the minimum hourly rate on the labor market is not established academically. The theory of economics suggests that if the minimum hourly rate is increased, the employment rate decreases. But the reality is that the minimum rate is cleaner than the theory." He also pointed out that there is a disagreement about whether it is bad for employment to decline by raising the minimum wage, and that high wages have the effect of promoting structural reforms and forcing productivity improvements. He said, "If businesses and self-employed people who can not afford the minimum wage are closed, the capital is absorbed into capital that can give more than the minimum wage, rather than being publicly decomposed." "In this case, the productivity of the economy as a whole is improved and structural upgrading is forced." Professor Kim also pointed out that the conservative press, which is promoting the 'minimization of employment by the minimum wage', is using the 'minimum wage increase' as a means of ideological struggle even though the new minimum wage is not applied yet. And he criticized Ju Jin-hyung, "If the minimum wage increase was a big problem, you should criticize the increase by 9% over 1989 and 12 times over 30 years. Until now, you have been quiet, but once the minimum wage raised the 16%, you can not criticize the minimum wage increase policy. If the Korean economy was ruined because the minimum wage was high, it would have been ruined."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Modified starch''', also called '''starch [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]]''', are prepared by [[physical change|physically]], [[enzymatically]], or [[chemically]] treating native [[starch]] to change its properties.&lt;ref name="Vaclavik"&gt;{{cite book | title = Essentials of food science | authors = "Vickie Vaclavik, Vickie A. Vaclavik, Elizabeth W. Christian" | edition = 3rd | publisher = Springer | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-387-69939-4 | page = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modified starches are used in practically all starch applications, such as in food products as a [[thickening agent]], [[Food additive#Categories|stabilizer]] or [[emulsifier]]; in [[pharmaceutical]]s as a [[Excipient#Disintegrants|disintegrant]]; or as binder in [[coated paper]]. They are also used in many other applications.&lt;ref&gt;Starch derivatization: fascinating and unique industrial opportunities, K. F. Gotlieb, A. Capelle, Wageningen Academic Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|978-90-76998-60-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starches are modified to enhance their performance in different applications. Starches may be modified to increase their stability against excessive heat, acid, shear, time, cooling, or freezing; to change their [[texture (food)|texture]]; to decrease or increase their [[viscosity]]; to lengthen or shorten [[starch gelatinization|gelatinization]] time; or to increase their [[visco-stability]].

==Modification methods==
[[File:Stärkeacetat.png|thumb|right|starch acetate]]
[[File:Hydroxypropylstärke.png|thumb|right|hydroxypropylated starch]]
[[File:Kationische Stärke.png|thumb|right|cationic starch]]
[[File:Carboxymethylstärke.png|thumb|right|carboxymethylated starch]]
Acid-treated starch ([[List of food additives, Codex Alimentarius|INS]] 1401),&lt;ref name="GSFA"&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.net/gsfaonline/docs/CXS_192e.pdf Codex General Standard for Food Additives (GSFA) Online Database]&lt;/ref&gt; also called thin boiling starch, is prepared by treating [[starch]] or starch granules with [[inorganic acid]]s, e.g. [[hydrochloric acid]] breaking down the starch molecule and thus reducing the viscosity.

Other treatments producing modified starch (with different INS and [[E-numbers]]) are:
* [[dextrin]] (INS 1400),&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt; roasted starch with [[hydrochloric acid]]
* alkaline-modified starch (INS 1402)&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt; with [[sodium hydroxide]] or [[potassium hydroxide]]
* bleached starch (INS 1403)&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt; with [[hydrogen peroxide]]
* oxidized starch (INS 1404, E1404)&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt; with [[sodium hypochlorite]], breaking down viscosity
* enzyme-treated starch (INS 1405),&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt; [[maltodextrin]], [[cyclodextrin]]
* monostarch phosphate (INS 1410, E1410) with [[phosphorous acid]] or the salts [[sodium phosphate]], [[potassium phosphate]], or [[sodium triphosphate]] to reduce [[retrogradation (starch)|retrogradation]] 
* [[Phosphated distarch phosphate|distarch phosphate]] (INS 1412, E1412) by esterification with for example [[sodium trimetaphosphate]],  [[Cross-link|crosslinked]] starch modifying the [[rheology]], the texture
* acetylated starch (INS 1420, E1420)&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt; [[esterification]] with [[acetic anhydride]]
* hydroxypropylated starch (INS 1440, E1440), starch [[ether]], with [[propylene oxide]], increasing viscosity stability 
* [[hydroxyethyl starch]], with [[ethylene oxide]]
* starch sodium octenyl succinate (OSA) starch (INS 1450, E1450) used as [[emulsifier]] adding [[hydrophobicity]]
* starch aluminium octenyl Succinate (INS 1452, E1452)
* [[Paper chemicals#Cationic starch|cationic starch]], adding positive [[electrical charge]] to starch 
* carboxymethylated starch with [[monochloroacetic acid]] adding negative charge 
and combined modifications such as 
*[[phosphated distarch phosphate]] (INS 1413, E1413)
* acetylated distarch phosphate (INS 1414, E1414)
* acetylated distarch adipate (INS 1422, E1422), 
* [[hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate]] (INS 1442, E1442), 
* acetylated oxidized starch (INS 1451, E1451).&lt;ref name="GSFA" /&gt;

Modified starch may also be a cold-water-soluble, pregelatinized or instant starch which thickens and gels without heat, or a cook-up starch which must be cooked like regular starch. Drying methods to make starches cold-water-soluble are [[Food extrusion|extrusion]], [[drum drying]], [[spray drying]] or [[dextrin]]ization.

Other starch derivatives, the starch sugars, like [[glucose]], [[high fructose syrup]], [[glucose syrup]]s, [[maltodextrin]]s, starch degraded with [[amylase]] [[enzyme]] are mainly sold as liquid [[syrup]] to make a [[Sugar substitute|sweetener]].

==Examples of use and functionality of modified starch==
Pre-gelatinized starch is used to thicken instant [[dessert]]s, allowing the food to thicken with the addition of cold water or milk. Similarly, cheese sauce granules (such as in [[Macaroni and Cheese]] or [[lasagna]]) or [[gravy]] granules may be thickened with boiling water without the product going lumpy. Commercial [[pizza topping]]s containing modified starch will thicken when heated in the oven, keeping them on top of the pizza, and then become runny when cooled.

A suitably modified starch is used as a [[fat substitute]] for low-fat versions of traditionally fatty foods, e.g. [[food industry|industrial]] milk-based desserts like [[yogurt]] or reduced-fat hard [[salami]] having about 1/3 the usual fat content.  For the latter type of uses, it is an alternative to the product [[Olestra]].

Modified starch is added to frozen products to prevent them from dripping when defrosted. Modified starch, bonded with [[phosphate]], allows the starch to absorb more water and keeps the ingredients together. Modified starch acts as an emulsifier for [[French dressing]] by enveloping oil droplets and suspending them in the water. Acid-treated starch forms the shell of [[jelly bean]]s. Oxidized starch increases the stickiness of [[batter (cooking)|batter]].

Carboxymethylated starches are used as a [[wallpaper adhesive]], as [[textile printing]] thickener, as [[Tablet (pharmacy)|tablet]] [[Excipient|disintegrants]] and [[excipients]] in the pharmaceutical industry.

[[Cation]]ic starch is used as wet end [[sizing]] agent in [[paper machine|paper manufacturing]].

==Genetically modified starch==
Modified starch should not be confused with [[genetically modified food|genetically modified]] starch, which refers to starch from [[genetically modified organism|genetically engineered plants]], such as those that have been genetically modified to produce novel fatty acids or carbohydrates which might not occur in the plant species being harvested. In the United States the term can also refer to foods that have been created by traditional cross-breeding rather than gene splicing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/testimony/ucm115032.htm 1999 October 19, Statement of James H. Maryanski Ph.D, Biotechnology Coordinator, Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, Food and Drug Administration].&lt;/ref&gt; {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}{{Dubious|date=January 2011}} In Europe the term "[[genetically modified organism|Genetically Modified Organism]]" is used solely where "the genetic material has been altered in a way that does not occur naturally through fertilisation and/or natural recombination".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/topics/topic/genetically-modified-organisms, European food Standards Agency, 24 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The modification in "genetically modified" refers to the genetic engineering of the plant [[DNA]], whereas in the term "Modified Starch" seen on [[Mandatory labelling|mandatory]] [[Ingredients|ingredient]] [[Food labelling Regulations|labels]] it refers to the later processing or treatment of the starch or starch granules.

Genetically modified starch is of interest in the manufacture of [[biodegradable polymer]]s and noncellulose feedstock in the [[paper industry]], as well as the creation of new [[food additives]]. For example, researchers aim to alter the enzymes within living plants to create starches with desirable modified properties, and thus eliminate the need for enzymatic processing after starch is extracted from the plant.&lt;ref&gt;Zeeman et al. "Starch: Its Metabolism, Evolution, and Biotechnological Modification in Plants" in Annual Review of Plant Biology, 2010, http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-arplant-042809-112301&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a partial list of well-documented instances of [[Electoral fraud#Ballot stuffing|ballot stuffing]].
* In the [[Electoral district of Cook#1883 election|1883 election for the district of Cook]], in [[Queensland, Australia]], arrests were made in connection with accusations of ballot stuffing, and the election committee subsequently changed the result of the election.
* The [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] has suffered from ballot stuffing more than once.
** In [[1957 Major League Baseball All-Star Game#Cincinnati voting controversy|1957]], [[Cincinnati Reds]] fans arranged for seven of the eight elected starting fielders to be Reds players.
** In 1999, the online ballot was stuffed in favor of [[Nomar Garciaparra]].
** In [[2015 Major League Baseball All-Star Game#Fan balloting|2015]], Major League Baseball annulled 65 million (out of a total of 620 million) online ballots.
** During election day of the [[2018 Russian Presidential Election]], there were multiple instances, some caught on camera, throughout Russia of voters and polling-staff alike stuffing multiple votes for incumbent President, Vladimir Putin in the ballot box.

'''People's Initiative''' (or "'''PI'''") is a common appellative in the [[Philippines]] that refers to either a mode for constitutional amendment provided by the 1987 Philippine Constitution or to the act of pushing an [[initiative]] (national or local) allowed by the Philippine Initiative and Referendum Act of 1987. The appellative also refers to the product of either of those initiatives.

The provision in the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines]] allowing for a "people's initiative" as one of the modes for [[constitutional amendment]] has been called the "people's initiative clause." The other modes allowed by the Constitution involve a [[Constituent Assembly (Philippines)|Constituent Assembly]] (or "Con-Ass") or a [[Constitutional Convention (Philippines)|Constitutional Convention]] (or "Con-Con"), both of which also allow a total revision of the charter.

The appellation (also known as "PI") also refers to the act—allowed by the law-given [[right]] of the [[Filipino people]]—of [[direct democracy|directly]] initiating [[statutes]] or calling for [[referenda]] on both the [[central government|national]] and the [[local government]] level.

== Constitutional amendment initiatives ==
The process of [[Constitutional reform in the Philippines|amending the 1987 Constitution of the Philippines]] is popularly known to many Filipinos as [[Charter Change]]. Any proposed amendment or revision must be ratified by the majority of Filipinos in a plebiscite.

Article XVII, Section 2 of the Constitution states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered votes therein. No amendment under this section shall be authorized within five years following the ratification of this Constitution nor oftener than once every five years thereafter.

The Congress shall provide for the implementation of the exercise of this right.

An [[enabling act|enabling law]] for this Article XVII, Section 2 Philippine Constitutional provision, called the Initiative and Referendum Act, was authored in 1987 by senators [[Raul Roco]] ([[Aksyon Demokratiko]]) and [[Neptali Gonzales]] ([[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]]) and was passed by the [[Eighth Congress of the Philippines]] in 1989. The law provides for the implementation of the exercise of the people's right to initiate a [[petition]] to amend the Constitution, with the Election Registrar of the [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (Comelec) tasked under the law with the verification of the petition signatures' being by at least twelve per centum of the total number of registered voters in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6735_1989.html|title = AN ACT PROVIDING FOR A SYSTEM OF INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM AND APPROPRIATING FUNDS THEREFOR|date = |accessdate = 30 September 2014|website = The LAWPHIL Project|publisher = [[Arellano Law Foundation]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute and referendum initiatives==
The People's Initiative can also refer to the right of Filipinos to initiate statutes as well as call for referenda on both the national and local government level, a right given by the Initiative and Referendum Act of 1987, otherwise known as [[Republic Act#Notable Laws|Republic Act 6735]].

===2014 People's Initiative Against Pork Barrel===
From late June to early August 2014, a People's Initiative Against Pork Barrel (PIAP) was repeatedly announced as up for launch in a forthcoming August 23 "people's congress" in [[Cebu City]]. The initiative, a multisectoral [[political alliance|alliance]]-driven proposition to [[criminalize]] [[pork barrel]] fund creation and spending, was led by various groups and individuals including Cebu Archbishop [[Jose S. Palma]], the broad #AbolishPorkMovement, the [[Catholic Church]]-backed Cebu Coalition Against the Pork Barrel System, the Church People's Alliance Against Pork Barrel, ePIRMA (Empowered People's Initiative and Reform Movement Alliance), the [[Makabayan]] Coalition (principally through [[Bayan Muna]] [[party-list]] representative [[Neri Colmenares]]), the Solidarity for Transformation, Youth Act Now, the Scrap Pork Network, and former [[Philippine Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[Reynato Puno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://bulatlat.com/main/2014/07/08/peoples-initiative-vs-pork-barrel-political-dynasty-gets-support-of-cbcp/|title = People's Initiative vs pork barrel, political dynasty gets support of CBCP|last = Salamat|first = Marya|date = 8 July 2014|work = Bulatlat.com|accessdate = 12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/368021/news/nation/people-s-initiative-set-vs-pork-barrel-funds|title = People's initiative set vs. pork barrel funds|last = Arcangel|first = Xianne|date = 30 June 2014|work = [[GMA News Online]]|accessdate = 12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/374086/news/nation/cbcp-president-supports-people-s-initiative-vs-pork-barrel|title = CBCP president supports people's initiative vs. pork barrel|last = Locsin|first = Joel|date = 9 August 2014|work = GMA News Online|accessdate = }} Retrieved August 12, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=39423 Bishops back people's initiative against pork barrel]".

The proposition was one of civil society's resulting reactions to the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund scam]] of 2013 and the [[Million People March]] and other protests that followed. An exploratory "people's congress" to draft an initiative on spending public funds was first convened by the ePIRMA at the [[Asian Institute of Management]] Conference Center on November 9, 2013, with Puno, Colmenares and ePIRMA's legal-team head Jose M. Roy III leading the conference that was attended by representatives from various groups coming from all over the country. ePIRMA and the "people's congress" alliance later scheduled its first draft to be completed by January 2014 while it was awaiting the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]'s decision on prior petitions against both the [[Priority Development Assistance Fund]] (PDAF) and the "presidential pork" disbursements under [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s government's Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.manilatimes.net/broad-alliance-to-hold-peoples-congress-today/51515/|title = Broad alliance to hold People's Congress today|date = November 8, 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = [[The Manila Times]]|publisher = |last =Villamente |first =Jing }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.mb.com.ph/e-p-i-r-m-a-peoples-congress/|title = E.P.I.R.M.A. People's Congress|last = Vicoy|first = Ali|date = November 9, 2013|work = [[Manila Bulletin]]|accessdate = August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://manilastandardtoday.com/2013/11/10/-people-s-move-vs-pork-barrel-needs-p750m-/|title = People's move vs. pork barrel needs P750M|date = 10 November 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = [[Manila Standard Today]]|publisher = |last =Araja |first =Rio N. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://1rgcruz.wordpress.com/2013/11/06/peoples-congress/|title = People's Congress|date = 6 November 2013|accessdate = August 12, 2014|website = @1RGCruz|publisher = R.G.

Petitions against the PDAF were first filed with the Supreme Court by the [[Social Justice Society]] on August 28, 2013, by [[Greco Belgica]] et al. on September 3, 2013, and by Pedrito Nepomuceno on September 5, 2013. Petitions against the DAP were filed with the Supreme Court by nine separate groups of petitioners between October 7 and November 7, 2013. The petitioners included the [[Integrated Bar of the Philippines]], Bagong Alyansang Makabayan, [[GABRIELA Women's Party]], Bayan Muna, [[Ang Kapatiran]], and Belgica, among others. On November 19, 2013, the Supreme Court declared the PDAF unconstitutional;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/11/19/1258492/sc-declares-pdaf-unconstitutional|title = SC declares PDAF unconstitutional|last = Diola|first = Camille|date = November 19, 2013|work =[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate = August 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/microsite/pdaf/|title = Main Decision: Priority Development Assistance Fund|date = November 20, 2013|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = sc.judiciary.gov.ph|publisher = [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]]|last =Perlas-Bernabe |first =Estela M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; a decision on the DAP came out seven and a half months later, on July 1, 2014, also declaring basic parts of the program as unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/63267-understanding-supreme-court-ruling-dap|title = Understanding the SC ruling on the DAP|date = July 14–17, 2014|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Rappler.com|publisher =[[Rappler]] |last = Hofileña|first = Chay F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.rappler.com/business/features/63691-dap-supreme-court-say|title = DAP: What did the Supreme Court really say?|date = July 18–19, 2014|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Rappler.com|publisher =Rappler |last = Geronimo|first = Gerry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sc.judiciary.gov.ph/microsite/dap/|title = Main Decision: Disbursement Acceleration Program|date = July 2, 2014|accessdate = August 26, 2014|website = Sc.judiciary.gov.ph|publisher = Supreme Court of the Philippines|last =Bersamin |first =Lucas P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the PIAP's proposed Pork Barrel Abolition Act, all budgets submitted to any legislative body shall contain only itemized appropriations, except funds for relief and [[rescue operation]]s during [[calamities]] and funds for [[espionage|intelligence work]] and security. The proposed legislation also called for the abolition of the Presidential Social Fund, which has also been described as a form of pork barrel. Violators of this law were to be banned for life from holding public office.&lt;ref name="Pols"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/668396/pols-obstacles-in-bid-vs-pork-says-bishop|title = Pols obstacles in bid vs pork, says bishop|last = Mayol|first = Ador Vincent|date = January 28, 2015|work = Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date = February 18, 2015|last2 = Matus|first2 = Carmel Loise}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 2014, the ''[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] ''reported that the Philippine Commission on Elections received the first 10,000 signatures from the initiative thrust in [[Quezon City]]. The signatures were from the city's first six districts, a first installment of the required 177,000 signatures from the entire city territory. Meanwhile, PIAP-[[Metro Manila]] coordinator Mark Lui Aquino said they had yet to submit to the Comelec the 50,000 to 100,000 signatures they had gathered in the metropolis. PIAP-Quezon City spokesperson Malou Turalde said, however, that Quezon City was not the first to submit to the Comelec gathered signatures for the initiative, adding that other legislative districts "just want to be quiet." Aquino also expressed fear that the "Comelec seems unready" and added that, based on his group's monitoring, the Comelec offices in the different cities and municipalities "do not know what to do with the signatures."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/652823/anti-pork-barrel-group-submits-10000-signatures-from-qc-for-peoples-initiative|title = Anti-pork barrel group submits 10,000 signatures from QC for people's initiative|last = Granali|first = Rima|date = November 25, 2014|work = Inquirer.net|access-date = December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Malacañang's resistance to the initiative ====
On September 4, 2014, Rep. Neri Colmenares announced that the ruling Liberal Party was trying to undermine the people's initiative against the pork barrel system. During his interpellation on the same day, at the [[16th Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]] budget committee hearing on the 2015 budget for the Philippine [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]], Colmenares noticed that the [[Malacañang Palace]] and its allies in Congress took out the budget that they had placed for a charter change (Cha-Cha) referendum they were planning to launch. Colmenares asked for the budget to be reinserted for the people's initiative plebiscite, but budget committee vice-chair Dakila Cua (Liberal Party, formerly [[Lakas Kampi CMD]]) said that Colmenares's motion should be made during the committee deliberations on the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/09/04/14/palace-undermining-peoples-initiative-lawmaker|title = Palace undermining People's Initiative - lawmaker|last = Cruz|first = R.G.|date = September 4, 2014|work =[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs]] |accessdate = September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of Liberal Party leaders and spokesmen earlier announced their wish to amend the Constitution to allow President [[Benigno Aquino III]] to run for re-election; as under the present Constitution the President cannot run again for the same office after his single six-year term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/628668/issue-of-aquino-2nd-term-divides-liberal-party|title = Issue of Aquino 2nd term divides Liberal Party|last = Cabacungan|first = Gil C.|date = August 13, 2014|work =Philippine Daily Inquirer |accessdate = September 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, groups against the pork barrel noted that the Aquino government had drafted a national budget for 2015 that still contained "pork" in the form of "special purpose funds," thus ignoring the earlier SC ruling on such funds' unconstitutionality as well as salient points in the PIAP. The groups further noted that this pork budget allocation had ballooned to 27 billion pesos, from the previous year's PHP25 billion pesos.The groups urged Congress to junk the budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/646082/congress-urged-to-junk-2015-budget-due-to-pro-dap-provisions|title = Congress urged to junk 2015 budget due to pro-DAP provisions|last = Gamil|first = Jaymee T.|date = October 21, 2014|work = Inquirer.net|accessdate = October 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, during the Senate plenary session tackling the said budget, Senator [[Miriam Defensor-Santiago]] raised the same points raised by the Makabayan group in the House of Representatives hearings, boosting the Makabayan position on the budget bill amendments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/11/26/14/makabayan-finds-ally-miriam-pushes-forward-pi-vs-pork|title = Makabayan finds ally in Miriam, pushes forward with PI vs pork|last = Cruz|first = R.G.|date = November 26, 2014|work = ABS-CBNNews.com|access-date = December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Palma reiterated the importance of the initiative, saying that although the Supreme Court had already declared the Priority Development Assistance Fund (PDAF) and the Disbursement Acceleration Program (DAP) as unconstitutional funds, members of Congress continued to enjoy discretionary funds under other forms.&lt;ref name="Pols" /&gt;

==== Attack on anti-pork campaigner ====
On September 29, 2014, minutes after the anti-pork forum in [[Tagum City]], [[Davao del Norte]], which also launched the PIAP in the province, Dexter Ian Selebrado, 32, of the group Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas - Davao del Norte (Farmers' Movement of the Philippines - Davao del Norte) and one of the local campaigners against pork barrel funds, was attacked by motorcycle-riding gunmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.rappler.com/nation/70566-anti-pork-barrel-slay-try|title = Anti-pork activist attacked by gunmen in Davao|last = Manlupig|first = Karlos|date = September 30, 2014|work = Rappler|accessdate = September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 1, the farmer-activist was still in critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/10/01/14/pnoy-urged-probe-shooting-anti-pork-leader|title = PNoy urged to probe shooting of anti-pork leader|last = |first = |date = October 1, 2014|work = ABS-CBNews.com|accessdate = October 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Politicians' resistance to the initiative ====
In his January 2015 [[news conference|conference with the press]], Palma lamented the intervention of [[politicians]] in the turnout of citizens at the signature centers in his [[parishes]]. Apart from a lack of knowledge about the pork barrel, Palma claimed that a low turnout was also a result of there being families who had children enrolled in schools under politicians' pork-funded [[scholarships]] whose relatives then refused to sign the proposition. Turnout results in other [[dioceses]] were also not good, he said. He promised, however, that the Church would not be disheartened and cited the strong support of people in such dioceses as [[Calbayog City]].&lt;ref name="Pols" /&gt;

==== The initiative and the pork barrel issue by 2016 ====
In his blog of July 4, 2016, direct democracy advocate Jojo Soria de Veyra, a member of ePIRMA, confessed that after the initiative's launch "the signature gathering was mostly left to certain parishes of the more organized Catholic Church, the primary backing of the Cebu Coalition. Sporadic rallies of support were organized by the Makabayan group and provincial groups. Other members of ePIRMA were seen to have moved on to various other national concerns. [[Manny SD Lopez]]—ePIRMA's leading convenor and most active campaigner on the road—would also busy himself with organizing the Christian Peace Alliance, one of the groups advocating for a drastic review of some provisions of the then-in-its-final-thrust [[Bangsamoro Basic Law]]. Lopez would also form the EdlSA 2.22.15 Coalition, a group that called for President Benigno Aquino III's resignation after the [[Mamasapano clash|Mamasapano mishap]]. I submit that in this latter period I was not privy anymore to how the signature-gathering for the initiative on the pork barrel was progressing. I did hear of some pockets of resistance to the initiative, as well as the Comelec's seeming lack of enthusiasm towards verifying the signatures, but that's about it. . . . Then came the various noises leading to the [[Philippine general election, 2016|2016 general election]], within which news concerning the initiative's progress were nowhere anymore to be found on Google." De Veyra, also a convenor of a Facebook group called Forum for Direct Democracy, then proceeded in his blog to propose amendments to the Initiative and Referendum Act that would make the law easier for the people to use as well as obligate Comelec to do its part in the initiative process within a limited time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jojosoriadeveyra.blogspot.com/2016/07/my-amendment-proposals-to-initiative.html|title=Social / -Isms: My amendment proposals re the Initiative and Referendum Act (RA 6735)|last=Veyra|first=Jojo Soria De|date=2016-07-04|website=Social / -Isms|access-date=2016-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on August 31, Senator [[Panfilo Lacson]] told the media that "the ₱3.35-trillion proposed budget presented by Malacañang [under the newly-elected [[Presidency of Rodrigo Duterte|Duterte administration]]] to the Senate for congressional approval is laden with 'pork' and violated the Supreme Court rulings on the Priority Development Assistance Fund and Disbursement Acceleration Program."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thestandard.com.ph/news/-main-stories/top-stories/214832/lacson-2017-budget-laden-with-pork-barrel.html|title=Lacson: 2017 budget laden with pork barrel|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14038">In the context of [[Sovereign default|sovereign debt crisis]], '''private sector involvement''' ('''PSI''') refers, broadly speaking, to the contributions or efforts of [[private sector]] creditors to the crisis resolution process, and, specifically,  means that the private sector shares some of the costs of a [[financial crisis]] by incurring itself financial losses.&lt;ref name=refers&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpops/ecbocp32.pdf |last=|first= |last2= |first2= |last3=|first3=|date=July 2005 |title= Managing Financial Crises in Emerging Market-Economies: Experience with the Involvement of Private Sector Creditors|journal=Occasional Paper Series|publisher=[[European Central Bank|ECB]]|volume=|issue=32 |pages=|bibcode= |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}
==History==
The term "private sector involvement" was introduced in the late-1990s in the context of the discussions on [[bond (finance)|bond]] restructurings and [[capital account]] crises.&lt;ref name=refers/&gt;{{rp|6}}

Previously, the term used to broadly denote any kind of private-sector participation into an existing government program, such as, for example, [[family planning]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpc.unc.edu/measure/prh/rh_indicators/crosscutting/ps "Private Sector Involvement in Family Planning"], the Family Planning and Reproductive Health Indicators Database&lt;/ref&gt; or [[health care]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=Ian |last2=McCabe |first2=Christopher |date=12 April 2011|title=The NHS braces itself for privatisation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/12/private-sector-involvement-nhs |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has come to signify specifically the private sector's participation in the losses taken in cases of [[sovereign debt]] [[write down]]s.&lt;ref name=cline&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cline  |first=William R. |last2=|first2= |last3=|first3=|date=November 2002 |url=https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2772_file_cgd_wp018.pdf|title=Private Sector Involvement in Financial Crisis Resolution: Definition, Measurement, and Implementation |journal=Working Papers|publisher=[[Center for Global Development]] |volume=|issue=18 |pages= |bibcode=|doi=|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imf1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=J5otDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1475539061&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIwZHAgNvbAhWCIlAKHfMEBFAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Portugal : Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access Under the 2011 Extended Arrangement|last= |first=|series=Country Report No. 16/302 |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=September 2016 |website= |access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swap&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/11/30/to-swap-or-not-to-swap-greece-issues-5-new-bonds/|title=To swap or not to swap?

==Justification==
The private sector involvements covers measures such as the rescheduling, reprofiling, and restructuring of the state-debt holdings of private creditors, in the context of the resolution of a sovereign debt crisis.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/mobu/mb201110en.pdf |last=|first= |last2= |first2= |last3=|first3=|date=October 2011 |title=Private sector involvement and its financial stability implications  |journal=Monthly Bulletin|publisher=[[European Central Bank|ECB]]|volume= |pages=43-49 |bibcode= |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|43}} According to the [[International Monetary Fund]], the measures of the private sector involvement process are appropriate in order to "have the burden of crisis resolution shared equitably with the [state] sector," as well as to "strengthen market discipline."&lt;ref name=imf2/&gt;
==Implications==
ECB Executive Board member [[Lorenzo Bini Smaghi]] has warned in 2011 that the enforcement of private sector involvement in resolving a financial crisis inside the [[Eurozone]] would incur "a series of problems": The taxpayers of the creditor countries would suffer in any case; patient investors, who have stuck to their investment, would be punished;  the measure would destabilize the financial markets of the Eurozone by creating incentives for short-term speculative behavior; and it would delay the return of the debtor nation to the markets since market participants would be unwilling to start reinvesting in the country for a long period. This, Smaghi stated, would oblige the state sector to eventually increase its financial contribution.&lt;ref name=smaghi&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2011/html/sp110606.en.html|title=Private sector involvement: From (good) theory to (bad) practice|last=Bini Smaghi |first=Lorenzo|author-link=Lorenzo Bini Smaghi|publisher=[[European Central Bank|ECB]] |date=6 June 2011 |website=Speech at the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee|access-date=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context==
Although the term used to denote any kind of private-sector participation into an existing government program, such as, for example, [[family planning]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpc.unc.edu/measure/prh/rh_indicators/crosscutting/ps "Private Sector Involvement in Family Planning"], the Family Planning and Reproductive Health Indicators Database&lt;/ref&gt; or [[health care]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kirkpatrick|first1=Ian |last2=McCabe |first2=Christopher |date=12 April 2011|title=The NHS braces itself for privatisation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/apr/12/private-sector-involvement-nhs |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has come to signify the private sector's participation in the losses taken in cases of [[sovereign debt]] [[write down]]s,&lt;ref name=cline&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cline  |first=William R. |last2=|first2= |last3=|first3=|date=November 2002 |url=https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/2772_file_cgd_wp018.pdf|title=Private Sector Involvement in Financial Crisis Resolution: Definition, Measurement, and Implementation |journal=Working Papers|publisher=[[Center for Global Development]] |volume=|issue=18 |pages= |bibcode=|doi=|access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imf1&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=J5otDQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:1475539061&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjIwZHAgNvbAhWCIlAKHfMEBFAQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Portugal : Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access Under the 2011 Extended Arrangement|last= |first=|series=Country Report No. 16/302 |publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=September 2016 |website= |access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=swap&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2017/11/30/to-swap-or-not-to-swap-greece-issues-5-new-bonds/|title=To swap or not to swap? Greece issues 5 new bonds |last=Pelagidis |first=Theodore |publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] |date=30 November 2017 |website= |access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, more specifically, "any kind of...contributions of the private sector in the context of sovereign financial distress."&lt;ref name=sense&gt;{{cite journal |last=Enderlein |first=Henrik |last2= Müller|first2=Laura |last3=Trebesch |first3=Christoph  |date=8 September 2006 |url=http://www.sfb-governance.de/teilprojekte/projekte_phase_1/projektbereich_d/d4/Enderlein_M__ller_Trebesch__Garnetconf_2006.pdf|title=Making Sense of PSI : On the role of the private sector in sovereign debt crises |journal=|publisher=Hertie School of Governance|place=Berlin |volume= |pages= |bibcode=|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of the [[International Monetary Fund]], private sector involvement "in the resolution of financial crises is appropriate in order to have the burden of crisis resolution shared equitably with the official sector, strengthen market discipline, and, in the process, increase the efficiency of international capital markets and the ability of emerging market borrowers to protect themselves against volatility and contagion."&lt;ref name=imf2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/privsec.htm|title=The IMF and the Private Sector|last= |first=|publisher=[[International Monetary Fund]]|date=August 2001 |website= |access-date=17 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fund claims that "a broad consensus has emerged among IMF member countries on the need to seek PSI in the resolution of crises."&lt;ref name=imf2/&gt; According to [[William R. Cline]], “'PSI' has been the 1990s equivalent of 'bailing in the banks' in the 1980s."&lt;ref name=cline/&gt;

==Greek sovereign-debt crisis== 
The most prominent case of PSI occurred in the process of the sovereign-debt restructuring of [[Greece]], after a significant [[Haircut (finance)|haircut]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;"Haircut: A reduction in the [[face value]] of a troubled borrower's debts ([https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33311405 BBC], 2015); a reduction of the amount that will be repaid to creditors ([https://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/19/why-the-imf-is-wrong-on-a-greek-debt-haircut.html CNBC], 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; of it was [[Greek_government_debt_crisis#Second_rescue_package_.28July_2011_-_February_2012.29|agreed]], in early 2012. The so-called "world's biggest debt-restructuring deal in history"&lt;ref name=how&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/29/us-europe-greece-idUSTRE81S0NP20120229 "How the Greek debt puzzle was solved"], Reuters, 29 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=concedes/&gt;{{rp|1}} affecting some €206bn of bonds, occurred in February 2012, when the [[Eurogroup]] finalized a second [[Greek government-debt crisis|bailout package for Greece]].&lt;ref name=group&gt;[http://consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/ecofin/128075.pdf Statement] by the [[Eurogroup]], 21 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[European Union|EU]] member-states agreed to a new €100 billion loan and a retroactive lowering of the bailout interest rates, while the [[International Monetary Fund]] would provide "a significant contribution" to that loan.&lt;ref name=group /&gt; Part of that deal was the agreement for private-sector involvement (PSI), whereby private investors were asked to accept to write off 53.5% of the face value of the Greek governmental bonds they're holding, the equivalent to an overall loss of around 75%.&lt;Ref name=group /&gt;

If not enough private-sector bondholders were to agree to participate in the bond swap per the PSI requirement, the Greek government threatened to retroactively introduce a [[collective action clause]] to enforce participation.&lt;ref name=sud&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/geld-fuer-griechenland-freigegeben-das-rettungspaket-kommt-die-zweifel-bleiben-1.1289418 "Das Rettungspaket kommt, die Zweifel bleiben"] ("The bailout comes, the doubts remain"),  ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 21 February 2012, (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, private-sector involvement reached 83,5% of Greek bond holders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iif.com/press/press+239.php Statement] by [[Charles Dallara]] and [[Jean Lemierre]], Co-Chairs, Steering Committee of the Private Creditor-Investor Committee for Greece, [[Institute of International Finance]], 9 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bank of Greece]], in its 2011/12 report, commented that "the successful completion of the PSI, creates a new operating framework for the Greek economy in the years ahead."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.bankofgreece.gr/pages/en/bank/news/pressreleases/DispItem.aspx?Item_ID=3882&amp;List_ID=1af869f3-57fb-4de6-b9ae-bdfd83c66c95&amp;Filter_by=DT The Bank of Greece Report on Monetary Policy 2011-2012]", [[Bank of Greece]], 19 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal aspects==
Certain official measures executed during Greece's state debt restructuring process and the subsequent private sector involvement were not covered by existing [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] provisions for [[Credit default swap|CDS]] contracts, as the [[International Monetary Fund]] conceded.&lt;ref name=concedes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Liu  |first=Yan |last2=Bergthaler |first2=Wolfgang |last3=Giddings |first3=Andrew |last4=Kosonen |first4=Amanda|last5=Papaioannou|first5=Michael|last6=Grigorian |first6=David |last7= Guscina |first7=Anastasia |last8=Presciuttini |first8=Gabriel |last9=Tsuda|first9=Takahiro |last10=Baqir |first10= Reza |url=https://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/042613.pdf|journal=Policy Papers|publisher=[[IMF]]| |date=26 April 2013|title=Sovereign Debt Restructuring: Recent Developments and Implications|volume= |pages= |access-date=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|33}} 

Therefore, according to the IMF, the typically expected [[credit event]] was not officially triggered, the negative contingencies to private holders of state debt were increased, while the credibility of the sovereign-[[Credit default swap|CDS]] market was undermined. The measures undertaken included the  "persuasion"&lt;ref group=note name=marks&gt;Quotation marks in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=concedes/&gt;{{rp|33}} of certain  Greek debt-holders to accept large [[Haircut (finance)|haircuts]] under a supposedly “voluntary PSI" agreement.&lt;ref group=note name=marks/&gt;&lt;ref name=concedes/&gt;{{rp|33}} Accordingly, Greece achieved a "very high creditor participation" of 97 percent of debt held, despite the restructuring being preemptive and, as assessed by the IMF,  having a  "very large" target of a 70 percent [[haircut (finance)|haircut]] of  the bonds' [[face value]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;In terms of [[net present value]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=concedes/&gt;{{rp|27}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5042">The '''Section carrément anti-[[Jean-Marie Le Pen|Le Pen]]''' (SCALP; "Absolutely anti-Le Pen group") is a French [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] and [[libertarian socialism|anarchist]] group,&lt;ref name="Serge Cosseron"&gt;Serge Cosseron, ''[[:fr:Dictionnaire de l'extreme gauche]]'', Paris, Larousse, 2007, p. 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt; formed in [[Toulouse]] in 1984 as a manifestation of the [[Autonomism|autonomist movement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://kinoks.org/spip.php?article115 « Le jingle sonore réalisé par le SCALP pour la manif du 5 mars 1985 »]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The success of a group by the name of SCALP (Société contre les amis de Le Pen - Society against the friends of [[Jean-Marie Le Pen|Le Pen]]) in attracting media attention at a rally in Toulouse on June 6, 1984 led to the creation of numerous other groups sharing the same acronym in different cities around France. This first wave of SCALPs, developing alongside the [[alternative rock]] movement,  disbanded in the early 1980s. An attempt to unite the different groups under a proposed National Anti-Fascist Representative Committee (''Coordination nationale antifasciste,'' CNAF) never took off, the Paris section of SCALP splintering in 1990.

==History==
After one or two years of dormancy, elements of the original Paris SCALP who had been running the magazine ''REFLEXes'' (so named because most contributors were former students of [[Paris X University Nanterre|Paris X University]]) revived SCALP, using the acronym and the mythos surrounding it to attract the interest of young recruits. At the same time, the new SCALP distanced itself from the [[autonomist movement]] (elements of the original SCALP loyal to this movement dedicated themselves to other organizations and projects such as Karoshi and the CNT-AIT), opting to align itself more closely with traditional libertarian groups. Some members later left to join the [[Confédération nationale du travail|National Confederation of Labour]].

In 1992, the new SCALP organized itself into a national network called No Pasaran Network - a federation of the different local SCALP groups. The Paris group became known as SCALP-REFLEX ('''''R'''éseau d''''é'''tudes sur le '''f'''ascisme et de '''l'''utte contre l''''e'''xtrême droite et la '''x'''énophobie'' - Network for the study of [[fascism]] and the fight against the [[far right]] and [[xenophobia]]). The radical measures taken by the network during their [[Direct action|actions]] resulted in damage to premises and public property.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

In 2004, more individuals quit the group, later going on to found the Libertarian and Social Offensive (''Offensive libertaire et sociale,'' OLS).

In 2006 SCALP-REFLEX participated in demonstrations and university ''assemblées générales''. They were involved in the occupation of the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences]] (''École  des hautes études en sciences sociales'', EHESS). Activists from the group clashed with those of the far right at a rally outside the [[Sorbonne]] on March 14, 2006.

On May 9, 2007 the group, along with other libertarian and student organisations ([[Alternative Libertaire]], [[Solidaires Unitaires Démocratiques|Union syndicale Solidaires]], [[Confédération nationale du travail|CNT]]), called for a counter-demonstration to be held to physically oppose a demonstration by the far right and to "show them they don't own the street." Fearing a police crackdown, the organisers - with the exception of SCALP - called for the counter-demonstration to be canceled. Several activists who attended the rally were arrested.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Current status==

If current estimates of the group's strength as between 400 and 500 members are correct, more than 6000 people may have passed through its ranks since its founding{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

Pornographic actress [[Ovidie]] is a former member of SCALP{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.

==Publications==

''No Pasaran'', the monthly publication of the network, is circulated in libraries and sectional offices. Numerous pamphlets on the [[far right]] have also been authored by the group.

In 2005 SCALP published ''Comme un indien Métropolitain'' (Like a French Indian), which deals with the history of the movement between 1984 and 1992.

The '''shadow government''' ('''cryptocracy''', '''secret government''', or '''invisible government''') is a family of [[conspiracy theories]] based on the notion that real and actual political power resides not with [[representative democracy|publicly elected representatives]] but with private individuals who are exercising power behind the scenes, beyond the scrutiny of democratic [[Institution|institution]]s. According to this belief, the official elected government is subservient to the shadow government which is the true executive power.

Some of the groups proposed by these theories as constituting the shadow government include [[central bank]]s; [[Masonic conspiracy theories|Freemasons]], [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]; [[think tanks]]; [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|organized Jewry]]; [[Holy See|the Vatican]]; [[secret societies]]; [[Jesuit conspiracy theories|Jesuits]]; [[Corporatocracy|moneyed interests]]; [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|globalist elites and supranational organizations]] who seek to manipulate policy in their own interest or in order to serve a larger agenda that is hidden from the general public.

==History==
Literature on the subject postulates the existence of a secret government which is the true power behind the apparent government. Examples of such literature include works by [[Dan Smoot]], [[William Guy Carr]], [[Jim Marrs]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Gary Allen]], [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]], [[Des Griffin]], [[G. Edward Griffin]], [[David Icke]], and [[Michael A. Hoffman II]]. Some of these authors believe members of the secret government may represent or be agents for groups such as the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], the [[Royal Institute for International Affairs]], the [[Trilateral Commission]], the [[Bilderberg Group]], [[CIA]] and [[MI6]] in co-operation with international banks and financial institutions such as the [[World Bank]] and the [[Bank for International Settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;Chatham House ([[Royal Institute for International Affairs|RIIA]]) and the [[Council on Foreign Relations|CFR]], its US sister organization, are the focus of Quigley's ''The Anglo-American Establishment''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The CFR as a central institution of the secret government of the United States is the focus of James Perloff's book ''The Shadows of Power''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Marrs cites all the institutions listed in this paragraph in his study ''Rule By Secrecy'', published by Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; Also popularizing the idea was the hit US television show, ''[[The X-Files]]''.

[[Milton William Cooper]] claimed that the shadow government was in cooperation with [[Extraterrestrials|extraterrestrial aliens]]. His 1991 book ''Behold A Pale Horse'',&lt;ref name="Barkun2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Barkun|title=A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiwjVsNBw-cC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=5 January 2012|date=4 May 2006|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-24812-0|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert Todd|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=9781118045633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll|accessdate=January 17, 2013|page=175|chapter=Illuminati|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; influential among "UFO and militia circles",&lt;ref name=Nattrass&gt;{{cite book|last=Nattrass|first=Nicoli|title=The AIDS Conspiracy: Science Fights Back|year=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231149129|pages=4, 23–27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TehyoBCpVHYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Nicoli Nattrass|accessdate=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes "the doings of the secret world government" and "a variety of other covert activities associated with the Illuminati's declaration of war upon the people of America".&lt;ref name=Gilroy&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilroy|first=Paul|title=Against Race: Imagining Political Culture Beyond the Color Line|year=2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=9780674000964|pages=352–353|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWpt-Js7JPEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Paul Gilroy|accessdate=January 17, 2013|chapter=Planetary Humanism|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wWpt-Js7JPEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA352#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper claimed to have seen secret documents while in the Navy describing governmental dealings with aliens. Cooper linked the [[Illuminati]] with his beliefs that extraterrestrials were secretly involved with the US government, but later retracted these claims. He accused [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] of negotiating a treaty with extraterrestrials in 1954, then establishing an inner circle of Illuminati to manage relations with them and keep their presence a secret from the general public. Cooper believed that aliens "manipulated and/or ruled the human race through various secret societies, religions, magic, witchcraft, and the occult", and that even the Illuminati were unknowingly being manipulated by them.&lt;ref name="Barkun2006" /&gt;

Cooper described the [[Illuminati]] as a secret international organization, controlled by the [[Bilderberg Group]], that conspired with the [[Knights of Columbus]], [[Freemasonry|Masons]], [[Skull and Bones]], and other organizations. Its ultimate goal, he said, was the establishment of a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]. According to Cooper the Illuminati conspirators not only invented alien threats for their own gain, but actively conspired with extraterrestrials to take over the world.&lt;ref name="Barkun2006" /&gt; Cooper believed that [[James Forrestal]]'s fatal fall from a window on the sixteenth floor of [[Walter Reed National Military Medical Center|Bethesda Hospital]] was connected to the alleged secret committee [[Majestic-12]], and that [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON advisory group]] scientists reported to an elite group of [[Trilateral Commission]] and [[Council on Foreign Relations]] executive committee members who were high-ranking members of the Illuminati.&lt;ref name="Landes2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Allen Landes|title=Heaven on Earth: The Varieties of the Millennial Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TulaFe5FTYC&amp;pg=PA418|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=4 August 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-975359-8|pages=418–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldwag2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Goldwag|title=Cults, Conspiracies, and Secret Societies: The Straight Scoop on Freemasons, the Illuminati, Skull and Bones, Black Helicopters, the New World Order, and Many, Many More|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DDbM5GeMgXIC|accessdate=4 January 2012|date=11 August 2009|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-307-39067-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''South End Press''' was a [[non-profit]] [[book publisher]] run on a model of [[participatory economics]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It was founded in 1977 by [[Michael Albert]],{{r|mase}} [[Lydia Sargent]], [[Juliet Schor]],{{r|ias}} among others, in [[Boston]]'s [[South End, Boston|South End]]. It published books written by [[political activism|political activists]], notably [[Arundhati Roy]], [[Noam Chomsky]], [[bell hooks]], [[Winona LaDuke]], [[Manning Marable]], [[Ward Churchill]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Jeremy Brecher]] and Scott Tucker. South End Press closed in 2014.

==History==
South End Press was founded in 1977 by [[Michael Albert]],{{r|mase}} [[Lydia Sargent]], John Schall, Pat Walker, [[Juliet Schor]],&lt;ref name=ias /&gt; Mary Lea, Joe Bowring, and Dave Millikan, among others. It was based in [[Boston]]'s [[South End, Boston|South End]] and run as a [[egalitarian]] [[collective]] with decision-making equally shared.

The publisher experienced financial difficulties in the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]], with sales dropping by 12.8% in 2008. In 2009, South End Press moved to a new office in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], partnering with [[Medgar Evers College]] of the [[City University of New York]].&lt;ref name=rosen2009 /&gt; A fundraising campaign was run in 2012 to help ease its financial situation.&lt;ref name=rosen2014 /&gt;

South End Press closed in July 2014. Howard Zinn and an anonymous author had reportedly not received royalties for several years.&lt;ref name=rosen2014 /&gt;

==Legacy==
Some of South End Press's catalogue has been republished including work by Howard Zinn, Noam Chomsky, Dana Frank and Vanessa Tait (on [[Haymarket Books]]), Jeremy Brecher (on [[PM Press]]),&lt;ref name=rosen2014 /&gt; and Eli Clare, Andrea Smith, Frank Wilderson and Dean Spade (on [[Duke University Press]]),&lt;ref name="duke" /&gt; and [[Vandana Shiva]] (on [[North Atlantic Books]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northatlanticbooks.com/blog/letter-from-the-publisher-vandana-shiva/|title=Letter from the Publisher: Vandana Shiva - North Atlantic Books|date=2015-08-21|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, commenting on the demise of the publisher, ''[[Monthly Review]]'' said it was ''"... an important and vital part of the overall left movement ... "''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://monthlyreview.org/2014/10/01/mr-066-05-2014-09_0/|title=October 2014 (Volume 66, Number 5) - The Editors - Monthly Review|author=|date=1 October 2014|website=monthlyreview.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[The WELL|Stewart]] Brand''' (born December 14, 1938) is an American writer, best known as editor of the ''[[Whole Earth Catalog]]''. He founded a number of organizations, including [[The WELL]], the [[Global Business Network]], and the [[Long Now Foundation]]. He is the author of several books, most recently ''[[Whole Earth Discipline|Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto]]''.

== Life ==
Brand attended [[Phillips Exeter Academy]]. He studied [[biology]] at [[Stanford University]], graduating in 1960.  In 1966, he married [[mathematician]] Lois Jennings, an [[Odawa people|Ottawa]] [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]].&lt;ref name="Brand 2009, p. 236"&gt;Brand 2009, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; As a soldier in the [[U.S.&amp;nbsp;Army]], he was a [[parachutist]] and taught [[infantry]] skills; he later expressed the view that his experience in the military had fostered his competence in organizing.&lt;ref name="Brand in Big Thing Interview 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-stewart-brand|title=Big Think Interview With Stewart Brand - Big Think|author=Stewart Brand|work=Big Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A civilian again in 1962, he studied design at [[San Francisco Art Institute]], photography at [[San Francisco State College]], and participated in a legitimate scientific study of then-legal [[LSD]], in [[Menlo Park, California]].

Brand has lived in California since the 1960s. He and his second wife live on ''Mirene'', a {{convert|64|ft|adj=on}}-long working [[tugboat]]. Built in 1912, the boat is moored in a former shipyard in [[Sausalito, California]].&lt;ref name=Lewine&gt;{{cite news|author=Lewine, Edward|title=On the Waterfront|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/magazine/19wwln-domains-t.html|date=April 19, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He works in  ''Mary Heartline'', a grounded fishing boat about 100 yards (90 metres) away.&lt;ref name=Lewine /&gt; A favorite item of his is a table on which [[Otis Redding]] is said to have written "[[(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay]]". (Brand acquired it from an [[antiques]] dealer in Sausalito.)&lt;ref name=Lewine /&gt;

==Merry Pranksters==
By the mid-1960s, Brand became associated with author [[Ken Kesey]] and the "[[Merry Pranksters]]". With his partner [[Ramón Sender Barayón]], he produced the [[Acid Tests#The Trips Festival|Trips Festival]] in [[San Francisco]], an early effort involving rock music and [[Liquid light shows|light shows]]. This was one of the first venues at which the [[Grateful Dead]] performed in San Francisco. About 10,000 [[hippies]] attended, and [[Haight-Ashbury]] soon emerged as a community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Brand, Stewart|title=From Counterculture to Cyberculture: The Legacy of the Whole Earth Catalog|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9001613451407405270#|publisher=Stanford University Libraries via Google|time=32:30|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Wolfe]] describes Brand in the beginning of his 1968 book, ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''.

==NASA images of Earth==

[[File:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg|thumb|''[[Earthrise]]'', by [[William Anders]], [[Apollo 8]], 1968.]]

In 1966, Brand campaigned to have [[NASA]] release the then-rumored [[satellite]] image of the entire Earth as seen from space. He sold and distributed buttons for 25 cents each&lt;ref name=Brand-Smithsonian&gt;{{cite web|author=Brand, Stewart|title=Photography changes our relationship to our planet|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530221651/http://click.si.edu/Story.aspx?story=31|publisher=Smithsonian Photography Initiative|accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking, "Why haven't we seen a photograph of the whole Earth yet?".&lt;ref name=Brand-214&gt;Brand 2009, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; During this campaign, Brand met [[Richard Buckminster Fuller]], who offered to help Brand with his projects.&lt;ref name=Brand-Leonard&gt;{{cite web|author=Leonard, Jennifer|title=Stewart Brand on the long view|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212213039/http://www.renegademedia.info/books/stewart-brand.html|accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, a satellite, [[ATS-3]], took the photo.   Brand thought the image of our planet would be a powerful [[symbol]]. It adorned the first (Fall 1968) edition of the ''Whole Earth Catalog''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wholeearth.com/uploads/2/Image/covers/thumbs-md/md-fall-1968-1010-cover.jpg The front cover of the Fall 1968 edition of the ''Whole Earth Catalog'' showing the AST-3 image of 10 November 1967]&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1968, a NASA [[astronaut]] took an Earth photo,&lt;ref name=Brand-214 /&gt; ''[[Earthrise]]'', from Moon orbit, which became the front image of the spring 1969 edition of the ''Catalog''. 1970 saw the first celebration of [[Earth Day]].&lt;ref name=Brand-Smithsonian /&gt; During a 2003 interview, Brand explained that the image "gave the sense that Earth's an island, surrounded by a lot of inhospitable space. And it's so graphic, this little blue, white, green and brown jewel-like [[icon]] amongst a quite featureless black [[vacuum]]."

==Douglas Engelbart==
In late 1968, Brand assisted electrical engineer [[Douglas Engelbart]] with [[The Mother of All Demos]], a famous presentation of many revolutionary [[computer technology|computer technologies]] (including [[hypertext]], email, and the [[Computer mouse|mouse]]) to the [[Fall Joint Computer Conference]] in San Francisco.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Brand surmised that given the necessary consciousness, information, and tools, human beings could reshape the world they had made (and were making) for themselves into something environmentally and socially [[sustainable]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==''Whole Earth Catalog''==

During the late 1960s and early 1970s about 10&amp;nbsp;million Americans were involved in living [[Commune|communally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Turner, Fred|title=From Counterculture to Cyberculture: The Legacy of the Whole Earth Catalog|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9001613451407405270#|publisher=Stanford University Libraries via Google|time=19:00|accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968, using the most basic approaches to [[typesetting]] and page-layout, Brand and his colleagues created issue number one of ''The [[Whole Earth Catalog]]'', employing the significant subtitle, "access to tools".&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirk, Andrew G.|title=Counterculture Green: The Whole Earth Catalog and American Environmentalism|url=https://www.amazon.com/Counterculture-Green-American-Environmentalism-CultureAmerica/dp/0700615458/|year=2007|work=KSBW|publisher=[[University Press of Kansas]] via Amazon.com|isbn=0-7006-1545-8|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brand and his wife Lois travelled to [[communes]] in a 1963 [[Dodge]] truck known as the ''Whole Earth Truck Store'', which moved to a storefront in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name=Kirk /&gt;  That first oversize ''Catalog'', and its successors in the 1970s and later, reckoned a wide assortment of things could serve as useful "tools": books, maps, garden implements, specialized clothing, [[carpenters]]' and [[Brick mason|masons]]' tools, [[forestry]] gear, tents, [[welding]] equipment, professional journals, early synthesizers, and personal computers. Brand invited "reviews" (written in the form of a letter to a friend) of the best of these items from experts in specific fields. The information also described where these things could be located or purchased. The ''Catalog''{{'}}s publication coincided with the great wave of social and cultural experimentation, convention-breaking, and "[[do it yourself]]" attitude associated with the "[[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]]".

The influence of these ''Whole Earth Catalog''s on the rural [[back-to-the-land movement]] of the 1970s, and the communities movement within many cities, was widespread throughout the United States, Canada, and Australia. A 1972 edition sold 1.5&amp;nbsp;million copies, winning the first U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[National Book Award]] in [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Current|category Contemporary Affairs]].&lt;ref name=nba1972&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1972 "National Book Awards – 1972"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-09. &lt;br/&gt;There was a "Contemporary" or "Current" award category from 1972 to 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''CoEvolution Quarterly''==
To continue this work and also to publish full-length [[Article (publishing)|articles]] on specific topics in the [[natural sciences]] and [[invention]], in numerous areas of the arts and the [[social sciences]], and on the contemporary scene in general, Brand founded the ''[[CoEvolution Quarterly]]'' (CQ) during 1974, aimed primarily at educated [[layperson]]s.  Brand never better revealed his opinions and reason for hope than when he ran, in ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' #4, a transcription of technology historian [[Lewis Mumford]]'s talk "The Next Transformation of Man", in which he stated that "man has still within him sufficient resources to alter the direction of modern civilization, for we then need no longer regard man as the passive victim of his own irreversible technological development."

The content of ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' often included [[futurism]] or risqué topics. Besides giving space to unknown writers with something valuable to say, Brand presented articles by many respected authors and thinkers, including [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Howard T. Odum]], [[Witold Rybczynski]], [[Karl Hess]], [[Orville Schell]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Wendell Berry]], [[Ursula K.&amp;nbsp;Le Guin]], [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Amory Lovins]], [[Hazel Henderson]], [[Gary Snyder]], [[Lynn Margulis]], [[Eric Drexler]], [[Gerard K. O'Neill]], [[Peter Calthorpe]], [[Sim Van der Ryn]], [[Paul Hawken]], [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], and [[Donella Meadows]].  During ensuing years, Brand authored and edited a number of books on topics as diverse as computer-based media, the life history of buildings, and ideas about [[Space colonization|space colonies]].

He founded the ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Review]],'' a supplement to the ''[[Whole Earth Software Catalog and Review|Whole Earth Software Catalog]],'' in 1984. It merged with ''CoEvolution Quarterly'' to form the ''[[Whole Earth Review]]'' in 1985.

==California government==
From 1977 to 1979, Brand served as "special adviser" to the [[Administration (government)|administration]] of California Governor [[Jerry Brown]].

==The WELL==
In 1985, Brand and [[Larry Brilliant]] founded The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]] ("Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link"), a prototypical, wide-ranging [[online community]] for intelligent, informed participants the world over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/62533774|title=From counterculture to cyberculture : Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the rise of digital utopianism|last=Fred.|first=Turner,|date=2006|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=0226817415|location=Chicago|oclc=62533774}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:Well logo.gif|right]] --&gt; The WELL won the 1990 Best Online Publication Award from the [[Computer Press Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Katie Hafner, ''The [[WELL (virtual community)|WELL]]: A Story of Love, Death and Real Life in the Seminal Online Community'':(2001) Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers {{ISBN|0-7867-0846-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost certainly the ideas behind the WELL were greatly inspired by [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s work at [[SRI International]]; Brand was acknowledged by Engelbart in "[[The Mother of All Demos]]" in 1968 when the [[computer mouse]] and [[video conferencing]] were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3JH0ckWju0&amp;feature=related |title=(5:26:00) |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Business Network==
[[File:Stewart Brand-200904.jpg|thumb|Brand listening in [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]], California, in 2009.]]

During 1986, Brand was a visiting scientist at the [[MIT Media Lab]]. Soon after, he became a private-conference organizer for such corporations as [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch/Shell]], [[Volvo]], and [[AT&amp;T Corporation]]. In 1988, he became a co‑founder of the [[Global Business Network]], which explores global futures and business strategies informed by the sorts of values and information which Brand has always found vital. The GBN has become involved with the evolution and application of [[scenario thinking]], planning, and complementary strategic tools. In other connections, Brand has been part of the board of the [[Santa Fe Institute]] (founded in 1984), an organization devoted to "fostering a [[multidisciplinary]] scientific research community pursuing frontier science". He has also continued to promote the preservation of tracts of [[wilderness]].

==''Whole Earth Discipline''==
The ''Whole Earth Catalog'' implied an ideal of human [[progress (history)|progress]] that depended on decentralized, personal, and liberating technological development—so‑called "soft technology". However, during 2005 he criticized aspects of the international [[Natural environment|environmental]] ideology he had helped to develop. He wrote an article called "Environmental Heresies"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/404000/environmental-heresies/|title=Environmental Heresies|work=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the May 2005 issue of the [[MIT]] ''[[Technology Review]]'', in which he describes what he considers necessary changes to environmentalism. He suggested among other things that environmentalists embrace [[nuclear power]] and [[genetically modified organisms]] as technologies with more promise than risk.

Brand later developed these ideas into a book and published the ''[[Whole Earth Discipline]]: An Ecopragmatist [[Manifesto]]'' in 2009. The book examines how urbanization, nuclear power, [[genetic engineering]], [[climate engineering|geoengineering]], and [[wildlife]] restoration can be used as powerful tools in humanity's ongoing fight against [[global warming]].&lt;ref name="whole-earth-discipline"&gt;{{cite book|title=Whole Earth Discipline: An Ecopragmatist Manifesto|author=Stewart Brand|publisher=Viking|year=2009|isbn=978-0-670-02121-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Long Now Foundation==
Brand is co‑chair and President of the Board of Directors of [[The Long Now Foundation]].  Brand chairs the foundation's [[Seminars About Long-term Thinking]] (SALT).  This series on long-term thinking has presented a large range of different speakers including: [[Brian Eno]], [[Neal Stephenson]], [[Vernor Vinge]], [[Philip Rosedale]], [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]], [[Clay Shirky]], [[Ray Kurzweil]], [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Cory Doctorow]], and many others.

'''''The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism''''' is a book on [[political theory]] written by Danish sociologist [[Gøsta Esping-Andersen]], published in 1990. The work is Esping-Andersen's most influential and highly cited work, outlining three main types of [[welfare state]]s, in which modern developed capitalist nations cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Esping-Andersen | first = Gøsta | title = The three worlds of welfare capitalism | publisher = Princeton University Press | location = Princeton, New Jersey | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780069028573 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Esping-Andersen | first = Gøsta | title = The three political economies of the welfare state | journal = [[International Journal of Sociology]] | volume = 20 | issue = 3 | pages = 92–123 | publisher = M.E.

Allan. "Social stratification and welfare regimes for the twenty-first Century: Revisiting the three worlds of welfare capitalism." World Politics 60, no. 04 (2008): 642-664.&lt;/ref&gt; The work called into question well-established ways of thinking about differences among welfare states in advanced capitalist democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Ragin, Charles. "A qualitative comparative analysis of pension systems." The comparative political economy of the welfare state (1994): 320-45.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of writing this book, Gøsta Esping-Andersen was Professor at the European University Institute, Florence.

==Typology of welfare capitalism==
In ''The Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism'', Esping-Andersen outlines a typology of welfare capitalism in an attempt to classify contemporary Western welfare states as belonging to one of three "worlds of welfare capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;Svallfors, Stefan. "Worlds of welfare and attitudes to redistribution: A comparison of eight western nations." European Sociological Review 13, no. 3 (1997): 283-304.&lt;/ref&gt; The three types are characterised by a specific labour market regime and also by a specific post‐industrial employment trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Kloosterman, Robert C. "Three Worlds of Welfare Capitalism? The welfare state and the post‐industrial trajectory in the Netherlands after 1980." West European Politics 17, no. 4 (1994): 166-189.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types are:
* Liberal regimes, characterized by modest, [[Means-tested benefit|means-tested assistance]], and targeted at low-income, usually working-class recipients. Their strict entitlement rules are often associated with stigma. This type of welfare state encourages [[Social enterprise|market solutions to social problems]] — either passively, by guaranteeing only a minimum, or actively, by [[Public/social/private partnership|directly subsidizing]] private welfare schemes.
* Conservative regimes, which are typically shaped by [[Family values|traditional family values]], and tend to encourage family-based assistance dynamics. Social insurance in this model typically excludes non-working wives, and family benefits encourage motherhood. State assistance will typically only step in when the family's capacity to aid its members is exhausted.
* Social democratic regimes, universalistic systems that promote an equality of high standards, rather than an equality of minimal needs. This implies [[Decommodification|decommodifying]] welfare services, to reduce the division introduced by market-based access to welfare services, as well as preemptively socializing the costs of caring for children, the aged, and the helpless, instead of then waiting until the family's capacity to support them is depleted. This results in a commitment to a heavy social service burden, which introduces an imperative to minimize social problems, thereby aligning the system's goals with the welfare and emancipation (typically via [[full employment]] policies) of those it supports.

Since its publication the typology has been widely used in academic research and theory,&lt;ref&gt;Bambra, Clare. "Going beyond The three worlds of welfare capitalism: regime theory and public health research." Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health 61, no. 12 (2007): 1098-1102.&lt;/ref&gt; and has generated much debate on the subject of the nature of the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Bambra, Clare. "The worlds of welfare: illusory and gender blind?." Social Policy and Society 3, no. 03 (2004): 201-211.&lt;/ref&gt; The desirability of the work's approach has been stated by various comparative welfare state scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Allan, James P., and Lyle Scruggs. "Political partisanship and welfare state reform in advanced industrial societies." American Journal of Political Science 48, no. 3 (2004): 496-512.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book Esping-Andersen criticized earlier theoretical models of the welfare state as "inadequate", arguing that their analysis relied too heavily upon the misleading comparison of aggregate welfare state expenditure,&lt;ref&gt;Bambra, Clare. "Worlds of welfare and the health care discrepancy." Social Policy and Society 4, no. 01 (2005): 31-41.&lt;/ref&gt; and also argued that public expenditure should no longer be a measure of comparison and that we should seek to replace it with other measures.&lt;ref&gt;Castles, Francis G. "Is expenditure enough? On the nature of the dependent variable in comparative public policy analysis." Journal of Commonwealth &amp; Comparative Politics 32, no. 3 (1994): 349-363.&lt;/ref&gt; in the place of expenditure, Esping-Andersen built his typology on a rich database of detailed programme characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Castles, Francis G. "Developing new measures of welfare state change and reform." European Journal of Political Research 41, no. 5 (2002): 613-641.&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Asia===
While using three categories in his typology, the author notes that East Asia may not strictly fit in a single category but may be seen as a hybrid of liberal and conservative models.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Yih‐Jiunn, and Yeun‐wen Ku. "East Asian welfare regimes: testing the hypothesis of the developmental welfare state." Social Policy &amp; Administration 41, no. 2 (2007): 197-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thích Quảng Độ''' (born 27 November 1928) is a Vietnamese [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] and patriarch of the [[Unified Buddhist Sangha of Vietnam]], a currently banned religious body in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfa.org/english/news/vietnam/burn-02172012185416.html Self-Immolation 'Only Possible Recourse'], RFA, 2012-02-17&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, he was awarded the [[Homo Homini Award]] for human rights activism by the Czech group [[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People In Need]], which he shared with [[Thích Huyền Quang]] and [[Thadeus Nguyễn Văn Lý]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|title=Previous Recipients of the Homo Homini Award|publisher=[[People In Need (Czech Republic)|People In Need]]|accessdate=17 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501192644/http://www.clovekvtisni.cz/index2en.php?id=549|archivedate=1 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Thích Quảng Độ was born in the [[Thái Bình Province]] of North Vietnam, at 14 he became a monk. At age 17 he witnessed his religious master executed by the revolutionary People's Tribunal.

===Political opposition===
While a member of the leadership of the UBCV, Thích Quảng Độ became an activist, fighting against the anti-Buddhist policies of [[Ngô Đình Diệm]].  After a police raid of Buddhist monasteries in Hue and Saigon, Quảng Độ was arrested on  August 20, 1963. He and thousands of other Buddhists endured torture and persecution while imprisoned by the Diem government. As a result of imprisonment, Độ struggled with [[tuberculosis]] before having a lung operation.

In 1975 Vietnam was under communist control, and the UBCV was once again unwelcome in Vietnam. As a result, the UBCV facilities were seized, and documents burned. Quảng Độ was active in protesting the governments actions, and after attempting to gather Buddhists from other regions in non-violent opposition, he was arrested on charges of anti-revolutionary activities and undermining national solidarity. He spent  20 months at the Phan Dang Luu Prison in solitary confinement, before he was trialed and released in December, 1978. Later that year  he was nominated by Betty Williams and [[Mairead Maguire]] to receive the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name="Que me"&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile on Most Venerable Thich Quang Do, Head of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam|url=http://www.queme.net/eng/thichquangdo.php|work=Biography|publisher=Que me|accessdate=24 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125093252/http://queme.net/eng/thichquangdo.php|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 the Vietnamese Government created a Buddhist alternative, called the Vietnam Buddhist Church, which was state sponsored and controlled by the [[Vietnam Fatherland Front]].  Because of Quảng Độ's opposition to the new church, he was again jailed. Quảng Độ would spend the next 10 years in exile in the village of Vu Doai.&lt;ref name="Que me" /&gt;

Yet again in 1995, while attempting to expose government abuse of the UBCV, he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.

Thích Quảng Độ became the President of the UBCV's Institute for the Dissemination of the Dharma in 1999, meaning that he was the second-ranking UBCV dignitary after patriarch Thich Huyen Quang. In 2008, as one of his last wishes Patriarch Quang named Thích Quảng Độ as the new patriarch of the  Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Que me" /&gt;

==Awards==
In 2001, Thích Quảng Độ received the Hellman-Hammet Award for persecuted writers.

In 2002, Thích Quảng Độ, together with Father Nguyễn Văn Lý, received Vietnam Human Rights Award from Vietnam Human Rights Network.

In 2003, Thích Quảng Độ was honored with the [[Homo Homini Award]] for human rights activism by the Czech group People in Need, which he shared with Thích Huyền Quảng and Father Nguyễn Văn Lý.&lt;ref&gt; Martin Hrobský (11-04-2003). [https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/homo-homini-awards-recognize-the-work-of-three-vietnamese-activists Homo Homini Awards recognize the work of three Vietnamese activists], Czech Radio&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was awarded the [[Thorolf Rafto Memorial Prize]], in recognition of "personal courage and perseverance through three decades of peaceful opposition against the communist regime in Vietnam, and as a symbol for the growing democracy movement". Thích Quảng Độ was unable to the receive the award, as the government prevented him from attending the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;The Rafto Foundation, [https://www.rafto.no/the-rafto-prize/thich-quang-do 2006 Laureate Thích Quảng Độ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Thích Quảng Độ was also awarded the Democracy Courage Tribute by the World Movement for Democracy.

In January 2008, the Europe-based magazine ''[[A Different View]]'' chose Độ as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy. Others in the list include [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Lech Wałęsa]], [[Corazon Aquino]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

{{Politics of Burundi}}

The position of '''Vice-President of the Republic of [[Burundi]]''' was created in June 1998, when a transitional constitution went into effect. It replaced the post of [[List of heads of government of Burundi|Prime Minister]].

== History of the office ==

=== Interim Period (1998–2001) ===
[[Pierre Buyoya]], a former [[List of Presidents of Burundi|President]] (1987–1993) who seized power in a [[1996 Burundian coup d'état|1996 military coup]], was sworn in as President of the Republic on 11 June 1998. He appointed [[Frédéric Bamvuginyumvira]], a [[Hutu]] member of the [[Front for Democracy in Burundi]] (FRODEBU), as 1st vice-president. [[Mathias Sinamenye]], a [[Tutsi]] member of Buyoya's [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA) party, was appointed 2nd vice-president.

According to the transitional constitution, the vice-presidency consisted of two posts: The 1st vice-president (Responsible for political and administrative affairs) and the 2nd vice-president (Responsible for economic and social affairs).

=== Transitional Period (2001–2005) ===
A new transitional power-sharing government took office on 1 November 2001. Interim president Pierre Buyoya became transitional president for a period of 18 months. At the end of his term in 2003, Hutu Vice-President [[Domitien Ndayizeye]] took office and appointed a Tutsi ([[Alphonse-Marie Kadege]]) as vice-president. In November 2004, Kadege was sacked as vice-president and replaced by [[Frédéric Ngenzebuhoro]]. Although Ndayizeye's term was due to end in late 2004 following elections, the transitional period was extended and planned elections were delayed. [[Burundi elections, 2005 (disambiguation)|Elections]] were held in mid-2005 and the transitional period is due to end on 26 August 2005, when the newly elected president takes office.

=== Vice-Presidency 2005-2018 ===
Burundi's new constitution, approved in a 28 February 2005 [[Burundian constitutional referendum, 2005|constitutional referendum]], calls for a two-member vice-presidency (similar to that of the interim period). The 1st vice-president will be responsible for political and administrative affairs, while the 2nd vice-president will handle social and economic affairs. One vice-president will be an ethnic Hutu and the other a Tutsi. Nominees must be approved by both chambers of [[Parliament of Burundi|parliament]] in order to take office.

On 29 August 2005, President [[Pierre Nkurunziza]] nominated [[Martin Nduwimana]] and [[Alice Nzomukunda]] for the posts of 1st and 2nd vice-president. Both received approval from parliament and were immediately sworn in.

A '''write out''' is a [[punishment]] used in [[school]]s in which a misbehaving [[student]] must write something out. It is different from writing lines as, instead of writing something out a number of times, the student might write out a [[page (paper)|page]], [[chapter (books)|chapter]] or [[paragraph]] of their schoolbook, workbook or [[novel]]. In the case of non-written homework ([[spelling]]s), the student might have to write the spellings a number of times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/writeout.asp|title=Write Out|last=Staff|first=Investopedia|date=2006-11-09|work=Investopedia|access-date=2018-08-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
