'''"100% d'amour"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "100% of love") was the [[Luxembourg]]ish entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1984]], performed in [[French language|French]] by 19-year-old musical newcomer [[Sophie Carle]]. Despite Luxembourg's storied history in the Contest, which included five wins at that point, Carle was only the fourth singer to represent Luxembourg who was native to the Grand Duchy, the three previous being [[Solange Berry]] in 1958, [[Camillo Felgen]] in 1960 and 1962 and [[Monique Melsen]] in 1971.

The song is a ballad, with Carle asking to be given "100% of love" to maintain her sanity in the modern world. During the live performance, Carle allegedly had trouble keeping her own harmony over her loud [[electric keyboard|keyboard]] and [[drum machine]] accompaniments, which led to a largely off-key performance.

The song was performed second on the night (following [[Sweden]]'s [[Herreys]] with "[[Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley]]" and preceding [[France]]'s [[Annick Thoumazeau]] with "[[Autant d'amoureux que d'étoiles]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 39 points, placing 10th in a field of 19.

The relatively unsuccessful representation by Carle on home turf caused her to place her singing career on permanent hiatus. Instead, Carle pursued an acting career, in which she is still active as of 2008.

It was succeeded as [[Luxembourg in the Eurovision Song Contest|Luxembourgish representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985|1985 Contest]] by [[Annemieke Verdoorn|Margo]], [[Claude Vangansbeck|Franck Oliver]], [[Diane Solomon]], [[Ireen Sheer]], [[Malcolm Roberts (singer)|Malcolm]] and [[Chris Roberts (singer)|Chris Roberts]] with "[[Children, Kinder, Enfants]]".

'''Andorra''' chose their entry for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]] using an internal selection called ''Projecte Eurovisió''. Radio i Televisió d'Andorra (RTVA) confirmed that the Andorran representative at the 2007 Eurovision Song Contest was the young punk-rock band [[Anonymous (band)|Anonymous]] with their song "[[Salvem el món]]" (Save The World). Anonymous beat off competition from over eighty other candidates, and were unanimously selected by a 10-member jury.

The song was premiered on March 1 on a special gala broadcast by Andorra Televisió from the Auditori Claror del Centre Cultural i de Congressos Lauredià in the town of Sant Julia de Loria.

Anonymous took part in the semi-final of Eurovision on May 10. They performed in the 21st spot. Despite being one of the favorites, they just missed the final with a 12th position. It is suggested they failed because of political voting, as only songs from [[Eastern Europe]] progressed to the final. It led to rumours of an Andorran withdrawal in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]].

This entry was the first from Andorra to contain lyrics in English.

The '''Antarctic Treaty Secretariat (ATS)''' is an organization created in 2003 by the [[Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting]] (ATCM) for the management of several ATCM tasks such as the support of the annual meeting of signatory countries of the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], and the publication of the ATCM annual report. 
The Secretariat was created through Measure 1 (2003), adopted by the XXVI Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting held in Madrid (Spain). Apart from establishing the Secretariat,  Measure 1 (2003) also sets up the Secretariat's functions and budget.

Other activities carried out by the Secretariat include the support between sessions for the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP), improving the communication between signatories of the treaty, as well as recompilation, storage and distribution of information, such as the ATCM and CEP records.

The organization's first Executive Secretary was Mr. Jan Huber, from the Netherlands. Mr. Huber occupied this position for 5 years until 31 August 2009. He was succeeded on 1 September 2009 by Mr. Manfred Reinke (Germany) who was elected in April 2009 by the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in Baltimore (US).

The Secretariat Headquarters are established in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

The Antarctic Treaty operated without any permanent institution until 1 September 2004, when the Antarctic Treaty Secretariat started operations in Buenos Aires. Under direction of the Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting, the Secretariat works to:
* Prepare and support the ATCM and other meetings
* Collect, maintain and publish the records of the ATCM
* Facilitate the exchange of information between the Parties required under the Treaty and the Protocol
* Provide information about the Antarctic Treaty system to the public

The '''Apostolic Vicariate of Savannakhet''' ({{lang-la|Vicariatus Apostolicus Savannakhetensis}}) is a territorial jurisdiction of the [[Catholic Church in Laos]]. As an [[apostolic vicariate]], it is a pre-diocesan jurisdiction, entitled to a [[titular bishop]]. It is located in central [[Laos]].

It is exempt, i.e., not part of any [[ecclesiastical province]] and directly dependent on the [[Holy See]] and its missionary [[Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]].

The vicariate covers an area of 48,100&amp;nbsp;km² in central Laos, including the provinces of [[Savannakhet (province)|Savannakhet]], [[Khammouan]] and part of [[Bolikhamxai]]. By land area, it is the largest of the apostolic vicariates in Laos. Approximately 12,500 of the 2.7 million people living within the vicariate are members of the Catholic Church. The vicariate has 54 [[parish]]es, and only 6 priests.

==History==
The Apostolic Vicariate of Savannakhet was originally established as the [[Prefecture Apostolic]] of Thakhek on 21 December 1950, when the [[Vicariate Apostolic of Laos]] was split into two parts. The western part in Thailand was renamed the [[Vicariate Apostolic of Thare]], while the Laotian part was formed into a new prefecture. On 24 February 1958 it was elevated to an [[Apostolic Vicariate]]. In 1963 the name was changed to Savannakhet, even though its see remained in [[Thakhek]], Khammouan province. In 1967 the southern part of the vicariate was erected as the independent [[Vicariate Apostolic of Paksé]].

== Controversies ==
Berau Coal was once part of the assets of Asia Resource Minerals, the renamed Bumi Plc, which Vallar, British financier Nat Rothschild’s £700m cash shell, bought a stake in in July 2010.

After a series of internal disputes, board room battles and court inquiries into “financial irregularities” at Berau Coal, Amir Sambodo agreed to resign in March 2015 as president director of Berau. However, he failed to relinquish the position and refused to allow Asia Resource’s chief financial officer, chief mining officer or his successor into the head office of Berau. For a while, Bumi executives acting on behalf of Rothschild only had limited access to Berau’s accounting systems and bank account information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/industry/mining/11622948/Company-suspends-shares-trading-after-former-CEO-refuses-to-leave-head-office.html|title=Company suspends shares trading after former CEO refuses to leave head office|last=|first=|date=22 May 2015|website=The Telegraph|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, Asia Resource Minerals accused Another former president director of Berau Coal, Rosan Roeslani, of embezzlement. During the preparation of Berau's annual results for the year ended Dec. 31, 2012, unexplained payments totalling $201 million were found to have been made in 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/With-founder-on-hook-for-173M-private-equity-company-plans-media-asset-sale|title=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/With-founder-on-hook-for-173M-private-equity-company-plans-media-asset-sale|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, Roeslani was ordered to hand over $173 million plus associated costs by a court in Singapore.

The Widjaja’s Sinar Mas subsidiary company, Asia Coal Energy Ventures, spearheaded by the 33 year old Fuganto Widjaja, together with Argyle Street Management Ltd., countered on May 7 2015 with a cash offer and alternative recapitalization plan involving a $150 million cash injection and a restructuring support agreement similar to the one offered by Rothschild in May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nat-rothschild-agrees-to-sell-arms-stake-1433776140|title=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nat-rothschild-agrees-to-sell-arms-stake-1433776140|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response Rothschild gave up his long battle for ARM and agreed to sell his 17.2% stake in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/nat-rothschild-agrees-to-sell-arms-stake-1433776140|title=Nat Rothschild Agrees to Sell ARMS Stake|last=|first=|date=8 June 2015|website=The Wall Street Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rothschild’s holding company later commented on the affair that “This will be our first and last investment in Indonesia’s coal sector” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1def1222-0dde-11e5-9a65-00144feabdc0|title=https://www.ft.com/content/1def1222-0dde-11e5-9a65-00144feabdc0|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berau Capital Resources Pte issued US$450 million worth of 12.5% guaranteed senior secured notes, in 2015.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2297">'''Borankana'''{{Pronunciation-needed}} refers to a traditional music in [[Botswana]] which is usually practiced or performed by [[Bakwena]] tribe in the [[Kweneng District]] of Botswana ([[Molepolole]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Borankana dance|url=http://www.knowbotswana.com/botswana-dance.html|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borankana is strongly connected to the [[culture of Botswana]].The other used name for Borankana is Phathisi. Borankana is traditionally performed by both elderly people and young people.According to history, Borankana was performed during tribal activities only.  It is believed according to history that only man and boys were the ones dancing whilst the females sang, clapped hands and [[Ululate]]d during performances.&lt;ref name="phibion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phibion|first1=Otukile Sindiso|title=Borankana (Phathisi) Music Performance, Learning and Transmission among the Bakwena of  Botswana|journal=International Journal of Scientific Research in Education|date=March 2012|volume=5|issue=1|pages=12-17|url=http://www.ijsre.com/assets/vol.,-5_1_-phibion.pdf|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Origins of Phathisi/ Borankana ==
Borankana performances are estimated to have initiated by the year 1914 and 1916.According to history Phathisi came from a man tying down the lowest part of his trouser using a peg when he cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Music performances in Botswana music|url=https://books.google.co.bw/books?id=AvUpEsik5W4C&amp;pg=PT258&amp;lpg=PT258&amp;dq=borankana&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yboplZmuwp&amp;sig=q0eVqT5UKByv7_noqWpXo35PnX0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUtNmgtLbWAhWQOsAKHdJPCHo4ChDoAQg0MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=borankana&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, man used to work in mines using their bicycles and for one man to own a bicycle they have to be wealthy enough to be able to purchase one, and the trouser had to be tied hard to avoid toppling of the rider or the trouser being hooked by the chain.The same process of trouser pegging was used when performing Borankana.It was changed from pegging the lower part of the trouser to using shorts when performing the Borankana.&lt;ref name=phibion /&gt;

'''Deutsches Theater''' was a German-language theater in [[Oslo]], Norway which existed between 1941 and 1944, during the [[German occupation of Norway]].

It was established on 1 January 1941 following an order from [[Josef Terboven]], and the first performance was held on 22 April 1941 in [[Nationaltheatret]]. It later moved to new localities, in Stortingsgata 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oslopuls.no/hvaskjer/index.jsp?placeId=1018 |title=Filmteateret (a later tenant of  Stortingsgata 16) |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=Oslopuls |publisher=''[[Aftenposten]]'' |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[premiere]] performance, the operetta ''[[The Land of Smiles]]'' by [[Franz Lehár]], was held on 7 June the same year. The theatre closed in September 1944 because the resources needed to be channeled elsewhere in the German war machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= |first= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |editor=Dahl, Hans Fredrik |encyclopedia=[[Norsk krigsleksikon 1940-45]] |title=Deutsches Theater |url=http://mediabase1.uib.no/krigslex/d/d3.html#deutsches-theater |accessdate=2008-07-16 |edition= |date= |year=1995 |month= |publisher=Cappelen |volume= |location=Oslo |id= |isbn=82-02-14138-9 |doi= |pages= |quote= |editor-link= Hans Fredrik Dahl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dinotopia LAFT cover.jpg|thumbnail|300px|''Dinotopia: A Land Apart From Time'' by [[James Gurney]]]]

'''''Dinotopia''''' is a fictional [[utopia]] created by author and illustrator [[James Gurney]]. It is the setting for the book series with which it shares its name. Dinotopia is an isolated island inhabited by shipwrecked humans and [[Sapience|sapient]] [[dinosaur]]s who have learned to coexist peacefully as a single [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] society. The first book was published in 1992 and has "appeared in 18 languages in more than 30 countries and sold two million copies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrm.org/page276 |title=Illustrator Biographies |accessdate=14 October 2008 |publisher=Norman Rockwell Museum |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828055708/http://www.nrm.org./page276 |archivedate=28 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time'' and ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath'' both won [[Hugo award]]s for best original artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=27 |title=The Hugo Awards: 1993 Hugo Awards |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=World Science Fiction Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/?page_id=24 |title=The Hugo Awards: 1996 Hugo Awards |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=World Science Fiction Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its original publication, over twenty Dinotopia books have been published by various authors to expand the series. A live-action TV mini-series, a brief live-action TV series, an animated film, and several video games have also been released.

==Background==
Gurney's assignments for ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' required him to work with archaeologists to envision and paint ancient cities that no one alive today has ever seen. This inspired him to imagine his own, so he painted "Waterfall City"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinotopia.com/art_waterfall_city.html Waterfall City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325193513/http://www.dinotopia.com/art_waterfall_city.html |date=25 March 2010 }}, dinotopia.com. Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and "Dinosaur parade".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dinotopia.com/art_dinosaur_parade.html Dinosaur Parade] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325193504/http://www.dinotopia.com/art_dinosaur_parade.html |date=25 March 2010 }}, dinotopia.com. Retrieved August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; These were originally done as art prints for collectors.&lt;ref name=TimeforKids/&gt; He later decided to create an imaginary island based on these paintings.&lt;ref name=TimeforKids&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kids/news/story/0,28277,1675219,00.html |title=A Talk with James Gurney |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Maltby |first=Anna |date=24 October 2007 |work=Time for Kids |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208150140/http://www.timeforkids.com/TFK/kids/news/story/0,28277,1675219,00.html |archivedate=8 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than digital tools, Gurney used "[[plein-air]] studies, thumbnail sketches, models photographed in costume and original cardboard or clay [[maquette]]s"&lt;ref name=Murray/&gt; to create 150 oil paintings for his 2007 Dinotopia book.&lt;ref name=Murray&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/pop/articles/1129dinotopia1129.html?&amp;wired |title=Incredible journey: New book goes back to 'Dinotopia' |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Murray |first=Kathleen Wereszynski |date=29 November 2007 |work=The Arizona Republic }}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the series "Dinotopia": a [[portmanteau]] of "dinosaur" and "utopia".&lt;ref name=TimeforKids/&gt;

Many have claimed that some scenes in the film ''[[Star Wars: Episode I&amp;nbsp;– The Phantom Menace]]'' (particularly those in the city of [[Theed]] on [[Naboo]]) unfairly copy images from Gurney's books.&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt; Gurney acknowledges the resemblance but has remained positive about it.&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt; In 1994, director [[George Lucas]] had met with producers to discuss some of the concepts and visuals behind a ''Dinotopia'' movie that was never made.&lt;ref name=Echo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.echostation.com/interview/gurney.htm |title="Breathe Deep, Seek Peace": Controversial Similarities Between "Dinotopia" and "The Phantom Menace", Including Discussion with the Author, James Gurney |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Phillips |first=Loren |date=6 June 1999 |publisher=Echo Station |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927215721/http://www.echostation.com/interview/gurney.htm |archivedate=27 September 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The island==
Upon the hidden island of Dinotopia, humans and dinosaurs live and work together in harmony with one another and with the Earth itself. It is a place of beauty and wonder lost to the rest of the world. The island is surrounded by a storm system and dangerous reefs that prevent safe travel to or from the island. Aside from a highly diverse ecosystem ranging from deserts to mountains to swamps, Dinotopia also has an extensive system of natural and man-made caves.

The dinosaurs, according to their own legends, have inhabited the island for millions of years, having sought shelter in the underground caverns during the climate changes that caused the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction of dinosaurs]] elsewhere on the planet.

The caverns are referred to as the World Beneath, and many dinosaurs go there to die. According to legends, a half-man-half [[ceratopsian]] being named Ogthar climbed down there (where the sun is said to sleep at night) and stole pieces of it (known as "sunstones"), using them to create the empire of Poseidos and populating it with metal dinosaurs. However, the sea grew angry with the artificial city and rose to destroy it. It is implied that this is where the Atlantis myth originated.

[[File:Dinotopian script.svg|thumb|Dinotopia written in the [[Latin alphabet|Roman]] and Dinotopian scripts.]]
The human population consists of shipwrecked travelers called ''Dolphinbacks'' (who are often rescued and brought to shore by ''[[Kentriodon]]'') and the descendants of such arrivals. As such, they often fall into cultural zones based on the societies from whence their ancestors came, creating a cultural landscape across the island that is both unified and incredibly diverse.

Dinosaurs are not the only prehistoric creatures on the island. In the higher regions of the Forbidden Mountains (a Himalaya-like mountain chain), [[woolly mammoth]]s, [[ground sloth]]s, [[chalicothere]]s, [[saber-toothed cat]]s, and other prehistoric mammals can be found. Basal [[synapsid]]s are present as well; at least one ''[[Lystrosaurus]]'' and one ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'' can be found in the city of Pooktook.

[[Pterosaur]]s are also common, especially the ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]] [[skybax]]'', which serve as steeds for the skybax messenger riders.

The seas surrounding the island are completely inhabited by prehistoric life such as [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]] and [[trilobite]]s, as well as an unknown species of dolphin.

The center of the island is made up of a dense rainforest called the "Rainy Basin". This place is where most of the island's large carnivores live, such as ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', and ''[[Allosaurus]]''. They are just as sentient as the other dinosaurs on the island but must be kept apart due to their instinctual need to hunt. They have their own language yet it is very deep and guttural and difficult even for other dinosaurs to speak or understand fluently. The Basin is cut off from the rest of the island by a series of retractable bridges. There are caravans that make passages through the basin and are made up by very large sauropod dinosaurs outfitted with heavy suits of armor studded with sharp spikes and carry offerings of meat to appease any carnivores they meet. Often, a dinosaur that senses it will die soon will make a pilgrimage to the basin and die there so that it may be eaten by the carnivores and continue to contribute to the good of the island as a whole. The carnivores are actually very respectful of this and always wait for the dinosaur to pass peacefully, never attacking them while alive. The basin is divided by packs of predators, one ruled by Giganotosaurs, the other ruled by Tyrannosaurs.

The Great Desert is a desert in the east that stretches from Chandara to Pteros. The gorges of the Amu River is where Canyon City is built.

The northern part of Dinotopia has the Backbone Mountains which runs across the eastern and western parts of Dinotopia where it forms the northern border of the Rainy Basin and ending at Crackshell Point. Many large mammalian species reside here. In addition, there is the Northern Plains at its northern coast.

The southern part of Dinotopia has Blackwood Flats, a lowland area where its visitors are targets of biting insects, poisonous snakes, a tiger-striped Allosaurus, and a red-faced Tyrannosaurus.

Both the eastern and western halves of the dinotopian society share responsibility equally and live under a common set of laws known as the [[#Code of Dinotopia|Code of Dinotopia]]. The society is highly communal, lacking a monetary system or even a concrete concept of ownership. Individuals are educated from youth to be compassionate, co-operative, and generally conscious of others' needs. For example, food on the island is provided at no cost, but citizens take only what they need and leave the rest for others. Stealing or other crime is virtually non-existent.

==Series overview==
''Dinotopia'' began as an illustrated children's book called ''Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time''. It was a cross-over success, appealing to both children and adult readers, which led James Gurney to write and illustrate three more books called ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath,'' ''Dinotopia: First Flight'' and ''Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara''. They all deal with the adventures of Arthur and Will Denison to one degree or another. These are considered the main books of the series and establish the fictional world in which the others are set. Gurney keeps abreast with recent paleontological discoveries and has written then-newly discovered dinosaurs into his books, for example, including ''Giganotosaurus'' in ''The World Beneath'' and ''Microraptor'' in ''Journey to Chandara''

A children's flip-up version of the first book was also issued.

The ''Dinotopia Digest'' series consists of sixteen young adult novels penned by several different authors. These books feature other characters who are not specifically involved with the events of the main books, although characters from the main books (particularly the Denisons) have appeared in minor or cameo roles.

Two full-length adult fantasy novels were also issued with Gurney's authority, written by [[Alan Dean Foster]]: ''Dinotopia Lost'' and ''The Hand of Dinotopia''.

Several video games, as well as a TV mini-series, a short-lived TV series, and an animated children's movie, were also produced. These are also set in the ''Dinotopia'' universe, but do not tie in directly with the main series. Most of them take place in the modern world, unlike the books, which are mostly set in the mid-19th century.

==Main books==
The plot of the main ''Dinotopia'' books concerns Arthur Denison and his son, Will, and the various people they meet in their travels in Dinotopia. In the fashion of authors such as [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], the first and fourth books are written as if they were Arthur's [[diary|journal]]s, with Gurney going so far as to explain in the introductions how he happened to come across the old, waterlogged volumes.

===''A Land Apart from Time''===
In ''Dinotopia: A Land Apart from Time'' (1992),&lt;ref name=Dinotopia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dinotopia.com/index.html |title=Dinotopia |publisher=Dinotopia |accessdate=8 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807202738/http://www.dinotopia.com/index.html |archivedate=7 August 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Denisons are shipwrecked near Dinotopia and, after making it ashore, are found by the people of the Hatchery. The [[Hatchery]] is a place where dinosaurs are born, tended by both dinosaurs and humans. The Denisons then set out to explore the island, hoping to find a means of returning to their old lives.

Arthur and Will undergo a broad journey, circling the island, as they endeavor to learn the customs and culture of their new neighbors. Arthur in particular develops an interest in the scientific accomplishments of the natives, which far exceed that of any human culture. Among the subjects he studies are the flora of the island, the partnership of its inhabitants, and the [[existence]] of a place known as the World Beneath. This World Beneath is an explanation for Dinotopians surviving the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|saurian extinction]]; according to the story, most of the Earth's dinosaurs were destroyed, whilst a few hid in vast underground caverns. These few became the original Dinotopians. No one has entered the World Beneath for centuries, but Arthur intends to do so.

His son Will, on the other hand, has chosen to train as a messenger of the sky; a Skybax rider, who lives in [[symbiosis]] with his mount, the great ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' (nicknamed [[Skybax]]), a species of [[pterosaur]]. Training alongside Will is a girl called Sylvia, with whom Will falls in love. The natives refer to this and any other profound bond as ''Cumspiritik'', which literally means "together-breathing." (Romana Denison of the later Dinotopia film series is said to be Will's daughter.)

Arthur, for his part, travels into the World Beneath, at the same time that Will and Sylvia are learning to fly with the Skybax. When he returns, he is fascinated by the ancient relics found there and is convinced that they may be key in enabling him to leave or explore the island.

Meanwhile, Will and Sylvia learn and master Skybax flight. When at last they have been accepted as Riders, they travel to meet Arthur and his ''[[Protoceratops]]'' guide Bix, but are distracted on the way by a thunderstorm. Luckily, they survive and arrive on time to meet their kin. Will is at the time too young to marry Sylvia, but it is promised that they will. Arthur recognizes that his son has grown up, and they each accept the changes that are results of their new lives on the island.

===''The World Beneath''===
[[File:Dinotopia-twb.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath''.]]
The first sequel, ''Dinotopia: The World Beneath'' (1995) focuses mainly on Arthur Denison's return expedition to the World Beneath and opens with Will fly testing an invention of his father, the Dragoncopter – a [[steam engine]] [[ornithopter]] modeled on the [[dragonfly]]. The Dragoncopter fails and Will is narrowly saved by Cirrus, his Skybax mount, before the Dragoncopter plummets into a waterfall.

After returning from his first expedition in ''A Land Apart From Time'', Arthur presents two items he discovered – a sunstone and half of a key – to the council at Waterfall City in an attempt to get a second expedition into the World Beneath.

A musician named Oriana Nascava comes forward with the missing half of Arthur's key, claiming it to be a family heirloom. She is only willing to give it up if she is allowed to accompany Arthur in his expedition, a term that he reluctantly accepts. Together with Bix as a guide and the scandalous Lee Crabb, the group travels to the shady Pliosaur Canal where they board a [[submersible]] in order to take an underwater route to the World Beneath.

Meanwhile, Will and Sylvia have been assigned to accompany a [[sauropod]] [[caravan (travellers)|caravan]] through the Rainy Basin and keep a watch for predatory ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. However, Cirrus flies Will to ancient ruins in the jungle of which the ''Tyrannosaurus'' are strangely protective.

Arthur, Oriana, Bix, and Lee continue to explore the caverns underneath Dinotopia where they come across instantly [[germination|germinating]] [[fern]] [[spore]]s, uncut sunstones that appear to store ancestral memory, and mechanical limbs that twitch when the sunstone is brought near. Eventually, they reach an enormous man-made chamber filled with abandoned [[Mecha|walking vehicles]] modelled after prehistoric animals, left behind by the ancient civilization of Poseidos, which they nickname "Strutters". Arthur, Oriana, and Bix commandeer a [[ceratopsian]] strutter while Crabb takes a strutter modeled after a [[eurypterid|sea scorpion]] and they both climb out of the World Beneath, ending up in the Rainy Basin. They join the sauropod convoy, but are attacked by a pack of ''Tyrannosaurus'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'', during which Crabb escapes in his strutter and the head of the ceratopsian strutter is ripped off.

After escaping the carnivores, Arthur realizes that the ''Tyrannosaurus'' at the ruins may have been guarding the mythical ruby sunstone, and takes his strutter back into the Rainy Basin with Oriana and Bix to discover it. Along the way, they come across a trapped juvenile ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' and free it. The grateful father, named Stinktooth, protects Arthur and his companions from the tyrannosaurs and allows them passage into the ruins.

Inside the temple, Bix reveals that in the past, people have escaped the island and brought with them culture from Dinotopian civilizations, influencing ancient [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] civilizations.

However, they are too late, as Crabb has arrived first and taken the ruby sunstone. Vowing to escape Dinotopia and bring back an army of strutters to plunder the island, he destroys Arthur's strutter with his sea scorpion and escapes. Riding on top of Stinktooth, Arthur chases Lee into the sea and pulls the sunstone out of the power socket in the strutter before Lee can escape. During this chase, Arthur's journal is lost to the ocean where it will be discovered by [[Philippine]] sailors and eventually make its way to the library where [[James Gurney]] discovers it.

At the end, the ruby sunstone is lost, a new romance is suggested between Arthur and Oriana, and Crabb is placed under guard by a pair of ''[[Stygimoloch]]''.

===''First Flight''===
[[File:First Flight.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Dinotopia: First Flight''.]]
''Dinotopia: First Flight'' (1999) was a prequel published by Gurney and included a [[board game]].

The main [[protagonist]] of the story is Gideon Altaire, a flight school student living in the capital city of Poseidos off the Dinotopian mainland, in which all organic life (save for humans) has been replaced by mechanical counterparts. After discovering an injured ''[[Scaphognathus]]'' named Razzamult, Gideon discovers that the city is planning to launch an attack on the mainland and conquer all of Dinotopia and that they have stolen the ruby sunstone from the pterosaur home of Highnest.

Gideon sneaks into a factory and discovers an enormous air scorpion attack strutter under construction. He locates and steals the ruby sunstone and frees a group of captive [[pterosaur]]s before escaping to the mainland in a police skimmer. He arrives only to find the island already under attack. He discovers and enlists the help of a band of indigenous creatures- Binny, a ''[[Necrolemur]]'', Bandy, a ''[[Plesictis]]'', Bongo, a ''[[Plesiadapis]]'', and Budge, an ''[[Estemmenosuchus]]''. During their trek towards Highnest, they are ambushed by a spider like attack strutter which proceeds to steal the ruby sunstone.

Gideon and his band reach Highnest, where they help the pterosaurs evacuate the eggs, then take to the air atop their pterosaurs to engage the air scorpion. During the battle, Gideon manages to pull the ruby sunstone out of the flying machine's power socket, causing it to crash and stopping the invasion of Dinotopia.

Gideon is presented as the first ever Skybax rider, although the species he rode wasn't a ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]] northropi''.

===''Journey to Chandara''===
[[File:Journey to Chandara.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara''.]]
A fourth Dinotopia book by James Gurney, ''Dinotopia: Journey to Chandara'', was published in October 2007.&lt;ref name=Dinotopia/&gt; In it, Hugo Khan, the mysterious and reclusive emperor of Chandara, an empire long since isolated from the rest of Dinotopia, has heard of Arthur Denison and Bix's exploits and sends them a personal invitation to his court. Along the way, the duo encounter several new locals, including an old musician named Cornelius Mazurka and his companion ''[[Therizinosaurus]]'' Henriette in the ruins of an old city, a town called Bilgewater made completely out of salvaged ships that the inhabitants believe will carry them into another world, and Jorotongo, a consistently festive and completely nomadic village composed of pilgrims from the ''Sunflower'', sister ship to the ''Mayflower''.

Eventually, they meet Lee Crabb en route at Sauropolis, who escapes from his ''Stygimoloch'' guards and steals the invitation. Without proper passes for the border guards, Arthur and Bix are forced to sneak through the swamp of Blackwood Flats while evading packs of carnivorous ''Allosaurus''. After passing through the mountain city of Thermala, the duo encounter Neighbor Dooh, a bandit who steals all the possessions of passing travelers and compensates them with the possessions of the previous victim. Although Arthur loses all of his scientific equipment, he is given a set of desert robes which allow him and Bix to blend into a Chandaran caravan and pass the border without harassment from the guards.

They stop by the ruins of Ebulon, where Arthur finds Will and Sylvia preparing for an air-jousting tournament. Soon after that, they make their way to the capital city of Chandara. By the time they arrive, they find themselves with few possessions left to barter save for ideas, so Arthur sets up shop in the Marketplace of Ideas. During the night, the writings at Arthur's stand catches the attention of the emperor and he and Bix are invited into the court.

Once at the court, they discover that Lee Crabb has also entered the court under the guise of Arthur Denison and is attempting to gather up a stockpile of weapons, arguing that he is preparing for a ''Tyrannosaurus'' invasion. Hugo Khan finally reveals himself to be a small ''[[Microraptor]]'', and the real Denison promptly exposes Crabb. Khan punishes Crabb by assigning him to be a chef for a band of ''[[Acrocanthosaurus]]'' [[Shaolin Monastery|Shaolin-monks]], who ate their last chef after he failed to satisfy them.

To commemorate Arthur and Bix's presence on the court, Hugo Khan flies out during the night to find a child in sorrow. The next day, Arthur, Bix, and a handful of the Emperor's selected entertainers arrive at the house of and greet Rita Rose and Jeffer, an [[orphan]]ed ''[[Europasaurus]]'' hatchling who has lost the ability to walk. At the end of the day, Hugo Khan expresses his wish for Chandara to be reopened culturally to the rest of Dinotopia. Arthur and Bix accept the Emperor's offers to stay in Chandara for a while to fully discover the city and its culture.

The only hope for a peaceful solution lies with Redstripe, an Armakian ''Smilodon'' leader, and Cai Rochelle, a 13-year-old human boy who is the younger brother to 30-year-old Moraine Rochelle, the human Habitat Partner of Alpine who works with Bigtusk the Dinotopian [[woolly mammoth]].

They turn everything into a contest! So Steelgaze sends them out together on a quest for a hidden prize at the Time Towers, that prize being a map that supposedly holds the secret to a way out of Dinotopia's reef barrier – it must not fall into the wrong hands. But someone has stolen the prize (Lee Crabb is a primary suspect), and the two must track the thief across the rugged terrain of southern Dinotopia. Unfortunately, their constant competition makes progress nearly impossible. It's not until they help a shipwrecked human girl named Teegan [[Clan MacGregor|MacGregor]], from [[Scotland]], that they see the value of cooperating – and just in time, because now they must face the dangerous rapids of Waterfall City's Thunder Falls!
# '''''Firestorm''''' by [[Gene De Weese]] – All of western Dinotopia is in an uproar.

Gwen's father, Eric (a farmer who was originally a dolphinback from England that first ended up in Dinotopia in 1850), is suffering from a deadly disease, and Odon, once one of Dinotopia's wisest healers, is their last hope for a cure. Will the three friends make it through Odon's maze? And even if they do, how will they ever convince this mysterious hermit to help them.

Garland]] – Loro the human likes to watch the caravans of armored ''[[Brachiosaurus]]'' leave his town and cross the bridge into the dangerous jungles of the Rainy Basin.

Two full-length adult fantasy novels were also issued with Gurney's authority, written by [[Alan Dean Foster]]: ''Dinotopia Lost'' (1996) and ''The Hand of Dinotopia'' (1999).

==TV miniseries==
{{main|Dinotopia (miniseries)}}
A 2002 four-hour TV mini-series produced by [[Hallmark Entertainment]] was also based on James Gurney's work, and was advertised as the first "mega-series." The show featured new characters such as Zippo (changed to Zippeau for the TV series to avoid legal issues with the lighter maker Zippo), a [[troodon]] who is said to have worked with Sylvia; the sunstones, a technology restricted to the lost city of Poseidos in the books, are commonplace in the miniseries.  The failure both of the sunstones and of Dinotopian officials to adhere to the underlying meanings of their culture's philosophy caused several discontented people – a leader-in-training, Zippeau himself, and two twentieth-century Dolphinbacks, Karl and David – to embark on a quest that led ultimately to the World Beneath. The series is presented as a sequel of sorts to the books: Will Denison's daughter followed her father into the Skybax corps (an order acknowledged to be founded by Gideon Altaire), Oriana's granddaughter is the female protagonist, the character Zippo is said to have been the dinosaur partner of Sylvia (here the Nursery overseer and not a Skybax rider), and Lee Crabb's son Cyrus features as the [[antagonist]]. The mini-series won an Emmy for its special effects.

===Code of Dinotopia===
In the world of Dinotopia, the Code of Dinotopia is an ancient stone tablet citing the rules of living in Dinotopia. As the part of the tablet cracked since it was first carved, the last portion of it had been missing, but was recovered in the TV mini-series ''[[Dinotopia (TV miniseries)|Dinotopia]]''. The code itself is as follows:

:'''S'''urvival of all or none.
:'''O'''ne raindrop raises the sea.
:'''W'''eapons are enemies, even to their owners.

:'''G'''ive more, take less.
:'''O'''thers first, self last.
:'''O'''bserve, listen and learn.
:'''D'''o one thing at a time.

:'''S'''ing every day.
:'''E'''xercise imagination.
:'''E'''at to live, don't live to eat.
:'''D'''on't p...

The recovered first letters of each sentence spell out "SOW GOOD SEED". It was first written in the Dinotopian alphabet. In the TV mini-series, the 11th code began with ''Fin...'' and was found to be "Find the light".

In the original book by James Gurney, the last line of the code was a small joke amongst the historians and the librarian, who seemed to think it could have been "Don't pee in the bath" referencing the Saurian community's distaste with some humans' lack of cleanliness and hygiene. This was never elaborated on further or confirmed to be true though. Another theory is "Don't put off work for tomorrow that can be done today".

==TV series==
{{Main|Dinotopia (TV series)}}
A TV series of thirteen episodes was produced later in 2002 as a result of the success of the mini-series, but none of the cast of the mini-series reprised their roles. In the later TV series, a group of people known as Outsiders live outside the laws of Dinotopia and pose an additional danger aside from the featured antagonists, which include ''[[Pteranodon]]'', ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'', and ''[[Postosuchus]]''.

ABC originally planned to launch the series in September 2002, but decided to wait until Thanksgiving.&lt;ref name=Dailynews/&gt; ABC was somewhat disappointed by the initial 5.7&amp;nbsp;million viewers and the poor ratings, but continued to air the series for a little while longer, pointing out that it had been an "odd viewing night overall."&lt;ref name=Dailynews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/12/03/2002-12-03__dinotopia__gets_chance_to_a.html |title='Dinotopia' Gets Chance to Avoid Extinction |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Petrozzello |first=Donna |date=3 December 2002 |work=Daily News|location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208152216/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2002/12/03/2002-12-03__dinotopia__gets_chance_to_a.html |archivedate=8 December 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was finally canceled in December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/dec/17/entertainment/et-lowry17 |title=ABC's 'Dinotopia' is a thing of the past |accessdate=14 October 2008 |last=Lowry |first=Brian |date=17 December 2002 |work=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only six of the thirteen episodes were aired on ABC, but all thirteen were broadcast the following year in Europe and were released onto a three-disc DVD box set.

Science-fiction veteran [[David Winning]] directed two episodes of the series, and location shooting lasted for three months near [[Budapest]], Hungary. [[Georgina Rylance]] played Marion Waldo, and [[Lisa Zane]] portrayed her old friend LeSage, the leader of the Outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick S. Clarke, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' vol. 34 (2002), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Brandon]], [[Jonathan Hyde]], and [[Erik von Detten]] also star in the series.

===DVD releases===
[[Artisan Entertainment]] released the complete series on DVD in Region 1 for the first time on 20 January 2004.  This release has been discontinued and is out of print. On 15 March 2016, [[Mill Creek Entertainment]] re-released the complete series on DVD in Region 1.&lt;ref name="2016DVD"&gt;[http://tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dinotopia-The-Series/21827 'The Series' to be Re-Released in 2016 by Mill Creek Entertainment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218123506/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Dinotopia-The-Series/21827 |date=18 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
===Animated film===
There is also a 2005 [[traditional animation|traditionally animated]] movie called ''[[Dinotopia: Quest for the Ruby Sunstone]]''. This film deviated from the original books even more than the mini-series by featuring Ogthar, a mythical ruler of the World Beneath (mentioned in the mini-series), as a human [[warlord]] rather than a benevolent, if commanding, emperor.

===Video games===
A number of ''Dinotopia'' video games have been produced:

The '''Disaster Resource Network''' ('''DRN'''), an initiative of the [[World Economic Forum]], was the first non-governmental organization to donate to the [[United Nations]]' [[CERF]], a fund created to aid regions threatened by [[starvation]] and disasters, particularly [[Africa]]n [[nation]]s.  DRN organizes and mobilizes business sector resources to provide assistance in response to disasters around the world.

==Environmental issues==

===Historic===
The [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump]] was a health crisis in which [[Trafigura]] illegally dumped toxic waste in up to 12 sites around [[Abidjan]] in August 2006.

===Current===
[[Palm oil]] is one of the commodities exported by Côte d'Ivoire and the plantations have an environmental impact. Palmci, the main palm oil company, said that environmentalists had caused it to abandon plans for a palm oil plantation in the Tanoe forest wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.climateark.org/shared/reader/welcome.aspx?linkid=125704&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2734">'''Guglielmo II da Verona''' (died 1273/1275) was a  [[Lombardy|Lombard]] noble from the [[triarchy of Negroponte]] ([[Euboea]]), considered by earlier historians as a triarch and a [[marshal]] of the [[principality of Achaea]] in [[Frankish Greece]].

He was the second&lt;ref&gt;the first, according to K. Hopf despite his primary source, Marino Sanudo&lt;/ref&gt; son of [[Guglielmo I da Verona]], ruler of the southern third ("triarchy") of Euboea.&lt;ref&gt;Loenertz, p 162&lt;/ref&gt;

According to earlier historians following [[Karl Hopf|K. Hopf]], he succeeded to this position upon his father's death in 1263/6. He was also thought to have become [[Baron of Passavant]] and marshal in the Principality of Achaea from an hypothetical marriage to [[Margaret of Passavant|Margaret de Neuilly]],&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1886), pp. 333, 350&lt;/ref&gt; because he was improperly called "marshal" in [[Marino Sanuto the Elder|Sanudo]]'s ''Istoria di Romania''.&lt;ref&gt;It was in fact his wife who became "marshaless" through her second marriage with [[John of Saint Omer]] (Loenertz p 164 and 170)&lt;/ref&gt; These views have been challenged by  [[Raymond-Joseph Loenertz]] in the 1960s.

He married Catherine, a niece of [[William II of Villehardouin]],&lt;ref&gt;Loenertz p 170&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had no known child.
 
Guglielmo was killed in the [[Battle of Demetrias]], which took place either in 1273 or in 1275.&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1886), pp. 337–338, 350&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geanakoplos (1959), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1848">'''Hafskip''' was [[Iceland]]'s second-largest shipping line before its collapse which became a national [[scandal]].

The firm had fallen deep into [[debt]] through its investment in new ships, intended to help the firm compete with [[Eimskip]] and American shipping firms in the transatlantic shipping trade. It was declared bankrupt on December 6, 1985; this led in turn to the collapse of its main lending bank, [[Útvegsbanki]] (the Fisheries Bank of Iceland). Partly because of Hafskip's ties to Iceland's [[finance minister]] [[Albert Guðmundsson]], who was its former [[chairman]] and still a [[shareholder]] at the time of the firm's collapse, Hafskip's bankruptcy became a fuel for rival politicians, and ignited a criminal investigation which lasted six years.

[[Björgólfur Guðmundsson]], Hafskip's managing director, and the Hafskip executives Pill Bragi Kristjónsson, Ragnar Kjartansson and the company's auditor, Helgi Magnússon, were detained and later charged with 450 criminal counts, from [[embezzlement]] to [[fraud]]. Björgólfur Guðmundsson was found guilty on five counts of minor [[bookkeeping]] offenses and sentenced to 12 months' [[probation]].

There was also another scandal with the same company that happened in 1978. But the second incident was larger.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3549">[[File:Hyottoko-karlcow-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|180px|Hyottoko mask]]

{{nihongo|'''Hyottoko'''|火男}} is a comical Japanese character, portrayed through the use of a mask. His mouth is puckered and skewed to one side. Some masks have different eye sizes between the left and right eyes. He is often wearing a scarf around his head (usually white with blue dots). There is a similar character for women called {{nihongo||阿亀|Okame}} or {{nihongo||阿多福|Otafuku}}.

The origin of the name comes from {{Nihongo|"fire"|火|hi}} and {{Nihongo|"man"|男|otoko}}, because the character is blowing fire with a bamboo pipe, hence the shape of the mouth. Local dialects transformed it into ''Hyottoko'' (ひょっとこ), palatalizing ''hio'' to ''hyo'' and making the /t/ geminate.

== History ==
Hyottoko seems to have been a legendary character in Japan in the past, and is now a stock character.

In [[Iwate Prefecture]], there is a myth about the origin of Hyottoko. In the story, there was a boy with a bizarre face who could create gold out of his belly button, so when someone died in a house, you would put the mask of this boy at the top of the fireplace to bring good fortune to the house. The name of the boy was ''Hyoutokusu'' (ヒョウトクス). This is considered one of the possible names that lend plausibility to the origin of Hyottoko.

In some parts of north eastern Japan, Hyottoko is regarded as the god of fire. There is a well known folk story in the form of music, ''izumoyasugibushi'' (出雲安来節) where a fisherman dances with a bamboo basket, having the same visual expression as the mask of Hyottoko. During this dance, a person puts five yen coins on their nose. This is similar to  myth of Iwate prefecture. Izumo is the old name of Iwate prefecture{{disputed-inline|Izumo|date=January 2015}} and Izumo was famous for its iron industry.{{clarify|date=January 2015}} The dance was part of a dedication for fire and steel. 

Hyottoko also appears in traditional dance ''[[dengaku]]'' (田楽). He plays the role of a clown. Dancers wearing Hyottoko masks also appear in some Japanese local festivals. One of the most famous Hyottoko dances takes place in [[Miyazaki Prefecture]] - ''Hyuga Hyottoko Natsumatsuri'' (日向ひょっとこ夏祭り). The Hyotokko dance is believed to originate in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hyottoko.jp/fs/ Hyuga hyottoko summer festival, Miyazaki Prefecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture==

* Hyottoko is used in ''[[Rurouni Kenshin]]'' as the name of [[List of Rurouni Kenshin characters#Hyottoko|a character]].
* In the ''[[Death Note]]'' live action movies, L ([[Ken'ichi Matsuyama]]) uses a Hyottoko mask to hide his identity from the second Kira.
* In the 2017 video game [[Nioh]], players can use a Hyottoko mask item in-game to blow fire around their character.
* In the video game [[Persona 3]], the character Fuuka comments on a Hyottoko mask when at a festival.
* In the anime [[The Eccentric Family]], all henchmen of the Ebisugawa family wear this mask and are never seen without it.

'''Ivanovych''' or '''Ivanovich''' ({{lang-uk|[[:wikt:en:Іванович|Іванович]]}}) is a Ukrainian patryrnom and patryrnomic surname meaning "Son of Ivan" (-ych -ov [[:wikt:en:Ivan|Ivan]]; {{lang-uk|[[:wikt:en:-ич|-ич]] [[:wikt:en:-ов|-ов]] Іван}}).&lt;ref&gt;Roma Franko, ''Ukrainian for Speakers of English Text: Introductory and Intermediate Levels'' (1994), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; The patryrnomic form is created with the suffix -ovych ({{lang-uk|[[:wikt:en:-ович|-ович]]}}), the Ukrainian equivalent of [[:wikt:en:-son|"-son"]] or [[:wikt:en:-sson|"-sson"]] ('s son), attached to [[Ivan (name)|Ivan]] ({{lang-uk|[[:wikt:en:Іван|Іван]]}}; ''lit.'' [[:wikt:en:John|John]]). Ivan is the Ukrainian form of "[[John (name)|John]]", so [[:wikt:en:Ivanovych|''Ivanovych'']] is equivalent to '[[Johnson (surname)|Johnson]]' or '[[Johnsson]]'. Thus ''Ivanovych'' can be translated as "Son of John" or "John's Son". This is one of several ways that "Ivan" can be turned into a surname, with at least thirty-six reported variants including [[Ivanenko]], Ivaniuk, and Ivanchuk.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Pihach, ''Ukrainian Genealogy: A Beginner's Guide'' (2007), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a postdoctoral research position at [[Oregon State University]], she joined the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1984.

== Career and impact ==
Talley has worked at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], [[University of California, San Diego|UCSD]] since 1984, and has been a Distinguished Professor since 2012. While at [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography|Scripps]], her research has combined analysis of ocean observations with advanced theoretical work to describe and map large-scale circulation. Talley’s research focuses on the general circulation of the ocean and the role of various oceanic and atmospheric conditions that affect ocean currents and property distributions, including [[salinity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scrippsscholars.ucsd.edu/ltalley|title=L. Talley|website=Research Profiles|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work involves analysis of data from most of the world’s oceans, depicting the movement of heat, salinity, and water masses, and the formation of [[water mass]]es, particularly in [[Oceanic climate|subpolar]] regions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From 2004-2007 she was a lead author of the  [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]](IPCC) Working Group and a lead author of the Fourth Assessment Report Working Group I chapter of the group's final report titled: "Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/articles/2007/01/18/environment/966ipcc011807.txt|title=Global Climate Report Shaped by Local Hands|date=18 January 2007|publisher=[[Voice of San Diego]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/ch5.html|title=Chapter 5: Observations: Oceanic Climate Change and Sea Level - AR4 WGI|website=www.ipcc.ch|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in February 2007. The report earned contributing scientists a share of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize]] later that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2007/index.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2007|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also a lead author on the same topic for the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report.]]

In addition to numerous academic publications, she has published a widely used graduate level textbook on descriptive physical oceanography, and two oceanographic atlases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swift|first1=Lynne D. Talley, George L. Pickard, William J. Emery, James H.|title=Descriptive physical oceanography : an introduction|date=2011|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9780750645522|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Hydrographic Atlas of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE)|volume=2: Pacific Ocean|url=http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/whp_atlas/pacific/atlas_text/WHPAtlas_Vol2_Pacific_Introduction.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research and international/national committee work include a focus on ocean climate variability/change. She has played a leadership role in scientific planning and execution of international programs, including the [[World Ocean Circulation Experiment]] (WOCE) of the 1990s and the [http://ushydro.ucsd.edu/ CLIVAR/CO2 Repeat Hydrography Program] of the 2000s to present.

In 2000, Talley and co-principal investigator, Daniel Rudnick, worked with moorings and hydrography on the collaborative ''[[Sea of Okhotsk|Okhotsk Sea]] dense water formation project.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~ltalley/okhotsk/|title=Dense Water Formation in the Okhotsk Sea|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005-2006, Talley spent time in the field using hydrography, CTD, and profiling floats to understand [[Antarctic Intermediate Water]] formation in the southeast Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-pord.ucsd.edu/~ltalley/aaiw/|title=Process study of Antarctic Intermediate Water formation|website=www-pord.ucsd.edu|access-date=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlapping this time period, between 2005 and 2007, Talley also participated as part of the CLIMODE team on the ''[http://www.climode.org/ CLIVAR Mode Water Dynamics Experiment (CLIMODE)].''

In 2009, Talley spent time on sabbatical at ''[[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] as a Visiting Scientist.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=14959&amp;tid=282&amp;cid=46986|title=Tickling the Ivories and Tackling the Pacific|date=2000-03-01|website=Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution|access-date=2016-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year she took sabbatical at the ''[[Universite de Grenoble]] Joseph Fourier'' for sciences, health, technologies.

Talley has a long history of seagoing experiences. As a graduate student in 1978 she joined the hydrography cruise through the Southwestern South Pacific aboard the ''[[RV Knorr|R/V Knorr]].'' Between 1993 and 1997, Talley returned to the ''R/V Knorr'' serving as chief scientist on three separate [[World Ocean Circulation Experiment|WOCE]] hydrography cruises in the Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Subpolar North Atlantic. She has additionally sampled the Pacific and Atlantic waters as part of the WOCE Field Program aboard various research vessels including the ''R/V T. Washington'' (1984, co-chief scientist; 1991, chief scientist),  [[RV Thomas G. Thompson (T-AGOR-23)|''R/V T. Thompson'']] (1985, chief scientist), [[RV Oceanus|''R/V Oceanus'']] (1988, co-chief scientist), and ''[[R/V Melville (AGOR-14)|R/V Melville]]'' (1989, chief scientist).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sam.ucsd.edu/talley_CV.html|title=Curriculum Vitae: L. D. Talley|website=sam.ucsd.edu|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, Talley served as chief scientist on the ''R/V Revelle'' sampling hydrography in the Japan/East Sea and then again as co-chief scientist aboard the Khromov in 1999 and 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ships/revelle|title=R/V Roger Revelle|website=scripps.ucsd.edu|publisher=Scripps Institution of Oceanography|access-date=2016-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, she served as chief scientist for the GO-SHIP hydrography, CTC, float deployment cruise in the Southern Pacific aboard the ''[[Nathaniel B. Palmer (icebreaker)|R/V N.B. Palmer.]]''

Since 2016, Talley has led the observation team of the [[SOCCOM project]]: ''Southern Ocean Carbon and Climate Observations and Modeling (SOCCOM)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soccom.princeton.edu/content/programs|title=Programs {{!}} SOCCOM|website=soccom.princeton.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://soccom.princeton.edu/team/talley|title=Talley {{!}} SOCCOM|website=soccom.princeton.edu|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is deploying biogeochemical profiling Argo floats throughout the Southern Ocean south of 30S. Her research group is involved directly in float, hydrographic and satellite data analysis, interfacing with the Southern Ocean State Estimate and data-model comparisons. She also continues to act as co-chair to the steering committee of the ongoing ''U.S. GO-SHIP''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usgoship.ucsd.edu/people/|title=US GO-SHIP Program|website=usgoship.ucsd.edu|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which organizes and carries out the U.S. component of the international GO-SHIP program of deep-sea hydrographic cruises throughout the world's oceans.

The '''Network Institute for Global Democratization''' (NIGD) is an organisation aimed at contributing to worldwide democratisation. The institute was established in 1997, with its headquarters in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] and a second office based in [[Lima]], [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uia.org/s/or/en/1100021985 {{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;NIGD is a founding member of the international Council of the [[World Social Forum]]. 

==Goals and Activities==

NIGD is made up of a transnational network of 78 researchers and activists, who together strive to promote democratization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nigdwp.kaapeli.fi/?page_id=2|title=About|work=kaapeli.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;This network works to strengthen an incipient [[global civil society]] and define an alternative globalization through cross-cultural dialogue and concrete proposals for reform. 
To this end, its practices include original critical research and policy analysis, as well as organizing workshops, seminars and conferences and consultancy work.

'''Reinet Investments S.C.A.''' is a [[Luxembourg]]-based [[investment vehicle]] that was demerged from the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[luxury goods]] company [[Richemont]] on 20 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reinet.com/about-reinet/reinet-formation.html |title=Reinet Formation  |accessdate=2009-01-18 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Reinet Investments }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is listed on the [[Luxembourg Stock Exchange]] (LuxSE), and at 2014 is the second-largest component of the [[LuxX Index]].

==History==
Upon formation, Reinet controlled €350m in cash, €50m in miscellaneous investments, and a 4% stake (84.3 million shares) in [[British American Tobacco|British American Tobacco (BAT)]].  On the first day of Reinet trading, BAT's share price opened at £17.31,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q/hp?s=BATS.L |title=Historical Share Prices |accessdate=2009-01-18 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; valuing Reinet's stake at £1.46bn (€1.88bn).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=GBPEUR=X#chart1:symbol=gbpeur=x;range=1y;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=off;source=undefined |title=GBP to EUR (GBPEUR=X) |accessdate=2009-01-18 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=[[Yahoo!]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation of Reinet allowed the [[Rupert family]] to spin off all non-luxuries related activities, and allow Richemont to focus purely on its core investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reinet.com/about-reinet.html |title=About Reinet Investments S.C.A |accessdate=2009-01-18 |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher=Reinet Investments }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, Reinet entered into negotiations to purchase the [[private equity]] business of [[Lehman Brothers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aPMFewgUfgD0&amp;refer=home |title=Lehman Said to Be in Talks to Sell Fund to Managers, Reinet |accessdate=2009-01-18 |last=Saitto |first=Serena |date=9 January 2009 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now known as [[Trilantic Capital Partners]].

==Investment Strategy==
Reinet states that its investment strategy is to take a long-term view of investment opportunities, to invest in a wide range of asset classes (including listed and unlisted equities, bonds, real estate and derivative instruments), while emphasis will at all times be on the protection of shareholders’ capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reinet.com/investment-strategy.html|website=Company website|title=Reinet Investments S.C.A. - Investment Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company does not publicise a list of its investments other than in BAT.

'''''The Cambridge Medieval History''''' is a history of [[medieval Europe]] in eight volumes published by [[Cambridge University Press]] and Macmillan between 1911 and 1936. Publication was delayed by the First World War and changes in the editorial team.

==Origins==
The work was planned by [[John Bagnell Bury]], [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Modern History]] at [[Cambridge University]], along lines developed by his predecessor, [[Lord Acton]], for ''[[The Cambridge Modern History]]''. The first editors appointed were [[Henry Melvill Gwatkin]], [[Mary Bateson (historian)|Mary Bateson]], and [[G. T. Lapsley|G.T. Lapsley]]. [[James Pounder Whitney]] replaced Mary Bateson following her death in 1906. When G.T. Lapsley retired due to ill health, his place was not filled so that the editors of the first two volumes were Gwatkin and Whitney.&lt;ref name=pref1&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cambridgemedieva009698mbp#page/n9/mode/2up "General Preface"] in ''The Cambridge Medieval History Volume I The Christian Roman Empire and the Foundation of the Teutonic Kingdoms'', Macmillan, New York, 1911. pp. v.-vi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
In the preface to the first volume, the editors expressed the wish that the work would be an interesting read for the general user as well as "a summary of ascertained facts, with indications (not discussions) of disputed points". They claimed, "there is nothing in the English language resembling the present work" and wrote, optimistically, that they "hoped to publish two volumes yearly in regular succession".&lt;ref name=pref1/&gt; In fact, the final volume was not published until 1936.

The history aimed to encompass the whole of European medieval history so that the editors were obliged to use a wide range of contributors in order to adequately treat the subject. In particular in relation to volume 2 (''The Rise of the Saracens and the Foundation of the Western Empire'') the editors complained that "students of history in this country [England] seldom turn their attention to any part of it" and thus "very little has ever been written in English, [on subjects] such as the Visigoths in Spain, the organisation of Imperial Italy and Africa, the Saracen invasions of Sicily and Italy, and the early history and expansion of the Slavs".&lt;ref name=pref2&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cambridgemedieva02buryuoft#page/n9/mode/2up "Preface"] in ''The Cambridge Medieval History Volume II The Rise of the Saracens and the Foundation of the Western Empire'', Macmillan, New York, 1913. pp. v-viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Volumes==
Volumes one and two were published in 1911 and 1913, keeping to the expectation of the editors that the work would move through its volumes at a fast pace.

Volume three, however, was delayed until 1922 by the First World War, which made international collaboration more difficult, and after German scholars had been replaced by British ones due to worries about how the volume would be received in Britain. Some went unpaid as they had signed no contract. A collection was organised for the great German Latinist [[Max Manitius]] which raised £10 after he wrote that the war had left him in poverty. Contributors to volumes four and six were similarly effected.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2848689 "The Making of the Cambridge Medieval History"] by P.A. Linehan, ''[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]'', Vol. 57, No. 3 (July 1982), pp. 463-494.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the preface to volume II of ''[[The New Cambridge Medieval History]]'' in 1995, [[Rosamond McKitterick]] commented on the "unhappy legacy of the old volume III when the principles of scholarship were sullied with political enmities and many scholars excluded as authors because of their nationality", a fault that she felt was expunged in the new history.&lt;ref&gt;"Preface" by Rosamond McKitterick in ''The New Cambridge Medieval History''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1995. p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The editors of volume three were Gwatkin, Whitney, [[Joseph Robson Tanner]], and [[Charles William Previté-Orton]]. The volume was criticised in review for duplication in its coverage of events and definitions, and a failure to cross-reference material,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2142551 "''The Cambridge Medieval History: (Germany and the Western Empire)''"]. Review by: Austin P. Evans, ''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'', Vol. 38, No. 1 (March 1923), pp. 156-159.&lt;/ref&gt; but later commentators saw this as the inevitable consequence of the structure of the work as a collection of scholarly essays drawn from a range of international contributors over 25 years, disrupted by war and changes of editor, rather than an organic synthesis prepared by a small group over a short time-frame.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25014235 "An Appreciation of the ''Cambridge Medieval History''"] by [[Martin R.P. McGuire]] in ''[[The Catholic Historical Review]]'', Vol. 29, No. 1 (April 1943), pp. 60-64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volumes four to seven (1923-32) were edited by Tanner, Previté-Orton and [[Zachary Nugent Brooke]] (1883-1946) after Brooke replaced Whitney on his retirement. After Tanner died in 1931, volume eight (1936) was completed by Previté-Orton and Brooke.

In 1966 and 1967, a new edition of volume four was published in two parts edited by [[Joan Hussey]] that incorporated developments in the field of Byzantine studies in the forty years since the original was published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/doc/rebyz_0766-5598_1968_num_26_1_1414_t1_0412_0000_2 ''The Cambridge Medieval History, Volume IV, The Byzantine Empire, Part I, Byzantium and its Neighbours, Part II, Government, Church and Civilisation'', edited by J.
