==Content==
It deals with standard problems in the theory of [[personal identity]] in the form of a dialogue between a terminally ill university professor at a small Midwestern college,, Gretchen Weirob, and her two friends, Sam Miller and Dave Cohen. The views represented include those of [[Bernard Williams]], [[John Locke]], and [[Derek Parfit]]. The format of associating different philosophical positions with different characters in a dialogue recalls [[David Hume]]'s ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''.

[[Image:Alte Oper Frankfurt am Main 2012.jpg|thumb|240px|Alte Oper façade]]
The original opera house in Frankfurt is now the '''Alte Oper''' (''Old Opera''), a [[concert hall]] and former [[opera house]] in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. It was inaugurated in 1880 but destroyed by bombs in 1944. It was rebuilt, slowly, in the 1970s, opening again in 1981. Many important operas were performed for the first time in Frankfurt, including [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' in 1937.

The square in front of the building is known as [[Opernplatz]] (Opera Square). The Alte Oper is located in the inner city district, [[Innenstadt (Frankfurt am Main)|Innenstadt]], within the banking district [[Bankenviertel]].

Frankfurt Opera is now in [[Opern- und Schauspielhaus Frankfurt|a modern building nearby]], completed in 1951, which it shares with a theatre company.

==Inauguration==
[[Image:Oper1880.jpg|thumb|240px|Frankfurt Opera House, c. 1880]]
The building was designed by the [[Berlin]] architect [[Richard Lucae]], financed by the citizens of Frankfurt and built by [[Philipp Holzmann]]. Construction began in 1873.&lt;ref name=gros50&gt;Groß, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; It opened on October 20, 1880. Among the guests was [[Kaiser]] [[Wilhelm I of Germany]], who was impressed and said: ''Das könnte ich mir in Berlin nicht erlauben.'' (''I couldn't permit myself this sort of thing in Berlin.'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.alteoper.de/de/die-alte-oper/unser-haus/chronik.php | title=Chronik und Historie | date=21 December 2009 | website=www.alteoper.de | publisher=Alte Oper Frankfurt Konzert- und Kongresszentrum GmbH | language=German | accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The citizens of Frankfurt, who had to finance the structure (initial estimate two million [[German gold mark|marks]]), were rather sceptical at first.{{Fact|date=October 2007}} Alluding to the inscription on the [[frieze]]

:"''Dem Wahren, Schönen, Guten''", ("''To the true, the beautiful, the good''")

The folkloristic Frankfurt poet [[Adolf Stoltze]] wrote, in his best [[Hessian dialect]]:

:''Dem Wahre, Scheene, Gute, die Berjerschaft muß blute.'' (''To the true, the beautiful, the good, the citizenry must bleed.'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Helmensdorfer |first1=Erich |title=Frankfurt - Metropole am Main: Geschichte und Zukunft |year=1982 |publisher=Econ-Verlag |location=Düsseldorf, Vienna |language=German |isbn=978-3-430-14261-8 |page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post WWII==
[[Image:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F005758-0016A, Frankfurt-Main, Oper.jpg|thumb|240px|Ruins of the Alte Oper in 1958]]
The Alte Oper was almost completely [[Bombing of Frankfurt am Main in World War II|destroyed by bombs]] during [[World War II]] in 1944 (only some of the outside walls and façades survived). In the 1960s the city [[magistrate]] planned to build a modern office building on the site. The then Minister of Economy in Hessen [[Rudi Arndt]], earned the nickname "Dynamit-Rudi" (Dynamite Rudi) when he proposed to blow up "Germany's most beautiful ruin" with "a little [[dynamite]]". Arndt later said that this was not meant seriously.{{Fact|date=October 2007}}

A [[initiative|citizen's initiative]] campaigned for reconstruction funds after 1953 and collected 15 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]. It ended costing c. DM160, and the building was reopened on August 28, 1981, to the sounds of [[Gustav Mahler]]'s [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]], the "Symphony of a Thousand". A live recording of that concert conducted by Michael Gielen is available on CD.

The Alte Oper has:
* The '''''Großer Saal''''' (Large Hall) with 2500 seats. 
* The '''''Mozart-Saal''''',  700 seats.
* and smaller halls for [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].

It lists [[legendary creature|fantastic creatures]] found in [[Bestiary|medieval bestiaries]] as well as those reported by explorers from abroad and gives explanations to why they are excluded from Systema Naturae.

Linnaeus remarked in edition 6 (as translated) as at [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v415/n6871/full/415479a.html this link]: "''I have come to these conclusions by personally leading my pupils on wanderings through the tangled web of nature, in order that I can spur others on to an examination and explanation of nature rather than the reiteration of perceived ideas ... I shall take exception to the tales of actors and the barkings of dogs with equal measure.''".&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Paradoxa'' ==
These 10 taxa appear in the 1st to 5th editions:
* [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]]: Linnaeus wrote: "Hydra: body of a snake, with two feet, seven necks and the same number of heads, lacking wings, preserved in [[Hamburg]], similar to the description of the Hydra of the [[Apocalypse]] of St.John chapters 12 and 13. And it is provided by very many as a true species of animal, but falsely. Nature for itself and always the similar, never naturally makes multiple heads on one body. Fraud and artifice, as we ourselves saw [on it] teeth of a weasel, different from teeth of an Amphibian [or reptile], easily detected." See [[Carl Linnaeus#Doctorate]]. (Distinguish from the small real coelenterate [[Hydra (genus)]].)
* [[Pseudis paradoxa|Rana-Piscis]]: a South American frog which is significantly smaller than its [[tadpole]] stage; it was thus (incorrectly) reported to Linnaeus that the metamorphosis in this species went from 'frog to fish'. In the Paradoxa in the 1st edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus wrote "Frog-Fish or Frog Changing into Fish: is much against teaching. Frogs, like all Amphibia, delight in lungs and spiny bones. Spiny fish, instead of lungs, are equipped with gills. Therefore the laws of Nature will be against this change. If indeed a fish is equipped with gills, it will be separate from the Frog and Amphibia. If truly [it has] lungs, it will be a Lizard: for under all the sky it differs from [[Chondropterygii]] and [[Plagiuri]].". In the 10th edition of Systema Naturae, Linnaeus named the species ''[[Pseudis paradoxa|Rana paradoxa]]'', though its genus name was changed in 1830 to ''[[Pseudis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author =S. W. Garman |year=1877 |title=''Pseudis'', the paradoxical frog |journal=[[The American Naturalist]] |volume=11 |issue=10 |pages=587–591 |url=https://archive.org/stream/americannatural04instgoog#page/n591/mode/2up |jstor=2447862 |doi=10.1086/271961}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Monocerus|Monoceros]] (unicorn): Linnaeus wrote: "Monoceros of the older [generations], body of a horse, feet of a "wild animal", horn straight, long, spirally twisted. It is a figment of painters. The [[Monodon]] of [[Peter Artedi|Artedi]] [= narwhal] has the same manner of horn, but the other parts of its body are very different."
* [[Pelican#Symbolism and popular culture|Pelecanus]]: Linnaeus wrote "Pelican: The same [sources as for the previous] hand down fabulously [the story] that it inflicts a wound with its beak on its own thigh, to feed its young with the flowing blood. A sack hanging below its throat gave a handle for the story." This source&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1= Andy|last1=Dobson|first2=Kevin D.|first3=Armand M. |first4=Ryan F. |first5=Walter|lastauthoramp=y |year=2008 |title=Homage to Linnaeus: How many parasites?

* [[Satyrus (ape)|Satyrus]]: Linnaeus wrote "with a tail, hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen."&lt;ref name="kth.se"&gt;Carl Linnaeus, Systema naturae (1735; facsimile of the first edition), trans.

* [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Borometz]] (aka [[Scythia]]n Lamb): Linnaeus wrote: "Borometz or [[Scythia]]n Lamb: is reckoned with plants, and is similar to a lamb; whose stalk coming out of the ground enters an [[Navel|umbilicus]]; and the same is said to be provided with blood from by chance devouring wild animals. But it is put together artificially from roots of American ferns. But naturally it is an [[allegorical]] description of an ''[[embryo]] of a sheep'', as has all attributed data.".

* [[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]: Linnaeus wrote: "Species of bird, of which only one individual exists in the world, and which when decrepit [arises?] from [its] pyre made of aromatic [plants?] is said fabulously to become again young, to undergo happy former periods of life. In reality it is the [[date palm]], see ''[[Engelbert Kaempfer|Kæmpf]]''".
* Linnaeus wrote: The [[Barnacle goose#Folklore|Bernicla]] or [[Scotland|Scottish]] goose &amp; Goose-bearing Seashell: is believed by former generations to be born from rotten wood thrown away in the sea. But the [[Lepas]] places seaweed on its featherlike internal parts, and somewhat adhering, as if indeed that goose Bernicla was arising from it. [[Frederick Edward Hulme]] noted: "[The] barnacle-goose tree was a great article of faith with our ancestors in the Middle Ages."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Myth-land|author =Hulme, F.E.|date=1886|publisher=S. Low, Marston, Searle &amp; Rivington|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrBZAAAAMAAJ|page=168|accessdate=2015-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dragon|Draco]]: Linnaeus wrote that it has a "snakelike body, two feet, two wings, like a bat, which is a ''[[Draco (genus)|winged lizard]]'' or a ''[[Raja (genus)|ray]]'' artificially shaped as a monster and dried."&lt;ref name="kth.se"/&gt; See also [[Jenny Haniver]].
* [[Death watch beetle|Automa Mortis]] Linnaeus wrote "Death-watch: It produces the sound of a very small clock in walls, is named ''Pediculus pulsatorius'', which perforates wood and lives in it".

The above 10 taxa and the 4 taxa following were in the 2nd (1740) edition and the 4th and 5th editions (total 14 entries):&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Systema naturae in quo naturae regna tria: secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, systematice proponuntur|author =von Linné, C.|date=1740|publisher=Apud G.

* [[Manticore|Manticora]]: Linnaeus wrote merely: "face of a decrepit old man, body of a lion, tail starred with sharp points".
* [[Antelope#Etymology|Antilope]] {{sic}}: Linnaeus wrote merely: "Face of a "wild animal", feet [like those] of cattle, horns like a goat's [but] saw-edged".
* [[Lamia (mythology)|Lamia]]: Linnaeus wrote merely: "Face of a man, breasts of a virgin, body of a four-footed animal [but] scaled, forefeet of a "wild animal", hind[feet] [like those] of cattle".
* [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]: Linnaeus wrote: "''[[Peter Artedi|Art.]] [[Genus|gen.]]'' 81 Syrene ''[[Thomas Bartholin|Bartol]]'': As long as it is not seen either living or dead, nor faithfully and perfectly described, it is called in doubt".
*::Linnaeus's reference is to [[Peter Artedi]]'s writing about the Siren: "Two fins only on all the body, those on the chest. No finned tail. Head and neck and chest to the umbilicus have the human appearance. ... Our or Bartholin's Siren was found and captured in the sea near Massilia in America. From the umbilicus to the extremity of the body was unformed flesh with no sign of a tail. Two pectoral fins on the chest, with five bones or fingers, staying together, by which it swims. Its [[radius (bone)|radius]] in the forearm is scarcely four fingers' width long. Oh that there could arise a true [[ichthyologist]], who could examine this animal, as to whether it is a fable, or a true fish? About something which has not been seen it is preferable not to judge, than boldly to pronounce something.". Among references and quotations from other authors Artedi quoted that "some say that it is a [[manatee]] and others say completely different."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Artedi, 1738, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5XRcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Philosophia Ichthyologica], p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Apparition of the Virgin to St. Bernard''''' is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Renaissance]] painter [[Filippino Lippi]], completed around 1485–1487.&lt;ref&gt;Rowlands, Eliot W., and Marilyn Bradshaw. "Lippi family." Grove Art Online. January 01, 2003. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is housed in the [[Badia Fiorentina]], a church in [[Florence]].

The picture was commissioned for the chapel of Francesco del Pugliese by the latter's son Piero, who is portrayed in the lower right corner in the traditional praying posture of the [[donor portrait]].

It is one of the most admired Lippi's works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 Page at artonline.it] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001102/http://www.artonline.it/opera.asp?IDOpera=1424 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its powerful, Flemish-inspired chromatism and attention to details, which contribute in turning the mystical apparition of the Virgin to [[Bernard of Clairvaux|St. Bernard]] into an everyday life scene. The composition is set in a rocky landscape in which the saint, while writing on his [[lectern]], is suddenly visited by the Virgin. Behind Bernard's shoulders is depicted the demon biting his chains: this is a reference to a medieval hymn celebrating the Virgin as the liberator of humanity from the chains of their sins.

A scroll on a rock contains a verse by the 3rd century AD [[Stoicism|stoic]] writer [[Epictetus]]: ''Sustine et abstine'' ("Carry on and abstain"), a hint to Bernard's teachings.

Some scholars have identified in the faces of the Virgin and the angels on the left the portraits of the donor's wife and sons

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4080">The '''Australian Music Foundation''' [AMF] is a charitable foundation, first established in the United Kingdom, with the chief purpose of providing financial support to outstanding young Australian musicians who wish to pursue post-graduate music courses in leading music education institutions around the globe. It also offers performance opportunities in Australia and abroad, advice and mentoring to awardees.

At inception, the AMF’s activities were centred on the UK, reflecting a historical tradition of strong institutional links between Australian music academies and British institutions such as the [[Royal College of Music]], [[Royal Academy of Music]], the [[Royal Northern College of Music]] and the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]]. In recent years the AMF has more actively expanded its field of activity to include North America, Europe, and South East Asia.

==History==
The AMF was initially established by Deed of Trust declared on 30 December 1975 in the United Kingdom (under the name of 'Australian Musical Foundation in London'), the original Trustees being [[Baron Goodman]], The Hon. [[Sir Davies Hughes]], Mr Robert Norman, Group Cpt [[Douglas Bader]], Mr Sam Lynn, and Mr Guy Parsons. The first awards were made in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://opencharities.org/charities/270784&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 an Australian Trust to support the work of the AMF was created under the name of "The AMF Australia Foundation".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.acnc.gov.au/RN52B75Q?ID=5E9D7244-61C3-4321-9E00-EA7CA91AE360&amp;noleft=1&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barbara Assoon''' (born 1929) is a [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[actress]] and [[journalist]] who has been one of her country's public personalities for six decades.

==Biography==
Barbara Assoon was born in the Trinidad capital, [[Port of Spain]], and began her acting career in the mid-1940s. In 1948 she had a role in a production of [[Peter Ustinov]]'s play ''The Indifferent Shepherd'', and the following year received a scholarship to study acting in [[England]], choosing the Bristol Old Vic school.&lt;ref name="Ogidi"&gt;Ann Ogidi [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/499264/index.html "Assoon, Barbara"], BFI screenonline&lt;/ref&gt; Assoon spent the next 19 years in Britain and appeared in numerous radio, television and stage productions. She performed in many radio soap operas as well as live TV dramas during the 1950s. In 1958, she played Rosa in [[Errol John]]'s play ''Moon On a Rainbow Shawl'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Assoon, Barbara (1929—)", in Martin Banham, Errol Hill &amp; George Woodyard (eds), ''The Cambridge Guide to African &amp; Caribbean Theatre'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994, pp.230-31&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 Barbara Assoon returned to Trinidad to work with [[Radio Trinidad]] as a news reporter and program presenter. She spent the following decades as a broadcasting presenter. Her last appearance in a stage play was in 1990, with [[Derek Walcott]]. She has since retired, but still remains active in training the next generation of journalists.

The '''Church of St Donatus''' is a church located in [[Zadar]], [[Croatia]]. Its name refers to [[Donatus of Zadar]], who began construction on this church in the 9th century and ended it on the northeastern part of the [[forum (Roman)|Roman forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.amzd.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=49 Arheološki Muzej Zadar - Sveti Donat]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Originally named Church of the [[Holy Trinity]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inyourpocket.com/croatia/zadar/sightseeing__culture/essentialzadar/venue/4537-St_Donatus_and_39;_Church.html Essential Zadar], inyourpocket.com; accessed 31 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 15th century it was re-dedicated to St Donatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{hr icon}} [http://www.izaberi.hr/index.php?lang=hr&amp;op=sd&amp;tip=zna&amp;id=0000060 Crkva sv. Donat], izaberi.hr; accessed 31 July 2018.{{hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church is the largest [[Pre-Romanesque]] building in Croatia. It is also an example of the centralised type of the [[Carolingian]] period in Europe.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==
The beginning of the building of the church was placed to the second half of the 8th century, and it is supposed to be completed in the 9th century. The Zadar bishop and diplomat [[Donatus of Zadar|Donat]] (8th and 9th centuries) is credited with the building of the church. He led the representations of the Dalmatian cities to [[Constantinople]] and [[Charles the Great]], which is why this church bears slight resemblance to Charlemagne's court chapels, especially the one in [[Aachen]] (now [[Aachen Cathedral]]),&lt;ref name="Radovinovič"&gt;{{cite book|last=Radovinovič|first=Radovan|title=The Croatian Adriatic|year=1998|publisher=Naklada Naprijed|location=Zagreb|isbn=953-178-097-8|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also to the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raos|first=Ivan|title=Adriatic tourist guide|year=1969|publisher=Spektar|location=Zagreb|OCLC=112865|pages=80|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=OCGhTcSQCcLt0gH08v22Bg&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=AQgzAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=chirch+of+saint++donatus+zadar&amp;q=%22Vitale%27s+Church+in+Ravenna%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It belongs to the Pre-Romanesque architectural period.

The circular church, formerly domed, is 27 m high and is characterised by simplicity and technical primitivism. It has three radially situated [[apse]]s and an [[ambulatory]] around the central area, surmounted by circular gallery. The circular shape is typical of the early medieval age in [[Dalmatia]].&lt;ref name=desc/&gt; It was built on the Roman forum, and materials from buildings in the latter were used in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cvitanic|first=Marilyn|title=Culture and Customs of Croatia (Culture and Customs of Europe)|year=2010|publisher=Greenwood; 1st ed|isbn=978-0-313-35117-4|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpPXFbq9vO4C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=chirch+of+saint++donatus+zadar&amp;hl=cs&amp;ei=Tx6hTZagMqTh0gHm_cj7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the fragments which are built into the foundations it is still possible to distinguish the remains of a sacrificial altar on which is written IVNONI AVGUSTE IIOVI AVGUSTO.&lt;ref name="Radovinovič"/&gt;

The  use of the church has varied during its lifetime; during the rule of the [[Republic of Venice]] it was a warehouse, as well as during the French occupation and under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austrians]]. After the city was annexed to [[Yugoslavia]], it served as an archaeological museum for a short period of time. The building is currently used as the concert venue for the annual International Festival of Medieval Renaissance Music ([[Musical Evenings in St Donatus]]) due to the building's interiors and acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.donat-festival.com/default.asp?lang=en Official site of the Donat musical evenings], donat-festival.com; accessed 31 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Derrière le Miroir''''' is a French art magazine created in 1946 and published until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrien Maeght|title=Derrière le miroir: 1946–1982|publisher=Maeght Éditeur|date=1983|location=Paris|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art galleries, auction houses and booksellers often refer to this art magazine simply as '''D.L.M.'''&lt;ref&gt;Example of art gallery using the abbreviation: [http://www.mchampetier.com/issue-DLM-Derriere-le-Miroir-litographs-Maeght.html] '''D.L.M.'''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''DLM'''.&lt;ref&gt;Example of art gallery using the abbreviation '''DLM''': [http://www.marninart.net/dlm.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aimé Maeght]] is the founder, editor and publisher.

==History==
In October 1945 the French art dealer Aimé Maeght opens his art gallery at 13 Rue de Téhéran in Paris. His beginning coincides with the end of [[Second World War]] and the return of a number of exiled artists back to France.

The magazine was created in October 1946 (n°1) and published without interruption until 1982 (n°253). Its original articles and illustrations (mainly original color [[lithograph]]s by the gallery artists) were famous at the time.

The magazine covered only the artists exhibited by Maeght gallery either through personal or group exhibitions. Among them are (in [[alphabetical order]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Chapon|title =Derrière le miroir n°250: Hommage à Aimé et Marguerite Maeght|publisher=Maeght Éditeur|date=1982|location=Paris|page=111| isbn=2-85587-097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henri-Georges Adam]], [[Pierre Alechinsky]], [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Bacon]], [[Jean Bazaine]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Pol Bury]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Roger Chastel]], [[Eduardo Chillida]], [[Alberto Giacometti]], [[Vassily Kandinsky]], [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Lindner]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Joan Miró]], [[Jacques Monory]], [[Pablo Palazuelo]], [[Paul Rebeyrolle]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Saul Steinberg]], [[Pierre Tal-Coat]], [[Antoni Tapies]], [[Raoul Ubac]], [[Bram van Velde]].

Among the authors publishing essays and poems are (in alphabetical order):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=François Chapon|title=Derrière le miroir n°250: Hommage à Aimé et Marguerite Maeght|publisher=Maeght Éditeur|date=1982|location=Paris|pages=109–110|isbn=2-85587-097-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], [[Marcel Arland]], {{Interlanguage link multi|André Balthazar|fr|3=André Balthazar}}, [[Yves Bonnefoy]], [[André du Bouchet]], [[André Breton]], [[Joan Brossa]], [[Jean Cassou]], [[René Char]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Descargues|fr|3=Pierre Descargues}}, [[Jacques Dupin]], [[Georges Duthuit]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Frank Elgar|fr|3=Frank Elgar}}, [[Claude Esteban]], [[Charles Estienne]], {{Interlanguage link multi|André Frénaud|fr|3=André Frénaud}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Stanislas Fumet|fr|3=Stanislas Fumet}}, [[Jean Grenier]], [[Marcel Jouhandeau]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Kober|fr|3=Jacques Kober}}, [[Michel Leiris]], [[Georges Limbour]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Maldiney|fr|3=Henri Maldiney}}, [[Jean Paulhan]], [[Gaëtan Picon]], [[Francis Ponge]], [[Jacques Prévert]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[Michel Seuphor]], [[Jean Tardieu]], [[Lionello Venturi]], [[Pierre Volboudt]], [[Christian Zervos]].

Following the death of Aimé Maeght in September 1981, the Derrière le Miroir n°250 was designed as a tribute to the work of Aimé Maeght and his wife Marguerite (who had died before him in 1977). This special 112-pages issue was named "Hommage à Aimé et Marguerite Maeght" and was intended to be the last one. As it summarises all contents of the previous issues, it was finalised only in August 1982. In the meantime, n° 251 to 253 (the very last number) were published respectively in February, May and June 1982.

== Numbering system and identification ==

Although the issue numbers go from n°1 to n°253, only 200 issues were published.  From the 200 issues, 157 were single issues, 33 are double-issue (n°11–12 ''Bram et Geer van Velde'', n°14–15 ''Joan Miró'',...) and 10 triple issues (n°36-37-38  ''Sur quatre murs'', n°57-58-59 ''Miró'',...)

For the issue identification:
* The first 6 issues (December 1946 to November 1947) show no printed issue number. 
* The issue n° 7 (February 1948) is the first one showing an issue number (on the cover page).
* From issue n°23 (October–November 1949), the issue numbers appear in the internal pages (mainly on the back side of the last cover).
* All issues from n°213 (March 1975) to the last one (n°253) display an ISBN.

'''Erich Šlomović''' ({{lang-sr-Latn|Erih Šlomović}}, also known as '''Erich Chlomovitch''') (1915–1942) was a [[Jewish]] art collector in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Defined as such in a Dutch source in English: http://www.garyschwartzarthistorian.nl/schwartzlist/?id=66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In French rendered as "juif yougoslave": http://www.artcult.fr/_Judaica/Fiche/Art-0-1249411.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He was an assistant and protégé of [[Ambroise Vollard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/kontroverzna-diplomatska-po%C5%A1iljka-s-ciljem-beograd/a-5745327|title=Kontroverzna diplomatska pošiljka s ciljem - Beograd|publisher=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2010-06-30|language=Croatian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Šlomović was born in [[Đakovo]] ([[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) in 1915 to a [[Jew]]ish family of Bernard and Roza Šlomović. He had a brother, Egon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=D’Arcy|first=David|url=http://www.artnet.com/magazineus/features/darcy/darcy1-10-07.asp|title=The Mysterious Mr. Slomovic|work=[[artnet]]|quote=|date=|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hakol"&gt;{{hr icon}} Ha-Kol (Glasilo Židovske zajednice u Hrvatskoj); Vesna Domany Hardy; ''O zbirci Ericha Šlomovića''; stranica 43, 44, 45, 46; broj 103, siječanj / veljača 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jl&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/slike-koje-je-1939--hrvat-spasio-od-hitlera-idu-na-najvecu-aukciju-godine/737775/|title=Slike koje je 1939.

== Career ==
In the 1930s, Šlomović moved to Paris, where he was befriended by legendary art collector [[Ambroise Vollard]].  Through Vollard, Šlomović met the greatest artists of the age, including Picasso, Matisse, Cocteau, Rouault among others, and was able to amass an impressive personal collection of some 600 works.  Vollard died in a car accident in July 1939.  Shortly after that, with France on the brink of Nazi invasion, Šlomović decided to return to Yugoslavia, where the war had not yet spread. He left about 200 artworks in a vault in the Société Générale in Paris, and the rest he had shipped via diplomatic pouch to Belgrade.  These were exhibited at a highly acclaimed exhibition in Zagreb in 1940.&lt;ref name="hakol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Collection Erich Chlomovitch" Musee National de Belgrade, published by Muzejsko - galerijski centar, Zagreb, Croatia, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
During [[World War II]], with the [[Independent State of Croatia]] establishment in 1941, Šlomović and his family moved to [[Bačina]] in [[Serbia]] in an attempt to save themselves.&lt;ref name="hakol"/&gt;
While in Bačina, Šlomović hid the paintings he brought with him.&lt;ref name="hakol"/&gt; Later, as a part of the German reprisals of 100 Serbian men shot for every German soldier killed, Bernard, Erich and Egon were taken to detention camp in [[Ćuprija]]. Soon after, they were all killed. Erich's mother Rosa and female cousin Mara were not touched and neither was his collection. They both survived the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] hidden by the local population.&lt;ref name="hakol" /&gt;

==Legacy==
After his death, Šlomović mother donated his collection to the [[National Museum of Serbia]]. In 1989 [[Veljko Bulajić]] directed ''[[Donator]]'', a movie dedicated to Šlomović's tragic life while in 2004 [[Momo Kapor]] wrote a book about his life. The paintings in the Société Generale bank were discovered in 1979 when the bank was allowed to open the vault to recover unpaid storage fees. There is a legal dispute over the ownership of those paintings.&lt;ref name="hakol"/&gt;

'''Fascination Books''' was one of [[South Africa]]'s largest book chains with branches throughout South Africa. After 13 years of considerable growth, owner and founder Johan Marais applied for liquidation in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|title=Book chain closes doors: Fin24: Companies|date=2011-07-11|access-date=2017-08-31|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711003053/http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|archivedate=2011-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was the largest independent book chain in the South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|title=Book chain closes doors {{!}} Fin24|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2017-08-31|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212133157/http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|archivedate=2012-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stocked a wide range of books, focussing on religious books, while also stocking a great variety of books in [[Afrikaans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fascinationonline.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=26 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024223822/http://www.fascinationonline.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=26 |archivedate=2008-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Johan Marais ==
{{See also|Johan Marais}}
Beside Johan Marais being the founder and sole owner of the Fascination Books group, he is also the managing director of the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johanmarais.co.za/AboutJohan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He specialises in the field of [[herpetology]] and is currently completing a master's degree at the [[University of Witwatersrand]] under professor Graham Alexander, with whom he collaborated on the book ''Guide to [[Reptiles]] of Southern Africa''. Prior to this he published ''Snake versus Man'' (1994), ''Conservation and Utilization of the [[Nile Crocodile]]'' (1991; with professor Gerrie Smith), ''Snakes of the World'' (1984), ''Snakes and Snakebites'' (2001)  ''What's that Snake?'', a short identification guide on Southern African snakes, as well as ''Snakes of Southern Africa'' (2004; originally published in 1992, then totally rewritten), a complete guide, which was followed by the aforementioned reptile guide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johanmarais.co.za/AboutJohan.htm&lt;/ref&gt; All these books are published by Struik Books South Africa.

== Online Store ==
In April 2008, the company also introduced an online store on its website, with a range of up to 3 million books.  According to Marais, the online store was formed as a separate company and will not be part of the liquidation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|title=Book chain closes doors {{!}} Fin24|date=2012-02-12|access-date=2017-08-31|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212133157/http://www.fin24.com/Companies/Book-chain-closes-doors-20081028|archivedate=2012-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Frida''''' is a 2002 American [[biopic]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Julie Taymor]]. It depicts the professional and private life of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] Mexican [[Painting|painter]] [[Frida Kahlo]]. It stars [[Salma Hayek]] in her [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-nominated portrayal as Kahlo and [[Alfred Molina]] as her husband, [[Diego Rivera]]. The movie was adapted by [[Clancy Sigal]], [[Diane Lake (author)|Diane Lake]], [[Gregory Nava]], [[Anna Thomas]] and unofficially by [[Edward Norton]] from the book ''[[Frida (biography)|Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo]]'' by Hayden Herrera.

''Frida'' received generally positive reviews from critics, and won two [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] among six nominations.

==Plot==
''Frida'' begins just before the [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic accident [[Frida Kahlo]] ([[Salma Hayek]]) suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through [[convalescence]], her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a [[live action]] scene with actors.

''Frida'' also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the [[mural]]ist [[Diego Rivera]] ([[Alfred Molina]]). When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the [[bisexuality|bisexual]] Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera.

The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural ''[[Man at the Crossroads]]'' at the [[Rockefeller Center]]. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a [[miscarriage]], and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his [[communist]] vision of the work to the needs of the patron, [[Nelson Rockefeller]] ([[Edward Norton]]); as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two.

Kahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their [[San Ángel]] studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into [[alcoholism]]. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house [[Leon Trotsky]] ([[Geoffrey Rush]]), who has been granted [[political asylum]] in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his [[Coyoacán]] home.

Kahlo leaves for Paris after Diego realizes she was unfaithful to him with Trotsky; although Rivera had little problem with Kahlo's other affairs, Trotsky was too important to Rivera to be intimately involved with his wife. When she returns to Mexico, he asks for a divorce. Soon afterwards, Trotsky is murdered in [[Mexico City]]. Rivera is temporarily a suspect, and Kahlo is incarcerated in his place when he is not found. Rivera helps get her released.

Kahlo has her toes removed when they become [[gangrene|gangrenous]]. Rivera asks her to remarry him, and she agrees. Her health continues to worsen, including the amputation of a leg, and she ultimately dies after finally having a [[solo exhibition]] of her paintings in Mexico.

==Allusions==
The passengers in the bus Kahlo rides in that crashes with a streetcar are based on subjects in the painter's 1929 portrait, ''The Bus''. The [[Brothers Quay]]-created [[stop motion]] animation sequence depicting the initial stages of Kahlo's recovery at the hospital after the  accident are inspired by the Mexican holiday [[Day of the Dead]]. The gown [[Valeria Golino]] wears at Kahlo's 1953 Mexican solo art exhibition is a replica of the dress her character [[Lupe Marín]] wore in Rivera's 1938 portrait of her.

==Production==
[[File:Julie Taymor, Elliott Goldenthal, and Salma Hayek.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Director [[Julie Taymor]] with [[Elliot Goldenthal]] and [[Salma Hayek]].]]
The film version of [[Frida Kahlo]]'s life was initially championed by [[Nancy Hardin]], a former book editor and Hollywood-based literary agent, turned early "female studio executive", who, in the mid-1980s wished to "make the transition to independent producing."&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt; Learning of [[Hayden Herrara]]'s biography of Kahlo, Hardin saw Kahlo's life as very contemporary, her "story ... an emblematic tale for women torn between marriage and career."&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt; Optioning the book in 1988, Hardin "tried to sell it as an epic love story in the tradition of ''[[Out of Africa (film)|Out of Africa]]'', attracting tentative interest from actresses such as [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Jessica Lange]], but receiving rejection from the film studios. As Kahlo's art gained prominence, however "in May, 1990 one of Kahlo's self-portraits sold at Sotheby's for $1.5 million, the highest price ever paid at auction for a Latin American painting."&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt; [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] "announced her plans to star in a film based on Frida's life", and [[Robert De Niro]]'s [[Tribeca Productions]] reportedly "envisioned a joint biography of [[Diego Rivera|Rivera]] and Kahlo."&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt; In the spring of 1991, director [[Luis Valdez]] began production on a [[New Line]] feature about Frida Kahlo starring [[Laura San Giacomo]] in the lead. San Giacomo's casting received objections due to her non-[[Hispanic]] ethnicity, and New Line complied with the protesters' demands, and left the then-titled ''Frida and Diego'' in August, 1992 citing finances.&lt;ref name="Book LA"&gt;[http://thebookla.com/s_2000_hayek.html The Book LA SUMMER 2000 Selma &amp; Frida&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181511/http://thebookla.com/s_2000_hayek.html |date=2009-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardin's project found itself swamped by similar ones:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I first tried to sell the project ... there was no interest because nobody had heard of Frida. A few years later, I heard the exact opposite{{spaced ndash}}that there were too many Frida projects in development, and nobody wanted mine.&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Valdez was contacted early on by the{{spaced ndash}}then unknown in the U.S.{{spaced ndash}}Salma Hayek, who sent "her [promo] reel to the director and phoned his office", but was ultimately told she was then too young for the role.&lt;ref name="Writing"/&gt; By 1993, Valdez had retitled the film ''The Two Fridas'' with San Giacomo and [[Ofelia Medina]] both playing the portraitist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR106879.html?categoryid=19&amp;cs=1 Kahlo biopic gets new wakeup call{{spaced ndash}}Entertainment News, International News, Media{{spaced ndash}}Variety&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raúl Juliá]] was cast as Diego Rivera, but his death further delayed the movie. At the same time, Hardin approached [[HBO]], and with "rising young development executive and producer" Lizz Speed (a former assistant to [[Sherry Lansing]]) intended to make a [[television movie]], hopeful that [[Brian Gibson (director)|Brian Gibson]] (director of "''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do With It]]'', the story of [[Tina Turner]]" and ''The [[Josephine Baker]] Story'') would direct.&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt; Casting difficulties proved insurmountable, but Speed joined Hardin in advocating the project, and after four years in [[Filmmaking#Development|development]], the two took the project from HBO to [[Trimark]] and producer [[Jay Polstein]] (with assistant [[Darlene Caamaño]]). At Trimark, [[Salma Hayek]] became interested in the role, having "been fascinated by Kahlo's work from the time she was 13 or 14"{{spaced ndash}}although not immediately a fan:

{{quote|At that age I did not like her work ... I found it ugly and grotesque. But something intrigued me, and the more I learned, the more I started to appreciate her work. There was a lot of passion and depth. Some people see only pain, but I also see irony and humor. I think what draws me to her is what Diego saw in her. She was a fighter. Many things could have diminished her spirit, like the accident or Diego's infidelities. But she wasn't crushed by anything.&lt;ref name="Book LA"/&gt;}} 

Hayek was so determined to play the role that she sought out [[Dolores Olmedo|Dolores Olmedo Patino]], longtime-lover of Diego Rivera, and (after his death) administrator to the rights of Frida and Rivera's art, which Rivera had "willed ... to the Mexican people", bequeath[ing] the trust to Olmedo.&lt;ref name="Writing"/&gt; Salma Hayek personally secured access to Kahlo's paintings from her, and began to assemble a supporting cast, approaching Alfred Molina for the role of Rivera in 1998. According to Molina, "She turned up backstage [of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play ''[['Art']]''] rather sheepishly, and asked if I would like to play Diego". Molina went on to gain 35 pounds to play Rivera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/interview/interviewpages/0,,544397,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jo | last=Tuckman | title=That Frida feeling | date=August 30, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When producer Polstein left Trimark, however, the production faltered again, and Hayek approached [[Harvey Weinstein]] and [[Miramax]], and the company purchased the film from Trimark; [[Julie Taymor]] came onto the project as Director.

In a December 2017 [[op-ed]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Hayek stated that Weinstein attempted to thwart the making of the film because Hayek had refused to grant him sexual favors and also threatened to shut down the film unless Hayek agreed to include a full frontal nude sex scene with herself and another woman.&lt;ref name="harvey"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hayek|first1=Salma|title=Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/13/opinion/contributors/salma-hayek-harvey-weinstein.html|accessdate=13 December 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Weinstein claimed that none of the sexual allegations made by Hayek were accurate and that he did not recall pressuring Hayek "to do a gratuitous sex scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Moniuszko|first1=Sara M|title=Harvey Weinstein responds to Salma Hayek calling him her 'monster'|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/13/salma-hayek-harvey-weinstein-my-monster-too/948605001/|accessdate=14 December 2017|work=[[USA Today]]|date=December 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 75% of 153 critics have given the film a positive review, with a [[average|rating average]] of 6.9/10.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frida/|title=Firda (2002)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the site's summary of the critical consensus, "''Frida'' is a passionate, visually striking biopic about the larger-than-life artist."&lt;ref name="RT"/&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a score of 1–100 to individual film reviews, gives the film an average rating of 61 based on 38 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/frida|title=Frida|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stella Papamichael from the [[BBC]] gave the film three out of five stars and stated "Julie Taymor's biography of Mexican painter Frida Kahlo connects the dots between art and anguish. The disparity lies in the fact that Frida settles for tickling a fancy where it should be packing a punch. Although involving and sprightly, it offers the kind of guilty pleasure a Fine Arts student might derive from a glossy cartoon strip."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2003/02/11/frida_2003_review.shtml|title=Frida (2003)|last=Papamichael|first=Stella|date=February 24, 2003|work=BBC Movies|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] awarded ''Frida'' three and a half stars and commented "Sometimes we feel as if the film careens from one colorful event to another without respite, but sometimes it must have seemed to Frida Kahlo as if her life did, too."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021101/REVIEWS/211010302/1023|title=Frida|last=Ebert|first=Roger|date=November 1, 2002|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert thought Taymor and the writers had "obviously struggled with the material", though he called the closing scenes "extraordinary."&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'s'' Jonathan Foreman praised the score and Taymor's direction, saying that she "captures both the glamorous, deeply cosmopolitan milieu Kahlo and Rivera inhabited, and the importance Mexico had in the '30s for the international left."&lt;ref name="Foreman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/movies/49676.htm|title=Frida,' Ole!|last=Foreman|first=Jonathan|date=October 25, 2002|work=[[New York Post]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=November 11, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021130233950/http://www.nypost.com/movies/49676.htm|archivedate=November 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that the odd accents adopted by the likes of Judd and Rush let the authenticity down.&lt;ref name="Foreman"/&gt; Andrew Pulver from ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film three stars and proclaimed that it is "a substantial film, its story told with economy and clarity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/28/artsfeatures.drama|title=Frida|last=Pulver|first=Andrew|date=February 28, 2003|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=November 11, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===
{{Main|List of accolades received by Frida}}
The [[American Film Institute]] included ''Frida'' in their Movies of the Year 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afi.com/afiawards/AFIAwards02.aspx|title=AFI Movies Of The Year – Official Selections|publisher=[[American Film Institute]]|accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official Selection. Their rationale was:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Frida'' is a movie about art that is a work of art in itself. The film's unique visual language takes us into an artist's head and reminds us that art is best enjoyed when it moves, breathes and is painted on a giant canvas, as only the movies can provide.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Gerontissa Gavrielia''' (Elder Gabriela), also known as '''Mother Gavrielia'''&lt;ref name="In Communion"/&gt; (15 October 1897 – 28 March 1992) was a [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] nun, known for her care of the poor and sick. She was the second woman to be admitted to a Greek university and was a trained physiotherapist prior to taking up her religious calling at the age of 60.

She grew up in Constantinople and lived there until her family was deported during the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] and sent to [[Thessaloniki]]. She entered the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]], becoming the second woman ever admitted to a Greek university,&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; where she earned a degree in [[philosophy]]. She had previously graduated with a degree in [[botany]] at a Swiss university.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=23}} In 1932, she moved to Athens and cared for [[nursing home]] residents&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; until 1938 when she moved to England to study [[podiatry]] and [[physiotherapy]], where she remained until the end of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1945, Papayannis returned to Greece and began working with the [[American Farm School]] and [[Friends Relief Service]] in Thessaloniki,{{sfn|Marder|1979|p=215}}&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; until 1947, when she moved to Athens and opened a physiotherapy practice. For a decade she operated her office using funds from her paying clients to provide assistance to the poor. Upon the death of her mother, in 1954, she took a vow of poverty and gave all her worldly possessions away. The following year,&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; she moved to [[India]] to work with the poor and assist [[Baba Amte]] in his work with [[Leprosy|leper]] communities in India.&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki /&gt; After four years of providing free physiotherapy to the poor, Papayannis went to the [[Himalayan Mountains]], spending eleven months in solitude as a hermit.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; She then traveled to [[Landour]] where she met an American woman, who arranged for her to go to the monastery headed by Father Theodosius in [[Bethany]], in the [[Holy Land]] in 1960.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=25}} She arrived at the [[Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord]]{{#tag:ref|The Russian Orthodox archive account calls this monastery the "Monastery of Mary and Martha",&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; Brady calls it the "Monastery of St. Lazarus"&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; and the Orthodox Wiki calls it "the Monastery of Sts Mary and Martha in Bethany".&lt;ref name=OrthodoxWiki /&gt; The Greek Orthodox Church and St. Lazarus Monastery were not built until 1965.{{sfn|Murphy-O'Connor|2008|p=228}} According to the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission of Jerusalem, two British women, who became Orthodox tonsured nuns in 1932, took the religious names Mary and Martha. They organized a religious community in Bethany, called the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord. Soon after its founding, the church authorities moved the community to Gethsemane where they became attached to the [[Church of Mary Magdalene]]. Though its name officially remains the Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord, it is often identified as the Convent of Mary Magdalene.&lt;ref name="Russian Ecclesiastical Mission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bethany Community of the Resurrection of the Lord|url=http://www.jerusalem-mission.org/bethany.html|publisher=Russian Ecclesiastical Mission|accessdate=8 December 2015|location=Jerusalem, Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="notes"}} and after accepting [[tonsure]] became a nun. After her three-year [[novitiate]], Papayannis took the name Gavrielia.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt;

Sister Gavrielia was sent to the [[Taizé Community]] in France by the Patriarch [[Athenagoras I of Constantinople]], though her assignment there was brief. She was then sent to the United States, where she toured ethnic Greek communities in seventeen states and accompanied many mentally ill patients to psychiatric hospitals in Europe.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} After nearly a decade of touring, speaking, and helping the sick, she was sent to East Africa for three years to do missionary work.&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; Following a brief assignment in Germany, Sister Gavrielia was sent back to India,{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} where she remained for three years. In 1979, she was given use of an Athens apartment and became a "Gerontissa" (elder), counseling disciples and helping the sick over the next ten years. Near the end of her life, she retreated to a hermitage in [[Aegina]],&lt;ref name="In Communion" /&gt; but when she developed [[Hodgkin's disease]] she returned to Athens. After a miraculous healing, she left Athens two years before her death and moved to the island of [[Leros]].{{sfn|Karellos|2001|pp=25–26}} Gerontissa Gavrielia died on Leros on 28 March, 1992.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 1996 a biography of her life entitled ''I Askitiki tis Agapis'' was published in Greek,&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; in 1999 the book was translated into English,{{sfn|Nun Gavrilia|1999|p=}} and in 2000 into Russian.&lt;ref name="Russian Orthodox archive" /&gt; It has since had 14 Greek editions, 2 English editions, and has been translated into Arabic, French and Serbian.{{sfn|Karellos|2001|p=21}}

'''"Granada"''' is a song written in 1932 by Mexican composer [[Agustín Lara]]. The song is about the Spanish city of [[Granada]] and has become a [[pop standard|standard]] in music repertoire.

The most popular versions are the original with Spanish lyrics by Lara (often sung [[opera]]tically); a version with English lyrics by [[Australian]] [[lyricist]] [[Dorothy Dodd]]; and [[instrumental]] versions in jazz, pop, [[easy listening]], [[flamenco]] or rock styles. Other versions in English also exist (one with lyrics by [[Al Stewart]], and one with lyrics by [[Robert Musel]] and Edward Lisbona) but these are less common. An Italian version was written in 1954 by [[Enzo Luigi Poletto]]. There are also versions in [[German language|German]] and other languages.

The song has been [[cover version|covered]] many times. It is [[Jose Carreras]]'s personal signature tune.&lt;ref&gt;http://arthaus-musik.com/en/dvd/a-z/media/details/Jose_Carreras_Collection_1.html&lt;/ref&gt; Popular versions include those by Alan Seager and his musical family, [[Placido Domingo]], [[Frankie Laine]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Juan Arvizu]], [[Nestor Mesta Chayres]], [[Mario Lanza]], [[Pasquale Esposito]], [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]]. It has been sung in Italian by [[Claudio Villa (singer)|Claudio Villa]], and in German by [[Fritz Wunderlich]] and Spanish pop-duo [[Baccara]].

The song was much favoured by theatre organists in the UK, because it provided an opportunity for showing off the organ's tuned (harp, glockenspiel, etc.) and non-tuned (castanets, tambourine) percussion.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Because of the flamboyant nature of the tune, and the Spanish lyrics, "Granada" has been accepted by college music courses as an "[[art song]]."{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Lyrics==
'''Lara's opening lyrics are:'''&lt;br&gt;''Granada tierra soñada por mí.''&lt;br&gt;''Mi cantar se vuelve gitano cuando es para ti.''

'''Dodd's version begins thus:'''&lt;br&gt;''Granada, I'm falling under your spell,''&lt;br&gt;''And if you could speak, what a fascinating tale you would tell.''

[[File:Grevensvaenge Schnabel.jpg|thumb|1779 drawing by Marcus Schnabel]]
The '''Grevensvænge hoard''' is a find of the late [[Nordic Bronze Age]] (roughly dating to between 800 BC and 500 BC), discovered in the late 18th century at Grevensvænge, [[Næstved Municipality]], [[Zealand]], [[Denmark]].
The hoard consisted of seven bronze figurines. Its first mention is in 1779, where it is said to have been found in the ground "a few years ago". After their discovery, they were kept with the pastor at [[Herlufmagle]], Marcus Schnabel.

A drawing of four of the figurines was made in 1779, by Schnabel. The drawing shows two kneeling figures of warriors with [[horned helmet]]s and axes, a leaping acrobat, and a standing woman. Five of these figurines are now lost, while two were bought by the [[Danish National Museum]] in 1823 and 1839. 

Based on comparison with [[petroglyphs]] of the same era (e.g. [[Tanumshede]], Sweden), it is assumed that the figurines were originally part of an ensemble arranged on a ship.

Both the twins motive and the cultic significance of the horned helmets, seems to have persisted into [[pre-Roman Iron Age|early Germanic culture]]. The kneeling warrior figures have been interpreted as the "[[Ashvins]]" type [[divine twins]] of early Indo-European religion, sons of the sky-god, known by the name of [[Alcis (gods)|Alcis]] to Tacitus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31702">{{Dome architecture}}
'''Persian domes''' or '''Iranian domes''' have an ancient origin and a history extending to the modern era. The use of domes in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] was carried forward through a succession of empires in the [[Greater Iran|Greater Persia]] region. 

An ancient tradition of royal audience tents representing the heavens was translated into monumental stone and brick domes due to the invention of the [[squinch]], a reliable method of supporting the circular base of a heavy dome upon the walls of a square chamber. Domes were built as part of royal palaces, castles, caravansaries, and temples, among other structures. 

With the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|introduction of Islam in the 7th century]], mosque and mausoleum architecture also adopted and developed these forms. Structural innovations included pointed domes, drums, conical roofs, double and triple shells, and the use of [[muqarnas]] and bulbous forms. Decorative brick patterning, interlaced ribs, painted plaster, and colorful tiled mosaics were used to decorate the exterior as well as the interior surfaces.

== Overview ==

Persian domes from different historical eras can be distinguished by their transition tiers: the squinches, spandrels, or brackets that transition from the supporting structures to the circular base of a dome. Drums, after the Ilkanate era, tend to be very similar and have an average height of 30 to 35 meters from the ground. They are where windows are located. Inner shells are commonly semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, or saucer shaped. The outer shell of a Persian dome reduces in thickness every 25 or 30 degrees from the base. Outer shells can be semi-circular, semi-elliptical, pointed, conical, or bulbous, and this outer shape is used to categorize them. Pointed domes can be sub-categorized as having shallow, medium, and sharp profiles, and bulbous domes as either shallow or sharp. Double domes use internal stiffeners with wooden struts between the shells, with the exception of those with conical outer shells. {{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=111–113}}

== Pre-Islamic period ==

[[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] likely inherited an architectural tradition of dome-building dating back to the earliest Mesopotamian domes.{{sfn|Spiers|1911|p=957}} Due to the scarcity of wood in many areas of the [[Iranian plateau]], domes were an important part of [[vernacular architecture]] throughout Persian history.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

=== Achaemenid Empire ===
Although they had palaces of brick and stone, the kings of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persia]] held audiences and festivals in domical tents derived from the nomadic traditions of central Asia. They were likely similar to the [[Yurt|later tents]] of the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol Khans]]. Called "Heavens", these tents emphasized the cosmic significance of the divine ruler. They were adopted by [[Alexander the Great]] after his conquest of the empire, and the domed [[baldachin]] of Roman and Byzantine practice was presumably inspired by this association.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=81–82}}

=== Parthian Empire ===
The remains of a large domed circular hall measuring 17 meters in diameter in the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] capital city of [[Nisa, Turkmenistan|Nyssa]] has been dated to perhaps the first century AD. It "shows the existence of a monumental domical tradition in Central Asia that had hitherto been unknown and which seems to have preceded Roman Imperial monuments or at least to have grown independently from them."{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192}} It likely had a wooden dome.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=99}}

The Sun Temple at [[Hatra]] appears to indicate a transition from columned halls with [[trabeated]] roofing to vaulted and domed construction in the first century AD, at least in Mesopotamia. The domed sanctuary hall of the temple was preceded by a barrel vaulted [[iwan]], a combination that would be used by the subsequent Persian [[Sasanian Empire]].{{sfn|Stronach|1976|p=623}}

An account of a Parthian domed palace hall from around 100 AD in the city of Babylon can be found in the ''[[Life of Apollonius of Tyana]]'' by [[Philostratus]]. The hall was used by the king for passing judgments and was decorated with a mosaic of blue stone to resemble the sky, with images of gods in gold.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=250–251}}

A bulbous Parthian dome can be seen in the relief sculpture of the [[Arch of Septimius Severus]] in Rome, its shape apparently due to the use of a light tent-like framework.{{sfn|Smith|1950|p=82}}

=== Sasanian Empire ===
[[File:Sarvestan Palace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Ruins of the [[Sarvestan Palace]] in Sarvestan, Iran.]]
[[Caravanserai|Caravansaries]] used the domed bay from the Sasanian period to the [[Qajar dynasty]].{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The Persian invention of the [[squinch]], a series of concentric arches forming a half-cone over the corner of a room, enabled the transition from the walls of a square chamber to an octagonal base for a dome. Previous transitions to a dome from a square chamber existed but were makeshift in quality and only attempted on a small scale, not being reliable enough for large constructions. The squinch enabled domes to be widely used and they moved to the forefront of Persian architecture as a result.{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=148}} 

The ruins of the [[Palace of Ardashir]] and [[Ghal'eh Dokhtar]] in [[Fars Province]], Iran, built by [[Ardashir I]] (224&amp;ndash;240) of the Sasanian Empire, have the earliest known examples of squinches.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The three domes of the Palace of Ardashir are 45 feet in diameter and vertically elliptical, each with a central opening or oculus to admit light.{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=149}} They were built with local stone and mortar and covered with plaster on the interior.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=101}} At the center of the palace of Shahpur, at Bishapur, there is a vertically-elliptical dome that rests directly on the ground and is dated to 260.{{sfn|Melaragno|1991|p=25}} The large brick dome of the [[Sarvestan Palace]], also in Fars but later in date, shows more elaborate decoration and four windows between the corner squinches. Also called "the Temple of Anahita", the building may have been a [[Fire temple]].{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=101}}{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} Instead of using a central oculus in each dome, as at the Palace of Ardashir and as shown in the bas relief found at Kuyunjik, lighting was provided by a number of hollow [[terracotta]] cylinders set into the domes at regular intervals.{{sfn|Creswell|1915a|p=150}} 

Multiple written accounts from Arabic, Byzantine, and Western medieval sources describe a palace domed structure over the throne of [[Khosrau I|Chosroes]] decorated in [[Lapis lazuli|blue]] and gold. The dome was covered with depictions of the sun, moon, stars, planets, the [[zodiac]], astrapai, and kings, including Chosroes himself. According to [[Ado (bishop)|Ado]] and others, the dome could produce rain, and could be rotated with a sound like thunder by means of ropes pulled by horses in a basement.{{sfn|Lehmann|1945|p=253}} The castle of [[Qasr-e Shirin]] had a domed chamber at the end of a long barrel-vaulted iwan. The late-Sasanian [[Taq Kasra|Tāq-i Kasrā]] in [[Ctesiphon]] may also have led to a domed throne room.{{sfn|Swoboda|1961|p=85}}

[[File:ChaharTaqi-KheirAbad-3.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Ruins of a chahar-taqi in Iran.]]
[[Chahartaq (architecture)|''Chahar-taqi'']], or "four vaults", were smaller [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] fire temple structures with four supports arranged in a square, connected by four arches, and covered by central ovoid domes. The [[Neyasar|Niasar]] Zoroastrian temple in [[Kashan]] and the ''chahar-taqi'' in [[Darreh Shahr]] are examples.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=100}} Such temples, square domed buildings with entrances at the axes, inspired the forms of early mosques after [[Muslim conquest of Persia|the Islamic conquest of the empire]] in the 7th century.{{sfn|Stephenson|Hammond|Davi|2005|p=162}} These domes are the most numerous surviving type from the Sasanian period, with some having been converted into mosques. The later isolated dome chambers called the "kiosk mosque" type may have developed from this.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} Pre-Islamic domes in Persia are commonly semi-elliptical, with pointed domes and those with conical outer shells being the majority of the domes in the Islamic periods.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=113}}

Although the Sasanians did not create monumental tombs, the domed chahar-taqi may have served as memorials. A [[Sogdian language|Soghdian]] painting fragment from the early eighth century found at [[Panjakent]] appears to depict a funerary dome (possibly a tent) and this, along with a few [[Ossuary|ossuaries]] of an architectural nature, indicates a possible tradition in central Asia of a funerary association with the domed form. The area of north-eastern Iran was, along with Egypt, one of two areas notable for early developments in Islamic domed mausoleums, which appear in the tenth century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=192–194}}

== Islamic period ==

=== Early Islamic period ===
[[File:Bukhara Samanid mausoleum inside.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Samanid Mausoleum]] in Bukhara, Uzbekistan.]]
The earliest known Islamic domes in Persia, such as the Great Mosque of [[Qom]] (878) and the tomb of [[Banū Mūsā|Muhammed b. Musa]] (976), seem to have continued the rounded Sasanian form.{{sfn|Creswell|1915|p=208}} Domed mausoleums contributed greatly to the development and spread of the dome in Persia early in the Islamic period. By the 10th century, domed tombs had been built for [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphs]] and [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] martyrs. [[Pilgrimage]] to these sites may have helped to spread the form.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

The earliest surviving example, the Qubbat-al Sulaibiya, was an octagonal structure with a central dome on a drum built around 892 in [[Samarra]].{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1942}} Free-standing domed pavilions are known from [[Shiraz]] and [[Bukhara]] in the tenth century.{{sfn|Grabar|1963|p=197}} The [[Samanid Mausoleum]] in [[Transoxiana]] dates to no later than 943 and is the first to have squinches create a regular octagon as a base for the dome, which then became the standard practice. The [[Arab-Ata Mausoleum]], also in Transoxiana, may be dated to 977&amp;ndash;78 and uses [[muqarnas]] between the squinches for a more unified transition to the dome. Cylindrical or polygonal plan tower tombs with conical roofs over domes also exist beginning in the 11th century.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The earliest example is the [[Gonbad-e Qabus (tower)|Gonbad-e Qabus tower tomb]], 57 meters high and spanning 9.7 meters, which was built in 1007.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=103}}{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1942}}

=== Seljuq dynasty ===
[[File:Gran Mezquita de Isfahán, Isfahán, Irán, 2016-09-20, DD 43-45 HDR.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan|Jameh Mosque]] in Isfahan, Iran.]]
The [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] built tower tombs, called "Turkish Triangles", as well as cube mausoleums covered with a variety of dome forms. Seljuk domes included conical, semi-circular, and pointed shapes in one or two shells. Shallow semi-circular domes are mainly found from the Seljuk era. The double-shell domes were either discontinuous or continuous. The continuous double-shell domes separated from one another at an angle of 22.5 degrees from their base, such as the dome of the Friday mosque in [[Ardestan]], whereas the discontinuous domes remained completely separate, such as those of the tower tombs of Kharrqan.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102, 104, 105, 113}} This [[Kharraqan towers|pair of brick tower tombs]] from the 11th century in Kharraqan, Iran, are the earliest known masonry double shell domes. The domes may have been modeled on earlier wooden double shell domes, such as that of the [[Dome of the Rock]]. It is also possible, because the upper portions of both of the outer shells are missing, that some portion of the outer domes may have been wooden.{{sfn|Mainstone|2001|p=124}} These brick mausoleum domes were built without the use of centering, a technique developed in Persia.{{sfn|Gentry|Lesniewski|2011|p=}}

The [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq Empire]] introduced the domed enclosure in front of the mosque's [[mihrab]], which would become popular in Persian [[Jama Masjid|congregational mosques]], although domed rooms may have also been used earlier in small neighborhood mosques. The domed enclosure of the [[Jameh Mosque of Isfahan]], built in 1086-7 by [[Nizam al-Mulk]], was the largest masonry dome in the Islamic world at that time, had eight ribs, and introduced a new form of corner squinch with two quarter domes supporting a short barrel vault. In 1088 Tāj-al-Molk, a rival of Nizam al-Mulk, built another dome at the opposite end of the same mosque with interlacing ribs forming five-pointed stars and pentagons. This is considered the landmark Seljuk dome, and may have inspired subsequent patterning and the domes of the Il-Khanate period. The use of tile and of plain or painted plaster to decorate dome interiors, rather than brick, increased under the Seljuks.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} One of the largest Seljuq domes, built over the site of a Sassanian Fire Temple, was that of the [[Jameh Mosque of Qazvin]] with a span of 15.2 meters.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102}} The largest Seljuq domed chamber was the [[Tomb of Ahmed Sanjar]], which had a large double shell, intersecting ribs over plain squinches, and an exterior elaborately decorated at the zone of transition with arches and stucco work.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The tomb of Sultan Sanjar, who reigned from 1117 to 1157, was damaged in the sack of [[Merv]] in 1221 by [[Tolui|Tolui Khan]].{{sfn|Creswell|1915|p=208}}

=== The Ilkhanate ===
[[File:Solt dome 1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The [[Soltaniyeh#Dome of Soltaniyeh|Mausoleum of Öljaitü]] in Soltaniyeh, Iran.]]
After the disruptive effects of several [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|Mongol invasions]], Persian architecture again flourished in the [[Ilkhanate]] and [[Islamic architecture#Turkistan (Timurid) architecture|Timurid]] periods. Characteristic of these domes are the use of high drums and several types of discontinuous double-shells, and the development of triple-shells and internal stiffeners occurred at this time. Beginning in the Ilkanate, Persian domes achieved their final configuration of structural supports, zone of transition, drum, and shells, and subsequent evolution was restricted to variations in form and shell geometry. The construction of tomb towers decreased.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=105, 110}}

The two major domes of the IlKhanate period are the no-longer-existing mausoleum of [[Ghazan]] in [[Tabriz]] and the [[Dome of Soltaniyeh|Mausoleum of Öljaitü]] in [[Soltaniyeh]], the latter having been built to rival the former.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} Öljaitü was the first sovereign of Persia to declare himself of the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] sect of Islam and built the mausoleum, with the largest Persian dome, to house the bodies of [[Ali]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]] as a pilgrimage site. This did not occur and it became his own mausoleum instead.{{sfn|Creswell|1915|p=208, 211}} The dome measures 50 meters high and almost 25 meters in diameter and has the best surviving tile and stucco work from this period. The thin, double-shelled dome was reinforced by arches between the layers.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}
[[File:Dome interior of Jameh Mosque in Varamin.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Dome of [[Jameh Mosque of Varamin]], Iran]]
Tower tombs of this period, such as the tomb of [[Abdas-Samad Esfahani]] in [[Natanz]], sometimes have muqarnas domes, although they are usually plaster shells that hide the underlying structures. The tall proportions of the [[Jameh Mosque of Varamin]] resulted primarily from the increased height of the zone of transition, with the addition of a sixteen-sided section above the main zone of muqarnas squinches.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The 7.5 meter wide double dome of [[Soltan Bakht Agha Mausoleum]] (1351–1352) is the earliest known example in which the two shells of the dome have significantly different profiles, which spread rapidly throughout the region. The inner and outer shells had radial stiffeners and struts between them.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=106}} An early example of a dome chamber almost completely covered with decorative tilework is that of the [[Jame Mosque of Yazd]] (1364), as well as several of the mausoleums of [[Shah-i-Zinda]] in [[Samarkand]]. The development of taller drums also continued into the Timurid period.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

=== Timurid dynasty ===
At the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] capital of Samarkand, nobles and rulers in the 14th and 15th centuries began building tombs with double-shelled domes containing cylindrical masonry drums between the shells. In the [[Gur-e Amir]], built by [[Timur]] around 1404, a timber framework on the inner dome supports the outer, bulbous dome. Radial tie-bars at the base of the bulbous dome provide additional structural support. Timber reinforcement rings and rings of stone linked by iron cramps were also used to compensate for the structural problems introduced by using such drums.{{sfn|Tappin|2003|p=1942–1943}} Radial sections of brick walls with wooden struts were used between the shells of discontinuous double domes to provide structural stability as late at the 14th century.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=112}}

[[File:Turk22.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi]] in Turkistan, Kazakhstan.]]
A [[Persian miniature|miniature]] painted at Samarkand shows that bulbous cupolas were used to cover small wooden pavilions in Persia by the beginning of the fifteenth century. They gradually gained in popularity.{{sfn|Born|1944|p=208}} The large, bulbous, fluted domes on tall drums that are characteristic of 15th century Timurid architecture were the culmination of the Central Asian and Iranian tradition of tall domes with glazed tile coverings in blue and other colors.{{sfn|Peterson|1996|p=68}} The [[Mausoleum of Khoja Ahmed Yasawi]], situated in southern [[Kazakhstan]] was never finished, but has the [[List of largest domes in the world#Famous large domes|largest existing brick dome in Central Asia]], measuring 18.2&amp;nbsp;m in diameter. The dome exterior is covered with hexagonal green glazed tiles with gold patterns.{{sfn|natcom}}

Mausoleums were rarely built as free-standing structures after the 14th century, being instead often attached to madrasas in pairs. Domes of these madrasas, such as those of the madrasa of [[Goharshad]] (1417–1433) and the madrasa at Ḵargerd (1436–1443), had dramatically innovative interiors. They used intersecting arches to support an inner dome narrower than the floor below, a change that may have originated with the 14th century use of small lantern domes over transverse vaulting. The madrasa of Goharshad is also the first triple-shell dome. The middle dome may have been added as reinforcement.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} Triple-shelled domes are rare outside of the Timurid era. The dome of the [[Amir Chakhmaq Complex|Amir Chakhmaq mosque]] (1437) has a semi-circular inner shell and an advanced system of stiffeners and wooden struts supporting a shallow pointed outer shell. Notably, the dome has a circular drum with two tiers. Another double shell dome from the early Seljuq period at the shrine complex of [[Bayazid Bastami]] was changed in the Timurid period by the addition of a third conical shell over the existing two domed shells.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=107–108, 114}}

The [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] architecture of the region around [[Transoxiana]] maintained the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] style of dome-building. Where dome chambers were surrounded by axial iwans and corner rooms on an octagonal plan, as at the [[Khwaja Abu Nasr Parsa shrine]] (ca. 1598), they provided the model for Indian mausoleums such as [[Humayun's Tomb]] in [[Delhi]] or the [[Taj Mahal]]. Some of the earliest surviving domed markets, called ''tīmcās'', can be found in [[Khanate of Bukhara#Shaybanid Dynasty|Shaybanid-era Bukhara]].{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

=== Safavid dynasty ===
[[File:Sheikh Lotf Allah Mosque interior ceiling dome Esfahan.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque]] in Isfahan, Iran.]]
The domes of the [[Safavid dynasty]] (1501–1732) are characterized by a distinctive bulbous profile and are considered to be the last generation of Persian domes. They are generally thinner than earlier domes and are decorated with a variety of colored glazed tiles and complex vegetal patterns.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=102, 108–109}} The dome of the [[Blue Mosque, Tabriz|Blue Mosque in Tabriz]] (1465) had its interior covered with "dark-blue hexagonal tiles with stenciled gilding".{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The palace of [[Ālī Qāpū]] includes small domed rooms decorated with artificial vegetation.{{sfn|Grabar|1990|p=19}}

The dome of [[Sheikh Lotfollah Mosque]] in [[Isfahan]] (1603–1618), perhaps "the quintessential Persian dome chamber", blends the square room with the zone of transition and uses plain squinches like those of the earlier Seljuq period. On the exterior, multiple levels of glazed [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] are blended with an unglazed brick background. The domes of the [[Imam Mosque Isfahan|Shah Mosque]] (later renamed the Imam Mosque) and the [[Chaharbagh School|Mādar-e Šāh madrasa]] have a similar exterior pattern against a background of light blue glazed tile.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}} The bulbous dome of the Shah Mosque was built from 1611 to 1638 and is a discontinuous double-shell 33 meters wide and 52 meters high. The oldest example of the Safavid onion dome is over the octagonal mausoleum of Khwaja Rabi (1617–1622). Safavid domes were influential on those of other Islamic styles, such as the [[History of South Asian and Mughal domes|Mughal architecture]] of India.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=109}}

=== Qajar dynasty ===
[[File:Timche-ye-Qom4.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Domes in the bazaar of [[Qom]], Iran]]
In the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]] (1779–1924), the movement to modern architecture meant less innovation in dome construction. Domes were built over madrasas, such as the 1848 Imam madrasa, or Sultani school, of [[Kashan]], but they have relatively simple appearances and do not use tiled mosaics.{{sfn|Ashkan|Ahmad|2009|p=109}} The covered markets or bazaars (''tīmcās'') at Qom and [[Bazaar of Kashan|Kashan]] feature a central dome with smaller domes on either side and elaborate [[muqarnas]]. An exaggerated style of onion dome on a short drum, as can be seen at the [[Shah Cheragh]] (1852–1853), first appeared in the Qajar period. Domes have remained important in modern mausoleums, such as the tombs of [[Tomb of Hafez|Ḥāfeẓ]], [[Tomb of Saadi|Saʿdī]], [[Reza Shah's mausoleum|Reza Shah]], and [[Mausoleum of Khomeini|Ruhollah Khomeini]] in the twentieth century. Domed [[Ab anbar|cisterns]] and [[Yakhchal|icehouses]] remain common sights in the countryside.{{sfn|O'Kane|1995}}

'''Homer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|oʊ|m|ər}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ὅμηρος}} {{IPA-el|hómɛːros}}, ''Hómēros'') is the legendary author of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', two epic poems that are the central works of [[ancient Greek literature]]. The ''Iliad'' is set during the [[Trojan War]], the ten-year siege of the city of [[Troy]] by a coalition of Greek kingdoms. It focuses on a quarrel between King [[Agamemnon]] and the warrior [[Achilles]] lasting a few weeks during the last year of the war. The ''Odyssey'' focuses on the journey home of [[Odysseus]], king of Ithaca, around 20 years after the fall of Troy. Many [[ancient accounts of Homer|accounts of Homer's life]] circulated in [[classical antiquity]], the most widespread being that he was a blind [[bard]] from [[Ionia]], a region of central coastal [[Anatolia]] in present-day [[Turkey]]. Modern scholars consider them legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Nigel|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136788000|pages=366|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8pXhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA366|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=en|date=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Romilly|first1=Jacqueline de|title=A Short History of Greek Literature|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226143125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y_DTllltXBQC&amp;pg=PA1|pages=1|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=en|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bgr&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521809665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC&amp;pg=PA15|pages=15|accessdate=22 November 2016|language=en|date=2002-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Homeric Question]]—concerning by whom, when, where and under what circumstances the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' were composed—continues to be debated. Broadly speaking, modern scholarly opinion falls into two groups. One holds that most of the ''Iliad'' and (according to some) the ''Odyssey'' are the works of a single poet of genius. The other considers the Homeric poems to be the result of a process of working and reworking by many contributors, and that "Homer" is best seen as a label for an entire tradition.&lt;ref name="bgr" /&gt; It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Croally|first1=Neil|last2=Hyde|first2=Roy|title=Classical Literature: An Introduction|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136736629|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g-arAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=23 November 2016|language=en|date=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poems are in [[Homeric Greek]], also known as Epic Greek, a [[literary language]] which shows a mixture of features of the [[Ionic Greek|Ionic]] and [[Aeolic Greek|Aeolic]] dialects from different centuries; the predominant influence is Eastern Ionic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hose|first1=Martin|last2=Schenker|first2=David|title=A Companion to Greek Literature|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118885956|page=445|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DgBSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA445|language=en|date=2015-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=D.

Today only the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey'' are associated with the name 'Homer'. In antiquity, a very large number of other works were sometimes attributed to him, including the ''[[Homeric Hymns]]'', the ''[[Contest of Homer and Hesiod]]'', the ''[[Little Iliad]]'', the ''[[Nostoi]]'', the ''[[Thebaid (Greek poem)|Thebaid]]'', the ''[[Cypria]]'', the ''[[Epigoni (epic)|Epigoni]]'', the comic mini-epic ''[[Batrachomyomachia]]'' ("The Frog-Mouse War"), the ''[[Margites]]'', the ''[[Capture of Oechalia]]'', and the ''[[Phocais]]''. These claims are not considered authentic today and were by no means universally accepted in the ancient world. As with the multitude of legends surrounding Homer's life, they indicate little more than the centrality of Homer to ancient Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kelly|first1=Adrian D.|title=Homerica|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0606|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|last2=Haubold|first2=Johannes|title=Homer: The Resonance of Epic|date=2005|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780715632826|pages=24–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiDUAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521809665|pages=165–168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient biographies of Homer ==

{{details|Ancient accounts of Homer}}

Many traditions circulated in the ancient world concerning Homer, most of which are lost. Modern scholarly consensus is that they have no value as history. 

Some claims were established early and repeated often. They include that Homer was blind (taking as self-referential a passage describing the blind bard [[Demodocus (Odyssey character)|Demodocus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graziosi|first1=Barbara|title=Inventing Homer: The Early Reception of Epic|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521809665|pages=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vCHsh9QWzLYC&amp;pg=PA138|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odyssey, 8:64ff.&lt;/ref&gt;), that he was born in [[Chios]], that he was the son of the [[river Meles]] and the nymph [[Critheïs]], that he was a wandering bard, that he composed a varying list of other works (the "Homerica"), that he died either in [[Ios (island)|Ios]] or after failing to solve a riddle set by fishermen, and various explanations for the name "Homer".

"'Homer" is a name of unknown etymological origin, around which many theories were erected in antiquity. One such linkage was to the Greek {{lang|grc|ὅμηρος}} (''hómēros''), "hostage" (or "surety").

{{Main|Historicity of the Homeric epics}}

Scholars continue to debate questions such as whether the Trojan War actually took place — and if so when and where — and to what extent the society depicted by Homer is based on his own or one which was, even at the time of the poems' composition, known only as legend. The Homeric epics are largely set in the east and center of the [[Mediterranean]], with some scattered references to [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]] and other distant lands, in a warlike society that resembles that of the Greek world slightly before the hypothesized date of the poems' composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Raaflaub|first1=Kurt A.|title=Historicity of Homer|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0601|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Finley|first1=Moses I.|title=The World of Odysseus|date=1991|publisher=Penguin|isbn=9780140136869|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yaeBPwAACAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wees|first1=Hans van|title=War and Violence in Ancient Greece|date=2009|publisher=ISD LLC|isbn=9781910589298|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PtODgAAQBAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Ian|title=The Use and Abuse of Homer|journal=Classical Antiquity|date=1986|volume=5|issue=1|pages=81–138|doi=10.2307/25010840|jstor=25010840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greek chronology, the sack of Troy was dated to 1184 BC. By the nineteenth century, there was widespread scholarly skepticism that Troy or the Trojan War had ever existed, but in 1873 [[Heinrich Schliemann]] announced to the world that he had discovered the ruins of Homer's Troy at [[Hissarlik]] in modern [[Turkey]]. Some contemporary scholars think the destruction of Troy VIIa ''circa'' 1220 BC was the origin of the myth of the Trojan War, others that the poem was inspired by multiple similar sieges that took place over the centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dowden|first1=Ken|last2=Livingstone|first2=Niall|title=A Companion to Greek Mythology|date=2011|page=440|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444396935|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_XsN0O_BQ0cC&amp;pg=PA440|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars now agree that the Homeric poems depict customs and elements of the material world that are derived from different periods of Greek history.&lt;ref name="Taplin1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SacksMurrayBrody2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sacks|first1=David|last2=Murray|first2=Oswyn|last3=Brody|first3=Lisa R.|title=Encyclopedia of the Ancient Greek World|date=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438110202|pages=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yyrao0dadqAC&amp;pg=PA356|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MorrisPowell1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Ian|last2=Powell|first2=Barry B.|title=A New Companion to Homer|date=1997|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004217607|pages=434–435|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYAtDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA434|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the heroes in the poems use bronze weapons, characteristic of the [[Bronze Age]] in which the poems are set, rather than the later [[Iron Age]] during which they were composed;&lt;ref name="Taplin1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SacksMurrayBrody2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MorrisPowell1997"/&gt; yet the same heroes are cremated (an Iron Age practice) rather than buried (as they were in the Bronze Age).&lt;ref name="Taplin1986"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SacksMurrayBrody2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MorrisPowell1997"/&gt; In some parts of the Homeric poems, heroes are accurately described as carrying large shields like those used by warriors during the Mycenaean period,&lt;ref name="Taplin1986"/&gt; but, in other places, they are instead described carrying the smaller shields that were commonly used during the time when the poems were written in the early Iron Age.&lt;ref name="Taplin1986"/&gt;

In the ''Iliad'' 10.260-265, Odysseus is described as wearing a [[Boar's tusk helmet|helmet made of boar's tusks]]. Such helmets were not worn in Homer's time, but were commonly worn by aristocratic warriors between 1600 and 1150 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wood|first1=Michael|title=In Search of the Trojan War|date=1996|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=978-0-520-21599-3|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N5HDjtGwYjsC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;q=boar's%20tusk%20helmet|accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schofield|first1=Louise|title=The Mycenaeans|date=2007|publisher=The J.

== Homeric language ==
{{Main|Homeric Greek}}
[[File:Cropped image of Homer from Raphael's Parnassus.jpg|thumb|Detail of ''[[The Parnassus]]'' (painted 1509-1510) by [[Raphael]], depicting Homer wearing a crown of laurels atop [[Mount Parnassus]], with [[Dante Alighieri]] on his right and [[Virgil]] on his left]]
The Homeric epics are written in an artificial [[literary language]] or 'Kunstsprache' only used in epic [[hexameter]] poetry. Homeric Greek shows features of multiple regional Greek dialects and periods, but is fundamentally based on [[Ionic Greek]], in keeping with the tradition that Homer was from Ionia. Linguistic analysis suggests that the ''Iliad'' was composed slightly before the ''Odyssey'', and that Homeric formulae preserve older features than other parts of the poems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Willi|first1=Andreas|title=Language, Homeric|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0792|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bakker|first1=Egbert J.|title=A Companion to the Ancient Greek Language|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781444317404|pages=401|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oa42E3DP3icC&amp;pg=PA401|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homeric style ==

The Homeric poems were composed in unrhymed [[dactylic hexameter]]; ancient Greek [[metre (poetry)|metre]] was quantity rather than stress-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=W. Edwards|first1=Mark|title=Meter|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0913|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nussbaum|first1=G. B.|title=Homer's Metre: A Practical Guide for Reading Greek Hexameter Poetry|date=1986|publisher=Bristol Classical Press|isbn=9780862921729|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUMlAAAAMAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homer frequently uses set phrases such as [[Epithets in Homer|epithets]] ('crafty [[Odysseus]]', 'rosy-fingered [[Eos|Dawn]]', 'owl-eyed [[Athena]]', etc.), Homeric formulae ('and then answered [him/her], Agamemnon, king of men', 'when the early-born rose-fingered Dawn came to light', 'thus he/she spoke'), [[Homeric simile|simile]], type scenes, ring composition and repetition. These habits aid the extemporizing bard, and are characteristic of oral poetry. For instance, the main words of a Homeric sentence are generally placed towards the beginning, whereas literate poets like [[Virgil]] or [[John Milton|Milton]] use longer and more complicated syntactical structures. Homer then expands on these ideas in subsequent clauses; this technique is called [[parataxis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Mark W.|title=Style|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1377|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called '[[type scene]]s' (''typischen Scenen''), were named by [[Walter Arend]] in 1933. He noted that Homer often, when describing frequently recurring activities such as eating, praying, fighting and dressing, used blocks of set phrases in sequence that were then elaborated by the poet. The 'Analyst' school had considered these repetitions as un-Homeric, whereas Arend interpreted them philosophically. Parry and Lord noted that these conventions are found in many other cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Reece|first1=Steve T.|title=Type-Scenes|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1488|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edwards|first1=MW|title=Homer and Oral Tradition: The Type-Scene|journal=Oral Tradition|date=1992|volume=7|pages=284–330|url=http://www.citeulike.org/group/5373/article/4187736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Ring composition' or [[chiastic structure]] (when a phrase or idea is repeated at both the beginning and end of a story, or a series of such ideas first appears in the order A, B, C... before being reversed as ...C, B, A) has been observed in the Homeric epics. Opinion differs as to whether these occurrences are a conscious artistic device, a mnemonic aid or a spontaneous feature of human storytelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanley|first1=Keith|title=The Shield of Homer: Narrative Structure in the Illiad|date=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400863372|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz8ABAAAQBAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Minchin|first1=Elizabeth|title=Ring Composition|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1287|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of the Homeric poems begin with an invocation to the [[Muse]].&lt;ref name="Adler2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adler|first1=Eve|title=Vergil's Empire: Political Thought in the Aeneid|date=2003|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-7425-2167-4|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gbUaAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;q=Homer's%20Muse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Iliad'', the poet invokes her to sing of "the anger of Achilles",&lt;ref name="Adler2003"/&gt; and, in the ''Odyssey'', he asks her to sing of "the man of many ways".&lt;ref name="Adler2003"/&gt; A similar opening was later employed by Virgil in his ''[[Aeneid]]''.&lt;ref name="Adler2003"/&gt;

== Textual transmission ==
[[File:Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema, English (born Netherlands) - A Reading from Homer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''A Reading from Homer'' (1885) by [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]]]]

The orally transmitted Homeric poems were put into written form at some point between the eighth and sixth centuries BC. Some scholars believe that they were dictated by the poet; [[Albert Lord]] noted that, in the process of dictating, the Balkan bards he recorded revised and extended their lays. Some scholars hypothesize that a similar process occurred when the Homeric poems were first written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirk|first1=G. S.|title=Homer and the Oral Tradition|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521213097|pages=117|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgHVXQfEzA4C&amp;pg=PA117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Foley|first1=John Miles|title=Oral Dictated Texts|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1029|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars such as [[Gregory Nagy]] hold that, after the poems were formed in the eight century, they were orally transmitted with little deviation until they were written down in the sixth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nagy|first1=Gregory|title=Poetry as Performance: Homer and Beyond|date=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521558488|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6GCHXNMeHMoC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After textualisation, the poems were each divided into 24 rhapsodes, today referred to as books, and labelled by the letters of the [[Greek alphabet]]. These divisions probably date from before 200 BC, and may have been made by Homer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=West|first1=Martin L.|title=Book Division|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe0253|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In antiquity, it was widely held that the Homeric poems were collected and organised in Athens in the late sixth century BC by the tyrant [[Pesistratos]] (died 528/7 BC), in what subsequent scholars have dubbed the "Pesistratean recension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jensen|first1=Minna Skafte|title=The Homeric Question and the Oral-formulaic Theory|date=1980|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press|isbn=9788772890968|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgyJoouOkyAC&amp;pg=PA128|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; The idea that the Homeric poems were originally transmitted orally and first written down during the reign of Peisistratos is referenced by the first-century BC Roman orator [[Cicero]] and is also referenced in a number of other surviving sources, including two ancient ''Lives of Homer''.&lt;ref name="Lamberton2010"/&gt; From around 150 BC, the texts of the Homeric poems seem to have become relatively established. After the establishment of the [[Library of Alexandria]], Homeric scholars such as [[Zenodotus]] of Ephesus, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and in particular [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] helped establish a canonical text.&lt;ref name=Haslam2012&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Haslam|first1=Michael|title=Text and Transmission|journal=The Homer Encyclopedia|date=2012|doi=10.1002/9781444350302.wbhe1413|language=en|isbn=9781405177689}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first printed edition of Homer was produced in 1488 in Milan. Today scholars use medieval manuscripts, [[papyri]] and other sources; some argue for a 'multi-text' view, rather than seeking a single definitive text. The nineteenth-century edition of [[Arthur Ludwich]] mainly follows Aristarchus's work, whereas van Thiel's (1991,1996) follows the medieval vulgate. Others, such as [[Martin Litchfield West|Martin West]] (1998-2000) or T.W. Allen fall somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref name=Haslam2012/&gt;

'''Islamic views on slavery''' represent a complex and multifaceted body of Islamic thought,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Brockopp, Jonathan E., “Slaves and Slavery”, in: Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān, General Editor: Jane Dammen McAuliffe, Georgetown University, Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brunschvig, R., “ʿAbd”, in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C.E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt; with various Islamic groups or thinkers espousing views on the matter which have been radically different throughout history.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010401012040/http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html |date=2001-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Slavery was a mainstay of life in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] and surrounding lands.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; It was in this social milieu that Islam emerged, whence the [[Quran]] and the ''[[hadith]]'' (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) address slavery extensively, assuming its existence as part of society but viewing it as an exceptional condition and restricting its scope.&lt;ref name="eois"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OEIW&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Dror Ze’evi|title=Slavery|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/214|date=|accessdate=2017-02-23|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223125519/http://bridgingcultures.neh.gov/muslimjourneys/items/show/214|archivedate=2017-02-23|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early Islamic dogma forbade enslavement of free members of Islamic society, including non-Muslims (''[[dhimmis]]''), and set out to improve conditions of human bondage. The sharīʿah (divine law) regarded as legal slaves only those non-Muslims who were imprisoned or bought beyond the borders of Islamic rule, or the sons and daughters of slaves already in captivity.&lt;ref name=OEIW/&gt; In later [[Sharia|classical Islamic law]], the topic of slavery is covered at great length.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Slaves, be they Muslim or those of any other religion, were equal to their fellow practitioners in religious issues.&lt;ref&gt;See: Martin (2005), pp.150 and 151; Clarence-Smith (2006), p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Race and Color in Islam,'' Harper and Row, 1970, quote on page 38. The brackets are displayed by Lewis.&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves played various social and economic roles, from domestic worker to high-ranking positions in the government like [[Emir]]. Moreover, slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, and the army. Some rulers even relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that they seized power. In some cases, the treatment of slaves was so harsh that it led to uprisings, such as the [[Zanj Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence-Smith (2006), pp.2-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was an exception rather than the norm, as the vast [[Islamic economics in the world#Labour force|majority of labor]] in the medieval [[Muslim world|Islamic world]] consisted of free, [[Wage labour|paid labour]].&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|author=William D. Phillips|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|year=1985|isbn=0-7190-1825-0|page=76|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a variety of reasons, internal growth of the slave population was not enough to fulfill the demand in Muslim society. This resulted in massive importation, which involved enormous suffering and loss of life from the capture and transportation of slaves from non-Muslim lands.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran provides for [[manumission|emancipation]] of a slave as a means of religious atonement for sins.&lt;ref name="Holy Quran Exegesis by ibn Kathir"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2426&amp;Itemid=79|title=Quran Tafsir Ibn Kathir - The Command to grant Slaves a Contract of Emancipation|first=Administrator|last=N|website=www.qtafsir.com|access-date=2014-12-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402031805/http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2426&amp;Itemid=79|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|reason=This is a dubious questionable interpretation of this verse|date=June 2017}}

The Arab slave trade was most active in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Africa. In the early 20th century (post [[World War I]]), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; For example, [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]] only abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain; [[Oman]] followed suit in 1970, and [[Mauritania]] in 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Klein (2002), Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition, Page xxii, {{ISBN|0810841029}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, slavery claiming the sanction of Islam is documented presently in the predominantly Islamic countries of [[Chad]], [[Mauritania]], [[Niger]], [[Mali]], and [[Sudan]].&lt;ref&gt;Segal, page 206. See later in article.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Segal, page 222. See later in article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many early converts to Islam were the poor and former slaves. One notable example is [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]].&lt;ref&gt;The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English By Ali Ünal [https://books.google.com/books?id=DyuqdDIjaswC&amp;pg=PA1323 page 1323]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Slaves and Slavery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilal b. Rabah, [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavery in pre-Islamic Arabia==
Slavery was widely practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as well as in the rest of the ancient and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] world. The minority were white slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of [[Bedouin]] captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native [[Arab]] slaves had also existed, a prime example being [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave population increased by the custom of [[child abandonment]] (see also [[infanticide]]), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Lewis (1992) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; There is no conclusive evidence of the existence of enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families; the late and rare accounts of such occurrences show them to be abnormal, Brunschvig states&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; (According to Brockopp, debt slavery was persistent.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Two classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into [[prostitution]] for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn (1949) pp. 54—58
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Esposito"&gt;John L Esposito (1998) p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

The historical accounts of the early years of Islam report that "slaves of non-Muslim masters ... suffered brutal punishments. [[Sumayyah bint Khayyat]] is famous as the first martyr of Islam, having been killed with a spear by Abū Jahl when she refused to give up her faith. [[Abu Bakr]] freed [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]] when his master, Umayya ibn Khalaf, placed a heavy rock on his chest in an attempt to force his conversion."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;

==Slavery in the Quran==
{{Quran}}
[[File:Bilal.jpg|thumb|[[Bilal ibn Ribah]] (''pictured'', atop the [[Kaaba]]) an Ethiopian former slave, was appointed by Muhammad as the first official [[muezzin]]. He had been emancipated when [[Abu Bakr]] paid his ransom upon Muhammad's instruction. The image depicts an episode in January 630, when he became the first Muslim to proclaim [[adhan]] in [[Mecca]].]]

{{quote|The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the slaves and the debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarer; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Quran|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=60|website=corpus.quran.com|accessdate=6 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113160912/http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=9&amp;verse=60|archive-date=2016-01-13|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The mainstream view is that the Quran accepts the institution of slavery. It may be noted that the word 'abd' (slave) is rarely used, being more commonly replaced by some periphrasis such as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' ("that which your right hands own"). However the meaning and translation of this term has been disputed. W.G. Clarence-Smith has highlighted the [[Ideas of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez#Islam and Individual Liberty|point of view of Ghulam Ahmed Pervez on this issue]], who argued that the term is used in the past-tense in the Quran, thus signalling only those individuals who were already enslaved at the dawn of Islam. This slight change in tense is significant, as it allowed G.A. Parwez to argue that slavery was never compatible with the commandments of the Quran and is in fact outlawed by Quranic Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=William|title=Islam and the Abolition of Slavery|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195221516|page=198|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nQbylEdqJKkC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=slavery+quran#v=onepage&amp;q=slavery%20quran&amp;f=false|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mainstream view; however, is that the Qur'an recognizes the basic inequality between master and slave and the rights of the former over the latter. The historian Brunschvig states that from a spiritual perspective, "the slave has the same value as the free man, and the same eternity is in store for his soul; in this earthly life, failing emancipation, there remains the fact of his inferior status, to which he must piously resign himself."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|16|71}}, {{Quran-usc|30|28}})&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lewis, the Quran urges kindness to the slave&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|36}}, {{Quran-usc|9|60}}, {{Quran-usc|24|58}})&lt;/ref&gt; and recommends their liberation by purchase or manumission. The freeing of slaves is recommended both for the expiation of sins&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|4|92}}, {{Quran-usc|5|92}}, {{Quran-usc|58|3}})&lt;/ref&gt; and as an act of simple benevolence.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|177}}, {{Quran-usc|24|33}}, {{Quran-usc|90|13}})&lt;/ref&gt; It exhorts masters to allow slaves to earn or purchase their own freedom ([[Mukataba|manumission contracts]])."&lt;ref name="L1"&gt;Lewis 1990, page 6. All Qur'anic citations are his.&lt;/ref&gt;

Slaves are mentioned in at least twenty-nine verses of the Qur'an, most of these are Medinan and refer to the [[legal status]] of slaves. The legal material on slavery in the Qur'an is largely restricted to manumission and [[Human sexual behavior|sexual relations]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; According to Sikainga, the Qur'anic references to slavery as mainly contain "broad and general propositions of an ethical nature rather than specific legal formulations."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga (2005), p.5-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran accepts the distinction between slave and free as part of the natural order and uses this distinction as an example of God's grace,&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|16|71}}&lt;/ref&gt; regarding this discrimination between human beings as in accordance with the divinely established order of things.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EoI&lt;/ref&gt; "The Qur'an, however, does not consider slaves to be mere chattel; their humanity is directly addressed in references to their beliefs,&lt;ref name=q2221425&gt;({{Quran-usc|2|221}}, {{Quran-usc|4|25}})&lt;/ref&gt; their desire for manumission and their feelings about being forced into prostitution.&lt;ref&gt;({{Quran-usc|24|33}})&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, the Qur'an refers to master and slave with the same word, ''rajul''. Later interpreters presume slaves to be spiritual equals of free Muslims. For example, verse 4:25&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|4|25}}&lt;/ref&gt; urges believers to marry 'believing maids that your right hands own' and then states: "The one of you is as the other," which the Jalaalayn interpret as "You and they are equal in faith, so do not refrain from marrying them." The human aspect of slaves is further reinforced by reference to them as members of the private household, sometimes along with wives or children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|23|6}}{{Quran-usc|24|58}}{{Quran-usc|33|50}}{{Quran-usc|70|30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; The Prophet ordered slave-owners to address their slaves by such euphemistic terms as "my boy" and "my girl" stemmed from the belief that God, not their masters, was responsible for the slave's status.&lt;ref&gt;Marmon in Marmon (1999), page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many common features between the institution of slavery in the Quran and that of neighboring cultures. However, the Quranic institution had some unique new features.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; [[Bernard Lewis]] states that the Qur'anic legislation brought two major changes to ancient slavery which were to have far-reaching effects: presumption of freedom, and the ban on the enslavement of free persons except in strictly defined  circumstances.&lt;ref name="L1"/&gt; According to Brockopp, the idea of using alms for the manumission of slaves appears to be unique to the Quran, assuming the traditional interpretation of verses {{Quran-usc|2|177}} and {{Quran-usc|9|60}}. Similarly, the practice of freeing slaves in atonement for certain sins appears to be introduced by the Quran (but compare Exod 21:26-7).&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; The forced prostitution of female slaves, a Near Eastern custom of great antiquity, is condemned in the Quran.&lt;ref name="Esposito" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Quran-usc|24|33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray Gordon notes that this ban is "of no small significance."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1989, page 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Brockopp writes: "Other cultures limit a master's right to harm a slave but few exhort masters to treat their slaves kindly, and the placement of slaves in the same category as other weak members of society who deserve protection is unknown outside the Qur'an. The unique contribution of the Qur'an, then, is to be found in its emphasis on the place of slaves in society and society's responsibility toward the slave, perhaps the most progressive legislation on slavery in its time."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Maurice Middleberg, "[[Surat al-Balad|Sura 90 in the Quran]] states that the righteous path involves 'the freeing of slaves.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/faiths-unite-end-modern-slavery/index.html|title='All faiths can unite to end modern slavery|last=Middleberg|first=Maurice|date=2016-04-22|work=CNN|access-date=2018-09-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904052731/https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/opinions/faiths-unite-end-modern-slavery/index.html|archive-date=2018-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muhammad's traditions===
The most notable of Muhammad's slaves were: [[Safiyya bint Huyayy]], whom he freed and married; [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], given to Muhammad by [[Muqawqis|a Sassanid official]], whom he freed and who may have become his wife;&lt;ref&gt;from "Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir" (Book of the Major Classes) by Ibn Sa'd's&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sirin (Islamic history)|Sirin]], Maria's sister, whom he freed and married to the poet [[Hassan ibn Thabit]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lastprophet.info/en/content/view/111/14/1/17/ Aydin, p.17 (citing Ibn Abdilberr, İstîâb, IV, p. 1868; Nawavî, Tahzib al Asma, I, p. 162; Ibn al Asîr, Usd al Ghâbe, VI, p. 160)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721220312/http://www.lastprophet.info/en/content/view/111/14/1/17/ |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], whom Muhammad freed and [[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|adopted as a son]].&lt;ref&gt;Hughes (1996), p. 370&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic jurisprudence==

===Traditional Islamic jurisprudence===

====Principles====
In [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], slavery was an exceptional condition,{{additional citation|date=June 2017}} with the general rule being a presumption of freedom (''al-'asl huwa 'l-hurriya'' — "''The basic principle is liberty''") for a person if his or her origins were unknown.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}} Lawful enslavement was restricted to two instances: capture in war (on the condition that the prisoner is not a Muslim), or birth in slavery. Islamic law did not recognize the classes of slave from [[pre-Islamic Arabia]] including those sold or given into slavery by themselves and others, and those indebted into slavery.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; Though a free Muslim could not be enslaved, [[Religious conversion|conversion to Islam]] by a non-Muslim slave did not require that he or she then should be liberated. Slave status was not affected by conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Treatment====
In the instance of illness it would be required for the slave to be looked after. [[Manumission]] is considered a meritorious act. Based on the Quranic verse (24:33), Islamic law permits a slave to ransom himself upon consent of his master through a contract known as ''[[mukataba]]''.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; [[Azizah Y. al-Hibri]], a professor of Law specializing in Islamic jurisprudence, states that both the Qur'an and Hadith are repeatedly exhorting Muslims to treat the slaves well and that Muhammad showed this both in action and in words.&lt;ref name="Hibri"&gt;Azizah Y. al-Hibri, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Levy concurs, adding that "cruelty to them was forbidden."&lt;ref name="L77"&gt;Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Hibri quotes the famous last speech of Muhammad and other hadiths emphasizing that all believers, whether free or enslaved, are siblings.&lt;ref name="Hibri"/&gt; Lewis explains, "the humanitarian tendency of the Qur'an and the early caliphs in the Islamic empire, was to some extent counteracted by other influences,"&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; notably the practice of various conquered people and countries Muslims encountered, especially in provinces previously under [[Roman law]]. In spite of this, Lewis also states, "Islamic practice still represented a vast improvement on that inherited from antiquity, from Rome, and from Byzantium."&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Murray Gordon writes: "It was not surprising that Muhammad, who accepted the existing socio-political order, looked upon slavery as part of the natural order of things. His approach to what was already an age-old institution was reformist and not revolutionary. The Prophet had not in mind to bring about the abolition of slavery. Rather, his purpose was to improve the conditions of slaves by correcting abuses and appealing to the conscience of his followers to treat them humanely."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of slaves as members of the family was common, according to Levy. If a slave was born and brought up in the master's household he was never sold, except in exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref name="L77"/&gt;

====Sexual intercourse====
{{See also|Ma malakat aymanukum and sex}}
In Islamic law ([[Sharia]]), ''[[Ma malakat aymanukum]]'' is the term for slaves or captives of war. The purchase of female slaves for sex was lawful from the perspective of Islamic law, and this was the most common motive for the purchase of slaves throughout Islamic history.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Muminun]] 6 and [[Al-Maarij]] 30 both, in identical wording, draw a distinction between spouses and "those whom one's right hands possess", saying " أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ" (literally, "their spouses or what their right hands possess"), while clarifying that sexual intercourse with either is permissible.  Sayyid [[Abul Ala Maududi]] explains that "two categories of women have been excluded from the general command of guarding the private parts: (a) wives, (b) women who are legally in one's possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070311085024/http://www.translatedquran.com/meaning.asp?pagetitle=AL+-+MUMINOON&amp;sno=23&amp;tno=1324|deadurl=yes|title=Surah - AL - MUMINOON|date=11 March 2007|archivedate=11 March 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concubinage====
{{Slavery}}
{{see also|Islamic marital jurisprudence}}
Slave women were required mainly as concubines and menials. A Muslim slaveholder was entitled by law to the sexual enjoyment of his slave women. While free women might own male slaves, they had no such right.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The property of a slave was owned by his or her master unless a contract of freedom of the slave had been entered into, which allowed the slave to earn money to purchase his or her freedom and similarly to pay bride wealth. The marriage of slaves required the consent of the owner. Under the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools of jurisprudence male slaves could marry two wives, but the Maliki permitted them to marry four wives like the free men. According to the Islamic law, a male slave could marry a free woman but this was discouraged in practice.&lt;ref name="Sikainga"/&gt; Islam permits sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside marriage. This is referred to in the Qur'an as ''[[ma malakat aymanukum]]'' or "what your right hands possess".&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2 pp. 112-113 footnote 44; Also see commentary on verses {{Quran-usc-range|23|1|6}}: Vol. 3, notes 7-1, p. 241; 2000, Islamic Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]] 4:24&lt;/ref&gt; There are some restrictions on the master; he may not co-habit with a female slave belonging to his wife, neither can he have relations with a female slave if she is co-owned, or already married.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

In ancient Arabian custom, the child of a freeman by his slave was also a slave unless he was recognized and liberated by his father.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, the recognition by a master of his offspring by a slave woman was optional in Islamic society, and in the early period was often withheld. By the [[High Middle Ages]] it became normal and was unremarkable in a society where the sovereigns themselves were almost invariably the children of slave concubines.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The mother receives the title of "umm walad" (''lit''. mother of a child)&lt;ref name="umm walad"&gt;''[http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2424] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170801050417/http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2424 |date=2017-08-01 }}'' Umm al-Walad, "Mother of the son. Refers to a slave woman impregnated by her owner…", Oxford Islamic Studies Online&lt;/ref&gt;, which is an improvement in her status as she can no longer be sold. Among Sunnis, she is automatically freed upon her master's death, however for Shi'a, she is only freed if her child is still alive; her value is then deducted from this child's share of the inheritance.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; Lovejoy writes that as an ''umm walad'', they attained "an intermediate position between slave and free" pending their freedom, although they would sometimes be nominally freed as soon as they gave birth.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;

There is no limit on the number of concubines a master may possess. However, the general marital laws are to be observed, such as not having sexual relations with the sister of a female slave.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt; In Islam, "men are enjoined to marry free women in the first instance, but if they cannot afford the bridewealth for free women, they are told to marry slave women rather than engage in wrongful acts."&lt;ref&gt;Nashat (1999) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; One rationale given for recognition of concubinage in Islam is that "it satisfied the sexual desire of the female slaves and thereby prevented the spread of immorality in the [[Ummah|Muslim community]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga(1996), p.22&lt;/ref&gt; A slave master could have sex with his female slave only while she was not married. This attempt to require sexual exclusivity for female slaves was rare in antiquity, when female slaves generally had no claim to an exclusive sexual relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Kecia  |last=Ali  | authorlink = Kecia Ali | year=2010 | title=Marriage and Slavery in Early Islam |publisher=Harvard University Press|page=39|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C229nbjq8TMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sikainga, "in reality, however, female slaves in many Muslim societies were prey for members of their owners' household, their neighbors, and their guests."&lt;ref&gt;Sikainga (1996) p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shiite jurisprudence it is unlawful for a master of a female slave to grant a third party the use of her for sexual relations.  The Shiite scholar Shaykh al-Tusi stated:ولا يجوز إعارتها للاستمتاع بها لأن البضع لا يستباح بالإعارة
"It is not permissible to loan (the slave girl) for enjoyment purpose, because sexual intercourse cannot be legitimate through loaning"&lt;ref&gt;
Shaykh al-Tusi stated in Al-Mabsut, Volume 3 page 57&lt;/ref&gt; and the Shiite scholars al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki, Allamah al-Hilli and Ali Asghar Merwarid made the following ruling: ولا تجوز استعارة الجواري للاستمتاع
"It is not permissible to loan the slave girl for the purpose of sexual intercourse"&lt;ref&gt;al-Muhaqiq al-Kurki in ''Jame'a al-Maqasid'', Volume 6 page 62, Allamah al-Hilli in ''Al-Tadkira'', Volume 2 page 210 and Ali Asghar Merwarid in ''Al-Yanabi al-Fiqhya'', Volume 17 page 187&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[legal doctrine]] of ''kafa'a''(lit."efficiency"), the purpose of which was to ensure that a man should be at least the social equal of the woman he marries, a freedman is not as good as the son of a freedman, and he in turn not as good as the grandson of a freedman. This principle is pursued up to three generations, after which all Muslims are deemed equally free.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 85&amp;ndash;86&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis asserts that since kafa'a "does not forbid unequal marriages", it is in no sense a "Muslim equivalent of [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nuremberg Laws]] of [[Nazi Germany]] or the apartheid laws of [[South Africa]]. His purpose, he states, is not to try to set up a moral competition - to compare castration and apartheid as offenses against humanity."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph, Review of ''Race and Color in Islam'' by [[Bernard Lewis]], ''[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]'', Vol. 5, No. 3. (Jun., 1974), pp. 368-371.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legal status====
Within [[Islamic jurisprudence]], slaves were excluded from religious office and from any office involving jurisdiction over others.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Freed slaves are able to occupy any office within the [[Caliphate|Islamic government]], and instances of this in history include the [[Mamluk]] who ruled Egypt for almost 260 years and the [[eunuch]]s who have held military and administrative positions of note.&lt;ref name="schimmel"&gt;Schimmel (1992) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; With the permission of their owners they are able to marry.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito (2002) p.148&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annemarie Schimmel]], a contemporary scholar on [[Muslim world|Islamic civilization]], asserts that because the status of slaves under Islam could only be obtained through either being a [[prisoner of war]] (this was soon restricted only to infidels captured in a [[jihad|holy war]])&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; or born from slave parents, slavery would be theoretically abolished with the expansion of Islam.&lt;ref name="schimmel" /&gt; [[Fazlur Rahman]] agrees, stating that the Qur'anic acceptance of the institution of slavery on the legal plane was the only practical option available at the time of Muhammad since "slavery was ingrained in the structure of society, and its overnight wholesale liquidation would have created problems which it would have been absolutely impossible to solve, and only a dreamer could have issued such a visionary statement."&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman, Islam, University of Chicago Press, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Islam's reforms stipulating the conditions of enslavement seriously limited the supply of new slaves.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt; Murray Gordon does note: "Muhammad took pains in urging the faithful to free their slaves as a way of expiating their sins. Some [[List of Muslim scholars|Muslim scholars]] have taken this mean that his true motive was to bring about a gradual elimination of slavery. An alternative argument is that by lending the [[moral authority]] of Islam to slavery, Muhammad assured its legitimacy. Thus, in lightening the fetter, he riveted it ever more firmly in place."&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=5l81hwFPvzYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Slavery in the Arab World]." New Amsterdam Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early days of Islam, a plentiful supply of new slaves were brought due to rapid conquest and expansion. But as the frontiers were gradually stabilized, this supply dwindled to a mere trickle. The prisoners of later wars between Muslims and Christians were commonly ransomed or exchanged.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

According to Lewis, this reduction resulted in Arabs who wanted slaves having to look elsewhere to avoid the restrictions in the Qur'an, meaning an increase of importing of slaves from non-Muslim lands,&lt;ref name="L9010"&gt;Lewis (1990) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; primarily from Africa. These slaves suffered a high death toll.&lt;ref name="Lewis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="L9010"/&gt; [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]] states that Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in [[Arabian Peninsula]] and to a lesser degree for the whole area of the whole [[Umayyad|Umayyad Caliphate]] where slavery had existed since the most ancient times. He however notes that with the passage of time and the extension of Islam, Islam by recognizing and codifying slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Manning (1990) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory free-born Muslims could not be enslaved, and the only way that a non-Muslim could be enslaved was being captured in the course of holy war.&lt;ref name="Sikainga"&gt;Sikainga (1996) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; (In early Islam, neither a Muslim nor a Christian or Jew could be enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito (1998) p.40&lt;/ref&gt;) Slavery was also perceived as a means of converting non-Muslims to Islam: A task of the masters was religious instruction. Conversion and assimilation into the society of the master didn't automatically lead to emancipation, though there was normally some guarantee of better treatment and was deemed a prerequisite for emancipation.&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;Paul Lovejoy (2000) p.2&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of [[Sunni]] authorities approved the [[manumission]] of all the "[[People of the Book]]". According to some jurists -especially among the [[Shi'a]]- only Muslim slaves should be liberated.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis(1990) 106&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, traditional propagators of [[Islam in Africa]] often revealed a cautious attitude towards proselytizing because of its effect in reducing the potential reservoir of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, "Slavery in the [[Arab world|Arab World]]." [[New Amsterdam]] Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Rights and restrictions=====
"Morally as well as physically the slave is regarded in law as an inferior being," Levy writes.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.78&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic law, a slave possesses a composite quality of being both a person and a possession.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave is entitled to receive sustenance from the master, which includes shelter, food, clothing, and medical attention. It is a requirement for this sustenance to be of the same standard generally found in the locality and it is also recommended for the slave to have the same standard of food and clothing as the master. If the master refuses to provide the required sustenance, the slave may complain to a judge, who may then penalize the master through sale of her or his goods as necessary for the slave's keep. If the master does not have sufficient wealth to facilitate this, she or he must either sell, hire out, or manumit the slave as ordered. Slaves also have the right to a period of rest during the hottest parts of the day during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Khalil b. Ishaq, quoted in Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence from slaves is rarely viable in a court of law. As slaves are regarded as inferior in Islamic law, death at the hands of a free man does not require that the latter be killed in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;Except according to Hanafis, who make a free man liable to retaliation in cases of murder&lt;/ref&gt; The killer must pay the slave's master compensation equivalent to the slave's value, as opposed to blood-money. At the same time, slaves themselves possess a lessened responsibility for their actions, and receive half the penalty required upon a free man. For example: where a free man would be subject to a hundred lashes due to pre-marital relations, a slave would be subject to only fifty. Slaves are allowed to marry only with the owner's consent. Jurists differ over how many wives a slave may possess, with the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools allowing them two, and the Maliki school allowing four. Slaves are not permitted to possess or inherit property, or conduct independent business, and may conduct financial dealings only as a representative of the master. Offices of authority are generally not permitted for slaves, though a slave may act as the leader (''[[Imam]]'') in the congregational [[salat|prayers]], and he may also act as a subordinate officer in the governmental department of revenue.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957) pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; Masters may sell, bequeath, give away, pledge, hire out or compel them to earn money.&lt;ref name="L77" /&gt;

By the view of some [[madh'hab]] (but not others), a master may compel his/her slave(s) to marriage and determine the identity of their marriage partner(s)&lt;ref&gt;Khalil bin Ishaq, II, 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sachau, p.173&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[mahr]] that is given for marriage to a female slave is taken by her owner, whereas all other women possess it absolutely for themselves&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.114&lt;/ref&gt;

====Manumission====
The Qur'an and Hadith, the primary Islamic texts, make it a praiseworthy act for masters to [[manumission|set their slaves free]]. There are numerous ways in which a slave may become free. One way is through expiation for certain sins committed by the master, such as involuntary [[manslaughter]] or [[perjury]]. Other ways include emancipation through becoming an ''umm walad''&lt;ref name="umm walad" /&gt;, who is freed upon her master's death along with her children, or an independent act of piety by the master, as recommended by the Quran. It is also commendable to manumit a slave who demands his freedom and is considered worthy of it; however, [[Richard Francis Burton]] states in a footnote to the "Tale of the Second Eunuch", commenting on the proposed emancipation of a slave without employable skills, that "Here the slave refuses to be set free and starve. For a master so to do without ample reasons is held disgraceful. I well remember the weeping and wailing throughout Sind when an order from Sir Charles Napier set free the negroes whom British philanthropy thus doomed to endure if not to die of hunger."&lt;ref name="RFBurton"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is the ''[[mukataba]]'' contract: Levy states that "the slave may redeem himself if his master agrees and contracts to let him go on payment of a stipulated sum of money, which may be paid in two or more instalments, or on the giving of stipulated services or other consideration. If the consideration is a sum of money, the master must grant the slave the right to earn and to own property."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref name="L8081"&gt;Levy pp. 80-81&lt;/ref&gt;

If the master makes a declaration of the slave's freedom, whether in jest or earnest, in the presence of the slave or another, then such a declaration becomes legally binding. Similarly, the master may promise manumission (verbally or in writing) that the slave is to be freed upon the former's death. Lastly, a slave is also freed automatically if she or he comes into the possession of a master who is directly related to her or him.&lt;ref name="L8081"/&gt;

Gordon opines that the Quran in particular and Islamic jurisprudence in general have not placed a premium on manumission but held it out as one way for atonement of sin. He states that "Manumission was only one of several virtuous observances that the pious could avail themselves of and was by no means the most important,"&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Gordon 1987, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that other options include reaffirming faith in God and giving food to the poor. He concludes that "there was no contradiction between being a devout Muslim and a slave-owing one as well."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1987, pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern interpretations==
=== Abolitionism ===
The abolition movement starting in the 19th century in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml|title=British Anti-slavery|last=Oldfield|first=John|date=2011-02-07|website=British History in depth|publisher=BBC History|access-date=2016-10-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160925213603/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/antislavery_01.shtml|archive-date=2016-09-25|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in other Western countries influenced the slavery in Muslim lands both in doctrine and in practice.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; One of the first religious decrees comes from the two highest dignitaries of the Hanafi and Maliki rites in the Ottoman Empire. These religious authorities declared that slavery is lawful in principle but it is regrettable in its consequences. They expressed two religious considerations in their support for abolition of slavery: "the initial enslaving of the people concerned comes under suspicion of illegality by reason of the present-day expansion of Islam in their countries; masters no longer comply with the rules of good treatment which regulate their rights and shelter them from wrong-doing."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

According to Brunschvig, although the total abolition of slavery might seem a reprehensible innovation and contrary to the Qur'an and the practice of early Muslims, the realities of the modern world caused a "discernible evolution in the thought of many educated Muslims before the end of the 19th century."&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; These Muslims argued that Islam on the whole has "bestowed an exceptionally favourable lot on the victims of slavery" and that the  institution of slavery is linked to the particular economic and social stage in which Islam originated. According to the influential thesis of [[Syed Ameer Ali|Ameer Ali]], Islam only tolerated slavery through temporary necessity and that its complete abolition was not possible at the time of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

According to  Brockopp, some modern interpreters have accused the medieval interpreters of having subverted the Qur'an's demand for manumission contracts (see [[Mukataba]]). They have used the dramatic change in the institution of slavery in the 7th and 8th centuries to argue that the Qur'an would not have condoned the slaving practices common in Islamic history. Others{{who|date=June 2017}} have argued that the original intent of the Qur'an, when understood properly, was to abolish slavery altogether.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2017}}{{additional citation|date=June 2017}}

The idea that Islam only tolerated slavery due to necessity has to some extent found its way into the circle of the [[Ulema]].&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt; It has been unable to gain support among the [[Wahhabi]]s.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

===Islamist opinions===
[[File:Sayyid Qutb.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Sayyid Qutb]]]]

Earlier in the 20th century, prior to the "reopening" of slavery by [[Salafi]] scholars like Shaykh al-Fawzan, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly affirming and promoting its abolition. This has caused at least one scholar (William Clarence-Smith&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417083811/http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36 |date=April 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to bemoan the "dogged refusal of [[Abul A'la Maududi|Mawlana Mawdudi]] to give up on slavery"&lt;ref name=CS-maududi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=W.

[[Sayyid Qutb]], the scholar of the Islamist [[Muslim Brotherhood]] said in his exegesis (''[[Tafsir]]'') of the Quran:
&lt;blockquote&gt;And concerning slavery, that was when slavery was a world-wide structure and which was conducted amongst Muslims and their enemies in the form of enslaving of prisoners of war. And it was necessary for Islam to adopt a similar line of practise until the world devised a new code of practise during war other than enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;in [[Fi Zilal al-Qur'an]], Surah Tawbah (3/1669) also in Tafsir of Surah Baqarah (/230), tafsir of Surah Mu'minoon (4/2455), tafsir of Surah Muhammad (6/3285)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qutb's brother [[Muhammad Qutb]] contrasted sexual relations between Muslim slave-owners and their female slaves with (in his view), the widespread and depraved practice of casual consensual sex in contemporary Europe:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Islam made it lawful for a master to have a number of slave-women captured in wars and enjoined that he alone may have sexual relations with them ... Europe abhors this law but at the same gladly allows that most odious form of animalism according to which a man may have illicit relations with any girl coming across him on his way to gratify his animal passions.&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Muhammad, ''Islam, the Misunderstood Religion'', Markazi Maktabi Islami, Delhi-6, 1992 p.50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Abul A'la Maududi]] of [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-e-Islami]] has said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam has clearly and categorically forbidden the primitive practice of capturing a free man, to make him a slave or to sell him into slavery. On this point the clear and unequivocal words of [[Muhammad]] are as follows:&lt;blockquote style="font-size:inherit; quotes:none"&gt;"There are three categories of people against whom I shall myself be a plaintiff on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]]. Of these three, one is he who enslaves a free man, then sells him and eats this money" (al-Bukhari and Ibn Majjah).&lt;/blockquote&gt; The words of this Tradition of the Prophet are also general, they have not been qualified or made applicable to a particular nation, race, country or followers of a particular religion.&amp;nbsp;... After this the only form of slavery which was left in Islamic society was the prisoners of war, who were captured on the battlefield. These prisoners of war were retained by the Muslim Government until their government agreed to receive them back in exchange for Muslim soldiers captured by them&amp;nbsp;...&lt;ref&gt;From "Human Rights in Islam" by 'Allamah Abu Al-'A'la Mawdudi.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When Islam came, for the situations where people were taken into slavery (e.g. debt), Islam imposed Shari’ah solutions to those situations other than slavery. ... It (Islam) made the existing slave and owner form a business contract, based upon the freedom, not upon slavery ...  As for the situation of war, ...  it clarified the rule of the captive in that either they are favoured by releasing without any exchange, or they are ransomed for money or exchanged for Muslims or non-Muslim citizens of the [[Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;''al-Shakhsiyah al-Islamiyyah'' (The Islamic Personality) by [[Taqiuddin al-Nabhani]], Volume 3, Slavery Section&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The website of the organization stresses that because sharia historically was responding to a contract, not the institution of slavery, a future Khilafah could not re-introduce slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/the-khilafah/foreign-policy/2764-the-islamic-view-on-slaves-and-slavery "The Islamic view on Slaves and Slavery"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111114656/http://www.khilafah.com/index.php/the-khilafah/foreign-policy/2764-the-islamic-view-on-slaves-and-slavery |date=2010-11-11 }}, khilafah.com 13 May 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''January Magazine''''' is an internet-based book-related publication. Founded by author [[Linda L. Richards]] in 1997, ''January'' has added various sections and offshoot publications since. The magazine is physically based in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], but works with contributors all over the world. The mandate of the publication is "books in the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookmarket.com/magazines-books.htm Book Review Magazines] ''Book Market''. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

''January'' is recognized for its "well-written" book reviews as well as the author interviews it has published,&lt;ref&gt;"Bookmark Detail: ''January Magazine''," Computer User, [http://www.computeruser.com/links/detail/january-magazine/onecat/root+arts+literature/0/*.html Computeruser.com]&lt;/ref&gt; including exchanges with [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Dennis Lehane]], [[Loren D.

'''Lākhey''' ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: लाखे, lā-khé) (alternative spellings '''Lākhe''', '''Lākhay''', लाखय्) is a demon in Nepalese folklore. He is depicted with a ferocious face, protruding fangs and mane of red or black hair. Lakhes figure prominently in traditional [[Newar]] culture of [[Nepal Mandala]]. The Lakhe tradition is found in the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and other Newar settlements throughout [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gurung| first = Anuj | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/nepal/demon-among-deities| title = A Demon Among Deities| work = Cultural Survival| publisher = | date=Spring 2009| accessdate = 23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lakhes are said to be demons who used to live in the forests and later became protectors to the townspeople.&lt;ref&gt;Trussler, Simon and Barker, Clive (1 September 2003). ''New Theatre Quarterly 74, Volume 19.'' Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0521535891}}, 9780521535892. Page 127.&lt;/ref&gt; A female Lakhe is known as Lasin (लसिं).

The other common legendary being in Nepalese folklore is the [[Khyah (legendary creature)|Khyāh]], who is depicted as a fat, hairy ape-like creature.

==Dancing Lakhes==

Lakhey Dance is one of the most popular dances of Nepal. Performers wearing a Lakhe costume and mask perform dances on the streets and city squares during festivals. The mask is made of [[papier-mâché]] and [[yak]] tails are used for the hair. The Lakhe dance is characterised by wild movements and thumping music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.sikkim-culture.gov.in/Dances/Trance%20Dances.aspx| title = Lakhey Mask Dance| work = | publisher = Cultural Affairs and Heritage Department, Government of Sikkim| date=| accessdate = 24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous Lakhe is [[Majipa Lakhey]] of [[Kathmandu]] who appears during the [[Yenya]] (Indra Jatra) festival in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Toffin| first = Gérard | authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/64459961/Indra-Jatra-of-Kathmandu-Gerard-Toffin| title = The Indra Jātrā of Kathmandu as a Royal Festival Past and Present| work = Contributions to Nepalese Studies| publisher = Center for Nepal and Asian Studies, Tribhuvan University| date=January 1992| accessdate = 24 July 2012}} Page 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koizumi, Fumio (1983). ''Dance and music in South Asian drama: Chhau, Mahākālī pyākhan and Yakshagāna.'' Academia Music. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; He is worshipped as a deity. City dwellers offer food and ritual items to him as he moves through the city accompanied by his musical band giving dance performances.

The Lakhe stops at major crossroads and market squares to give a performance. During the dance, a small boy is known as Jhyalincha (झ्यालिंचा) taunts the Lakhe making him chase him in anger. Jhyalincha always manages to slip into the crowd and escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bajracharya |first=Chunda |editor-first=Subash Ram |editor-last=Prajapati |title=The Masked Dances of Nepal Mandal|publisher=Thimi: Madhyapur Art Council|date=2006|chapter=Majipa Lakhe|isbn=99946-707-0-0}} Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunla Lakhe comes out during [[Gunla]], the 10th month in the [[Nepal Sambat]] calendar which corresponds to August.

==Other Lakhes==

There are other Lakhes with particular characteristics. These mythical beings are said to reside in various parts of the city.

* Michyāh Lākhe (मिच्या: लाखे) (meaning "fire burning demon" in [[Nepal Bhasa]]) is a spirit who is said to cause a fire by [[spontaneous combustion]] wherever it resides. People possessed by Michyāh Lakhe are also believed to cause a fire. 
* Minpu Lākhe (मिंपू लाखे) also causes a fire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24423">The '''lines of partition''' used to [[division of the field|divide]] and [[variations of the field|vary]] [[field (heraldry)|fields]] and charges in [[heraldry]] are by default straight, but may have many different shapes.  Care must sometimes be taken to distinguish these types of lines from the extremely unusual and non-traditional use of lines as charges,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyBFBT/ArmyBFBTUnit.aspx?u=4892 |title=1 Squadron 91 Cavalry Regiment |publisher=[[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|The Institute of Heraldry]] |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to distinguish these shapes from actual charges, such as "a mount [or triple mount] in base," or, particularly in [[German heraldry]], different kinds of embattled from castle walls.

In [[Scotland]], varied lines of partition are often used to modify a [[bordure]] (or sometimes another [[ordinary (heraldry)|ordinary]]) to difference the arms of a [[cadency|cadet]] from the chief of the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |title=Beginners Heraldry |author=Mark Harden |work=The Heraldry Society of Scotland |accessdate=2011-06-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013201010/http://www.heraldry-scotland.co.uk/beginners.html |archivedate=2008-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Indented and dancetty ==
[[File:Dentelé.png|thumb|Per fess indented argent and gules]]
An ordinary ''indented'' is bounded by small zigzags like a [[triangle wave]], with peaks on one side matching peaks on the other.  An ordinary ''dancetty'' is similar, but with peaks matching troughs, so that the width is constant; it also typically has fewer points than ''indented''.  In early armory these were not distinguished.  In the arms of the [[55th Electronic Combat Group]] of the [[United States Air Force]] the indented is "edged wider on the back angle (sinister) than on the face (dexter) of each angle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=55th Electronic Combat Group|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/AirForce/AirForceUnit.aspx?u=6297|accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dentilly'' is a modern invention, similar to ''indented'', but with one of the sides of the points perpendicular and the other angled, as in a [[sawtooth wave]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''Rayonné'' (also ''rayonne'', ''rayonny''; from French ''[[wikt:rayonner|rayonner]]'') may be considered a variant of indented, but with wavy instead of straight lines, as in the conventional representation of rays of the sun.  ''Rayonne palewise'' appears in the arms of the 172d Support Battalion of the United States Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=172 Support Battalion|url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=4486|publisher=The Institute of Heraldry|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A chief enarched rayonné on a gold field appears in the arms of [[Sechelt]], British Columbia, forming the appearance of a sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District of Sechelt|url=http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=621&amp;ProjectElementID=2198|publisher=The Governor General of Canada|website=Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada|date=14 June 1996|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms of the Worshipful Company of Security Professionals contain an example of ''indented acute,'' a form of indented with higher peaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 2008 Newsletter (No. 17) – College of Arms|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/newsletter/2008/item/49-june-2008-newsletter-no-17|accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of peaks in indented is almost never specified, but an exception is the arms of Arthur D. Stairs: ''Per bend sinister indented of six steps Gules and Sable'', and Westville, Natal, South Africa bears ''Sable, issuant from behind a fence of spears in base Argent, a fig tree in leaf  Or;  on a chief indented of four points to base, also Or, three lion's faces Sable''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In South Africa there are a number of examples of ''dancetty inverted''.  While the number of peaks in dancetty are three unless otherwise specified, the arms of Wagland show ''dancetty of two points''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitelionsociety.co.uk/armorial/wagland.html|title=Wagland|work=The White Lion Society|accessdate=2011-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722004657/http://www.whitelionsociety.co.uk/armorial/wagland.html|archivedate=2011-07-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the arms of Baz Manning show a chief "dancetty of two full points upwards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldic-arts.com/article-manning1.htm|title=The Call to Arms – Baz Manning|work=Society of Heraldic Arts|accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The arms of the Matroosberg Transitional Representative Council in South Africa give an example of ''dancetty… in the shape of a letter W''.  The arms of the French department of [[Côtes d'Armor]] show ''émanché,'' which would be equivalent to the English ''per fess dancetty of two full points upwards.''  The arms of [[Baron Griffiths of Fforestfach]] are ''Paly of four Vert and Argent per fess enhanced indented of two points upwards each point double barbed throughout issuing in base a pile double barbed throughout all counterchanged''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/publications/heraldrygazette/2007-Dec.pdf |title=Heraldry of New Life Peers |author=Peter Ll Gwynn-Jones |work=The Heraldry Gazette |date=December 2007 |issue=106 |series=New |pages=10–11 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of Alaric John Martin Woodrow show an example of ''barry dancetty each point double barbed'', used to represent a line of fir trees as a play on the surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=583&amp;ProjectElementID=2054 |title=Alaric John Martin Woodrow |work=The Canadian Heraldic Authority |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://web.archive.org/web/20040103093950/http://www.polity.org.za/html/govdocs/misc/fscoat.html arms of the Free State] in [[South Africa]] show "a chief dancetty, the peaks terminating in merlons," and so might be called a combination of dancetty and embattled; a similar hybrid can be seen in the arms of the Agricultural Gymnasium.  Hoerskool Hangklip provide an example of ''dancetty with points flattened'', and Blouberg of ''dancetty the peaks couped.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091915/http://sahw.bravehost.com/e-des.htm]  It is difficult to know whether to characterise the "wall-like extremity with five merlons and four embrasures" in the arms of the [[Kurgan Oblast]] in Russia as a divided field or a charge.[http://www.heraldry.hobby.ru/eng/e.kurgan.html]

The arms of Ernest John Altobello show a chevronel with the upper edge ''grady'' (this is identical in appearance to indented) "and ensigned of a tower Argent".

== Wavy and nebuly ==
[[File:Nébulé.png|thumb|Per fess nebuly argent and gules]]
A line ''wavy'' (also called ''undy'')&lt;ref name="line"&gt;{{cite book |author=Mackinnon of Dunakin, Charles |title=The Observer's Book of Heraldry |year=1968 |publisher=Frederick Warne and Co. Ltd. |pages=48–50 |accessdate=2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[sine wave]], often used to represent water; a line ''[[nebuly]]'' is similar but with more exaggerated [[meander]]s, representing clouds.  There are confusing, ambiguous and non-standard uses of ''a wavy'' in the military heraldry of the United States to refer to irregularly wavy lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.afcyber.af.mil/News/Imagery/igphoto/2000153626/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wavy chief in the arms of Lord Nelson was blazoned as ''undulated''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baronage.co.uk/nl/nl-02-07.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of the arms of the 40th Finance Battalion of the United States Army is blazoned [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610173340/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Heraldry/ArmyDUISSICOA/ArmyHeraldryUnit.aspx?u=3569 ''per fess wavy (in the manner of a Taeguk)'']  The chief in the arms of Professor S.W. Haines is ''wavy of one crest and depressed in the centre of one point''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Haines.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201080818/http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/Haines.htm |archive-date=2008-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''wavy crested'' the waves appear like pointed breakers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.snodgrass-clan.com/grant.html{{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arms of James Hill show an example of barrulets ''wavy crested to the sinister on the upper edge''.&lt;ref&gt;http://heraldry-scotland.com/copgal/displayimage.php?album=7&amp;pos=97&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples of even greater complexity and specificity in the ''wavy'' line, such as the arms of "Baron Nolan ... [which include] three 'bars wavy couped composed of two troughs and a wave invected of one point on the upper edge and engrailed of one point on the lower edge'".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grsampson.net/AHtc.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Specification of the number of "undulations" in nebuly can be seen by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110721191327/http://www.americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=Armorial.WilkeJ Jochen Wilke]'s roundel, with ten.  (It is uncommon for lines of partition to modify a charge other than an ordinary.)

== Engrailed and invected ==
[[File:Blason duche fr Berry (moderne).svg|thumb|The [[duke of Berry|ducs de Berry]] bore the French royal arms with ''a [[bordure]] engrailed [[gules]]'' for difference.]]

These lines consist of a series of circular arcs curving in the same direction, meeting at angles, forming points outward (''engrailed'') or inward (''invected'').  When these terms are applied to a partition rather than to an ordinary, the first part of the field is the "interior".

The arms of [[Liverpool Hope University]] include ''a Cross engrailed of one point on each limb''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arms, Crest, Supporters and Badge of Liverpool Hope University - College of Arms|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/news-grants/grants/item/19-liverpool-hope-uni|publisher=College of Arms|accessdate=1 July 2017|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Flag of Flintshire]] is ''Argent a cross engrailed sable between four Cornish choughs proper''.

[[File:Flag of Flintshire.svg|thumb|left|The [[Flag of Flintshire]] includes ''a cross engrailed sable''.]]
The arms of the Pretoria Philatelic Society show a ''chief engrailed and couped'', having the appearance of the edge of a [[perforation|perforated]] [[postage stamp]]. The arms of Kutlwanong Dorp in South Africa provide an example both of the specification of the number of lobes in invected, and those lobes being ''trefly.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Club and Society Heraldry|url=http://www.geocities.com/heraldrysa/1-corg3.htm|publisher=South African Heraldry|accessdate=1 July 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027111021/http://www.geocities.com/heraldrysa/1-corg3.htm|archivedate=27 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Embattled and variants == &lt;!-- courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Embattled (heraldry)]] links here. --&gt;
[[File:Bresseté.png|thumb|Argent, a fess bretessé gules]]
A line ''embattled'' is a [[square wave]], representing the [[battlements]] of a castle.

When a fess is embattled, only the topmost edge is altered (as in the arms of [[Muri bei Bern]]). If both edges are to be embattled, the term ''embattled-counter-embattled'' (or ''counter-embattled,'' as in the arms of Sir Cecil Denniston Burney) is used. In this case the lines are parallel. If gaps face gaps, the term ''bretessé'' is used.  There is at least one emblazonment suggesting that the orle is only embattled on its outer edge.

Italian armory has a variant, [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Ghibelline]] battlement, with notched merlons.
&lt;!-- What's the exact phrase? something ''alla ghibellina'', I think --&gt;

In a line ''raguly'' the extensions are oblique rather than orthogonal, like the stumps of limbs protruding from a tree-trunk.

''[[dovetail joint|Dovetailed]]'' is as in carpentry.  Unlike embattled, gaps face gaps.

''Potenty'' may be considered a variant in which the points are extended to ''T''-shapes ("potent" means a crutch).

A line ''embattled grady''[http://www.armorial-register.com/arms-es/moore-sr-arms.html] or ''battled embattled''[https://web.archive.org/web/20031224175209/http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/andersdaae.htm] consists of series of two or three steps, as if each [[merlon]] has a smaller merlon atop it.  Parker's glossary says that ''double-embattled'' may be the same as this.

The arms of [[Schellenberg]], in [[Liechtenstein]], provide an example of embattled "with three battlements."[http://www.ngw.nl/int/oveur/schellen.htm]  The [[bordure]] in the arms of [[Boissy l'Aillerie]], in [[Val d'Oise]], [[France]], has nine battlements (and the bordure is also masoned and contains doorlike openings).

A very unusual occurrence of embattled occurs in the arms of the 136th Military Police Battalion of the United States Army: ''Sable, a fesse enhanced and embattled Or, overall a magnifying glass palewise rim Argent (Silver Gray), the glass surmounting and enlarging the middle crenel between two merlons, the handle Gules edged of the second bearing a mullet Argent.''[https://web.archive.org/web/20060507150742/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/MP/136MilitaryPoliceBattalion.htm]

The arms of [[Baron Kirkwood]] show two chevronels ''round embattled'' (the merlons are rounded rather than squares).  There are also examples of ''embattled pointed''[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091915/http://sahw.bravehost.com/e-des.htm] and ''embattled in the form of mine dumps''.

James Parker cites the arms of Christopher Draisfield: "Gules, a chevron raguly of two bastons couped at the top argent."

The arms of Zodwa Special School for Severely Mentally Handicapped Children show a chevron dovetailed, the peak ensigned with a potent issuant''.

Some examples also exist of ''urdy,'' where the line is in the shapes of the upside-down and rightside-up "shields" of [[vair]] (this is to be distinguished from ''couped urdy'', in which the couping takes a pointed form [https://web.archive.org/web/20060507150804/http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/MP/231MilitaryPoliceBattalion.htm]).  The arms of Winfried Paul Reinhold Steinhagen are ''Per chevron, the peak in the form of a merlon round urdy of four, Gules and Or, in chief a horse forcene and a goat clymant respecting one another, Argent, and in base a bull's head Sable armed Argent; a chief per fess in the form of a wall with three watchtowers, Azure and Argent, the latter charged with a strand of barbed wire throughout, Sable''.  The "unusual, if not unique" arms of Lourens Du Toit are ''Per fess of three pallets urdy Sable and Or''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091926/http://sahw.bravehost.com/p-pers2.htm]

The arms of the [[Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20060819090850/http://www.racds.org/college/college_arms] have a bordure emblazoned "dentate," although this appears to be quite similar to dovetailed.

== Embowed, nowy and variants ==

A line ''embowed'' consists of a single arch.

A line ''nowy'' contains a semicircular protuberance in the middle. A line with an angular protuberance in the middle, like a battlement, is called ''escartelly''.&lt;ref name="line" /&gt;

The arms of Laerskool Bosveld in South Africa have a field ''Per chevron embowed trefly, Azure and Argent''.

The arms of Léopold-Henri Amyot [http://www.heraldry.ca/arms/a/amyot.htm] show "per fess ogivy"; this is based on the [[ogive]] or [[pointed arch]].

Chiefs, fesses and palar dividing lines are sometimes seen ''arched'' and ''double-arched'' (and there is an example of triple-arched), though there is some debate as to whether or not these are lines of partition.  That arched can be combined with partition lines can be seen from the [http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/scot/slanks.htm arms] of [[South Lanarkshire]] in [[Scotland]].  Arched can also be ''reversed''.

== Rarer lines and recent inventions ==
[[File:Kainuu.vaakuna.svg|thumb|150px|Fir-tree topped line (''kuusikoro'') in [[Kainuu]] coat of arms.]]
The rare line ''bevilled'' modifies the bendlets in [https://web.archive.org/web/20040409072740/http://www.whitelionsociety.org.uk/Slidesandblazon/WLS%20Armorial/Slide94.GIF the arms of Thomas Roy Barnes] and the pairle in the arms of [[Rovaniemi]], Finland.  This lightning-bolt type of line with one zigzag is to be distinguished from ''angled'', in which the line takes a 90-degree upwards turn before another 90-degree turn, continuing parallel and in the same direction from the old line.  There is a South African example of ''bevilled to sinister'', and a bend ''double bevilled'' can be seen in the arms of Philip Kushlick School.

A line ''trefly'' shows protuberances in the form of trefoils.

The arms of St. Paul's Cathedral in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]] contain a bordure ''its inner line looping in foils of poplar of the field within the bordure at each angle and at regular intervals between''.[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090908173201/http://www.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project-pic.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=582&amp;ProjectElementID=2051]

The arms of Carmichael show a fess "wreathy," which may or may not be strictly speaking a line of partition, but it does modify the fess; the coat is not blazoned as a "wreath in fess".  James Parker calls this "tortilly."

The 20th century saw some innovations in lines of partition.  ''Erablé'', a series of alternating upside-down and rightside-up maple-leaves, is a typically [[Canada|Canadian]] line of partition, though the [[College of Arms]] in London has used it in a few grants (but compare the cross ''nowy erablé'' in the arms of Katherina Fahlman Selinger Schaaf.[http://reg.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=569]  A [[Finland|Finnish]] line of partition, invented by Kaj Cajander and called ''kuusikoro,'' which is called ''fir-tree topped'' in Britain, and which the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] coined the term ''sapiné'' to blazon, resembles fir trees; in the arms of [[Guy Selvester]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20040830105936/http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/guyselvester.htm] this is called ''sapinage''.  A line resembling fir twigs, and so called in British blazon, is called ''sapinagy'' in Canada (though sadly there is no example of it in the online Canadian Public Register), and ''havukoro'' in Finland.[http://www.baronage.co.uk/2002d/appleton.pdf])  Other 20th-century examples of lines, or things akin to lines, include the 1990 grant to [[Albersdorf-Prebuch]], also in Austria, in which the upper line of the fess takes the form of [[fruit]], the bottom of [[vine-leaves]].  (It is debatable what the distinction is between such lines, and examples such as the [http://www.ngw.nl/int/oos/b/bierbaum.htm arms] of [[Bierbaum am Auersbach]], a town in [[Styria]], in which three pears grow from a [[pall (heraldry)|pall]].)

The South African [[Bureau of Heraldry]] has developed the line of partition ''serpentine''(which has also been called 'ondoyant'), which is rather like wavy, but with only one "wave", one complete cycle of a sine wave; the serpentine in the arms of the Mtubatuba Primary School is defined as "dexter to chief and sinister to base".  (Similar is the German "im Schlangenschnitt" (snake-wise).)  It has also developed the uniquely South-African lines of division (which can also form the ends of a charge) ''nowy of a Cape Town gable'' (now called just ''nowy gabled''),[http://www.baronage.co.uk/2002d/appleton.pdf] and ''nowy of an Indian cupola.'' Similarly, the fess line in the arms of the Council for Social and Associated Workers is ''nowy of a trimount inverted'', the fess in the arms of Mossel Bay is ''nowy of two Karoo gable houses'', the chief in the arms of the Lenasia South-East Management Committee is ''nowy of an Indian cupola'', the chief in the arms of the Genealogical Society of South Africa is ''double nowy gably'' and that of Frederick Brownell is ''gably of three''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091949/http://sahw.bravehost.com/h-who.htm]  The arms of the Reyneke Bond (i.e. Reyneke Family Association) are ''Per fess, in each flank double nowy fitchy to base, Azure and Or, a lion rampant per fess of the second and Gules, a chief Or''.  The plain chief identifies these as the arms of a family association.  The arms of Itsokolele, South Africa include ''a chief double fitchy inverted''.

''Broad fitchy couped'' is a line of South-African origin similar in appearance to a mine-dump or escartelly with sloping sides.[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708091915/http://sahw.bravehost.com/e-des.htm]

Chevrons can be topped with a fleur-de-lys, and ordinaries with non-straight edges (particularly if they are dancetty or engrailed) can have the points topped with demi fleurs-de-lys.  It has sometimes been said that in some reference works flory-counter-flory (and flory) is treated like a line of partition, even though strictly speaking it is not – though it has been used for centuries that way in the royal arms of Scotland blazoning the double tressure (Public Register of Arms, Lyon Court, Edinburgh) and used by the College of arms in blazoning coats like that of Sutherland of Dunstanburgh Castle (Gules, a chevron flory-counterflory between in chief three mullets and in base a lymphad all or) and is used by the South African Bureau of Heraldry blazoning the coat of Huis Tankotie of the University of Pretoria (Per fess, flory counter-flory, Argent and Azure, in base within the flower an annulet Sable;  a  bordure counterchanged)and Emmanuel-Opleidingsentrum in the South African Bureau of Heraldry's online database. (Flory is sometimes varied with other shapes than the fleur-de-lys, when it is blazoned as ''flory of''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20041227071419/http://www.theheraldrysociety.com/resources/michaelmctiernan.htm])

A vague and unhelpful blazon of the 27th Air Division of the [[United States Air Force]][https://web.archive.org/web/20121024010340/http://www.afhra.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=10080] provides for a "bordure of distinctive outline".

==Career==

===As artist===
Venieri is well known for her evocative sculpture installations which bridge mythology with current events, and for her ability to combine humor with self-reflection on human conditions in our times, through her characters that are taken from mythology, history, fairy tales and daily life. In her stories dreams reinforce reality and reality reinforce dreams.

The provocative visualizations of the universe of Venieri's work offer a Potnian statement about the world in flux in which we live.

She has had many exhibitions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.industrynews.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4402%3Alola-nikolaou-art-gallery-1310-1211-&amp;catid=122%3Aellada&amp;Itemid=315 |title=Account Suspended |publisher=Industrynews.gr |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stuxgallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuxgallery.com/site/www/artist_gallery/27|title=The Last Conflict, Stux Gallery, New York|publisher=Stux Gallery.com|accessdate=2012-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306213458/http://www.stuxgallery.com/site/www/artist_gallery/27|archivedate=2012-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="melt.gr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melt.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=134&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en|title=The Bathhouse of the Winds, Athens|publisher=Melt.gr|date=2011-02-27|accessdate=2012-08-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321111959/http://www.melt.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=134&amp;Itemid=2&amp;lang=en|archivedate=2012-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been noted as;

{{blockquote|"Lydia Venieri erects entire mythologies and symbolic systems from the already phantasmagoric world of news media. Her stories are played out using dolls and childlike imagery to counter media dementia, in painting, drawing, photography, video and the internet. Theogony explicates Venieri's universe surveying two decades of work; work of one of the most celebrated and visionary Greek artists of our time."&lt;ref name="artonair"/&gt;}}

She currently shows with [[Stux Gallery]] in New York, Gallery Quang in Paris, Galleri S.E in Norway, Tokyo Terra in Japan and Gallery Isabel Aninat in Chile.

The '''''Mese''''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|ἡ Μέση [Ὀδός]}}}} ''i Mése [Odós]'', lit. "Middle [Street]") was the main thoroughfare of ancient [[Constantinople]]. The street was the main scene of Byzantine imperial processions. Its ancient course is largely followed by the modern Divanyolu Avenue.

== Description ==
The ''Mese'' started at the [[Milion]] monument, close to the [[Hagia Sophia]], and led straight westwards. It passed the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]] and the palaces of [[Palace of Lausus|Lausos]] and [[Palace of Antiochos|Antiochus]], and after ca. 600 meters reached the oval-shaped [[Forum of Constantine]] where one of the city's two [[Byzantine Senate|Senate houses]] stood. This stretch of the street was also known as the '''''Regia''''' ({{lang|grc|ἡ Ῥηγία}}, "Imperial Road"), as it formed the original ceremonial route from the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]] and the [[Augustaion]] square to the forum of the city's founder.

From there, the street continued to the square [[Forum of Theodosius]] or Forum of the Bull (''Forum Tauri''), as it was also known. In about the middle of this stretch, the great [[esplanade|mall]] known as ''Makros Embolos'' joined the ''Mese''. At their junction stood a ''[[tetrapylon]]'' known as the ''Anemodoulion'' ("Servant of the winds").

Shortly after it passed the Theodosian Forum, the street divided in two branches at the site of the Capitolium: one branch going northwest, passing by the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], towards the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Gate of Polyandrion]], while the other continued southwest, through the [[Forum of the Ox]] (Forum Bovis) and the [[Forum of Arcadius]] towards the [[Golden Gate (Constantinople)|Golden Gate]], where it joined the ''[[Via Egnatia]]''.

The ''Mese'' was 25 metres wide and lined with colonnaded [[portico]]es which housed shops. The ''Mese'' was the route followed by imperial processions through the city at least until [[Comneni]]an times. The most characteristic was the triumphal entry of a victorious emperor, who entered the city through the Golden Gate and followed the ''Mese'' to the [[Great Palace of Constantinople|Great Palace]], while jubilant crowds lined along the street would greet him and the imperial army back home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12352">'''Myrlande Constant''' is a Haitian and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] artist who was born in 1968. Constant is married and the mother of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indigoarts.com/artist/myrlande-constant|title=Myrlande Constant|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2015|website=Indigo Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Constant was born in [[Port-au-Prince]] in [[Haiti]] where, as a teenager, she learned the art of beading while working with her mother in a Port-au-Prince factory making wedding dresses. Once she quit that job she moved on to be one of the most celebrated artists for making Vodou drapo.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"&gt;Donald J.Cosentino, and Edwidge Danticat, ''In Extremis: Death and Life in 21st-century Haitian Art,'' (Los Angeles, CA: Fowler Museum at UCLA, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.183}} Constant has taken part in the revolution in the art of drapo-making over the last two decades. She has been making flags since the 1900s. Since the 1900s, there was an abrupt shift in drapo-making, which was primarily a male art form. There are several new designers who are women now, one of them being Myrlande Constant. Because of the impact that Constant has on other people, she influences art making in other individuals, in particular [[Marilyn Houlberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Cosentino, "Bicentennial blues," ''African Arts'' 37, no. 3 (2004), 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant bears witness to her nation's calamities. For example, after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the artwork Myrlande made represented the collectivistic society through the things that were going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}

Her works are densely beaded flags (some as large as six by seven feet). Constant’s flags are much larger than traditional flags. In 2011, Constant participated in a series of exhibitions, workshops, and lectures at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] where she conducted a three-day flag-making workshop.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.183}}

== Principal expositions and works ==
Myrlande Constant had her first sale to Richard A Morse, who was the manager of the Oloffson Hotel in Port-au-Prince. Other subsequent sales of her outstanding Vodou flags were made through the connections of her husband, Charles, who convinced customers and visitors at the hotel to buy her work. Many of Constant’s inspiration of her artwork came from her father who is a Vodou priest and Christian. She states that she has no one to thank but the spirits and God before the spirits. She additionally states that the mystical feelings and aspirations come from her thoughts.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}} Everything she puts on a flag is there for a reason because the spirit keeps her working. Constant is also inspired by Milo Rigaud’s landmark book called ''Veve''. This book contains symbolic drawings of spirits made on Vodou temple floors. Constant uses that inspiration to remember her memories of Vodou ceremonies and knowledge of the spirits to create her own design in the flags.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}}

The main process of the making of her flags starts with pencil drawings on white cloth. Second, she sews the sequins and beads to the cloth. Lastly, she incorporates the colors that associate with the spirits. Typically, most of her works are as large as bedspreads depicting various significant events in Vodou and Haitian history through using needle, thread, cloth, and tiny adornments.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}}

Constant is particularly a well known Haitian and Vodou artist in many parts of the world. Specifically, her piece of the 2010 Haiti earthquake apocalypse was recognized as an immediate potential for becoming one of the 2011 Ghetto Biennale Exhibition in [[New York (state)|New York]]’s most extreme and powerful artistic visions.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

'''''Haiti madi 12 januye 2010''''' (Haiti Tuesday, January 12, 2010)

239 x 249 cm

Private collection

This piece of artwork is made with fabric, beads, and sequins. Myrlande Constant’s tableau depicts the ruins and aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. It was funded by the [[Fowler Museum at UCLA|Fowler Museum]] with funds provided by the Fay Bettye Green Fund to Commission New Work. This piece makes the viewer feel the need to study the miseries and disasters that happen in the human life. The chaoticness of the imagery resembles how chaotic the actual event was in 2010. The visual characteristics include a border of crossbones and skulls, and angels and God looking down on the situation resembling the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of dry bones: “The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of the valley, it was full of bones. [[Ezekiel]] 37:1).” Other aspects of this piece include homes, churches, and vodou temples all being reduced to rubble. Dogs and pigs gnaw on the unburied unprotected human remains. The Catholic Archbishop Serge Miot, who is a man of [[God]], lies dead under the fallen roof of his cathedral with a hand on a bible. Other individuals in the piece are shown as Vodouists who either carry a child in their arms, or wheelbarrow the dead and wounded to the appropriate destinations as a summoning mortal to the hand of their maker in the call of Gabriel. More individuals either pick up the ruins, or sink to the ground as if remaining upright on solid earth is not an option. Constant’s piece depicted a meaning that explained the suffering as ultimately, just as with life, letting death go on. Looking forward to Ash Wednesday being faithful, and having anticipation on Eastertide’s Resurrection were things that Constant reminded the victims of. The victims were shown “Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return”. And so, too the Gede will rise up to their feet, shake off the dirt, adjust their glasses, straighten their hats, grab their canes and crutches, and dance.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.141}}

'''''Nictoglobe''''' is an online art [[magazine]]. Its international contributors are working in arts related fields, such as (digital) writing, painting, poetry and [[activism]]. ''Nictoglobe'' is edited and published by A. Andreas (Andreas Maria Jacobs) who was born in the Netherlands in 1956.

== Early years ==
''Nictoglobe'' started sometime in 1982 as a stenciled paper, exclusively and privately distributed on the local night bus service in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nictoglobe.com/new/2007/center.html Origins]. Retrieved November 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of these first printings are available at the [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISG) in Amsterdam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iisg.nl/~staatsarchief/periodieken/fanzines.php#nictoglobe IISG, Amsterdam NL]&lt;/ref&gt; The printed edition was followed up by electronic editions on [[Bulletin Board Systems]]. Later editions were put on [[MSXII]] systems, and finally on TeleText modules.

== Internet era ==
With the arrival of [[ARPAnet]] in Europe in the late 80s, new editions were placed on the Internet. New collaborations include the 'Ey Ar' shows and the founding of the Brahamian Intelligence Service in 2004.

In summer 2007, Nictoglobe organized @ De Balie - Centre for Culture and Politics, Amsterdam, using free publicly accessible open source software tools, developed and provided by de Balie, a DIY CoolMediaHotTalkShow about 'Creative Resistance, New Media as Soft Arms'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.debalie.nl/artikel.jsp?articleid=180802 De Balie - Centre for Culture and Politics, Amsterdam]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other projects ==

Nictoglobe created '''La Resocialista Internacional''' a poetical multi-lingual website which also goes under the original Dutch title: '''[http://Burgerwaanzin.nl Burgerwaanzin.nl]'''. This project gained some global attention expressed by its inclusion in new media festivals a.o File Festival São Paulo (2011), File Rio (2012), Brazil and the European Anthology of Electronic Writing, ELMCIP Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden (2012)

The netart project  '''Semantic Disturbances''' (2007  - 2012), included in different new-media art related periodicals: Web del Sol, US, Hyperrhiz, US and collections such as Runme.org UK, Rhizome's Artbase, US and the Electronic Literature Collection Volume 2, Electronic Literature Organization US (2010)

'''11 Ways to escape the symbolic Field''', experimental electronic poems using internet driven imagery was featured at ISEA 2012 in Albuquerque, New Mexico US after its first live performance at Stichting Perdu Amsterdam (2011) and will be featured at the ELO Conference/Festival Chercher le Texte in Paris, France (2013)

==Friction Research==

Nictoglobe publishes (almost) yearly a themed special on new media practices, ''Friction Research''.

{{Punctuation marks|※|caption=reference mark}}

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.
* To attribute a quote or viewpoint.

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125141230/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb The Cobweb]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 26 January 2015 issue. Retrieved 25 January 2015. Archived from [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb the original].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.
*[[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' uses footnotes to insert comical remarks and explanations by one of the protagonists, Bartimaeus.
*[[Michael Gerber (parodist)|Michael Gerber]]'s ''[[Barry Trotter]]'' parody series used footnotes to expand [[one-line joke]]s in the text into paragraph-long comedic monologues that would otherwise break the flow of the narrative.
*[[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]'' uses footnotes in which he says: "[They] can allow you to create a kind of secret second narrative, which is important if, say, you're writing a book about what a story is and whether stories are significant."{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Dr Carol Bolton uses extensive footnotes to provide the modern reader with a cipher for a novel about the travels of the fictional Spanish traveller [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275996974_Through_Spanish_Eyes_Robert_Southey's_Double_Vision_in_Letters_from_England_By_Don_Manuel_Alvarez_Espriella_%281807%29 Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella], an early 19th-century construct of Robert Southey's, designed to provide him with vehicle to critique the societal habits of the day.
*[[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series exploits the use of footnotes as a communication device (the ''footnoterphone'') which allows communication between the main character’s universe and the fictional bookworld.
*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration. As the editor of his father's autobiography, the narrator's son must correct any of his father's misstated facts. The frequency of these corrections increases as the father falls victim to both hubris and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. While most of these changes are minor, a few are essential to plot and character development.
*In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the main plot is told through the annotative endnotes of a fictional editor.
*''[[Bartleby y Compañía]],'' a novel by [[Enrique Vila-Matas]], is stylized as footnotes to a nonexistent novel.
*The works of [[Jack Vance]] often have footnotes, detailing and informing the reader of the background of the world in the novel.
*[[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' uses both footnotes and margin notes to offer additional commentary and humor.
*[[Doug Dorst]]'s novel ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' uses footnotes to explore the story and relationship of characters V.M. Straka and F.X. Caldeira.

An '''Objects conservator''' is a professional, working in a [[museum]] setting or private practice, that specializes in the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of three-dimensional works.  They undergo specialized education, training, and experience that allows them to formulate and implement preventative strategies and invasive treatment protocols to preserve cultural property for the future.&lt;ref name="AIC Definitions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of Conservation Terminology|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/definitions#.Uwy7NvldV8E/|work=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Objects conservators typically specialize in one type of material or class of cultural property, including metals, [[archaeological artifacts]], [[ethnographic]] artifacts, glass, and [[ceramic art]].  Objects conservation presents many challenges due to their three-dimensional form and composite nature.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The diverse nature of artifacts that fall into the category of three dimensional objects presents a unique challenge to compiling a set of common procedures.  However, preventative measures and treatment methodologies involve similar considerations that need to be addressed, regardless of the object's composition.  In the words of Cesare Brandi, "Restoration must aim to reestablish the potential unity of the work of art, as long as this is possible without producing an artistic or historical forgery and without erasing every trace of the passage of time left on the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical and Philosophical Issues in the Conservation of Cultural Heritage|date=1996|publisher=Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA|isbn=978-0-892363-98-8|editor=Price, N. |editor2=Talley Jr. M. K. |editor3=Vaccaro, A. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  This means that an Objects Conservator needs to know when to draw the line, and communicate that limit to the object's custodian.

===Preventative Measures===
[[File:IMA Objects conservator 3.jpg|thumb|left|Mallory Marty prepares an object to be moved  at the Indianapolis Museum of Art to prevent damage while in transit.]]
While not as glamorous or hands-on as the other steps in this process, collections care, or [[Preventive conservation|preventative conservation]], is arguably the most important.  To truly preserve cultural heritage for the future, it is imperative to minimize deterioration by developing and implementing procedures to minimize the amount of physical and chemical stress an object encounters.  This includes its environmental conditions (relative humidity, temperature, exposure to light), [[integrated pest management]] protocols,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Integrated Pest MAnagement|url=http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/3.-emergency-management/3.10-integrated-pest-management|work=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; use of specialized storage containers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Housing a Collection of Artifacts Representing American Cultural Traditions|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/conservators/legacies/3D.html|work=Library of Congress|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for packing and shipping, exhibition conditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental and Display Guidelines for Paintings and Polychrome Sculptures|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/10-4-eng.aspx|work=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Emergency response (museum)|emergency preparedness plan]].  The initial expense of such measures often causes institutions and private collectors to balk, but in comparison to the expense of the invasive treatments that will be needed if one does not take such preventative measures, the benefit outweighs the initial investment.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-1-933253-15-2|edition=5|editor=Buck, R. |editor2=Gilmore, J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preventative conservation is also something that a private collector can implement for their own pieces.  Controlling the amount of light an object is exposed to, the source of illumination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum Lighting Research Lighting Case Studies|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/lighting/case.html|work=Getty Conservation Institute|accessdate=April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ambient temperature of its environment, and protecting it from rapid changes in relative humidity goes a long way towards ensuring that an object will be around to pass down to future generations.

===Treatment Protocol===

While each object is unique, conservators begin with a similar process regardless of the artifact being assessed.   A Conservator may need to stabilize an object at any stage in the process to prevent further loss, or, in extreme cases, begin by stabilizing an object before further examination can occur.  Documentation takes place during every step of treatment, including: original condition, sample sites (if taken), different types of damage, areas of significant weakness before and after stabilization, and potential infestation sites.  It is also important to document the objects condition before and after moving it, especially in the case of off-site transport.  The ultimate goal of treatment is to preserve both the physical object and its interpretation, or cultural context.&lt;ref name="Barbara Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=San Bernardino, CA|isbn=978-1-453682-11-1|author=Barbara Appelbaum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Examination====
The first step of any treatment protocol is a thorough examination of the object.  This includes both its physical components and its cultural importance.  Physical components include the materials used, its construction, and the appearance of the object's surface.  The conservator often employs different techniques for this portion of the examination, including photographs taken in different light conditions such as visible, raking, and Ultraviolet to examine the surface, and x-rays to reveal the structure within.  Cultural significance is more challenging to determine, including the object's meaning, function, intended use, and importance to society.

Thorough examination and research allows the Conservator to reconstruct an object's history and, together with the object's custodian (the owner, a [[curator]], [[Registrar (museum)|registrar]], or [[collection manager]]) determine the object's ideal state and determine a realistic treatment goal.&lt;ref name="Barbara Appelbaum"/&gt;
[[File:IMA Objects conservator 1.jpg|thumb|Laura Kubick treats an object at the Indianapolis Museum of Art]]

====Treatment====
Following examination the Conservator will prepare a pre-treatment report that discusses the treatment goal for the object and the planned course of action.  As defined by AIC, treatment is "The deliberate alteration of the chemical and/or physical aspects of cultural property, aimed primarily at prolonging its existence.&lt;ref name="AIC Definitions"/&gt;" This can be something as minimal as reinforcing flaking paint, or something as complex as the migration of metals and salts through a wooden statue, leading to loss of strength, shrinkage, separation between the wooden support, metal fastenings, and decorative outer surface.

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
Objects Conservators must be an expert collaborator, working with members of the public and museum professionals alike. Conservation is not a vacuum and practitioners collaborate with colleagues around the world, lending expertise and receiving guidance.  They need to advocate for the object, explain their treatment protocol, the importance of preventative measures, and stand firm when asked to reconsider a "no". They must also be open to alternate interpretations, have an understanding of different materials and construction techniques,keen observation skills, and deft hands.

==Education &amp; training==

Most museums and prestigious private firms require graduate degrees in Conservation.  Without graduate level education, knowledge of chemistry, hands-on experience, and a thorough foundation in documentation, evaluation, and treatment an institution or firm is taking a serious risk.  Anyone can call themselves a conservator, but it is the specialized training gained through graduate programs or similar experiences that count.

Gaining admission to a conservation graduate program includes an undergraduate degree, a concentration in chemistry (specifically organic chemistry), and a significant number of hours working under a trained Conservator.  This ensures that the candidate has a through foundation upon which to build and is already familiar with many aspects of the process.

'''''Odd and the Frost Giants''''' ([[2008 in literature|2008]]) is a [[World Book Day]] book by [[Neil Gaiman]]. It draws on [[Norse mythology]] and also the historical [[Viking]]s.

== Plot summary ==
Odd is a young Norseman whose father, a woodcutter, drowned during a Viking raid. His Scottish mother marries a fat widower who neglects him in favor of his own children, and when soon after the winter drags on unnaturally long, Odd leaves his village for the forest. There he meets a fox, an eagle and a bear, the latter with its paw trapped in a tree. Odd aids the bear, and learns that these are not normal animals, but the gods [[Loki]], [[Odin]] and [[Thor]]. The gods have been transformed and cast out of [[Asgard]] by a [[Jötunn|Frost Giant]] who tricked Loki into giving him [[Mjolnir|Thor's hammer]] by taking the form of a woman, granting him rule over Asgard and causing the endless winter.

Deciding to help the stranded gods, Odd travels with them to Asgard. There, Thor leads him to [[Mimir's Well]], and he receives wisdom and a vision of his parents in their youth. He eventually speaks with the Giant, who reveals his brother built the walls of Asgard but was tricked out of payment and killed by Thor. Odd convinces the Giant to return home. In return, the goddess [[Freyja/Freya]] heals his leg, though she cannot mend it completely, and Odin gives him a staff. He returns to [[Midgard]], somewhat bigger than when he left due to drinking from Mimir's Well, and as the winter ends he reunites with his mother.

'''''Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore''''' is a book on [[Abanindranath Tagore]]'s paintings by art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]].&lt;ref name="amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=9788189323097|title=Amazon.com: Paintings Of Abanindranath Tagore: R. Siva Kumar: Books|publisher=amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered as a landmark book in the Indian art scene that brings together a large corpus of [[Abanindranath]]'s work for the first time. It fulfils a glaring lacuna in the picture of this master of modern Indian art.

In the books [[R. Siva Kumar]] states, 'The social space that Abanindranath narrativized as an artist-flaneur is thus the subject of the Orientalist artist/writer read from the obverse. He reclaims the colonial subjects' right to narrate their stories that was arrogated to themselves by the colonial rulers and perpetuated by presenting their readings as 'objective'. Abanindranath reasserts this right by recasting the Nights ([[Arabian Nights]]), a text central to the Orientalist representation of the East, by urging us to read his act of imagination contrapuntally with the text authenticated by the Orientalist.'&lt;ref name="artnewsnviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnewsnviews.com/view-article.php?article=abanindranath-tagore-a-reappraisal-&amp;iid=22&amp;articleid=556|title=Abanindranath Tagore: a reappraisal|publisher=artnewsnviews.com|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951) is a singular figure in [[Modern Indian painting|Modern Indian Art]]. Having arrived on the [[Indian art]] scene with the first wave of nationalism, he was seen as father figure of nationalist art and modernism. Along with [[E. B. Havell]], [[Ananda Coomaraswamy|Coomaraswamy]], [[Sister Nivedita]] and other nationalists he brought an attitudinal change in the Indian response to traditional art. But his true contribution went beyond these. Trained under European artists initially, realism remained the underpinning of his work. But as a modernist at heart who was guided more by his sensibility than his training, he transformed the post Renaissance academic realism into which he was trained with his series of contacts with oriental art into something more supple and responsive to the imaginative flights of his mind. A post-Romantic in his sensibilities, he let his individualism triumph over his nationalism. Although he aligned with the nationalists in the early years of his career he transcended it very soon to develop something more akin to a [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelairian]] aesthetics of modernism with a subjective response to the world rather than an unmediated representation of things. His most impressive work, the Arabian Nights series painted in 1930, can be described as a look at his immediate world through the eyes of a [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelarian]] [[Flâneur|Flaneur]], with the stories of the Arabian Nights serving as a pre-text. Equally original as a writer, [[Abanindranath]] is a phenomenon whose import has not been fully grasped. Much of this has been due to the unfamiliarity with his work in the absence of easily accessible public collections and publications. The present book brings together a large body of his work for the first time in an attempt to fulfill a glaring lacuna in our picture of this early master of modern Indian art.&lt;ref name="pratikshanbooks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/index.html|title=Pratikshan :: Books in Books On Art|publisher=pratikshanbooks.com|accessdate=2014-12-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302123621/http://www.pratikshanbooks.com/booksonart/index.html|archivedate=2014-03-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has also influenced other books and researches on [[Abanindranath Tagore]]. [[Ananya Vajpeyi]] in her ''Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India'' highlights the contribution of [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s ''Paintings of Abanindranath Tagore'' in foregrounding [[Abanindranath Tagore]]'s  art anew.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Righteous Republic: The Political Foundations of Modern India|author=Vajpeyi, A.|date=2012|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674067288|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=knCDsvJYy1EC|page=279|accessdate=2014-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''portrait''' is a [[portrait painting|painting]], [[portrait photography|photograph]], [[sculpture]], or other artistic representation of a person, in which the face and its expression is predominant. The intent is to display the likeness, [[Personality type|personality]], and even the mood of the person. For this reason, in photography a portrait is generally not a [[Snapshot (photography)|snapshot]], but a composed image of a person in a still position. A portrait often shows a person looking directly at the painter or photographer, in order to most successfully engage the subject with the viewer.

==History==
{{main article|Portrait painting}}
[[File:Fayum02.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman-Egyptian [[Fayum mummy portraits|funeral portrait]] of a young boy]]
[[File:MochePortrait.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Moche culture|Moche]] ceramic portrait. [[Larco Museum]] Collection. Lima-Peru]]
Most early representations that are clearly intended to show an individual are of rulers, and tend to follow idealizing artistic conventions, rather than the individual features of the subject's body, though when there is no other evidence as to the ruler's appearance the degree of idealization can be hard to assess.  Nonetheless, many subjects, such as [[Akhenaten]] and some other Egyptian [[pharaoh]]s, can be recognised by their distinctive features. The 28 surviving rather small [[statues of Gudea]], ruler of [[Lagash]] in [[Sumeria]] between c. 2144 - 2124 BC, show a consistent appearance with some individuality.

Some of the earliest surviving painted portraits of people who were not rulers are the Greco-Roman [[Fayum mummy portraits|funeral portraits]] that survived in the dry climate of Egypt's [[Fayum]] district. These are almost the only paintings from the classical world that have survived, apart from [[fresco]]s, though many sculptures and portraits on coins have fared better.  Although the appearance of the figures differs considerably, they are considerably idealized, and all show relatively young people, making it uncertain whether they were painted from life.

The art of the portrait flourished in Ancient Greek and especially [[Roman sculpture]], where sitters demanded individualized and realistic portraits, even unflattering ones. During the 4th century, the portrait began to retreat in favor of an idealized symbol of what that person looked like. (Compare the portraits of Roman Emperors [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine I]] and [[Theodosius I]] at their entries.) In the [[Europe]] of the [[Early Middle Ages]] representations of individuals are mostly generalized.  True portraits of the outward appearance of individuals re-emerged in the late [[Middle Ages]], in [[tomb monument]]s, [[donor portrait]]s, miniatures in [[illuminated manuscript]]s and then [[panel painting]]s.

[[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture of Peru was one of the few ancient civilizations which produced portraits. These works accurately represent anatomical features in great detail. The individuals portrayed would have been recognizable without the need for other symbols or a written reference to their names. The individuals portrayed were members of the ruling elite, priests, warriors and even distinguished artisans.&lt;ref&gt;Donnan, Christopher B. ''Moche Portraits from Ancient Peru'' University of Texas Press, 2004. {{ISBN|0-292-71622-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  They were represented during several stages of their lives. The faces of gods were also depicted. To date, no portraits of women have been found. There is particular emphasis on the representation of the details of headdresses, hairstyles, body adornment and face painting.

One of the best-known portraits in the Western world is [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s painting titled ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', which is a painting of [[Lisa del Giocondo]]. What has been claimed as the world's oldest known portrait was found in 2006 in the [[Vilhonneur]] grotto near [[Angoulême]] and is thought to be 27,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jun/06/art | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Jonathan | last=Jones | title=Old masters | date=6 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cave face 'the oldest portrait on record' |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2211142,00.html |publisher=The Times |date=5 June 2006 |accessdate=2008-01-04 |location=London |first=Adam |last=Sage |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724131845/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2211142,00.html |archivedate=July 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-portraiture==
[[File:Maria Razumovskaya by Vigée-Lebrun.jpg|thumb|upright|Late 18th Century portrait by [[Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun]]]]
{{main article|Self-portrait}}
When the artist creates a portrait of him- or herself, it is called a ''self-portrait''. Identifiable examples become numerous in the late Middle Ages. But if the definition is extended, the first was by the [[Egypt]]ian [[Pharaoh]] [[Akhenaten]]'s sculptor Bak, who carved a representation of himself and his wife Taheri c. 1365 BC. However, it seems likely that self-portraits go back to the [[cave paintings]], the earliest representational art, and literature records several classical examples that are now lost.

==Official portrait==

The official portrait is a photographic production of record and dissemination of important personalities, notably kings, presidents and governors. It is usually decorated with official colors and symbols such as flag, presidential stripes and coat of arms of countries, states or municipalities. There is also connotation as an image of events, products and meetings&lt;ref&gt;Portuguese Almanac of Photography, 1957 edition, Mário Nogueira. [[Lisbon]], Portugal, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Portrait photography==
{{main article|Portrait photography}}

Portrait photography is a popular commercial industry all over the world. Many people enjoy having professionally made ''family portraits'' to hang in their homes, or special portraits to commemorate certain events, such as graduations or weddings.
[[File:DSC 7424 (34067852616).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A portrait of a family]]
Since the dawn of photography, people have made portraits. The popularity of the [[daguerreotype]] in the middle of the 19th century was due in large part to the demand for inexpensive portraiture. Studios sprang up in cities around the world, some cranking out more than 500 plates a day. The style of these early works reflected the technical challenges associated with 30-second exposure times and the [[painterly]] aesthetic of the time. Subjects were generally seated against plain backgrounds and lit with the soft light of an overhead window and whatever else could be reflected with mirrors.

As photographic techniques developed, an intrepid group of photographers took their talents out of the studio and onto battlefields, across oceans and into remote wilderness. [[William Shew]]'s ''Daguerreotype Saloon'', [[Roger Fenton]]'s ''Photographic Van'' and [[Mathew Brady]]'s ''What-is-it?'' wagon set the standards for making portraits and other photographs in the field.

==Politics==
In [[politics]], portraits of the leader are often used as a [[symbol]] of the [[Sovereign state|state]]. In most countries it is common protocol for a portrait of the [[head of state]] to appear in important [[government]] buildings. Excessive use of a leader's portrait, such as that done of [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], or [[Mao Zedong]], can be indicative of a [[personality cult]].

==Literature==
{{main article|Portrait (literature)}}
In [[literature]] the term ''portrait'' refers to a written description or analysis of a person or thing. A written portrait often gives deep insight, and offers an analysis that goes far beyond the superficial. For example, American author [[Patricia Cornwell]] wrote a best-selling book entitled ''[[Portrait of a Killer]]'' about the personality, background, and possible motivations of [[Jack the Ripper]], as well as the media coverage of his murders, and the subsequent police investigation of his crimes.

'''Qalandiya International''' is a contemporary art event and [[biennale]] that takes place every two years across Palestinian cities and villages. Founded in 2012, it brings together Palestinian and international art and culture organizations in collaboration to produce exhibitions, performances, talks, film screenings, workshops, and tours.

QI coincides with and incorporates The Jerusalem Show, a cultural event organized by the Al-Ma’mal Foundation and centered in the Old City, and the Young Artist of the Year Award (YAYA), organized by the [[A. M. Qattan Foundation]] and given every two years to a Palestinian artist under the age of 30.

== History ==

=== QI 2012 ===
The inaugural Qalandiya International was conceived as a way to create an infrastructure that supported cultural practice across Palestine and the diaspora.  It took place from 1–15 November 2012 under the title ''Art and Life in Palestine'', and was co- produced by the Al-Ma’mal Foundation for Contemporary Art in Jerusalem (which had been producing The Jerusalem Show since 2007), Al Hoash- Palestinian Art Court, the International Academy of Art- Palestine, A. M. Qattan Foundation, Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, and [[Riwaq (organization)|RIWAQ]] – Center for Architectural Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/11/201211410554507478.html|title=Biennale seeks to boost Palestinian art|last=Hatuqa|first=Dalia|date=4 November 2012|website=Al Jazeera|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== QI 2014 ===
The second edition of Qalandiya International ran from 22 October- 15 November 2014, under the title ''Archives Lived and Shared.''  [[The Palestinian Museum]] was added as a partner and hosted a documentary survey exhibition, called ‘Introduction to Palestinian Museums.’ Other partners included A. M. Qattan Foundation, Arab Cultural Association, Al Hoash-  Palestinian Art Court, Al- Mashghal, The International Academy of Art- Palestine, Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, RIWAQ – Center for Architectural Conservation, Ramallah Municipality, MinRASY Projects, Eltiqa Group, and Windows for Contemporary Art.

One of the main exhibitions, ‘Manam,’ which was organized by the Arab Cultural Association in Haifa, was unable to host many of its Palestinian participants, who were prevented from attending by the Israeli- imposed system of permits, roadblocks, and checkpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gray|first=Nicola|date=2015|title=Qalandiya International I and II: Cultural Resistance in a Palestinian Biennale|url=|journal=Third Text|volume= 29| issue = 3|pages=165–183|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== QI 2016 ===
The third and latest edition of Qalandiya International took place from 5–30 October 2016 under the title ''This Sea is Mine.'' Addressing themes of exile and return, the program launched with 15 exhibition openings and 80 events, taking place in Haifa, Gaza, Jerusalem, Ramallah and Al-Bireh, Bethlehem, Beirut, Amman, and London.  Participating organizations included A. M. Qattan Foundation, Al Hoash – Palestinian Art Court, Al Ma'mal Foundation for Contemporary Art, Arab Culture Association, Dar Al Kalima, Dar El Nimer, Darat Al Funun, Eltiqa Group, International Academy of Art – Palestine, Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center, MinRASY Projects, Palestine Regeneration Group (PART), Ramallah Municipality, RIWAQ – Center for Architectural Conservation, Shababek for Contemporary Art, and The Palestinian Museum.  Programs extended across a patchwork of venues, including, in addition to QI’s main partners, the Palestinian Child Centre &amp; Youth Activities Centre in Shu’fat Refugee Camp (Jerusalem), Dheisheh Refugee Camp (Bethlehem), Ramallah Recreational Complex, Birzeit University, the Palestinian National Garden, and others.  Programs included ‘O Whale, Don’t Swallow Our Moon,’ a solo exhibition for artist [[Jumana Emil Abboud]] at the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center in Ramallah.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/qalandiya-international-biennial-palestine-686522|title=Qalandiya International: A Multi- City Palestinian Biennial for a Fragmented Territory|last=Buffenstein|first=Alyssa|date=7 October 2016|website=Artnet|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2016/12/artseen/reflections-on-the-sea-is-mine-2016-qalandiya-international-in-palestine|title=Reflections on The Sea is Mine: 2016 Qalandiya International in Palestine|last=Reichert|first=Elliot J.|date=6 December 2016|website=The Brooklyn Rail|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An online full exhibition catalogue for QI2016: ''This Sea is Mine'' was published by [[Ibraaz]] in October 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibraaz.org/publications/79|title=Qalandiya International 2016: This Sea is Mine|website=Ibraaz|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
King was born September 21, 1947, in [[Portland, Maine]]. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a [[merchant navy|merchant seaman]]. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| title= ''[[Finding Your Roots]]''| publisher= PBS| date= September 23, 2014| format= TV documentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.geni.com/people/Donald-King/6000000006574282764|title=Donald Edwin King |work= geni.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= genealogy&gt;[http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/stephen-king/d0/i0000002.htm Ancestry of Stephen King] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061023205329/http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/stephen-king/d0/i0000002.htm |date=October 23, 2006 }} at Genealogy.com. Retrieved August 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; King's mother was Nellie Ruth ([[née]] Pillsbury).&lt;ref name="genealogy" /&gt;

When Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of "going to buy a pack of cigarettes," leaving his mother to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to [[De Pere, Wisconsin]], [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. When King was 11, his family returned to [[Durham, Maine]], where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a [[caregiver]] in a local residential facility for the [[mentally challenged]].&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; King was raised [[Methodist]]&lt;ref name=OfficialFAQ&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.stephenking.com/faq.html#0.5 |title= Frequently Asked Questions| website= StephenKing.com| access-date= October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but lost his belief in organised religion while in high school. While no longer religious, King chooses to believe in the existence of a God.&lt;ref name= guardian&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/29/stephen-king-religion-dangerous-god-exists |title=Stephen King: 'Religion Is a Dangerous Tool... but I Choose to Believe God Exists' |last=Flood |first=Allison |date=October 29, 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher= [[Guardian Media Group]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Beahm| first= George| title= The Stephen King Story: A Literary Profile| publisher= Andrews and McMeel| year= 1991| isbn= 0836279891}}&lt;/ref&gt; but King makes no mention of it in his memoir ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'' (2000).

King related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]'' (1981), in a chapter titled "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause." King compares his uncle's [[dowsing]] for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an [[H. P. Lovecraft]] collection of short stories he remembers as ''The Lurker in the Shadows'', &lt;!-- "The Lurker in the Shadows" doesn't exist and King may mean "The Lurker at the Threshold", but as he says "Shadows" we qualify it by saying that's what he remembers it as.--&gt; that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes &amp; Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, "I knew that I'd found home when I read that book."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ic7JnF4vStA&amp;feature=relmfu |title=Stephen King – Meet the Writers (5:45 into the video) |publisher=YouTube |date=November 3, 2009 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from [[Lisbon Falls High School]], in [[Lisbon Falls, Maine]]. He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of [[EC Comics|EC's horror comics]], including ''[[Tales from the Crypt (comic)|Tales from the Crypt]]'' (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for ''[[Creepshow]]''). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to ''Dave's Rag'', the newspaper his brother published with a [[mimeograph machine]], and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was "I Was a Teenage Grave Robber"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a [[fanzine]], ''Comics Review'', in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as "In a Half-World of Terror" in another fanzine, ''Stories of Suspense'', edited by [[Marv Wolfman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Wood | first=Rocky|title=Stephen King: Uncollected, Unpublished'' | publisher= Cemetery Dance Publications| location=Abingdon, Maryland |year=2006| page=199|isbn= 1-58767-130-1|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teen, King also won a [[Scholastic Art and Writing Awards|Scholastic Art and Writing Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| publisher= Scholastic Inc.| title= America’s Most Creative Teens Named as National 2016 Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards Recipients| url= http://mediaroom.scholastic.com/press-release/america-s-most-creative-teens-named-national-2016-scholastic-art-writing-awards-recipi| date= March 14, 2016 | location= New York City| access-date= January 11, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966, King studied at the [[University of Maine]], graduating in 1970 with a [[Bachelor of Arts#United States|Bachelor of Arts]] in English. That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, ''Steve King's Garbage Truck'', for the student newspaper, ''[[The Maine Campus]]'' and participated in a writing workshop organized by [[Burton Hatlen]].&lt;ref name=bn&gt;{{Cite news|first=Alicia |last=Anstead |title=UM scholar Hatlen, mentor to Stephen King, dies at 71 |url=http://bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=159261&amp;zoneid=17 |newspaper=[[Bangor Daily News]] |date=January 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302041533/http://bangornews.com/news/t/city.aspx?articleid=159261&amp;zoneid=176 |archivedate=March 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry.

==Career==
===Beginnings===
King sold his first professional short story, "The Glass Floor," to ''Startling Mystery Stories'' in 1967.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; The [[Raymond H. Fogler Library|Fogler Library]] at the University of Maine now holds many of King's papers.

After leaving the university, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to [[List of men's magazines|men's magazines]] such as ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]''. Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]''. The short story ''The Raft'' was published in ''Adam'', a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. Luckily payment arrived for the short story ''The Raft'', then entitled ''The Float'', and "all I did was cash the check and pay the fine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=T.E.D.|date=June 1983|title=Cone fever . . .|url=https://archive.org/details/TwilightZoneJune83|journal=Rod Serling's The Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=3|issue=2|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, King married [[Tabitha King|Tabitha Spruce]], a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops.&lt;ref name="bn"/&gt; That fall, King was hired as a teacher at [[Hampden Academy]] in [[Hampden, Maine]]. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; During that time, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Tim|title=The Stephen King interview, uncut and unpublished|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/sep/14/stephenking.fiction|work=The Guardian|date= September 14, 2000|accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, King's first novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]'' was accepted by publishing house [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. King had thrown an early draft of the novel into the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers. His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = King | first1 = Stephen | title = On Writing: A Memoir | place = London (UK) | publisher = [[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]] | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-340-76996-3 | authorlink1 = Stephen King }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}} His advance for ''Carrie'' was $2,500; King's paperback rights later earned $400,000.

King and his family moved to southern [[Maine]] because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled ''Second Coming'', later titled ''Jerusalem's Lot'', before finally changing the title to ''[[Salem's Lot]]'' (published 1975). In a 1987 issue of ''The Highway Patrolman'' magazine, he stated, "The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!"&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin, Phil. [http://americanindian.net/stephenking.html "An Interview with Stephen King"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412115244/https://americanindian.net/stephenking.html |date=April 12, 2014 }}, americanindian.net. Retrieved January 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after ''Carrie''{{'}}s release in 1974, King's mother died of [[uterine cancer]]. His Aunt Emrine had read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|69}}

After his mother's death, King and his family moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where King wrote ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]'' (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, ''[[The Stand]]'' (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. He has kept his primary residence in Maine ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Author|url=http://www.stephenking.com/the_author.html| publisher=stephenking.com| accessdate=September 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator.php?ID=2957 |title=Stephen King at The Comic Book Database |publisher=Comicbookdb.com |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing a few pages of the benefit [[X-Men]] comic book ''[[Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men]]''. The book, whose profits were donated to assist with [[famine]] relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as [[Chris Claremont]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Alan Moore]], as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as [[Harlan Ellison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/creator_title.php?ID=1385&amp;cID=2957&amp;pID=1 |title=Heroes for Hope |publisher=Comic Book Database |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, King published ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986), which was the best-selling hard-cover novel in the United States that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/05/books/fatherhood-and-it-top-sellers-of-86.html |title='FATHERHOOD' AND 'IT' TOP SELLERS OF '86 |publisher=nytimes.com |accessdate=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the introduction to ''[[Batman]]'' No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over [[Superman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookdb.com/issue.php?ID=34874 |title=Batman No. 400 |publisher=Comic Book Database |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 221 |quote = Batman celebrated the 400th issue of his self-titled comic with a blockbuster featuring dozens of famous comic book creators and... with an introduction by novelist Stephen King.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Dark Tower'' books===
{{Main|The Dark Tower (series)}}

In the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the "Man in Black" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] and the American [[Wild West]] as depicted by [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Sergio Leone]] in their [[spaghetti Western]]s. The first of these stories, ''[[The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger]]'', was initially published in five installments by ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' under the editorship of [[Edward L. Ferman]], from 1977 to 1981. ''The Gunslinger'' was continued as an eight-book epic series called ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'', whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.

==={{anchor|Richard Bachman}}Pseudonyms===
{{Main|Richard Bachman}}
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' (1977), ''[[The Long Walk]]'' (1979), ''[[Roadwork]]'' (1981), ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'' (1982) and ''[[Thinner (novel)|Thinner]]'' (1984)—under the pseudonym '''[[Richard Bachman]]'''. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year.&lt;ref name=kingbachman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php |title=Stephen King FAQ: "Why did you write books as Richard Bachman?" |author=King, Stephen |accessdate=December 13, 2006 |publisher=StephenKing.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115014750/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whybachman.php |archivedate=November 15, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He picked up the name from the hard rock band [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]], of which he is a fan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Steve|last=Newton |url=https://www.straight.com/article-193999/bto-founder-searched-stephen-king |title=Bachman-Turner Overdrive founder searched for Stephen King |website= Straight.com |date=January 13, 2009 |accessdate=September 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the [[Library of Congress]] that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Steve. [http://www.liljas-library.com/bachman_exposed.php/ 'Richard Bachman Exposed']. Lilja's Library: The World of Stephen King. Retrieved December 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a press release heralding Bachman's "death"—supposedly from "cancer of the pseudonym".&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.simonandschuster.com/9781416548584 'Blaze – Book Summary']. Simon &amp; Schuster. Retrieved January 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; King dedicated his 1989 book ''[[The Dark Half]]'', about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to "the deceased Richard Bachman", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel ''[[Desperation (novel)|Desperation]]'' was released, the companion novel ''[[The Regulators (novel)|The Regulators]]'' carried the "Bachman" byline.

In 2006, during a press conference in [[London]], King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled ''[[Blaze (novel)|Blaze]]''. It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Stephen King companion: forty years of fear from the master of horror|last=Beahm|first=George|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin|year=2015|isbn=9781466856684|location=New York |pages=118–119|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King has used other pseudonyms. The short story "[[The Fifth Quarter (short story)|The Fifth Quarter]]" was published under the pseudonym '''John Swithen''' (the name of a character in the novel ''[[Carrie (novel)|Carrie]]''), that was published in ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'' in April 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beahm|first=George|title=Stephen King from A to Z: An Encyclopedia of His Life and Work|year=1998|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0836269147|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was reprinted in King's collection ''[[Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes]]'' in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel ''[[Blaze (novel)|Blaze]]'', King claims, with [[tongue-in-cheek]], that "Bachman" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym.

The "[[children's book]]" ''[[Charlie the Choo-Choo (book)|Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower]]'' was published under the pseudonym '''Beryl Evans''', who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at [[San Diego Comic-Con]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2016/07/22/charlie-choo-choo-stephen-king-dark-tower-comic-con|title='Charlie the Choo-Choo': 'The Dark Tower' fans seek Stephen King storybook that isn't real|date=July 22, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and illustrated by Ned Dameron.

In 2000, King published [[Internet|online]] a serialized [[Horror (genre)|horror]] novel, ''[[The Plant]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Computerworld]]|date= January 8, 2001 |page=14 |title=Barnes &amp; Noble Takes Popular Literature Digital|last=Verton |first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/features/00/11/30/1238204.shtml |title=Stephen King's Net Horror Story |publisher=Slashdot |date=December 4, 2000 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unfinished [[epistolary novel]] is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, ''[[Riding the Bullet]]'', and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market "probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012". But he also warns: "Here's the thing—people tire of the new toys quickly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Minzesheimer, Bob|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-10-20-ebooks14_CV_N.htm |title=More bibliophiles get on the same page with digital readers|work=[[USA Today]]|date= October 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', usually every third week. The column, called ''The Pop of King'' (a play on the nickname "The King of Pop" commonly attributed to [[Michael Jackson]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Stephen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,472359,00.html |title=The Pop of King: The Tao of Steve |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=February 1, 2007 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, King published an [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apocalyptic novel]], ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]''. The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.

In 2008, King published both a novel, ''[[Duma Key]]'', and a collection, ''[[Just After Sunset]]''. The latter featured 13 short stories, including a novella, ''[[N. (novella)|N.]]'', which was later {{when|date=July 2018}} released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free, or, for a small fee, could be downloaded in a higher quality; it then was adopted into a limited comic book series.

In 2009, King published ''[[Ur (novella)|Ur]]'', a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation [[Amazon Kindle]] and available only on [[Amazon.com]], and ''[[Throttle (novella)|Throttle]]'', a novella co-written with his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]] and released  later as an [[audiobook]] titled ''[[Road Rage (audiobook)|Road Rage]]'', which included [[Richard Matheson]]'s short story "[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]". King's novel ''[[Under the Dome (novel)|Under the Dome]]'' was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since ''[[It (novel)|It]]'' (1986). ''Under the Dome'' debuted at No. 1 in [[The New York Times Bestseller List|''The New York Times'' Bestseller List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2009-11-29/hardcover-fiction/list.html|title=Best Sellers – The New York Times|date=November 29, 2009|accessdate=March 20, 2011|first=Jennifer|last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 16, 2010, King announced on his Web site that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called ''[[Full Dark, No Stars]]''. In April of that year, King published ''[[Blockade Billy]]'', an original novella issued first by independent small press [[Cemetery Dance Publications]] and later released in mass-market paperback by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. The following month, [[DC Comics]] premiered ''[[American Vampire]]'', a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer [[Scott Snyder]], and illustrated by [[Rafael Albuquerque]], which represents King's first original comics work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vertigo.blog.dccomics.com/2009/10/25/scott-snyder-and-stephen-king-to-write-a-new-horror-comic-book-series-american-vampire/ |last=Mullin |first=Pamela|title=SCOTT SNYDER and STEPHEN KING to write a new horror comic book series, AMERICAN VAMPIRE|publisher=Vertigo.blog.dccomics.com |date=October 25, 2009 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091026-american-vampire.html |title=Stephen King Brings an ''American Vampire'' Tale to Vertigo |first=Vaneta |last=Rogers |date=October 26, 2009 |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028231812/http://www.newsarama.com/comics/091026-american-vampire.html |archivedate=October 28, 2009 |dead-url=no |accessdate=April 1, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Vaneta.

On November 3, 2015, King released his tenth collection of short stories, ''[[The Bazaar of Bad Dreams]]''. The book was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.

During a tour to promote ''[[End of Watch (novel)|End of Watch]]'', King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled [[Sleeping Beauties (novel)|''Sleeping Beauties'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://firewireblog.com/2016/06/14/sleeping-beauties-a-new-book-by-stephen-owen-king-due-in-2017/|title=Sleeping Beauties; A New Book By Stephen &amp; Owen King Due In 2017|date=June 14, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the novel was released in October 2017, it reached the top of the [[The New York Times Fiction Best Sellers of 2017|''New York Times'' Best Seller List]].

==Collaborations==
===Writings===
King has written two novels with horror novelist [[Peter Straub]]: ''[[The Talisman (King and Straub novel)|The Talisman]]'' (1984) and a sequel, ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no deadline for its completion.

King produced an [[artist's book]] with designer [[Barbara Kruger]], ''[[My Pretty Pony]]'' (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]]. [[Alfred A. Knopf]] released it in a general trade edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=11920 |title=The Collection &amp;#124; Barbara Kruger. My Pretty Pony. 1988 |publisher=MoMA |accessdate=September 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the short story was later included in King's collection ''[[Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes]]'' published in 1993.

''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer: My Life at Rose Red]]'' (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries ''[[Rose Red (miniseries)|Rose Red]]'' (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a [[diary]] by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional [[afterword]] by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to ''Rose Red'', titled ''[[The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer (TV film)|The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer]]''. This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author's being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]''. [[Richard Dooling]], King's collaborator on ''Kingdom Hospital'' and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, ''The Journals of Eleanor Druse'', in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in ''Kingdom Hospital'', much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in ''Rose Red.''

King also wrote the nonfiction book, ''[[Faithful (book)|Faithful]]'' (2004), with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic [[Stewart O'Nan]].

''[[Throttle (novella)|Throttle]]'' (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son [[Joe Hill (writer)|Joe Hill]], appears in the anthology ''He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gauntletpress.com/cgi-bin/gauntletpress/perlshop.cgi?ACTION=template&amp;thispage=HeisLegend&amp;ORDER_ID=251390396 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511204109/http://www.gauntletpress.com/cgi-bin/gauntletpress/perlshop.cgi?ACTION=template&amp;thispage=HeisLegend&amp;ORDER_ID=251390396 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |title=Gauntlet Press website, forthcoming titles |publisher=Gauntletpress.com |accessdate=September 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their second novella collaboration, ''[[In the Tall Grass]]'' (2012), was published in two parts in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/june-july-2012-contents |title=June/July 2012 Contents |work=Esquire |date=May 22, 2012 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/august-2012-contents |title=August 2012 Contents |work=Esquire |date=July 3, 2012 |accessdate=January 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later released in [[e-book]] and [[audiobook]] formats, the latter read by [[Stephen Lang (actor)|Stephen Lang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/1442359889/|title=In the Tall Grass|first1=Stephen|last1=King|first2=Joe|last2=Hill|first3=Stephen|last3=Lang|date=October 9, 2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster Audio|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen King and [[Richard Chizmar]] co-wrote ''[[Gwendy's Button Box]]'' which was released in May 2017 from [[Cemetery Dance Publications]] (in trade hardcover format) and in audiobook from [[Simon &amp; Schuster Audio]] (the audiobook has a bonus short story "The Music Room" which was originally published in ''[[Playboy]]'').

King and his son [[Owen King]] wrote the novel ''[[Sleeping Beauties (novel)|Sleeping Beauties]]'', released in 2017, that is set in a women's prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thurman|first1=Trace|title=Stephen King Turns 69 Today!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3407089/stephen-king-69th-birthday/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=6 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
King is a fan of the [[Ramones]], to the extent that he wrote the liner notes for the 2003 Ramones tribute album ''[[We're a Happy Family: A Tribute to Ramones|We're a Happy Family]]''.&lt;ref name="EWram"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2010/09/24/stephen-king-pop-music | title=Stephen King on pop music | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=17 January 2005 | accessdate= 29 April 2015 | last=King | first = Stephen | authorlink=Stephen King}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that he agreed to write them because he "loved The Ramones from the first time (he) heard them".&lt;ref name="MTVRam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1457102/rob-zombie-finalizes-ramones-tribute-with-last-minute-adds/ | title=Rob Zombie Finalizes Ramones Tribute With Last-Minute Adds | publisher=''[[MTV]]'' | accessdate=29 April 2015 | last=D'Angelo | first=Joe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NonFiction"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Rocky|title=Stephen King: The Non-Fiction|year=2008|publisher=Cemetery Dance|isbn=1-58767-160-3|authorlink=Rocky Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, King has referred to the band several times in his writing, both in his fiction and non-fiction.&lt;ref name="digispy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/thesound/a314428/joey-ramone-six-rare-videos.html | title=Joey Ramone: Six rare videos | work=[[Digital Spy]] | date=15 April 2011 | accessdate=29 April 2015 | last=Nissim | first=Mayer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-fiction references include a mention in King's book ''Danse Macabre'' where he calls the Ramones "an amusing punk-rock band that surfaced some four years ago".&lt;ref name="DanseM"&gt;{{cite book| last= King| first= Stephen|title=Danse Macabre|page=93|year=1981|publisher=Futura| place = London (UK) | isbn=0-7088-2181-2|authorlink=Stephen King}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote about them in ''On Writing'', making reference to "dancing to the Ramones—gabba gabba hey" as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|41}} King included further Ramones references in his fictional work. He quotes the lyrics to the Ramones' debut single "[[Blitzkrieg Bop]]" in his novel ''[[Pet Sematary]]'' on numerous occasions, as in the sentence "What is it the Ramones say? Hey-ho, let's go"!&lt;ref name="PetSem"&gt;{{cite book| last= King| first=Stephen|title=Pet Sematary|page=247|year=1983|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|place = London (UK)| isbn= 0-450-05769-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Dark Tower (series)|The Dark Tower]]'' novel ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'' the Ramones get a further mention by the character Eddie Dean who states that "Roland stage-dives like [[Joey Ramone]]".&lt;ref name="WotC"&gt;{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen|title=Wolves of the Calla|page=203|year=2003|publisher=[[Hodder &amp; Stoughton]]|place = London (UK)|isbn=0-340-82715-7 | authorlink=Stephen King}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have also noted the Ramones references. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', for example, in their review of ''[[Black House (novel)|Black House]]'' by King and [[Peter Straub]], note that King's "trademark references" are in evidence, quoting [[Dee Dee Ramone]].&lt;ref name="EWBlackHo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ew.com/article/2001/09/21/black-house | title=Black House | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date=17 January 2015 | accessdate= 30 April 2015 | last=Fretts | first=Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the Ramones have referenced King on their song "It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)", from their ''[[Pleasant Dreams]]'' album of 1981 in the line: "Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo / Roger Corman's on a talk show / With Allan Arkush and Stephen King".&lt;ref name="lyrics"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/its-not-my-place-in-the-9-to-5-world-lyrics-the-ramones.html | title=It's Not My Place (in The 9 To 5 World) lyrics | publisher=[[MetroLyrics]] | accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Licensed lyrics provider --&gt;&lt;!-- see WP:LYRICS --&gt; Further, Dee Dee Ramone wrote the song "[[Pet Sematary (song)|Pet Sematary]]" in King's basement after King handed him a copy of the novel.&lt;ref name="NYPRam"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://nypost.com/2015/01/07/marky-ramone-on-drugs-cursing-out-sting-and-writing-a-song-in-stephen-kings-basement/ | title=Marky Ramone on drugs, cursing out Sting and writing a song in Stephen King's basement | work=[[New York Post]] | date=7 January 2015 | accessdate=29 April 2015 |last=Young | first=Royal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was eventually featured as the title song for the ''[[Pet Sematary (1989 film)|Pet Sematary]]'' (1989) film and also appeared on the Ramones album ''[[Brain Drain (album)|Brain Drain]]'' (1989).&lt;ref name="AMRam"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/pet-sematary-mt0010738936 | title=The Ramones Pet Sematary | publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=29 April 2015 | last=Mason | first=Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is also a fan of [[hard rock]] such as [[AC/DC]]; he arranged for their album ''[[Who Made Who]]'' to feature as the score for the film he directed in 1986, ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]''.&lt;ref name="UTDmusic"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radio.com/2013/06/13/inside-music-stephen-king-under-the-dome/ | title=Inside The Music Of Stephen King's 'Under The Dome' Miniseries | work=radio.com | publisher=''[[CBS Corporation|CBS]] | date=13 June 2013 | accessdate=30 April 2015 | last=Ives | first=Brian | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702171132/http://radio.com/2013/06/13/inside-music-stephen-king-under-the-dome/# | archive-date=July 2, 2015 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; King has also stated that he likes [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and has named bands like [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Judas Priest]] and [[Metallica]] as amongst his favourites to write to.&lt;ref name="atlan"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/04/stephen-king-on-the-creative-process-the-state-of-fiction-and-more/237023/ | title=Stephen King on the Creative Process, the State of Fiction, and More | work=[[The Atlantic]] | date=12 April 2011 | accessdate=30 April 2015 | last=Parker | first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the band [[Blue Öyster Cult]] recorded an updated version of its 1974 song [[Astronomy (song)|"Astronomy"]].

==Analysis==

===Writing style===
[[File:Stephen_King - 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stephen King in 2011]]
King's formula for learning to write well is: "Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer." He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: "If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented."&lt;ref&gt;''Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully—in Ten Minutes''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book ''[[Dreamcatcher (novel)|Dreamcatcher]]'' with a notebook and a [[Waterman pens|Waterman]] [[fountain pen]], which he called "the world's finest word processor".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | title =Dreamcatcher | publisher=Scribner | year =2001 | isbn = 0-7432-1138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked why he writes, King responds: "The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |title=Stephen King's official site |accessdate=May 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509175239/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/whywriter.php |archivedate=May 9, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: "Why do you assume I have a choice?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =King | first =Stephen | title =Night Shift | publisher=Doubleday | year =1976 | location =xii | page =336 | isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt; King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a "what if" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.&lt;ref name=JennaBlum6&gt;Jenna Blum, 2013, ''The Modern Scholar'' published by Recorded Books, ''The Author at Work: The Art of Writing Fiction'', Disk 1, Track 11, {{ISBN|978-1-4703-8437-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of [[fictional book]]s in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in ''[[Misery (novel)|Misery]]'', adult Bill Denbrough in ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', Ben Mears in ''[[Salem's Lot]]'', and Jack Torrance in ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''. He has extended this to breaking the [[fourth wall]] by including ''himself'' as a character in the [[Dark Tower series|''Dark Tower'' series]] from ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]'' onwards. See also [[List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King]] for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for ''[[Fangoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html Stephen King writes for FANGORIA!] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090925002142/http://www.fangoria.com/home/news/1-latest-news/3978-stephen-king-writes-for-fangoria.html |date=September 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influences===
King has called [[Richard Matheson]] "the author who influenced me most as a writer."&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://io9.com/r-i-p-richard-matheson-author-of-i-am-legend-and-many-564036878 | title=R.I.P.

[[Ray Bradbury]] is another influence, with King himself stating "without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King".&lt;ref name="nokingquote"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wga.org/writtenby/writtenbysub.aspx?id=4869 | title=Ray Bradbury: A Lion at 90, 91, 92... | publisher=The Writer's Guild of America | accessdate=June 7, 2012 | author=Stayton, Richard | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506210719/http://www.wga.org/writtenby/writtenbysub.aspx?id=4869 | archivedate=May 6, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

King refers to [[H. P. Lovecraft]] several times in ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]''. "[[Gramma (short story)|Gramma]]", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show ''[[The New Twilight Zone]]'', mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation ''[[Necronomicon]]'', also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein. "[[I Know What You Need]]" from the 1976 collection ''[[Night Shift (book)|Night Shift]]'', and ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' also mention the tome. Despite this, in ''On Writing'', King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from "[[The Colour Out of Space]]" as particularly poor examples.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|143–4}} There are also several examples of King's referring to [[Lovecraftian]] characters and settings in his work, such as [[Nyarlathotep]] and [[Yog-Sothoth]].

King acknowledges the influence of [[Bram Stoker]], particularly on his novel ''Salem's Lot'', which he envisioned as a retelling of ''[[Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;King, Stephen. [http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/_salem_s_lot_inspiration.html 'Salem's Lot: Inspiration], stephenking.com. Retrieved March 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Its related short story "Jerusalem's Lot" is reminiscent of Stoker's ''[[The Lair of the White Worm]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} He also gives [[Joseph Payne Brennan]] credit for being one of his inspirations; "Joseph Payne Brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre, and he is certainly one of the writers I have patterned my own career upon; one of the writers whom I studied and with whom I kept school."&lt;ref&gt;Spignesi, Stephen J. (Aug 4, 2010).

King's ''The Shining'' is immersed in [[Gothic literature|gothic]] influences, including "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]] (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, [[Horace Walpole]]'s ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]'').&lt;ref name="Gothic influence"/&gt; The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.&lt;ref name="Gothic influence"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-30313775 "The Castle of Otranto: The creepy tale that launched gothic fiction"]. BBC. Retrieved October 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

King has also referred to author [[Shirley Jackson]]. ''Salem's Lot'' opens with a quotation from Jackson's ''[[The Haunting of Hill House]]'', and a character in ''[[The Dark Tower V: Wolves of the Calla|Wolves of the Calla]]'' references the Jackson book ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]''. King's book ''[[11/22/63]]'' mentions the Jackson story "The Summer People". King is a fan of [[John D. MacDonald]], and dedicated the novella "Sun Dog" to MacDonald, saying "I miss you, old friend." For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to ''Night Shift'', and even had his famous character, [[Travis McGee]], reading ''Cujo'' in one of the last McGee novels and ''Pet Sematary'' in the last McGee novel, ''The Lonely Silver Rain.''

In 1987, King's [[Philtrum Press]] published [[Don Robertson (author)|Don Robertson]]'s novel ''The Ideal, Genuine Man''. In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, "Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Robertson | first = Don | authorlink = Don Robertson (author) | title = The Ideal, Genuine Man | publisher=Philtrum Press | year = 1987 | location = Bangor, ME | pages = viiI | url = | id = | isbn = | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s book ''[[The Door into Summer]]'' is repeatedly mentioned in King's ''[[Wolves of the Calla]]'' (2003), as are several other works. ''Wolves of the Calla'' is the King work in which ''The Dark Tower'' begins to follow a meta-fictional path.

In an interview with King, published in the ''[[USA Weekend]]'' in March 2009, the author stated, "People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. [[Elmore Leonard]], every day I wake up and—not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree—don't see his obituary in the paper, I think to myself, "Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read. Because when he's gone, there's nobody else."&lt;ref&gt;"Exclusive: Stephen King on J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer"&lt;/ref&gt;

King partly dedicated his book ''[[Cell (novel)|Cell]]'' to film director [[George Romero]], and wrote an essay for the Elite DVD version of ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]''.
 
His favorite books are (in order): ''[[The Golden Argosy]]''; ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''; ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; ''[[McTeague]]''; ''[[Lord of the Flies]]''; ''[[Bleak House]]''; ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''; ''[[The Raj Quartet]]''; ''[[Light in August]]''; and ''[[Blood Meridian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen King's Top Ten List (2007)|url=http://www.toptenbooks.net/authors/Stephen-King}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Although critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers.

Science fiction editors [[John Clute]] and [[Peter Nichols]]&lt;ref&gt;Clute, John and Peter Nichols. ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction''. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 1993. {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his "pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers."

In his book ''The Philosophy of Horror'' (1990), [[Noël Carroll]] discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, "the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Noël (1990) ''The Philosophy of Horror, or, Paradoxes of the Heart''. NY: Routledge, 0-415-90145-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, ''The Modern Weird Tale'' (2001), critic [[S. T. Joshi]]&lt;ref&gt;Joshi, S.T, ''The Modern Weird Tale: A Critique of Horror Fiction'', McFarland &amp; Company, 2001, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-0986-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to ''[[deus ex machina]]'' endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since ''[[Gerald's Game]]'' (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible "[[everyman]]" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—''[[Rage (Stephen King novel)|Rage]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Running Man (novel)|The Running Man]]'' (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed [[Suspense (genre)|suspense thriller]]s, with believable characters.

In 1996, King won an [[O. Henry Award]] for his short story "[[The Man in the Black Suit]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/anchor/ohenry/winners/past.html#jump_k "Past Winners List"]. The PEN/O. Henry Prize Stories. Retrieved May 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his short story collection ''A Century of Great Suspense Stories'', editor [[Jeffery Deaver]] noted that King "singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that ''[['Salem's Lot]]'' was "''[[Peyton Place (novel)|Peyton Place]]'' meets ''Dracula''. And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. 'Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Century of Great Suspense Stories|editor=Jeffrey Deaver|page=290|publisher=Berkley Hardcover|date=2001|ISBN=0-425-18192-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, King was honored by the [[National Book Award]]s with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: [[Richard E. Snyder]], the former CEO of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], described King's work as "non-literature" and critic [[Harold Bloom]] denounced the choice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for "distinguished contribution" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of [[dumbing down]] our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of [[penny dreadful]]s, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. What he is&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2003/09/24/dumbing_down_american_readers/ |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]| title=Dumbing down American readers | first=Harold | last=Bloom | date=September 24, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, others came to King's defense, such as writer [[Orson Scott Card]], who responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hatrack.com/osc/reviews/everything/2003-09-21.shtml |title=Yummi Bears, Lions, Boomtown, Mayer, and King – Uncle Orson Reviews Everything |publisher=Hatrack.com |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

King himself later stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Harold] Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess. He might be able to say that [[Mark Twain]] is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] to [[Jim Thompson (writer)|Jim Thompson]] because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, "I never read him, but I know he's terrible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/stephen-king-the-rolling-stone-interview-20141031 |title=Stephen King: The Rolling Stone Interview |publisher=Hatrack.com |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of the 2004 movie ''[[Secret Window]]'', he stated, "A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously. But after finding that his book ''On Writing'' had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', I have gotten over my own snobbery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040312/REVIEWS/403120306/1023 |title=Secret Window |work=Chicago Sun-Times |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, King's book ''On Writing'' was ranked 21st on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' list of "The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20207076_20207387_20207349,00.html |title=The New Classics: Books &amp;#124; EW 1000: Books &amp;#124; The EW 1000|work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 27, 2008 |accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King has stated that his favorite book-to-film adaptations are ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'', ''[[The Shawshank Redemption]]'', and ''[[The Mist (film)|The Mist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[//www.youtube.com/watch?v=BXRuWx-mkTc&amp;feature=related Matt Lauer interview of King] on ''[[The Today Show]]'', YouTube, February 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

King's first film appearance was in [[George A. Romero|George Romero's]] ''[[Knightriders]]'' as a buffoonish audience member. His first featured role was in ''[[Creepshow]]'', in particular the segment "The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill" (King also having written the original story), where he plays the titular character. He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works. He appeared in ''[[Pet Sematary (1989 film)|Pet Sematary]]'' as a minister at a funeral, in ''[[Thinner (film)|Thinner]]'' as a pharmacist, in ''[[Rose Red (film)|Rose Red]]'' as a pizza deliveryman, as a news reporter in ''The Storm of the Century'', in ''[[The Stand (TV miniseries)|The Stand]]'' as "Teddy Wieszack," in the ''[[The Shining (TV miniseries)|Shining]]'' miniseries as a band member, in ''[[The Langoliers (TV miniseries)|The Langoliers]]'' as Tom Holby; in ''[[Sleepwalkers (film)|Sleepwalkers]]'' as the cemetery caretaker and ''Golden Years'' as a bus driver. He has also appeared in ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'' and, along with fellow author [[Amy Tan]], on ''[[Insane Clown Poppy|The Simpsons]]'' as himself. In addition to acting, King tried his hand at directing with ''[[Maximum Overdrive]]'', in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cracked.com/blog/the-creepiest-thing-about-stephen-king-his-acting-career/|title=The Cocaine-Fueled Acting Cameos Of Stephen King|website=Cracked.com|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; King had also been approached to appear in the 1985 Romero film ''Day of the Dead'' as a zombie. Although King declined due to scheduling conflicts, a copy of one of his works makes an appearance being held by the foremost zombie "Bub". King would once again work with Romero in 1993 when his work ''The Dark Half'' was filmed and directed by George Romero.

King produced and acted in a television series, ''[[Kingdom Hospital]]'', which is based on the Danish miniseries ''[[Riget]]'' by [[Lars von Trier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2004/tv/reviews/stephen-king-s-kingdom-hospital-1200534769/|title=Review: 'Stephen King's Kingdom Hospital'|last=Lowry|first=Brian|date=2004-02-29|work=Variety|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also co-wrote ''[[The X-Files]]'' season-5 episode "[[The X-Files (season 5)#Episodes|Chinga]]" with the creator of the series [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]].

King made an appearance as a contestant on ''[[List of Jeopardy! tournaments and events#Celebrity Jeopardy!|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]'' in 1995, playing to benefit the [[Bangor Public Library]].

King provided the voice of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in the [[audiobook]] version of ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''.

On June 19, 1999, at about 4:30&amp;nbsp;p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of [[Maine State Route 5]], in [[Lovell, Maine]]. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (four meters) from the pavement of Route 5.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|206}} According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html|title=King's accident|publisher=Lijia's Library|accessdate=2014-12-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307182428/http://www.liljas-library.com/accident.html|archivedate=March 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''On Writing'' King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car also northbound passed King first and then the light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped "that guy in the van doesn't hit him."&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|206}}

King was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by air ambulance to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in [[Lewiston, Maine|Lewiston]]. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an [[external fixator]].&lt;ref&gt;Rogak, Lisa.

King's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on [[eBay]]. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he fantasized about smashing it up. King later mentioned during an interview with ''[[Fresh Air]]'s'' [[Terry Gross]] that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1124785 "Novelist Stephen King"] ''Fresh Air''; [[NPR]] June 22, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dubner, Stephen J.

During this time, Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel ''[[Lisey's Story]]'' (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zrj5n4oC-Wc |title=Origin of Stephen King's novel, LISEY'S STORY|date= December 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, King announced he would stop writing, apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries, which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina. He has since resumed writing, but states on his Web site:

{{Quote|I'm writing but I'm writing at a much slower pace than previously and I think that if I come up with something really, really good, I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process, publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can talk about it with each other and with you, the writer, but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that's as it should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/retired.php |work=StephenKing.com |title=The Official FAQ: Is it true that you have retired? |accessdate=March 4, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013010729/http://www.stephenking.com/pages/FAQ/Stephen_King/retired.php |archivedate=October 13, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Political views and activism==
In April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the [[Massachusetts state legislature]] that would restrict or ban the sale of [[Video game controversies|violent video games]] to anyone under the age of 18. Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to other people's children, which he asserted is usually "disastrous" and "undemocratic." He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see ''[[Hostel: Part II]]'', from buying or renting ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'', which is violent but less graphic.  While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence.&lt;ref&gt;King, Stephen; "Videogame Lunacy"; "The Pop of King" ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''; April 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding video games, he later stated that he enjoys playing [[light gun shooter]] [[arcade game]]s such as ''[[Time Crisis]]''.&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, Stephen|title=Book Review: The Hunger Games|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20223443,00.html|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=September 8, 2008|accessdate=February 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a [[Library of Congress]] reading event on the Web site NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: "If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=204835-1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518213220/http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=204835-1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 18, 2008 |title=Discussion on Writing with Stephen King |publisher=C-spanarchives.org |accessdate=September 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The comment was described by the blog as "another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military," and likened to [[John Kerry]]'s [[John Kerry#.22You get stuck in Iraq.22 controversy|similar remark]] from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheppard |first=Noel |url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2008/05/05/writer-stephen-king-if-you-cant-read-youll-end-army-or-iraq |title=Writer Stephen King: If You Can't Read, You'll End Up in the Army or Iraq|publisher=News Busters|date=May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King responded later that day, saying, "That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise." King again defended his comment in an interview with the ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' on May 8, saying, "I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/archive/stephen-king-fires-back-after-bloggers-criticism_2008-05-06.html "Stephen King fires back after blogger's criticism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730160328/http://www.pressherald.com/archive/stephen-king-fires-back-after-bloggers-criticism_2008-05-06.html |date=July 30, 2013 }}. ''[[Portland Press Herald]]''. March 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a "brain cramp", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.aol.com/video/what-stephen-king-wishes-he-never-said?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00001346 "What Stephen King wishes he never said"]. [[The Huffington Post]]. Retrieved December 10, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

King's website states that he is a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/175900,stephen-king-backing-barack-obama.html|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120729020314/http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/175900,stephen-king-backing-barack-obama.html|deadurl=yes|title=Earth Times: show/175900,stephen-king-backing-barack-obama.html|date=July 29, 2012|archivedate=July 29, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King was quoted as calling conservative commentator [[Glenn Beck]] "Satan's mentally challenged younger brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David |last=Von Drehle |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1924495-3,00.html |title=Mad Man: Is Glenn Beck Bad for America?|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=September 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]] aimed against Governor [[Rick Scott]] (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref name=stooges&gt;Bershad, Jon.

On April 30, 2012, King published an article in ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as "a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion".&lt;ref name=DailyBeast&gt;{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=King|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/30/stephen-king-tax-me-for-f-s-sake.html |title=Stephen King: Tax Me, for F@%&amp;'s Sake!|work=The Daily Beast|date=March 21, 2011|accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled "Guns" via [[Amazon.com]]'s [[Kindle single]] feature, which discusses the [[Gun politics in the United States|gun debate]] in the wake of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].  King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, "Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carroll|first=Rory|title=Stephen King risks wrath of NRA by releasing pro-gun control essay|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/25/stephen-king-gun-control-essay-amazon-nra|newspaper=The Guardian|date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=King|first=Stephen|title=Stephen King: why the US must introduce limited gun controls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/01/stephen-king-pulled-book-gun-controls|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel, Benjamin (February 14, 2013).

King has criticized [[Donald Trump]] and Rep.

===Maine politics===
King had endorsed [[Shenna Bellows]] in the [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2014|2014 U.S. Senate election]] for the seat held by [[Maine Republican Party|Republican]] [[Susan Collins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=King, Stephen |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2014/05/29/opinion/for-this-lifetime-mainer-bellows-is-the-clear-choice/|title=For this lifetime Mainer, Bellows is the clear choice|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=May 30, 2014|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is a public critic of [[Paul LePage]], the Republican [[Governor of Maine]], and has referred to LePage as one of the [[Three Stooges]], along with [[Governor of Florida|Florida Governor]] [[Rick Scott]] and [[Governor of Wisconsin|Wisconsin Governor]] [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]].&lt;ref name=stooges /&gt;  He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued.  King said LePage was "full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mistler|first=Steve|title=Stephen King calls out LePage on erroneous tax statements|url=http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/03/20/stephen-king-calls-out-lepage-on-erroneous-tax-statements/|newspaper=Kennebec Journal|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demanded that LePage "man up and apologize".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mistler|first=Steve|title=King to LePage: 'Man up and apologize' |url=http://contributors.pressherald.com/politics/capitol-ticker/king-to-lepage-man-up-and-apologize/|newspaper=Kennebec Journal|date=March 20, 2015|accessdate=March 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LePage declined to apologize to King, stating "I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mistler|first=Steve|title=LePage crashes local budget forum, denies saying Stephen King doesn't pay taxes|url=http://contributors.pressherald.com/politics/capitol-ticker/lepage-crashes-local-democrats-budget-forum-denies-he-said-stephen-king-doesnt-pay-taxes/|newspaper=Portland Press Herald|date=March 26, 2015 |accessdate=March 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  LePage further told King that he should "make me the villain of your next book and I won't charge you royalties".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Steve|title=Talking taxes: Maine's governor talks tough on taxes in Bristo|url=http://www.centralctcommunications.com/bristolpress/news/article_b4ca4464-d41d-11e4-a340-f37c6067029c.html|newspaper=The Bristol Press|date=March 26, 2015|accessdate=March 27, 2015|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170324021643/http://www.centralctcommunications.com/bristolpress/news/article_b4ca4464-d41d-11e4-a340-f37c6067029c.html|archivedate=March 24, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attention garnered by the LePage criticism has led to efforts to encourage King to run for [[Governor of Maine]] in [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2018|2018]].  [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]] city councilor [[Joe Baldacci]] posted on his Facebook page that he was starting a Draft Stephen King effort, and Democratic State Rep. [[Diane Russell]] launched a petition drive to encourage King to run.  His spokeswoman posted to Baldacci's Facebook comment that he would likely decline to run,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/03/23/stephen-king-for-governor-horror-story-or-best-seller/|title=Stephen King for governor: Horror story or best seller? |publisher=Bangor Daily News |first=Christopher|last=Cousins |date=March 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and King himself stated he would not run or serve on March 23 while still criticizing what he said was the "laziness that made him mad" about not checking his tax payments and that LePage had "a problem finding a comfortable pair of big-boy pants".&lt;ref name=kingno&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stateandcapitol.bangordailynews.com/2015/03/23/update-king-continues-attack-on-lepage-says-i-will-not-run-for-governor/ |title=UPDATE: King continues attack on LePage, says 'I will not run' for governor |publisher=Bangor Daily News |first=Christopher |last=Cousins |date=March 23, 2015 |accessdate=March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, stating that LePage is "a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign." He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to "go to work or go back home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hashtagmaine.bangordailynews.com/2015/07/01/reddit/stephen-king-joins-call-for-lepage-to-resign/|title=Stephen King joins call for LePage to resign |publisher=Bangor Daily News |first=Erin|last=Rhoda |date=July 1, 2015 |accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 27, 2016, King sent another tweet about LePage, calling him "a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.boston.com/news/politics/2016/08/28/maines-stephen-king-says-gov-paul-lepage-is-a-bigot-a-homophobe-and-a-racist/ |title=Maine's Stephen King says Gov.

==Philanthropy==
King has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year "to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment ([[Jaws of Life]] tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts."&lt;ref name=DailyBeast /&gt;&lt;ref name="GuardianTax"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/01/stephen-king-tax-the-rich | title=Stephen King: I'm rich, tax me | publisher=The Guardian | date=1 May 2012 | accessdate=30 March 2015 | author=Flood, Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by the author and his wife, ranks sixth among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to [[The Grantsmanship Center]].&lt;ref name="Grantsmanship"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.tgci.com/funding-sources/ME/top | title=Top Giving Foundations: ME | publisher=The Grantsmanship Center | accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/10/stephen-king-donate-70000-maine?intcmp=239 |title=Stephen King to donate $70,000 to heat Maine homes|newspaper=The Guardian |location=UK |date=November 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:Stephenking house.JPG|thumb|300px|King's home in [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]]]]
King married [[Tabitha King|Tabitha Spruce]] in 1971. She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and divide their time between three houses: one in [[Bangor, Maine]], one in [[Lovell, Maine]], and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in [[Sarasota, Florida]]. The Kings have three children, a daughter and two sons, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name=OfficialBio/&gt; Their daughter Naomi is a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist Church]] minister in [[Plantation, Florida]], with her lesbian partner, Rev.

[[Joe Hill (writer)|Joseph Hillstrom King]], who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, ''[[20th Century Ghosts]]'', in 2005. His debut novel, ''[[Heart-Shaped Box (novel)|Heart-Shaped Box]]'' (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i24f58f9705c1a288fbb70a9ce94d51e1 |title=Jordan will build 'Box' for Warners |publisher=Hollywood Reporter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930223244/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3i24f58f9705c1a288fbb70a9ce94d51e1 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

King's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in ''On Writing'' in 2000, he can barely remember writing ''[[Cujo]]''.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|73}} Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of [[cocaine]], [[Alprazolam|Xanax]], [[Valium]], [[NyQuil]], [[dextromethorphan]] (cough medicine) and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since.&lt;ref name="UKOnWriting" /&gt;{{rp|72}} The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was ''[[Needful Things]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen King, The Art of Fiction No. 189 |work=[[The Paris Review]]|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5653/the-art-of-fiction-no-189-stephen-king|accessdate=June 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King is a fan of baseball, and of the [[Boston Red Sox]] in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories. He helped coach his son Owen's Bangor West team to the Maine [[Little League]] Championship in 1989. He recounts this experience in the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' essay "[[Head Down (essay)|Head Down]]", which appears also in the collection ''[[Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes]]''. In 1999, King wrote ''[[The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon]],'' featuring former Red Sox pitcher [[Tom Gordon]] as the protagonist's imaginary companion. In 2004, King co-wrote a book titled ''[[Faithful (book)|Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season]]'' with [[Stewart O'Nan]], recounting the authors' roller-coaster reaction to the Red Sox's 2004 season, a season culminating in the Sox winning the [[2004 American League Championship Series]] and [[2004 World Series|World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2004.shtml|title=2004 Boston Red Sox Statistics|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=June 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2005 film ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]],'' about an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan, King tosses out the first pitch of the Sox's opening-day game.

A '''talent manager''' (also known as an '''artist manager''', '''band manager''' or '''music manager''') is an individual or company who guides the professional career of [[entertainer|artists]] in the [[entertainment industry]]. The responsibility of the talent manager is to oversee the day-to-day [[business]] affairs of an artist; advise and counsel talent concerning professional matters, long-term plans and personal decisions which may affect their career.&lt;ref name="casestudy"&gt;[http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm MusicBizAdvice Q&amp;A] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115173626/http://www.musicbizadvice.com/qa_how_much_does_the_average_concert_promoter_make_per_year_and_how_hard_is_the_course_of_study.htm |date=2009-01-15 }} January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;   

The roles and responsibilities of a talent manager vary slightly from industry to industry, as do the [[Commission (remuneration)|commissions]] to which the manager is entitled. For example, a music manager's duties differ from those managers who advise [[actor]]s, [[writer]]s, or [[film director|director]]s. A manager can also help artists find an agent, or help them decide when to leave their current agent and identify who to select as a new agent.&lt;ref name="breakingintrodummies"&gt;Garrison, Larry. ''Breaking Into Acting for Dummies'', Wiley Publishing Inc., 2002, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talent agent]]s have the authority to make deals for their clients while managers usually can only informally establish connections with producers and studios but do not have the ability to negotiate contracts.

==History==
{{See also|Category:Talent agents}}
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}
Modern talents managers are associated with all artistic fields, sports, as well as various fields in business.{{cn|date=February 2015}} Talent agents have at times been covered in the music or art press almost as intently as artists themselves, for example the various talent agents who spearheaded the British Invasion of [[The Beatles]] and [[Herman's Hermits]] in the 1960s such as [[Brian Epstein]], [[Allan Williams]], [[Harvey Lisberg]]. Infamous examples in the music press include [[Allen Klein]], manager of both The Beatles and [[The Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/allen-klein-notorious-business-manager-for-the-beatles-and-the-rolling-stones-1732780.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=July 6, 2009 | title=Allen Klein: Notorious business manager for the Beatles and the Rolling Stones}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a list of talent agents deemed notable by [[wp:GNG|Wikipedia's general notability guidelines]], see [[:Category:Talent agents]]. For notable agencies and businesses, see [[:Category:Talent agencies]].

The industry of talent management has been unionized or organized in several forms throughout history. In the United States, a notable early example was the [[Association of Talent Agents]], which was formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1937. The ATA comes out of the [[Wagner Act]] upheld by the Supreme Court which established many of the unions and guilds that regulate people who work in the entertainment industry such as the [[Screen Actors Guild]], [[Directors Guild of America]], and [[Writers Guild of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agentassociation.com/ Association of Talent Agents]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music managers==&lt;!--Linked to from "Music management"--&gt;
A music manager (or band manager) may handle career areas for [[Musical ensemble|bands]], [[singers]], and [[DJ]]s. A music manager may be hired by a musician or band, or the manager  may discover the band, and the relationship is usually contractually bound with mutual assurances, warranties, performances guarantees, and so forth.  The manager's main job is to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotion, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers can be extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, [[business manager]] (who are usually [[certified public accountants]]), [[Tour promoter|tour managers]], and sometimes even a [[personal assistant]].  

Manager's contracts, however, cannot license those responsibilities unto the manager in the same way a state license would empower the agent to do so.  Therefore, conflicting areas of interest may arise unless those are clarified in the contract.  That said, a manager should be able to read and understand and explain a [[contract]] and study up on the long-term implications of contractual agreements that they, the bands, and the people they do business with, enter into. Before the manager enters into an agreement with the band, their relationship may be regarded as competing for interest; after a good contract is signed, their interests, obligations and incentives are aligned, and the interest in success is shared.  

Responsibilities of a music manager are often divided among many who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers may assume multiple roles: graphic designer, [[publicist]], promoter, and handling money and finances. As an artist's career develops, responsibilities may grow, and because of their percentage agreement with the band, the manager's income may grow as well. 

A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, [[songwriter]]s, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding [[Record producer|music producers]], and developing relationships with [[Record company|record companies]], publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. They should carefully consider when certain contributions have been made which would also entitle them to cowriting credits, Executive Producer credit, or Producer credit should they become involved in songwriting, financing works, or actually producing demos and recordings, and should carefully know these jobs and these fees should be considered either as separate from the contract, in addition to the contract, or as free to the musician as clarified in emails and the contract.  

The duties of an active music manager may include supporting the band's development of a reputation for the musician(s) and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, creating social network identities for bands, and booking shows. A music manager may be present during recording sessions and should support the artist during the creative process while not interfering between the artist and the producer, but musicians may also find valuable feedback in the extra pair of ears and this should be carefully considered as well. The manager may gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility.

Among all the business and professional responsibilities that music managers assume; they also become a pseudo parent for the group and help with personal matters usually. This is both for the psyche of the group and to ensure that things are running smoothly.  

Early on in an artist's career, the different facets of management and [[marketing]] fall upon either the band itself or, if they have one, their manager. Because the band or artist is relatively unknown initially, promotion, booking, and touring are minimal. A new music manager begins by establishing a clear understanding of what the artist(s) want. This can be accomplished through either a written or verbal [[contract]]. A music manager's first task is to solidify all artist development aspects and then concentrate on product development.

==Management strategies==
Despite the dominant presence of digital media in the music industry, there are many typical strategies that even the most modernized managers must adhere to in order to reach the managerial goals effectively. Most of these trick-of-the-trade strategies are employed to establish and maintain connections with booking agents, promote the activities of the artist, and manage finances in order to optimize the artist's ability to book gigs, establish a fan base, and ultimately bring in revenue from their work, respectively.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

===Booking gigs===
Among the more traditional responsibilities of music managers are booking and promoting gigs for their artist(s). Managers often become known for establishing ongoing relationships with specific venues, booking one artist at the venue regularly, or several artists on their roster.&lt;ref&gt;Farrish, Bryan. Gig Booking 101 – Venue Relationships. Bryan Farrish Radio Promotion: Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of 'how-to' books have been published on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin, June 11, 2010, A Booking Strategy that Works! The DIY Musician (2010): Accessed March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet strategies===
As technology has advanced, the music industry has consequently undergone a drastic change in the way it operates. The internet has made it both easier and harder to attract the attention of fans and the press, as both outreach increase but industry saturation increases.{{cn|date=February 2015}} “The sale of pre-recorded music has diminished, but there’s so much more that’s going on. You can’t focus on what’s not working when there are so many other opportunities.”.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson, Don and Dan Kimpel. “Chapter 6: The Manager.” In It All Begins With The Music. Boston: Course Technology/Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; Social media is a common form of online networking for managers, and platforms such as [[MySpace]], [[Facebook]], [[Beatport]], [[Bandcamp]], [[SoundCloud]], and [[YouTube]] have been noted in the press for their use in networking in the music industry.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Bryan. Music Marketing with Social Media in Only 30 Minutes a Day. The DIY Musician (2012): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Other fields such as business may use more common websites such as [[LinkedIn]] or [[Google+]], while networking on behalf of a client.{{cn|date=February 2015}}

Not everyone is so optimistic about the role of social media in the music industry. In his article, “Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media”, Wes Davenport suggests that the role of social media in the industry “has been grossly inflated”. In the article, Davenport quotes Jon Ostrow saying, “Social media is a conversation tool – that’s it”, acknowledging that there is potential for sparking conversation and building a fan base, but suggesting that social media does not necessarily live up to the potential for success that people in our modern culture seem to give credit.&lt;ref&gt;Davenport, Wes. Why Music Won’t Be Saved By Social Media. Hypebot.com (2013): Accessed March 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital case Study: Lady Gaga===
In an article titled, “Case study: Making money from music” by Martin Kupp, [[Jamie Anderson (scientist)|Jamie Anderson]] and Joerg Reckhenrich, the effects of technological advances on the music industry are recognized, analyzed, and utilized through an online marketing strategy that led to the incredible success of [[Lady Gaga]]. [[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]] of Coalition Media signed Gaga with the intention of making her into a star with the help of some clever marketing. Recognizing that digitalization was the cause of the almost 33% decrease in the music industry’s total revenue between the years 2000 and 2007, Carter decided to find a way to use digitalization to his advantage with his newly signed artist. Coalition Media, with the help of marketing company ThinkTank Digital, invested large amounts of time and money into developing Lady Gaga’s global presence through social media. 

They set up many interviews with [[Bloggers|online bloggers]], established a large following on Myspace through “constant news updates, as well as [[:wikt:exclusive|exclusives]], [[interviews]] and special features” and Gaga personally handled her Twitter account, building a very personal connection with many of her fans. This strategy demonstrates the massive success that skillful online marketing can produce. The article focuses on Coalition Media and [[Lady Gaga]]’s utilization of the “Four E’s”: [[Emotions]], [[Experiences]], [[:wikt:engage|Engaging]], and [[:wikt:exclusive|Exclusive]]. By personalizing her online activity, creating an experience, engaging, and providing exclusivity to her fans through social media marketing, [[Lady Gaga]] was able to achieve incredible levels of success with her music career.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Kupp, Jamie Anderson and Joerg Reckhenrich. Case Study: Making Money From Music. The Financial Times LTD (2011): Accessed March 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compensation==
Striking a tentative compensation agreement that can be renegotiated after three or four months is recommended, and the rate of pay is generally based on [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s of 20-80 percent, or more, of performance and commercial incomes.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This amount depends on the level of development the band or artist is at and the experience, networks and resources of the manager. (The less developed the artist and more experienced the manager, the higher the commission.) The artist or band should never agree to circumstances that cannot be terminated or negotiated within a short period of time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapositiveradio.com/general/dir/band_manager Band Manager Info at Media Positive Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Managers usually secure the services of a professional [[photographer]] while the artist is recording. Different 8x10 pictures of the artist can be used for websites, [[compact disc|CD]] labels/jackets, posters, and the [[press kit]]. Cost for high quality shoots vary from $500 for a basic shoot to thousands for several looks. Photographers are not expected to cover material cost. It is important that the manager obtains an agreement upfront confirming license to use the images which will cover the uses necessary, in addition to high resolution digital images on CD.  Managers are also advised to have photographs taken before CD designs or artwork goes into production.  Managers are also responsible for hiring additional staff when necessary.

'''''The Awakening Conscience''''' (1853) is an [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas]] painting by the English artist [[William Holman Hunt]], one of the founders of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], which depicts a young woman rising from her position in the lap of a man and gazing transfixed out of the window of a room.

The painting is in the collection of the [[Tate Britain]] in London.

==Subject matter==
Initially, the painting appears to depict a momentary disagreement between husband and wife, but the title and a host of symbols within the painting make it clear that this is a mistress and her lover. The woman's clasped hands provide a focal point and the position of her left hand emphasizes the absence of a wedding ring. Around the room are dotted reminders of her "kept" status and her wasted life: the cat beneath the table toying with a bird; the clock concealed under glass; a tapestry which hangs unfinished on the piano; the threads which lie unravelled on the floor; the print of [[Frank Stone (painter)|Frank Stone]]'s ''Cross Purposes'' on the wall; [[Edward Lear]]'s musical arrangement of [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]]'s poem "[[Tears, Idle Tears]]" which lies discarded on the floor, and the music on the piano, [[Thomas Moore]]'s "Oft in the Stilly Night", the words of which speak of missed opportunities and sad memories of a happier past. The discarded glove and top hat thrown on the table top suggest a hurried assignation.

The room is too cluttered and gaudy to be in a Victorian family home; the bright colours, unscuffed carpet, and pristine, highly polished furniture speak of a room recently furnished for a mistress. Art historian [[Elizabeth Prettejohn]] notes that although the interior is now viewed as "Victorian" it still exudes the "'nouveau-riche' vulgarity" that would have made the setting distasteful to contemporary viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Prettejohn 2000, p.94&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting's frame is decorated with further symbols: bells (for warning), marigolds (for sorrow), and a star above the girl's head (a sign of spiritual revelation). It also bears a verse from the [[Book of Proverbs]] (25:20): "As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=6996&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=10 Tate], Short Text.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mirror on the rear wall provides a tantalizing glimpse out of the scene. The window — opening out onto a spring garden, in direct contrast to the images of entrapment within the room — is flooded with sunlight. The woman's face does not display a look of shock that she has been surprised with her lover; whatever attracts her is outside of both the room and her relationship. The ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenæum]]'' commented in 1854:

{{quote|The author of "The Bridge of Sighs" could not have conceived a more painful-looking face. The details of the picture, the reflection of the spring trees in the mirror, the piano, the bronze under the lamp, are wonderfully true, but the dull indigoes and reds of the picture make it melancholy and appropriate, and not pleasing in tone. The sentiment is of the Ernest Maltravers School: to those who have an affinity for it, painful; to those who have not, repulsive.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt vol.1 p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;"[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]" was a poem by [[Thomas Hood]] about a prostitute who commits suicide by jumping into the Thames from a bridge. ''Ernest Maltravers'' was a novel by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] about a love affair between an aristocrat and a poor girl.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Hunt Light of the World.jpg|right|thumb|''The Light of the World'']]
In some ways this painting is a companion to Hunt's Christian painting ''[[The Light of the World (painting)|The Light of the World]]'', a picture of Christ holding a lantern as he knocks on an overgrown handleless door which Hunt said represented "the obstinately shut mind".&lt;ref&gt;Hunt vol.1 p.350&lt;/ref&gt; The young woman here could be responding to that image, her conscience pricked by something outside of herself. Hunt intended this image to be ''The Light of the World'''s "material counterpart in a picture representing in actual life the manner in which the appeal of the spirit of heavenly love calls a soul to abandon a lower life."&lt;ref name="H429"&gt;Hunt p.429&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Pre-Raphaelitism and the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood'' Hunt wrote that Peggotty's search for Emily in ''[[David Copperfield]]'' had given him the idea for the composition and he began to visit "different haunts of [[fallen woman|fallen girls]]" looking for a suitable setting. He did not plan to recreate any particular scene from ''David Copperfield''; he initially wanted to capture something more general: "the loving seeker of the fallen girl coming upon the object of his search",&lt;ref name="H429" /&gt; but he reconsidered, deciding that such a meeting would engender different emotions in the girl than the repentance he wanted to show. He eventually settled on the idea that the girl's companion could be singing a song that suddenly reminded her of her former life and thereby act as the unknowing catalyst for her epiphany.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt p.430&lt;/ref&gt;

The model for the girl was [[Annie Miller]], who sat for many of the Pre-Raphaelites and to whom Hunt was engaged until 1859. The male figure may be based on [[Thomas Seddon]] or [[Augustus Egg]], both painter friends of Hunt.

==Repainting==
The look on the girl's face in the modern painting is not the look of pain and horror that viewers saw when the painting was first exhibited, and which shocked and repulsed many of the contemporary critics. The painting was commissioned by [[Thomas Fairbairn]], a Manchester industrialist and patron of the Pre-Raphaelites, after Egg discussed Hunt's ideas and possibly showed him some of the initial sketches.&lt;ref name="TIC"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=6996&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=8 Tate], Illustrated Companion.&lt;/ref&gt; Fairbairn paid Hunt 350 guineas. The painting was exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1854, along with ''The Light of the World''.  Fairbairn found himself unable to bear looking on the woman's expression day-to-day, so persuaded Hunt to soften it.  Hunt started work but fell ill and allowed the painting to be returned to Fairbairn for display at the Birmingham Society of Artists exhibition in 1856 before he was completely happy with the result. Later he was able to work on it again and confided to [[Edward Lear]] that he thought he had "materially bettered it".&lt;ref name="TIC" /&gt;{{#tag:ref|In a footnote Gissing claims that Hunt regretted agreeing to Fairbairn's request change the girl's expression.&lt;ref&gt;Gissing p.90&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} As noted in the [[spandrel]]s, Hunt retouched the painting in 1864 and again in 1886 when he repaired some work that had been carried out by a restorer in the interim.&lt;ref name="TIC" /&gt;

==Views of John Ruskin==
The Victorian art theorist [[John Ruskin]] praised ''The Awakening Conscience'' as an example  of a new direction in British art in which the narrative was created from the artist's imagination rather than chronicling an event. Ruskin's reading of the painting was also to a moral end.  In an 1854 letter to ''[[The Times]]'' defending the work, he claimed that there is "not a single object in all that room...but it becomes tragical if read rightly".&lt;ref name="RB"&gt;Ruskin in Barringer, p.96&lt;/ref&gt; He was struck by both the stark realism of the room — Hunt had hired a room in a "maison de convenance" (where lovers would take their mistresses) in order to capture the feeling — and the symbolic overtones and compared the revelation of the subjects' characters through the interiors favourably with that of [[William Hogarth]]'s ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]''.&lt;ref name="RB" /&gt; 
The "common, modern, vulgar" interior is overwhelmed by lustrous, unworn objects that will never be part of a home. To Ruskin, the exquisite detail of the painting only called attention to the inevitable ruin of the couple: "The very hem of the poor girl's dress, at which the painter has laboured so closely, thread by thread, has story in it, if we think how soon its pure whiteness may be soiled with dust and rain, her outcast feet failing in the street".&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin in Prettejohn 2005, p.111–113&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of a visual [[morality tale]], based on a single moment, influenced [[Augustus Egg]]'s 1858 series of three paintings, ''[[Past and Present (paintings)|Past and Present]]''.

==In Literature==
In Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited'', an allusion to the painting reflects the unraveling of the affair between Julia Flyte and artist Charles Ryder. 

==Provenance==
The painting was inherited by Fairbairn's son, Sir Arthur Henderson Fairbairn, 3rd Baronet. It was sold anonymously at [[Christie's]] in January 1946 and had been bought by Colin Anderson by 1947. It was donated to the [[Tate Gallery]] by Sir Colin and Lady Anderson in 1976.&lt;ref name="TIC" /&gt;

'''''The Boar Hunt''''' (Spanish - ''La caza del jabalí'') is a 1775 painting by [[Francisco de Goya]], now in [[El Escorial]]. The earliest surviving tapestry cartoon by the artist, it belongs to his first series of cartoons, intended for a series of tapestries on hunting themes for [[Charles IV of Spain|Charles, Prince of Asturias]] and [[Maria Luisa of Parma]]. Its authorship is confirmed by its dimensions in receipts for the tapestries from the Real Fábrica archives.

Goya's work was supervised by his brother in law [[Francisco Bayeu]] and Francisco's brother [[Ramón Bayeu|Ramón]]. Francesco delivered this and four other cartoons to Cornelio Vandergroten on 24 May 1775.&lt;ref&gt;GASSIER, Pierre; Juliet Wilson Bareau (1974). ''Vida y obra de Francisco Goya.''

'''''The Burning Bed''''' is both a 1980 [[non-fiction]] book by [[Faith McNulty]] about battered [[housewife]] [[Francine Hughes]], and a 1984 TV-movie adaptation written by Rose Leiman Goldemberg. The plot follows Hughes' trial for the murder of her husband, James Berlin "Mickey" Hughes, following her setting fire to the bed he was sleeping in at their [[Dansville, Michigan]] home on March 9, 1977, and thirteen years of physical [[domestic abuse]] at his hands.

==Plot==
On March 9, 1977, Francine Hughes, following thirteen years of physical [[domestic abuse]] at the hands of her husband, James Berlin "Mickey" Hughes, tells their children to put their coats on and wait for her in their car. She then pours gasoline around the bed in which Mickey is sleeping in their home in [[Dansville, Michigan]], and sets the bed afire. After the house catches fire, Hughes drives with her children to the local police station in order to confess to the act. Hughes is tried for [[first degree murder]], and is found by a jury of her peers to be not guilty by reason of [[temporary insanity]]. It is widely believed that the judge and the jury largely sympathized with Francine's plight and felt that Mickey's murder was a justifiable action.

==Film adaptation==
Having adapted the book into a made-for-television movie, Goldemberg's screenplay, ''The Burning Bed'', premiered on [[NBC]] on October 8, 1984. Directed by [[Robert Greenwald]], the film starred [[Farrah Fawcett]] as [[Francine Hughes]] and [[Paul Le Mat]] as Mickey Hughes.

The movie was filmed in [[Rosharon, Texas]]. The house that served as the Hughes' home still stands today.{{when|date=December 2012}}

===Ratings===
The movie premiered with a household share of 36.2 ranking it the 17th highest rated movie to air on network television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946-Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
Television critic [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] in his 2016 book co-written with [[Alan Sepinwall]] titled ''[[TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time|TV (The Book)]]'' named ''The Burning Bed'' as the 7th greatest American TV-movie of all time, writing that "The film was a landmark in terms of content, depicting domestic violence as an unambiguous horror and a human rights violation". Seitz also praised the performance of Fawcett as "one of the finest in the history of TV-movies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sepinwall, Alan|author2=Seitz, Matt Zoller|authorlink1=Alan Sepinwall|authorlink2=Matt Zoller Seitz|title=TV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time|date=September 2016|publisher=[[Hachette Book Group#Current publishing groups &amp; imprints|Grand Central Publishing]]|location=New York, NY|isbn=9781455588190|page=372|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

There once was a poet who was unable to do anything useful and instead spent all of his time writing poetry. Unfortunately, the poet was not particularly nice to look at and was often sent away because people could not bear to look at his ugly features. As a result, he traveled from place to place singing his poetry to people who did not listen. During his travels the poet visited a city he had never been to before and, as usual, he went immediately to the poor, because it was about them that he always wrote. When they heard his poetry they grumbled and asked why he was telling them about their woes when they already knew all about them. Then they sent him up to the palace because the Princess was blind and enjoyed listening to poetry all day.
Thrilled that he was finally wanted somewhere, the poet went to the palace immediately. Upon his arrival, the guards at the gate initially turned him away because he was not as attractive as all of the other poets that had been to see the blind Princess. Luckily, the Princess heard the poet at the gate and sensed that he was a real poet - unlike all of the princes who claimed to be poets. She took the poet by the hand and took him up to the palace where the entire court was just sitting down to lunch.
The King and Queen, however, were less than overjoyed by the poets sudden appearance in their court. Despite their attempts to convince her, the Princess was adamant that he stay. Over lunch, the poet sang a poem about the poor and the hardships that they face. When he was done, everyone was stunned, and the forty five princes who claimed to be poets stood up and left, knowing that they were not real poets. When the Queen had recovered from the surprise, she tried to persuade the Princess that the poet had to leave because he was not suitable company for a Princess. Despite her objections, the poet knew it was true and told the Princess that he had to leave.

The poet went back to traveling, and one day came to a place far away from the blind Princess and sang of his love for her to the poor. When he was done, they told him that if he kissed the Princess on each eyelid while she was sleeping, her blindness would be cured, even though she had been blind since birth. He hurried back to the palace of the blind Princess and told her parents his purpose. Although they were unsure, they were also intrigued and agreed to let him try, on the condition that he left immediately after kissing her. Conveniently, the Princess was asleep in the garden at the time and the poet was able to kiss her. When she awoke, the Princess was no longer blind and asked to see all the beauty that she had been missing. However, nothing that she saw looked beautiful to her and she instead decided that she wanted to see something ugly. When she was told that there was nothing ugly in the Palace, the Princess went outside and came upon the poet who had been unable to stay away, and looking at him she finally found beauty.

==About the Author==

[[File:Evelyn Sharp.jpg|thumb|Evelyn Sharp]]

[[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)]] born August 4, 1869, to a privileged family in London; She was the ninth of eleven children. Sharp was taught by her elder sisters before attending school in London, then attending a college in Paris in 1890. She is well known for both her children’s stories as well as her involvement as a [[suffragist]]. A versatile writer, Sharp was popular for writing schoolgirl fictions and fairy tales. Her schoolgirl tales were primarily based on her happy days in school, which Sharp recorded in her collection ''The Youngest Girl in the School''. In her fairy tales, Sharp was known to appeal to the minds of children. Her attitude towards children was not patronizing, but respectful; she treated them as creative and intelligent and appealed to this aspect in her stories. She empathized with children, and viewed adults as irrational and strange. Her fairy tales were not moralistic and instead focused on issues of the day, like her changing views of gender, class, internationalism, and peace.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V. Sharp [married name Nevinson, Evelyn Jane, (1869–1955), children's writer and suffragette], [Oxford Dictionary of National Biography], Oxford University Press 2004, online edn October 2009. Retrieved on February 6, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp also worked for the [[Manchester Guardian]] as a journalist for four decades and became the first regular contributor to its popular Women’s page. Her involvement in the suffrage movement began before the [[First World War]]. Sharp was involved in two major suffragist societies in Britain: the militant [[Women’s Social and Political Union]] and the [[United Suffragists]], the latter of which she was a founder. Sharp edited the controversial newspaper ''[[Votes for Women (newspaper)|Votes for Women]]''. Her work as a pacifist and international humanitarian lead her to work with the [[Quakers]] in [[Weimar Germany]], in the 1920s. She was twice imprisoned and refused to pay taxes on the grounds that as she did not have the vote therefore she should not have to pay. At the age of sixty-three, she married long time friend and fellow suffragist, [[Henry Nevinson]]. Sharp died in 1955 at the age of 86.&lt;ref&gt;John, Angela V. "Evelyn Sharp." : Rebel Woman 1869.

[[File:Former Festival Theatre, Cambridge Geograph-2593449-by-Keith-Edkins.jpg|thumb|Interior of the former theatre in 2011]]
The '''Theatre Royal''' was built in the Barnwell suburb of Cambridge, England, in 1816. It closed later that century but reopened as the '''Cambridge Festival Theatre''' from 1926 until 1935. The building, in which part of the interior of the theatre survives, is Grade II* listed.

== 19th century  ==
William Wilkins (1751–1815){{sfn|Searby|1988|p=699}}, a building contractor, was proprietor of a chain of theatres in East Anglia known as the Norwich circuit. Performers included the [[Norwich Company of Comedians]], and performances had been given since the late 18th century on Stourbridge Common, north of the city of Cambridge, at the annual [[Stourbridge fair]].{{sfn|Searby|1988|p=693}} Wilkins and his son, also [[William Wilkins (architect)|William]] (1778–1839), built a theatre in 1807 at Sun Street, [[Barnwell, Cambridgeshire|Barnwell]]. The younger Wilkins – a prominent architect who had designed [[Downing College, Cambridge|Downing College]] and went on to work at other colleges and the National Gallery – designed a new theatre nearby to replace the 1807 building.{{sfn|Searby|1988|p=701}}

The building is on the south side of the Newmarket Road in the northeastern Cambridge suburb of Barnwell. Completed in 1816, the theatre was sited outside the boundary of the town owing to prohibition of theatrical entertainment by the [[Cambridge University|University]] authorities&lt;ref name=listing&gt;{{National Heritage List for England|num=1126148|desc=Arts Theatre Workshop and Store|access-date=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a 1737 act "for the More Effectual Preventing the Unlawful Playing of Interludes within the Precincts of the Two Universities ..." forbade the performance of all plays and operas within five miles of the town).{{sfn|Searby|1988|pp=696–700}}

On his father's death in 1815, Wilkins inherited the leases of the new site and six other theatres – Norwich, Bury St Edmunds, Colchester, Yarmouth, Ipswich and King's Lynn{{sfn|Searby|1988|pp=696–701}} – and continued to run them. Proprietorship passed to his son, W Bushby Wilkins, and a succession of lessees, but the Norwich circuit declined.{{sfn|Searby|1988|pp=696–706}} The theatre closed in 1878 and became a [[Nonconformism|nonconformist]] chapel.&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web|title=The Festival Theatre, Cambridge|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-festival-theatre-cambridge-1568393.html|website=The Independent|date=17 January 1995|last=Davies|first=Andrew John|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cambridge Festival Theatre ==
[[Terence Gray]] (1895–1986) leased the building in 1926 and reopened it as the Cambridge Festival Theatre. The alleyway between the street and the building was enclosed to form a foyer. The interior was modernised, with the [[proscenium]] arch widened by the removal of the private boxes,&lt;ref name="Justice-Malloy2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rhona Justice-Malloy|title=Theatre History Studies 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6ioKbxcTHgC|date=9 August 2009|publisher=University of Alabama Press|isbn=978-0-8173-5554-8|pages=171–198}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the introduction of electric lighting, a brick [[cyclorama]] and an early example of a [[revolving stage]].&lt;ref name=listing /&gt; The theatre was the country's "first permanent indoor performing space to be based on the design of a Greek open-air theatre".&lt;ref name="Easterling1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. E. Easterling|title=The Cambridge Companion to Greek Tragedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_kx9eeSJyeoC|date=2 October 1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-42351-9|page=305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Festival' name reflected Grey's intention (unfulfilled) to promote summer festivals.&lt;ref name="Justice-Malloy2009" /&gt; The opening production on 22 November 1926 was ''[[Oresteia]]'', with choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]].&lt;ref name="Easterling1997" /&gt;

Grey retired from the theatre in 1933&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; and went on to write on [[Taoism]] under the pseudonym "Wei Wu Wei".  [[Norman Marshall (theatre director)|Norman Marshall]] worked at the theatre from 1926 and was its director from 1932 to 1933.

From 1927, [[Joseph Macleod]] was an actor and producer at the theatre, and in 1933 he became the theatre's director and lessee. Five of Macleod's plays were staged there, including ''Overture to Cambridge'' (1933) and ''A Woman Turned to Stone'' (1934). Under Macleod, the theatre became known for its avant-garde productions, and staging of lesser known works by great playwrights. Macleod staged some of [[Ezra Pound]]'s Noh plays, and also some [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]] and [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] (his company, The Cambridge Festival Players, was one of the first in the UK to stage Chekhov's play ''[[The Seagull]]''). The theatre was obliged to close due to financial difficulties in June 1935.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The building was recorded as [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II* listed]] in 1950.&lt;ref name=listing /&gt; From 1962 it was used by the [[Cambridge Arts Theatre|Arts Theatre]] as a workshop and store.&lt;ref name=independent /&gt;

== Today ==
[[File:Cambridge Buddhist Centre, Newmarket Road.JPG|thumb|upright|Entrance in 2013]]
The building is in use as a [[Buddhism in the United Kingdom|Buddhist]] centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cambridge Buddhist Centre|url=http://www.cambridgebuddhistcentre.com|website=|date=|accessdate=26 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historic England]] describe the interior as "a virtually complete example of a Georgian theatre with a three-tiered horsehoe auditorium with the galleries supported on cast iron columns." and state that a painting of the Royal Arms remains above the [[proscenium]].&lt;ref name=listing /&gt;

== History ==
From 1968 until 1997, Universal Creative was known as '''MCA Planning and Development''', working as part of Universal's recreation division. In 1997, when Universal parent [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] was sold to [[Seagram]] and dropped the MCA name, the company was renamed '''Universal Creative'''. Originally located in [[Universal City, California]], the company moved to [[Universal Orlando]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201702/5449/|title=A brief history of Disney's and Universal's theme park design divisions|website=Theme Park Insider|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Comcast]] purchased [[NBCUniversal]], incorporating [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts]] and Universal Creative into its portfolio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comcast completes NBC Universal merger |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-comcast-nbc/comcast-completes-nbc-universal-merger-idUSTRE70S2WZ20110129 |website=Reuters |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=September 6, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
Universal Creative designed and created attractions such as [[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]] (1999), [[Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey]] (2010), and [[Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts]] (2014), and has numerous patents on file for additional attractions and innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://orlandoinformer.com/blog/universal-patents-predict-future-theme-parks|title=6 Universal Patents Predict the Future of Theme Parks|date=2016-12-19|work=Orlando Informer|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thierry Coup]], Universal Creative’s Senior Vice President of the Creative Studio, describes the philosophy: {{block quote|When people come to our park, a lot of them ask ‘How did they do that?’ It’s what we want to hear. But as they become more savvy, we have to keep improving and staying on the cutting edge. We look at up-and-coming technology, because developing an attraction at this level requires the use of tricks, techniques and technology that exists, and then we have to bring it to the next level. Often production systems we use for attractions are not available commercially yet. We work with technology partners to look at the future and see how we’re going to incorporate that into our attractions, to immerse our guests in a way that they’ve never dreamed about.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottkramer/2016/03/08/the-magic-of-universal-orlando-revealing-the-technology-behind-the-rides/#59ffcf83bd0b|title=The Magic of Universal Orlando: Revealing the Technology Behind the Rides|last=Kramer|first=Scott|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man ===
[[File:The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man entrance 1.jpg|alt=Entrance to The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man|thumb|upright|Entrance to The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man at [[Marvel Super Hero Island]] at [[Islands of Adventure]]]]
Universal Creative's The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man is a dark ride using advanced audio, with the sound accurate to ⅕ of a video frame.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.themeparktourist.com/features/20170519/32767/modern-marvels-amazing-adventures-spider-man|title=This Amazing Adventure May be One of the Best Rides Ever Built. Here's the Inside Scoop.|date=2017-05-21|work=Theme Park Tourist|access-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; “All of your visceral, aural and visual input has to be in perfect sync,” says Steve Blum, Senior Vice President of Ride Safety and Engineering. “Humans are very sensitive to anomalies in their environment: If you don’t give them the right input, they detect right away that it’s not real.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottkramer/2016/03/08/the-magic-of-universal-orlando-revealing-the-technology-behind-the-rides/#7435e2fbd0b8|title=The Magic of Universal Orlando: Revealing the Technology Behind the Rides|last=Kramer|first=Scott|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Universal Creative partnered with [[Oceaneering International]] to create a 12-passenger motion-base simulator pod capable of six degrees of freedom (heave, sway, surge, yaw, pitch, and roll) and 360-degree rotation (achieved with a ring and pinion gear system), all contained in an angled shell to direct riders' view. Universal Creative’s [[Phil Hettema]] and William Mason received inventor credits on the ride system patent, known as the SCOOP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Universal Creative employees Scott Trowbridge and Thierry Coup storyboarded a scene-by-scene breakdown of the ride that would be projected onto thirteen 30-foot tall projection screens integrated with physical sets. Because guests would be moving toward, away from, or past these 3D screens, animators had to consider the perspective shift that viewers would actually encounter if these really. They developed a new process they called “squinching”, used to account for a viewer’s moving sightline and distorting the animation to match.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Created for the [[Islands of Adventure]] theme park that opened on May 28, 1999, The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man won ''[[Amusement Today]]''{{'}}s [[Golden Ticket Award]] for Best Dark Ride for twelve consecutive years from 1999 through to 2010. It has since placed second in that category, after fellow Islands of Adventure attraction, [[Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey]], took the top spot in 2011. In 2000, the ride won a Thea Award from the [[Themed Entertainment Association]] for outstanding themed entertainment and experience design. It has also won numerous public-voted Theme Park Insider Awards and Screamscape Ultimate Awards. The ride has been duplicated a [[Universal Studios Japan]], which opened in January 2004.

=== Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey ===
[[File:Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey (16388460902).jpg|thumb|Exterior Facade of Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey]]
Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey opened in June 2010 as part of the Hogsmeade area at Islands of Adventure. It features robotic arms as a ride vehicle which are mounted on a track, to travel through the attraction while performing their movements in synchronization with the ride's show elements (animated props, projection surfaces, and so on).&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://parkpedia.wordpress.com/harry-potter-and-the-forbidden-journey/|title=Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey|date=2012-02-23|work=Parkpedia|access-date=2017-09-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Amusement Today]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s annual [[Golden Ticket Awards]], Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey debuted as the best new ride of 2010. It won the Best Dark Ride category for five consecutive years from 2011 to 2015.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Due to the massive popularity of the ride, it was duplicated at [[Universal Studios Japan]] (which opened on July 18, 2014) and [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] (which opened on April 7, 2016).

=== Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts ===
Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts is a [[steel roller coaster]] that opened on July 8, 2014 at [[Universal Studios Florida]]. It encompasses motion-based vehicles, detailed sets, physical effects, and [[3D film|3D]] projection screens similar to those found on ''[[Transformers: The Ride 3D]]'' and ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]''. The ride takes guests through the vaults of Gringotts, where they meet several characters from the ''Harry Potter'' films and have a face-to-face encounter with [[Lord Voldemort]] and [[Bellatrix LeStrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]] In ''[[Amusement Today]]'''s annual [[Golden Ticket Awards]], Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts has made it into the Top Five Dark Rides since it opened in 2014.

'''Wesley Lawrence Willis''' (May 31, 1963&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;August 21, 2003) was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and [[visual arts|visual artist]]. Diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]] in 1989, Willis began a career as an [[underground music|underground]] [[singer-songwriter]] in the [[outsider music]] tradition, with songs featuring his bizarre, humorous and often obscene lyrics sung over the [[Electronic keyboard#Concepts and definitions|auto accompaniment]] feature on his [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] KN [[electronic keyboard|keyboard]].&lt;ref name=joyrides&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wesleywillissjoyrides.com/WesleyWillisBio.htm |title=Wesley Willis's Joy Rides · Wesley Willis Bio |publisher=Wesleywillissjoyrides.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004231454/http://wesleywillissjoyrides.com/WesleyWillisBio.htm |archive-date=2013-10-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=alttent&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419030840/http://www.alternativetentacles.com/bandinfo.php?band=wesleywillis |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-04-19 |title=Bands |publisher=Alternative Tentacles |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ymarks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ymarksthespot.org/2010/07/31/say-rah-discussing-the-daddy-of-rock-n-roll-with-the-directors-of-wesley-williss-joy-rides-2/ |title=Say Rah!

Willis gained a large [[cult following]] in the 1990s, particularly after the release of his 1995 ''Greatest Hits'' album on the [[Alternative Tentacles]] label. [[Jello Biafra]] compiled the album's track list.&lt;ref name=alttent /&gt;&lt;ref name=ymarks /&gt; In addition to a large body of solo musical work, Willis fronted his own [[punk rock]] band, the [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]], during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ymarks /&gt; He was also a visual artist long before he developed an interest in music, and produced hundreds of intricate, unusual, colored ink-pen drawings,&lt;ref name=ymarks /&gt; most of them of various Chicago streetscapes; he frequently sold these on the street for between $20 and $40.&lt;ref name=joyrides /&gt;

Despite his mainly underground career, Willis has influenced a variety of media: for example, music software company [[Nullsoft]] took their slogan "It really whips the llama's ass!" for [[Winamp]] from Willis's song "Whip The Llama's Ass".&lt;ref name="AutoMZ-17"&gt;DEMO.MP3 15,592 bytes, 32 kbit/s, 22 kHz, recorded in "1997" "Exclusively for Nullsoft" by JJ McKay.

During childhood, Willis developed an interest in art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago [[public-access television|public access]] documentary feature entitled ''Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets''.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite news|title=Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets|last=Hart|first=Carl|publisher=Chicago Public Access TV|accessdate=7 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Artist of the Streets'', he was shown walking through Chicago's [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] neighborhood, producing his [[fountain pen|ink pen]] drawings outside of the [[Marshall Field and Company Building]], and interacting with people curious about his art.&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis was known for his ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the one in which he was sitting.&lt;ref name="Daddy"/&gt; During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the [[Mohamed Khalil Museum]] of Egypt, and he was the subject of a special exhibit entitled ''Drawn By Wesley Willis'' at [[Dominican University (Illinois)|Dominican University]].&lt;ref name="avc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/chicago/articles/its-drawn-by-wesley-willis,520/|title=It's drawn by Wesley Willis|last=Wolinsky|first=David|date=February 21, 2008|work=The A.V.

In 1991, after befriending some musicians from Chicago's alternative rock scene and recording several solo albums, he formed the punk rock band The [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]]. The band developed a popular underground following as well as attention from musicians such as [[Eddie Vedder]], [[Henry Rollins]], [[Mike D.]], [[Jello Biafra]], and the members of [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]];&lt;ref name="BG"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://scholarworks.bgsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7023&amp;context=bg-news|title=Wesley Willis Fiasco uses music for inner peace|last=Weisbrod|first=Aaron|date=June 26, 1996|work=The BG News|page=6|accessdate=8 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon caught the attention of [[Rick Rubin]] at [[American Recordings (record label)|American Recordings]],&lt;ref name="BG"/&gt; an independent label distributed by [[Warner Bros.|The Warner Group]]. In early 1994, Willis recorded with the [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[industrial music|industrial]]-[[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Monster Voodoo Machine]] and appeared on their Juno Award-winning debut album ''Suffersystem'' ([[RCA Records]]). In 1995, American Recordings signed Willis as a solo musician; the Wesley Willis Fiasco subsequently broke up in 1996. He went on to record numerous solo albums of [[novelty song|novelty rock]] (two for American Recordings and the remainder for several independent labels or recorded, marketed and released independently by Willis himself), toured frequently, and was profiled on [[MTV]].&lt;ref name="mtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1477150/wesley-willis-schizophrenic-street-singer-dies/|title=Wesley Willis, Schizophrenic Street Singer, Dies|work=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 26, 1996, he was a guest on ''[[Howard Stern|The Howard Stern Show]]'' where he played nearly identical songs about [[Baba Booey]] and [[Howard Stern]]. During his many tours and live appearances, Willis became "famous for greeting fans with a headbutt"; this left him with a distinctive permanent bruise on his forehead.&lt;ref name="mtv"/&gt;

In early 2003 the documentary ''[[The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll]]'' was released, chronicling Willis' daily life and interests.

On August 21, 2003, Willis died due to complications from [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]] in [[Skokie, Illinois]].&lt;ref name=alttent /&gt;

In 2013, a supporting character named Milan was introduced for the ongoing [[Wonder Woman]] comic. A blind demigod with the power of far-sight and half-brother to Wonder Woman, his physical appearance and mannerisms are based on Wesley Willis.&lt;ref name ="hufpo"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/07/wesley-willis-wonder-woma_n_2639862.html|title=Wesley Willis Wonder Woman: Iconic Artist Appears In New DC Comic As Heroine's Half-Brother|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Song structure and themes==
"Hellride" is the term used by Willis to describe his encounters with "[[demon]]s",&lt;ref name=monzy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monzy.org/wesley/ |title=Wesley Willis |publisher=Monzy.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which occurred mainly on the [[Chicago Transit Authority|CTA]] bus lines in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name="Daddy"/&gt; According to Willis, his demons were trying to ruin his "Harmony Joy Music" or "Joy Rides".&lt;ref name=alttent /&gt; He uses the term in many of his songs, such as "I Deserve a Warhellride".

The [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]] songs were [[punk rock]] songs with Willis howling his obscene, absurd rants as lyrics. The band recorded three cover songs: [[Thin Lizzy]]'s "Jailbreak",&lt;ref name="hbd"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=207448 |title=Various Artists: Vagabonds of the Midwestern World: Fighting Songs by Thin Lizzy - A - HBDirect Rock |publisher=Hbdirect.com |date=2003-01-03 |accessdate=2013-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508030604/http://www.hbdirect.com/album_detail.php?pid=207448 |archive-date=2014-05-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pure Prairie League]]'s "[[Bustin' Out|Amie]]", and [[Duran Duran]]'s "[[Girls on Film]]", the last of which was recorded for a 1997 Duran Duran [[tribute album]]. Another song by the Wesley Willis Fiasco, "The Bar Is Closed", recreates a section of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s "Tom Sawyer"; the song "Casper the Homosexual Friendly Ghost" does the same with [[Van Halen]]'s "Jamie's Cryin'".

As a solo artist, Willis filled his albums with funny, bizarre, tense, and often obscene statements about crime, fast food, cultural trends, bus routes, violent confrontations with [[superhero]]es, commands for his "demons" to engage in [[bestiality]] (in ''[[The Daddy of Rock 'n' Roll]]'', Willis explained that these songs would "gross out" the demons enough to leave him alone),&lt;ref name="Daddy"/&gt; and praise for his favorite actors, friends, politicians, and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[rock music|rock]] artists. Songs about rock artists were usually confined to describing a show performed by the band that Willis had attended or opened for, recycling key phrases such as "The crowd roared like a lion," "A lot of people met the band," or "The band got down like a [[Magikist]]". Many songs end with the phrase "Rock over [[London]], rock on, Chicago," followed by a product slogan, such as "[[Wheaties]]. Breakfast of Champions" or "[[Blockbuster LLC|Blockbuster]]. Wow! What a difference."

Critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] wrote that despite Willis' prolific output his songs were essentially variations on the same simple structure, melody and lyrical themes. He also questioned record company motives for releasing albums by Willis: "It's certainly admirable that Willis has decided to not be tied down by his schizophrenia, but it often seems that his audience is laughing at him, not with him."&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"&gt;https://www.allmusic.com/album/feel-the-power-mw0000648886&lt;/ref&gt; Erlewine also wrote that listening to a Willis record felt "exploitive".&lt;ref name="allmusic.com"/&gt;
