'''104''' ('''one hundred [and] four''') is the [[natural number]] following [[103 (number)|103]] and preceding [[105 (number)|105]]. 

== In mathematics ==
104 is a [[primitive semiperfect number]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oeis.org/A006036|title=Sloane's A006036 : Primitive pseudoperfect numbers|last=|first=|date=|website=The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences|publisher=OEIS Foundation|access-date=2016-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[composite number]], with its [[divisor]]s being 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, 26, 52 and 104. As it has 8 divisors total, and 8 is one of those divisors, 104 is a [[refactorable number]]. The distinct prime factors of 104 add up to 15, and so do the ones of 105, hence the two numbers form a [[Ruth-Aaron pair]] under the first definition.

In regular [[geometry]], 104 is the smallest number of unit line segments that can exist in a plane with four of them touching at every [[Vertex (geometry)|vertex]].

==In science==
*The [[atomic number]] of [[rutherfordium]].
*Number of degrees Fahrenheit corresponding to 40 Celsius.

==In other fields==
'''104''' is also:
*The number of Corinthian columns in the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Temple of Olympian Zeus]], the largest temple ever built in [[Greece]].
*The number of guns on Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]]'s flagship [[HMS Victory]].
*The number of keys on a [[Computer keyboard#Standard|standard Windows keyboard]].
*The number of Symphonies written by [[Joseph Haydn]] upon which numbers are agreed (though in fact, he wrote more: see [[list of symphonies by Joseph Haydn]]).
*[[Cent Quatre]], an arts centre in Paris.

* [[List of highways numbered 104]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2987">In [[model theory]], the '''age''' of a [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] (or model) ''A'' is the class of all finitely generated structures that are [[Embedding|embeddable]] in ''A'' (i.e. isomorphic to substructures of ''A''). This concept is central in the construction of a [[Roland Fraisse|Fraïssé]] limit.

The main point of Fraïssé's construction is to show how one can approximate a structure by its finitely generated substructures. Thus for example the age of any [[List of first-order theories#Orders|dense linear order without endpoints]] (DLO), 
&lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbb{Q},&lt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is precisely the set of all [[Wikt:finite|finite]] linear orderings, which are distinguished up to isomorphism only by their size. Thus the age of any DLO is [[countable]]. This shows in a way that a DLO is a kind of limit of finite linear orderings. 

One can easily see that any class ''K'' that is an age of some structure satisfies the following two conditions:

;Hereditary property: If ''A''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''K'' and ''B'' is a finitely generated substructure of ''A'', then ''B'' is isomorphic to a structure in ''K''

;[[Joint embedding property]]: If ''A'' and ''B'' are in ''K'' then there is ''C'' in ''K'' such that both ''A'' and ''B'' are embeddable in ''C''. 

Fraïssé proved the converse result: when ''K'' is any non-empty countable set of finitely generated σ-structures (with σ a [[signature (logic)|signature]]) that has the above two properties, then it is an age of a countable structure.

Furthermore, suppose that ''K'' happens to satisfy the following additional property.

;[[Amalgamation property]]: For any structures ''A, B'' and ''C'' in ''K'' such that ''A'' is embeddable in both ''B'' and ''C'', there exists ''D'' in ''K'' to which ''B'' and ''C'' are both embeddable by embeddings that coincide on the image of ''A'' in both structures.

In that case, there is a unique countable structure, up to isomorphism, that has age ''K'' and is homogeneous. In this context, 'homogeneous' means that any isomorphism between two finitely generated substructures can be extended to an automorphism of the whole structure. Again, an example of this situation is the ordered set of rational numbers &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbb{Q},&lt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. It is the ''unique'' (up to isomorphism) homogeneous countable structure whose age is the set of all finite linear orderings. Note that the ordered set of natural numbers &lt;math&gt;\langle\mathbb{N},&lt;\rangle&lt;/math&gt; has the same age as a DLO, but it is not homogeneous since if we map {1,&amp;nbsp;3} to {5,&amp;nbsp;6}, it would not extend to any automorphism ''f'' since there should be an element between &lt;math&gt;f(1)=5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(3)=6&lt;/math&gt;. The same applies to integers.

In [[complex analysis]], a branch of [[mathematics]], an '''amoeba''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] associated with a [[polynomial]] in one or more [[several complex variables|complex variables]]. Amoebas have applications in [[algebraic geometry]], especially [[tropical geometry]].

==Definition==
Consider the function

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Log}: \left({\mathbb C}\backslash\{0\}\right)^n \to \mathbb R^n&lt;/math&gt;

defined on the set of all ''n''-[[tuple]]s &lt;math&gt;z=(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)&lt;/math&gt; of non-zero [[complex number]]s with values in the [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n,&lt;/math&gt; given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Log}(z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n)= (\log |z_1|, \log|z_2|, \dots, \log |z_n|).\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here, 'log' denotes the [[natural logarithm]]. If ''p''(''z'') is a polynomial in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; complex variables, its '''amoeba''' &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal A}_p&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[image (mathematics)|image]] of the set of [[root of a function|zeros]] of ''p'' under Log, so

: &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal A}_p = \left\{\mathrm{Log} (z) \, : \, z\in \left({\mathbb C}\backslash\{0\}\right)^n, p(z)=0\right\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Amoebas were introduced in 1994 in a book by [[Israel Gelfand|Gelfand]], Kapranov, and [[Andrei Zelevinsky|Zelevinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

* Any amoeba is a [[closed set]].
* Any [[connected space|connected component]] of the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R^n\backslash {\mathcal A}_p&lt;/math&gt; is [[convex set|convex]].&lt;ref name=IMS3&gt;Itenberg et al (2007) p.3&lt;/ref&gt;
* The area of an amoeba of a not identically zero polynomial in two complex variables is finite.
* A two-dimensional amoeba has a number of "tentacles" which are infinitely long and exponentially narrow towards infinity.

==Ronkin function==

A useful tool in studying amoebas is the '''Ronkin function'''&lt;!--, named after ??????? Ronkin--&gt;. For ''p''(''z'') a polynomial in ''n'' complex variables, one defines the Ronkin function

: &lt;math&gt;N_p:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;

by the formula

: &lt;math&gt;N_p(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi i)^n}\int_{\mathrm{Log}^{-1}(x)}\log|p(z)| \,\frac{dz_1}{z_1} \wedge  \frac{d z_2}{z_2}\wedge\cdots \wedge \frac{d z_n}{z_n},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; denotes &lt;math&gt;x=(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n).&lt;/math&gt; Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; is given by the integral

: &lt;math&gt;N_p(x)=\frac{1}{(2\pi)^n}\int_{[0, 2\pi]^n}\log|p(z)| \,d\theta_1\,d\theta_2 \cdots d\theta_n,&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;z=\left(e^{x_1+i\theta_1}, e^{x_2+i\theta_2}, \dots, e^{x_n+i\theta_n}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The Ronkin function is convex, and it is [[affine function|affine]] on each connected component of the complement of the amoeba of &lt;math&gt;p(z)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Gross | first=Mark | chapter=Amoebas of complex curves and tropical curves | zbl=1083.14061 | editor1-last=Guest | editor1-first=Martin | title=UK-Japan winter school 2004—Geometry and analysis towards quantum theory.

As an example, the Ronkin function of a [[monomial]]

: &lt;math&gt;p(z)=az_1^{k_1}z_2^{k_2}\dots z_n^{k_n}\, &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;a\ne 0&lt;/math&gt; is

: &lt;math&gt;N_p(x) = \log|a|+k_1x_1+k_2x_2+\cdots+k_nx_n.\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2541">The '''Andronov&amp;ndash;Pontryagin criterion''' is a necessary and sufficient condition for the stability of [[dynamical system]]s in the plane. It was derived by [[Aleksandr Andronov]] and [[Lev Pontryagin]] in 1937.

==Statement==

A dynamical system

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{x} = v(x), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;C^{1}&lt;/math&gt;-[[vector field]] on the [[Euclidean plane|plane]], &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb{R}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, 
is [[topological conjugacy|orbitally topologically stable]] if and only if the following two conditions hold:

# All [[equilibrium point]]s and [[periodic orbit]]s are ''hyperbolic''.
# There are no ''saddle connections''.

The same statement holds if the vector field &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is defined on the [[unit disk]] and is transversal to the boundary.

==Clarifications==

'''Orbital topological stability''' of a dynamical system means that for any sufficiently small perturbation (in the ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-metric), there exists a [[homeomorphism]] close to the identity map which transforms the orbits of the original dynamical system to the orbits of the perturbed system (cf [[structural stability]]).

The first condition of the theorem is known as '''global hyperbolicity'''.  A zero of a vector field ''v'', i.e. a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; where ''v''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)=0, is said to be '''hyperbolic''' if none of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the linearization of ''v'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is purely imaginary. A periodic orbit of a flow is said to be hyperbolic if none of the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Poincaré map|Poincaré return map]] at a point on the orbit has absolute value one.

Finally, '''saddle connection''' refers to a situation where an orbit from one saddle point enters the same or another saddle point, i.e. the unstable and stable [[separatrix (mathematics)|separatrices]] are connected (cf [[homoclinic orbit]] and [[heteroclinic orbit]]).

'''Anne Penfold Street''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AM}} (1932–2016) was one of Australia's leading mathematicians,{{r|wisenet}} specialising in [[combinatorics]]. She was the third woman to become a mathematics professor in Australia, following [[Hanna Neumann]] and [[Cheryl Praeger]].{{r|apsa|bcc}} She was the author of several textbooks,{{r|vale}}
and her work on [[sum-free set]]s became a standard reference for its subject matter.{{r|payne}} She helped found several important organizations in combinatorics, developed a researcher network, and supported young students with interest in mathematics.{{r|vale}}

==Early life and education==
Street was born on 11 October 1932 in [[Melbourne]],{{r|eas}} the daughter of a medical researcher.{{r|wisenet}} She earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the [[University of Melbourne]] in 1954,{{r|eas|praeger}} while working there as a tutor in chemistry{{r|eas}} and also studying mathematics.{{r|praeger}} She finished a master's degree in chemistry at Melbourne in 1956.{{r|vale|eas|donovan}} During this time she married another Melbourne chemist, Norman Street, and in 1957 the Streets and their young daughter  moved to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] where Norman Street had a new job.{{r|praeger}}

At Illinois, Street took up mathematics again.{{r|praeger}} After moving to [[Mildura]] and then returning to Urbana, she completed her doctorate at the University of Illinois in 1966, with a dissertation on [[group theory]] supervised by [[Michio Suzuki]].{{r|donovan|mgp|ica}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4305">The '''bipartite realization problem''' is a classical [[decision problem]] in [[graph theory]], a branch of [[combinatorics]]. Given two finite sequences &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\dots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers, the problem asks whether there is labeled [[bipartite graph|simple bipartite graph]] such that &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\dots,a_n),(b_1,\dots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[bipartite graph|degree sequence]] of this bipartite graph.

==Solutions==
The problem belongs to the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]]. This can be proven using the [[Gale–Ryser theorem]], i.e. one has to validate the correctness of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; inequalities.

==Other notations==
The problem can also be stated in terms of zero-one [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]]. The connection can be seen if one realizes that each [[bipartite graph]] has an [[Adjacency matrix of a bipartite graph|biadjacency matrix]] where the column sums and row sums correspond to &lt;math&gt;(a_1,\ldots,a_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(b_1,\ldots,b_n)&lt;/math&gt;. The problem is then often denoted by ''0-1-matrices for given row and column sums''. In the classical literature the problem was sometimes stated in the context of [[contingency table]]s by ''contingency tables with given marginals''. A third formulation is in terms of [[directed graph|degree sequence]]s of simple directed graphs with at most one loop per vertex. In this case the matrix is interpreted as the [[directed graph|adjacency matrix]] of such a directed graph. When are pairs of non-negative integers ((''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;),&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;(''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;,''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) the indegree-outdegree pairs of a labeled directed graph with at most one loop per vertex?

==Related problems==
Similar problems describe the [[Degree (graph theory)|degree sequence]]s of [[Graph (discrete mathematics)#Simple graph|simple graphs]] and [[directed graph|simple directed graphs]]. The first problem is the so-called [[graph realization problem]]. The second is known as the [[digraph realization problem]]. The bipartite realization problem is equivalent to the question, if there exists a labeled bipartite [[bipartite graph|subgraph]] of a [[complete bipartite graph]] to a given degree sequence. The ''hitchcock problem'' asks for such a subgraph minimizing the sum of the costs on each edge which are given for the complete bipartite graph. A further generalization is the [[b-matching|f-factor problem for bipartite graphs]], i.e. for a given bipartite graph one searches for a subgraph possessing a certain degree sequence. The problem ''uniform sampling a bipartite graph to a fixed degree sequence'' is to construct a solution for the bipartite realization problem with the additional constraint that each such solution comes with the same probability. This problem was shown to be in [[Polynomial-time approximation scheme|FPTAS]] for [[sequence (graph theory)|regular sequences]] by [[Catherine Greenhill]] &lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Greenhill|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for regular bipartite graphs with a forbidden [[Graph factorization |1-factor]]) and for [[sequence (graph theory)|half-regular sequences]] by Erdős et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Erdős|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The general problem has still been unsolved.

The '''California Mathematics Project''' ('''CMP''') is a [[K–16]] network in [[California]], [[United States]], dedicated to providing students a rich, rigorous, and coherent [[mathematics]] curriculum taught by competent and confident mathematics teachers who foster all students’ proficiency in mathematics—achieving equity in quality.{{fact|date=November 2016}}

==Overview==
CMP enhances teachers’ mathematical content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge that is aligned to the ''California Mathematics Standards and Framework''. All teachers and students become competent mathematical thinkers as they investigate, conjecture, and justify.

;Mission
{{cquote|
''The mission of the California Mathematics Project (CMP) is to develop and enhance K–12 teachers' content knowledge and instructional strategies aligned with the California State Board of Education adopted California Mathematics Content Standards and Framework. ''{{fact|date=November 2016}}
}}

==History==
The roots of the CMP can be traced back to the Bay Area Writing Project (BAWP), a professional development project for teachers or writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Suzanne|title=California Dreaming: Reforming Mathematic Education|year=2003|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-09432-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BAWP was established in 1974 by James Grey at the University of California, Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bay Area Writing Project|url=http://www.bayareawritingproject.org/bawp/|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CMP was created in 1982 by legislative act SB 424 (Carpenter) to "seek to solve the mathematics skills problem of students in California through cooperatively planned and funded efforts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=California Postsecondary Education Commission|title=Evaluation of the California Mathematics Project|year=1986|url=http://www.cpec.ca.gov/CompleteReports/1986Reports/86-34.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time nine sites were funded throughout the state.  The [[University of California]] was vested with authority to manage and control the projects. The [[California Postsecondary Education Commission]] (CPEC) was to evaluate the projects. Judy Kysh was hired in 1984 as a part-time statewide coordinator. In 1986, it was decided that there needed to be a full-time statewide Executive Director to oversee the CMP.

In 1987, CPEC commissioned a policy study to analyze the effectiveness of professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Little|first=Judith Warren|title=Staff development in California: Public and personal investments, program patterns, and policy choices|year=1987|publisher=Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|location=San Francisco, CA|url=http://www.cpec.ca.gov/CompleteReports/1988Reports/88-22.pdf|author2=William H. Gerritz |author3=David S. Stern |author4=James W. Guthrie |author5=Michael W. Kirst |author6=David D. Marsh }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers identified four characteristics of effective professional development:

# discipline and grade-level specific
# organized by the central premise of teachers teaching teachers
# focus on knowledge rooted in teaching that produces high levels of student achievement
# long-term and explicit goals linked to student learning

Following this report, in 1989 the California legislature created a professional development program expanding the structure of the California Writing Project (CWP) and CMP to embrace nine subject areas called the California Subject Matter Projects (CSMP). "The CMP model is one of long-term, sustained professional development, in contrast to a conference or a "one-shot" workshop.  Experienced and interested teacher leaders often assume leadership roles at the project site."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Developing Teacher Leaders: Professional Development in Science and Mathematics|year=2001|publisher=ERIC Clearinghouse for Science, Mathematics, and Environmental Education|location=Columbus, OH|isbn=978-0-88119-000-7 |page=159|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED451031.pdf| first=Carol Fry | last=Bohlin| chapter=Chapter 8: Teacher Leadership Development as a Critical Component of Systemic Reform: the San Joaquin Valley Mathematics Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By eliminating the potential for data to be viewed by service providers (or third parties that compel service providers to deliver access to data), client-side encryption ensures that data and files that are stored in the cloud can only be viewed on the client side of the exchange. This prevents data loss and the unauthorized disclosure of private or personal files, providing increased peace of mind for its users.&lt;ref name=infosectoday/&gt;

Current academic scholarship as well as recommendations by industry professionals provide much support for developers to include client-side encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of information.&lt;ref name="Chandra2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Deka, Ganesh Chandra |title=Handbook of Research on Securing Cloud-Based Databases with Biometric Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iiKXBQAAQBAJ |accessdate=21 February 2016 |date=31 October 2014 |publisher=IGI Global |isbn=978-1-4666-6560-6 |chapter=3 Security Architecture for Cloud Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ackermann2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Tobias Ackermann |title=IT Security Risk Management: Perceived IT Security Risks in the Context of Cloud Computing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WFEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA136 |accessdate=21 February 2016 |date=22 December 2012 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-658-01115-4 |pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cloud Computing Sicherheit: Schutzziele, Taxonomie, Marktübersicht |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JgNUcgAACAAJ |accessdate=21 February 2016 |year=2009 |publisher=Fraunhofer-Institut for Sicker Informationstechnologie SIT |isbn=978-3-9813317-0-7 |chapter=Communications of the Association for Information Systems 13:Article 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4239">A '''corollary''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒr|ə|ˌ|l|ɛr|i}} {{respell|KORR|ə|lerr|ee}}, {{IPAc-en|uk|k|ɒ|ˈ|r|ɒ|l|ər|i}} {{respell|korr|OL|ər|ee}}) is a statement that [[logical consequence|follows readily]] from a previous statement.

==Overview==
In [[mathematics]], a corollary is a [[theorem]] connected by a short proof to an existing theorem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1176|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term ''corollary'', rather than ''[[proposition]]'' or ''theorem'', is intrinsically subjective. Proposition ''B'' is a corollary of proposition ''A'' if ''B'' can be readily deduced from ''A'' or is self-evident from its proof. The importance of the corollary is often considered secondary to that of the initial theorem; ''B'' is unlikely to be termed a corollary if its mathematical consequences are as significant as those of ''A''. Sometimes a corollary has a proof that explains the derivation; sometimes the derivation is considered self-evident.

==Peirce's theory of deductive reasoning&lt;!--'Peirce's theory of deductive reasoning' redirects here--&gt;==
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] held that the most important division of kinds of [[deductive reasoning]] is that between corollarial and theorematic. He argued that, while finally all deduction depends in one way or another on mental experimentation on schemata or diagrams,&lt;ref name=minute&gt;Peirce, C. S., from section dated 1902 by editors in the "Minute Logic" manuscript, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 4, paragraph 233, quoted in part in "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/corollarial.html Corollarial Reasoning]" in the ''Commons Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', 2003–present, Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; still in corollarial deduction "it is only necessary to imagine any case in which the premises are true in order to perceive immediately that the conclusion holds in that case",  whereas theorematic deduction "is deduction in which it is necessary to experiment in the imagination upon the image of the premise in order from the result of such experiment to make corollarial deductions to the truth of the conclusion."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., the 1902 Carnegie Application, published in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#NEM|The New Elements of Mathematics]]'', Carolyn Eisele, editor, also transcribed by [[Joseph Morton Ransdell|Joseph M. Ransdell]], see &lt;!-- NEXT TWO HYPHENS IN TEXT ARE NEEDED FOR BROWSER SEARCH AT LINKED SITE --&gt;"From Draft A – MS L75.35–39" in [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-06.htm#m19 Memoir 19] (once there, scroll down).&lt;/ref&gt; He held that corollarial deduction matches Aristotle's conception of direct demonstration, which Aristotle regarded as the only thoroughly satisfactory demonstration, while theorematic deduction (A) is the kind more prized by mathematicians, (B) is peculiar to mathematics,&lt;ref name=minute/&gt; and (C) involves in its course the introduction of a [[Lemma (mathematics)|lemma]] or at least a definition uncontemplated in the thesis (the proposition that is to be proved); in remarkable cases that definition is of an abstraction that "ought to be supported by a proper postulate."&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10167">In [[mathematics]]{{spaced ndash}}specifically, in the [[stochastic processes|theory of stochastic processes]]{{spaced ndash}}'''Doob's martingale convergence theorems''' are a collection of results on the long-time [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] of [[Martingale (probability theory)|supermartingale]]s, named after the American mathematician [[Joseph L. Doob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Doob, J. L.|title=Stochastic Processes|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of the theorems==
In the following, (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;''F''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;'''P'''), ''F''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' ≥ 0&lt;/sub&gt;, will be a [[filtered probability space]] and ''N''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' will be a right-[[continuous function|continuous]] supermartingale with respect to the filtration ''F''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;;  in other words, for all 0&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''s''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''t''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;+∞,

:&lt;math&gt;N_s \geq \operatorname{E} \big[ N_t \mid F_s \big].&lt;/math&gt;

===Doob's first martingale convergence theorem===

Doob's first martingale convergence theorem provides a sufficient condition for the [[random variable]]s ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt; to have a limit as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;+∞ in a pointwise sense, i.e. for each ''ω'' in the [[sample space]] Ω individually.

For ''t''&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0, let ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;max(&amp;minus;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;0) and suppose that

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{t &gt; 0} \operatorname{E} \big[ N_t^{-} \big] &lt; + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the pointwise limit

:&lt;math&gt;N(\omega) = \lim_{t \to + \infty} N_t (\omega)&lt;/math&gt;

exists and is finite for '''P'''-[[almost all]] ''ω''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;Ω.&lt;ref name=MITnotes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-070j-advanced-stochastic-processes-fall-2013/lecture-notes/MIT15_070JF13_Lec11Add.pdf|website=Massachusetts Institute of Tecnnology, 6.265/15.070J Lecture 11-Additional Material, Advanced Stochastic Processes, Fall 2013, 10/9/2013|title=Martingale Convergence Theorem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doob's second martingale convergence theorem===

It is important to note that the convergence in Doob's first martingale convergence theorem is pointwise, not uniform, and is unrelated to convergence in mean square, or indeed in any [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; space]]. In order to obtain convergence in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (i.e., [[convergence of random variables|convergence in mean]]), one requires uniform integrability of the random variables ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;. By [[Chebyshev's inequality]], convergence in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; implies convergence in probability and convergence in distribution.

The following are equivalent:

* (''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''t'' &gt; 0&lt;/sub&gt; is [[uniformly integrable]], i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{C \to \infty} \sup_{t &gt; 0} \int_{\{ \omega \in \Omega \, \mid \, N_t (\omega) &gt; C \}} \left| N_t (\omega) \right| \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{P} (\omega) = 0;&lt;/math&gt;

* there exists an [[Integral|integrable]] random variable ''N''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R''') such that ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''N'' as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;+∞ both '''P'''-[[almost surely]] and in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R'''), i.e.

::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \left[ \left| N_t - N \right| \right] = \int_\Omega \left| N_t (\omega) - N (\omega) \right| \, \mathrm{d} \mathbf{P} (\omega) \to 0 \text{ as } t \to + \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

===Corollary: convergence theorem for continuous martingales===
Let ''M''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞)&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a [[sample continuous process|continuous]] martingale such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{t &gt; 0} \operatorname{E} \big[ \big| M_t \big|^p \big] &lt; + \infty&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;1. Then there exists a random variable ''M''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R''') such that ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M'' as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;+∞ both '''P'''-almost surely and in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R''').

==Discrete-time results==
Similar results can be obtained for discrete-time supermartingales and submartingales, the obvious difference being that no continuity assumptions are required. For example, the result above becomes

Let ''M''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''N'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;Ω&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''R''' be a discrete-time martingale such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sup_{k \in \mathbf{N}} \operatorname{E} \big[ \big| M_k \big|^p \big] &lt; + \infty&lt;/math&gt;

for some ''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1. Then there exists a random variable ''M''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R''') such that ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''M'' as ''k''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;+∞ both '''P'''-almost surely and in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω,&amp;nbsp;'''P''';&amp;nbsp;'''R''')

=={{anchor|Convergence of conditional expectations: Lévy's zero-one law}}Convergence of conditional expectations: Lévy's zero–one law==
Doob's martingale convergence theorems imply that [[conditional expectation]]s also have a convergence property.

Let (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;'''P''') be a [[probability space]] and let ''X'' be a random variable in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Let ''F''&lt;sub&gt;∗&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''k''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; be any [[filtration (probability theory)|filtration]] of ''F'', and define ''F''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; to be the minimal [[sigma algebra|''&amp;sigma;''-algebra]] generated by (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''k''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \big[ X \mid F_k \big] \to \operatorname{E} \big[ X \mid F_\infty \big] \text{ as } k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

both '''P'''-almost surely and in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This result is usually called '''Lévy's zero–one law''' or '''Levy's upwards theorem'''. The reason for the name is that if ''A'' is an event in ''F''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;, then the theorem says that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}[ A \mid F_k ] \to \mathbf{1}_A &lt;/math&gt; almost surely, i.e., the limit of the probabilities is 0 or 1. In plain language, if we are learning gradually all the information that determines the outcome of an event, then we will become gradually certain what the outcome will be. This sounds almost like a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]], but the result is still non-trivial. For instance, it easily implies [[Kolmogorov's zero–one law]], since it says that for any [[tail event]] ''A'', we must have &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}[ A ] = \mathbf{1}_A &lt;/math&gt; almost surely, hence &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{P}[ A ] \in \{0,1\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Similarly we have the '''Levy's downwards theorem''' :

Let (Ω,&amp;nbsp;''F'',&amp;nbsp;'''P''') be a [[probability space]] and let ''X'' be a random variable in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Let (''F''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''k''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; be any decreasing sequence of sub-sigma algebras of ''F'', and define ''F''&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt; to be the intersection. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \big[ X \mid F_k \big] \to \operatorname{E} \big[ X \mid F_\infty \big] \text{ as } k \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;

both '''P'''-almost surely and in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Doob's upcrossing inequality==
The following result, called '''Doob's upcrossing inequality''' or, sometimes, '''Doob's upcrossing lemma''', is used in proving Doob's martingale convergence theorems.&lt;ref name=MITnotes/&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hypothesis.&lt;br&gt;Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be a natural number. Let &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n =1, \ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;, be a [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingale]] with respect to a [[Filtration (mathematics)|filtration]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n =1, \ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; be two real numbers with &lt;math&gt;a &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;Define the random variables &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;n = 1, \ldots, N&lt;/math&gt;, as follows: &lt;math&gt;U_n = m&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the largest integer such that there exist integers &lt;math&gt;j_1, k_1, j_2, k_2, \ldots, j_m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;k_m&lt;/math&gt; satisfying 1 ≤ &lt;math&gt;j_1&lt;/math&gt; &lt; &lt;math&gt;k_1 &lt; j_2 &lt; k_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; j_m &lt; k_m \leq n&lt;/math&gt; and, for &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \ldots, m&lt;/math&gt;, for each pair &lt;math&gt;j_i, k_i&lt;/math&gt; the inequalities &lt;math&gt;X_{j_i} &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X_{k_i} &gt; b&lt;/math&gt; are satisfied. Each &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the number of upcrossings with respect to the interval &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; for the martingale &lt;math&gt;X_i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i = 1, \ldots, n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Basic models: linear regression==
A basic tool for econometrics is the [[multiple linear regression]] model.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model" /&gt; In modern econometrics, other statistical tools are frequently used, but linear regression is still the most frequently used starting point for an analysis.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – multiple linear regression model"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greene, William|title=Econometric Analysis|date=2012|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780273753568|pages=47–48|edition=7th|chapter=Chapter 1: Econometrics | quote = Ultimately, all of these will require a common set of tools, including, for example, the multiple regression model, the use of moment conditions for estimation, instrumental variables (IV) and maximum likelihood estimation. With that in mind, the organization of this book is as follows: The first half of the text develops fundamental results that are common to all the applications. The concept of multiple regression and the linear regression model in particular constitutes the underlying platform of most modeling, even if the linear model itself is not ultimately used as the empirical specification.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimating a linear regression on two variables can be visualised as fitting a line through data points representing paired values of the independent and dependent variables.

[[File:Okuns law differences 1948 to mid 2011.png|thumb|right|Okun's law representing the relationship between GDP growth and the unemployment rate. The fitted line is found using regression analysis.]]

For example, consider [[Okun's law]], which relates GDP growth to the unemployment rate. This relationship is represented in a linear regression where the change in unemployment rate (&lt;math&gt;\Delta\ \text{Unemployment}&lt;/math&gt;) is a function of an intercept (&lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt;), a given value of GDP growth multiplied by a slope coefficient &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and an error term, &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\ \text {Unemployment} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\text{Growth} + \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

The unknown parameters &lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; can be estimated.  Here &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; is estimated to be −1.77 and &lt;math&gt; \beta_0 &lt;/math&gt; is estimated to be 0.83. This means that if GDP growth increased by one percentage point, the unemployment rate would be predicted to drop by 1.77 points.  The model could then be tested for [[statistical significance]] as to whether an increase in growth is associated with a decrease in the unemployment, as [[hypothesis test|hypothesized]]. If the estimate of &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; were not significantly different from 0, the test would fail to find evidence that changes in the growth rate and unemployment rate were related. The variance in a prediction of the dependent variable (unemployment) as a function of the independent variable (GDP growth) is given in [[polynomial least squares]].

==Theory==
{{see also|Estimation theory}}
Econometric theory uses [[statistical theory]] and [[mathematical statistics]] to evaluate and develop econometric methods.&lt;ref name="Greene Econometrics – mathematical statistics and statistical theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wooldridge Econometrics – mathematical statistics" /&gt; Econometricians try to find [[estimator]]s that have desirable statistical properties including [[Bias of an estimator|unbiasedness]], [[Efficiency (statistics)|efficiency]], and [[Consistent estimator|consistency]]. An estimator is unbiased if its expected value is the true value of the parameter; it is consistent if it converges to the true value as the sample size gets larger, and it is efficient if the estimator has lower standard error than other unbiased estimators for a given sample size. [[Ordinary least squares]] (OLS) is often used for estimation since it provides the BLUE or "best linear unbiased estimator" (where "best" means most efficient, unbiased estimator) given the [[Gauss-Markov (disambiguation)|Gauss-Markov]] assumptions. When these assumptions are violated or other statistical properties are desired, other estimation techniques such as [[maximum likelihood estimation]], [[generalized method of moments]], or [[generalized least squares]] are used. [[Bayes estimator|Estimators that incorporate prior beliefs]] are advocated by those who favour [[Bayesian statistics]] over traditional, classical or [[Frequentist probability|"frequentist" approaches]].

==Methods==
{{Main|Methodology of econometrics}}

''Applied econometrics'' uses theoretical econometrics and real-world [[economic data|data]] for assessing economic theories, developing [[econometric model]]s, analysing [[economic history]], and [[economic forecast|forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Clive Granger]] (2008). "forecasting,"
''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000161&amp;edition=current&amp;q=forecast&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518001935/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_F000161&amp;edition=current&amp;q=forecast&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 |date=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Econometrics may use standard [[statistical model]]s to study economic questions, but most often they are with [[observational study|observational]] data, rather than in [[experiment|controlled experiments]].&lt;ref name=Introductory_econometrics&gt;{{cite book |last=Wooldridge |first=Jeffrey |date=2013 |title=Introductory Econometrics, A modern approach |url= |location= |publisher=South-Western, Cengage learning |page= |isbn=978-1-111-53104-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this, the design of observational studies in econometrics is similar to the design of studies in other observational disciplines, such as astronomy, epidemiology, sociology and political science. Analysis of data from an observational study is guided by the study protocol, although [[exploratory data analysis]] may be useful for generating new hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Wold|Herman O. Wold]] (1969). "Econometrics as Pioneering in Nonexperimental Model Building," ''Econometrica'', 37(3), pp. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1912787 369]-381.&lt;/ref&gt; Economics often analyses systems of equations and inequalities, such as [[supply and demand]] hypothesized to be in [[equilibrium (economics)|equilibrium]]. Consequently, the field of econometrics has developed methods for [[parameter identification problem|identification]] and [[estimation theory|estimation]] of [[simultaneous equation methods (econometrics)|simultaneous-equation models]]. These methods are analogous to methods used in other areas of science, such as the field of [[system identification]] in [[systems analysis]] and [[control theory]].  Such methods may allow researchers to estimate models and investigate their empirical consequences, without directly manipulating the system.

One of the fundamental statistical methods used by econometricians is [[regression analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of a linear implementation of this framework, see [[linear regression]].&lt;/ref&gt; Regression methods are important in econometrics because economists typically cannot use [[Contrived experiment|controlled experiments]]. Econometricians often seek illuminating [[natural experiment]]s in the absence of evidence from controlled experiments. Observational data may be subject to [[omitted-variable bias]] and a list of other problems that must be addressed using causal analysis of simultaneous-equation models.&lt;ref&gt;Edward E. Leamer (2008). "specification problems in econometrics," ''The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics''. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923231333/http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_S000200&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Specification%20problems%20in%20econometrics&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 |date=23 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to natural experiments, [[Quasi-experiment|quasi-experimental methods]] have been used increasingly commonly by econometricians since the 1980s, in order to credibly identify causal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Angrist |first1=Joshua D |last2=Pischke |first2=Jörn-Steffen |title=The Credibility Revolution in Empirical Economics: How Better Research Design is Taking the Con out of Econometrics |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives |date=May 2010 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=3–30 |doi=10.1257/jep.24.2.3 |url=https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.24.2.3 |issn=0895-3309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
A simple example of a relationship in econometrics from the field of [[labour economics]] is:

:&lt;math&gt; \ln(\text{wage}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 (\text{years of education}) + \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

This example assumes that the [[natural logarithm]] of a person's wage is a linear function of the number of years of education that person has acquired. The parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; measures the increase in the natural log of the wage attributable to one more year of education. The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable representing all other factors that may have direct influence on wage. The econometric goal is to estimate the parameters, &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 \mbox{ and } \beta_1 &lt;/math&gt; under specific assumptions about the random variable &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with years of education, then the equation can be estimated with [[linear regression|ordinary least squares]].

If the researcher could randomly assign people to different levels of education, the data set thus generated would allow estimation of the effect of changes in years of education on wages. In reality, those experiments cannot be conducted. Instead, the econometrician observes the years of education of and the wages paid to people who differ along many dimensions. Given this kind of data, the estimated coefficient on Years of Education in the equation above reflects both the effect of education on wages and the effect of other variables on wages, if those other variables were correlated with education. For example, people born in certain places may have higher wages and higher levels of education. Unless the econometrician controls for place of birth in the above equation, the effect of birthplace on wages may be falsely attributed to the effect of education on wages.

The most obvious way to control for birthplace is to include a measure of the effect of birthplace in the equation above. Exclusion of birthplace, together with the assumption that &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is uncorrelated with education produces a misspecified model. Another technique is to include in the equation additional set of measured covariates which are not instrumental variables, yet render &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; identifiable.&lt;ref name=pearl00&gt;{{cite book |first=Judea |last=Pearl |year=2000 |title=Causality: Model, Reasoning, and Inference |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=0521773628 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An overview of econometric methods used to study this problem were provided by [[David Card|Card]] (1999).&lt;ref name=Card:00&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Card |year=1999 |chapter=The Causal Effect of Education on Earning |editor-last=Ashenfelter |editor-first=O. |editor2-last=Card |editor2-first=D. |title=Handbook of Labor Economics |location=Amsterdam |publisher=Elsevier |pages=1801–1863 |isbn=0444822895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Journals==
The main journals that publish work in econometrics are ''[[Econometrica]]'', the ''[[Journal of Econometrics]]'', the ''[[Review of Economics and Statistics]]'', ''[[Econometric Theory]]'', the ''[[Journal of Applied Econometrics]]'', ''[[Econometric Reviews]]'', the ''[[Econometrics Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/journal.asp?ref=1368-4221 |title=The Econometrics Journal – Wiley Online Library |publisher=Wiley.com |accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Applied Econometrics and International Development]]'', and the ''[[Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics]]''.

==Limitations and criticisms==
{{see also|Criticisms of econometrics}}

Like other forms of statistical analysis, badly specified econometric models may show a [[spurious relationship]] where two variables are correlated but causally unrelated. In a study of the use of econometrics in major economics journals, [[Deidre McCloskey|McCloskey]] concluded that some economists report [[p-value]]s (following the [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisherian]] tradition of [[tests of significance]] of point [[null hypothesis|null-hypotheses]]) and neglect concerns of [[type II error]]s; some economists fail to report estimates of the size of effects (apart from [[statistical significance]]) and to discuss their economic importance. She also argues that some economists also fail to use economic reasoning for [[model selection]], especially for deciding which variables to include in a regression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Loss Function has been mislaid: the Rhetoric of Significance Tests|last=McCloskey|journal=American Economic Review|date=May 1985|volume=75|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Ziliak|Stephen T. Ziliak]] and [[Deirdre McCloskey|Deirdre N. McCloskey]] (2004). "Size Matters: The Standard Error of Regressions in the ''American Economic Review''," ''Journal of Socio-economics'', 33(5), pp. [http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/Ziliak/doc/Size%20Matters%20Journal%20of%20Socio-Economics%20Ziliak%20and%20McCloskey.pdf 527-46] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625163446/http://faculty.roosevelt.edu/Ziliak/doc/Size%20Matters%20Journal%20of%20Socio-Economics%20Ziliak%20and%20McCloskey.pdf |date=25 June 2010 }} (press '''+''').&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, economic variables cannot be experimentally manipulated as treatments randomly assigned to subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leamer|first=Edward|title=Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics|journal=American Economic Review|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=1|page=34|jstor=1803924}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, economists rely on [[observational studies]], often using data sets with many strongly associated [[covariate]]s, resulting in enormous numbers of models with similar explanatory ability but different covariates and regression estimates. Regarding the plurality of models compatible with observational data-sets, [[Edward Leamer]] urged that "professionals ... properly withhold belief until an inference can be shown to be adequately insensitive to the choice of assumptions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leamer|first=Edward|title=Let's Take the Con out of Econometrics|journal=American Economic Review|date=March 1983|volume=73|issue=1|page=43|jstor=1803924}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Epistemic closure'''&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |author=Luper, Steven |title=The Epistemic Closure Principle |date=31 December 2001 |work=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |publisher= |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/closure-epistemic/#CloPri}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[property (philosophy)|property]] of some [[belief system]]s. It is the [[concept|principle]] that if a subject &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; [[Logical consequence|entails]] &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can thereby come to know &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. Most [[epistemology|epistemological]] [[philosophical theory|theories]] involve a closure principle and many [[Skepticism|skeptical]] [[argument]]s assume a closure principle.

On the other hand, some epistemologists, including [[Robert Nozick]], have denied closure principles on the basis of [[reliabilism|reliabilist]] accounts of knowledge. Nozick, in ''[[Philosophical Explanations]]'', advocated that, when considering the [[Gettier problem]], the least counter-intuitive assumption we give up should be epistemic closure. Nozick suggested a "truth tracking" theory of knowledge, in which the x was said to know P if x's belief in P tracked the truth of P through the relevant [[modal logic|modal scenarios]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical explanations'',  By Robert Nozick (Harvard 1981), page 204&lt;/ref&gt;

A subject may not actually believe &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;, for example, regardless of whether he or she is justified or warranted. Thus, one might instead say that knowledge is closed under ''known'' deduction: if, while knowing &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt; because &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows that &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; entails &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows &lt;var&gt;q&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; An even stronger formulation would be as such: If, while knowing various propositions, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; believes &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt; because &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows that these propositions entail &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;, then &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; knows &lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt; While the principle of epistemic closure is generally regarded as intuitive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Brady, Michael |author2=Pritchard, Duncan |title=Epistemological Contextualism: Problems and Prospects |journal=[[The Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=55 |issue=219 |pages=161–171 |year=2005 |doi=10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00393.x |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0031-8094.2005.00393.x/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophers such as [[Robert Nozick]] and [[Fred Dretske]] have argued against it.

== Epistemic closure and skeptical arguments ==
The epistemic closure principle typically takes the form of a [[modus ponens]] argument:

# S knows p.
# S knows that p entails q.
# Therefore, S knows q.

This epistemic closure principle is central to many versions of skeptical arguments.  A [[Skepticism|skeptical]] argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the [[brain in a vat]] scenario or the [[Evil demon|cartesian evil demon]] scenario.  A skeptic might say, for example, that if you know that you have hands, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge that you have hands implies that you know you are not handless, and if you know that you are not handless, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sosa|first=Ernest|date=1999-10-01|title=How to Defeat Opposition to Moore|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7/abstract|journal=Noûs|language=en|volume=33|pages=141–153|doi=10.1111/0029-4624.33.s13.7|issn=1468-0068}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The skeptic will then utilize this conditional to form a [[modus tollens]] argument.  For example, the skeptic might make an argument like the following:
# You do not know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (~K(~h))
# If you know that you have hands, then you know that you are not a handless brain in a vat (K(o) → K(~h))
# '''Conclusion:''' Therefore, you do not know that you have hands (~K(o))
Much of the epistemological discussion surrounding this type of skeptical argument involves whether to accept or deny the conclusion, and how to do each.  [[Ernest Sosa]] says that there are three possibilities in responding to the skeptic:
# Agree with the skeptic by granting him both premises and the conclusion (1, 2, c)
# Disagree with the skeptic by denying premise 2 and the conclusion, but maintaining premise 1 (1, ~2, ~c) as [[Robert Nozick|Nozick]] and [[Fred Dretske|Dretske]] do.  This amounts to ''denying'' the epistemic closure principle.
# Disagree with the skeptic by denying premise 1 and the conclusion, but maintaining premise 2 (~1, 2, ~c) as [[G. E. Moore|Moore]] does.  This amounts to ''maintaining'' the epistemic closure principle, and holding that knowledge is closed under known [[Logical consequence|implication]].

== Justificatory closure == 
In the seminal 1963 paper, “[[Gettier problem|Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?]]”, Edmund Gettier gave an assumption (later called the “principle of deducibility for justification” by [[Irving Thalberg, Jr.]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thalberg Jr., Irving |title=In Defense of Justified True Belief |journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=66 |issue=22 |pages=794–803 |date=November 1969 |jstor=2024370 |ref={{harvid|Thalberg|1969}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would serve as a basis for the rest of his piece: “for any proposition P, if S is justified in believing P and P entails Q, and S deduces Q from P and accepts Q as a result of this deduction, then S is justified in believing Q.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gettier, Edmund |title=Is Justified True Belief Knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–3 |date=June 1963 |jstor=3326922 |doi=10.1093/analys/23.6.121}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was seized upon by Thalberg, who rejected the principle in order to demonstrate that one of Gettier's examples fails to support Gettier's main thesis that justified true belief is not knowledge (in the following quotation, (1) refers to “Jones will get the job”, (2) refers to “Jones has ten coins”, and (3) is the [[logical conjunction]] of (1) and (2)):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why doesn't Gettier's principle (PDJ) hold in the evidential situation he has described? You multiply your risks of being wrong when you believe a conjunction. […&amp;nbsp;T]he most elementary theory of probability indicates that Smith's prospects of being right on both (1) and (2), namely, of being right on (3), are bound to be less favorable than his prospects of being right on either (1) or (2). In fact, Smith's chances of being right on (3) might not come up to the minimum standard of justification which (1) and (2) barely satisfy, and Smith would be unjustified in accepting (3). {{harv|Thalberg|1969|p=798}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Epistemic closure in U.S. political discussion ==
The term "epistemic closure" has been used in U.S. political debate to refer to the claim that political belief systems can be closed systems of deduction, unaffected by [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Epistemic Closure’? Those are Fighting Words |author=Patricia Cohen |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/books/28conserv.html?_r=0 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=27 April 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term was popularized by libertarian blogger and commentator [[Julian Sanchez (writer)|Julian Sanchez]] in 2010 as an extreme form of [[confirmation bias]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sanchez, Julian |title=Frum, Cocktail Parties, and the Threat of Doubt |date=26 March 2010 |url=http://www.juliansanchez.com/2010/03/26/frum-cocktail-parties-and-the-threat-of-doubt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3040">In [[algebraic topology]], a branch of [[mathematics]], the '''excision theorem''' is a theorem about [[relative homology]]&amp;mdash;given topological spaces ''X'' and subspaces ''A'' and ''U'' such that ''U'' is also a subspace of ''A'', the theorem says that under certain circumstances, we can cut out (excise) ''U'' from both spaces such that the relative homologies of the pairs (''X'',''A'') and (''X \ U'',''A \ U'') are isomorphic. This assists in computation of [[singular homology]] groups, as sometimes after excising an appropriately chosen subspace we obtain something easier to compute. Or, in many cases, it allows the use of induction. Coupled with the [[long exact sequence]] in homology, one can derive another useful tool for the computation of homology groups, the [[Mayer–Vietoris sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;See Hatcher 2002, p.149, for example&lt;/ref&gt;

More precisely, if ''X'', ''A'', and ''U'' are as above, we say that ''U'' can be '''excised''' if the inclusion map of the pair (''X \ U'',''A \ U '') into (''X'', ''A'') induces an isomorphism on the relative homologies ''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X \ U'',''A \ U '') to ''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X'',''A'') . The theorem states that if the [[Closure (topology)|closure]]  of ''U'' is contained in the [[Interior (topology)|interior]] of ''A'', then ''U'' can be excised. Often, subspaces which do not satisfy this containment criterion still can be excised&amp;mdash;it suffices to be able to find a [[deformation retract]] of the subspaces onto subspaces that do satisfy it.

The proof of the excision theorem is quite intuitive, though the details are rather involved. The idea is to subdivide the simplices in a relative cycle in (''X'',''A'') to get another chain consisting of "smaller" simplices, and continuing the process until each simplex in the chain lies entirely in the interior of ''A'' or the interior of ''X \ U''. Since these form an open cover for ''X'' and simplices are [[Compact space|compact]], we can eventually do this in a finite number of steps. This process leaves the original homology class of the chain unchanged (this says the subdivision operator is [[chain homotopy|chain homotopic]] to the identity map on homology). In the relative homology ''H&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(''X'',''A''), then, this says all the terms contained entirely in the interior of ''U'' can be dropped without affecting the homology class of the cycle. This allows us to show that the inclusion map is an isomorphism, as each relative cycle is  equivalent to one that avoids ''U'' entirely.

In the axiomatic approach to homology, the theorem is taken as one of the [[Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms]].

In [[additive number theory]], the '''Fermat polygonal number theorem''' states that every positive integer is a sum of at most {{mvar|n}} {{mvar|n}}[[-gonal number]]s. That is, every positive integer can be written as the sum of three or fewer [[triangular number]]s, and as the sum of four or fewer [[square number]]s, and as the sum of five or fewer [[pentagonal number]]s, and so on.

==Examples==
Three such representations of the number 17, for example, are shown below:
*17 = 10 + 6 + 1 (''triangular numbers'')
*17 = 16 + 1 (''square numbers'')
*17 = 12 + 5 (''pentagonal numbers'').

==History==
The theorem is named after [[Pierre de Fermat]], who stated it, in 1638, without proof, promising to write it in a separate work that never appeared.&lt;ref name="heath"&gt;{{harvtxt|Heath|1910}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] proved the [[Lagrange's four-square theorem|square case]] in 1770, which states that every positive number can be represented as a sum of four squares, for example, {{nowrap|1=7 = 4 + 1 + 1 + 1}}.&lt;ref name="heath"/&gt; [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] proved the triangular case in 1796,  commemorating the occasion by writing in [[Gauss's diary|his diary]] the line "[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ!]] {{nowrap|1=num = Δ + Δ + Δ}}",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bell|first=Eric Temple|authorlink=Eric Temple Bell|contribution=Gauss, the Prince of Mathematicians|editor-last=Newman|editor-first=James R.|title=The World of Mathematics|volume=I|pages=295–339|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=1956}}. Dover reprint, 2000, {{ISBN|0-486-41150-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and published a proof in his book [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]. For this reason, Gauss' result is sometimes known as the '''Eureka theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23200">In [[computer science]], specifically [[software engineering]] and [[hardware engineering]], '''formal methods''' are a particular kind of [[mathematically]] based technique for the [[formal specification|specification]], development and [[formal verification|verification]] of [[software]] and [[computer hardware|hardware]] systems.&lt;ref name="butler"&gt;{{cite web|author=R. W.

Formal methods are best described as the application of a fairly broad variety of [[theoretical computer science]] fundamentals, in particular [[logic in computer science|logic]] calculi, [[formal language]]s, [[automata theory]], [[discrete event dynamic system]] and [[program semantics]], but also [[type systems]] and [[algebraic data types]] to problems in software and hardware specification and verification.&lt;ref&gt;Monin, pp.3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==

Formal methods can be used at a number of levels:

'''Level 0:''' [[Formal specification]] may be undertaken and then a program developed from this informally. This has been dubbed ''formal methods lite''. This may be the most cost-effective option in many cases.

'''Level 1:''' [[Formal development]] and [[formal verification]] may be used to produce a program in a more formal manner. For example, proofs of properties or [[program refinement|refinement]] from the [[formal specification|specification]] to a program may be undertaken. This may be most appropriate in high-integrity systems involving [[safety]] or [[security]].

'''Level 2:''' [[Automated theorem prover|Theorem prover]]s may be used to undertake fully formal machine-checked proofs. This can be very expensive and is only practically worthwhile if the cost of mistakes is extremely high (e.g., in critical parts of microprocessor design).

Further information on this is expanded [[#Uses|below]].

As with [[Formal semantics of programming languages|programming language semantics]], styles of formal methods may be roughly classified as follows:

* [[Denotational semantics]], in which the meaning of a system is expressed in the mathematical theory of [[domain theory|domains]].  Proponents of such methods rely on the well-understood nature of domains to give meaning to the system; critics point out that not every system may be intuitively or naturally viewed as a function.
* [[Operational semantics]], in which the meaning of a system is expressed as a sequence of actions of a (presumably) simpler computational model.  Proponents of such methods point to the simplicity of their models as a means to expressive clarity; critics counter that the problem of semantics has just been delayed (who defines the semantics of the simpler model?).
* [[Axiomatic semantics]], in which the meaning of the system is expressed in terms of [[precondition]]s and [[postcondition]]s which are true before and after the system performs a task, respectively.  Proponents note the connection to classical [[logic]]; critics note that such semantics never really describe what a system ''does'' (merely what is true before and afterwards).

===Lightweight formal methods===

Some practitioners believe that the formal methods community has overemphasized full formalization of a specification or design.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Jackson (computer scientist)|Daniel Jackson]] and [[Jeannette Wing]], [http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/publications/ieee96-roundtable.html "Lightweight Formal Methods"], ''IEEE Computer'', April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vinu George and Rayford Vaughn, [http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/2003/01/George.html "Application of Lightweight Formal Methods in Requirement Engineering"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301022259/http://www.stsc.hill.af.mil/crosstalk/2003/01/George.html |date=2006-03-01 }}, ''Crosstalk: The Journal of Defense Software Engineering'', January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that the expressiveness of the languages involved, as well as the complexity of the systems being modelled, make full formalization a difficult and expensive task. As an alternative, various ''lightweight'' formal methods, which emphasize partial specification and focused application, have been proposed. Examples of this lightweight approach to formal methods include the [[Alloy language|Alloy]] object modelling notation,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Jackson, [http://people.csail.mit.edu/dnj/publications/alloy-journal.pdf "Alloy: A Lightweight Object Modelling Notation"], ''ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)'', Volume 11, Issue 2 (April 2002), pp. 256-290&lt;/ref&gt; Denney's synthesis of some aspects of the [[Z notation]] with [[use case]] driven development,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Denney, ''Succeeding with Use Cases: Working Smart to Deliver Quality'', Addison-Wesley Professional Publishing, 2005, {{ISBN|0-321-31643-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the CSK [[Vienna Development Method|VDM]] Tools.&lt;ref&gt;Sten Agerholm and Peter G. Larsen, [http://home0.inet.tele.dk/pgl/fmtrends98.pdf "A Lightweight Approach to Formal Methods"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060309041943/http://home0.inet.tele.dk/pgl/fmtrends98.pdf |date=2006-03-09 }}, In ''Proceedings of the International Workshop on Current Trends in Applied Formal Methods'', Boppard, Germany, Springer-Verlag, October 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Formal methods can be applied at various points through the [[software development process|development process]].

===Specification===
Formal methods may be used to give a description of the system to be developed, at whatever level(s) of detail desired.  This formal description can be used to guide further development activities (see following sections); additionally, it can be used to verify that the requirements for the system being developed have been completely and accurately specified.

The need for formal specification systems has been noted for years.  In the [[ALGOL 58]] report,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | first = J.W.  | last = Backus | title = The Syntax and Semantics of the Proposed International Algebraic Language of Zürich ACM-GAMM Conference | booktitle = Proceedings of the International Conference on Information Processing | publisher = UNESCO | year = 1959 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Backus]] presented a formal notation for describing programming language syntax, later named [[Backus normal form]] then renamed [[Backus–Naur form]] (BNF).&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Knuth|Knuth, Donald E.]] (1964), Backus Normal Form vs Backus Naur Form. ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'', 7(12):735–736.&lt;/ref&gt; Backus also wrote that a formal description of the meaning of syntactically valid ALGOL programs wasn't completed in time for inclusion in the report. "Therefore the formal treatment of the semantics of legal programs will be included in a subsequent paper." It never appeared.

===Development===
Once a formal specification has been produced, the specification may be used as a guide while the concrete system is [[Software development|developed]] during the [[Software design|design]] process (i.e., realized typically in software, but also potentially in hardware). For example:

* If the formal specification is in an operational semantics, the observed behavior of the concrete system can be compared with the behavior of the specification (which itself should be executable or simulateable). Additionally, the operational commands of the specification may be amenable to direct translation into executable code.
* If the formal specification is in an axiomatic semantics, the preconditions and postconditions of the specification may become [[assertion (computing)|assertion]]s in the executable code.

===Verification===

Once a formal specification has been developed, the specification may be used as the basis for [[mathematical proof|proving]] properties of the specification (and hopefully by inference the developed system).

====Human-directed proof====
Sometimes, the motivation for proving the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] of a system is not the obvious need for reassurance of the correctness of the system, but a desire to understand the system better.  Consequently, some proofs of correctness are produced in the style of [[mathematical proof]]: handwritten (or typeset) using [[natural language]], using a level of informality common to such proofs.  A "good" proof is one which is readable and understandable by other human readers.

Critics of such approaches point out that the [[ambiguity]] inherent in natural language allows errors to be undetected in such proofs; often, subtle errors can be present in the low-level details typically overlooked by such proofs.  Additionally, the work involved in producing such a good proof requires a high level of mathematical sophistication and expertise.

====Automated proof====
In contrast, there is increasing interest in producing proofs of correctness of such systems by automated means.  Automated techniques fall into three general categories:
* [[Automated theorem proving]], in which a system attempts to produce a formal proof from scratch, given a description of the system, a set of logical axioms, and a set of inference rules.
* [[Model checking]], in which a system verifies certain properties by means of an exhaustive search of all possible states that a system could enter during its execution.
* [[Abstract interpretation]], in which a system verifies an over-approximation of a behavioural property of the program, using a fixpoint computation over a (possibly complete) lattice representing it.

Some automated theorem provers require guidance as to which properties are "interesting" enough to pursue, while others work without human intervention. Model checkers can quickly get bogged down in checking millions of uninteresting states if not given a sufficiently abstract model.

Proponents of such systems argue that the results have greater mathematical certainty than human-produced proofs, since all the tedious details have been algorithmically verified.  The training required to use such systems is also less than that required to produce good mathematical proofs by hand, making the techniques accessible to a wider variety of practitioners.

Critics note that some of those systems are like [[Oracle machine|oracle]]s: they make a pronouncement of truth, yet give no explanation of that truth.  There is also the problem of "[[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?|verifying the verifier]]"; if the program which aids in the verification is itself unproven, there may be reason to doubt the soundness of the produced results. Some modern model checking tools produce a "proof log" detailing each step in their proof, making it possible to perform, given suitable tools, independent verification.

The main feature of the abstract interpretation approach is that it provides a sound analysis, i.e. no false negatives are returned. Moreover, it is efficiently scalable, by tuning the abstract domain representing the property to be analyzed, and by  applying widening operators&lt;ref&gt;A.Cortesi and M.Zanioli, [http://www.dsi.unive.it/~cortesi/paperi/CL_2011.pdf  Widening and Narrowing Operators for Abstract Interpretation]. Computer Languages, Systems and Structures. Volume 37(1), pp. 24–42, Elsevier, {{ISSN|1477-8424}} (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; to get fast convergence.

==Applications==
Formal methods are applied in different areas of hardware and software, including routers, Ethernet switches, routing protocols, and security applications. There are several examples in which they have been used to verify the functionality of the hardware and software used in DCs{{clarify|date=September 2015}}. IBM used [[ACL2]], a theorem prover, in AMD x86 processor development process{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. Intel uses such methods to verify its hardware and firmware (permanent software programmed into a read-only memory){{citation needed|date=September 2015}}. [[Dansk Datamatik Center]] used formal methods in the 1980s to develop a compiler system for the [[Ada programming language]] that went on to become a long-lived commercial product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Dines | last=Bjørner | first2=Christian | last2=Gram | first3=Ole N. | last3=Oest | first4=Leif | last4=Rystrøm | chapter=Dansk Datamatik Center | editor-first= John | editor-last=Impagliazzo | editor2-first=Per | editor2-last=Lundin | editor3-first=Benkt | editor3-last=Wangler | title=History of Nordic Computing 3: IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology | publisher=Springer | year= 2011 | pages= 350–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | contribution=40 Years of Formal Methods: Some Obstacles and Some Possibilities? | first=Dines | last=Bjørner | first2=Klaus | last2=Havelund | title=FM 2014: Formal Methods: 19th International Symposium, Singapore, May 12–16, 2014.

There are several other projects of NASA in which formal methods are applied, such as [[Next Generation Air Transportation System]]{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, Unmanned Aircraft System integration in National Airspace System,&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe, A. V., &amp; Ancel, E. (2008, November). Unmanned aerial systems integration to National Airspace System.

IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt; and Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution and Detection (ACCoRD).&lt;ref&gt;Airborne Coordinated Conflict Resolution and Detection, http://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/cam/ACCoRD/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[B-Method]] with [[AtelierB]],&lt;ref&gt;website : http://www.atelierb.eu/en/&lt;/ref&gt; is used to develop safety automatisms for the various subways installed throughout the world by [[Alstom]] and [[Siemens]], and also for Common Criteria certification and the development of system models by [[ATMEL]] and [[STMicroelectronics]].

Formal verification has been frequently used in hardware by most of the well-known hardware vendors, such as IBM, Intel, and AMD. There are many areas of hardware, where Intel have used FMs to verify the working of the products, such as parameterized verification of cache coherent protocol,&lt;ref&gt;C. T. Chou, P. K.

==In software development==

In [[software development]], formal methods are mathematical approaches to solving software (and hardware) problems at the requirements, specification, and design levels. Formal methods are most likely to be applied to safety-critical or security-critical software and systems, such as [[avionics software]].  Software safety assurance standards, such as [[DO-178B]], [[DO-178C]], and [[Common Criteria]] demand formal methods at the highest levels of categorization.

For sequential software, examples of formal methods include the [[B-Method]], the specification languages used in [[automated theorem proving]], [[Rigorous Approach to Industrial Software Engineering|RAISE]], and the [[Z notation]].

In [[functional programming]], [[QuickCheck|property-based testing]] has allowed the mathematical specification and testing (if not exhaustive testing) of the expected behaviour of individual functions.

The [[Object Constraint Language]] (and specializations such as [[Java Modeling Language]]) has allowed object-oriented systems to be formally specified, if not necessarily formally verified.

For concurrent software and systems, [[Petri net]]s, [[process algebra]], and [[finite state machine]]s (which are based on [[automata theory]] - see also [[virtual finite state machine]] or [[event driven finite state machine]]) allow executable software specification and can be used to build up and validate application behavior.

Another approach to formal methods in software development is to write a specification in some form of logic&amp;mdash;usually a variation of [[first-order logic]] (FOL)&amp;mdash;and then to directly execute the logic as though it were a program.  The [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] language, based on [[Description Logic]] (DL), is an example.  There is also work on mapping some version of English (or another natural language) automatically to and from logic, and executing the logic directly.  Examples are [[Attempto Controlled English]], and Internet Business Logic, which do not seek to control the vocabulary or syntax.  A feature of systems that support bidirectional English-logic mapping and direct execution of the logic is that they can be made to explain their results, in English, at the business or scientific level.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

In mathematics, '''Fáry's theorem''' states that any [[simple graph|simple]] [[planar graph]] can be [[Graph drawing|drawn]] without crossings so that its edges are straight [[line segment]]s. That is, the ability to draw graph edges as curves instead of as straight line segments does not allow a larger class of graphs to be drawn.  The theorem is named after [[István Fáry]], although it was proved independently by {{harvs|authorlink=Klaus Wagner (mathematician)|first=Klaus|last=Wagner|year=1936|txt}}, {{harvs|authorlink=István Fáry|last=Fáry|year=1948|txt}}, and {{harvs|first=S. K.|last=Stein|year=1951|txt}}.

== Proof ==
[[File:Fary-induction.svg|thumb|right|Induction step for proof of Fáry's theorem.]]
One way of proving Fáry's theorem is to use [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;The proof that follows can be found in {{citation|title=Graphs &amp; Digraphs|first1=Gary|last1=Chartrand|first2=Linda|last2=Lesniak|first3=Ping|last3=Zhang|author3-link=Ping Zhang (graph theorist)|edition=5th|publisher=CRC Press|year=2010|isbn=9781439826270|pages=259–260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6-FvXRlKsQC&amp;pg=PA259}}.&lt;!-- It's entirely possible that Chartrand et al got the proof from here, since their publication date is later than the date the proof was added here. But it's a valid mathematical proof, so there's no problem with circular reasoning. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Let  {{mvar|G}}  be a simple [[planar graph|plane graph]] with {{mvar|n}} vertices; we may add edges if necessary so that {{mvar|G}} is a maximally plane graph. If {{math|''n''}} &lt; 3, the result is trivial. If {{math|''n''}} ≥ 3, then all faces of  {{mvar|G}} must be triangles, as we could add an edge into any face with more sides while preserving planarity, contradicting the assumption of maximal planarity. Choose some three vertices {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} forming a triangular face of {{mvar|G}}. We prove by induction on {{mvar|n}} that there exists a straight-line combinatorially isomorphic re-embedding of {{mvar|G}} in which triangle {{math|''abc''}} is the outer face of the embedding.  (''Combinatorially isomorphic'' means that the vertices, edges, and faces in the new drawing can be made to correspond to those in the old drawing, such that all incidences between edges, vertices, and faces—not just between vertices and edges—are preserved.) As a base case, the result is trivial when {{math|1=''n'' = 3}} and {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}} are the only vertices in {{mvar|G}}. Otherwise, all vertices in {{mvar|G}} have at least three neighbors.

By [[planar graph|Euler's formula]] for planar graphs, {{mvar|G}} has {{math|3''n'' &amp;minus; 6}} edges; equivalently, if one defines the ''deficiency'' of a vertex {{mvar|v}} in {{mvar|G}} to be {{math|6 &amp;minus; [[Degree (graph theory)|deg]](''v'')}}, the sum of the deficiencies is {{math|12}}. Each vertex in {{mvar|G}} can have deficiency at most three, so there are at least four vertices with positive deficiency. In particular we can choose a vertex {{mvar|v}} with at most five neighbors that is different from {{mvar|a}}, {{mvar|b}} and {{mvar|c}}. Let {{math|''G'''}} be formed by removing {{mvar|v}} from {{mvar|G}} and retriangulating the face {{mvar|f}} formed by removing {{mvar|v}}.  By induction, {{mvar|G'}} has a combinatorially isomorphic straight line re-embedding in which {{mvar|abc}} is the outer face. Because the re-embedding of {{mvar|G}} was combinatorially isomorphic to {{mvar|G'}}, removing from it the edges which were added to create {{mvar|G'}} leaves the face {{mvar|f}}, which is now a polygon {{mvar|P}} with at most five sides.  To complete the drawing to a straight-line combinatorially isomorphic re-embedding of {{mvar|G}}, {{mvar|v}} should be placed in the polygon and joined by straight lines to the vertices of the polygon. By the [[Art gallery problem#Chvátal's art gallery theorem|art gallery theorem]], there exists a point interior to {{mvar|P}} at which {{mvar|v}} can be placed so that the edges from {{mvar|v}} to the vertices of {{mvar|P}} do not cross any other edges, completing the proof.

The induction step of this proof is illustrated at right.

De Fraysseix, Pach and Pollack showed how to find in linear time a straight-line drawing in a grid with dimensions linear in the size of the graph, giving a [[universal point set]] with quadratic size. A similar method has been followed by Schnyder to prove enhanced bounds and a [[Schnyder's theorem|characterization of planarity]] based on the incidence partial order. His work stressed the existence of a particular partition of the edges of a maximal planar graph into three trees known as a [[Schnyder wood]].

[[Tutte's spring theorem]] states that every 3-connected planar graph can be drawn on a plane without crossings so that its edges are straight line segments and an outside face is a convex polygon (Tutte 1963). It is so called because such an embedding can be found as the equilibrium position for a system of [[Spring (device)|springs]] representing the edges of the graph.

[[Steinitz's theorem]] states that every 3-connected planar graph can be represented as the edges of a convex polyhedron in three-dimensional space. A straight-line embedding of &lt;math&gt;G,&lt;/math&gt; of the type described by Tutte's theorem, may be formed by projecting such a polyhedral representation onto the plane.

The [[Circle packing theorem]] states that every planar graph may be represented as the [[intersection graph]] of a collection of non-crossing circles in the plane. Placing each vertex of the graph at the center of the corresponding circle leads to a straight line representation.

{{unsolved|mathematics|Does every planar graph have a straight line representation in which all edge lengths are integers?}}
[[Heiko Harborth]] raised the question of whether every planar graph has a straight line representation in which all edge lengths are integers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Harborth|Kemnitz|Moller|Sussenbach|1987}}; {{harvtxt|Kemnitz|Harborth|2001}}; {{harvtxt|Mohar|Thomassen|2001}}; {{harvtxt|Mohar|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The truth of [[Harborth's conjecture]] remains unknown {{As of|2014|lc=on}}. However, integer-distance straight line embeddings are known to exist for [[cubic graph]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Geelen|Guo|McKinnon|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{harvtxt|Sachs|1983}} raised the question of whether every graph with a [[linkless embedding]] in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] has a linkless embedding in which all edges are represented by straight line segments, analogously to Fáry's theorem for two-dimensional embeddings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31502">In [[mathematics]], the '''Grunsky matrices''', or '''Grunsky operators''', are matrices introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Grunsky|authorlink=Helmut Grunsky|year=1939}} in [[complex analysis]] and [[geometric function theory]]. They correspond to either a single [[holomorphic function]] on the [[unit disk]] or a pair of holomorphic functions on the unit disk and its complement. The '''Grunsky inequalities''' express boundedness properties of these matrices, which in general are [[Contraction (operator theory)|contraction operators]] or in important special cases [[unitary operator]]s. As Grunsky showed, these inequalities hold if and only if the holomorphic function is [[univalent function|univalent]]. The inequalities are equivalent to the inequalities of Goluzin, discovered in 1947.  Roughly speaking, the Grunsky inequalities give information on the coefficients of the logarithm of a univalent function; later generalizations by Milin, starting from the [[Lebedev–Milin inequality]], succeeded in exponentiating the inequalities to obtain inequalities for the coefficients of the univalent function itself. Historically the inequalities were used in proving special cases of the  [[Bieberbach conjecture]] up to the sixth coefficient; the exponentiated inequalities of Milin were used by [[Louis de Branges de Bourcia|de Branges]] in the final solution. The Grunsky operators and their [[Fredholm determinant]]s are related to spectral properties of bounded domains in the [[complex plane]]. The operators have further applications in [[conformal mapping]], [[Teichmüller theory]] and [[conformal field theory]].

If ''f''(''z'') is a holomorphic univalent function on the unit disk, normalized so that ''f''(0) = 0 and ''f'''(0) = 1, the function

:&lt;math&gt; g(z) = f(z^{-1})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

is a non-vanishing univalent function on |''z''| &gt; 1  having a simple pole at ∞ with residue 1:

:&lt;math&gt; g(z) = z + b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

The same inversion formula applied to ''g'' gives back ''f'' and establishes a one-one correspondence
between these two classes of function.

The '''Grunsky matrix''' (''c''&lt;sub&gt;''nm''&lt;/sub&gt;) of ''g'' is defined by the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\log\frac{g(z)-g(\zeta)}{z-\zeta} = -\sum_{m,n&gt;0}c_{nm}z^{-m}\zeta^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

It is a [[symmetric matrix]]. Its entries are called the '''Grunsky coefficients''' of ''g''.

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\log{g(z^{-1})-g(\zeta^{-1})\over z^{-1}-\zeta^{-1}} = \log{f(z)-f(\zeta)\over z -\zeta} -\log {f(z)\over z} -\log {f(\zeta)\over \zeta},&lt;/math&gt;

so that the coefficients can be expressed directly in terms of ''f''. Indeed, if

:&lt;math&gt;\log{f(z)-f(\zeta)\over z -\zeta} = -\sum_{m,n\ge 0} d_{mn} z^n \zeta^n,&lt;/math&gt;

then for ''m'', ''n'' &gt; 0

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{d_{mn} = c_{mn}}&lt;/math&gt;

and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;0''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''n''0&lt;/sub&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \log {f(z)\over z} = \sum_{n&gt;0} d_{0n} z^n&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{d_{00}=0.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Grunsky inequalities==
If ''f'' is a holomorphic function on the unit disk with Grunsky matrix (''c''&lt;sub&gt;''nm''&lt;/sub&gt;), the '''Grunsky inequalities''' state that

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\sum_{1\le m,n \le N} c_{mn}\lambda_m \lambda_n \right|\le \sum_{1\le n\le N} |\lambda_n|^2/n &lt;/math&gt;

for any finite sequence of complex numbers λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Faber polynomials==
The Grunsky coefficients of a normalized univalent function in |''z''| &gt; 1

:&lt;math&gt;g(z)=z+b_0 + b_1z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

are polynomials in the coefficients ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which can be computed recursively
in terms of the [[Faber polynomials]] Φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, a monic polynomial of degree ''n'' depending on ''g''.

Taking the derivative in ''z'' of the defining relation of the Grunsky coefficients and multiplying by ''z''
gives

:&lt;math&gt; {z g^\prime(z)\over g(z) -g(\zeta)} - {z\over z-\zeta} = \sum_{m,n&gt;0} m c_{mn} z^{-m} \zeta^{-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The Faber polynomials are defined by the relation

:&lt;math&gt; {z g^\prime(z)\over g(z) -w}=\sum_{n\ge 0} \Phi_n(w) z^{-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

Dividing this relation by ''z'' and integrating between ''z'' and ∞ gives

:&lt;math&gt; \log {g(z) - w\over z} =-\sum_{n\ge 1}{1\over n}\Phi_n(w) z^{-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the recurrence relations for ''n'' &gt; 0

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(w)= (w-b_0) \Phi_{n-1}(w) -nb_n -\sum_{0\le i \le n-1} b_{n-i} \Phi_{i}(w)&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_0(w)\equiv 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\ge 0} \Phi_n(g(z))\zeta^{-n} =1+\sum_{n\ge 1} \left(z^n +\sum_{m\ge 1} c_{nm}z^{-m}\right)\zeta^{-n},&lt;/math&gt;

so that for ''n'' ≥ 1

:&lt;math&gt;\Phi_n(g(z))=z^n + \sum_{m\ge 1} c_{nm}z^{-m}.&lt;/math&gt;

The latter property uniquely determines the Faber polynomial of ''g''.

==Milin's area theorem==
Let ''g''(''z'') be a univalent function on |''z''| &gt; 1 normalized so that

:&lt;math&gt; g(z) = z + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

and let ''f''(''z'') be a non-constant holomorphic function on '''C'''.

If

:&lt;math&gt; f(g(z))=\sum_{-\infty}^\infty c_n z^n&lt;/math&gt;

is the Laurent expansion on ''z'' &gt; 1, then

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n&gt;0}  n|c_n|^2 \le \sum_{n&gt;0} n|c_{-n}|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
If Ω is a bounded open region with smooth boundary ∂Ω and ''h'' is a differentiable function on Ω extending to a continuous function on the closure,
then, by [[Stokes' theorem]] applied to the [[differential 1-form]] ω = ''h(z)dz'',

:&lt;math&gt; \int_{\partial \Omega} h(z) \, dz = \int_{\partial \Omega} \omega = \iint_\Omega d\omega  = \iint_\Omega (i\partial_x-\partial_y)h \, dx \, dy= 2i \iint_\Omega \partial_{\overline{z}} h \,dx \, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

For ''r'' &gt; 1, let Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt; be the complement of the image of |''z''|&gt; ''r'' under ''g''(''z''), a bounded domain. Then, by the above identity with ''h'' = ''f''',  the area of
''f''(Ω&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;) is given by

:&lt;math&gt; A(r)=\iint_{\Omega_r} |f'(z)|^2\, dx \, dy = {1\over 2i}\int_{\partial\Omega_r} \overline{f(z)}f^\prime(z) \,dz={1\over 2i}\int_{|w|=r} \overline{f(g(w)))} f^\prime(g(w)) g^\prime(w)\, dw.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A(r)=\pi \sum_n n|c_{-n}|^2 r^{2n}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the area is non-negative

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n&gt;0} n|c_n|^2 r^{-2n} \le \sum_{n&gt;0} n |c_{-n}|^2 r^{2n}.&lt;/math&gt;

The result follows by letting ''r'' decrease to 1.

==Milin's proof of Grunsky inequalities==

If

:&lt;math&gt; p(w)=\sum_{n=1}^N n^{-1} \lambda_n \Phi_n(w),&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;p(g(z))=\left( \sum_{n=1}^N n^{-1}\lambda_n z^n\right) +\left(\sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^N \lambda_n c_{nm}z^{-m}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Applying Milin's area theorem,

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=1}^\infty m\left|\sum_{n=1}^N  c_{mn}\lambda_n\right|^2 \le \sum_{n=1}^N {1\over n}|\lambda_n|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

(Equality holds here if and only if the complement of the image of ''g'' has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.)

So ''a fortiori''

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=1}^N m\left|\sum_{n=1}^N  c_{mn}\lambda_n\right|^2 \le \sum_{n=1}^N {1\over n} |\lambda_n|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the symmetric matrix

:&lt;math&gt;a_{mn}=(mn)^{1/2} c_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;,

regarded as an operator on '''C'''&lt;sup&gt;''N''&lt;/sup&gt; with its standard inner product, satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\|Ax\|\le \|x\|.&lt;/math&gt;

So by the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]

:&lt;math&gt;|(Ax,y)|\le \|x\|\cdot\|y\|.&lt;/math&gt;

With &lt;math&gt; x_n=n^{-1/2}\lambda_n=\overline{y_n}&lt;/math&gt;, this gives the Grunsky inequality:

:&lt;math&gt; \left |\sum_{m=1}^N\sum_{n=1}^N  c_{mn} \lambda_m\lambda_n\right|^2 \le \sum_{n=1}^N {1\over n} |\lambda_n|^2,&lt;/math&gt;

==Criterion for univalence==
Let ''g''(''z'') be a holomorphic function on ''z'' &gt; 1 with

:&lt;math&gt; g(z) = z + b_0 + b_1 z^{-1} + b_2 z^{-2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

Then ''g'' is univalent if and only if the Grunsky coefficients of ''g'' satisfy the Grunsky inequalities for all ''N''.

In fact the conditions have already been shown to be necessary. To see sufficiency, note that

:&lt;math&gt; \log {g(z) -g(\zeta)\over z -\zeta}=-\sum_{m,n\ge 1}  c_{mn}z^{-m}\zeta^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

makes sense when |''z''| and |ζ| are large and hence the coefficients ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined. 
If the Grunsky inequalities are satisfied then it is easy to see that the |''c''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt;| are uniformly bounded
and hence the expansion on the left hand side converges for |''z''|&gt;1 and |ζ|&gt;1. Exponentiating both sides, this implies that ''g'' is univalent.

==Pairs of univalent functions==
Let ''F(z)'' and ''g''(ζ) be univalent holomorphic functions on |''z''| &lt; 1 and |ζ| &gt; 1, such that their images are disjoint in '''C'''. Suppose that these functions are normalized so that

:&lt;math&gt;g(\zeta)=\zeta+a_0 + b_1\zeta^{-1} + b_2\zeta^{-2} + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{F(z)=af(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''a'' ≠ 0 and

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = z + a_2z^2 + a_3z^3 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

The '''Grunsky matrix''' (''c''&lt;sub&gt;mn&lt;/sub&gt;) of this pair of functions is defined for all non-zero ''m'' and ''n'' by the formulas:

:&lt;math&gt; \log {g(\zeta)-g(\eta)\over \zeta -\eta} = -\sum_{m,n\ge 1} c_{mn} \zeta^{-m} \eta^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\log{g(\zeta) -  f(z)\over \zeta} -\log {g(\zeta)\over \zeta}= -\sum_{m,n\ge 1} c_{-m,n} z^m\zeta^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \log {f(z)-f(w)\over z -w} -\log{f(z)\over z} -\log{f(w)\over w} =-\sum_{m,n\ge 1} c_{-m,-n} z^m w^n&lt;/math&gt;

with ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''m'', –''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c''&lt;sub&gt;–''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''m'', ''n'' ≥ 1, so that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''mn''&lt;/sub&gt; is a symmetric matrix.

In 1972 the American mathematician James Hummel extended the Grunsky inequalities to this matrix, proving that for any sequence of complex numbers λ&lt;sub&gt;±1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., λ&lt;sub&gt;±''N''&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; |\sum_{n,m\ne 0} c_{mn}\lambda_m\lambda_n| \le \sum_{n\ne 0} {1\over |n|} |\lambda_n|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The proof proceeds by computing the area of the image of the complement of the images of |''z''| &lt; ''r'' &lt; 1 under ''F'' and |ζ| &gt; ''R'' &gt;1 under ''g''
under a suitable Laurent polynomial ''h''(''w'').

Let Φ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and Φ&lt;sub&gt;−''n''&lt;/sub&gt; denote the Faber polynomials of ''g'' and &lt;math&gt;f(z^{-1})^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and set

:&lt;math&gt; h(w) =\sum_{n\ge 1} {\lambda_n\over n} \Phi_n(w) + \sum_{n\ge 1} {\lambda_{-n}\over n} \Phi_{-n}({a\over w}).&lt;/math&gt;

Then for |''z''| &lt; 1

:&lt;math&gt; h(F(z))= \sum_{n\ge 1} {\lambda_{-n}\over n}z^{-n} +\alpha+ \sum_{n\ge 1} \alpha_n z^n,\,\,\, \alpha_n=\sum_m c_{-n,m}\lambda_m.&lt;/math&gt;

and for |ζ| &gt; 1

:&lt;math&gt; h(g(\zeta))=\sum_{n\ge 1} {\lambda_n\over n} \zeta^n+\beta +\sum_{n\ge 1} \beta_n \zeta^{-n},\,\,\,\beta_n=\sum_m c_{nm}\lambda_m.&lt;/math&gt;

The area equals

:&lt;math&gt; \int |h^\prime(z)|^2 \, dx \, dy= {1\over 2 i}\int_{C_1} \overline{h}(z) h^\prime(z)\, dz -{1\over 2 i}\int_{C_2} \overline{h}(z) h^\prime(z)\, dz,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the image of the circle |ζ| = ''R'' under ''g'' and  ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the image of the circle |''z''| = ''r'' under ''F''.

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;{1 \over \pi}\iint |h^\prime|^2 \, dx \, dy = \left[\sum_{n\ge 1} {1\over n} |\lambda_{-n}|^2 - \sum_{n\ge 1}  |\alpha_n|^2 r^{2n}\right] +\left[\sum_{n\ge 1}{1\over n}|\lambda_n|^2 - \sum_{n\ge 1}  |\beta_n|^2 R^{-2n}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Since the area is positive, the right hand side must also be positive. Letting ''r'' increase to 1 and ''R'' decrease to ''1'', it follows that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m\ne 0} |m| \left|\sum_{n\ne 0} c_{mn}\lambda_n\right|^2 \le \sum_{m\ne 0} {1\over |m|} |\lambda_m|^2&lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if the complement of the images has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero.

As in the case of a single function ''g'', this implies the required inequality.

==Unitarity==
The matrix

:&lt;math&gt; a_{mn}=\sqrt{|mn|} \cdot c_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;

of a single function ''g'' or a pair of functions ''F'', ''g'' is unitary if and only if the complement of the image of ''g'' or the union of the images of ''F'' and ''g'' has Lebesgue measure zero. So, roughly speaking, in the case of one function the image is a slit region in the complex plane; and in the case of two functions the two regions are separated by a closed Jordan curve.

In fact the infinite matrix ''A'' acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of square summable sequences satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{A^*A=I,}&lt;/math&gt;

But if ''J'' denotes complex conjugation of a sequence, then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ JAJ=A^*, \,\, JA^*J=A}&lt;/math&gt;

since ''A'' is symmetric. Hence

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{AA^*=JA^*AJ=I}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''A'' is unitary.

==Equivalent forms of Grunsky inequalities==

===Goluzin inequalities===
If ''g''(''z'') is a normalized univalent function in |''z''| &gt; 1, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct points with |''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; 1 and
α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., α&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; are complex numbers, the Goluzin inequalities, proved in 1947 by the Russian mathematician Gennadi Mikhailovich Goluzin (1906-1953), state that

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\sum_{m=1}^N \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_m\alpha_n \log{g(z_m) -g(z_n)\over z_m -z_n}\right|^2 \le \sum_{m=1}^N\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_m\overline{\alpha_n} \log{1\over 1-(z_m\overline{z_n})^{-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

To deduce them from the Grunsky inequalities, let

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\lambda_k=\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n z_n^{-k}.}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' &gt; 0.

Conversely the Grunsky inequalities follow from the Goluzin inequalities by taking

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\alpha_m={1\over N} \sum_{n=1}^N\lambda_n z_n^m.}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{z_n=re^{2\pi i n\over N}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''r'' &gt; 1, tending to ∞.

===Bergman–Schiffer inequalities===
{{harvtxt|Bergman|Schiffer|1951}} gave another derivation of the Grunsky inequalities using [[reproducing kernel]]s and singular integral operators   in [[geometric function theory]]; a more recent related approach can be found in {{harvtxt|Baranov|Hedenmalm|2008}}. Let ''f''(''z'') be a normalized univalent function in |''z''| &lt; 1, let ''z''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''z''&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; be distinct points with |''z''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; 1 and let
α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., α&lt;sub&gt;''N''&lt;/sub&gt; be complex numbers.

The Bergman-Schiffer inequalities state that

:&lt;math&gt; \left|\sum_{m=1}^N \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_m \alpha_n\left[ {f^\prime(z_m)f^\prime(z_n) \over(f(z_m)-f(z_n))^2} - {1\over (z_m-z_n)^{2}}\right]  \right| \le \sum_{m=1}^N \sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_m\overline{\alpha_n} {1\over (1-z_m\overline{z_n})^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

To deduce these inequalities from the Grunsky inequalities, set

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\lambda_k=k\sum_{n=1}^N \alpha_n z_n^k.}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' &gt; 0.

Conversely the Grunsky inequalities follow from the Bergman-Schiffer inequalities by taking

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\alpha_m={1\over N} \sum_{n=1}^N{1\over n} \lambda_n z_n^m.}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{z_n=re^{2\pi i n\over N}}&lt;/math&gt;

with ''r'' &lt; 1, tending to 0.

==Applications==
{{see also|Grunsky's theorem}}
The Grunsky inequalities imply many inequalities for univalent functions. They were also used by Schiffer and Charzynski in 1960 to give a completely elementary proof of the [[Bieberbach conjecture]] for the fourth coefficient; a far more complicated proof had previously been found by Schiffer and Garabedian in 1955. In 1968 Pedersen and Ozawa independently used the Grunsky inequalities to prove the conjecture for the sixth coefficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duren|1983|pp=131–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Koepf|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the proof of Schiffer and Charzynski, if

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=z+a_2 z^2 + a_3 z^3 + a_4z^4 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

is a normalized univalent function in |''z''| &lt; 1, then

:&lt;math&gt; g(z) =f(z^2)^{-1/2}=z + b_1 z^{-1} + b_3 z^{-3} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

is an odd univalent function in |''z''| &gt; 1.

Combining [[Gronwall's area theorem]] for ''f'' with the Grunsky inequalities for the first 2 x 2 minor of the Grunsky matrix of ''g'' leads to a bound for  |''a''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;| in terms of a simple function of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a free complex parameter. The free parameter can be chosen so that the bound becomes a function of half the modulus of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and it can then be checked directly that this function is no greater than 4 on the range [0,1].

As Milin showed, the Grunsky inequalities can be exponentiated. The simplest case proceeds by writing

:&lt;math&gt; \log {g(z)-g(\zeta)\over z-\zeta} = - \sum_{n\ge 1} a_n(\zeta^{-1})z^{-n}.&lt;/math&gt;

with ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''w'') holomorphic in |''w''| &lt; 1.

The Grunsky inequalities, with λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''w''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; imply that

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{\sum_{n\ge 1} n|a_n(w)|^2 \le - \log (1-|w|^2).}&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, if

:&lt;math&gt;  \displaystyle{\sum_{m\ge 0} b_m t^m = \exp \sum_{n\ge 1} a_n t^n }&lt;/math&gt;

as formal power series, then the first of the [[Lebedev–Milin inequalities]] (1965) states that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duren|1983|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Apart from the elementary proof of this result presented here, there are several other analytic proofs in the literature. {{harvtxt|Nikolski|2002|p=220}}, following [[Louis de Branges|de Branges]], notes that it is a consequence of standard inequalities connected with [[reproducing kernel]]s. {{harvtxt|Widom|1988}} observed that it was an immediate consequence of [[Fredholm determinant#Szegő limit formula|Szegő's limit formula]] (1951). Indeed if ''f'' is the real-valued trigonometric polynomial  on the circle given as twice the real part of a polynomial ''g''(''z'') vanishing at 0 on the unit disk, Szegő's limit formula states that the Toeplitz determinants of ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt; increase to ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''A''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''A'' is the area of ''g''(''D'').  The first determinant is by definition just the constant term in ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''f''&lt;/sup&gt; = |''e''&lt;sup&gt;''g''&lt;/sup&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;  \displaystyle{\sum_{n\ge 0} |b_n|^2 \le \exp \sum_{n\ge 1} n |a_n|^2. }&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently the inequality states that if ''g''(''z'') is a polynomial with ''g''(0) = 0, then

:&lt;math&gt;{1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} |e^g|^2 \, d\theta \le e^A,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''A'' is the area of ''g''(''D''),

To prove the inequality, note that the coefficients are determined by the recursive formula

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{b_n={1\over n}\sum_{m=1}^n ma_m b_{n-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

so that by the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]]

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{|b_n|^2 \le {1\over n} \sum m^2 |a_m|^2 |b_{n-m}|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantities ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; obtained by imposing equality here:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ c_n= {1\over n} \sum m^2 |a_m|^2 c_{n-m}}&lt;/math&gt;

satisfy &lt;math&gt; |b_n|^2 \le c_n&lt;/math&gt; and hence, reversing the steps,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sum |b_n|^2 \le  \sum c_n = \exp \sum_{m\ge 1} m|a_m|^2.}&lt;/math&gt;

In particular defining ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''w'') by the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\sum b_n(\zeta^{-1}) z^{-n} = \exp \sum a_m(\zeta^{-1}) z^{-m} = {g(z)-g(\zeta)\over z-\zeta},}&lt;/math&gt;

the following inequality must hold for |''w''| &lt; 1

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ \sum_{n\ge 0} |b_n(w)|^2 \le (1-|w|^2)^{-1}.}&lt;/math&gt;

==Beurling transform==
{{main article|Singular integral operators of convolution type}}
The '''Beurling transform''' (also called the '''Beurling-Ahlfors transform''' and the '''Hilbert transform in the complex plane''') provides one of the most direct methods of proving the Grunsky inequalities, following {{harvtxt|Bergman|Schiffer|1951}} and {{harvtxt|Baranov|Hedenmalm|2008}}.

The Beurling transform is defined on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''') as the operation of multiplication by &lt;math&gt;z/\overline{z}&lt;/math&gt; on [[Fourier transform]]s. It thus defines a unitary operator. It can also be defined directly as a [[principal value integral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahlfors|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; (Th)(w)=\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0} -{1\over \pi}\iint_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} {h(z)\over (z-w)^2} \,dx \, dy.&lt;/math&gt;

For any bounded open region Ω in '''C''' it defines a bounded operator ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Ω &lt;/sub&gt; from the conjugate of the [[Bergman space]] of Ω onto the Bergman space of Ω: a square integrable holomorphic function is extended to 0 off Ω to produce a function in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''C''') to which ''T'' is applied and the result restricted to Ω, where it is holomorphic. If ''f'' is a holomorphic univalent map from the unit disk ''D'' onto Ω then the Bergman space of Ω and its conjugate can be identified with that of ''D'' and  ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Ω &lt;/sub&gt; becomes the singular integral operator with kernel

:&lt;math&gt; K_f(z,w)={f^\prime(z)f^\prime(w)\over (f(z)-f(w))^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

It defines a [[contraction (operator theory)|contraction]]. On the other hand, it can be checked that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 by computing directly on powers &lt;math&gt;\overline{z}^n&lt;/math&gt; using Stokes theorem to transfer the integral to the boundary.

It follows that the operator with kernel

:&lt;math&gt;  {f^\prime(z)f^\prime(w)\over (f(z)-f(w))^2} \,-\,{1\over (z-w)^2}={\partial^2\over\partial z \partial w} \log {f(z) -f(w)\over z-w} =-\sum_{m,n\ge 1} mnc_{mn} z^{m-1}w^{n-1} &lt;/math&gt;

acts as a contraction on the conjugate of the Bergman space of ''D''. Hence, if

:&lt;math&gt; p(z)=\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 \overline{z} + \lambda_3 \overline{z}^2 + \cdots + \lambda_N \overline{z}^{N-1},&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{m=1}^N \left|\sum_{n=1}^N c_{mn}\lambda_n\right|^2=\|(T_f-T_z)p\|^2 =\|T_fp\|^2\le \|p\|^2= \sum_{n=1}^N {1\over n} |\lambda_n|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Grunsky operator and Fredholm eigenvalues==
If Ω is a bounded domain in '''C''' with smooth boundary, the operator ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt; can be regarded as a bounded antilinear [[contraction (operator theory)|contractive operator]] on the Bergman space ''H'' = ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω). It is given by the formula

:&lt;math&gt; (T_\Omega u)(z) = \lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0} {1\over \pi} \iint_{|z-w|\ge \varepsilon} {\overline{u(z)}\over (z-w)^2} \,\, dx \, dy&lt;/math&gt;

for ''u'' in the Hilbert space ''H''= ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω). ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt; is called the '''Grunsky operator''' of Ω (or ''f''). Its realization on ''D'' using a univalent function ''f'' mapping ''D'' onto Ω  and the fact that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''D''&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 shows that it is given by restriction of the kernel

:&lt;math&gt;{f^\prime(z)f^\prime(w)\over (f(z)-f(w))^2} -{1\over(z-w)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and is therefore a [[Hilbert–Schmidt operator]].

The antilinear operator ''T'' = ''T''&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the self-adjointness relation

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(Tu,v)=(Tv,u)}&lt;/math&gt;

for ''u'', ''v'' in ''H''.

Thus ''A'' = ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a compact self-adjont linear operator on ''H'' with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(Au,u)=(Tu,Tu)=\|Tu\|^2\ge 0,}&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''A'' is a positive operator. By the spectral theorem for compact self-adjoint operators, there is an orthonormal basis ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''H'' consisting of eigenvectors of ''A'':

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{Au_n=\mu_n u_n,}&lt;/math&gt;

where μ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is non-negative by the positivity of ''A''. Hence

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{\mu_n=\lambda_n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

with λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ≥ 0. Since ''T'' commutes with ''A'', it leaves its eigenspaces invariant. The positivity relation shows that it acts trivially on the zero eigenspace. The other non-zero eigenspaces are all finite-dimensional and mutually orthogonal. Thus an orthonormal basis can be chosen on each eigenspace so that:

:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle{Tu_n=\lambda_n u_n.}&lt;/math&gt;

(Note that &lt;math&gt; T(iu_n)=-\lambda_n iu_n&lt;/math&gt; by antilinearity of ''T''.)

The non-zero λ&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; (or sometimes their reciprocals) are called the '''Fredholm eigenvalues''' of  Ω:

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{ 0\le \lambda_n \le \|T\| \le 1.}&lt;/math&gt;

If  Ω is a bounded domain that is not a disk, Ahlfors showed that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\|T_\Omega\|&lt; 1.}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''[[Fredholm determinant]]''' for the domain Ω is defined by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiffer|1959|p=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiffer|Hawley|1962|p=246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta_\Omega=\det (I- T_\Omega^2) =\prod (1-\lambda_n^2).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this makes sense because ''A'' = ''T''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[trace class operator]].

{{harvtxt|Schiffer|Hawley|1962}} showed that. if 0 lies in Ω and ''f'' fixes 0, then&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schiffer|Hawley|1962|pp=245–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Takhtajan|Teo|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta_\Omega= -{1\over 12\pi}\left[\|\partial_z \log f^\prime\|^2_D +\|\partial_z \log g^\prime\|^2_{D^c}  - 2 \|\partial_z\log f(z)/z \|^2_D  - 2 \|\partial_z\log g(z)/z \|^2_{D^c}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Here the norms are in the Bergman spaces of  ''D'' and its complement  ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''g'' is a univalent map from ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; onto Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt; fixing ∞.

A similar formula applies in the case of a pair of univalent functions (see below).

==Singular integral operators on a closed curve==
Let Ω be a bounded simply connected domain in '''C''' with smooth boundary ''C'' = ∂Ω. Thus there is a univalent holomorphic map ''f'' from the unit disk ''D'' onto Ω extending to a smooth map between the boundaries ''S''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and ''C''.

==Definition==
If ''G'' is an undirected graph, and ''X'' is a set of vertices, then an ''X''-flap is a nonempty [[connected component (graph theory)|connected component]] of the subgraph of ''G'' formed by deleting ''X''. A '''haven''' of order ''k'' in ''G'' is a function ''&amp;beta;'' that assigns an ''X''-flap ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') to every set ''X'' of fewer than ''k'' vertices. This function must also satisfy additional constraints which are given differently by different authors.
The number ''k'' is called the ''order'' of the haven.&lt;ref name="JRST"&gt;{{ citation

In the definition used later by Alon, Seymour, and Thomas,&lt;ref name="ast90"/&gt; havens are instead required to satisfy a weaker [[monotonicity]] property: if {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ ''Y''}}, and both ''X'' and ''Y'' have fewer than ''k'' vertices, then {{nowrap|''&amp;beta;''(''Y'') ⊆ ''&amp;beta;''(''X'')}}. The touching property implies the monotonicity property, but not necessarily vice versa. However, it follows from the results of Seymour and Thomas&lt;ref name="st93"/&gt; that, in finite graphs, if a haven with the monotonicity property exists, then one with the same order and the touching property also exists.

[[File:3x3 grid graph haven.svg|thumb|A bramble of order four. A haven derived from this bramble maps every set ''X'' of three or fewer vertices to the unique connected component of ''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''X'' that includes at least one subgraph from the bramble.]]
Havens with the touching definition are closely related to [[bramble (graph theory)|brambles]], families of connected subgraphs of a given graph that all touch each other. The order of a bramble is the minimum number of vertices needed in a set of vertices that hits all of the subgraphs in the family. The set of flaps ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') for a haven of order ''k'' (with the touching definition) forms a bramble of order at least ''k'', because any set ''Y'' of fewer than ''k'' vertices fails to hit the subgraph ''&amp;beta;''(''Y''). Conversely, from any bramble of order ''k'', one may construct a haven of the same order, by defining ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') (for each choice of ''X'') to be the ''X''-flap that includes all of the subgraphs in the bramble that are disjoint from&amp;nbsp;''X''. The requirement that the subgraphs in the bramble all touch each other can be used to show that this ''X''-flap exists, and that all of the flaps ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') chosen in this way touch each other. Thus, a graph has a bramble of order ''k'' if and only if it has a haven of order&amp;nbsp;''k''.

==Example==
As an example, let ''G'' be a nine-vertex [[grid graph]]. Define a haven of order 4 in ''G'', mapping each set ''X'' of three or fewer vertices to an ''X''-flap ''&amp;beta;''(''X''), as follows:
*If there is a unique ''X''-flap that is larger than any of the other ''X''-flaps, let ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') be that unique large ''X''-flap.
*Otherwise, choose ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') arbitrarily to be any ''X''-flap.
It is straightforward to verify by a [[Proof by cases|case analysis]] that this function ''&amp;beta;'' satisfies the required monotonicity property of a haven. If {{nowrap|''X'' ⊆ ''Y''}} and ''X'' has fewer than two vertices, or ''X'' has two vertices that are not the two neighbors of a corner vertex of the grid, then there is only one ''X''-flap and it contains every ''Y''-flap. In the remaining case, ''X'' consists of the two neighbors of a corner vertex and has two ''X''-flaps: one consisting of that corner vertex, and another (chosen as ''&amp;beta;''(''X'')) consisting of the six remaining vertices. No matter which vertex is added to ''X'' to form ''Y'', there will be a ''Y''-flap with at least four vertices, which must be the unique largest flap since it contains more than half of the vertices not in ''Y''. This large ''Y''-flap will be chosen as ''&amp;beta;''(''Y'') and will be a subset of ''&amp;beta;''(''X''). Thus in each case monotonicity holds.

==Pursuit-evasion==
Havens model a certain class of strategies for an evader in a [[pursuit-evasion]] game in which fewer than ''k'' pursuers attempt to capture a single evader, the pursuers and evader are both restricted to the vertices of a given undirected graph, and the positions of the pursuers and evader are known to both players. At each move of the game, a new pursuer may be added to an arbitrary vertex of the graph (as long as fewer than ''k'' pursuers are placed on the graph at any time) or one of the already-added pursuers may be removed from the graph. However, before a new pursuer is added, the evader is first informed of its new location and may move along the edges of the graph to any unoccupied vertex. While moving, the evader may not pass through any vertex that is already occupied by any of the pursuers.

If a ''k''-haven (with the monotonicity property) exists, then the evader may avoid being captured indefinitely, and win the game, by always moving to a vertex of ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') where ''X'' is the set of vertices that will be occupied by pursuers at the end of the move. The monotonicity property of a haven guarantees that, when a new pursuer is added to a vertex of the graph, the vertices in ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') are always reachable from the current position of the evader.&lt;ref name="st93"/&gt;

For instance, an evader can win this game against three pursuers on a {{nowrap|3 &amp;times; 3}} grid by following this strategy with the haven of order&amp;nbsp;4 described in the example. However, on the same graph, four pursuers can always capture the evader, by first moving onto three vertices that split the grid onto two three-vertex paths, then moving into the center of the path containing the evader, forcing the evader into one of the corner vertices, and finally removing one of the pursuers that is not adjacent to this corner and placing it onto the evader. Therefore, the {{nowrap|3 &amp;times; 3}} grid can have no haven of order&amp;nbsp;5.

Havens with the touching property allow the evader to win the game against more powerful pursuers that may simultaneously jump from one set of occupied vertices to another.&lt;ref name="st93"/&gt;

==Connections to treewidth, separators, and minors==
Havens may be used to characterize the [[treewidth]] of graphs: a graph has a haven of order ''k'' if and only if it has treewidth at least {{nowrap|''k'' &amp;minus; 1}}. A tree decomposition may be used to describe a winning strategy for the pursuers in the same pursuit-evasion game, so it is also true that a graph has a haven of order ''k'' if and only if the evader wins with best play against fewer than ''k'' pursuers. In games won by the evader, there is always an optimal strategy in the form described by a haven, and in games won by the pursuer, there is always an optimal strategy in the form described by a tree decomposition.&lt;ref name="st93"/&gt; For instance, because the {{nowrap|3 &amp;times; 3}} grid has a haven of order&amp;nbsp;4, but does not have a haven of order&amp;nbsp;5, it must have treewidth exactly&amp;nbsp;3. The same min-max theorem can be generalized to [[infinite graph]]s of finite treewidth, with a definition of treewidth in which the underlying tree is required to be rayless (that is, having no [[end (graph theory)|ends]]).&lt;ref name="st93"/&gt;

Havens are also closely related to the existence of [[planar separator theorem|separator]]s, small sets ''X'' of vertices in an ''n''-vertex graph such that every ''X''-flap has at most 2''n''/3 vertices. If a graph ''G'' does not have a ''k''-vertex separator, then every set ''X'' of at most ''k'' vertices has a (unique) ''X''-flap with more than 2''n''/3 vertices. In this case, ''G'' has a haven of order {{nowrap|''k'' + 1}}, in which ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') is defined to be this unique large ''X''-flap. That is, every graph has either a small separator or a haven of high order.&lt;ref name="ast90"&gt;{{citation

If a graph ''G'' has a haven of order ''k'', with {{nowrap|''k'' ≥ ''h''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;}} for some integer ''h'', then ''G'' must also have a [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt; as a [[Minor (graph theory)|minor]]. In other words, the [[Hadwiger number]] of an ''n''-vertex graph with a haven of order ''k'' is at least ''k''&lt;sup&gt;2/3&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1/3&lt;/sup&gt;. As a consequence, the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;-minor-free graphs have treewidth less than ''h''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; and separators of size less than ''h''&lt;sup&gt;3/2&lt;/sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;. More generally an O({{radic|''n''}}) bound on treewidth and separator size holds for any nontrivial family of graphs that can be characterized by [[forbidden minor]]s, because for any such family there is a constant ''h'' such that the family does not include ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''h''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="ast90"/&gt;

==In infinite graphs==
If a graph ''G'' contains a ray, a semi-infinite simple path with a starting vertex but no ending vertex, then it has a haven of order [[Aleph number|ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]]: that is, a function ''&amp;beta;'' that maps each finite set ''X'' of vertices to an ''X''-flap, satisfying the consistency condition for havens. Namely, define ''&amp;beta;''(''X'') to be the unique ''X''-flap that contains infinitely many vertices of the ray. Thus, in the case of infinite graphs the connection between treewidth and havens breaks down: a single ray, despite itself being a tree, has havens of all finite orders and even more strongly a haven of order ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Two rays of an infinite graph are considered to be equivalent if there is no finite set of vertices that [[vertex separator|separates]] infinitely many vertices of one ray from infinitely many vertices of the other ray; this is an [[equivalence relation]], and its [[equivalence class]]es are called [[End (graph theory)|ends]] of the graph.

The ends of any graph are in one-to-one correspondence with its havens of order ℵ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. For, every ray determines a haven, and every two equivalent rays determine the same haven.&lt;ref name="rst91"/&gt; Conversely, every haven is determined by a ray in this way, as can be shown by the following case analysis:
*If the haven has the property that the intersection &lt;math&gt;S=\bigcap_X\left(\beta(X)\cup X\right)&lt;/math&gt; ( where the intersection ranges over all finite sets ''X'') is itself an infinite set ''S'', then every finite simple path that ends in a vertex of ''S'' can be extended to reach an additional vertex of ''S'', and repeating this extension process produces a ray passing through infinitely many vertices of ''S''. This ray determines the given haven.
*On the other hand, if ''S'' is finite, then (by working in the subgraph ''G''&amp;nbsp;\&amp;nbsp;''S'') it can be assumed to be empty. In this case, for each finite set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of vertices there is a finite set ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt; with the property that ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is disjoint from &lt;math&gt;X_{i+1}\cup\beta(X_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt;. If a robber follows the evasion strategy determined by the haven, and the police follow a strategy given by this sequence of sets, then the path followed by the robber forms a ray that determines the haven.&lt;ref name="dk03"/&gt;
Thus, every equivalence class of rays defines a unique haven, and every haven is defined by an equivalence class of rays.

For any [[cardinal number]] &lt;math&gt;\kappa\ge\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;, an infinite graph ''G'' has a haven of order &amp;kappa; if and only if it has a [[clique (graph theory)|clique]] [[minor (graph theory)|minor]] of order &amp;kappa;. That is, for uncountable cardinalities, the largest order of a haven in ''G'' is the [[Hadwiger number]] of ''G''.&lt;ref name="rst91"/&gt;

A '''heartbeat message''' in signal processing is a message sent from an originator to a destination that enables the destination to identify if and when the originator fails or is no longer available.&lt;ref name="att01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gVQ3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 4,710,926 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |author=Brown|date=1987-12-01|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a [[periodic_function|periodic]] or recurring basis from the originator's start-up until the originator's shutdown. When the destination identifies a lack of heartbeat messages during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that the originator has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available.  Heartbeat messages may be used for [[high-availability]] and [[fault tolerance]] purposes.

'''Hyper-encryption''' is a form of [[encryption]] invented by [[Michael O. Rabin]] which uses a high-bandwidth source of public [[random]] [[bit]]s, together with a [[secret key]] that is shared by only the sender and recipient(s) of the message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rabin|first1=M.O.|title=Provably unbreakable hyper-encryption in the limited access model|journal=IEEE Information Theory Workshop on Theory and Practice in Information-Theoretic Security, 2005|date=2005-10-19|pages=34–37|doi=10.1109/ITWTPI.2005.1543953|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/40a1/a4beec910bd48add69b9e8cb803a97544828.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the assumptions of [[Ueli Maurer (cryptographer)|Ueli Maurer]]'s [[bounded-storage model]] as the basis of its secrecy. Although everyone can see the data, decryption by adversaries without the secret key is still not feasible, because of the space limitations of storing enough data to mount an attack against the system.

Unlike almost all other cryptosystems except the [[one-time pad]], hyper-encryption can be proved to be [[information-theoretically secure]], provided the storage bound cannot be surpassed. Moreover, if the necessary public information cannot be stored at the time of transmission, the plaintext can be shown to be impossible to recover, regardless of the computational capacity available to an adversary in the future, even if they have access to the secret key at that future time.

A highly energy-efficient implementation of a hyper-encryption chip was demonstrated by [[Krishna Palem]] et al. using the Probabilistic CMOS or [[PCMOS]] technology and was shown to be  ~205 times more efficient in terms of Energy-Performance-Product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rice.edu/nationalmedia/news2009-02-08-pcmos.shtml|title=Revolutionary microchip uses 30 times less power|publisher=Rice University|access-date=2012-07-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218194953/http://www.rice.edu/nationalmedia/news2009-02-08-pcmos.shtml|archive-date=2012-02-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cs.rice.edu/~kvp1/pubs/crest-tech-05-08-02.pdf|title= Ultra Efficient Embedded SOC Architectures based on Probabilistic CMOS (PCMOS) Technology|author1=Lakshmi N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3851">In [[mathematics]], '''integral geometry''' is the theory of [[measure (mathematics)|measures]] on a geometrical space invariant under the [[symmetry group]] of that space.  In more recent times, the meaning has been broadened to include a view of invariant (or [[equivariant]]) transformations from the space of functions on one geometrical space to the space of functions on another geometrical space.  Such transformations often take the form of [[integral transform]]s such as the [[Radon transform]] and its generalizations.

== Classical context ==
Integral geometry as such first emerged as an attempt to refine certain statements of geometric probability theory.  The early work of [[Luis Santaló]]&lt;ref&gt;Luis Santaló (1953) ''Introduction to Integral Geometry'', Hermann (Paris)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilhelm Blaschke]]&lt;ref&gt;Wilhelm Blaschke (1955) ''Vorlesungen über Integralgeometrie'',  [[VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften]]&lt;/ref&gt; was in this connection. It follows from the [[Crofton formula|classic theorem of Crofton]] expressing the [[length]] of a plane [[curve]] as an [[expected value|expectation]] of the number of intersections with a [[random]] line.  Here the word 'random' must be interpreted as subject to correct symmetry considerations.

There is a sample space of lines, one on which the [[affine group]] of the plane acts. A [[probability measure]] is sought on this space, invariant under the symmetry group. If, as in this case, we can find a unique such invariant measure, that solves the problem of formulating accurately what 'random line' means; and expectations become integrals with respect to that measure. (Note for example that the phrase 'random chord of a circle' can be used to construct some [[paradox]]es--for example [[Bertrand paradox (probability)|Bertrand's paradox]].)

We can therefore say that integral geometry in this sense is the application of [[probability theory]] (as axiomatized by [[Kolmogorov]]) in the context of the [[Erlangen programme]] of [[Felix Klein|Klein]]. The content of the theory is effectively that of invariant (smooth) measures on (preferably [[Compact space|compact]]) [[homogeneous space]]s of [[Lie group]]s; and the evaluation of integrals of the [[differential form]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Santaló (1976) ''Integral Geometry and Geometric Probability'', [[Addison Wesley]]] {{ISBN|0201135000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A very celebrated case is the problem of [[Buffon's needle]]: drop a needle on a floor made of planks and calculate the probability the needle lies across a crack. Generalising, this theory is applied to various [[stochastic process]]es concerned with geometric and incidence questions.  See [[stochastic geometry]].

One of the most interesting theorems in this form of integral geometry is [[Hadwiger's theorem]].

The more recent meaning of '''integral geometry''' is that of [[Sigurdur Helgason (mathematician)|Sigurdur Helgason]]&lt;ref&gt;Sigurdur Helgason (2000) ''Groups and Geometric Analysis: integral geometry, invariant differential operators, and spherical functions'', [[American Mathematical Society]] {{ISBN|0821826735}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigurdur Helgason (2011) ''Integral Geometry and Radon Transforms'', Springer, {{ISBN|9781441960542}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel Gelfand]].&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Gel’fand (2003) ''Selected Topics in Integral Geometry'', American Mathematical Society {{ISBN|0821829327}}&lt;/ref&gt; It deals more specifically with integral transforms, modeled on the [[Radon transform]]. Here the underlying geometrical incidence relation (points lying on lines, in Crofton's case) is seen in a freer light, as the site for an integral transform composed as ''pullback onto the incidence graph'' and then ''push forward''.

'''Jean-Benoît Bost''' (born 27 July 1961 in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]) is a French mathematician.

==Education and career==
In 1977 Bost graduated from the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] and finished first in the [[Concours général]], the national competition for the places at the elite schools. Bost studied from 1979 to 1983 (qualifying in 1981 for the ''agrégation des mathématiques'') at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] (ENS), where he was from 1984 to 1988 ''[[Agrégation|agrégé]]-préparateur'' (teacher) and worked under the direction of [[Alain Connes]]. From 1988 he was ''chargé de recherches'' and from 1993 ''directeur de recherches'' at [[National Center for Scientific Research|CNRS]]. From 1993 to 2006 he was ''maître de conferences'' at the [[École polytechnique]]. He has been a professor at l'[[Université Paris-Sud]] (Paris XI) in [[Orsay]] since 1998.

Bost deals with noncommutative geometry (partly in collaboration with [[Alain Connes]]) with applications to quantum field theory, algebraic geometry, and arithmetic geometry. The eponymous Bost conjecture is a generalization of the [[Baum–Connes conjecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|author=Bartels, Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Bartels|author2=Echterhoff, Siegfried|author3=Lück, Wolfgang|authorlink3=Wolfgang Lück|title=Inheritance of Isomorphism Conjectures under colimits|year=2007|eprint=math/0702460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 he received the Prix Peccot-Vimont of the [[Collège de France]]. In 2002 he received the [[Elie Cartan Prize|Prix Élie Cartan]] of the [[Académie des sciences]]. In 1986 he was an invited speaker at the [[International Congress on Mathematical Physics]] in [[Marseille]]. In 2006 he was an invited speaker with talk ''Evaluation maps, slopes, and algebraicity criteria'' at the [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bost, Jean-Benoît|title=''In:'' Proceedings of the International Congress of Mathematicians, Madrid, 2006|chapter=Evaluation maps, slopes, and algebraicity conjectures|volume=vol. 2|pages=537–562|publisher=European Mathematical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2005 to 2015 Bost was a senior member of the [[Institut Universitaire de France]]. He was elected in 2012 a Fellow of the [[American Mathematical Society]] and in 2016 a member of [[Academia Europaea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jean-Benoît Bost|website=Academia Europaea|url=http://www.ae-info.org/ae/Member/Bost_Jean-Benoît}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Connections to other polynomials */ but mentioning the word "adjacency matrix" is helpful, isn't it?  (graphs have many matrices associated to them, so "its characteristic polynomial" is not unambiguous)</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6906">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] fields of [[graph theory]] and [[combinatorics]], a '''matching polynomial''' (sometimes called an '''acyclic polynomial''') is a [[generating function]] of the numbers of [[Matching (graph theory)|matching]]s of various sizes in a graph. It is one of several [[graph polynomial]]s studied in [[algebraic graph theory]].

==Definition==
Several different types of matching polynomials have been defined. Let ''G'' be a graph with ''n'' vertices and let ''m&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' be the number of ''k''-edge matchings.

One matching polynomial of ''G'' is
:&lt;math&gt;m_G(x) := \sum_{k\geq0} m_k x^k.&lt;/math&gt;

Another definition gives the matching polynomial as
:&lt;math&gt;M_G(x) := \sum_{k\geq0} (-1)^k m_k x^{n-2k}.&lt;/math&gt;

A third definition is the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_G(x,y) := \sum_{k\geq0} m_k x^k y^{n-2k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each type has its uses, and all are equivalent by simple transformations.  For instance,
:&lt;math&gt;M_G(x) = x^n m_G(-x^{-2})&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mu_G(x,y) = y^n m_G(x/y^2).&lt;/math&gt;

==Connections to other polynomials==
The first type of matching polynomial is a direct generalization of the [[rook polynomial]].

The second type of matching polynomial has remarkable connections with [[orthogonal polynomials]].  For instance, if ''G''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''K''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[complete bipartite graph]], then the second type of matching polynomial is related to the generalized [[Laguerre polynomial]] ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''&amp;alpha;''&lt;/sup&gt;(''x'') by the identity:

: &lt;math&gt;M_{K_{m,n}}(x) = n! L_n^{(m-n)}(x^2). \, &lt;/math&gt;

If ''G'' is the [[complete graph]] ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is an Hermite polynomial:
: &lt;math&gt;M_{K_n}(x) = H_n(x), \, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''H''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the "probabilist's Hermite polynomial" (1) in the definition of [[Hermite polynomial]]s.  These facts were observed by {{harvtxt|Godsil|1981}}.

If ''G'' is a [[forest (graph theory)|forest]], then its matching polynomial is equal to the [[characteristic polynomial]] of its [[adjacency matrix]].

If ''G'' is a [[Path (graph theory)|path]] or a [[Cycle (graph theory)|cycle]], then ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is a [[Chebyshev polynomial]]. In this case
μ&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(1,''x'') is a [[Fibonacci polynomial]] or [[Lucas polynomial]] respectively.

==Complementation==
The matching polynomial of a graph ''G'' with ''n'' vertices is related to that of its complement by a pair of (equivalent) formulas.  One of them is a simple combinatorial identity due to {{harvtxt|Zaslavsky|1981}}.  The other is an integral identity due to {{harvtxt|Godsil|1981}}.

There is a similar relation for a subgraph ''G'' of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and its complement in ''K''&lt;sub&gt;''m'',''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.  This relation, due to Riordan (1958), was known in the context of non-attacking rook placements and rook polynomials.

==Applications in chemical informatics==
The [[Hosoya index]] of a graph ''G'', its number of matchings, is used in [[chemoinformatics]] as a structural descriptor of a molecular graph. It may be evaluated as ''m''&lt;sub&gt;''G''&lt;/sub&gt;(1) {{harv|Gutman|1991}}.

The third type of matching polynomial was introduced by {{harvtxt|Farrell|1980}} as a version of the "acyclic polynomial" used in [[chemistry]].

==Computational complexity==
On arbitrary graphs, or even [[planar graph]]s, computing the matching polynomial is [[Sharp-P-complete|#P-complete]] {{harv|Jerrum|1987}}. However, it can be computed more efficiently when additional structure about the graph is known. In particular,
computing the matching polynomial on ''n''-vertex graphs of [[treewidth]] ''k'' is [[fixed-parameter tractability|fixed-parameter tractable]]: there exists an algorithm whose running time, for any fixed constant ''k'', is a [[polynomial time|polynomial]] in ''n'' with an exponent that does not depend on ''k'' {{harv|Courcelle|Makowsky|Rotics|2001}}.
The matching polynomial of a graph with ''n'' vertices and [[clique-width]] ''k'' may be computed in time ''n''&lt;sup&gt;O(''k'')&lt;/sup&gt; {{harv|Makowsky|Rotics|Averbouch|Godlin|2006}}

'''''MathWorld''''' is an online [[mathematics]] reference work, created and largely written by [[Eric W. Weisstein]]. It is sponsored by and licensed to Wolfram Research, Inc. and was partially funded by the [[National Science Foundation]]'s [[National Science Digital Library]] grant to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].

==History==
Eric W. Weisstein, the creator of the site, was a [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] student who got into the habit of writing notes on his mathematical readings.  In 1995 he put his notes online and called it "Eric's Treasure Trove of Mathematics." It contained hundreds of pages/articles, covering a wide range of mathematical topics. The site became popular as an extensive single resource on mathematics on the web.  Weisstein continuously improved the notes and accepted corrections and comments from online readers. In 1998, he made a contract with [[CRC Press]] and the contents of the site were published in print and [[CD-ROM]] form, titled "CRC Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics." The free online version became only partially accessible to the public. In 1999 Weisstein went to work for Wolfram Research, Inc. (WRI), and WRI renamed the Math Treasure Trove to ''MathWorld'' and hosted it on the company's website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com|title=Wolfram MathWorld: The Web's Most Extensive Mathematics Resource|first=Weisstein, Eric|last=W.|website=mathworld.wolfram.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; without access restrictions.

==CRC lawsuit==
In 2000, CRC Press sued [[Wolfram Research|Wolfram Research Inc. (WRI)]], WRI president [[Stephen Wolfram]], and author [[Eric Weisstein]], due to what they considered a breach of contract: that the ''MathWorld'' content was to remain in print only. The site was taken down by a court injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5KdGptQAmAC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=mathworld%20copyright&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Value of a Good Idea: Protecting Intellectual Property in an Information Economy|date=2002|publisher=Silver Lake Publishing|isbn=9781563437458|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was later settled out of court, with WRI paying an unspecified&lt;!--?--&gt; amount and complying with other [[stipulation]]s.  Among these stipulations is the inclusion of a copyright notice at the bottom of the website and broad rights for the CRC Press to produce ''MathWorld'' in printed book form.  The site then became once again available free to the public.

This case made a wave of headlines in online publishing circles. The ''[[PlanetMath]]'' project was a result of MathWorld's being unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corneli|first=Joseph|date=2011|title=The PlanetMath Encyclopedia|url=http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-767/paper-03.pdf|journal=ITP 2011 Workshop on Mathematical Wikis (MathWikis 2011) Nijmegen, Netherlands, August 27, 2011|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{floating-point}}

In [[computing]], '''minifloats''' are [[floating-point]] values represented with very few [[bit]]s. Predictably, they are not well suited for general-purpose numerical calculations. They are used for special purposes, most often in computer graphics, where iterations are small and precision has aesthetic effects. Additionally, they are frequently encountered as a pedagogical tool in computer-science courses to demonstrate the properties and structures of [[floating-point number|floating-point]] arithmetic and [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] numbers.

Minifloats with 16 [[bit]]s are [[half precision|half-precision]] numbers (opposed to [[single precision|single]] and [[double precision]]). There are also minifloats with 8 bits or even fewer.

Minifloats can be designed following the principles of the [[IEEE floating-point standard|IEEE 754]] standard. In this case they must obey the (not explicitly written) rules for the frontier between [[subnormal number|subnormal and normal numbers]] and must have special patterns for [[infinity]] and [[NaN]]. Normalized numbers are stored with a [[Exponent bias|biased exponent]]. The new revision of the standard, [[IEEE 754-2008]], has [[Half-precision floating-point format|16-bit binary minifloats]].

The [[Radeon R300]] and [[Radeon R420|R420]] GPUs used an "fp24" floating-point format with 7 bits of exponent and 16 bits (+1 implicit) of mantissa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |chapter-url=http://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems2/gpugems2_chapter32.html |title=GPU Gems |chapter=Chapter 32. Taking the Plunge into GPU Computing |editor-first=Matt |editor-last=Pharr |first=Ian |last=Buck |isbn=0-321-33559-7  |date=2005-03-13 |accessdate=2018-04-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
"Full Precision" in Direct3D 9.0 is a proprietary 24-bit floating-point format. Microsoft's D3D9 (Shader Model 2.0) graphics [[API]] initially supported both FP24 (as in ATI's R300 chip) and FP32 (as in Nvidia's NV30 chip) as "Full Precision", as well as FP16 as "Partial Precision" for vertex and pixel shader calculations performed by the graphics hardware.

In computer graphics minifloats are sometimes used to represent only integral values. If at the same time subnormal values should exist, the least subnormal number has to be 1. This statement can be used to calculate the bias value. The following example demonstrates the calculation, as well as the underlying principles.

== Example ==
A minifloat in 1&amp;nbsp;byte (8 bit) with 1 sign bit, 4 exponent bits and 3 mantissa bits (in short, a 1.4.3.−2 minifloat) should be used to represent integral values. All IEEE 754 principles should be valid. The only free value is the [[exponent bias]], which will come out as −2. The unknown exponent is called for the moment ''x''.

Numbers in a different base are marked as ...{{sub|base}}, for example, 101{{sub|2}} = 5. The bit patterns have spaces to visualize their parts.

=== Representation of zero ===
 0 0000 000 = 0

=== Subnormal numbers ===
The mantissa is extended with "0.":
 0 0000 001 = 0.001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.125 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 (least subnormal number)
 ...
 0 0000 111 = 0.111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.875 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 7 (greatest subnormal number)

=== Normalized numbers ===
The mantissa is extended with "1.":

 0 0001 000 = 1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 (least normalized number)
 0 0001 001 = 1.001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.125 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt; = 9
 ...
 0 0010 000 = 1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = 16
 0 0010 001 = 1.001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.125 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+1&lt;/sup&gt; = 18
 ...
 0 1110 000 = 1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; =  1.000 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; =  65536
 0 1110 001 = 1.001&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; =  1.125 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; =  73728
 ...
 0 1110 110 = 1.110&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; =  1.750 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; = 114688
 0 1110 111 = 1.111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; =  1.875 × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+13&lt;/sup&gt; = 122880 (greatest normalized number)

=== Infinity ===
 0 1111 000 = +infinity
 1 1111 000 = −infinity

If the exponent field were not treated specially, the value would be

 0 1111 000 = 1.000&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+14&lt;/sup&gt; =  2&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; = 131072

=== Not a number ===
 ''x'' 1111 ''yyy'' = NaN (if ''yyy'' ≠ 000)

Without the IEEE 754 special handling of the largest exponent, the greatest possible value would be

 0 1111 111 = 1.111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''+14&lt;/sup&gt; =  1.875 × 2&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt; = 245760

=== Value of the bias ===

If the least subnormal value (second line above) should be 1, the value of ''x'' has to be ''x'' = 3. Therefore the bias has to be −2; that is, every stored exponent has to be decreased by −2 or has to be increased by 2, to get the numerical exponent.

=== All values ===

However, in practice, floats are not shown exactly.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Instead, they are rounded; for example, if a float had about 3 significant digits, and the number 8192 was represented, it would be rounded to 8190 to avoid [[false precision]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

=== Properties of this example ===

[[Image:MinifloatValues 1 4 3 -2 72.png|thumb|Graphical representation of integral (1.4.3.−2) minifloats]]

Integral minifloats in 1&amp;nbsp;byte have a greater range of ±122 880 than [[two's-complement]] integer with a range −128 to +127. The greater range is compensated by a poor precision, because there are only 4 mantissa bits, equivalent to slightly more than one decimal place. They also have greater range than half-precision minifloats with range ±65 504, also compensated by lack of fractions and poor precision.

There are only 242 different values (if +0 and −0 are regarded as different), because 14 bit patterns represent NaN.

The values between 0 and 16 have the same bit pattern as minifloat or two's-complement integer. The first pattern with a different value is 00010001, which is 18 as a minifloat and 17 as a two's-complement integer.

This coincidence does not occur at all with negative values, because this minifloat is a signed-magnitude format.

The (vertical) real line on the right shows clearly the varying density of the floating-point values – a property which is common to any floating-point system. This varying density results in a curve similar to the exponential function.

Although the curve may appear smooth, this is not the case. The graph actually consists of distinct points, and these points lie on line segments with discrete slopes. The value of the exponent bits determines the absolute precision of the mantissa bits, and it is this precision that determines the slope of each linear segment.

== Arithmetic ==
=== Addition ===

[[Image:MinifloatAddition 1 3 2 3 72.png|thumb|Addition of (1.3.2.3)-minifloats]]

The graphic demonstrates the addition of even smaller (1.3.2.3)-minifloats with 6 bits. This floating-point system follows the rules of IEEE 754 exactly. NaN as operand produces always NaN results. Inf&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;Inf and (−Inf)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Inf results in NaN too (green area). Inf can be augmented and decremented by finite values without change. Sums with finite operands can give an infinite result (i.e. 14.0 + 3.0 = +Inf as a result is the cyan area, −Inf is the magenta area). The range of the finite operands is filled with the curves ''x'' + ''y'' = ''c'', where ''c'' is always one of the representable float values (blue and red for positive and negative results respectively).

=== Subtraction, multiplication and division ===

The other arithmetic operations can be illustrated similarly:

In [[linear algebra|linear]] and [[homological algebra]], a '''monad''' is a 3-term complex

: ''A'' → ''B'' → ''C''

of objects in some [[abelian category]] whose middle term ''B'' is [[Projective object|projective]] and whose first map ''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'' is [[injective function|injective]] and whose second map ''B''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''C'' is [[surjective function|surjective]]. Equivalently a monad is a projective object together with a 3-step filtration (''B'' ⊃ ker(''B''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''C'') ⊃ im(''A''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''B'')). In practice ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are often vector bundles over some space, and there are several minor extra conditions that some authors add to the definition. Monads were introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Horrocks|authorlink=Geoffrey Horrocks|year=1964|loc=p.698}}.

'''Noriko H. Arai''' ({{lang-ja|新井紀子}}, born 1962{{r|loc}}) is a Japanese researcher in [[mathematical logic]] and [[artificial intelligence]],{{r|wib}} known for her work on a project to develop [[robot]]s that can pass the [[Examination for Japanese University Admission|entrance examinations]] for the [[University of Tokyo]].{{r|todai}} She is a professor in the information and society research division of the [[National Institute of Informatics]].{{r|todai|nii}}

==Education and career==
Arai was born in Tokyo. She earned a law degree from [[Hitotsubashi University]]{{r|wib}} and then, in 1985, a mathematics degree [[Latin honors|''magna cum laude'']] from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]].{{r|wib|nii}} Her doctorate is from the [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]].{{r|wib}}

She joined the National Institute of Informatics in 2001.{{r|nii}}

==Contributions==
Arai's Todai Robot Project aims to build a [[robot]] that can pass the [[Examination for Japanese University Admission|entrance examinations]] for the [[University of Tokyo]] (commonly known as Todai) by 2021.{{r|todai|nyt}}
Arai became director of the project in 2011.{{r|wib}}
At a 2017 [[TED Talk]], she reported that her system could achieve a score better than 80% of the applicants to the university; however, this was still not a passing score.
Arai sees the success of the project as evidence that human education should concentrate more on problem solving and creativity, and less on rote learning.{{r|bbc}}

Arai is also the founder of Researchmap, "the largest social network for researchers in Japan".{{r|gs10}} She was one of 15 top artificial intelligence researchers invited by French president [[Emmanuel Macron]] to join him in March 2018 for the announcement of a major new French initiative for artificial intelligence research.{{r|xinhua}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8219">In [[mathematics]], '''obstruction theory''' is a name given to two different [[mathematical theory|mathematical theories]], both of which yield [[cohomological]] [[invariant (mathematics)|invariants]].

In the original work of [[Eduard Stiefel|Stiefel]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]], [[characteristic class]]es were defined as obstructions to the existence of certain fields of linear independent [[Vector field|vector]]s. Obstruction theory turns out to be an application of cohomology theory to the problem of constructing a [[Section (fiber bundle)|cross-section]] of a [[Fiber bundle|bundle]].

==In homotopy theory==
The older meaning for obstruction theory in [[homotopy theory]] relates to the procedure, inductive with respect to dimension, for extending a [[continuous mapping]] defined on a [[simplicial complex]], or [[CW complex]]. It is traditionally called ''Eilenberg obstruction theory'', after [[Samuel Eilenberg]]. It involves [[cohomology group]]s with coefficients in [[homotopy group]]s to define obstructions to extensions. For example, with a mapping from a simplicial complex ''X'' to another, ''Y'', defined initially on the [[0-skeleton]] of ''X'' (the vertices of ''X''), an extension to the 1-skeleton will be possible whenever the image of the 0-skeleton will belong to the same [[path-connected]] component of ''Y''. Extending from the 1-skeleton to the 2-skeleton means defining the mapping on each solid triangle from ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary edges. Likewise, then extending the mapping to the 3-skeleton involves extending the mapping to each solid 3-simplex of ''X'', given the mapping already defined on its boundary. 

At some point, say extending the mapping from the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' to the n-skeleton of ''X'', this procedure might be impossible. In that case, one can assign to each n-simplex the homotopy class {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}} of the mapping already defined on its boundary, (at least one of which will be non-zero). These assignments define an [[cohomology|n-cochain]]  with coefficients in {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. Amazingly, this cochain turns out to be a '''cocyle''' and so defines a [[cohomology]] class in the nth cohomology group of ''X'' with coefficients in {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt;(''Y'')}}. When this cohomology class is equal to 0, it turns out that the mapping may be modified within its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton of ''X'' so that the mapping may be extended to the n-skeleton of ''X''.  If the class is not equal to zero, it is called the obstruction to extending the mapping over the n-skeleton, given its homotopy class on the (n-1)-skeleton.

===Obstruction to extending a section of a principal bundle===

====Construction====
Suppose that {{mvar|B}} is a [[simply connected]] simplicial complex and that {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is a [[fibration]] with fiber {{mvar|F}}.  Furthermore, assume that we have a partially defined [[section (fiber bundle)|section]] {{math| ''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; : ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; → ''E''}} on the [[N-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] of {{mvar|B}}.

For every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex {{mvar|Δ}} in {{mvar|B}}, {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be restricted to its boundary (which is a topological [[n-sphere|{{mvar|n}}-sphere]]).  Because {{mvar|p}} send each of these back to each {{mvar|Δ}}, we have a map from an {{mvar|n}}-sphere to {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Δ'')}}. Because fibrations satisfy the homotopy lifting property, and {{mvar|Δ}} is [[Contractible space|contractible]]; {{math|''p''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''Δ'')}} is [[homotopy equivalent]] to {{mvar|F}}. So this partially defined section assigns an element of [[homotopy group|{{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}}]] to every {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplex.  This is precisely the data of a {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}}-valued [[simplicial homology|simplicial]] [[cohomology#definition|cochain]] of degree {{math|''n'' + 1}} on {{mvar|B}}, i.e. an element of {{math|''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(B; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''))}}.  This cochain is called the '''obstruction cochain''' because it being the zero means that all of these elements of {{math|''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'')}} are trivial, which means that our partially defined section can be extended to the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton by using the homotopy between (the partially defined section on the boundary of each {{mvar|Δ}}) and the constant map.

The fact that this cochain came from a partially defined section (as opposed to an arbitrary collection of maps from the all the boundaries of all the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-simplices) can be used to prove that this cochain is a cocycle.  If one started with a different partially defined section {{math|''σ''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} that agreed with the original on the {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then one can also prove that the resulting cocycle would differ from the first by a coboundary.  Therefore we have a well-defined element of the cohomology group {{math|''H''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt;(''B''; ''π''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F''))}} such that if a partially defined section on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton exists that agrees with the given choice on the {{math|(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)}}-skeleton, then this cohomology class must be trivial.

The converse is also true if one allows such things as ''homotopy sections'', i.e. a map {{math|''σ'' : ''B'' → ''E''}} such that {{math|''p'' ∘ ''σ''}} is homotopic (as opposed to equal) to the identity map on {{mvar|B}}.  Thus it provides a complete invariant of the existence of sections up to homotopy on the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-skeleton.

====Applications====
* By inducting over {{mvar|n}}, one can construct a ''first obstruction to a section'' as the first of the above cohomology classes that is non-zero. 
* This can be used to find obstructions to trivializations of [[principal bundle#Trivializations and cross sections|principal bundles]].
* Because [[homotopy fiber|any map can be turned into a fibration]], this construction can be used to see if there are obstructions to the existence of a lift (up to homotopy) of a map into {{mvar|B}} to a map into {{mvar|E}} even if {{math|''p'' : ''E'' → ''B''}} is not a fibration.
* It is crucial to the construction of [[Postnikov system]]s.

==In geometric topology==
In [[geometric topology]], obstruction theory is concerned with when a [[topological manifold]] has a [[piecewise linear structure]], and when a piecewise linear manifold has a [[differential structure]].

In dimension at most 2 (Rado), and 3 (Moise), the notions of topological manifolds and piecewise linear manifolds coincide. In dimension 4 they are not the same.

In dimensions at most 6 the notions of piecewise linear manifolds and differentiable manifolds coincide.

==In surgery theory==
The two basic questions of [[surgery theory]] are whether a topological space with ''n''-dimensional [[Poincaré duality]] is [[homotopy equivalent]] to an ''n''-dimensional [[manifold]], and also whether a [[homotopy equivalence]] of ''n''-dimensional manifolds is [[homotopic]] to a [[diffeomorphism]]. In both cases there are two obstructions for ''n&gt;9'', a primary [[topological K-theory]] obstruction to the existence of a [[vector bundle]]: if this vanishes there exists a [[normal invariant|normal map]], allowing the definition of the secondary [[surgery theory|surgery obstruction]] in [[L-theory|algebraic L-theory]] to performing surgery on the normal map to obtain a [[homotopy equivalence]].

      <comment>Onsets, as the article explains (sort of) are not entirely described by a change in amplitude from 0 to a higher value. There maybe no change in amplitude/intensity, but a change in pitch/spectral content.</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2669">'''Onset''' refers to the beginning of a [[musical note]] or other sound. It is related to (but different from) the concept of a [[Transient (acoustics)|transient]]: all musical notes have an onset, but do not necessarily include an initial transient.

In [[phonetics]] the term is used differently - see [[syllable onset]].

==Onset detection==

In [[signal processing]], '''onset detection''' is an active research area. For example, the [[MIREX]] annual competition features an [http://www.music-ir.org/mirex/wiki/2011:Audio_Onset_Detection Audio Onset Detection contest].

Approaches to onset detection can operate in the [[time domain]], [[frequency domain]], [[Phase (waves)|phase]] domain, or [[Complex plane|complex domain]], and include looking for:

* Increases in spectral energy
* Changes in spectral energy distribution ([[spectral flux]]) or [[Phase (waves)|phase]]
* Changes in detected pitch - e.g. using a [[polyphony|polyphonic]] [[pitch detection algorithm]]
* Spectral patterns recognisable by [[machine learning]] techniques such as [[neural network]]s.

Simpler techniques such as detecting increases in time-domain amplitude can typically lead to an unsatisfactorily high amount of [[false positive]]s or [[false negative]]s.

The aim is often to judge onsets similarly to how a human would: so [[Psychoacoustics|psychoacoustically]]-motivated strategies may be employed. Sometimes the onset detector can be restricted to a particular domain (depending on intended application), for example being targeted at detecting percussive onsets. With a narrower focus, it can be more straightforward to obtain reliable detection.

{{hatnote|This article uses common abstract notations, such as &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y(t) = x(t) * h(t),&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; or &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle y(t) = \mathcal{H}\{x(t)\},&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; in which it is understood that the functions should be thought of in their totality, rather than at specific instants &lt;math&gt;t.&lt;/math&gt;  (see [[Convolution#Notation]])}}

In [[signal processing]], the '''overlap–add method (OA, OLA)''' is an efficient way to evaluate the discrete [[convolution]] of a very long signal &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; with a [[finite impulse response]] (FIR) filter &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt;''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y[n] = x[n] * h[n] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty} h[m] \cdot x[n-m]
= \sum_{m=1}^{M} h[m] \cdot x[n-m],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''h''[''m''] = 0 for ''m'' outside the region [1, ''M''].

The concept is to divide the problem into multiple convolutions of ''h''[''n''] with short segments of &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt;''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;x_k[n]  \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} 
\begin{cases}
x[n+kL] &amp; n=1,2,\ldots,L\\
0 &amp; \textrm{otherwise},
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''L'' is an arbitrary segment length.  Then''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;x[n] = \sum_{k} x_k[n-kL],\,&lt;/math&gt;

and ''y''[''n''] can be written as a sum of short convolutions''':'''

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
y[n] = \left(\sum_{k} x_k[n-kL]\right) * h[n] &amp;= \sum_{k} \left(x_k[n-kL]* h[n]\right)\\
&amp;= \sum_{k} y_k[n-kL],
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;y_k[n] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=} \ x_k[n]*h[n]\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; is zero outside the region [1,&amp;nbsp;''L''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1]. &amp;nbsp;And for any parameter &amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;N\ge L+M-1,\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; it is equivalent to the &lt;math&gt;N\,&lt;/math&gt;-point [[circular convolution]] of &lt;math&gt;x_k[n]\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h[n]\,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp; in the region&amp;nbsp;[1,&amp;nbsp;''N''].

The advantage is that the [[circular convolution]] can be computed very efficiently as follows, according to the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Circular convolution theorem and cross-correlation theorem|circular convolution theorem]]''':'''

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;y_k[n] = \textrm{IFFT}\left(\textrm{FFT}\left(x_k[n]\right)\cdot\textrm{FFT}\left(h[n]\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}

where FFT and IFFT refer to the [[fast Fourier transform]] and inverse
fast Fourier transform, respectively, evaluated over &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; discrete
points.

== The algorithm ==

[[Image:Depiction of overlap-add algorithm.png|frame|none|Figure 1: the overlap–add method]]

Fig. 1 sketches the idea of the overlap–add method. The
signal &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; is first partitioned into non-overlapping sequences,
then the [[discrete Fourier transform]]s of the sequences &lt;math&gt;y_k[n]&lt;/math&gt;
are evaluated by multiplying the FFT of &lt;math&gt;x_k[n]&lt;/math&gt; with the FFT of
&lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt;. After recovering of &lt;math&gt;y_k[n]&lt;/math&gt; by inverse FFT, the resulting
output signal is reconstructed by overlapping and adding the &lt;math&gt;y_k[n]&lt;/math&gt;
as shown in the figure. The overlap arises from the fact that a linear
convolution is always longer than the original sequences. In the early days of development of the fast Fourier transform, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; was often  chosen to be a power of 2 for efficiency, but further development has revealed efficient transforms for larger prime factorizations of L, reducing computational sensitivity to this parameter. A [[pseudocode]] of the algorithm is the
following:

    '''Algorithm 1''' (''OA for linear convolution'')
    Evaluate the best value of N and L (L&gt;0, N = M+L-1 nearest to power of 2).
    Nx = length(x);
    H = FFT(h,N)       &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(''zero-padded FFT'')&lt;/span&gt;
    i = 1
    y = zeros(1, M+Nx-1)
    '''while''' i &lt;= Nx  &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(''Nx: the last index of x[n]'')&lt;/span&gt;
        il = min(i+L-1,Nx)
        yt = IFFT( FFT(x(i:il),N) * H, N)
        k  = min(i+N-1,M+Nx-1)
        y(i:k) = y(i:k) + yt(1:k-i+1)    &lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;(''add the overlapped output blocks'')&lt;/span&gt;
        i = i+L
    '''end'''
This algorithm is based on the linearity of the DFT.

== Circular convolution with the overlap–add method ==

When sequence ''x''[''n''] is periodic, and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; is the period, then ''y''[''n''] is also periodic, with the same period. &amp;nbsp;To compute one period of y[n], Algorithm 1 can first be used to convolve ''h''[''n''] with just one period of ''x''[''n'']. &amp;nbsp;In the region ''M'' ≤ ''n'' ≤ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;nbsp;the resultant ''y''[''n''] sequence is correct. &amp;nbsp;And if the next ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 values are added to the first ''M''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 values, then the region 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ ''N''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; will represent the desired convolution.  The modified pseudocode is''':'''

    '''Algorithm 2''' (''OA for circular convolution'')
    Evaluate Algorithm 1
    y(1:M-1) = y(1:M-1) + y(Nx+1:Nx+M-1)
    y = y(1:Nx)
    '''end'''

== Cost of the overlap-add method ==

The cost of the convolution can be associated to the number of complex
multiplications involved in the operation. The major computational
effort is due to the FFT operation, which for a radix-2 algorithm
applied to a signal of length &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; roughly calls for &lt;math&gt;C=\frac{N}{2}\log_2 N&lt;/math&gt;
complex multiplications. It turns out that the number of complex multiplications
of the overlap-add method are:

:&lt;math&gt;C_{OA}=\left\lceil \frac{N_x}{N-M+1}\right\rceil
N\left(\log_2 N+1\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;C_{OA}&lt;/math&gt; accounts for the FFT+filter multiplication+IFFT operation.

The additional cost of the &lt;math&gt;M_L&lt;/math&gt; sections involved in the circular
version of the overlap–add method is usually very small and can be
neglected for the sake of simplicity. The best value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;
can be found by numerical search of the minimum of &lt;math&gt;C_{OA}\left(N\right)=C_{OA}\left(2^m \right)&lt;/math&gt;
by spanning the integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; in the range &lt;math&gt;\log_2\left(M\right)\le m\le\log_2 \left(N_x\right)&lt;/math&gt;.
Being &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; a power of two, the FFTs of the overlap–add method
are computed efficiently. Once evaluated the value of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; it
turns out that the optimal partitioning of &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;L=N-M+1&lt;/math&gt;.
For comparison, the cost of the standard circular convolution of &lt;math&gt;x[n]&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;h[n]&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;C_S=N_x\left(\log_2 N_x+1\right)\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the cost of the overlap–add method scales almost as &lt;math&gt;O\left(N_x\log_2 N\right)&lt;/math&gt;
while the cost of the standard circular convolution method is almost
&lt;math&gt;O\left(N_x\log_2 N_x \right)&lt;/math&gt;. However such functions accounts
only for the cost of the complex multiplications, regardless of the
other operations involved in the algorithm. A direct measure of the
computational time required by the algorithms is of much interest.
Fig. 2 shows the ratio of the measured time to evaluate
a standard circular convolution using &amp;nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} with
the time elapsed by the same convolution using the overlap–add method
in the form of Alg 2, vs. the sequence and the filter length. Both algorithms have been implemented under [[Matlab]]. The
bold line represent the boundary of the region where the overlap–add
method is faster (ratio&gt;1) than the standard circular convolution.
Note that the overlap–add method in the tested cases can be three
times faster than the standard method.

[[Image:gain oa method.png|frame|none|Figure 2: Ratio between the time required by &amp;nbsp;{{EquationNote|Eq.1}} and the time required by the overlap–add Alg. 2 to evaluate
a complex circular convolution, vs the sequence length &lt;math&gt;N_x&lt;/math&gt; and
the filter length &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.]]

In [[theoretical computer science]], in particular in [[term rewriting]], a '''path ordering''' is a [[well-founded]] [[strict total order]] (&gt;) on the set of all [[term (logic)|terms]] such that 
:''f''(...) &gt; ''g''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) &amp;nbsp; if &amp;nbsp; ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; ''g'' &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; ''f''(...) &gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''i''=1,...,''n'',
where (&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&gt;) is a user-given [[strict total order|total precedence order]] on the set of all [[term (logic)#Formal definition|function symbols]].

Intuitively, a term ''f''(...) is bigger than any term ''g''(...) built from terms ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; smaller than ''f''(...) using a
lower-precedence root symbol ''g''.
In particular, by [[structural induction]], a term ''f''(...) is bigger than any term containing only symbols smaller than ''f''.

A path ordering is often used as [[reduction ordering]] in term rewriting, in particular in the [[Knuth–Bendix completion algorithm]].
As an example, a term rewriting system for "[[Elementary algebra#Evaluating expressions|multiplying out]]" mathematical expressions could contain a rule ''x''*(''y''+''z'') → (''x''*''y'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(''x''*''z''). In order to prove [[termination (term rewriting)|termination]], a [[reduction ordering]] (&gt;) must be found with respect to which the term ''x''*(''y''+''z'') is greater than the term  (''x''*''y'')+(''x''*''z''). This is not trivial, since the former term contains both fewer function symbols and fewer variables than the latter. However, setting the precedence (*) &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; (+), a path ordering can be used, since both ''x''*(''y''+''z'') &gt; ''x''*''y'' and ''x''*(''y''+''z'') &gt; ''x''*''z'' is easy to achieve.

Given two terms ''s'' and ''t'', with a root symbol ''f'' and ''g'', respectively, to decide their relation their root symbols are compared first.
* If ''f'' &lt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; ''g'', then ''s'' can dominate ''t'' only if one of ''s'''s subterms does.
* If ''f'' &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; ''g'', then ''s'' dominates ''t'' if ''s'' dominates each of ''t'''s subterms.
* If ''f'' = ''g'', then the immediate [[term (logic)#Operations with terms|subterms]] of ''s'' and ''t'' need to be compared recursively. Depending on the particular method, different variations of path orderings exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Nachum Dershowitz]], [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud]]| title=Rewrite Systems| year=1990| volume=B| pages=243–320| publisher=Elsevier| editor=[[Jan van Leeuwen]]| series=Handbook of Theoretical Computer Science}} Here: sect.5.3, p.275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Gerard Huet| title=Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction| date=May 1986| series=International Summer School on Logic of Programming and Calculi of Discrete Design| url=http://yquem.inria.fr/~huet/PUBLIC/Formal_Structures.ps.gz| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171331/http://yquem.inria.fr/~huet/PUBLIC/Formal_Structures.ps.gz| archivedate=2014-07-14| df=}} Here: chapter 4, p.55-64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definitions==

The '''multiset path ordering''' (&gt;) can be defined as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Huet (1986), sect.4.3, def.1, p.57&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
| colspan=9 | ''s'' = ''f''(''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;) &gt; ''t'' = ''g''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) 
| if
|-
| ''f'' 
| &lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; 
| ''g'' 
| and 
| ''s'' 
| &gt; 
| ''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; 
| for each 
| ''j''∈{1,...,''n''}, &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; 
| or
|-
|
|
| 
|
| ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; 
| ≥
| ''t'' 
| for some 
| ''i''∈{1,...,''m''},
| or
|-
| ''f''
| =
| ''g''
| and 
| colspan=5 | &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt;
|}

where 
* (≥) denotes the [[reflexive closure]] of the mpo (&gt;),
* &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt; denotes the [[multiset]] of ''s''’s subterms, similar for ''t'', and 
* (&gt;&gt;) denotes the multiset extension of (&gt;), defined by &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt; if &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt; can be obtained from &lt;u&gt;{&lt;/u&gt; ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''s''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;u&gt;}&lt;/u&gt;
** by deleting at least one element, or
** by replacing an element by a multiset of strictly smaller (w.r.t. the mpo) elements.&lt;ref&gt;Huet (1986), sect.4.1.3, p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, an '''order [[Higher-order function|functional]]''' is a function ''O'' mapping an ordering to another one, and satisfying the following properties:&lt;ref&gt;Huet (1986), sect.4.3, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt;
* If (&gt;) is [[transitive relation|transitive]], then so is ''O''(&gt;).
* If (&gt;) is [[irreflexive]], then so is ''O''(&gt;).
* If ''s'' &gt; ''t'', then ''f''(...,''s'',...) ''O''(&gt;) ''f''(...,''t'',...).
* ''O'' is [[Continuous function (set theory)|continuous]] on relations, i.e. if ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ... is an infinite sequence of relations, then ''O''(∪{{su|b=''i''=0|p=∞}} ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ∪{{su|b=''i''=0|p=∞}} ''O''(''R''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;).

The multiset extension, mapping (&gt;) above to (&gt;&gt;) above is one example of an order functional: (&gt;&gt;)=''O''(&gt;).
Another order functional is the [[Lexicographical order|lexicographic]] extension, leading to the '''lexicographic path ordering'''.

Broadly speaking, '''pure mathematics''' is [[mathematics]] that studies entirely abstract [[concept]]s.  This has been a recognizable category of mathematical activity from the 19th century onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piaggio|first1=H|title=Three Sadleirian Professors: A.R. Forsyth, E.W. Hobson and G.H.

Another view is that pure mathematics is ''not necessarily'' [[applied mathematics]]: it is possible to study abstract entities with respect to their intrinsic nature and not be concerned with how they manifest in the real world.&lt;ref name=Magid/&gt; Even though the pure and applied viewpoints are distinct philosophical positions, in practice there is much overlap in the activity of pure and applied mathematicians.

To develop accurate models for describing the real world, many applied mathematicians draw on tools and techniques that are often considered to be "pure" mathematics. On the other hand, many pure mathematicians draw on natural and social phenomena as inspiration for their abstract research.

==History==

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greek mathematicians were among the earliest to make a distinction between pure and applied mathematics. [[Plato]] helped to create the gap between "arithmetic", now called [[number theory]], and "logistic", now called [[arithmetic]]. Plato regarded logistic (arithmetic) as appropriate for businessmen and men of war who "must learn the art of numbers or [they] will not know how to array [their] troops" and arithmetic (number theory) as appropriate for philosophers "because [they have] to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=The age of Plato and Aristotle|pages=86|quote=Plato is important in the history of mathematics largely for his role as inspirer and director of others, and perhaps to him is due the sharp distinction in ancient Greece between arithmetic (in the sense of the theory of numbers) and logistic (the technique of computation). Plato regarded logistic as appropriate for the businessman and for the man of war, who "must learn the art of numbers or he will not know how to array his troops." The philosopher, on the other hand, must be an arithmetician "because he has to arise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being."}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid of Alexandria]], when asked by one of his students of what use was the study of geometry, asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Euclid of Alexandria |pages=101 |quote=Evidently Euclid did not stress the practical aspects of his subject, for there is a tale told of him that when one of his students asked of what use was the study of geometry, Euclid asked his slave to give the student threepence, "since he must make gain of what he learns."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek mathematician [[Apollonius of Perga]] was asked about the usefulness of some of his theorems in Book IV of ''Conics'' to which he proudly asserted,&lt;ref name="Apollonius"&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl B. |last=Boyer |authorlink=Carl Benjamin Boyer |title=A History of Mathematics |edition=Second |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |year=1991 |isbn=0-471-54397-7|chapter=Apollonius of Perga|pages=152|quote=It is in connection with the theorems in this book that Apollonius makes a statement implying that in his day, as in ours, there were narrow-minded opponents of pure mathematics who pejoratively inquired about the usefulness of such results. The author proudly asserted: "They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason." (Heath 1961, p.lxxiv).&lt;BR&gt;The preface to Book V, relating to maximum and minimum straight lines drawn to a conic, again argues that the subject is one of those that seem "worthy of study for their own sake." While one must admire the author for his lofty intellectual attitude, it may be pertinently pointed out that s day was beautiful theory, with no prospect of applicability to the science or engineering of his time, has since become fundamental in such fields as terrestrial dynamics and celestial mechanics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;They are worthy of acceptance for the sake of the demonstrations themselves, in the same way as we accept many other things in mathematics for this and for no other reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And since many of his results were not applicable to the science or engineering of his day, Apollonius further argued in the preface of the fifth book of ''Conics'' that the subject is one of those that "...seem worthy of study for their own sake."&lt;ref name="Apollonius"/&gt;

===19th century===
The term itself is enshrined in the full title of the [[Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics|Sadleirian Chair]], founded (as a professorship) in the mid-nineteenth century. The idea of a separate discipline of ''pure'' mathematics may have emerged at that time. The generation of [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] made no sweeping distinction of the kind, between ''pure'' and ''applied''. In the following years, specialisation and professionalisation (particularly in the [[Weierstrass]] approach to [[mathematical analysis]]) started to make a rift more apparent.

===20th century===
At the start of the twentieth century mathematicians took up the [[axiomatic method]], strongly influenced by [[David Hilbert]]'s example. The logical formulation of '''pure mathematics''' suggested by [[Bertrand Russell]] in terms of a [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]] structure of [[Proposition (mathematics)|proposition]]s seemed more and more plausible, as large parts of mathematics became axiomatised and thus subject to the simple criteria of ''[[rigorous proof]]''.

In fact in an axiomatic setting ''rigorous'' adds nothing to the idea of ''proof''. Pure mathematics, according to a view that can be ascribed to the [[Bourbaki group]], is what is proved. '''Pure mathematician''' became a recognized vocation, achievable through training.

The case was made that pure mathematics is useful in [[engineering education]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Hathaway]] (1901) [http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1901-07-06/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5/S0002-9904-1901-00797-5.pdf "Pure mathematics for engineering students"], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 7(6):266–71.&lt;/ref&gt;
:There is a training in habits of thought, points of view, and intellectual comprehension of ordinary engineering problems, which only the study of higher mathematics can give.

==Generality and abstraction==
One central concept in pure mathematics is the idea of generality; pure mathematics often exhibits a trend towards increased generality. Uses and advantages of generality include the following:

* Generalizing theorems or mathematical structures can lead to deeper understanding of the original theorems or structures
* Generality can simplify the presentation of material, resulting in shorter proofs or arguments that are easier to follow.
* One can use generality to avoid duplication of effort, proving a general result instead of having to prove separate cases independently, or using results from other areas of mathematics.
* Generality can facilitate connections between different branches of mathematics. [[Category theory]] is one area of mathematics dedicated to exploring this commonality of structure as it plays out in some areas of math.

Generality's impact on [[intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is both dependent on the subject and a matter of personal preference or learning style.  Often generality is seen as a hindrance to intuition, although it can certainly function as an aid to it, especially when it provides analogies to material for which one already has good intuition.

As a prime example of generality, the [[Erlangen program]] involved an expansion of [[geometry]] to accommodate [[non-Euclidean geometries]] as well as the field of [[topology]], and other forms of geometry, by viewing geometry as the study of a space together with a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] of transformations.  The study of [[number]]s, called [[algebra]] at the beginning undergraduate level, extends to [[abstract algebra]] at a more advanced level; and the study of [[function (mathematics)|function]]s, called [[calculus]] at the college freshman level becomes [[mathematical analysis]] and [[functional analysis]] at a more advanced level.  Each of these branches of more ''abstract'' mathematics have many sub-specialties, and there are in fact many connections between pure mathematics and applied mathematics disciplines. A steep rise in [[abstraction]] was seen mid 20th century.

In practice, however, these developments led to a sharp divergence from [[physics]], particularly from 1950 to 1983. Later this was criticised, for example by [[Vladimir Arnold]], as too much [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]], not enough [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]]. The point does not yet seem to be settled, in that [[string theory]] pulls one way, while [[discrete mathematics]] pulls back towards proof as central.

==Purism==
Mathematicians have always had differing opinions regarding the distinction between pure and applied mathematics. 
One of the most famous (but perhaps misunderstood) modern examples of this debate can be found in [[G.H. Hardy]]'s ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''.

It is widely believed that Hardy considered applied mathematics to be ugly and dull. Although it is true that Hardy preferred pure mathematics, which he often compared to [[painting]] and [[poetry]], Hardy saw the distinction between pure and applied mathematics to be simply that applied mathematics sought to express ''physical'' truth in a mathematical framework, whereas pure mathematics expressed truths that were independent of the physical world. Hardy made a separate distinction in mathematics between what he called "real" mathematics, "which has permanent aesthetic value", and "the dull and elementary parts of mathematics" that have practical use.

Hardy considered some physicists, such as [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], and [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]], to be among the "real" mathematicians, but at the time that he was writing the ''Apology'' he also considered [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]] to be "useless", which allowed him to hold the opinion that only "dull" mathematics was useful. Moreover, Hardy briefly admitted that—just as the application of [[matrix theory]] and [[group theory]] to physics had come unexpectedly—the time may come where some kinds of beautiful, "real" mathematics may be useful as well.

Another insightful view is offered by Magid:
{{quote|I've always thought that a good model here could be drawn from ring theory. In that subject, one has the subareas of [[commutative ring|commutative ring theory]] and [[non-commutative ring|non-commutative ring theory]]. An uninformed observer might think that these represent a dichotomy, but in fact the latter subsumes the former: a non-commutative ring is a not-necessarily-commutative ring. If we use similar conventions, then we could refer to applied mathematics and nonapplied mathematics, where by the latter we ''mean not-necessarily-applied mathematics''... [emphasis added]&lt;ref name=Magid&gt;[[Andy Magid]] (November 2005) [http://www.ams.org/notices/200510/commentary.pdf Letter from the Editor], [[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]], page 1173&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Subfields==
[[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]] is concerned with the properties of functions. It deals with concepts such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[limit of a function|limits]], [[derivative|differentiation]] and [[integral|integration]], thus providing a rigorous foundation for the [[calculus]] of infinitesimals introduced by Newton and Leibniz in the 17th century. [[Real analysis]] studies functions of real numbers, while [[complex analysis]] extends the aforementioned concepts to functions of complex numbers.  [[Functional analysis]] is a branch of analysis that studies infinite-dimensional vector spaces and views functions as points in these spaces.

[[Abstract algebra]] is not to be confused with the manipulation of formulae that is covered in secondary education. It studies [[Set (mathematics)|sets]] together with [[binary operations]] defined on them. Sets and their binary operations may be classified according to their properties: for instance, if an operation is [[associative]] on a set that contains an identity element and inverses for each member of the set, the set and operation is considered to be a [[group (mathematics)|group]]. Other structures include [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], [[vector spaces]] and [[Lattice (group)|lattices]].

[[Geometry]] is the study of shapes and space, in particular, groups of transformations that act on spaces. For example, [[projective geometry]] is about the group of projective transformations that act on the real projective plane, whereas [[inversive geometry]] is concerned with the group of inversive transformations acting on the extended complex plane.

[[Number theory]] is the theory of the positive [[integers]]. It is based on ideas such as divisibility and [[modular arithmetic|congruence]]. Its [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic|fundamental theorem]] states that each positive integer has a unique prime factorization. In some ways it is the most accessible discipline in pure mathematics for the general public: for instance the [[Goldbach conjecture]] is easily stated (but is yet to be proved or disproved). In other ways it is the least accessible discipline; for example, Wiles' proof that Fermat's equation has no nontrivial solutions requires understanding [[automorphic forms]], which though intrinsic to nature have not found a place in physics or the general public discourse.

[[Topology]] is a modern extension of Geometry. Rather than focusing on the sizes of objects and their precise measurement, topology involves the properties of spaces or objects that are preserved under smooth operations such as bending or twisting (but not, for example, tearing or shearing). Topology's subfields interact with other branches of pure math: traditional topology uses ideas from [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]], such as metric spaces, and [[algebraic topology]] relies on ideas from [[combinatorics]] in addition to those of analysis.

[[Combinatorics]] is a branch of mathematics concerning the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It also interacts with many other areas of mathematics. For example, additive combinatorics is related to [[number theory]] and [[analysis]], and [[graph theory]] comes from [[topology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2810">In [[mathematics]] and [[computing]], a '''[[radix]] point''' (or '''radix character''') is the symbol used in numerical representations to separate the [[integer]] part of a number (to the left of the radix point) from its [[fraction (mathematics)|fractional]] part (to the right of the radix point).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Essential Mathematics for Games and Interactive Applications: A Programmer's Guide|first1=James M.|last1=Van Verth|first2=Lars M.|last2=Bishop|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=9780123742971|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zkEY9RIm4WkC&amp;pg=PA7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "Radix point" applies to all [[radix|number base]]s. In [[decimal|base 10]] notation, the radix point is more commonly called the [[decimal point]], where the prefix [[wikt:deci-|deci-]] implies base 10.  Similarly, the term "binary point" is used for [[binary numeral system|base 2]].

In [[List of countries where English is an official language|English-speaking countries]], the radix point is usually a small dot (.) placed either on the baseline or halfway between the baseline and the top of the [[Numeral system|numerals]]. In many other countries, the radix point is a comma (,) placed on the baseline. It is important to know which notation is being used when working in different software programs. The respective [[ISO 31-0#Numbers|ISO standard]] defines both the comma and the small dot as decimal markers, but does not explicitly define universal radix marks for bases other than 10.

==Examples== 
* In base 10 (decimal):  13.625
: In this example, 13 is the integer to the left of the radix point, and 625 (i.e. 625/1000) is the fractional part to the right.

* In base 2 (binary): 1101.101
: The binary number 1101.101 has the following digits:
{| class="wikitable" style="width:50%;table-layout:fixed;text-align:center;"
|-
! width="125pt;"|Power of 2
| 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 || || −1 || −2 || −3
|-
! Binary digit
| 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 || '''.''' || 1 || 0 || 1
|}

Hence, its decimal value can be calculated as:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
1101.101_2
&amp;= 1 \times 2^3 + 1 \times 2^2 + 0 \times 2^1 + 1 \times 2^0 + 1 \times 2^{-1} + 0 \times 2^{-2} + 1 \times 2^{-3} \\
&amp;= 1 \times 8 + 1 \times 4 + 0 \times 2 + 1 \times 1 + 1 \times 0.5 + 0 \times 0.25 + 1 \times 0.125 \\
&amp;= 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.125 \\
&amp;= 13.625_{10}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

It is now seen that 1101, which is to the left of the radix point, is the binary representation of the decimal number 13.  To the right of the radix point is 101, which is the binary representation of the decimal fraction 625/1000 (or 5/8).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9441">In [[algebra]], the '''rational root theorem''' (or '''rational root test''', '''rational zero theorem''', '''rational zero test''' or '''''p''/''q'' theorem''') states a constraint on [[rational number|rational]] [[Equation solving|solutions]] of a [[polynomial equation]]
:&lt;math&gt;a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;
with [[integer]] coefficients. Solutions of the equation are [[root of a polynomial|roots]] (equivalently, zeroes) of the [[polynomial]] on the left side of the equation.

If ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are nonzero,
then each [[rational number|rational]] solution  ''x'',

* ''p'' is an integer [[divisor|factor]] of the [[constant term]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and
* ''q'' is an integer factor of the leading [[coefficient]] ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

The rational root theorem is a special case (for a single linear factor) of [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]] on the factorization of polynomials. The '''integral root theorem''' is a special case of the rational root theorem if the leading coefficient&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.

==Application==

The theorem is used in order to determine whether a polynomial has any rational roots, and if so to find them. Since the theorem gives constraints on the numerator and denominator of the fully reduced rational roots as being divisors of certain numbers, all possible combinations of divisors can be checked and either the rational roots will be found or it will be determined that there are none. If one or more are found, they can be factored out of the polynomial, resulting in a polynomial of lower degree whose roots are also roots of the original polynomial.

===Cubic equation===

The general [[cubic equation]]

:&lt;math&gt;ax^3+bx^2+cx+d=0&lt;/math&gt;

with integer coefficients has three solutions in the [[complex plane]]. If it is found by the rational root test that there are no rational solutions, then the only way to express the solutions [[algebraic expression|algebraically]] is to use [[cube root]]s. But if the test finds three rational solutions, then the cube roots are avoided. And if precisely one rational solution ''r'' is found to exist, then (''x'' – ''r'') can be factored out of the cubic polynomial using [[polynomial long division]], leaving a [[quadratic polynomial]] whose two roots are the remaining two roots of the cubic; and these can be found using the [[quadratic formula]], again avoiding the use of cube roots.

==Proofs==

===First proof===

Let ''P''(''x'') = ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for some ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ '''Z''', and suppose ''P''(''p''/''q'') = 0 for some [[coprime]] ''p'', ''q'' ∈ '''Z''':

:&lt;math&gt;P\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right) = a_n\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right)^n + a_{n-1}\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right)^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1\left(\tfrac{p}{q}\right) + a_0 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

If we multiply both sides by ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, shift the constant term to the right hand side, and factor out ''p'' on the left hand side, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad p(a_np^{n-1} + a_{n-1}qp^{n-2} + \cdots + a_1q^{n-1}) = -a_0q^n.&lt;/math&gt;

We see that ''p'' times the integer quantity in parentheses equals −''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so ''p'' divides ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. But ''p'' is coprime to ''q'' and therefore to ''q''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, so by (the generalized form of) [[Euclid's lemma]] it must divide the remaining factor ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the product.

If we instead shift the leading term to the right hand side and factor out ''q'' on the left hand side, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\qquad q(a_{n-1}p^{n-1} + a_{n-2}qp^{n-2} + \cdots + a_0q^{n-1}) = -a_np^n.&lt;/math&gt;

And for similar reasons, we can conclude that ''q'' divides ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Arnold |first2=G. |last2=Arnold |title=Four unit mathematics |publisher=Edward Arnold |year=1993 |isbn=0-340-54335-3 |pages=120–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proof using Gauss' lemma===

Should there be a nontrivial factor dividing all the coefficients of the polynomial, then one can divide by the [[greatest common divisor]] of the coefficients so as to obtain a primitive polynomial in the sense of [[Gauss's lemma (polynomial)|Gauss's lemma]]; this does not alter the set of rational roots and only strengthens the divisibility conditions. That lemma says that if the polynomial factors in {{math|ℚ[''X'']}}, then it also factors in {{math|ℤ[''X'']}} as a product of primitive polynomials. Now any rational root {{math|''p''/''q''}} corresponds to a factor of degree 1 in {{math|ℚ[''X'']}} of the polynomial, and its primitive representative is then {{math|''qx'' − ''p''}}, assuming that ''p'' and ''q'' are coprime. But any multiple in {{math|ℤ[''X'']}} of {{math|''qx'' − ''p''}} has leading term divisible by ''q'' and constant term divisible by ''p'', which proves the statement. This argument shows that more generally, any irreducible factor of ''P'' can be supposed to have integer coefficients, and leading and constant coefficients dividing the corresponding coefficients of&amp;nbsp;''P''.

==Examples==

===First===

In the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;2x^3+x-1,&lt;/math&gt;

any rational root fully reduced would have to have a numerator that divides evenly into 1 and a denominator that divides evenly into 2. Hence the only possible rational roots are ±1/2 and ±1; since neither of these equates the polynomial to zero, it has no rational roots.

===Second===
In the polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;x^3-7x+6&lt;/math&gt;

the only possible rational roots would have a numerator that divides 6 and a denominator that divides 1, limiting the possibilities to ±1, ±2, ±3, and ±6. Of these, 1, 2, and –3 equate the polynomial to zero, and hence are its rational roots. (In fact these are its only roots since a cubic has only three roots; in general, a polynomial could have some rational and some [[irrational number|irrational]] roots.)

===Third===

Every rational root of the polynomial
:&lt;math&gt;3x^3 - 5x^2 + 5x - 2 &lt;/math&gt;
must be among the numbers symbolically indicated by
: &lt;math&gt;\pm\frac{1,2}{1,3}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which gives the list of 8 possible answers:
:&lt;math&gt;\pm\left\{1, 2, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}\right\} .&lt;/math&gt;

These root candidates can be tested using [[Horner's method]] (for instance). In this particular case there is exactly one rational root. If a root candidate does not cause the polynomial to equal zero, it can be used to shorten the list of remaining candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=King |first=Jeremy D. |title=Integer roots of polynomials |journal=Mathematical Gazette |volume=90 |date= November 2006 |pages=455–456 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 does not work, as the polynomial then equals&amp;nbsp;1. This means that substituting ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''t'' yields a polynomial in&amp;nbsp;''t'' with constant term&amp;nbsp;1, while the coefficient of ''t''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; remains the same as the coefficient of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Applying the rational root theorem thus yields the following possible roots for&amp;nbsp;''t'':

:&lt;math&gt;t=\pm\frac{1}{1,3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;x = 1+t = 2, 0, \frac{4}{3}, \frac{2}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Root candidates that do not occur on both lists are ruled out. The list of rational root candidates has thus shrunk to just ''x'' = 2 and ''x'' =&amp;nbsp;2/3.

If ''k'' rational roots are found (''k'' ≥ 1), Horner's method will also yield a polynomial of degree ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''k'' whose roots, together with the rational roots, are exactly the roots of the original polynomial. It may also be the case that none of the candidates is a solution; in this case the equation setting the polynomial equal to 0 has no rational solution.  If the equation lacks a constant term ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then 0 is one of the rational solutions of the equation.

In [[mathematics]], a '''reflection''' (also spelled '''reflexion''')&lt;ref&gt;"Reflexion" is an archaic spelling.[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/reflexion]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[function (mathematics)|mapping]] from a [[Euclidean space]] to itself that is an [[isometry]] with a [[hyperplane]] as a set of [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed point]]s; this set is called the [[Axis of symmetry|axis]] (in dimension 2) or [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] (in dimension 3) of reflection. The image of a figure by a reflection is its [[mirror image]] in the axis or plane of reflection. For example the mirror image of the small Latin letter '''p''' for a reflection with respect to a vertical axis would look like '''q'''. Its image by reflection in a horizontal axis would look like '''b'''. A reflection is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]]: when applied twice in succession, every point returns to its original location, and every geometrical object is restored to its original state.

The term ''reflection'' is sometimes used for a larger class of mappings from a Euclidean space to itself, namely the non-identity isometries that are involutions. Such isometries have a set of fixed points (the "mirror") that is an [[affine subspace]], but is possibly smaller than a hyperplane. For instance a [[Point reflection|reflection through a point]] is an involutive isometry with just one fixed point; the image of the letter '''p''' under it
would look like a '''d'''. This operation is also known as a [[point reflection|central inversion]] {{harv|Coxeter|1969|loc=§7.2}}, and exhibits Euclidean space as a [[symmetric space]]. In a [[Euclidean vector space]], the reflection in the point situated at the origin is the same as vector negation. Other examples include reflections in a line in three-dimensional space. Typically, however, unqualified use of the term "reflection" means reflection in a [[hyperplane]]. 

A figure that does not change upon undergoing a reflection is said to have [[reflection symmetry|reflectional symmetry]].

Some mathematicians use "'''flip'''" as a synonym for "reflection".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Childs |first=Lindsay N. |year=2009 |title=A Concrete Introduction to Higher Algebra |edition=3rd |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |publication-place= |page=251 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qyDAKBr_I2YC&amp;lpg=PP251&amp;vq=flip&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q=flip&amp;f=false |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Perpendicular-construction.svg|ar12thumb|236px|Point {{mvar|Q}} is the reflection of point {{mvar|P}} through the line {{mvar|AB}}.]]

In a plane (or, respectively, 3-dimensional) geometry, to find the reflection of a point drop a [[perpendicular]] from the point to the line (plane) used for reflection, and extend it the same distance on the other side. To find the reflection of a figure, reflect each point in the figure.

To reflect point {{math|P}} through the line {{math|AB}} using [[compass and straightedge]], proceed as follows (see figure):

* Step 1 (red): construct a [[circle]] with center at {{math|P}} and some fixed radius {{math|''r''}} to create points {{math|A′}} and {{math|B′}} on the line {{math|AB}}, which will be [[equidistant]] from {{math|P}}.
* Step 2 (green): construct circles centered at {{math|A′}} and {{math|B′}} having radius {{math|''r''}}. {{math|P}} and {{math|Q}} will be the points of intersection of these two circles.

Point {{math|Q}} is then the reflection of point {{math|P}} through line {{math|AB}}.

==Properties==
[[Image:Simx2=rotOK.svg|right|thumb|A reflection across an axis followed by a reflection in a second axis not parallel to the first one results in a total motion that is a [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] around the point of intersection of the axes, by an angle twice the angle between the axes.]]

The [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] for a reflection is [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]] with [[determinant]] −1 and [[eigenvalue]]s −1, 1, 1, ..., 1. The product of two such matrices is a special orthogonal matrix that represents a rotation. Every [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]] is the result of reflecting in an even number of reflections in hyperplanes through the origin, and every [[improper rotation]] is the result of reflecting in an odd number. Thus reflections generate the [[orthogonal group]], and this result is known as the [[Cartan–Dieudonné theorem]].

Similarly the [[Euclidean group]], which consists of all isometries of Euclidean space, is generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes.  In general, a [[group (mathematics)|group]] generated by reflections in affine hyperplanes is known as a [[reflection group]]. The [[finite group]]s generated in this way are examples of [[Coxeter group]]s.

==Reflection across a line in the plane==
{{details|topic=reflection of light rays|Specular reflection#Direction of reflection}}

Reflection across a line through the origin in [[two dimensions]] can be described by the following formula
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ref}_l(v) = 2\frac{v \cdot l}{l \cdot l}l - v,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v''}} denotes the vector being reflected, {{math|''l''}} denotes any vector in the line being reflected in, and {{math|''v''·''l''}} denotes the [[dot product]] of {{math|''v''}} with {{math|''l''}}. Note the formula above can also be described as
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ref}_l(v) = 2\operatorname{Proj}_l(v) - v,&lt;/math&gt;

where the reflection of line {{math|''l''}} on {{math|''v''}} is equal to 2 times the [[vector projection|projection]] of {{math|''v''}} on line {{math|''l''}} minus {{math|''v''}}.  Reflections in a line have the eigenvalues of 1, and −1.

==Reflection through a hyperplane in ''n'' dimensions==
Given a vector {{math|''v''}} in [[Euclidean space]] {{math|ℝ&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the formula for the reflection in the [[hyperplane]] through the origin, [[orthogonal]] to {{math|''a''}}, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ref}_a(v) = v - 2\frac{v\cdot a}{a\cdot a}a,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''v'' ⋅ ''a''}} denotes the [[dot product]] of {{math|''v''}} with {{math|''a''}}. Note that the second term in the above equation is just twice the [[vector projection]] of {{math|''v''}} onto {{math|''a''}}. One can easily check that
*{{math|1=Ref&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'') = −''v''}}, if {{math|''v''}} is parallel to {{math|''a''}}, and
*{{math|1=Ref&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt;(''v'') =  ''v''}}, if {{math|''v''}} is perpendicular to {{mvar|''a''}}.

Using the [[geometric product]], the formula is

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ref}_a(v) = -\frac{a v a}{a^2} .&lt;/math&gt;

Since these reflections are isometries of Euclidean space fixing the origin they may be represented by [[orthogonal matrices]]. The orthogonal matrix corresponding to the above reflection is the [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] whose entries are

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - 2\frac{a_i a_j}{ \left\| a \right\| ^2 },&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''δ''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Kronecker delta]].

The formula for the reflection in the affine hyperplane {{math|1=''v''⋅ ''a'' = ''c''}} not through the origin is
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Ref}_{a,c}(v) = v - 2\frac{v \cdot a - c}{a\cdot a}a.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Rotational vibrational coupling.gif|frame|right|In the absence of the spring, the particles would fly apart. However, the force exerted by the extended spring pulls the particles onto a periodic, oscillatory path.]]

'''Rotational–vibrational coupling''' occurs when the rotation [[frequency]] of an object is close to or identical to a natural internal vibration frequency. The animation on the right shows a simple example. The motion depicted in the animation is for the idealized situation that the force exerted by the [[Spring (device)|spring]] increases linearly with the distance to the center of rotation. Also, the animation depicts what would occur if there would not be any [[friction]].

In rotational-vibrational coupling there is an oscillation of the [[angular velocity]]. In pulling the circling masses closer to the center of rotation, the force exerted by the spring (a [[centripetal force]]) is doing [[Mechanical work|work]], converting stored [[strain energy]] in the spring into [[kinetic energy]] of the masses. As a consequence of that, the angular velocity increases. The force of the spring cannot pull the circling masses all the way to the center, for as the circling masses are moving closer to the center of rotation the force exerted by the spring gets weaker, and the velocity is steadily increasing. At some point the velocity has increased so much that the object starts to swing wide again, re-entering a phase of building up strain energy.

In [[helicopter]] design damping devices must be incorporated, because at specific angular velocities vibrations of the rotorblades can be reinforced by rotational-vibrational coupling, and build up catastrophically. Without the damping the vibrations will cause the rotorblades to break loose.

== Energy conversions ==
[[Image:Rotational vibrational coupling2.gif|frame|right|The motion of the circling masses mapped in a coordinate system that is rotating at a constant angular velocity]]

[[Image:Coriolis effect08.gif|frame|right|[[Harmonic oscillation]] the restoring force is proportional to the distance to the center.]]

[[File:Ellipse axis.png|256px|right]]

The animation on the right provides a clearer view on the oscillation of the angular velocity. There is a close analogy with [[harmonic oscillation]]. 

When a harmonic oscillation is at its midpoint then all the energy of the system is [[kinetic energy]]. When the harmonic oscillation is at the points furthest away from the midpoint all the energy of the system is [[potential energy]]. The energy of the system is oscillating back and forth between kinetic energy and potential energy. 

In the animation with the two circling masses there is a back and forth oscillation of kinetic energy and potential energy. When the spring is at its maximal extension then the potential energy is largest, when the angular velocity is at its maximum the kinetic energy is at largest. 

With a real spring there is friction involved. With a real spring the vibration will be damped and the final situation will be that the masses circle each other at a constant distance, with a constant tension of the spring.

== Mathematical derivation ==

This discussion applies the following simplifications: the spring itself is taken as being weightless, and the spring is taken as being a perfect spring; the restoring force increases in a linear way as the spring is stretched out. That is, the restoring force is exactly proportional to the distance to the center of rotation. A restoring force with this characteristic is called a '''harmonic force'''.

The following parametric equation of the position as a function of time describes the motion of the circling masses:

:&lt;math&gt; x = a \cos(\omega t) &lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt; y = b \sin(\omega t) &lt;/math&gt; (2)

:Notation:
:&lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; is half the length of the major axis 
:&lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt; is half the length of the minor axis
:&lt;math&gt; \omega &lt;/math&gt; is 360 ° divided by the duration of one revolution 

The motion as a function of time can be also be seen as a vector combination of two uniform circular motions. The parametric equations (1) and (2) can be rewritten as:

[[Image:Circle epicircle.gif|frame|right|Motion due to a harmonic force described as circle + epi-circle motion]]

:&lt;math&gt; x =\left(\begin{matrix}\frac{a+b}{2}\end{matrix}\right)\cos(\omega t) + \left(\begin{matrix}\frac{a-b}{2}\end{matrix}\right)\cos(\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y =\left(\begin{matrix}\frac{a+b}{2}\end{matrix}\right)\sin(\omega t) - \left(\begin{matrix}\frac{a-b}{2}\end{matrix}\right)\sin(\omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

A transformation to a coordinate system that subtracts the overall circular motion leaves the ''eccentricity'' of the ellipse-shaped trajectory. the center of the eccentricity is located at a distance of &lt;math&gt; (a+b)/2 &lt;/math&gt; from the main center:
:&lt;math&gt; x =   \left(\begin{matrix}\frac{a-b}{2}\end{matrix}\right)\cos (2 \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; y = - \left(\begin{matrix}\frac{a-b}{2}\end{matrix}\right)\sin (2 \omega t) &lt;/math&gt;

That is in fact what is seen in the second animation, in which the motion is mapped to a coordinate system that is rotating at a constant angular velocity. The angular velocity of the motion with respect to the rotating coordinate system is 2ω, twice the angular velocity of the overall motion. 
The spring is continuously doing work. More precisely, the spring is oscillating between doing positive work (increasing the weight's kinetic energy) and doing negative work (decreasing the weight's kinetic energy)

=== Discussion using vector notation ===
The centripetal force is a harmonic force. 

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = -\ C \vec{r} &lt;/math&gt;

The set of all solutions to the above equation of motion consists of both circular trajectories and ellipse-shaped trajectories. All the solutions have the same period of revolution. This is a distinctive feature of motion under the influence of a harmonic force; all trajectories take the same amount of time to complete a revolution.

When a rotating coordinate system is used the centrifugal term and the coriolis term are added to the equation of motion. The following equation gives the acceleration with respect to a rotating system of an object in inertial motion. 

:&lt;math&gt; a \ = \ \Omega^2 \vec{r} \ + \ 2 (\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{v}) &lt;/math&gt;

Here, '''Ω''' is the angular velocity of the rotating coordinate system with respect to the inertial coordinate system. ''v'' is velocity of the moving object with respect to the rotating coordinate system. It is important to note that the centrifugal term is determined by the angular velocity of the rotating coordinate system; the centrifugal term does not relate to the motion of the object. 

In all, this gives the following three terms in the equation of motion for motion with respect to a coordinate system rotating with angular velocity '''Ω'''.

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = -\ C \vec{r} +  m \Omega^2 \vec{r} + 2 m (\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{v}) &lt;/math&gt;

Both the centripetal force and the centrifugal term in the equation of motion are proportional to ''r''. The angular velocity of the rotating coordinate system is adjusted to have the same period of revolution as the object following an ellipse-shaped trajectory. Hence the vector of the centripetal force and the vector of the centrifugal term are at every distance to the center equal to each other in magnitude and opposite in direction, so those two terms drop away against each other. &lt;br/&gt;
It is only in very special circumstances that the vector of the centripetal force and the centrifugal term drop away against each other at every distance to the center of rotation. This is the case if and only if the centripetal force is a harmonic force. &lt;br/&gt;
In this case, only the coriolis term remains in the equation of motion.

:&lt;math&gt; \vec{F} = 2 m (\vec{\Omega} \times \vec{v}) &lt;/math&gt;

Since the vector of the coriolis term always points perpendicular to the velocity with respect to the rotating coordinate system, it follows that in the case of a restoring force that is a harmonic force, the eccentricity in the trajectory will show up as a small circular motion with respect to the rotating coordinate system. The factor 2 of the coriolis term corresponds to a period of revolution that is half the period of the overall motion.

As expected, the analysis using vector notation results in a straight confirmation of the previous analysis: &lt;br/&gt;
The spring is continuously doing work. More precisely, the spring is oscillating between doing positive work (increasing the weight's kinetic energy) and doing negative work (decreasing the weight's kinetic energy).

== Conservation of angular momentum ==
In the section 'Energy conversions in rotational-vibrational coupling' the dynamics is followed by keeping track of the energy conversions. It is often pointed out in textbooks that the increase of angular velocity on contraction is in accordance with the principle of [[Angular_momentum#Conservation_of_angular_momentum|conservation of angular momentum]]. Since there is no [[torque]] acting on the circling weights, angular momentum is conserved. However, this disregards the causal mechanism, which is the force of the extended spring, and the work done during its contraction and extension.
Similarly, when a cannon is fired, the projectile will shoot out of the barrel towards the target, and the barrel will recoil, in accordance with the principle of conservation of [[momentum]]. This does not mean that the projectile leaves the barrel at high velocity ''because'' the barrel recoils. While recoil of the barrel must occur, as described by [[Newton's third law]], it is not a causal agent. 

The causal mechanism is in the energy conversions: the explosion of the gunpowder converts potential chemical energy to the potential energy of a highly compressed gas. As the gas expands, its high pressure exerts a force on both the projectile and the interior of the barrel. It is through the action of that force that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy of both projectile and barrel.

In the case of rotational-vibrational coupling, the causal agent is the force exerted by the spring. The spring is oscillating between doing work and doing negative work. (The work is taken to be negative when the direction of the force is opposite to the direction of the motion.)

In [[mathematics]], '''Schwartz space''' is the [[function space]] of all functions whose derivatives are rapidly decreasing (defined rigorously below).  This space has the important property that the [[Fourier transform]] is an [[automorphism]] on this space. This property enables one, by duality, to define the Fourier transform for elements in the dual space of ''S'', that is, for [[tempered distributions]].  The Schwartz space was named in honour of [[Laurent Schwartz]] by [[Alexander Grothendieck]].&lt;ref&gt;Terzioğlu, T. (1969). On Schwartz spaces. Mathematische Annalen, 182(3), 236–242.&lt;/ref&gt;  A function in the Schwartz space is sometimes called a '''Schwartz function'''.
[[File:Gaussian 2D.png|right|thumb|250px|A two-dimensional [[Gaussian function]] is an example of a rapidly decreasing function.]]

==Definition==
The Schwartz space or '''space of rapidly decreasing functions on''' '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the function space

:&lt;math&gt;S \left(\mathbf{R}^n\right) = \left \{ f \in C^\infty(\mathbf{R}^n) :  \|f\|_{\alpha,\beta} &lt; \infty\quad \forall \alpha, \beta \in\mathbb{N}^n\right \}, &lt;/math&gt;

where α, β are [[multi-index|multi-indices]], C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) is the set of smooth functions from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; to '''C''', and

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{\alpha,\beta}=\sup_{x\in\mathbf{R}^n} \left |x^\alpha D^\beta f(x) \right |.&lt;/math&gt;

Here, sup denotes the [[supremum]], and we again use [[multi-index notation]].

To put common language to this definition, one could consider a rapidly decreasing function as essentially a function ''f''(''x'') such that ''f''(''x''), ''f''′(''x''), ''f''′′(''x''), ... all exist everywhere on '''R''' and go to zero as ''x'' → ±∞ faster than any inverse power of ''x''. In particular, ''S''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) is a subspace of the [[function space]] ''C''&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) of infinitely differentiable functions.

==Examples of functions in the Schwartz space==
* If ''i'' is a multi-index, and ''a'' is a positive real number, then

::&lt;math&gt;x^i e^{-a |x|^2} \in S(\mathbf{R}^n).&lt;/math&gt;

* Any smooth function ''f'' with [[compact support]] is in ''S''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;). This is clear since any derivative of ''f'' is continuous and supported in the support of ''f'', so (''x''&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;''D''&lt;sup&gt;β&lt;/sup&gt;) ''f'' has a maximum in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; by the [[extreme value theorem]].

==Properties==
* ''S''('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) is a [[Fréchet space]] over the complex numbers.

The '''singularity spectrum''' is a function used in [[Multifractal analysis]] to describe the fractal dimension of a subset of points of a function belonging to a group of points that have the same [[Hölder exponent]].  Intuitively, the singularity spectrum gives a value for how "fractal" a set of points are in a function.

More formally, the singularity spectrum &lt;math&gt;D(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; of a function, &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;D(\alpha) = D_F\{x, \alpha(x) = \alpha\}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the function describing the [[Holder exponent]], &lt;math&gt;\alpha(x)&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; at the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;D_F\{\cdot\}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Hausdorff dimension]] of a point set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3116">In [[combinatorics]], '''Sun's curious identity''' is the following [[Identity (mathematics)|identity]] involving [[binomial coefficient]]s, first established by [[Zhi-Wei Sun]] in 2002:

:&lt;math&gt;
(x+m+1)\sum_{i=0}^m(-1)^i\dbinom{x+y+i}{m-i}\dbinom{y+2i}{i}
-\sum_{i=0}^{m}\dbinom{x+i}{m-i}(-4)^i=(x-m)\dbinom{x}{m}.
&lt;/math&gt;

== Proofs ==
After Sun's publication of this identity, five other proofs were obtained by various mathematicians: 

* Panholzer and Prodinger's proof via [[generating functions]]; 
* Merlini and Sprugnoli's proof using [[Riordan arrays]]; 
* Ekhad and Mohammed's proof by the [[WZ theory|WZ]] method; 
* Chu and Claudio's proof with the help of [[Johan Jensen (mathematician)|Jensen]]'s formula; 
* Callan's [[combinatorial proof]] involving [[dominos]] and colorings.

In physics, the '''supersymmetric WKB (SWKB) approximation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Fred|last2=Khare|first2=Avinash|last3=Sukhatme|first3=Uday|title=Supersymmetry and Quantum Mechanics|journal=Physics Reports|date=1995|volume=251|pages=267–385|doi=10.1016/0370-1573(94)00080-m|arxiv=hep-th/9405029|bibcode=1995PhR...251..267C}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the [[WKB approximation]] that uses principles from [[supersymmetric quantum mechanics]] to provide estimations on [[energy eigenvalue]]s in [[quantum-mechanical]] systems. Using the supersymmetric method, there are potentials &lt;math&gt;V(x)&lt;/math&gt; that can be expressed in terms of a superpotential, &lt;math&gt;W(x)&lt;/math&gt;, such that

:&lt;math&gt; V(x) = W^2(x)-\frac{\hbar}{\sqrt{2m}} W'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The SWKB approximation then writes the Born–Sommerfeld quantization condition from the WKB approximation in terms of &lt;math&gt;W(x)&lt;/math&gt;.

The SWKB approximation for unbroken supersymmetry, to first order in &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\hbar}\int_b^a dx \, \sqrt{2m(E_n-W^2(x))} = n\pi&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is the estimate of the energy of the &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;-th excited state, and &lt;math&gt; a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are the classical turning points, given by

:&lt;math&gt; W^2(a) = W^2(b) = E_n&lt;/math&gt;

The addition of the supersymmetric method provides several appealing qualities to this method. First, it is known that, by construction, the ground state energy will be exactly estimated. This is an improvement over the standard WKB approximation, which often has weaknesses at lower energies. Another property is that a class of potentials known as shape invariant potentials have their energy spectra estimated exactly by this first-order condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13450">In [[computer science]], the '''test-and-set''' instruction is an instruction used to write 1 (set) to a memory location and return its old value as a single [[atomic (computer science)|atomic]] (i.e., non-interruptible) operation. If multiple processes may access the same memory location, and if a process is currently performing a test-and-set, no other process may begin another test-and-set until the first process's test-and-set is finished.  A [[Central processing unit|CPU]] may use a test-and-set instruction offered by another electronic component, such as [[DPRAM|dual-port RAM]]; a CPU itself may also offer a test-and-set instruction.

A lock can be built using an atomic test-and-set&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=T. E.|date=1990-01-01|title=The performance of spin lock alternatives for shared-money multiprocessors|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org:80/document/80120/?reload=true|journal=IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems|volume=1|issue=1|pages=6–16|doi=10.1109/71.80120|issn=1045-9219}}&lt;/ref&gt; instruction as follows:&lt;pre&gt;
function Lock(boolean *lock) { 
    while (test_and_set(lock) == 1); 
}
&lt;/pre&gt;The calling process obtains the lock if the old value was 0 otherwise while-loop spins waiting to acquire the lock. This is called a [[spinlock]]. "[[Test and test-and-set|Test and Test-and-set]]" is another example.

[[Maurice Herlihy]] (1991) proved that test-and-set has a finite [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus number]] and can solve the wait-free [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus problem]] for at-most two concurrent processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Herlihy|first=Maurice|date=January 1991|title=Wait-free synchronization|url=http://www.cs.brown.edu/~mph/Herlihy91/p124-herlihy.pdf|journal=ACM Trans. Program. Lang. Syst.|volume=13|issue=1|pages=124–149|doi=10.1145/114005.102808|accessdate=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[compare-and-swap]] offers a more general solution to this problem.

== Hardware implementation of test-and-set ==
[[DPRAM]] test-and-set instructions can work in many ways.  Here are two variations, both of which describe a DPRAM which provides exactly 2 ports, allowing 2 separate electronic components (such as 2 CPUs) access to every memory location on the DPRAM.

=== Variation 1 ===
When CPU 1 issues a test-and-set instruction, the DPRAM first makes an "internal note" of this by storing the address of the memory location in a special place.  If at this point, CPU 2 happens to issue a test-and-set instruction for the same memory location, the DPRAM first checks its "internal note", recognizes the situation, and issues a BUSY interrupt, which tells CPU 2 that it must wait and retry.  This is an implementation of a [[busy waiting]] or [[spinlock]] using the interrupt mechanism.  Since all this happens at hardware speeds, CPU 2's wait to get out of the spin-lock is very short.

Whether or not CPU 2 was trying to access the memory location, the DPRAM performs the test given by CPU 1.  If the test succeeds, the DPRAM sets the memory location to the value given by CPU 1.  Then the DPRAM wipes out its "internal note" that CPU 1 was writing there.  At this point, CPU 2 could issue a test-and-set, which would succeed.

=== Variation 2 ===
CPU 1 issues a test-and-set instruction to write to "memory location A".  The DPRAM does not immediately store the value in memory location A, but instead simultaneously moves the current value to a special register, while setting the contents of memory location A to a special "flag value".  If at this point, CPU 2 issues a test-and-set to memory location A, the DPRAM detects the special flag value, and as in Variation 1, issues a BUSY interrupt.

Whether or not CPU 2 was trying to access the memory location, the DPRAM now performs CPU 1's test.  If the test succeeds, the DPRAM sets memory location A to the value specified by CPU 1.  If the test fails, the DPRAM copies the value back from the special register to memory location A.  Either operation wipes out the special flag value.  If CPU 2 now issues a test-and-set, it will succeed.

== Software implementation of test-and-set ==
Some instruction sets have an atomic test-and-set machine language instruction. Examples include [[x86]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/BTS.html|title=BTS—Bit Test and Set|website=www.felixcloutier.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[IBM System/360]] and its successors (including [[z/Architecture]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB23S_1.1.0.13/gtpc3/tasinst.html|title=IBM Knowledge Center|website=www.ibm.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Those that do not can still implement an atomic test-and-set using a [[read-modify-write]] or [[compare-and-swap]] instruction.

The test and set instruction, when used with boolean values, uses logic like that shown in the following function, except that the function must execute [[atomic (computer science)|atomically]]. That is, no other process must be able to interrupt the function mid-execution, thereby seeing a state that only exists while the function executes. That requires hardware support; it cannot be implemented as shown. Nevertheless, the code shown helps to explain the behaviour of test-and-set.  NOTE: In this example, 'lock' is assumed to be passed by reference (or by name) but the assignment to 'initial' creates a new value (not just copying a reference).

 function TestAndSet(boolean_ref lock) {
     boolean initial = lock;
     lock = true;
     return initial;
 }

Not only is the code shown not atomic, in the sense of the test-and-set instruction, it also differs from the descriptions of DPRAM hardware test-and-set above. Here, the value being set and the test are fixed and invariant, and the value is updated regardless of the outcome of the test, whereas for the DPRAM test-and-set, the memory is set only when the test succeeds, and the value to set and the test condition are specified by the CPU.  Here, the value to set can only be 1, but if 0 and 1 are considered the only valid values for the memory location, and "value is nonzero" is the only allowed test, then this equates to the case described for DPRAM hardware (or, more specifically, the DPRAM case reduces to this under these constraints).  From that viewpoint, this can, correctly, be called "test-and-set" in the full, conventional sense of that term.  The essential point to note is the general intent and principle of test-and-set: a value is both tested and set in one atomic operation such that no other program thread or process can change the target memory location after it is tested but before it is set. (This is because the location must only be set if it currently has a certain value, not if it had that value sometime earlier.)

In the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], the implementation would be like:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="c"&gt;
 #define LOCKED 1

int TestAndSet(int* lockPtr) {
    int oldValue;
     
    // -- Start of atomic segment --
    // This should be interpreted as pseudocode for illustrative purposes only.
    // Traditional compilation of this code will not guarantee atomicity, the
    // use of shared memory (i.e., non-cached values), protection from compiler
    // optimizations, or other required properties.
    oldValue = *lockPtr;
    *lockPtr = LOCKED;
    // -- End of atomic segment --

    return oldValue;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The code also shows that there are really two operations: an atomic read-modify-write and a test. Only the read-modify-write needs to be atomic.  (This is true because delaying the value comparison by any amount of time will not change the result of the test once the value to test has been obtained.  Once the code writes the initial value, the result of the test has been established, even if it has not been computed yet — e.g., by the == operator.)

== Mutual exclusion using test-and-set ==
One way to implement [[mutual exclusion]] is by using a test-and-set based lock&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces|last=Remzi H. Arpaci-Dusseau and Andrea C. Arpaci-Dusseau|first=|publisher=Arpaci-Dusseau Books|year=2015|isbn=|edition=0.91|location=|pages=|quote=|via=http://www.ostep.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of parallel computer architecture : multichip and multicore systems|last=Solihin|first=Yan|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=9780984163007|location=|pages=252|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

=== pseudo-C implementation ===
&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
 volatile int lock = 0;
 
 void Critical() {
     while (TestAndSet(&amp;lock) == 1);
     critical section // only one process can be in this section at a time
     lock = 0 // release lock when finished with the critical section
 }
&lt;/source&gt;
The lock variable is a shared variable i.e. it can be accessed by all processors/threads. Note the ''[[Volatile variable|volatile]]'' keyword. In absence of volatile, the compiler and/or the CPU(s) may optimize access to lock and/or use cached values, thus rendering the above code erroneous. Conversely, and unfortunately, the presence of ''volatile'' does ''not'' guarantee that reads and writes are committed to memory. Some compilers issue [[memory barrier]]s to ensure that operations are committed to memory, but since the semantics of ''volatile'' in C/C++ is quite vague, not all compilers will do that. Consult your compiler's documentation to determine if it does.

This function can be called by multiple processes, but it is guaranteed that only one process will be in the [[critical section]] at a time. The rest of the processes will keep spinning until they get the lock. It is possible that a process is never granted the lock. In such a case it will loop endlessly. This is a drawback of this implementation as it doesn't ensure fairness. These issues are further elaborated in the [[Test-and-set#Performance Issues with test-and-set locks|performance section]].

===  Assembly implementation ===
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="nasm"&gt;
enter_region:        ; A "jump to" tag; function entry point.

  tsl reg, flag      ; Test and Set Lock; flag is the
                     ; shared variable; it is copied
                     ; into the register reg and flag
                     ; then atomically set to 1.

  cmp reg, #0        ; Was flag zero on entry_region?

  jnz enter_region   ; Jump to enter_region if
                     ; reg is non-zero; i.e.,
                     ; flag was non-zero on entry.

  ret                ; Exit; i.e., flag was zero on
                     ; entry. If we get here, tsl
                     ; will have set it non-zero; thus,
                     ; we have claimed the resource
                     ; associated with flag.

leave_region:
  move flag, #0      ; store 0 in flag
  ret                ; return to caller
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Here &lt;code&gt;tsl&lt;/code&gt; is an atomic instruction and &lt;code&gt;flag&lt;/code&gt; is the lock variable. The process doesn't return unless it acquires the lock.

==Performance evaluation of test-and-set locks==

The four major evaluation metrics for locks in general are uncontended lock-acquisition latency, bus traffic, fairness, and storage.&lt;ref name="Solihin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Solihin|first1=Yan|title=Fundamentals of Parallel Architecture|date=2016|publisher=CRC Press|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=978-1-4822-1118-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Test-and-set scores low on two of them, namely, high bus traffic and unfairness.

When processor P1 has obtained a lock and processor P2 is also waiting for the lock, P2 will keep incurring bus transactions in attempts to acquire the lock. When a processor has obtained a lock, all other processors which also wish to obtain the same lock keep trying to obtain the lock by initiating bus transactions repeatedly until they get hold of the lock. This increases the bus traffic requirement of test-and-set significantly. This slows down all other traffic from [[Cache (computing)|cache]] and [[Cache coherence|coherence]] misses. It slows down the overall section, since the traffic is saturated by failed lock acquisition attempts. [[Test and test-and-set|Test-and-test-and-set]] is an improvement over TSL since it does not initiate lock acquisition requests continuously.

When we consider fairness, we consider if a processor gets a fair chance of acquiring the lock when it is set free. In an extreme situation the processor might starve i.e. it might not be able to acquire the lock for an extended period of time even though it has become free during that time.

Storage overhead for TSL is next to nothing since only one lock is required. Uncontended latency is also low since only one atomic instruction and branch are needed.

A '''triangular number''' or '''triangle number''' counts objects arranged in an [[equilateral triangle]], as in the diagram on the right. The {{math|''n''}}th triangular number is the number of dots in the triangular arrangement with {{math|''n''}} dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the {{math|''n''}} [[natural number]]s from 1 to {{math|''n''}}. The sequence of triangular numbers {{OEIS|id=A000217}}, starting at the [[empty sum|0th triangular number]], is
:0, 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, 66, 78, 91, 105, 120, 136, 153, 171, 190, 210, 231, 253, 276, 300, 325, 351, 378, 406, 435, 465, 496, 528, 561, 595, 630, 666...

==Formula==
{{Pascal_triangle_simplex_numbers.svg||triangular numbers}}
The triangle numbers are given by the following explicit formulas:
:&lt;!-- THE END OF THE NEXT LINE HAS BINOMIAL NOTATION. PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE IF YOU ARE UNFAMILIAR. --&gt;&lt;math&gt; T_n= \sum_{k=1}^n k = 1+2+3+ \dotsb +n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = {n+1 \choose 2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {n+1 \choose 2}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[binomial coefficient]]. It represents the number of distinct pairs that can be selected from {{math|''n'' + 1}} objects, and it is read aloud as "{{math|''n''}} plus one choose two".

The first equation can be illustrated using a [[proof without words|visual proof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/triangular-numbers.html|title=Triangular Number Sequence|website=Math Is Fun}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every triangular number &lt;math&gt;T_n&lt;/math&gt;, imagine a "half-square" arrangement of objects corresponding to the triangular number, as in the figure below.  Copying this arrangement and rotating it to create a rectangular figure doubles the number of objects, producing a rectangle with dimensions &lt;math&gt;n \times (n+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which is also the number of objects in the rectangle.  Clearly, the triangular number itself is always exactly half of the number of objects in such a figure, or: &lt;math&gt;T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;.  The example &lt;math&gt;T_4&lt;/math&gt; follows:

{|cellpadding="7"
|&lt;math&gt; 2T_4 = 4(4+1) = 20 &lt;/math&gt; (green plus yellow) implies that &lt;math&gt;T_4 = \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = 10 &lt;/math&gt; (green).
|[[File:Illustration of Triangular Number T 4 Leading to a Rectangle.png]]
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}

The first equation can also be established using [[mathematical induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, George E.  ''Number Theory'', Dover, New York, 1971. pp. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the sum of the first (one) natural number(s) is clearly equal to one, a basis case is established.  Assuming the inductive hypothesis for some &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and adding &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; to both sides immediately gives

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^{n} k + (n+1) = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} + (n+1) \rightarrow \sum_{k=1}^{n+1} k = \frac{(n+1)((n+1)+1)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, since the [[proposition]] &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the first equation, or inductive hypothesis itself) is true when &lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; being true implies that &lt;math&gt;P(n+1)&lt;/math&gt; is also true, then the first equation is true for all natural numbers.  The above argument can be easily modified to start with, and include, zero.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] is said to have found this relationship in his early youth, by multiplying {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}} pairs of numbers in the sum by the values of each pair {{math|''n'' + 1}}.&lt;ref name=Gauss&gt;{{cite web|last=Hayes|first=Brian|title=Gauss's Day of Reckoning|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/gausss-day-of-reckoning/1|work=American Scientist|publisher=Computing Science|accessdate=2014-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of the truth of this story, Gauss was not the first to discover this formula, and some find it likely that its origin goes back to the [[Pythagoreans]] 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eves|first1=Howard|title=Webpage cites AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS|url=http://mathcentral.uregina.ca/QQ/database/QQ.09.98/matt1.html|publisher=Mathcentral|accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two formulae were described by the Irish monk [[Dicuil]] in about 816 in his [[Computus]].&lt;ref&gt;Esposito,M. An unpublished astronomical treatise by the Irish monk Dicuil. Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, XXXVI C. Dublin, 1907, 378-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The triangular number {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} solves the '''handshake problem''' of counting the number of handshakes if each person in a room with {{math|''n'' + 1}} people shakes hands once with each person. In other words, the solution to the handshake problem of {{math|''n''}} people is {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathcircles.org/node/835&lt;/ref&gt; The function {{math|''T''}} is the additive analog of the [[factorial]] function, which is the ''products'' of integers from 1 to&amp;nbsp;{{math|''n''}}.

The number of line segments between closest pairs of dots in the triangle can be represented in terms of the number of dots or with a [[recurrence relation]]:
:&lt;math&gt;L_n = 3 T_{n-1}= 3{n \choose 2};~~~L_n = L_{n-1} + 3(n-1), ~L_1 = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit, the ratio between the two numbers, dots and line segments is
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{T_n}{L_n} = \frac{1}{3}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Relations to other figurate numbers==
Triangular numbers have a wide variety of relations to other [[figurate number]]s.

Most simply, the sum of two consecutive triangular numbers is a [[square number]], with the sum being the square of the difference between the two (and thus the difference of the two being the square root of the sum). Algebraically,
:&lt;math&gt;T_n + T_{n-1} = \left (\frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{\left(n-1\right)^2}{2} + \frac{n-1}{2} \right ) = \left (\frac{n^2}{2} + \frac{n}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{n^2}{2} - \frac{n}{2} \right ) = n^2 = (T_n - T_{n-1})^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the same fact can be demonstrated graphically:
{| cellpadding="7"
|6 + 10 = 16
|[[File:Square number 16 as sum of two triangular numbers.svg]]
|&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|10 + 15 = 25
|[[File:Square number 25 as sum of two triangular numbers.svg]]
|}

There are infinitely many triangular numbers that are also square numbers; e.g., 1, 36, 1225. Some of them can be generated by a simple recursive formula:
:&lt;math&gt;S_{n+1} = 4S_n \left( 8S_n + 1\right)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

''All'' [[square triangular number]]s are found from the recursion
:&lt;math&gt;S_n = 34S_{n-1} - S_{n-2} + 2&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;S_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_1 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Nicomachus_theorem_3D.svg|thumb|A square whose side length is a triangular number can be partitioned into squares and half-squares whose areas add to cubes. This shows that the square of the {{math|''n''}}th triangular number is equal to the sum of the first {{math|''n''}} [[Cube (algebra)|cube numbers]].]]

Also, the [[squared triangular number|square of the {{math|''n''}}th triangular number]] is the same as the sum of the cubes of the integers 1 to {{math|''n''}}. This can also be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{k=1}^n k^3 = \left(\sum_{k=1}^n k \right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The sum of the all triangular numbers up to the {{math|''n''}}th triangular number is the {{math|''n''}}th [[tetrahedral number]],
:&lt;math&gt; \frac {n(n+1)(n+2)} {6}.&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, the difference between the {{math|''n''}}th [[polygonal number|{{math|''m''}}-gonal number]] and the {{math|''n''}}th {{math|(''m'' + 1)}}-gonal number is the {{math|(''n'' − 1)}}th triangular number. For example, the sixth [[heptagonal number]] (81) minus the sixth [[hexagonal number]] (66) equals the fifth triangular number, 15. Every other triangular number is a hexagonal number. Knowing the triangular numbers, one can reckon any [[centered polygonal number]]; the {{math|''n''}}th centered {{math|''k''}}-gonal number is obtained by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;Ck_n = kT_{n-1}+1&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''T''}} is a triangular number.

The positive difference of two triangular numbers is a [[trapezoidal number]].

==Other properties==
Triangular numbers correspond to the first-degree case of [[Faulhaber's formula]].

Alternating triangular numbers (1, 6, 15, 28, ...) are also [[hexagonal number]]s.

Every even [[perfect number]] is triangular (as well as hexagonal), given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;M_p 2^{p-1} = \frac{M_p (M_p + 1)}2 = T_{M_p}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a [[Mersenne prime]]. No odd perfect numbers are known, hence all known perfect numbers are triangular.

For example, the third triangular number is (3 × 2 =) 6, the seventh is (7 × 4 =) 28, the 31st is (31 × 16 =) 496, and the 127th is (127 × 64 =) 8128.

In [[base 10]], the [[digital root]] of a nonzero triangular number is always 1, 3, 6, or 9. Hence every triangular number is either divisible by three or has a remainder of 1 when divided by 9:
:0 = 9 × 0
:1 = 9 × 0 + 1
:3 = 9 × 0 + 3
:6 = 9 × 0 + 6
:10 = 9 × 1 + 1
:15 = 9 × 1 + 6
:21 = 9 × 2 + 3
:28 = 9 × 3 + 1
:36 = 9 × 4
:45 = 9 × 5
:55 = 9 × 6 + 1
:66 = 9 × 7 + 3
:78 = 9 × 8 + 6
:91 = 9 × 10 + 1
:…
:There is a more specific property to the triangular numbers that aren't divisible by 3, that is, they either have a remainder 1 when divided by 27, or a remainder 10 when divided by 81
The digital root pattern for triangular numbers, repeating every nine terms, as shown above, is "1, 3, 6, 1, 6, 3, 1, 9, 9".

The converse of the statement above is, however, not always true. For example, the digital root of 12, which is not a triangular number, is 3 and divisible by three.

If {{math|''x''}} is a triangular number, then {{math|''ax'' + ''b''}} is also a triangular number, given {{math|''a''}} is an odd square and {{math|''b'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''a'' − 1|8}}}}

{{math|''b''}} will always be a triangular number, because {{math|1=8''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 = (2''n'' + 1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which yields all the odd squares are revealed by multiplying a triangular number by 8 and adding 1, and the process for {{math|''b''}} given {{math|''a''}} is an odd square is the inverse of this operation.

The first several pairs of this form (not counting {{math|1''x'' + 0}}) are: {{math|9''x'' + 1}}, {{math|25''x'' + 3}}, {{math|49''x'' + 6}}, {{math|81''x'' + 10}}, {{math|121''x'' + 15}}, {{math|169''x'' + 21}}, … etc. Given {{math|''x''}} is equal to {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, these formulas yield {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;3''n'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;5''n'' + 2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;7''n'' + 3&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;9''n'' + 4&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and so on.

The sum of the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocals]] of all the nonzero triangular numbers is
:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{1 \over {{n^2 + n} \over 2}} = 2\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{1 \over {n^2 + n}} = 2 .&lt;/math&gt;

This can be shown by using the basic sum of a [[telescoping series]]:
:&lt;math&gt; \!\ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{1 \over {n(n+1)}} = 1 .&lt;/math&gt;

Two other interesting formulas regarding triangular numbers are
:&lt;math&gt;T_{a+b} = T_a + T_b + ab&lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;T_{ab} = T_aT_b + T_{a-1}T_{b-1},&lt;/math&gt;
both of which can easily be established either by looking at dot patterns (see above) or with some simple algebra.

In 1796, German mathematician and scientist [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] discovered that every positive integer is representable as a sum of three triangular numbers (possibly including {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} = 0), writing in his diary his famous words, "[[Eureka (word)|ΕΥΡΗΚΑ!]] {{nowrap|1=num = Δ + Δ + Δ}}". Note that this theorem does not imply that the triangular numbers are different (as in the case of 20 = 10 + 10 + 0), nor that a solution with exactly three nonzero triangular numbers must exist. This is a special case of the [[Fermat polygonal number theorem]].

The largest triangular number of the form {{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1}} is [[4000 (number)#4001 to 4099|4095]] (see [[Ramanujan–Nagell equation]]).

[[Wacław Sierpiński|Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński]] posed the question as to the existence of four distinct triangular numbers in [[geometric progression]]. It was conjectured by Polish mathematician [[Kazimierz Szymiczek]] to be impossible. This conjecture was proven by Fang and Chen in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emis.de/journals/INTEGERS/papers/h19/h19.pdf Chen, Fang: Triangular numbers in geometric progression]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emis.de/journals/INTEGERS/papers/h57/h57.pdf Fang: Nonexistence of a geometric progression that contains four triangular numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

Formulas involving expressing an integer as the sum of triangular numbers are connected to [[theta function]]s, in particular the [[Ramanujan theta function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Zhi-Guo|date=2003-12-01|title=An Identity of Ramanujan and the Representation of Integers as Sums of Triangular Numbers|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:RAMA.0000012425.42327.ae|journal=The Ramanujan Journal|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=407–434|doi=10.1023/B:RAMA.0000012425.42327.ae|issn=1382-4090}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Sun|first=Zhi-Hong|date=2016-01-24|title=Ramanujan's theta functions and sums of triangular numbers|eprint=1601.06378|class=math.NT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A [[fully connected network]] of {{math|''n''}} computing devices requires the presence of {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}} cables or other connections; this is equivalent to the handshake problem mentioned above.

In a tournament format that uses a round-robin [[group stage]], the number of matches that need to be played between {{math|''n''}} teams is equal to the triangular number {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n'' − 1&lt;/sub&gt;}}. For example, a group stage with 4 teams requires 6 matches, and a group stage with 8 teams requires 28 matches. This is also equivalent to the handshake problem and fully connected network problems.

One way of calculating the [[depreciation]] of an asset is the [[depreciation#Sum-of-years-digits method|sum-of-years' digits method]], which involves finding {{math|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|''n''}} is the length in years of the asset's useful life. Each year, the item loses {{math|(''b'' − ''s'') × {{sfrac|''n'' − ''y''|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}}}, where {{math|''b''}} is the item's beginning value (in units of currency), {{math|''s''}} is its final salvage value, {{math|''n''}} is the total number of years the item is usable, and {{math|''y''}} the current year in the depreciation schedule. Under this method, an item with a usable life of {{math|''n''}} = 4 years would lose {{sfrac|4|10}} of its "losable" value in the first year, {{sfrac|3|10}} in the second, {{sfrac|2|10}} in the third, and {{sfrac|1|10}} in the fourth, accumulating a total depreciation of {{sfrac|10|10}} (the whole) of the losable value.

==Triangular roots and tests for triangular numbers{{Anchor|Triangular root}}==
By analogy with the [[square root]] of {{mvar|x}}, one can define the (positive) triangular root of {{mvar|x}} as the number {{math|''n''}} such that {{math|1=''T''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''}}:&lt;ref name="EulerRoots"&gt;{{Citation |last=Euler |first=Leonhard |authorlink=Leonhard Euler |last2=Lagrange |first2=Joseph Louis |author2-link=Joseph Louis Lagrange |year=1810 |title=[[Elements of Algebra]] |edition=2nd |volume=1 |publisher=J. Johnson and Co. |pages=332–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{\sqrt{8x+1}-1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

which follows immediately from the [[quadratic formula]]. So an integer {{mvar|x}} is triangular if and only if {{math|8''x'' + 1}} is a square. Equivalently, if the positive triangular root {{mvar|n}} of {{mvar|x}} is an integer, then {{mvar|x}} is the {{mvar|n}}th triangular number.&lt;ref name="EulerRoots" /&gt;

'''''Weapons of Math Destruction''''' is a 2016 American book about the societal impact of [[algorithm]]s, written by [[Cathy O'Neil]]. It explores how some big data algorithms are increasingly used in ways that reinforce preexisting inequality. It was longlisted for the 2016 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name="nationalbook"&gt;{{citation|url=http://nationalbook.org/nba2016_nf_oneil-weapons-of-math-destruction.html|publisher=[[National Book Foundation]]|title=2016 National Book Award Longlist, Nonfiction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-national-book-awards-nonfiction-longlist|work=[[The New Yorker]]|title=The National Book Awards Longlist: Nonfiction|date=September 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[CNN]]|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/06/technology/weapons-of-math-destruction/|title=Math is racist: How data is driving inequality|author=Rawlins, Aimee|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
O'Neil, a mathematician, analyses how the use of big data and [[algorithm]]s in a variety of fields, including insurance, advertising, education, and policing, can lead to decisions that harm the poor, reinforce [[racism]], and amplify inequality. According to [[National Book Foundation]]&lt;ref name="nationalbook" /&gt;:

{{Quote
|text=Most troubling, they reinforce discrimination: If a poor student can’t get a loan because a lending model deems him too risky (by virtue of his zip code), he’s then cut off from the kind of education that could pull him out of poverty, and a vicious spiral ensues. Models are propping up the lucky and punishing the downtrodden, creating a “toxic cocktail for democracy.”
}}

She posits that these problematic mathematical tools share three key features: they are opaque, unregulated and difficult to contest, and at the same time scalable, thereby amplifying any inherent biases to affect increasingly larger populations.

==Reception==
The book received widespread praise for elucidating the consequences of reliance on big data models for structuring socioeconomic resources. Clay Shirky from [[The New York Times Book Review]] said "O’Neil does a masterly job explaining the pervasiveness and risks of the algorithms that regulate our lives," while pointing out that "the section on solutions is weaker than the illustration of the problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cw|title=WEAPONS OF MATH DESTRUCTION How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/books/review/weapons-of-math-destruction-cathy-oneil-and-more.html|publisher=[[The New York Times Book Review]]|author=Shirky, Clay|date=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In [[mathematics]], a '''well-order''' (or '''well-ordering''' or '''well-order [[Binary_relation|relation]]''') on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is a [[total order]] on ''S'' with the property that every [[non-empty]] [[subset]] of ''S'' has a [[least element]] in this ordering. The set ''S'' together with the well-order relation is then called a '''well-ordered set'''. In some academic articles and textbooks these terms are instead written as '''wellorder''', '''wellordered''', and '''wellordering''' or '''well order''', '''well ordered''', and '''well ordering'''.

Every non-empty well-ordered set has a least element. Every element ''s'' of a well-ordered set, except a possible [[greatest element]], has a unique successor (next element), namely the least element of the subset of all elements greater than ''s''. There may be elements besides the least element which have no predecessor (see ''[[#Natural numbers|Natural numbers]]'' below for an example). In a well-ordered set ''S'', every subset ''T'' which has an upper bound has a [[Supremum|least upper bound]], namely the least element of the subset of all upper bounds of ''T'' in ''S''.

If ≤ is a [[non-strict order|non-strict]] well ordering, then &lt; is a strict well ordering. A relation is a strict well ordering if and only if it is a [[well-founded relation|well-founded]] [[strict total order]]. The distinction between strict and non-strict well orders is often ignored since they are easily interconvertible.

Every well-ordered set is uniquely [[order isomorphic]] to a unique [[ordinal number]], called the [[order type]] of the well-ordered set. The [[well-ordering theorem]], which is equivalent to the [[axiom of choice]], states that every set can be well ordered. If a set is well ordered (or even if it merely admits a [[well-founded relation]]), the proof technique of [[transfinite induction]] can be used to prove that a given statement is true for all elements of the set.

The observation that the [[natural numbers]] are well ordered by the usual less-than relation is commonly called the [[well-ordering principle]] (for natural numbers).

== Ordinal numbers ==
{{main|Ordinal number}}

Every well-ordered set is uniquely [[order isomorphic]] to a unique [[ordinal number]], called the [[order type]] of the well-ordered set. The position of each element within the ordered set is also given by an ordinal number. In the case of a finite set, the basic operation of [[counting]], to find the ordinal number of a particular object, or to find the object with a particular ordinal number, corresponds to assigning ordinal numbers one by one to the objects. The size (number of elements, [[cardinal number]]) of a finite set is equal to the order type. Counting in the everyday sense typically starts from one, so it assigns to each object the size of the initial segment with that object as last element. Note that these numbers are one more than the formal ordinal numbers according to the isomorphic order, because these are equal to the number of earlier objects (which corresponds to counting from zero). Thus for finite ''n'', the expression "''n''-th element" of a well-ordered set requires context to know whether this counts from zero or one. In a notation "&amp;beta;-th element" where β can also be an infinite ordinal, it will typically count from zero.

For an infinite set the order type determines the [[cardinality]], but not conversely: well-ordered sets of a particular cardinality can have many different order types. For a [[countably infinite]] set, the set of possible order types is even uncountable.

== Examples and counterexamples ==

=== Natural numbers ===
The standard ordering ≤ of the [[natural number]]s is a well ordering and has the additional property that every non-zero natural number has a unique predecessor.

Another well ordering of the natural numbers is given by defining that all even numbers are less than all odd numbers, and the usual ordering applies within the evens and the odds:

:0 2 4 6 8 ... 1 3 5 7 9 ...

This is a well-ordered set of order type ω&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω. Every element has a successor (there is no largest element).  Two elements lack a predecessor: 0 and 1.

=== Integers ===
Unlike the standard ordering ≤ of the [[natural number]]s, the standard ordering ≤ of the [[integer]]s is not a well ordering, since, for example, the set of [[negative number|negative]] integers does not contain a least element.

The following relation ''R'' is an example of well ordering of the integers: ''[[Binary relation|x R y]]'' [[if and only if]] one of the following conditions holds:
# ''x'' = 0
# ''x'' is positive, and ''y'' is negative
# ''x'' and ''y'' are both positive, and ''x'' ≤ ''y''
# ''x'' and ''y'' are both negative, and |''x''| ≤ |''y''|
This relation ''R'' can be visualized as follows: 
:0  1  2  3  4  ...  −1  −2  −3  ...
''R'' is isomorphic to the [[ordinal number]] ω + ω.

Another relation for well ordering the integers is the following definition: ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''y'' [[iff]] (|''x''|&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;|''y''| or (|''x''|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;|''y''| and ''x''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''y'')). This well order can be visualized as follows: 
: 0  −1  1  −2  2  −3  3  −4  4  ...

This has the [[order type]] ω.

=== Reals ===
The standard ordering ≤ of any [[Interval_(mathematics)|real interval]] is not a well ordering, since, for example, the [[open interval]] (0, 1) ⊆ [0,1] does not contain a least element.   From the [[ZFC]] axioms of set theory (including the [[axiom of choice]]) one can show that there is a well order of the reals. Also [[Wacław Sierpiński]] proved that ZF + GCH (the [[generalized continuum hypothesis]]) imply the axiom of choice and hence a well order of the reals. Nonetheless, it is possible to show that the ZFC+GCH axioms alone are not sufficient to prove the existence of a definable (by a formula) well order of the reals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Solomon Feferman |first=S. |last=Feferman |title=Some Applications of the Notions of Forcing and Generic Sets |journal=Fundamenta Mathematicae |volume=56 |issue=3 |year=1964 |pages=325-345 |url=https://eudml.org/doc/213821}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is consistent with ZFC that a definable well ordering of the reals exists—for example, it is consistent with ZFC that [[V=L]], and it follows from ZFC+V=L that a particular formula well orders the reals, or indeed any set.

An uncountable subset of the real numbers with the standard ordering ≤ cannot be a well order: Suppose ''X'' is a subset of '''R''' well ordered by ≤. For each ''x'' in ''X'', let ''s''(''x'') be the successor of ''x'' in ≤ ordering on ''X'' (unless ''x'' is the last element of ''X''). Let ''A'' = { (''x'', ''s''(''x'')) | ''x'' ∈ ''X'' } whose elements are nonempty and disjoint intervals. Each such interval contains at least one rational number, so there is an [[injective function]] from ''A'' to '''Q'''. There is an injection from ''X'' to ''A'' (except possibly for a last element of ''X'' which could be mapped to zero later). And it is well known that there is an injection from ''Q'' to the natural numbers (which could be chosen to avoid hitting zero). Thus there is an injection from ''X'' to the natural numbers which means that ''X'' is countable. On the other hand, a countably infinite subset of the reals may or may not be a well order with the standard "≤". For example,

* The natural numbers are a well order under the standard ordering ≤.
* The set {1/n : n =1,2,3,...} has no least element and is therefore not a well order under standard ordering ≤.

Examples of well orders:
*The set of numbers { − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | 0 ≤ ''n'' &lt; ω } has order type ω.
*The set of numbers { − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''m''−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | 0 ≤ ''m'',''n'' &lt; ω } has order type ω². The previous set is the set of [[limit point]]s within the set. Within the set of real numbers, either with the ordinary topology or the order topology, 0 is also a limit point of the set. It is also a limit point of the set of limit points.
*The set of numbers { − 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; | 0 ≤ ''n'' &lt; ω } ∪ { 1 } has order type ω + 1. With the [[order topology]] of this set, 1 is a limit point of the set. With the ordinary topology (or equivalently, the order topology) of the real numbers it is not.

== Equivalent formulations ==
If a set is [[Total order|totally ordered]], then the following are equivalent to each other:

# The set is well ordered. That is, every nonempty subset has a least element.
# [[Transfinite induction]] works for the entire ordered set.
# Every strictly decreasing sequence of elements of the set must terminate after only finitely many steps (assuming the [[axiom of dependent choice]]).
# Every subordering is isomorphic to an initial segment.

== Order topology==
Every well-ordered set can be made into a [[topological space]] by endowing it with the  [[order topology]].

With respect to this topology there can be two kinds of elements:
*[[isolated point]]s — these are the minimum and the elements with a predecessor.
*[[limit point]]s — this type does not occur in finite sets, and may or may not occur in an infinite set; the infinite sets without limit point are the sets of order type ω, for example '''N'''.

For subsets we can distinguish:
*Subsets with a maximum (that is, subsets which are [[Bounded set#Boundedness in order theory|bounded]] by themselves); this can be an isolated point or a limit point of the whole set; in the latter case it may or may not be also a limit point of the subset.
*Subsets which are unbounded by themselves but bounded in the whole set; they have no maximum, but a supremum outside the subset; if the subset is non-empty this supremum is a limit point of the subset and hence also of the whole set; if the subset is empty this supremum is the minimum of the whole set.
*Subsets which are unbounded in the whole set.

A subset is [[Cofinal (mathematics)|cofinal]] in the whole set if and only if it is unbounded in the whole set or it has a maximum which is also maximum of the whole set.

A well-ordered set as topological space is a [[first-countable space]] if and only if it has order type less than or equal to ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ([[first uncountable ordinal|omega-one]]), that is, if and only if the set is [[countable]] or has the smallest [[uncountable]] order type.
