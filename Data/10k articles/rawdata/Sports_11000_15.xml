The '''1965 [[Southeast Asian Games|Southeast Asian Peninsular Games]]''' officially known as the '''3rd Southeast Asian Peninsular Games''' was a Southeast Asian multi-sport event held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], from 14 to 21 December 1965 with 14 sports featured in the games. Originally to be hosted by Laos, the third edition of the games was hosted by Malaysia after the former was not able to honour its hosting commitment citing financial difficulties and would later known to have hosted the [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]] decades later. Two years earlier, the third SEAP Games was cancelled as Cambodia pulled out of hosting the event due to internal strife. This was the first time Malaysia host the games. Malaysia is the third country to host the Southeast Asian Peninsular Games, which later known as the Southeast Asian Games after Thailand and Myanmar, then Burma. The games was opened and closed by Ismail Nasiruddin, the King of Malaysia at the Stadium Merdeka. The final medal tally was led by Thailand followed by host Malaysia and Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;[[Percy Seneviratne]] (1993) ''Golden Moments: the S.E.A Games 1959-1991'' [[Dominie Press]], [[Singapore]] {{ISBN|981-00-4597-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''2009 [[GP Ouest-France]]''' was a one-day [[road bicycle racing|road race]] which took place on 23 August 2009 in [[Plouay]], [[France]]. The race was held over {{convert|229|km|mi}}, which is 12 laps of a circuit. 2009 was the fifth time that the race has been part of the [[UCI ProTour]], but the race can be dated back to 1931 at its present location. The race was won by the Australian [[Simon Gerrans]], his first victory in a major one-day race. Frenchman [[Pierrick Fédrigo]] came in second, with [[Paul Martens]] of Germany coming in third. Gerrans won a sprint from a five-man breakaway group which also included [[Anthony Roux]] of France and [[Dan Martin (cyclist)|Dan Martin]] of Ireland.

'''Foot hockey''' (also known as '''Hocker''') is a [[sport]] related to [[hockey]] in which the only [[Sports equipment|equipment]] is a ball, most commonly a [[tennis ball]], that is kicked about the playing surface by the players in an attempt to score a goal on the opposing [[goaltender]]. It has been described as a "combination of hockey, soccer and handball"&lt;ref&gt;[[#desc|Adair]]: 2003, page P13. Foot hockey is sort of a combination of hockey, soccer and handball. Its end-to-end action just like in hockey.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a form of soccer with a tennis ball".&lt;ref&gt;[[#harris|Harris]]: 2005, pg 97. ...more like a form of soccer with a tennis ball, on streets and in parks.&lt;/ref&gt; Foot hockey is played indoors or outdoors; footwear is optional indoors, but must be worn by either all or none of the players. It may be unisex or coed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pawlenty|Pawlenty]]: , page 20. A few different rules applied, but the full-contact nature of the sport was fully intact. Even without pads. Even when your sisters were playing. It was a tough game, and you got to know it fast because everyone got in on the action.&lt;/ref&gt; Participation in foot hockey produced fewer [[Catastrophic injury|catastrophic injuries]] than other winter sports in studies from 1986 to 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tator|Tator]]: 2008, page 363. Sports such as snowboarding and ice hockey produced a large number of injuries, whereas other winter sports, such as ringette, broomball, boot hockey, and curling, produced fewer injuries.&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is mostly played in [[grade school]]s,&lt;ref name="bryan 2002"&gt;{{cite book | title=The social dimensions of learning disabilities: essays in honor of Tanis Bryan | publisher=Psychology Press | author=Bryan, Tanis H. | year=2002 | pages=196 | isbn=0-8058-3918-6 | author2=Wong, Bernice Y.

The usual age of foot hockey players can range from 6 to 13 years old. Because it has few requirements regarding equipment and can be played on most hard surfaces, it is more accessible than ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blake|Blake]]: 2010, page 56. The Canadian identification with shinny is more comprehensive than with organized hockey because games like 'street hockey' or 'boot hockey' are open to all and do not cut off those who cannot afford team registration.&lt;/ref&gt; The game is listed amongst those to keep children interested in [[playground]] activities in the 1915 issue of ''The Playground'' published by the Playground Association of America.&lt;ref&gt;[[#PAA|Playground Association of America]]: 1915, [https://archive.org/stream/playground09playrich#page/340/mode/2up pages 340—341]. Other games to be played are: Volley ball, caddy, day and night, dodge ball, hang baseball, captain ball, long baseball, goal throwing, baseball, throw for distance, basket ball, battle ball, scrimmage, duck on rock, circle wrestling, tender green, three deep, marbles (ring), prisoners' base, hustle ball, foot and a half, mounted combat, foot hockey, fly ball catching. Athletic events can also be conducted by following the group or team idea.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Brian Mcfarlane's NHL Hockey 1984'', [[Brian McFarlane]] mentions how brothers [[Joe Mullen|Joe]] and [[Brian Mullen]] played the game as kids in arena stairwells while waiting for ice time at the rink.&lt;ref&gt;[[#nhl84|McFarlane]]: 1984. Often the boys would play "foot hockey" in the arena stairwell, using crushed paper cups as pucks.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anson Carter]]'s introduction to [[ice hockey]] was a game of foot hockey played in his hometown of [[Scarborough, Toronto|Scarborough]], [[Ontario]] when he was a child.&lt;ref&gt;[[#harris|Harris]]: 2005, page 193. Carter, the New York Rangers forward, grew up in the Toronto suburb of Scarborough where "foot hockey" was his introduction to the sport.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neal Broten]] played the game in his family's kitchen with his brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coffey|Coffey]]: 2005, page 146. Hockey was a way of life for Neal Broten almost from the start. Games would break out on the kitchen floor, three brothers battling around a rolled-up pair of socks. Out front on the street they'd play boot hockey...&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of the game, called "Sockey", is commonly played among elementary school children in Southwestern Quebec. Unlike the Ontario version, Sockey is most commonly played on outdoor hockey rinks in Fall and Spring using a soccer ball, designating specific board panels as "nets" and full body contact is permitted. Another variant of the game still called Foot Hockey, is played by children ranging from age 6 to 13. The version is played Southern and Eastern Ontario. The nets are either coats or the patterns among the walls, in this version players are allowed to move the ball with their feet and hands (by throwing it to each other) but must be kicked with their foot. Semi-Body contact is commonly allowed and the goalies commonly use baseball caps as gloves.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/Harper+invent+foot+hockey/5641044/story.html {{Dead link|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Manipur]], the game is called ''Khong-Kangjei''.&lt;ref name="sanajaoba 2003"&gt;{{cite book | title=Manipur, past and present | publisher=Mittal | author=Sanajaoba, Naorem | year=2003 | pages=198 | isbn=81-7099-853-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
There is one net at each end with one goaltender. The common goaltending equipment are jackets that are wore on backwards and untied so the ball does not hurt as it normally would, and in addition it is advantage as it covers up more of the net. After their goalie has possession of the ball he or she, can throw the ball, or kick down the court to one of their players. This sport is often played on asphalt or grass .

==Rules==
As in [[ice hockey]], the goaltender is an individual who guards the [[Net (device)|net]], in this case a makeshift area whose width is demarcated with available markers on the ground, such as the player's coats or snow piles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Coffey|Coffey]]: 2005, page 146. Out front on the street they'd play boot hockey, using two snow chunks for goalposts and walls of plowed snow as sideboards, the same as kids would on the Range and all over northern Minnesota.&lt;/ref&gt; The net's dimensions vary but are generally 4 to {{convert|6|ft|m}} wide and approximately 2 to {{convert|3|ft|m}} high. The goaltender may use a jacket or hat in order to stop the ball.&lt;ref&gt;[[#desc|Adair]]: 2003, page P13. You have to kick the tennis ball past the goaltender, who has a jacket or a hat to try to stop the ball.&lt;/ref&gt; A variation played outdoors is '''boot hockey''', played in the winter when most players are likely to be wearing boots,&lt;ref&gt;[[#northstar|Thorkelson]]: 2006. This is also the time when street hockey morphs into boot hockey—street hockey in boots. Play still happens in alleys and driveways, but frozen ponds, lakes, and rinks are better options.&lt;/ref&gt; and is a form of [[shinny]];&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blake|Blake]]: 2010, page 56. Everyone who ever played hockey has memories of shinny called pond hockey, street hockey, or boot hockey, depending on what part of the country you grew up in.&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''boot hockey'' also refers to a variant of [[street hockey]].

The rules are a mixture of those for [[ice hockey]] or [[floor hockey]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#intramural|Byl]]:2002 , page 88.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Association football|soccer]]. The primary equipment is a ball, usually a tennis ball,&lt;ref&gt;[[#intramural|Byl]]: 2002, pages 86—87. Nontraditional events are also a great opportunity equalizer. Some schools have had success with activities such as boot hockey (floor hockey without the sticks, and using a tennis ball that is advanced toward the goal by players kicking it), ...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scommessesportivemania"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scommessesportivemania.com/en/sport-bets/hockey-history-and-rules.html | title=Hockey History and Rules | publisher=Scommesse Sportive Mania | accessdate=March 19, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610190007/http://www.scommessesportivemania.com/en/sport-bets/hockey-history-and-rules.html | archive-date=2012-06-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; though any suitable object may be used;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blake|Blake]]: 2010, page 57. In fact, anything that is handy can substitute for a puck. Tennis balls are highly recommended, but everything from lumps of coal to small rocks to temperature-sensitive '[[Manure|road apples]]' will do.&lt;/ref&gt; sticks are not used.&lt;ref&gt;[[#intramural|Byl]]:2002 , page 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Each player may kick the ball, either in an attempt to score a goal by sending the ball past the goaltender into the net, by passing the ball to a teammate, or by advancing the ball into the opponents territory and chasing it. Some variants will forgo a goaltender.&lt;ref&gt;[[#uspond|U.S. Pond Hockey Championships]], rule 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Players are allowed to use their hands to catch the ball, in the event that it is in the air, but are not allowed to pick it up off the ground. If a player does catch a ball, he or she is able to throw or place it on the ground, but only to themselves. In other words, the ball cannot be [[Pass (ice hockey)|hand passed]] to another player, or thrown into the net.

In organised events, helmets may be required,&lt;ref&gt;[[#uspond|U.S. Pond Hockey Championships]], rule 7&lt;/ref&gt; and is recommended by some.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tator|Tator]]: 2008, page 366. Always wear a helmet, faceguard, and the appropriate padding and footwear in ringette, broom ball, and boot hockey.&lt;/ref&gt; The game is considered to be a safe sport.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tator|Tator]]: 2008, page 365. When these risks are avoided, broomball, curling, boot hockey, and ringette are considered to be safe, low-risk activities.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the important rules is interference. If the goalie is kicked or pushed it is an interference and the team which was interfered is granted the ball and is no goal if it enters the net. There are also interferences during out of net play. The common playground interference is when people that aren't playing run into the way of the ball. The consequences differ for this sort of affair from a penalty shot to the interfered teams position. Arguing can be a big matter too. The majority of goaltenders tend to argue about disallowing goals, if it is interference, or them just claiming the ball never hit the net. In this case some will argue so much that the players will use an alternate method and give them a penalty shot. During a penalty shot players can call rebounds or no rebounds. Without rebounds it is an advantage for the defending team. They may also call slides or no slides. A slide is when the goalie charges towards the player taking the penalty shot and blocking the ball with their body.

==Training use by sports professionals==
For Christmas 2001, [[Danièle Sauvageau]], head coach of the [[Canada women's national ice hockey team]] from 2000 to 2002, and video editor Ryan Jankowski prepared a video named ''Just Smile'' given as part of a Christmas package to each of the players. Among other events, it documented a game of foot hockey between the players, which was described by Sally Manning in her book ''A golden tear: Danièle Sauvageau's journey to Olympic gold'' as a favourite warm-up for the team.&lt;ref&gt;[[#2001women|Manning]]: 2002. After Newfoundland, the players were given a week-long hiatus from hockey to return home for the Christmas break. Danièle and Ryan Jankowski, the video expert, had put together a Christmas package for each to open under the tree. It was a video entitled ''Just Smile''. The footage documented good times the team had shared together over the 2001 season: the obstacle course at Val Cartier; an aerobic session in the gym; a Finnish sauna experience; a game of foot hockey, a favourite warm-up; gift-giving at the end-of-the-year Christmas party.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Kelly]], a [[quarterback]] in the [[National Football League]] in the 1980s and 1990s, played foot hockey with neighbourhood children as a child.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Roth|Roth]]:1994, page 19. In the winter boys played foot hockey on the frozen river. In the summer they would dive into the Allegheny River off a giant steel bridge near town.&lt;/ref&gt; US politician [[Tim Pawlenty]] played a variant of boot hockey as a child.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pawlenty|Pawlenty]]: , page 20. For years my dad set up a little ice rink in the backyard so the neighbourhood kids could come over for games of hockey. sometimes the game was boot hockey, sort of like ice hockey but without the skates, usually played with a tennis ball instead of a puck.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Guerin Sportivo''''' is an Italian sports magazine. Founded in 1912&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Foot|title=Winning at All Costs: A Scandalous History of Italian Soccer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NBufCsXpkVkC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=1 August 2015|date=24 August 2007|publisher=Nation Books|isbn=978-1-56858-652-6|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Turin]], it is published every month and is the oldest sport magazine in the world.

The title and the logo, depicting a medieval knight throwing a javelin, are inspired by the lead character in [[Andrea di Barberino]]'s chivalric romance ''[[Il Guerrin Meschino]]'' ("The Wretched Warrior"), written in 1410.

Originally, it was printed on green paper, whence the popular nickname ''[[:wiktionary:verde|verdolino]]'', and also housed satyrical panels. Characters used in his panels by artist Carlin (a zebra for [[FC Juventus|Juventus]], a female wolf for [[AS Roma|Roma]], a devil for [[AC Milan|Milan]] and others) inspired most of the symbols of Italian sides used today. In the mid-1970s ''Guerin Sportivo'' moved from newspaper to magazine format, starting to include a greater number of photos. Since its origins, most of the concern was devoted to soccer, other sports being given less detail. Since the 1990s virtually all pages are dedicated to soccer.

Journalists who worked for the magazine include [[Gianni Brera]], [[Indro Montanelli]], [[Giorgio Tosatti]], [[Darwin Pastorin]], [[Carlo Nesti]], [[Mario Sconcerti]], [[Stefano Disegni]] and [[Rino Tommasi]].

In 2007 the circulation of ''Guerin Sportivo'' was 45,067 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dati ADS (tirature e vendite)|url=http://www.fotografi.org/periodici_tirature.htm#SETTIMANALI|work=Fotografi|accessdate=26 April 2015|language=Italian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424142426/http://www.fotografi.org/periodici_tirature.htm#SETTIMANALI|archivedate=24 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Guerin Sportivo'' is published by Conti Editore S.r.l..&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sportnetwork.it/conti.html&lt;/ref&gt; The publisher itself was owned by Corriere dello Sport S.r.l., the publisher of ''[[Corriere dello Sport – Stadio]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.contieditore.it/il-gruppo/&lt;/ref&gt; (70%)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2016 bilancio, Corriere dello Sport S.r.l.|publisher=Italian [[Camera di Commercio, Industria, Agricoltura e Artigianato|C.C.I.A.A.]]|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Nuova Editoriale Sportiva S.r.l., the publisher of ''[[Tuttosport]]'' (30%). The two daily sports newspapers were owned by [[Roberto Amodei]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.calcioefinanza.it/2017/09/02/bilancio-corriere-dello-sport-2016-perdita-ricavi-copie/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.primaonline.it/2016/05/02/234904/le-testate-sportive-del-gruppo-amodei-corriere-dello-sport-stadio-tuttosport-e-guerin-sportivo-media-partner-di-spothacktag/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hampshire Senior Cup''' is a [[Single-elimination tournament|cup competition]] open to [[association football|football]] teams affiliated with the [[Hampshire Football Association]]. The competition was founded in 1887 and has been contested every year since, with the exception of 1914 to 1919 when it was postponed due to the First World War.&lt;ref name="winners"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshirefa.com/FixturesAndResults/CountyCups/SaturdaySeniorCup/Archive/2008-2009/SaturdaySeniorCup.htm?js=1&amp;tab=about|title=Hampshire Senior Cup – Previous Winners|publisher=[[Hampshire Football Association]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303001755/http://www.hampshirefa.com/FixturesAndResults/CountyCups/SaturdaySeniorCup/Archive/2008-2009/SaturdaySeniorCup.htm?js=1&amp;tab=about|archivedate=3 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the name, teams from Wiltshire, Dorset, the Isle of Wight and the Channel Islands have also competed in this competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/content/articles/2004/11/07/football_countycups_report_11_06_feature.shtml | title=Win, draw and defeat in County Cups | publisher=BBC | date=2004-11-07 | accessdate=2008-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as teams representing the Police and any armed forces based within the county. The competition is open to teams from all levels of competition from the [[Premier League]] down to Level 10 of the [[English football league system]],&lt;ref name="cup rules" /&gt; and a number of league teams have won this competition in the past. However, it is mostly non-league clubs who compete for this trophy instead of their league counterparts as all teams associated with the Hampshire FA are required to compete, with the exception of Premier League and [[English Football League]] teams who may opt out of the competition for a nominal fee.&lt;ref name="cup rules"&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.hampshirefa.com/NR/rdonlyres/3908BF58-718C-4CA2-80CC-8C912B4F6B9D/0/HampshireFACountyCupRules.doc  | title = County Cup Competition Rules  | publisher = Hampshire Football Association  | accessdate = 15 April 2010  | format = DOC  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090529222251/http://www.hampshirefa.com/NR/rdonlyres/3908BF58-718C-4CA2-80CC-8C912B4F6B9D/0/HampshireFACountyCupRules.doc  | archivedate = 29 May 2009  | df = dmy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current champions are [[Havant &amp; Waterlooville F.C.|Havant &amp; Waterlooville]], who defeated [[Winchester City]] on penalties, after the game finished 1-1 after 90 minutes, in the 2016 final held at [[St Mary's Stadium]], Southampton. Havant and Waterlooville F.C. also won 2018 HSC by defeating Blackfield and Langley in a 3-0 win at St Mary’s once again.

In April 2012, [[FIFA]] announced that the [[Hawk-Eye]] sensor system would be used in an experimental capacity at that year's final between [[A.F.C. Totton]] and [[Eastleigh F.C.|Eastleigh]] as part of a series of ongoing reliability and accuracy tests of goal-line technology systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/27/fifa-goalline-technology | title=Fifa to test goalline technology in Hampshire FA Senior Cup final | publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/9674664.FIFA_to_experiment_at_Hampshire_Senior_Cup_final/ | title=FIFA to experiment at Hampshire Senior Cup final | publisher=[[Southern Daily Echo]] | date=27 April 2012 | accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 9 October 2013, a tie was played between [[Brockenhurst F.C.|Brockenhurst]] and [[Andover Town F.C.|Andover Town]]. After the match finished 0-0 after extra time, the subsequent [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] resulted in 29 consecutive goals being scored, with Brockenhurst winning 15-14. This was later confirmed by [[the Football Association]] as an English record (and possibly a world record) for the highest number of consecutive goals scored in a penalty shootout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24535150|title=Penalty shoot-out record: Brockenhurst 15-14 Andover|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|first=Nabil|last=Hassan|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/brockenhurst-and-andover-town-score-29-consecutive-penalties-to-set-new-record-8882084.html|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Simon|last=Rice|title=Brockenhurst and Andover Town score 29 consecutive penalties to set new record|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2013/oct/15/penalty-shootout-record-shooting-goals-barrel-video|title=Penalty shootout record: like shooting goals in a barrel?|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/non-league-sides-set-penalty-shoot-record-160337267.html|title=Non-league sides set penalty shoot-out record|work=[[Eurosport]]|date=15 October 2013|accessdate=16 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131018052759/http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/pitchside-europe/non-league-sides-set-penalty-shoot-record-160337267.html|archivedate=18 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Helsinki 69ers''' are an [[American football]] club from [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]]. The club was formed in 1991, and its men's first team is currently playing in [[Vaahteraliiga]], the top tier of American football in Finland.

== History ==
The Helsinki 69ers were formed in 1991. The team started in the lower divisions of Finnish American football and slowly made its way up to [[Finnish 1st Division (American football)|1st Division]]. The 69ers played 10 seasons in the division, and in 2012, the 69ers won the 1st Division championship, the Spaghettibowl. 69ers won the final against [[Kouvola Indians]] with a score of 43-10. For the first time the 69ers had a chance to play in the [[Vaahteraliiga]], the highest level in Finland. The team played its first Vaahteraliiga game in [[2013 Vaahteraliiga season|2013 season]] against [[Vantaa TAFT|TAFT]], losing 41-14.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helsinki 69ers divarin mestaruuteen|url=http://www.gridiron.fi/blog/2012/08/18/helsinki-69ers-divarin-mestaruuteen/|website=gridiron.fi|publisher=Gridiron|accessdate=26 November 2014|language=Finnish|date=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=69ers - In English |url=http://www.69ers.fi/in-english/ |website=69ers.fi |publisher=Helsinki 69ers |accessdate=26 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530102516/http://www.69ers.fi/in-english/ |archivedate=30 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Helsinki 69ers Are Ready For The Maple League|url=http://www.touchdown-europe.net/2013/02/finland-helsinki-69ers-are-ready-for.html|website=Touchdown-europe.net|publisher=Touchdown Europe|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club shares their stadium, the [[Helsinki Velodrome]], with two other football teams from Helsinki: the [[Helsinki Roosters]] and the [[Helsinki Wolverines]].

== Club Structure ==
The 69ers men's first team played in [[Vaahteraliiga]] in the 2014 season and placed sixth after the regular season, missing the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sarjataulukko - Vaahteraliiga 2014|url=http://www.sajl.org/selaus/sarjataulukko.php?sarja=1&amp;kausi=2014|website=Salj.org|publisher=American Football Federation of Finland|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The youth section of the club was founded in 2005. 69ers have five boys' youth teams: U11, U13, U15, U17 and U19.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Juniorit|url=http://www.69ers.fi/juniorit/|website=69ers.fi|publisher=Helsinki 69ers|accessdate=26 November 2014|language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3185">The '''Hot Rod Magazine Championship Drag Races''' were a series of [[drag racing]] events sponsored by ''[[Hot Rod Magazine]]'' between 1961 and 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Thom.  Untitled item  in ''Hot Rod Magazine'', February 2017, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered "one of the most significant drag racing events" of that era.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The races were held at [[Riverside International Raceway|Riverside Raceway]] in [[Riverside, California]] starting in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  The total prize value awarded was US$37,000, more than a [[National Hot Rod Association]] (NHRA) national event purse at the time, and included (at first) a brand new [[Ford Mustang (first generation)|Ford Mustang]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hot Rod'' publisher [[Ray Brock]] and editor [[Bob Greene]] worked with NHRA to arrange a summer event that would not create a scheduling conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Held over three days, and run under NHRA regulations, all the pro classes were hosted, including [[Top Fuel]], [[Top Gas]], and [[Top Alcohol]], and including [[Dragster (car)|dragster]], [[funny car]], [[Modified (drag racing)|modified]], and [[Altered (drag racing)|altered]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the insistence of [[Wally Parks]], a full slate of [[Sportsman (drag racing)|Sportsman]] classes was also offered.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1964 winner was [[Gas Ronda]], in his {{convert|427|cid|abbr=on}}-powered [[Ford Fairlane (Americas)|Thunderbolt]], taking home a [[Plymouth Barracuda]] as part of the prize package.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, Phil. "Remembering Gas Ronda", written 26 October 2017, at [https://www.nhra.com/news/2017/remembering-gas-ronda NHRA.com] (retrieved 16 September 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the championship first hosted A/FX (Factory Experimental) cars (which later evolved into funny cars).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  That year, in TF/D (Top Fuel Dragster), [[Don Prudhomme]] and [[Tom McEwen (drag racer)|Tom McEwen]] each turned in 7-second passes at {{convert|211|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, but ultimately, Top Fuel Eliminator (TFE) went to [[Jim Warren (drag racer)|Jim Warren]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;  That year's racing was also the subject of a film produced by ''Hot Rod'', "The Hot Rod Story—Drag Racing", narrated by [[Dick Enberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1966 championship, McEwen would win the Top Fuel title, while [[Mike Snively]] did (in [[Roland Leong]]'s [[Hawaiian (dragster)|''Hawaiian'']], with a 7.07 second pass at {{convert|221.66|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}) in 1967.  In 1968, it went to [[Steve Carbone]] in the ''Atlas Oil Tool Special''.  The final year the event was held, [[Larry Dixon, Sr.]] won TFE in [[Rattler (dragster)|''Rattler'']] (sponsored by [[Howard Cams]]).&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydraulic circuit training machines were first developed for The Henley Corporation in the 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shapesforwomen.com/hydraulicfitness.asp Shapes for Women]&lt;/ref&gt; and are now becoming an increasingly popular form of exercise. 

The fundamental principles behind these designs are based on [[fluid dynamics]]: Force that is applied at one point is transmitted to another point using an incompressible fluid known as hydraulic oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/hydraulic1.htm How Stuff Works Science edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

For circuit training applications, each piece of equipment is specifically designed for a given exercise. The effort is applied through the range of motion of the exercise acts on a [[lever]] against a piston which moves linearly within a  hydraulic cylinder. The cylinder is filled with hydraulic oil which is displaced by the motion of the piston, and is allowed to flow to the opposite side of the piston through an adjustable orifice.

Resistance to the motion is determined by the amount of effort applied and the adjustment size of the orifice.  This is a key feature of this design and allows the resistance to be adjusted to an individual's strength level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.healthfxamerica.com/healthmaxpro/guide/index.html Healthmax Pro]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indoor cricket''' is a variant of and shares many basic concepts with [[cricket]]. The game is most often played between two teams each consisting of six or eight players.&lt;ref name='rules'&gt;[http://www.cricket.com.au/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_1732F3EF2E82622590956CD1084379E3E80F0A00/filename/Indoor-Cricket-Rule-Book.ashx "Rules of Indoor Cricket"] from ''Cricket Australia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Several versions of the game have been in existence since the late 1960s, whilst the game in its present form began to take shape in the late 1970s and early 1980s.&lt;ref name="shorter"&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/twenty20wc/content/story/309625.html "Shorter, simpler, sillier" in ''ESPNcricinfo''], 7 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional cricket has been played indoors at [[Docklands Stadium]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/221031.html "Article on enclosed Docklands Stadium"] from ''ESPNcricinfo''&lt;/ref&gt; The codified sport of indoor cricket is not to be confused with conventional cricket played indoors, or with other modified versions of cricket played indoors (see [[Indoor cricket#Other forms of indoor cricket|other forms of indoor cricket]] below).

==The game of indoor cricket==
In terms of the concept of the game indoor cricket is similar to [[cricket]]. Like its outdoor cousin, indoor cricket involves two batsmen, a bowler and a team of fielders. The bowler ''bowls'' the ball to the batsmen who must score runs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/ "Laws and Spirit of Cricket"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220005023/http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket |date=20 February 2010 }} from ''MCC''&lt;/ref&gt; The team with the highest score at the end of the match wins. Despite these basic similarities, the game itself differs significantly from its traditional counterpart in several ways, most notably on the field of play and the means by which runs are obtained.

==International rules overview==

===Safety gear===
Just like every other sport, warm ups and stretching is a must.
As a minimum, every player, including the fielders have to wear an abdominal guard (box), with the person bowling the ball as an exception.
The batsman are required to play batting gloves, primarily for preventing the bat from slipping out of the hands. indoor batting gloves are readily available at cricket stores, however some indoor cricket facilities also provide basic non-slip gloves that can be shared during the game.
Some players prefer to use hard ball batting gloves to prevent their hands from serious injury, as the indoor cricket ball can cause serious damage.
One optional security gadget is the safety goggles, like the ones used in squash, to prevent any serious injury to the eyes.
As the game speed is usually very fast and the play really rigorous, its is a demanding cardiovascular activity. It is recommended to have a doctor checkup before taking up indoor cricket, especially in advance age and/or with any medical conditions.
Remember, it's fielders right of way when a shot is played, so the batsman/fielder has to be watchful to avoid collisions. 
Be mindful of the fact that indoor cricket cause more sporting injuries than casual outdoor cricket, due to the proximity of the ball and fielders. Therefore, a sports/team insurance is very important. Some indoor sports facilities provide these insurances as part of the indoor tournaments.

===Playing arena===
{{Main|Indoor cricket court}}
The length of an indoor cricket [[cricket pitch|pitch]] is the same as a conventional cricket pitch, and has 3 [[stump (cricket)|stump]]s at each end, but there the similarities end. The arena is completely enclosed by tight netting, a few metres from each side and end of the pitch. The playing surface is normally artificial grass matting. Whilst the pitch is the same length, however, the [[batsman|batsmen]] do not have to run the entire length. The striker's [[crease (cricket)|crease]] is in the regulation place in front of the stumps, but the non-striker's crease is only halfway down the pitch.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;

===Players===
Indoor cricket is played between 2 teams of 8 players. Each player must [[bowling (cricket)|bowl]] 2 eight ball [[over (cricket)|over]]s, and bat in a partnership for 4 overs. A faster version of the game exists, where each side is reduced to 6 players and each innings lasts 12 overs instead of 16.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;

===Equipment===
The stumps used in indoor cricket are not, for obvious reasons, stuck in the ground. Instead, they are collapsible spring-loaded stumps that immediately spring back to the standing position when knocked over. The ball used in indoor cricket is a modified [[cricket ball]], with a softer centre. The ball also differs in that it is yellow to make it more obvious to see indoors against varied backgrounds. Both traditional outdoor cricket bats or more specialised lighter-weight indoor cricket bats may be used.  The gloves are typically lightweight cotton with no protective padding on the outside.  The palm-side of the gloves usually have embedded rubber dots to aid grip.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;

===Scoring===
Scoring in indoor cricket is dived into 4 types: physical runs, bonus runs, the usual extras/sundries and penalty-minus runs. Physical runs are scored by both batsmen completing a run from one crease to the other. Bonus runs are scored when the ball hits a net. Bonus scores for particular parts of the nets follow:
*Zone A (front net – '''behind''' the keeper): 0 runs
*Zone B (side nets between the striker's end and halfway down the pitch): 1 run
*Zone C (side nets between halfway and the bowlers end): 2 runs
*Zone D (back net – behind the bowler): 4 or 6 runs depending on the manner in which the ball hit the back net.
**On the bounce: 4 runs
**On the full: 6 runs
*Zone B or C onto Zone D: 3 runs
NB: For bonus runs to be scored, at least one physical run must be scored. The bonus runs are then added to the physical runs. For example, a batsman strikes the ball, hitting the back net on the full (6) and makes one physical run, for a total of 7 runs.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;
Extras/sundries are the same as those in formal cricket and consist of wides, no balls etcetera.
Penalty-minus runs are the set number of runs deducted from a team’s score for each dismissal.

===Dismissals===
A batsman can be dismissed in the same ways they can be in conventional cricket – with variations in the case of LBW and mankad (see below) – and with the exception of ''timed out''. When a batsman gets dismissed, however, five runs are deducted from their total and they continue to bat. Batsmen bat in pairs for 4 overs at a time, irrespective of whether they are dismissed. A player can also be "caught" by a ball rebounding off a net, except off a "six", as long as it has not previously touched the ground. This negates any physical or bonus runs that might have been awarded.

A method of dismissal in indoor cricket that is far more prevalent than its outdoor counterpart is the [[mankad]]. A mankad is given out if the bowler completes their bowling action without releasing the ball, breaks the stumps at their end without letting go of the ball and the non-striker is out of their ground.

Whilst [[Leg before wicket|lbw]] is a valid form of dismissal in indoor cricket, it is a far rarer occurrence in indoor than it is in outdoor cricket. A batsman can only be dismissed lbw if he does not offer a shot and the umpire is satisfied that the ball would then have hit the stumps.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;

===Officials===
Indoor cricket is officiated by one umpire who is situated outside of the playing area at the strike batsmen's end of the court. The umpire sits or stands on a raised platform that is usually 3 metres above ground level.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt; Secondary officials (such as scorers or video umpires) have sometimes been utilised in national or international competition.

===Result===
The team with the higher score at the conclusion of each innings is declared the winner of the match. The second innings continues for a full 16 overs even if the batting side passes the first innings total due to the possibility of a side finishing behind a total even after they have surpassed it (see dismissals above).&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;

In most cases indoor cricket is played according to a skins system, where the batting partnerships from each innings are compared against one another and the higher of the two is deemed to have won the skin. For example, the second batting partnership in the first innings might score 5 runs whilst the second partnership in the second innings scores 10 – the latter would be deemed to have won the skin. The team that has won the greater of the four skins available is often awarded the win if the totals are tied.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt;

==3 Dot balls Rule ==
Most indoor cricket centres employ a dot ball rule, where the scoreboard has to change at least every third ball. This means if the batsmen play 2 consecutive balls without a change in the scorecard (applies on multiple batsmen over multiple over), the scorecard has to change on the 3rd ball. It can be changed by batsman scoring a run, extra runs or in the case where a run is not scored on the 3rd consecutive ball, the batsman is declared out and 5 runs deducted off the score, hence changing the scorecard.

===Jackpot ball Rule===
Some indoor leagues have the first or last ball of a 'Skin' declared a jackpot ball. This means any runs scored on the jackpot ball will be doubled. e.g. if a '7' is hit, it will counted as 14 runs and if a wicket is lost, it will be counted as minus 10 runs.

==Types of match and competition==

Indoor cricket is typically played either as a six- or eight-a-side match, and with six- or eight-ball overs respectively.&lt;ref name='rules' /&gt; The game can be played in men's, women's and mixed competitions.  Permutations of the game include bonus overs (where the bonus score is double, dismissals result in seven (7) runs (cf. five (5) runs) being deducted from the team score and fielding restrictions removed.)

===Test Match===
Test indoor cricket is the highest standard of indoor cricket and is played between members of the [[World Indoor Cricket Federation]].&lt;ref name='wicf'&gt;[http://www.worldindoorcricketfederation.com/tournaments.html "International competition"] from ''WICF''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first international Test matches were played between Australia and New Zealand in 1985. Those sides have since been joined on the international stage by England (1990), South Africa (1991), Zimbabwe (1998), Namibia (1998), India (2000), Pakistan (2000), Sri Lanka (2002), United Arab Emirates (2004), Wales (2007), France (2007), Guernsey (2007), Singapore (2013), Malaysia (2017).

Test matches are usually played in a group of matches called a "series" featuring two to four nations. These series can consist of three to five matches and where more than two nations are involved, may also include a finals series.&lt;ref name='wicf' /&gt; Matches played at [[Indoor Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] events are also considered Test matches.

International competition is also organised for juniors and masters age groups. The matches are considered Test matches within their respective divisions.&lt;ref name='wicf' /&gt;

Since 1985, most Test series between Australia and New Zealand have played for the Trans Tasman trophy. Similarly, since 1990, Test series between Australia and England have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes, a name borrowed from [[The Ashes|the trophy]] contested by the same nations in outdoor cricket.&lt;ref name='wicf' /&gt;

===National championships===
Each member nation of the WICF usually holds its own national titles. In Australia, states and territories compete in the Australian Indoor Cricket Championships (as well as the now defunct National League).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricket.com.au/pv_obj_cache/pv_obj_id_4C91902E0F9238F8826941738C20444DD2010500/filename/2012%20AJC%20Tournament%20Wrap.ashx "Australian Open Championships tournament wrap"] from ''Cricket Australia''&lt;/ref&gt;

The national competition in New Zealand is referred to as the Tri Series and is contested by three provinces – Northern, Central and Southern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzindoorsports.org.nz/130/ "Tri-Series results"] from ''NZ Indoor Sports''&lt;/ref&gt;

National championships contested elsewhere in the world include South Africa's National Championship&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indoorcricketsa.co.za/pages/juniorst/ "National Championships"] from ''Indoor Cricket South Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; and England's National League.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecbic.co.uk/national/national-league/ "National League"] from ''ECB Indoor Cricket''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor Competition===
In addition to social competition played throughout the world there are several state leagues and competitions within each nation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecbic.co.uk/national/british-pen/ "British Open"] from ''ECB Indoor Cricket''&lt;/ref&gt; Various states, provinces or geographical areas organise their own state championships (referred to in Australia as "Superleague" – not to be confused with the [[Super League (Australia)|ill-fated Rugby League competition]]). Various districts, centres or arenas take part in these competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indoorsportsvictoria.com.au/competitions/superleague/superleague-indoor-cricket.php "Superleague"] from ''Indoor Sports Victoria''&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Cup===
{{Main|Indoor Cricket World Cup}}
The Indoor Cricket World cup was first held in Birmingham, England in 1995 and has run every two or three years since. The event usually also features age-group, masters' and women's competitions. The last World Cup was held in Wellington (NZ) in October 2014. Australia came first in the boys', girls', women's and men's competitions. Australia has won all 9 Open Men World Cup titles (since 1995) and all 8 Open World Cup titles (since 1998).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cricket.com.au/default.aspx?s=news-display&amp;id=17476 "2009 world cup results"] from ''Cricket Australia''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and development of indoor cricket==
The first significant example of organised indoor cricket took place, somewhat unusually, in Germany. A tournament was held under the auspices of the [[Husum Cricket Club]] in a hall in [[Flensburg]] in the winter of 1968–69.&lt;ref name="shorter" /&gt;

It was not until the 1970s that the game began to take shape as a codified sport. Conceived as a way of keeping cricketers involved during the winter months, various six-a-side leagues were formed throughout England in the first half of the decade, eventually leading to the first national competition held in March 1976 at the Sobell Center in Islington.&lt;ref name="shorter" /&gt; This distinct form of indoor cricket is [[Indoor cricket (UK variant)|still played today]].

Despite the early popularity of the sport in England, a different version of indoor cricket developed by two different parties in [[Perth, Western Australia]] in the late 1970s evolved into the sport known as indoor cricket today. Against the backdrop of the upheaval in the conventional game caused by World Series Cricket, torrential rain and a desire to keep their charges active led cricket school administrators [[Dennis Lillee]] and [[Graeme Monaghan]] to set up netted arenas indoors. Concurrently, entrepreneurs [[Paul Hanna]] and [[Michael Jones (entrepreneur)|Michael Jones]] began creating an eight-a-side game that eventually led to the nationwide franchise known as [[Indoor Cricket Arenas]] (ICA). It was not long before hundreds of ICA-branded stadiums were set up throughout Australia, leading to the first national championships held in 1984 at a time where over 200,000 people were estimated to be participating in the sport.&lt;ref name="shorter" 

The sport underwent several organisational changes, most notably in Australia and in South Africa (where competing organisations fought for control of the sport), but the game has changed little since that time and has risen in popularity in several nations. Under the auspices of the World Indoor Cricket Federation the sport has reached a point where is played according to the same standard rules in major competitions throughout the world.

==International structure of indoor cricket==
The World Indoor Cricket Federation is the international governing body of cricket. It was founded prior to the 1995 World Cup by representatives from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldindoorcricketfederation.com World Indoor Cricket Federation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nations may either be full members or associate members of the WICF.&lt;ref name='wicfmembers'&gt;[http://worldindoorcricketfederation.com/countries.html "Countries"] from ''WICF''&lt;/ref&gt; Each member nation has its own national body which regulates matches played in its country. The national bodies are responsible for selecting representatives for its national side and organising home and away internationals for the side.

==Other forms of indoor cricket==

===Conventional cricket indoors===

Conventional cricket matches have taken place at covered venues (usually featuring a retractable roof) and can thus be regarded as cricket being played indoors. Such matches are relatively infrequent and come with added complications in the event that the ball makes contact with the roof while in play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportal.com.au/cricket-news-display/roof-hits-now-a-six-214674 "Roof hits now a six in BBL"] from ''Sportal'', accessed 28 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===UK variant===
{{Main|Indoor cricket (UK variant)}}

A version of indoor cricket (bearing greater resemblance to conventional cricket) is played exclusively in the United Kingdom. This variant sees the six players on each team utilise the same playing and protective equipment that can be found in outdoor cricket, and is played in indoor facilities that differ greatly from the international form of indoor cricket.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.ecb.co.uk/files/2925-nfc-six-a-side-2012-p47-54-lr-11959.pdf "Competition Rules"] from ''ECB Indoor Club Championships'', accessed 28 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite lacking international competition, this form of indoor cricket enjoys a strong following in the UK, and, like its international counterpart, enjoys the support of the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/non-first-class/ecb-indoor-six-a-side-championship/lords-joy-for-whitstable,317213,EN.html?Pf=com.otherobjects.cms.model.structure.Folder-L-258 "Lord's joy for Whitstable"] from ''ECB'', accessed 28 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2378">'''Lord's Middle Ground''' was a [[cricket]] venue in [[London]] that was established by [[Thomas Lord]] in 1811.  It was used mainly by [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] for major matches until 1813, after which Lord was obliged to relocate because the land was requisitioned for the cutting of the [[Regent's Canal]].

==Matches==
The first match known to have been played at Lord's Middle Ground was B Aislabie's XI v G Osbaldeston's XI in July 1811.&lt;ref name=S&amp;B&gt;[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores &amp; Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744-1826), Lillywhite, 1862&lt;/ref&gt;  Only three [[First-class cricket|first-class]] matches were ever recorded at the ground, one in each season between 1811 and 1813 at the height of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/597_f.html CricketArchive – matches played at Lord's Middle Ground].  Retrieved on 25 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Rice (cricketer)|James Rice]] played all three matches of his first-class career at the Middle Ground and, equally, all the matches ever played at the Middle Ground featured James Rice.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/37/37580/First-Class_Matches.html CricketArchive – first-class matches played by James Rice].  Retrieved on 25 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Lord's Middle Ground was at North Bank at the north end of [[Lisson Grove]], just south of the modern ground.  In 1814, Lord opened the present [[Lord's Cricket Ground]], formerly a duckpond in [[St John's Wood]].

'''[[Mali]]''' competed at the '''[[2012 Summer Olympic Games]]''' in [[London]], from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's twelfth appearance at the Olympics, it was not represented at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal because of the African boycott.

As no Malian teams qualified for the team events, Mali sent its smallest delegation to the Games after the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] in Sydney. Six Malian athletes, 4 men and 2 women, were selected to the team to compete in 4 sports. Hurdler [[Rahamatou Drame]], who competed at her first Olympic games, was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.

Mali, however, has yet to win its first ever Olympic medal. Taekwondo jin and double-time world heavyweight champion [[Daba Modibo Keita]] missed out of the nation's historic Olympic record, after he withdrew from the bronze medal tournament because of the injuries he had sustained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cuba's Despaigne, Mexico's Espinoza take taekwondo bronze|url=http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/sports/2012/08/11/cuba-despaigne-mexico-espinoza-take-taekwondo-bronze/|publisher=Fox News Latino|date=11 August 2012|accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ottawa Giants''' were a professional [[minor-league baseball]] team based in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], Canada that operated in 1951 after the relocation of an existing [[Triple-A (baseball)|Triple-A]] franchise, the [[Jersey City Giants]]. It played at [[Lansdowne Park]] in Ottawa and finished with a 62–88 record, in seventh place in the eight-team [[International League]] and 31 games in arrears of the regular season and playoff champion [[Montreal Royals]].  The Ottawa Giants drew 117,411 fans&lt;ref name="liz"&gt;{{Cite book| editor1-last=Johnson| editor1-first=Lloyd| editor2-last=Wolff| editor2-first=Miles| title=The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball| edition=2nd| location=Durham, North Carolina| publisher=Baseball America| year=1997| isbn=978-0-9637189-8-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the Lansdowne Park turnstiles, also seventh in the league.
[[File:lansdowne park 1950.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Lansdowne Park, 1950s]]

==History==
As radio and television broadcasts of New York City area baseball teams increased, Jersey City's attendance plunged from 337,000 in 1947 to 63,000 in 1950. Ottawa had most recently hosted the ''Nationals'' and the ''Senators'' of the Class C [[Border League (baseball)|Border League]] from 1947–50, leading that league in attendance for three of its four seasons and making the playoffs each year.

The Jersey City franchise was purchased by [[Tommy Gorman]] and moved to Ottawa in 1951 becoming the '''Ottawa Giants,''' a farm team of the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]. After one season, and disappointing attendance, the Giants (who owned and operated another Triple-A team in the [[Minneapolis Millers]] of the [[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]) abandoned Ottawa. However, the [[Philadelphia Athletics]] were interested in replacing the New Yorkers, and in 1952, the [[Ottawa Athletics]] were formed.

The '''Sammy Ofer Stadium''' ({{lang-he|אצטדיון סמי עופר}}), also known as '''Haifa International Stadium''' ({{lang-he| האצטדיון העירוני חיפה}}), is a 30,780 seats [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Haifa]], [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kssgroup.com/projects/sammy-ofer-stadium.php www.kssgroup.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Construction began in late 2009 and was completed in 2014. The stadium was developed and built by the Haifa Economic Corporation, managed by Adv. Gal Peleg. Currently, the stadium is used mostly for [[Association football|football]] matches, hosting the home games of [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] and [[Hapoel Haifa F.C.]] The stadium replaced [[Kiryat Eliezer Stadium]], which was closed in 2014 and demolished in 2015. The stadium is named after the late Israeli billionaire [[Sammy Ofer]], who donated [[United States dollar|$]]20,000,000 to build the stadium. Ofer's contribution was 19% of the total cost of the stadium.

==History==
On September 16, 2008, the Haifa Construction Committee approved the stadium's plans and gave it the green light.

On August 2009, official plans of the stadium released.

On September 2009, it has been announced that the works on building the foundations of the stadium would begin at the end of September 2009.
The first official match ever at Sammy Ofer Stadium was played on August 27, 2014. [[Hapoel Haifa]] hosted Hapoel Acre (TOTO CUP) and won 2–0. The first historic goal in the new stadium was scored by Hapoel Haifa striker [[Tosaint Ricketts]]. 
The first league match was played on September 15, 2014. [[Maccabi Haifa F.C.|Maccabi Haifa]] hosted [[Bnei Sakhnin F.C.]], who they defeated by a score of 4–2. The historic first goal by a Maccabi Haifa player was scored by Israeli national team midfielder [[Hen Ezra]] during stoppage time of the first half. Over 31,000 supporters were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;http://maccabi-haifafc.walla.co.il/?w=/3036/2785849 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225210835/http://maccabi-haifafc.walla.co.il/?w=%2F3036%2F2785849 |date=2014-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[UEFA Champions League]] match was played on September 30, 2015 by [[Maccabi Tel Aviv F.C.|Maccabi Tel Aviv]] against [[Dinamo Kiev]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2016/matches/round=2000634/match=2015685/postmatch/report/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Dinamo won 2–0 by goles [[Andriy Yarmolenko]] and [[Júnior Moraes]] .

The first match of the [[Israel national football team]] was played on November 16, 2014. Israel hosted the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team]] in the [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] match and won the match by a score of 3–0. The stadium was sold out, which resulted in an atmosphere beyond compare, helping Israel win their 3rd game in a row in the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/11/16/europe/european-championship-qualification/israel/bosnia-herzegovina/1653243/?ICID=PL_MS_24&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United Arab Emirates Chess Federation''' ('''UAECF''') was established in October 1976 to spread and develop the game of [[chess]] as a mental and cultural sport across the [[United Arab Emirates]]. It organizes national tournaments such as the [[Emirati Chess Championship]].

The UAECF took part in the [[Against Chess Olympiad]] held in [[Libya]] in 1976. In 1977, it became a member of FIDE. Later on, chess started to spread across all Emirates and chess clubs were set up in [[Dubai]], [[Sharjah (city)|Sharjah]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Ajman]], [[Fujairah]] and [[Al-Ain]].
[[Chess &amp; Culture Club for Sharjah Women]] was opened in 1991 and another club for women was affiliated with [[Dubai Chess and Culture Club]] in 2000.
now there are 16 club officially registered in UAE chess federation. 
All these clubs play a key role in the discovery and training the young talents, and later on UAECF choose the best players for the national teams, where they come for training under supervision of head coach of UAECF.

==Major achievements==
Emirati native [[Saeed Ahmed Saeed]] won the 1979 [[World Youth Chess Championship#Under-14 winners|Under-14 World Chess Championship]] held in [[Mexico]] and this was the first achievement for UAE in chess at the international level. He repeated the feat in 1981 and was referred to in Arab media as "The Arab computer."
Rouda Essa Alserkal recently had the world title as (( world chess championship Under 8 girls, 2017 in Brazil)).

==History==
Karagümrük Stadium was initially used as a football home ground in 1926, in the middle of a dip garden waves from [[Byzantium|Byzantium Era]], called [[Çukurbostan]] in Çukurbostan district of Fatih. Stadium is constructed in ''[[Cistern of Aetius|Aetius Cistern]]'', on Fevzi Paşa Caddesi  ({{lang-en|Fevzi Paşa Avenue}}), heading to [[Edirnekapı, Istanbul|Edirnekapı]] district of Fatih.&lt;ref name=kenthaber&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.kenthaber.com/Haber/Genel/Kose/yilmaz-erguvenc/vefa-stadi--/cfbfd111-a6a9-4861-9dce-328d09522e31|publisher=kenthaber.com  |accessdate=2011-09-19 |year= 2008|title= Vefa Stadı |language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the Byzantiumeferences, the cistern is built in [[AD]] 420, by praetorian prefect [[Aetius (praetorian prefect)|Aetius]] during the rule of [[Theodosius II]] (reigned between 408 – 450).&lt;ref name=kenthaber/&gt; The cistern is 244x84 m. and 15 m. deeper than surface, surrounded by 15 m. high walls.&lt;ref name=kenthaber/&gt; Due to the archeological importance of the cistern, the walls had been protected at the initial stadium project.

The conversion had been started in 1926. In 1945, when the stadium construction was finalized, the tenant rights were taken over  by [[Hasan Âli Yücel]], an alumnus of [[Vefa Lisesi]] and former [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Minister of National Education]], and given to by [[Vefa SK]],an other football club of the district; as Stadium also was renamed Vefa Stadı.

===Renovation===
The renovation of stadium has begun to be conducted in 2007, with 30.000.000 [[New Turkish Lira|TRY]] grand cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://v3.arkitera.com/news.php?action=displayNewsItem&amp;ID=22900 |publisher=arkitera.com  |author= |accessdate=2011-09-19 |date= 2007-12-10|title= Belediye’den Vefa Stadı’na vefa!..|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting 11.722 seated 3 all-covered stands (including 7.648 behind the goal, 1.024 for away side and 24 seats for visitors), one 66m2 VIP lodge, 6 normal lodges, and a 682 seats capacity VIP stand.&lt;ref name=tumgazeteler&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=2441171 |publisher=tumgazeteler.com  |author= Kılıç, Yasin |accessdate=2011-09-19 |date= 2007-12-23|title= Karagümrük Stadı spor kompleksine dönüştürülecek|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sunumer.ibb.gov.tr/karagumruk-stadi-spor-kompleksi |publisher=ibb.gov.tr  |author= |accessdate=2011-09-19 |date= 2007-12-10|title= TKaragümrük Stadı Spor Kompleksi|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt; also includes [[basketball]], [[table tennis]], and [[martial arts]] facilities.&lt;ref name=tumgazeteler2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tumgazeteler.com/?a=2420792 |publisher=tumgazeteler.com  |author= |accessdate=2011-09-19 |date= 2007-12-23|title= Tarihi Karagümrük Stadı kompleks oluyor|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''West Side Park''' was the name used for two different [[baseball]] parks that formerly stood in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. They were both home fields of the team now known as the [[Chicago Cubs]] of the [[National League]]. Both [[baseball park|park]]s hosted baseball championships. The latter of the two parks, where the franchise played for nearly a quarter century, was the home of the first two world champion Cubs teams ({{baseball year|1907}} and {{baseball year|1908}}), the team that posted the best winning percentage in Major League Baseball history and won the most games in National League history ({{baseball year|1906}}), the only cross-town World Series in Chicago ([[1906 World Series|1906]]), and the immortalized [[Tinker to Evers to Chance]] double-play combo. Both ballparks were what are now called "wooden" ballparks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Patrick M. |last=O'Connell |date=October 4, 2017 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/baseball/cubs/ct-cubs-west-side-grounds-met-20171004-story.html |title=Cubs Last Won Back-to-Back World Series Titles at Mostly Forgotten West Side Grounds, Now UIC |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=October 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first West Side Park (1885–1891)==

The initial stadium was the club's home beginning in {{baseball year|1885}}, succeeding [[Union Base-Ball Grounds|Lakefront Park]]. Although the park's useful life turned out to be as short as the ball club's stay at the Lakefront (seven years), it was also memorable, as the team won back-to-back National League pennants in its first two seasons there.

The park was located on a small block bounded by Congress, Loomis, Harrison and Throop Streets, with the diamond toward its western end.  The elongated shape of the block lent a bathtub-like shape to the park, with foul lines reportedly as short as 216 feet. The stadium held roughly 10,000 fans. In addition to the diamond, the park held a [[bicycle]] track which encircled the playing field, at the height of the contemporary [[bicycle craze]].

The Cubs (then known as the White Stockings) had had to secure a new property after {{baseball year|1884}}, and it took longer than anticipated. The season began on April 30, a month later than it does today, for a 112-game schedule, 50 fewer games than today's major-league schedule. The club spent the first five-plus weeks of the 1885 season on the road [http://www.baseball-almanac.com/teamstats/schedule.php?y=1885&amp;t=CH6] and the park was finally opened on June 6 with a victory over the [[St. Louis Maroons/Indianapolis Hoosiers|St. Louis Maroons]], late of the [[Union Association]]. Despite being "wanderers" early in the season, the powerful Chicago club, under player-manager [[Cap Anson]], came home with an 18-6 record. They would sweep a four-game set in their first homestand and romp through the league schedule, finishing at 87-25. The only team that gave them any problem was the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], who won 10 of the clubs' 16 meetings and finished just two games behind Chicago in the standings. If projected to a modern 162-game schedule, that translates to 125 and 123 wins, respectively, in a very lopsided league (the third-place club finished 30 games back).

[[Image:West Side Park ca1885.JPG|thumb|right|300px|First West Side Park c. 1885]]

Chicago captured the National League [[pennant (baseball)|pennant]] that season and also went on to win the league crown in 1886. The site saw postseason action those two years, as the White Stockings squared off in 19th-century [[World Series]] play against the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], then playing in the rival [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] and known as the St. Louis Browns. The championships of the 1880s were disorganized in comparison to the modern World Series, exemplified by the 1885 contest, which ended in dispute with no clear winner. The 1886 World Series was more conventional, and was won by the Browns. Those matchups were the first on-field confrontations of the Cubs and Cardinals clubs, which remains one of baseball's strongest rivalries today.

The site also saw "bonus baseball" in 1887, as a neutral site for Game 14 of that year's unique 15-game "traveling" World Series between the Browns and the [[Detroit Wolverines]]. In 1891 the team split its schedule between West Side Park and [[South Side Park]].  The first West Side Park was abandoned after the 1891 season, with the team playing at home exclusively on the South Side in 1892.

The site of the first West Side Park is now occupied by the [[Andrew Jackson Language Academy]], whose address is 1340 West Harrison.

==The second West Side Park (1893–1915)==
[[Image:West Side Grounds 1905.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Action at a Cubs-Sox exhibition series, 1905]]

In May 1893, the club opened the second '''West Side Park''' a few blocks west-southwest of the first one, on a larger block bounded by Taylor, Wood, Polk and Lincoln (now Wolcott) Streets. It was located at {{coord|41|52|13|N|87|40|21|W|type:landmark}}. During May and June, they split their 1893 schedule with [[South Side Park]], playing Sunday games on the West Side and weekday games on the South Side. By mid-summer they had abandoned the South Side park and moved into the West Side park full-time.

Home plate for this ballpark was in the northwest corner of the property, toward the Polk and Lincoln intersection. The right field fence paralleled Taylor, with flat apartments between the alley behind the right field area, and Taylor itself. There were also flats across Wood Street to the east, behind left field, giving the park (for a few years, at least) a degree of the ambiance that [[Wrigley Field]] would later be famous for. [[Cook County Hospital]] was across the street to the north, behind third base. Like the first West Side ballpark, the new facility was restricted by the streets around it, creating a rectangular playing area.

The field layout was reported in the ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean|Inter Ocean]]'' on April 16, 1893: "The diamond is 90 feet from the grand stand, and the right and left field fences are 340 feet from the home plate, 130 feet further than the old west side fence. The distance from the home plate to the extreme center field is 560 feet. The club will play all their Sunday games at the new grounds during the World's Fair, and after the fair is closed will probably play all their games there."

An artist's conception of the new field includes a rooftop tier of private seating on the grandstand, and roofed bleachers beyond first and third base. Photographs from the early 1900s suggest those plans were left dormant until starting in 1905, when the team began playing well and expansion of the ballpark seating was begun.

Although the 340-560-340 sounds symmetrical, the left field side was much more spacious, and the distance to center was actually very deep left-center, possibly the far corner of the property.

The original layout of the park sat about 12,500 patrons. As with other parks of the era, fans were often permitted to stand along the outer perimeter of the playing field itself. When the team began playing winning ball under Frank Chance, overflow crowds became more frequent.

[[Image:West Side Park 1906 World Series.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Action in the 1906 World Series]]

On August 5, 1894, during its first full season as home to the Cubs (at that point known as the Colts), West Side Park suffered severe damage from fire during a game against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. As the fire spread through the first-base side stands, panicked fans trying to escape pressed up against the barbed wire fence separating them from the playing field. Only quick action by several players in wrenching the fence open averted a major tragedy. The burnt stands were simply roped off, and the season resumed the next day, with the burnt area fenced off, and the spectators sitting on the left side of the diamond.&lt;ref name="Snyder"&gt;{{cite book|last=Snyder|first=John|title=365 Oddball Days in Chicago Cubs History|year=2010|publisher=Accessible Publishing Systems|location=United States|isbn=9781459607255|page=570}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that near-disaster, the club rebuilt the burnt portion out of wood.

One highlight, albeit for the visitors, occurred on July 13, 1896, when [[Philadelphia Phillies]] outfielder/firstbaseman [[Ed Delahanty]] smacked four home runs in one game, only the second player to do so. In contrast to [[Bobby Lowe]]'s feat two years earlier, which was aided by a short foul line, two of Delahanty's were inside-the-park. After Delahanty's third, center fielder [[Bill Lange]] drew a laugh by calling "time", stationing himself in deep-deep center, near the clubhouse, seemingly a mile away, and then waving the pitcher to continue. Delahanty then got the laugh on Lange by knocking it between the clubhouse and the fence, again circling the bases while Lange scurried for the ball. The normally partisan home fans cheered Delahanty's effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=July 13, 1896: Ed Delahanty’s four-home run game |first=Jerrold |last=Casway |url=https://sabr.org/gamesproj/game/july-13-1896-ed-delahanty-s-four-home-run-game |work=SABR }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago got the last laugh, winning the game, 9–8.

[[Image:West Side Grounds Stands 1908.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Expanded left-side grandstand in 1908]]

As the park entered the new century, it featured a small covered grandstand behind home plate.  Behind the home plate stands, the team and ticket offices were housed in a fairly ornate two-story brick building topped with statues of baseball players.  Uncovered [[bleachers]] extended along both foul lines and into left field.  Beyond left-center field, the bleachers gave way to a small clubhouse.  The right-field bleachers were only nine rows deep, sitting underneath a free-standing billboard that ran above the length of the bleachers. The billboard frequently featured large ads for the sports pages and the sportswriters of local newspapers such as the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]''. A scoreboard was located on the extreme right end of the billboard, toward the right field corner.  Much like today at Wrigley Field, several of the rooftops beyond the outfield bleachers offered bleacher seating of their own, at least for a few years.

The second West Side Park was the home of the Cubs' most successful teams of the 20th century.  From 1906 through 1910, the Cubs won four National League pennants and two [[World Series]] championships.  The [[1906 World Series]] between the Cubs and the [[Chicago White Sox]] featured the first cross-town matchup in Series history.  Although the Cubs had one of the most successful seasons in major league history, winning 116 contests against just 36 losses, they were defeated by the light-hitting White Sox four games to two.  The Cubs finally brought a championship to West Side Park the following year when they swept the [[Detroit Tigers]] after ending the first contest in a tie.  In 1908, West Side Park became the home of the first repeat world champions when the Cubs again bested the Tigers.  After a one-year absence, the Cubs returned to the Series in 1910, only to lose in five games to the [[Philadelphia Athletics]]. The 1908 championship 
turned out to be the franchise's last World Series championship until 2016, ending a staggering 108-year drought for the franchise.

[[Image:West Side Grounds 1908.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Right field area and rooftop bleachers in 1908.]]

The ballpark expanded with the club's rising fortunes.  For 1905, several rows of private box seats were built on top of the original grandstand roof behind home plate.  That same year saw the construction of a new two-story brick clubhouse structure, fronted by columns, out in far left-center.  After just two seasons, jury-box bleachers were built directly in front of and over the clubhouse. During the 1908 season, the bleachers along the first and third-base lines were gradually covered and topped by more private box seating.

By the early 1910s the wooden ballpark was showing its age, in large part due to neglect by Charles Murphy, the unpopular owner of the Cubs (one of whose alternate, media-driven nicknames was the unflattering "Murphy's Spuds"). In 1910, the neighborhood view beyond the nearby right field bleachers was blocked off by an enormous billboard. In 1912, the more distant left field view was similarly obstructed by a large billboard, which also served as the new scoreboard.  The enclosure of the park was completed with the installment of billboards in dead center.  At this time, the jury box bleachers in left-center field were removed, adding to the new claustrophobic feel of the outfield. With gambling becoming an increasing problem in baseball, starting in 1911 the playing field was adorned with large signs (as with some other major league ballparks) reminding both fans and players, "No Betting Allowed." Additionally, the dilapidated park found itself competing unsuccessfully with new steel-and-concrete baseball venues. The [[Chicago White Sox]] inaugurated [[Comiskey Park]] in 1910. Four years later, the upstart [[Federal League]] placed a franchise on the North Side and began play in [[Weeghman Park]]. By 1915, the Cubs were the third most popular team in a three-team city.

When the Federal League collapsed after the 1915 season, Charles Weeghman, owner of the now-defunct [[Chicago Whales]], was allowed to buy a substantial interest in the Cubs. One of his first acts was to abandon West Side Park and move the Cubs to Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. Weeghman Park survives today as [[Wrigley Field]].

[[Image:West Side Park 1916.jpg|thumb|left|250px|West Side Park hosting ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'' in 1916, the year after the Cubs moved across town to [[Wrigley Field|Weeghman Park]].]]

One of the few items the Cubs took with them, besides normal operational properties, was a set of large letters comprising a sign that had run across the back of the grandstand and was to be read from the outside of the park: "{{small caps|Chicago National League Ball Park}}". This sign was placed along the top of the Weeghman Park wall bordering Sheffield Avenue, visible to everyone in the park, and of course reading ''backwards'' to the spectators. This oddity lasted a few years at Weeghman / Cubs Park until it was brought down during an early remodeling.

West Side Park continued to host semipro and amateur baseball events for a few years. It even served as a setting for ''[[Buffalo Bill's Wild West]]'', thus converting the entire former ballfield into a different kind of "bull pen". The ballpark was torn down in 1920. Murphy, who still owned the property, sold the leftover lumber for scrap. He sold the property itself to the [[University of Illinois]]. The site is now occupied by the [[University of Illinois College of Medicine|University of Illinois Medical Center]].

This West Side Park was the only park that witnessed the Cubs as World Series Champions from 1908 to 2016. The Cubs won back-to-back titles here in 1907 and 1908. In June 1909, a flag-raising ceremony was held, celebrating the Cubs second consecutive World Series. Newspaper reporters commented that the crowd seemed less enthused than they had the previous summer, as if they were getting complacent.{{cn|date=December 2017}}
