The '''Agriculture and Forestry University''' ('''AFU''') is a public agricultural university with central offices in [[Rampur, Chitwan]], [[Nepal]]. Organized in a manner similar to [[Agricultural Universities (India)|agricultural universities]] in India, it is the only such university in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afu.edu.np/about-us&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was created by the [[Parliament of Nepal]], which passed a bill in June 2010 merging two constituent campuses of [[Tribhuvan University]]: the Rampur Agriculture Campus of the [[Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science]] and the Forestry Campus, Hetauda of the Institute of Forestry in [[Hetauda, Makawanpur]]. The university exists to offer agricultural [[workforce development]] and promote research in agriculture, forestry, and allied disciplines. Through teaching, research, and extension programs in agriculture, livestock, and forestry, it aims to raise the socio-economic conditions of rural people.

==Academics==
The university has inherited undergraduate, graduate and PhD programs in agricultural sciences of Rampur Campus and undergraduate program in forestry of Hetauda Campus. The Rampur Campus offers undergraduate degrees including a four-year B.Sc. Ag, five-year B.V.Sc. and A.H, four-year B.Sc Fisheries, two-year Master programs in Agriculture, Animal Science, Veterinary Science and Aquaculture, and Ph.D. programs. 

In addition to its Bachelor of Forestry degree program, the Hetauda Forestry campus offers a Master of Forestry degree and PhD. 

The university has 140 faculty members located at the Rampur Agriculture Campus and 55 at the Hetauda Forestry Campus. The university strength consists of around 800 undergraduate students, 200 postgraduate students and around 50 Ph.D. scholars in disciplines of agriculture and forestry. The Rampur academic complex extends in an area of {{convert|280|ha|acre}} and the Hetauda Campus has an area of {{convert|95|ha|acre}}.

The faculty members focus their research work on increasing production and productivity of agricultural commodities, post-harvest technology, improving the shelf-life of food products, conserving biodiversity, and enhancing livelihood systems and innovation capacities of farming communities. The postgraduate students are contributing thesis research to generate knowledge and technologies to address the issues of agriculture and forestry in the nation.

==History==
Agriculture and Forestry University (AFU) was established as a result of a bill enacted by the Nepalese Parliament in June 2010 authorizing the creation of three new universities at campuses owned by [[Tribhuvan University]]. The Rampur Agriculture Campus, associated with the [[Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science]], and the Forestry Campus, Hetauda, associated with the [[Institute of Forestry]], were designated as campuses for the new university. As of February 2015, [[Tribhuvan University]] has refused to transfer ownership of the campuses to the new university, citing its autonomy from the Nepalese legislature, and the existing Rampur Agriculture Campus has yet to vacate its administrative offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1-last= Thapa |author1-first= Chitranga  |author2-last= Poudel |author2-first= Motilal |author3-last= Khatiwada |author3-first= Bimal |title=New ones struggle to get by |date=10 February 2015 |newspaper=Kathmandu Post |url=http://www.ekantipur.com/2015/02/10/development/new-ones-struggle-to-get-by/401518.html |accessdate=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, in 2015, the first AFU affiliated college was established in Puranchaur V.D.C. of Kaski district with the name College Of Natural Resource Management. This college is currently operating with Bachelors level of Agriculture faculty.

Total 50 students were enrolled as the first batch of the college.

==Campuses==
*Agriculture Campus, Rampur, Chitwan
*Forestry Campus, Hetauda, Makawanpur
*College of Natural Resource Management, Puranchaur, Kaski
The University Complex of AFU and its Central Office, including the offices of the Vice Chancellor and Registrar, are on the Rampur campus.

The '''Balkan Heritage Foundation''' (BHF) is a Bulgarian public, [[non-profit]], [[non-governmental]] organization. It was established in 2008 by a team of a cross-institutional program implementing archaeological field schools since 2003. Its head office is located in [[Stara Zagora]], Bulgaria. The BHF has a representative office located in [[Sofia]] and four branches located in [[Varna]], [[Mezek]], [[Dragoman]] and [[Emona]], Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bhfieldschool.org/bhfoundation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Balkan Heritage Foundation’s mission is to support the protection, conservation, management and promotion of cultural and historical (both tangible and intangible) heritage of [[South-eastern Europe]] as necessary preconditions for sustainable development of the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngobg.info/bg/organizations/3089-%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE-%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%BE.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation collaborates on both the local and global level with [[universities]], [[museums]], [[research institutes]], [[Mass media|media]], business [[companies]], [[governmental]] and [[non-governmental organizations]]. It raises funds and consequently funds projects implemented by research institutes and scientific teams, museums, municipalities and local communities. Since it was established, the foundation has been implementing and financially supporting the following programs, projects and activities:

==Balkan Heritage Field School==
[[File:Balkan Heritage Field School.jpg|thumb|Balkan Heritage Field School at [[Heraclea Lyncestis]], Republic of Macedonia.]]
The '''Balkan Heritage Field School''' ('''BHFS''') is an archaeological field school annually providing a number of courses (projects) in [[archeology]], [[anthropology]] and [[history]] of [[South-Eastern Europe]], documentation, [[conservation-restoration|conservation and restoration]] of historic artifacts and monuments, taught in English and located within [[Bulgaria]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhfieldschool.org|title=Balkan Heritage Field School - Archaeology and Conservation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school admits both academic students and non-academic students. The BHFS, operating since 2003, was fully incorporated by the Balkan Heritage Foundation in 2008.

===Activities===
The BHFS courses are affiliated with ongoing excavation (Neolithic settlement in Ilindentsi, [[Tell Yunatsite]], Bresto, emporion [[Pistiros]], [[Stobi]], Bona Mansio and [[Sozopol|Apollonia Pontica]] conservation and documentation projects contributing to the study and preservation of the Balkan cultural heritage and are usually supplemented by trips to attractive historical sites and cities in [[Bulgaria]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Greece]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. The school concept envisions that every course combines three basic educational modules: theoretical (lectures, presentations and field trainings), practical (either excavation field work and lab work or conservation of historic artifacts and monuments) and excursions plus behind-the-scene visits. The BHFS courses are listed among the academic courses of [[New Bulgarian University]], [[Queen's University]], Kingston, Canada; and [[UCLA Extension]], enabling their participants to obtain credit hours upon request.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Tell Yunastite-1.jpg|thumb|Balkan Heritage Field School students at [[Tell Yunatsite]], Bulgaria.]]

The BHFS functions as a legal part of the Balkan Heritage Foundation, a Bulgarian public, non-profit, non-governmental organization. Since 2003 the BHFS has organized 85 courses in the field of archaeology, documentation of medieval frescoes and conservation of Ancient Greek and Roman pottery, mural paintings and mosaics. These courses have been attended by more than 1500 students from 55 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhfieldschool.org/about/about-us|title=About BHFS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Program's head office is located in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]]. Costs of courses and study materials can be found by viewing the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhfieldschool.org/project|title=Find Your Project - Balkan Heritage Field School|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BHFS admission fees support the Balkan Heritage Protection Fund.

{{American socialism |expanded=Activists}}
'''Bayard Rustin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|aɪ|.|ər|d}}; March 17, 1912&amp;nbsp;– August 24, 1987) was an American leader in [[social movement]]s for [[civil rights]], [[socialism]], [[nonviolence]], and [[gay rights]]. 

In the [[pacifist]] groups [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR) and the [[War Resisters League]] (WRL), Rustin practiced [[nonviolence]]&lt;!-- , which entails [[pacifism]] --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink1=Peter Brock (historian) |first1=Peter |last1=Brock |first2=Nigel |last2=Young |title=Pacifism in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Syracuse University Press |location=New York |year=1999 |isbn=0-8156-8125-9 |pages=230–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of the Communist Party before 1941, he collaborated with [[A. Philip Randolph]] on the [[March on Washington Movement]] in 1941 to press for an end to discrimination in employment. He was a leading activist of the early [[Civil Rights Movement]], helping to initiate a 1947 [[Journey of Reconciliation|Freedom Ride]] to challenge, with [[civil disobedience]], the [[racial segregation]] issue related to interstate busing. He recognized [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s leadership, and helped to organize the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] to strengthen King's leadership. Rustin promoted the philosophy of nonviolence and the practices of [[nonviolent resistance]], which he had observed while working with [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s movement in India, and helped teach Martin Luther King, Jr. about nonviolence.&lt;ref name="nps"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bayard Rustin|url=https://www.nps.gov/people/bayard-rustin.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustin became a leading strategist of the Civil Rights Movement from 1955 to 1968. He was the chief organizer of the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]], which was headed by [[A.&amp;nbsp;Philip Randolph]], the leading African-American labor-union president and socialist.&lt;ref name="Ebony"&gt;{{cite journal

After the passage of the civil rights legislation of 1964–65, Rustin focused attention on the economic problems of working-class and unemployed African Americans, suggesting that the civil-rights movement had left its period of "protest" and had entered an era of "politics", in which the black community had to ally with the labor movement. Rustin became the head of the [[AFL–CIO]]'s [[A.&amp;nbsp;Philip Randolph Institute]], which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans. The Institute under Rustin's leadership also advanced and campaigned for (from 1966 to 1968) ''A Freedom Budget for All Americans'', linking the concepts of racial justice with economic justice. Supported by over 200 prominent civil-rights activists, trade unionists, religious leaders, academics and others, it outlined a plan to eliminate poverty and unemployment in the United States within a ten-year period. Rustin became an honorary chairperson of the [[Socialist Party of America]] in 1972, before it changed its name to [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA); Rustin acted as national chairman of SDUSA during the 1970s. During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Communist Vietnam and Cambodia. At the time of his death in 1987, he was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti.

Rustin was a gay man who had been arrested early in his career for engaging in public sex. Rustin's sexuality, or at least his criminal charge, was criticized by some fellow pacifists and civil-rights leaders because it detracted from his effectiveness. Rustin was attacked as a "pervert" or "immoral influence" by political opponents from segregationists to conservative black leaders from the 1950s through the 1970s. In addition, his pre-1941 Communist Party affiliation when he was a young man was controversial, having caused scrutiny by the [[FBI]]. To avoid such attacks, Rustin served rarely as a public spokesperson. He usually acted as an influential adviser behind the scenes to civil-rights leaders. In the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay and lesbian causes.

President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued a statement on Rustin's death in 1987, praising his work for civil rights and his shift toward [[neoconservative]] politics over the years.&lt;ref name="apnewsarchive.com"&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Reagan-Praises-Deceased-Civil-Rights-Leader/id-96a87043e0eba7ae2215632d0e5230a5 Associated Press, "Reagan Praises Deceased Civil Rights Leader"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331134656/http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Reagan-Praises-Deceased-Civil-Rights-Leader/id-96a87043e0eba7ae2215632d0e5230a5 |date=March 31, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3b7syYOqskC&amp;q=bayard#v=snippet&amp;q=bayard%20rustin&amp;f=false Justin Vaïsse, Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement (Harvard University Press, 2010), p.71-75] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913115837/https://books.google.com/books?id=z3b7syYOqskC&amp;q=bayard#v=snippet&amp;q=bayard%20rustin&amp;f=false |date=September 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://neoconservatism.vaisse.net/doku.php?id=start#tablethe_three_ages_of_neoconservatism "Table: The Three Ages of Neoconservatism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320161743/http://neoconservatism.vaisse.net/doku.php?id=start#tablethe_three_ages_of_neoconservatism |date=March 20, 2016 }}, ''Neoconservatism: Biography of Movement'' by Justin Vaisse, official website]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 20, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] posthumously awarded Rustin the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].&lt;ref name="metroweekly1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Justin Snow |url=http://www.metroweekly.com/2013/11/obama-honors-bayard-rustin-and/ |title=Obama honors Bayard Rustin and Sally Ride with Medal of Freedom |publisher=metroweekly.com |accessdate=November 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rustin was born in [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]], to Florence Rustin and Archie Hopkins, but raised by his maternal grandparents, Julia (Davis) and Janifer Rustin, as the ninth of their twelve children; growing up he believed his biological mother was his older sister.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of African-American Culture and History|last = Carol|first = George|publisher = Gale|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0-02-865816-2|location = Detroit|pages = 1993–1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=biography.com&gt;[http://www.biography.com/people/bayard-rustin-9467932 Bayard Rustin Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430150408/http://www.biography.com/people/bayard-rustin-9467932 |date=April 30, 2016 }}, (2015), ''Biography.com''.

She was also a member of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP). NAACP leaders such as [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] and [[James Weldon Johnson]] were frequent guests in the Rustin home. With these influences in his early life, in his youth Rustin campaigned against racially discriminatory [[Jim Crow laws]].&lt;ref name='spartacus' &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USArustin.htm |title=Bayard Rustin Biography |publisher=Spartacus Educational |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419214532/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USArustin.htm |archivedate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, Rustin entered [[Wilberforce University]], a [[historically black college]] (HBCU) in Ohio operated by the AME Church. As a student at Wilberforce, Rustin was active in a number of campus organizations, including the [[Omega Psi Phi]] Fraternity. He was expelled from Wilberforce in 1936 after organizing a strike,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-02-01/entertainment/ct-ent-0202-museums-bayard-rustin-20120202_1_walter-naegle-bayard-rustin-brother-outsider |title=Not-so-secret life of gay civil rights leader Bayard Rustin |date=February 1, 2012 |first=Leslie |last=Mann |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later attended Cheyney State Teachers College (now [[Cheyney University of Pennsylvania]]). Cheyney honored Rustin with a posthumous "Doctor of Humane Letters" degree at its 2013 commencement.

After completing an activist training program conducted by the [[American Friends Service Committee]] (AFSC), Rustin moved to [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]] in 1937 and began studying at [[City College of New York]]. There he became involved in efforts to defend and free the [[Scottsboro Boys]], nine young black men in Alabama who were accused of raping two white women. He joined the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]] for a small period of time in 1936, before becoming disillusioned with the party.&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt; Soon after arriving in New York City, he became a member of Fifteenth Street Meeting of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (Quakers).

Rustin was an accomplished tenor vocalist, an asset which earned him admission to both Wilberforce University and Cheyney State Teachers College with music scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 2003, pp. 21, 24.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he was in the chorus of a short-lived musical that starred [[Paul Robeson]]. Blues singer [[Josh White]] was also a cast member, and later invited Rustin to join his band, "Josh White and the Carolinians". This gave Rustin the opportunity to become a regular performer at the [[Café Society]] [[nightclub]] in [[Greenwich Village]], widening his social and intellectual contacts.&lt;ref&gt;D'Emilio 2003, pp. 31–2.&lt;/ref&gt; A few albums on [[Bayard Rustin Sings a Program of Spirituals|Fellowship Records]] featuring his singing were produced from the 1950s through the 1970s.

==Political philosophy==
Rustin's personal philosophy is said to have been inspired by combining Quaker pacifism with socialism (as taught by [[A. Philip Randolph]]) and the theory of non-violent protest, popularized by [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=biography.com/&gt;

==Evolving affiliations==
Following directions from the Soviet Union, the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) and its members were active in the [[civil rights movement]] for African Americans.&lt;ref name="Kazin2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kazin|first=Michael|title=The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsWLGcZ7pyAC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=November 6, 2011|date=August 21, 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-3946-9|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Stalin's "theory of nationalism", the CPUSA once favored the creation of a separate nation for African-Americans to be located in the American Southeast, the center of the greatest concentration of black population.&lt;ref&gt;August Meier and Elliot Rudwick. ''Black Detroit and the Rise of the UAW.''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941, after Germany invaded the [[Soviet Union]], [[Joseph Stalin]] ordered the CPUSA to abandon civil rights work and focus on supporting U.S. entry into [[World War II]].

Disillusioned, Rustin began working with members of the [[Socialist Party USA|Socialist Party]] of [[Norman Thomas]], particularly [[A.&amp;nbsp;Philip Randolph]], the head of the [[Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters]]; another socialist mentor was the pacifist [[A.&amp;nbsp;J. Muste]], leader of the [[Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (FOR). FOR hired Rustin as a race relation secretary in the late summer of 1941.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Encyclopedia of African American History|last = Smith|first = Eric Ledell|publisher = ABC-CLIO, LLC|year = 2010|isbn = 978-1-85109-769-2|location = Santa Barbara, CA|pages = 1002–1004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three of them proposed a march on [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] in 1941 to protest racial segregation in the armed forces and widespread discrimination in employment. Meeting with President Roosevelt in the [[Oval Office]], Randolph respectfully and politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that African Americans would march in the capital unless desegregation occurred. To prove their good faith, the organizers canceled the planned march after Roosevelt issued [[Executive Order 8802]] (the [[Fair Employment Act]]), which banned discrimination in defense industries and federal agencies. The leader of the organizers, Randolph, canceled the march against Rustin's advisement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The armed forces were not desegregated until 1948, under an Executive Order issued by President [[Harry S. Truman]].

Randolph felt that FOR had succeeded in their goal and wanted to dissolve the committee. Again, Rustin disagreed with him and voiced his differing opinion in a national press conference, which he later regretted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Rustin traveled to California to help protect the property of the more than 120,000 Japanese Americans, most native-born, who had been [[Japanese-American internment|imprisoned in internment camps]]. Impressed with Rustin's organizational skills, A.J. Muste appointed him as FOR's secretary for student and general affairs.

Rustin was also a pioneer in the movement to desegregate interstate bus travel. In 1942, he boarded a bus in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], bound for [[Nashville]], and sat in the second row. A number of drivers asked him to move to the back, according to Southern practice of [[Jim Crow]], but Rustin refused. The bus was stopped by police 13 miles north of Nashville and Rustin was arrested. He was beaten and taken to the police station, but was released uncharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Fellowship | last = Rustin | first = Bayard | date = July 1942 | title = Non-Violence vs. Jim Crow}} reprinted in {{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Clayborne|authorlink1=Clayborne Carson|last2=Garrow|first2=David J.|authorlink2=David J.

In 1942, Rustin assisted two other FOR staffers, [[George Houser]] and [[James&amp;nbsp;L. Farmer,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], and activist [[Bernice Fisher]] as they formed the [[Congress of Racial Equality]] (CORE). Rustin was not a direct founder, but was "an uncle of CORE," Farmer and Houser said later. CORE was conceived as a pacifist organization based on the writings of [[Mohandas Gandhi]]'s who used [[non-violent resistance]] against British rule in [[India]]. CORE was also influenced by his protege [[Krishnalal Shridharani]]'s book ''War without Violence''.&lt;ref name="Hardiman2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Hardiman|title=Gandhi in His Time and Ours: The Global Legacy of His Ideas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1BMOHA2D7AC&amp;pg=PA256|year=2003|publisher=C.

Declared [[pacifism|pacifists]] who refused induction into the military, Rustin, Houser, and other members of FOR and CORE were convicted of violating the [[Selective Training and Service Act of 1940|Selective Service Act]]. From 1944 to 1946, Rustin was imprisoned in [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary]], where he organized protests against segregated dining facilities. During his incarceration, Rustin also organized FOR's Free India Committee. After his release from prison, he was frequently arrested for protesting against British colonial rule in [[India]] and Africa.

Just before a trip to Africa while college secretary of the FOR, Rustin recorded a 10-inch LP for the Fellowship Records label. He sang [[spirituals]] and [[Elizabethan]] songs, accompanied on the [[harpsichord]] by Margaret Davison.&lt;ref&gt;from liner notes, Fellowship Records 102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on the Civil Rights Movement==
{{Further|Civil Rights Movement}}
Rustin and Houser organized the [[Journey of Reconciliation]] in 1947. This was the first of the [[Freedom Rides]] to test the ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Irene Morgan#Arrest.2C jail and conviction|Morgan v. Commonwealth of Virginia]]'' that banned [[racial discrimination]] in interstate travel as unconstitutional. Rustin and CORE executive secretary George Houser recruited a team of fourteen men, divided equally by race, to ride in pairs through Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;Podair 2009, pp 27&lt;/ref&gt; The NAACP opposed CORE's [[Gandhism|Gandhian]] tactics as too meek. Participants in the Journey of Reconciliation were arrested several times. Arrested with Jewish activist [[Igal Roodenko]], Rustin served twenty-two days on a [[chain gang]] in [[North Carolina]] for violating state [[Jim Crow]] laws regarding segregated seating on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[The Crisis]] | date = September 1947 | title = Not So Deep Are the Roots | last = Peck | first = James | authorlink = James Peck (pacifist)}} reprinted in {{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Clayborne|last2=Garrow|first2=David J.|last3=Kovach|first3=Bill|title=Reporting Civil Rights: American journalism, 1941–1963|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9j8OAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=September 13, 2011|year=2003|publisher=Library of America|pages=92–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973832475|title=Harambee City : the Congress of Racial Equality in Cleveland and the rise of Black Power populism|last=Nishani,|first=Frazier,|date=2017|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|year=|isbn=9781610756013|location=Fayetteville|pages=43, 124|oclc=973832475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Rustin traveled to India to learn techniques of [[civil resistance|nonviolent civil resistance]] directly from the leaders of the Gandhian movement. The conference had been organized before Gandhi's assassination earlier that year. Between 1947 and 1952, Rustin also met with leaders of independence movements in [[Ghana]] and [[Nigeria]]. In 1951, he formed the Committee to Support South African Resistance, which later became the [[American Committee on Africa]].

Rustin was arrested in [[Pasadena, California]], in 1953 for sexual activity with another man in a parked car. Originally charged with vagrancy and lewd conduct, he pleaded guilty to a single, lesser charge of "sex perversion" (as [[sodomy]] was officially referred to in California then, even if consensual) and served 60 days in jail. This was the first time that his homosexuality had come to public attention. He had been and remained candid in private about his sexuality, although homosexual activity was still criminalized throughout the United States. After his conviction, he was fired from FOR. He became the executive secretary of the [[War Resisters League]]. Later, in Montana, an American Legion chapter made his conviction in Pasadena public to try to cancel his lectures in the state.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Remembering Bayard Rustin|last = D'Emilio|first = John|date = March 2006|journal = Magazine of History|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustin served as an unidentified member of the [[American Friends Service Committee]]'s task force to write "Speak Truth to Power: A Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://afsc.org/document/speak-truth-power |title=Available online from |publisher=AFSC |date=March 2, 1955 |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103150809/http://afsc.org/document/speak-truth-power |archivedate=November 3, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1955. This was one of the most influential and widely commented upon pacifist essays in the United States. Rustin had wanted to keep his participation quiet, as he believed that his known sexual orientation would be used by critics as an excuse to compromise the 71-page pamphlet when it was published. It analyzed the [[Cold War]] and the American response to it, and recommended non-violent solutions.

Rustin took leave from the War Resisters League in 1956 to advise minister [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] of the Baptist Church on Gandhian tactics. King was organizing the public transportation [[boycott]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], which became known as the [[Montgomery Bus Boycott]]. According to Rustin, "I think it's fair to say that Dr. King's view of non-violent tactics was almost non-existent when the boycott began. In other words, Dr. King was permitting himself and his children and his home to be protected by guns." Rustin convinced King to abandon the armed protection, including a personal handgun.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin "Bayard Rustin&amp;nbsp;– Who Is This Man"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516061236/http://stateofthereunion.com/home/season-2/bayard-rustin |date=May 16, 2013 }}, ''State of the Reunion,'' radio show, aired February 2011 on NPR, 1:40–2:10. Retrieved March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1964 interview with [[Robert Penn Warren]] for the book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]],'' Rustin also reflected that his integrative ideology began to differ from King's. He believed a social movement "has to be based on the collective needs of people at this time, regardless of color, creed, race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Bayard Rustin|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/bayard-rustin|website=Robert Penn Warren's Who Speaks for the Negro? Archive|accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Rustin and King began organizing the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC). Many African-American leaders were concerned that Rustin's sexual orientation and past Communist membership would undermine support for the civil rights movement. [[U.S. Representative]] [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]], who was a member of the SCLC's board, forced Rustin's resignation from the SCLC in 1960 by threatening to discuss Rustin's morals charge in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1978, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Rustin was open about his sexual orientation and his conviction was a matter of public record, the events had not been discussed widely beyond the civil rights leadership.

===March on Washington===
{{Main article|March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom}}
[[File:Bayard Rustin NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|200px|Rustin and [[Cleveland Robinson]] of the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] on August 7, 1963]]
Despite shunning from some civil rights leaders, {{quote|[w]hen the moment came for an unprecedented mass gathering in Washington, Randolph pushed Rustin forward as the logical choice to organize it.&lt;ref name="WP-20110821"&gt;{{cite news |first = Steve |last = Hendrix |url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/bayard-rustin-organizer-of-the-march-on-washington-was-crucial-to-the-movement/2011/08/17/gIQA0oZ7UJ_story.html |title =Bayard Rustin, organizer of the March on Washington, was crucial to the movement |work=The Washington Post |date = August 21, 2011 |accessdate = August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A few weeks before the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] in August 1963, [[List of United States Senators from South Carolina|South Carolina Senator]] [[Strom Thurmond]] railed against Rustin as a "Communist, draft-dodger, and homosexual," and had his entire Pasadena arrest file entered in the record.&lt;ref name="WP-20110821"/&gt; Thurmond also produced a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] photograph of Rustin talking to King while King was bathing, to imply that there was a same-sex relationship between the two. Both men denied the allegation of an affair.

Rustin was instrumental in organizing the march. He drilled off-duty police officers as marshals, bus captains to direct traffic, and scheduled the podium speakers. [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] and Rachelle Horowitz were aides.&lt;ref name="WP-20110821"/&gt; Despite King's support, NAACP chairman [[Roy Wilkins]] did not want Rustin to receive any public credit for his role in planning the march. Nevertheless, he did become well known. On September 6, 1963, a photograph of Rustin and Randolph appeared on the cover of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, identifying them as "the leaders" of the March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.life.com/image/52259555/in-gallery/23101#index/0 ''Life Magazine''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091105052431/http://www.life.com/image/52259555/in-gallery/23101#index/0 |date=November 5, 2009 }}, 6 September 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York City school boycott===
At the beginning of 1964, Reverend Milton Galamison and other Harlem community leaders invited Rustin to coordinate a citywide boycott of public schools to protest their [[de facto segregation]]. Prior to the boycott, the organizers asked the [[United Federation of Teachers]] Executive Board to join the boycott or ask teachers to join the picket lines. The union declined, promising only to protect from reprisals any teachers who participated. More than 400,000 New Yorkers participated in a one-day February 3, 1964 boycott. Historian [[Daniel Perlstein]] notes that "newspapers were astounded both by the numbers of black and Puerto Rican parents and children who boycotted and by the complete absence of violence or disorder from the protesters."&lt;ref name="perlstein"/&gt; It was, Rustin stated, and newspapers reported, "the largest civil rights demonstration" in American history. Rustin said that "the movement to integrate the schools will create far-reaching benefits" for teachers as well as students.&lt;ref name="perlstein"&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/justice/downloads/pdf/the_end_of_despair.pdf Daniel Perlstein, "The dead end of despair: Bayard Rustin, the 1968 New York school crisis, and the struggle for racial justice"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203513/http://www.nyc.gov/html/cchr/justice/downloads/pdf/the_end_of_despair.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}, New York City government&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest demanded complete integration of the city's schools (which would require some whites to attend schools in black neighborhoods), and it challenged the coalition between African Americans and white liberals. An ensuing white backlash affected relations among the black leaders. Writing to black labor leaders, Rustin denounced Galamison for seeking to conduct another boycott in the spring, and soon abandoned the coalition.&lt;ref name="perlstein"/&gt;

Rustin organized a May 18 march which called for "maximum possible" integration. Perlstein recounts. "This goal was to be achieved through such modest programs as the construction of larger schools and the replacement of junior high schools with middle schools. The UFT and other white moderates endorsed the May rally, yet only four thousand protesters showed up, and the Board of Education was no more responsive to the conciliatory May demonstration than to the earlier, more confrontational boycott."&lt;ref name="perlstein"/&gt;

When Rustin was invited to speak at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1964, school administrators tried to ban him, out of fear that he would organize a school boycott there. The flagship state university and local schools were still segregated.

===From protest to politics===
{{anchor|From Protest to Politics}}

In the spring of 1964, Rev. Martin Luther King was considering hiring Rustin as executive director of SCLC, but was advised against it by [[Stanley Levison]], a longtime activist friend of Rustin's. He opposed the hire because of what he considered Rustin's growing devotion to the political theorist [[Max Schachtman]]. "[[Schachtmanism|Schachtmanites]]" have been described as an ideologically cultish group with ardently [[anti-communist]] positions, and attachments to the Democratic Party and the [[AFL-CIO]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CUI6tY9RJUYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pillar+of+fire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NI0HVZrZMsHaUsWWgaAP&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shachtman&amp;f=false Taylor Branch, ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-1965'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1999), p. 292-293] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406210727/https://books.google.com/books?id=CUI6tY9RJUYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=pillar+of+fire&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NI0HVZrZMsHaUsWWgaAP&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=shachtman&amp;f=false |date=April 6, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1964 Democratic National Convention]], which followed [[Freedom Summer]] in Mississippi, Rustin became an adviser to the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] (MFDP); they were trying to gain recognition as the legitimate, non-[[Jim Crow]] delegation from their state, where blacks had been officially [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] since the turn of the century (as they were generally throughout the South) and excluded from the official political system. DNC leaders Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey offered only two non-voting seats to the MFDP, with the official seating going to the regular segregationist Mississippi delegation.

MFDP leaders, including [[Fannie Lou Hamer]] and [[Robert Parris Moses|Bob Moses]], angrily rejected the arrangement; many of their supporters became highly suspicious of Rustin. Rustin's attempt to compromise appealed to the Democratic Party leadership.&lt;ref name="perlstein"/&gt;

[[File:Bayard Rustin NYWTS 2.jpg|thumb|left|267px|Rustin, 1965]]

After passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], Rustin advocated closer ties between the civil rights movement and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], specifically the party's base among the white working class, many of whom still had strong union affiliations. With [[Tom Kahn]], Rustin wrote an influential article in 1964 called "From Protest to Politics," published in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine; it analyzed the changing economy and its implications for African Americans. Rustin wrote presciently that the rise of automation would reduce the demand for low-skill high-paying jobs, which would jeopardize the position of the urban African-American working class, particularly in northern states. He believed that the working class had to collaborate across racial lines for common economic goals. His prophecy has been proven right in the dislocation and loss of jobs for many urban African Americans due to restructuring of industry in the coming decades.

Rustin believed that the African-American community needed to change its political strategy, building and strengthening a political alliance with predominately white unions and other organizations (churches, synagogues, etc.) to pursue a common economic agenda. He wrote that it was time to move from protest to politics. Rustin's analysis of the economic problems of the Black community was widely influential.&lt;ref&gt;[[Staughton Lynd]], another civil rights activist, responded with an article entitled, "Coalition Politics or Nonviolent Revolution?"&lt;/ref&gt;

He also argued that the African-American community was threatened by the appeal of [[identity politics]], particularly the rise of "[[Black power]]." He thought this position was a fantasy of middle-class black people that repeated the political and moral errors of previous [[Black nationalism|black nationalists]], while alienating the white allies needed by the African-American community. ''Nation'' editor and [[Harvard Law School|Harvard Law]] Professor [[Randall Kennedy]] noted later that, while Rustin had a general "disdain of nationalism," he had a "very different attitude toward Jewish nationalism" and was "unflaggingly supportive of [[Zionism]]."&lt;ref name="thenation.com"&gt;[http://www.thenation.com/article/protest-patronage?page=0,3 Randall Kennedy, "From Protest to Patronage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104194411/http://www.thenation.com/article/protest-patronage?page=0%2C3 |date=January 4, 2016 }}, ''The Nation,'' 11 Sept 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

''Commentary'' editor-in-chief [[Norman Podhoretz]] had commissioned the article from Rustin, and the two men remained intellectually and personally aligned for the next 20 years. Podhoretz and the magazine promoted the [[neoconservative]] movement, which had implications for civil rights initiatives as well as other economic aspects of the society. In 1985, Rustin publicly praised Podhoretz for his refusal to "pander to minority groups" and for opposing affirmative action quotas in hiring as well as black studies programs in colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/21/specials/podhoretz-25years.html Walter Goodman, "Podhoretz on 25 Years at Commentary"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305093450/http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/21/specials/podhoretz-25years.html |date=March 5, 2016 }}, ''The New York Times,'' 31 January 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of these positions, Rustin was criticized as a "sell-out" by many of his former colleagues in the civil rights movement, especially those connected to [[grassroots organizing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gBH5GRFw-fkC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=bayard.+sell+out.+grassroots&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=aR5Dykb4ab&amp;sig=hlwOK0fzT3eip3JYWwoXS4-sGGE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwilvY6-jN7YAhUN7lMKHXd8CgoQ6AEwBHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bayard.%20sell%20out.%20grassroots&amp;f=false|title=Bayard Rustin: American Dreamer|last=Podair|first=Jerald|date=2008-12-16|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers|year=|isbn=9780742564800|location=|pages=64, 77|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They charged that he was lured by the material comforts that came with a less radical and more professional type of activism. While biographer [[John D'Emilio]] rejects these characterizations, Randall Kennedy wrote in a 2003 article that descriptions of Rustin as "a bought man" are "at least partly true." &lt;ref name="thenation.com"/&gt;

===Labor movement: Unions and social democracy===
Rustin increasingly worked to strengthen the labor movement, which he saw as the champion of empowerment for the African-American community and for economic justice for all Americans. He contributed to the labor movement's two sides, economic and political, through support of labor unions and social-democratic politics.
He was the founder and became the Director of the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], which coordinated the AFL-CIO's work on civil rights and economic justice. He became a regular columnist for the AFL-CIO newspaper.

On the political side of the labor movement, Rustin increased his visibility as a leader of the American [[social democracy]]. In early 1972, he became a national co-chairman of the Socialist Party of America. In December 1972, when the Socialist Party changed its name to [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) by a vote of 73–34, Rustin continued to serve as national co-chairman, along with [[Charles S. Zimmerman]] of the [[International Ladies Garment Workers' Union]] (ILGWU).&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/12/31/archives/socialist-party-now-the-social-democrats-usa.html |title=Socialist Party Now the Social Democrats, U.S.A.|date=December 31, 1972 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=February 8, 2010}} (limited free access)&lt;/ref&gt; In his opening speech to the December 1972 Convention, Co-Chairman Rustin called for SDUSA to organize against the "reactionary policies of the Nixon Administration"; Rustin also criticized the "irresponsibility and élitism of the 'New Politics' liberals".&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt; In later years, Rustin served as the national chairman of SDUSA.

During the 1960s, Rustin was a member&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Forman|first1=James|title=The Making of Black Revolutionaries|date=1972|publisher=University of Washington Press|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[League for Industrial Democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Clayborne|title=In Struggle: SNCC and the Black Awakening of the 1960s|date=1981|publisher=[[Harvard University]] Press|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would remain a member for years, and became vice president during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/WorkersRightsEastAndWestAComparativeStudyOfTradeUnionAnd|last1=Karatnycky|first1=Adrian|last2=Motyl|first2=Alexander J.|last3=Sturmthal|first3=Adolph|title=Workers' rights, East and West : a comparative study of trade union and workers' rights in Western democracies and Eastern Europe |date=1980|publisher=Transaction Publishing / [[League for Industrial Democracy]]|pages=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
Like many liberals and socialists, Rustin supported President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s [[containment policy]] against [[Soviet communism|communism]], while criticizing specific conduct of this policy. In particular, to maintain independent labor unions and political opposition in [[Vietnam]], Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the [[Vietnam War]], while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being "angered and humiliated by the kind of war being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages."&lt;ref&gt;Rustin 2012, pp. 291-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Allard Lowenstein]] and [[Norman Thomas]], Rustin worked with the [[CIA]]-sponsored Committee on Free Elections in the Dominican Republic, which lent international credibility to a 1966 ballot effectively rigged against the socialist former president, [[Juan Bosch (politician)|Juan Bosch]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 Nathan Glazer "A Word From Our Sponsor: Review of Hugh Wilford's The Mighty Wurlitzer" ''The New York Times'', January 20, 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909023200/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/books/review/Glazer-t.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 |date=September 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin worked as a human rights and [[Election monitoring|election monitor]] for [[Freedom House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=249|title=Freedom House: A History|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823010319/http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=249|archivedate=2011-08-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Rustin called for the U.S. to send military jets in the fight against [[Arab states]] by Israel; referring to a New York Times article he authored, Rustin wrote to Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]] "...I hope that the ad will also have an effect on a serious domestic question: namely, the relations between the Jewish and the Negro communities in America." Rustin was concerned about unity between two groups that he argued faced discrimination in America and abroad, and also believed that Israel's democratic ideals were proof that justice and equality would prevail in the Arab territories despite the atrocities of war. His former colleagues in the peace movement considered it to be a profound betrayal of Rustin's nonviolent ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forusa.org/fellowship/2013/summer/book-review-i-must-resist/12390 Matthew Arlyck "Review of I Must Resist: Letters of Bayard Rustin" Fellowship of Reconciliation website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419182230/http://forusa.org/fellowship/2013/summer/book-review-i-must-resist/12390 |date=April 19, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustin maintained his strongly anti-Soviet and anti-communist views later in his life, especially with regard to Africa. Rustin co-wrote with [[Carl Gershman]] (a former director of [[Social Democrats, USA]] and future [[Ronald Reagan]] appointee) an essay entitled "Africa, Soviet Imperialism &amp; the Retreat of American Power," in which he decried Russian and Cuban involvement in the [[Angolan Civil War]] and defended the military intervention by [[apartheid South Africa]] on behalf of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]] (FNLA) and National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ([[UNITA]]). "And if a South African force did intervene at the urging of ''black'' leaders and on the side of the forces that clearly represent the ''black'' majority in Angola, to counter a non-African army of Cubans ten times its size, by what standard of political judgment is this immoral?" Rustin accused the Soviet Union of a classic imperialist agenda in Africa in pursuit of economic resources and vital sea lanes, and called the [[Carter Administration]] "hypocritical" for claiming to be committed to the welfare of blacks while doing too little to thwart Russian and Cuban expansion throughout Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/download/AfricaSovietImperialismAndTheRetreatOfAmericanPower/SDP2.pdf |title=Africa, Soviet Imperialism &amp; The Retreat Of American Power |publisher=Social Democrats, U.S.A.|author=Bayard Rustin and Carl Gershman |date=October 1977|accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, Rustin helped found the [[Committee on the Present Danger]] (CPD) with Paul Nitze, leader of the CIAs [[Team B]] project. CPD promoted Team B's controversial intelligence claims about Soviet foreign policy, using them as an argument against arms control agreements such as [[SALT II]]. This cemented Rustin's leading role in the neoconservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_JX04sBnEWUC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=committee+on+the+present+danger+members,+rustin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=McPgDKvLmg&amp;sig=XNcW-pyaNXbU4KoEwBa57v54vl4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viQcVfa_LYqSsQS0l4CYCw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bayard%20rustin&amp;f=false John Ehrman, The Rise of Neoconservatism: Intellectuals and Foreign Affairs, 1945-1994 (Yale University Press, 1996), p. 107-114] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610060721/https://books.google.com/books?id=_JX04sBnEWUC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=committee+on+the+present+danger+members%2C+rustin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=McPgDKvLmg&amp;sig=XNcW-pyaNXbU4KoEwBa57v54vl4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=viQcVfa_LYqSsQS0l4CYCw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCQ |date=June 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet Jewry movement ===
{{Main article|Soviet Jewry Movement}}
The plight of Jews in the Soviet Union reminded Rustin of the struggles that blacks faced in the United States. Soviet Jews faced many of the same forms of discrimination in employment, education and housing, while also being prisoners within their own country by being denied the chance to emigrate by Soviet authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Podair, Jerald E. "Bayard Rustin: American Dreamer" (Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Pub., 2009). {{ISBN|074254513X}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the injustice that Soviet Jews faced, Rustin became a leading voice in advocating for the movement of Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel. He worked closely with Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, who introduced legislation that tied trade relations with the Soviet Union to their treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Podair 2009, pp. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 he chaired the historic Ad hoc Commission on Rights of Soviet Jews organized by the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, leading a panel of six jurors in the Commission’s public tribunal on Jewish life in the Soviet Union. Members of the panel included [[Telford Taylor]], the Nuremberg war trial prosecutor and Columbia University professor of law; Dr. John C. Bennett, president of the Union Theological Seminary; Reverend George B. Ford, pastor emeritus of the Corpus Christi Church; Samuel Fishman representing United Automobile Workers; and Norman Thomas, veteran Socialist leader.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1966/12/05/archive/commission-to-present-findings-on-soviet-jewry-to-u-n|title=Commission to Present Findings on Soviet Jewry to U.N.|date=1966-12-05|website=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|access-date=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission collected testimonies from Soviet Jews and compiled them into a report that was delivered to the secretary general of the United Nations. The report urged the international community to demand that the Soviet authorities allow Jews to practice their religion, preserve their culture and to emigrate from the USSR at their will.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The testimonies from Soviet Jews were published by [[Moshe Decter]], the executive secretary of the Conference on the Status of Soviet Jews, in a book— ''Redemption! Jewish freedom letters from Russia'', with a foreword by Rustin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Redemption! Jewish freedom letters from Russia|last=Decter|first=Moshe|publisher=American Jewish Conference on Soviet Jewry|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=2–3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s and 1980s Rustin wrote several articles on the subject of Soviet Jewry and appeared at Soviet Jewry movement rallies, demonstrations, vigils, and conferences, in the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shared Dreams: Martin Luther King, Jr. &amp; the Jewish Community|last=Shneier|first=Marc|publisher=Jewish Lights|year=2008|isbn=1580232736|location=New York|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He co-sponsored the National Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry. Rustin allied with Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], an outspoken advocate for Soviet Jewry, and worked closely with Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Jackson]], informing the [[Jackson–Vanik amendment]]—a vital legislation that restricted United States trade with the Soviet Union in relation to its treatment of Jews.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Gay rights===

He also testified on behalf of New York State's Gay Rights Bill. In 1986, he gave a speech "The New Niggers Are Gays," in which he asserted,

{{quote|text=Today, blacks are no longer the litmus paper or the barometer of social change. Blacks are in every segment of society and there are laws that help to protect them from racial discrimination. The new "niggers" are gays.... It is in this sense that gay people are the new barometer for social change.... The question of social change should be framed with the most vulnerable group in mind: gay people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gays Are the New Niggers |url=http://killingthebuddha.com/mag/damnation/gays-are-the-new-niggers/ |date=June 26, 2009 |author=Osagyefo Uhuru Sekou |publisher=Killing the Buddha |accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While there is a recurring tendency to describe Rustin as a pioneering "out gay man" the truth is more complex. In 1986, Rustin was invited to contribute to the book ''In the Life: A Black Gay Anthology''. He declined, explaining

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was not involved in the struggle for gay rights as a youth. ...I did not "come out of the closet" voluntarily—circumstances forced me out. While I have no problem with being publicly identified as homosexual, it would be dishonest of me to present myself as one who was in the forefront of the struggle for gay rights. ...I fundamentally consider sexual orientation to be a private matter. As such, it has not been a factor which has greatly influenced my role as an activist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Bayard-Rustin-A-complex-legacy/36990.html Yasmin Nair, "Bayard Rustin: A complex legacy" Windy City Times, March 3, 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414212310/http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Bayard-Rustin-A-complex-legacy/36990.html |date=April 14, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rustin did not engage in any gay rights activism until the 1980s. He was urged to do so by his partner [[Walter Naegle]], who has said that "I think that if I hadn't been in the office at that time, when these invitations [from gay organizations] came in, he probably wouldn't have done them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016235132/https://books.google.com/books?id=C1xJ5ONWltYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bayard+rustin,+gay,+book,+voluntarily,+closet|title=Lost Prophet: The Life and Times of Bayard Rustin - John D'Emilio - Google Книги|author=|date=16 October 2015|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the lack of marriage equality at the time Rustin and partner Walter Naegle took an unconventional step to solidify their partnership and protect their unification. In 1982 Rustin adopted Naegle, 30 years old at the time, in order to legalize their union. Naegle explains, &lt;blockquote&gt;We actually had to go through a process as if Bayard was adopting a small child. My biological mother had to sign a legal paper, a paper disowning me. They had to send a social worker to our home. When the social worker arrived, she had to sit us down to talk to us to make sure that this was a fit home.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Long Before Same-Sex Marriage, 'Adopted Son' Could Mean 'Life Partner'|url = https://www.npr.org/2015/06/28/418187875/long-before-same-sex-marriage-adopted-son-could-mean-life-partner|website = NPR.org|accessdate = 2015-11-16|first = Weekend Edition|last = Sunday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Davis Platt, Bayard's partner from the 1940s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/news-opinion/2013/08/28/bayard-rustin-walter-naegle-partner-gay-civil-rights-activist-march-washington |title=The Personal Life of Bayard Rustin |first=Robert |last=Drayton |date=January 18, 2016 |work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; said "I never had any sense at all that Bayard felt any shame or guilt about his homosexuality.

==Death and beliefs==
[[File:Bayard Rustin before demonstration NYWTS.jpg|thumb|250px|Rustin speaks with civil rights activists before a demonstration, 1964]]
Rustin died on August 24, 1987, of a perforated [[vermiform appendix|appendix]]. An obituary in ''The New York Times'' reported, "Looking back at his career, Mr. Rustin, a [[Quaker]], once wrote: 'The principal factors which influenced my life are 1) nonviolent tactics; 2) constitutional means; 3) democratic procedures; 4) respect for human personality; 5) a belief that all people are one.'

President [[Ronald Reagan]] issued a statement on Rustin's death, praising his work for civil rights and "for human rights throughout the world." He added that Rustin "was denounced by former friends, because he never gave up his conviction that minorities in America could and would succeed based on their individual merit."&lt;ref name="apnewsarchive.com"/&gt;

Rustin "faded from the shortlist of well-known civil rights lions," in part because he was active behind the scenes, and also because of public discomfort with his sexual orientation and former communist membership.&lt;ref name="WP-20110821"/&gt; In addition, Rustin's tilt toward neo-conservatism in the late 1960s led him into disagreement with most civil rights leaders. But, the 2003 documentary film ''Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin'', a [[Sundance Festival]] Grand Jury Prize nominee,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rustin.org|title=Brother Outsider&amp;nbsp;– Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the March 2012 centennial of Rustin's birth have contributed to renewed recognition of his extensive contributions.

Rustin served as chairman of [[Social Democrats, USA]], which, ''The Washington Post'' wrote in 2013, "was a breeding ground for many [[Neoconservatism|neoconservatives]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/28/meet-the-gay-socialist-pacifist-who-planned-the-1963-march-on-washington/ Dylan Matthews, "Meet Bayard Rustin"], Washingtonpost.com, 28 Aug 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, he was among the second-age neoconservatives, and in 1979, was elevated to vice-chair of the [[Coalition for a Democratic Majority]], an organization that helped revive the [[Committee on the Present Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3b7syYOqskC&amp;q=bayard#v=snippet&amp;q=bayard%20rustin&amp;f=false Justin Vaïsse, Neoconservatism: The Biography of a Movement (Harvard University Press, 2010), p. 91] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913115837/https://books.google.com/books?id=z3b7syYOqskC&amp;q=bayard#v=snippet&amp;q=bayard%20rustin&amp;f=false |date=September 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/articles/display/Coalition_for_a_Democratic_Majority "Coalition for a Democratic Majority"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083456/http://www.rightweb.irc-online.org/articles/display/Coalition_for_a_Democratic_Majority |date=March 4, 2016 }}, Right Web, Institute for Policy Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Daniel Richman, former clerk for [[United States Supreme Court]] justice [[Thurgood Marshall]], Marshall's friendship with Rustin, who was open about his homosexuality, played a significant role in Marshall's dissent from the court's 5–4 decision upholding the constitutionality of state sodomy laws in the [[Lawrence v. Texas|later overturned]] 1986 case ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]].''&lt;ref name="MurdochPrice2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Murdoch|first1=Joyce|last2=Price|first2=Deb|title=Courting Justice: Gay Men and Lesbians v.

Several buildings have been named in honor of Rustin, including the [[Bayard Rustin Educational Complex]] located in [[Chelsea, Manhattan]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://insideschools.org/index12.php?fs=91&amp;str=H.S.%20440%20Bayard%20Rustin%20Educati...&amp;formtype=name "H.S. 440 Bayard Rustin Educational Complex"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401143311/http://insideschools.org/index12.php?fs=91&amp;str=H.S.%20440%20Bayard%20Rustin%20Educati...&amp;formtype=name |date=April 1, 2016 }} at InsideSchools.org&lt;/ref&gt; Bayard [[Rustin High School]] in his hometown of West Chester, Pennsylvania; Bayard Rustin Library at the Affirmations Gay/Lesbian Community Center in [[Ferndale, Michigan]]; and the Bayard Rustin Social Justice Center in [[Conway, Arkansas]]. Rustin is one of two men who have both participated in the [[Penn Relays]] and had a school, [[West Chester Rustin High School]], named in his honor that participates in the Relays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoover |first=Brett |date=2016 |title=What's in a name |url=http://news.pennrelaysonline.com/about-2/whats-in-a-name/ |newspaper=pennrelaysonline |location=63rd school listed on page |access-date=29 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2007, with the permission of the Estate of Bayard Rustin, a group of San Francisco Bay Area African-American LGBT community leaders officially formed the Bayard Rustin LGBT Coalition (BRC), to promote greater participation in the electoral process, advance civil and human rights issues, and promote the legacy of Rustin. In addition, the Bayard Rustin Center for LGBTQA Activism, Awareness and Reconciliation is located at [[Guilford College]], a Quaker school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Bayard-Rustin-Center-for-Lgbtqa-Activism-Education-and-Reconciliation/178474272198950 |title=The Bayard Rustin Center for Lgbtqa Activism, Education and Reconciliation&amp;nbsp;– Community&amp;nbsp;– Greensboro |publisher=Facebook |date=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly the Queer and Allied Resource Center, the center was rededicated in March 2011 with the permission of the Estate of Bayard Rustin and featured a keynote address by social justice activist [[Mandy Carter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guilford.edu/about_guilford/news_and_publications/releases/brc_opening.html |title=Bayard Rustin Center for LGBTQA Activism, Awareness and Reconciliation to Be Dedicated March 16 |publisher=[[Guilford College]] }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1998 anthology movie, ''Out of the Past'', featured letters and archive footage of Rustin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0141699/|title=Out of the Past (1998)|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker is placed at Lincoln and Montgomery Avenues, West Chester, Pennsylvania; the marker commemorating his accomplishments lies on the grounds of Henderson High School, which he attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=8243 |title=Bayard Rustin Marker |publisher=Hmdb.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Rustin was inducted into the [[Legacy Walk]], an outdoor public display which celebrates [[LGBT]] history and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legacyprojectchicago.org/2012_INDUCTEES.html |title=2012 Inductees |publisher=The Legacy Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustin was posthumously awarded honorary membership into Delta Phi Upsilon, a [[fraternity]] for gay, bisexual and progressive men.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

In 2013, Rustin was selected as an honoree in the [[Labor Hall of Honor|United States Department of Labor Hall of Honor]].&lt;ref name=HoH&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Honor Inductee, Bayard Rustin|url=http://www.dol.gov/dol/aboutdol/hallofhonor/2013_rustin.htm|website=The Department of Labor's Hall of Honor|publisher=United States Department of Labor|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 8, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] announced that he would posthumously award Rustin the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], the highest award in the United States. The citation in the press release stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bayard Rustin was an unyielding activist for civil rights, dignity, and equality for all. An advisor to the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., he promoted nonviolent resistance, participated in one of the first Freedom Rides, organized the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and fought tirelessly for marginalized communities at home and abroad. As an openly gay African American, Mr. Rustin stood at the intersection of several of the fights for equal rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/08/08/president-obama-names-presidential-medal-freedom-recipients|title=President Obama Names Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary, The White House|date=August 8, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the [[White House]] ceremony on November 20, 2013, President Obama presented Rustin's award to Walter Naegle, his partner of 10 years at the time of Rustin's death.&lt;ref name="metroweekly1"/&gt;

In 2016, the Greensboro Mural Project, created a mural in honor of Bayard Rustin located at New Garden Friends Meeting in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greensboromuralproject.com|title=The Greensboro Mural Project|author=|date=|website=The Greensboro Mural Project|accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hunter designed the mural, their first, honoring the legacy of Bayard Rustin.

On April 12, 2018, the [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] [[Montgomery County Public Schools (Maryland)|Board of Education]] in Maryland voted to name the [[Bayard Rustin Elementary School]] after Rustin.

'''The British Accreditation Council for Independent Further and Higher Education''' was established in 1984 to provide quality assurance for independent further and higher education in the UK. BAC accreditation is recognised as the clearest mark of educational quality in the private sector.{{fact|date=January 2017}} Alongside the British Council, whose Accreditation UK scheme serves as the definitive guide to the country’s English language centres, BAC has overseen the inspection of private post-16 education for over 30 years.

BAC encourages high standards of education offered by independent colleges and providing prospective students with a guide to quality. 

Its central office staff, a network of expert inspectors, and  consultants help independent education and training providers raise their standards.

BAC accreditation is recognised by the UK Visas &amp; Immigration (UKVI), part of the Home Office, as a qualifying requirement for institutions wishing to enrol students on Short-Term Study Visas: students from outside the EEA will only secure a UK Short-Term Study Visa if they have an offer from an accredited institution.

==Inspection and accreditation==
The British Accreditation Council inspects and accredits around 250 organisations within the UK and overseas.  An inspection of a private college assesses four main areas:

* Management, Staffing and Administration 
* Teaching, Learning and Assessment 
* Student Welfare 
* Premises and Facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-bac.org/sites/default/files/documents/BAC%20College%20Scheme_018841E.pdf |title=College Scheme Document |publisher=The-bac.org |accessdate=2014-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607054324/http://the-bac.org/sites/default/files/documents/BAC%20College%20Scheme_018841E.pdf |archivedate=7 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as private colleges such as [[Huron University USA in London|Hult International Business School]], the charity inspects training providers such as [[Crown Agents for Oversea Governments and Administrations Ltd|Crown Agents]]. In October 2012, it announced that it would also inspect and accredit online colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thepienews.com/news/bac-unveils-accreditaion-for-non-uk-institutions/ |title=International Education News l The PIE News l BAC unveils accreditation for non-UK institutions |publisher=Thepienews.com |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-UK colleges accredited by the organisation include, [[CITY College, International Faculty of the University of Sheffield|City College (international faculty of the University of Sheffield)]], AKMI Athens Metropolitan College, AKTO (Art &amp; Design), American University of Culture &amp; Education (AUCE), BCA (Business College Athens), HTMi, Hotel &amp; Tourism Management Institute, IMI University Centre, Independent Science &amp; Technology (IST) Studies, International University College, Sofia, Mediterranean College - Athens, Mediterranean College - Thessaloniki, New York College, Athens-SBS, New York College, Thessaloniki, Rushmore Business School, University of New York in Prague and VUZF University. Until October 2012, colleges outside the UK were only eligible for BAC accreditation if they offered [[higher education]] courses and had a formal validation agreement or other link with a UK higher education institution, [[United Kingdom Awarding Bodies|awarding body]] or BAC-accredited college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-bac.org/accreditation/international/IHEI |title=International higher education accreditation |publisher=BAC |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810020609/http://the-bac.org/accreditation/international/IHEI |archivedate=10 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012, a new accreditation scheme was launched for certain overseas institutions that did not meet these criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hothousemedia.com/yourworld/news/121011-BAC-launches-new.html |title=BAC launches new accreditation schemes |publisher=Hothousemedia.com |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspection reports are considered by the Accreditation Committee, which includes representatives from the British Council and the Council of Validating Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-bac.org/about/governance/ac |title=Accreditation Committee |publisher=BAC |date= |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810071112/http://the-bac.org/about/governance/ac |archivedate=10 August 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Association for Applied Linguistics''' ('''BAAL''') is an [[academia|academic]] society for professional [[applied linguistics|applied linguists]], [[language]] [[teaching|teachers]] and other interested parties, based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is an affiliate of the ''Association Internationale de Linguistique Appliquee'' ([[International Association of Applied Linguistics]], AILA).

BAAL organises regular meetings of its approximately 1000 members at various venues in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;''British Association for Applied Linguistics'': '[http://www.baal.org.uk]'. 11 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; publishes conference proceedings, issues a regular newsletter and awards student [[scholarship]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''British h. for Applied Linguistics'': '[http://www.baal.org.uk/join_funding.htm Funding Opportunities] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704160059/http://www.baal.org.uk/join_funding.htm |date=4 July 2007 }}'. 29 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The current Chair (2018-2021) is Dawn Knight, Reader in the School of English, Communication and Philosophy at [[Cardiff University]].

BAAL's Annual Meeting is held every year in early September in the UK; the 50th BAAL conference was held in 2017, at the [[University of Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;''British Association for Applied Linguistics'': '[http://www.baal.org.uk/confs.htm Conferences] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071109065330/http://www.baal.org.uk/confs.htm |date=9 November 2007 }}'. 27 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives also attend international conferences. BAAL is a registered charity in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;''British Association for Applied Linguistics'': '[http://www.baal.org.uk/about.htm About BAAL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613180146/http://www.baal.org.uk/about.htm |date=13 June 2007 }}'. 4 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings usually have a theme; for example, the 40th conference at the [[University of Edinburgh]] focused on 'Technology, Ideology and Practice in Applied Linguistics'.&lt;ref&gt;''British Association for Applied Linguistics'': '[http://www.baal.org.uk/conf2007/index.htm 40th Annual Meeting of the British Association for Applied Linguistics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070917094108/http://www.baal.org.uk/conf2007/index.htm |date=17 September 2007 }}'. 5 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association is regularly consulted over linguistic issues and language teaching in the UK,&lt;ref&gt;''British Association for Applied Linguistics'': '[http://www.baal.org.uk/join.htm Joining BAAL] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613175446/http://www.baal.org.uk/join.htm |date=13 June 2007 }}'. 2 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but has stopped short of active [[politics|political]] lobbying; it remains a primarily academic institution, despite occasional forays into campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;British Association for Applied Linguistics (1997: 12-14).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The association first convened in the 1960s, as interest increased in the new science of modern [[linguistics]] and particularly in its practical application - for example, in [[language acquisition|language teaching and learning]]. A group of theoretical linguists, educators and other professionals using language "as a tool" would establish much-need cross-disciplinary contacts; also, deepening [[European Union|European integration]] at the time meant that there was a need for high-quality language teaching across the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Trim (1988: 7-8).&lt;/ref&gt; 

BAAL's creation was the result of a proposal by Peter Strevens, Chair in Applied Linguistics at the [[University of Essex]]. At a preliminary meeting of interested parties at [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] in July 1965, a narrower remit was discussed than the wider set of issues that the Association would concern itself with; initially, it was suggested that it might focus on language teaching and [[machine translation]], but the first full meeting in 1967 in [[Reading, Berkshire]] agreed to broaden the scope. BAAL emerged as the UK affiliate of AILA, with [[Pit Corder]] its first Chair. Membership was narrowly defined in the early years, as BAAL wished to develop a reputation as a learned society rather than a teachers' meeting; however, a feeling that the Association could afford to widen recruitment was apparent by the early 1970s. In 1985, a requirement for formal qualifications, already flexible, was dropped; and today anyone can join. In 1980, the Association also began to publish what is now considered the leading journal in the field, ''[[Applied Linguistics (journal) | Applied Linguistics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;British Association for Applied Linguistics (1997: 4-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See ''[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/applij/about.html Applied Linguistics - About the Journal]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Children-404''' is a Russian [[LGBTI]] online community on [[Facebook]] and on the social networking site [[VK (social networking)|VK]].

The establisher of the community is Lena Klimova, a journalist based in the city of [[Nizhny Tagil]]. She is the author of a series of articles on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) teenagers and she published in 2014 a book on the topic. In 2013, she set up an online community on Facebook and on the social networking site VK named Children-404, which provides a space for teenagers to discuss LGBTI issues and support each other.

==Objectives==
The Project’s [[Facebook]] and [[VK (social networking)|VK]] pages (entitled “Children-404”) publish letters from Russian LGBT teenagers in which they talk about the problems they face in their lives due to homophobic people around them - friends, relatives, classmates, teachers, and others. The Project’s pages also publishes letters from adults with words of support for the Russian LGBT adolescents.

The number "404" in the project title refers to the internet error message "[[HTTP 404|Error 404 - Page not found]]".&lt;ref name="WP-Russian law"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/russias-gay-law-isolates-lgbt-teenagers/2013/09/01/9eec54fc-0c19-11e3-89fe-abb4a5067014_story.html|title=Russian law isolates gay teenagers|author=Kathy Lally.|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2013-09-02|accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project authors draw attention to the fact that in Russian society not many people consider the existence of gay and transgender children and the challenges that they face in an LGBT-intolerant environment. The Project description states:

{{quotation|Our society believes that gay teenagers do not exist in nature, as if gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people arrive from Mars as adults. Meanwhile, one family in twenty has an LGBT-child in it, and those children are society’s invisible "Children-404".}}

==Inception==

Lena Klimova, a young journalist from [[Ekaterinburg]], published a series of articles critical of the parliamentary bills against “propaganda of homosexuality”. Afterwards she received an e-mail from a 15-year-old girl who said that she was being bullied by her classmates and her parents because of her homosexuality. The girl wrote that had been on the verge of suicide, but Klimova’s article had made her change her mind.

After that Klimova started to research the lives of LGBT adolescents in Russia, and created an online survey. Within under two weeks Klimova had received over a hundred e-mail responses, and that is what made her resolve to create an online support project for LGBT teens.&lt;ref name="WP-Russian law" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lenta.ru/articles/2013/06/04/gaykids/|title=Этот закон убьет какое-то количество детей|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|author=Кирилл Артёменко.|date=2013-06-04|accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project consists of two parts: a private "closed" group on the Russian social network [[VK (social networking)|VK]], whose purpose is to offer psychological assistance to LGBT teens, and in which they can share their problems and get help from adult participants; and open  projects on [[Facebook]] and [[VK (social networking)|VK]] which publish letters from teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bok-o-bok.ru/opinion.asp?pid=28&amp;lan=2&amp;tid=941|title="Всё изменится к лучшему.

The popular Spanish newspaper [[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] wrote the following about the "Children-404" Project in an article entitled "How dangerous to be homosexual in Russia", writes: "The photos show young faces whose eyes are concealed by placards with the inscription "Children-404". In numerous letters teens shout “We exist!” in protest against widespread intolerance".&lt;ref name="Elmundo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2013/08/11/internacional/1376242552.html|title=El riesgo de ser homosexual en Rusia|publisher=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=2013-08-11|accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The "Children-404" Project has attracted attention outside Russia. In summer and early autumn of 2013 in a number of cities in the world - [[New York City]], [[Oslo]], [[London]] - public rallies were held in support of the Russian LGBT adolescents and the "Children-404" Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metroland.net/2013/08/07/calling-moscow/

On 16 July 2013 six members of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland]], ([[Anna Grodzka]], Andrzej Rozenek, [[Robert Biedroń]], Tomasz Makovski, Maciej Banaszak, and Michał Kabaciński), members of the [[Palikot's Movement]], held a rally in support of Russian LGBT teens. They were photographed with posters saying "Children-404, you exist! We are with you!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/social/news/2013/07/16/n_3045753.shtml

On 5 December 2013, in partnership with Children-404, the U.S. [[It Gets Better Project]] launched a campaign entitled "You are beautiful!" on its website to support Russian LGBT teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/it-gets-better-project-launches-in-russia-to-counter-anti-lgbt-laws-1200922140/

In January 2014, Elena Klimova was charged under a Russian federal law criminalizing the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law|distribution of "propaganda" of "non-traditional sexual relationships" among minors]]. On 21 February 2014, the charges were dropped after the court ruled in consultation with a mental health professional that the page "helps teenagers exploring their sexuality to deal with difficult emotional issues and other problems that they may encounter", and did not constitute "propaganda" under the law. [[Vitaly Milonov]], a member of the [[Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg]] who was in favor of the law, intended to appeal the decision.&lt;ref name="Guardian - Gay Russian teens" /&gt;&lt;ref name=amnesty-children404&gt;{{cite web|title=Russian journalist accused of anti-gay "propaganda" defeats charges|url=http://www.amnesty.ca/our-work/good-news/russian-journalist-accused-of-anti-gay-propaganda-defeats-charges|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=23 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, Klimova was, again, charged with violating the propaganda law for operating Children-404, facing a fine of 50,000 rubles. The charges were dropped by a [[Nizhny Tagil]] court after an appeal. However, in July 2015, Klimova was charged once more and convicted by the same court for violating the law, facing the same fine. Klimova intended to appeal.&lt;ref name=guardian-404fine&gt;{{cite news|title=LGBT website founder fined under Russia's gay propaganda laws|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/29/lgbt-yelena-klimova-fined-russia-gay-propaganda-laws|accessdate=9 September 2015|work=The Guardian|date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions==

* In June 2013 [[Yelena Mizulina]], Deputy in the Russian [[State Duma]] and author of the federal law banning "propaganda of non-traditional relationships", in an interview to [[Gazeta.ru]], said that the "Children-404" Project does not constitute "propaganda":

{{quotation|1=''Do you know about the “Children 404” Project?''

Mizulina: No, I don’t.

''This is a site where children with a non-traditional orientation send their stories, talk about how they live. I beg you to look at this site before the bill is passed at second reading.''

Mizulina: Such a project is not concerned with the propaganda of non-traditional relationships.

''What is it like for these children when they discover that they are not like everyone else? How do they get information that it is not a disease, that it's okay?''

Mizulina: Information that is explanatory, or descriptive, or which does not call for anything, which is not provocative, which doesn’t depict non-traditional sexual relations, is not propaganda, it can be legally accessed by teens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2013/06/10_a_5375845.shtml

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15129">'''Climate Change Education''' (CCE) is learning geared toward helping people address and develop effective responses to [[climate change]]. It helps learners understand the causes and consequences of climate change, prepares them to live with the impacts of climate change and empowers learners to take appropriate actions to adopt more sustainable lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233083e.pdf|title=Not Just Hot Air: Putting Climate Change Education into Practice|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100101-7|location=|pages=6, 8, 10, 32, 40, 44, 46, 48, 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CCE helps policy-makers understand the urgency and importance of putting mechanisms into place to combat climate change on a national and global scale. Communities learn about how climate change will affect them, what they can do to protect themselves from negative consequences, and how they can reduce their own [[climate footprint]]. In particular, CCE helps increase the resilience of already vulnerable communities who are the most likely to be adversely affected by climate change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

CCE is rooted in [[Education for sustainable development|Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== UNESCO Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme ==
Established in 2010, the [[UNESCO]] Climate Change Education for Sustainable Development programme (CCESD) aims to help people understand climate change by expanding CCE activities in [[Nonformal learning|nonformal education]] through the media, networking and partnerships. It is grounded in the holistic approach of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) which incorporates key sustainable development issues such as climate change, [[disaster risk reduction]] and others into education, in a way that addresses the interdependence of environmental sustainability, economic viability and social justice. It promotes participatory teaching and learning methods that motivate and empower learners to change their behaviour and take action for sustainable development. The programme seeks to help people understand the impact of global warming today and increase ‘climate literacy’, especially among young people, and aims to make education a more central part of the international response to climate change. UNESCO works with national governments to integrate CCE into national [[Curriculum|curricula]] and to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches for doing so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Selected country profiles regarding CCE and ESD ==

=== Australia ===
Australia has been at the forefront of [[Education for sustainable development|education for sustainability]], adopting in 2000 a national plan entitled Environmental Education for a Sustainable Future. A number of initiatives and bodies were created to implement the national plan, including the Australian Sustainable Schools Initiative and [[Australian Research Institute for Environment and Sustainability]]. These provided a strong foundation for Australia’s strategy, launched in 2006, to respond to the [[Education for sustainable development#United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development .28DESD.29|UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development]]. The strategy set out the goal to mainstream sustainability through a holistic approach that engages the community through education and [[lifelong learning]]. Whereas climate change was referred to as one of a number of environmental concerns in the first national plan, a new plan launched in 2009, entitled Living Sustainably: the Australian Government’s National Action Plan for Education for Sustainability, had a greater focus on climate change and its impacts on other natural resources within a wider global context. The new plan incorporated climate change within education for sustainability, rather than establishing a new and potentially competing field of Climate Change Education. Australia introduced its first-ever national curriculum in 2014, including sustainability as one of three cross-curriculum subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since 2009, Climate Change Education has been most evident in the [[TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)|VET sector]]. [[Council of Australian Governments|COAG]] endorsed the Green Skills Agreement in 2009, and the Ministerial Council for Vocational and Technical Education published the National VET Sector Sustainability Policy and Action Plan (2009-2012). These initiatives aimed to provide workers with the skills needed to transition to a low-carbon economy and VET teachers with suitable training packages to promote education for sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== China ===
China introduced [[environmental education]] in the late 1970s as a result of increased attention to sustainable development and the need to protect the environment. Following the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), environmental education moved towards environment, population and development, and finally education for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Chinese government has produced a number of policy documents identifying environmental education and ESD as key to quality education. In 2003, the Ministry of Education issued the first guiding policy - the Guidelines for Implementing Environmental Education in Elementary and Secondary School - on environmental education in China. ESD was formally incorporated into the national education policy in 2010 in The National Education Outline 2010-2020, and further integrated in some local education policies. National climate change policies and plans in China refer to education but do not specifically address CCE. This has resulted in limited institutional support to date. There is no national ESD or CCE action plan or official policy to inform its implementation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In China, ESD mainly refers to providing individuals with the scientific knowledge, learning capacity, values and lifestyle choices to meet the country’s sustainable development objectives. CCE is most commonly implemented as a component of ESD. A number of educational approaches have been adopted to facilitate the implementation of ESD. These include integrating ESD values into school philosophy, [[curriculum development]], capacity-building of teachers and educators, ESD pedagogical approaches and ESD and CCE thematic activities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ESD is a component of compulsory education, but is limited in higher education, VET and adult education. The Ministry of Education has recently issued a guidance document that identified the VET sector in particular as needing to be reformed to meet the sustainable development objectives of the Chinese economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Denmark ===
Denmark and its neighbouring countries began working together in the 1990s to formulate a policy for ESD. While Denmark signed the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) declaration on ESD in 2005, it did not adopt a strategy until 2009, just before the half-way point of the DESD. The Ministry of Education, which was made responsible for the DESD, organised a consultation process on how to promote ESD before adopting its strategy in 2009.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The UN Climate Summit (COP15) held in Denmark in December 2009 provided the impetus to develop of a number of national ESD policy initiatives. A national strategy on ESD was developed with a substantial climate change component. The aim of the strategy is to make citizens more responsible for their actions by improving their scientific knowledge. The ESD strategy notes that climate change should not be the sole focus of ESD, though the concrete initiatives that are part of the strategy mostly support the CCE projects and activities that were part of COP15 preparations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A new national school curriculum adopted in 2009 included elements of ESD and CCE. The concept of sustainability was embedded in the goals describing the interrelationships between nature and society. CCE is mostly approached as teaching climate science, but it was also included in subjects such as geography and social studies, where the interrelationships between human behaviour, consumption and climate are examined.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There has been no explicit policy change in the TVET sector to upgrade skills to respond to climate change and environmental issues. However, it is important to note that the Danish TVET sector had previously reflected skills related to ecological modernisation in areas such as energy generation, [[waste management]] and agriculture. While the new government identified the economic and environmental climate change crises as important, education is only referred to in relation to the economic crisis. There is no mention of climate change or sustainability with regard to education, and the platform documentation on ‘green transition’ does not mention education. Overall, no policy strategy has been set to promote ESD, CCE, or the ‘greening’ of TVET as part of the government’s sustainable development and climate change policies. Government initiatives support NGO-led projects to raise community awareness of climate change. A national network on ESD was established with funding through to 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Dominican Republic ===
The Dominican Republic has taken a lead role in promoting ESD. Environmental education was made mandatory for all schools in 1998 and this has since evolved into ESD. In 2000, the General Law of Environment and Natural Resources changed the way environmental education was taught, moving from a subject matter to a cross-cutting and interdisciplinary theme. Risk management is also an important aspect of MINERD’s strategic plan, and has been integrated into the school curriculum as a cross-cutting subject. In 2004, the Environmental Education Strategy for Sustainable Development was adopted, which fosters formal and non-formal ESD. It is based on constructivism and uses a variety of pedagogical techniques that promote participatory learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ten-year 2008-2018 Education Plan (PDE) addresses the issue of quality education, including sustainable development and a culture of peace. It also established a process for periodic review of the curriculum. Climate change is also being introduced into the curriculum. The National Teacher Training Institute (INAFOCAM) and the Salomé Ureña Higher Institute for Teacher Training (ISFODOSU) provide support for environmental education through teacher training and curriculum support. The Ten-year 2008-2018 Higher Education Plan (PDES) includes environmental issues in the curricula and establishes a research programme to promote sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Dominican Republic has been involved in a number of ESD and CCE initiatives that have helped build local capacity, including:
* formal, non-formal and informal projects on ESD led by governmental agencies, civil society organizations, young leaders and local communities;
* UN: CC Learn Project, which supports the design and implementation of results-oriented and sustainable learning to address climate change (see the detailed case study in this Report);
* National Strategy to Strengthen Human Resource Capacities to Advance Green, Low Emission and Climate Resilient Development (ENDVBERC);
* teacher training supported by the UN: CC Learn-UNITAR, and the UNESCO-CCESD pilot programme.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== England ===
Environmental and development education have been present in England since the 1970s, when civil society organizations took the lead. From the late 1990s, the UK government promoted sustainable development and ESD at the local, regional and national levels. However, while a number of strategic government reports addressed CCE, government policy has focused less on ESD since 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2008 report Brighter Futures – Greener Lives: Sustainable Development Action Plan 2008-2010 outlined a number of specific initiatives related to Climate Change Education using an ESD approach. This included empowering youth with the skills, knowledge and freedom to voice their opinions and make a difference. The same year, CCE was introduced into the Key Stage Three (11 to 14 year-olds) geography curriculum.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The report Education for Sustainable Development in the UK 2010 noted that there were signs of substantial progress in embedding ESD-related policies and developing practices in the UK across a wide range of sectors in 2008 and 2009. For example, documents in 2009 highlighted the ‘Sustainable Schools’ project that aims to empower youth to cope with the future challenges facing the planet. The aim is for all schools to be ‘Sustainable Schools’ by 2020.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
The Republic of Korea has a number of policies and initiatives supporting environmental education. In 2008, the Environmental Education Promotion Act encouraged the development of environmental education. It aimed to raise national environmental awareness, to encourage people to develop research and inquiry skills, and to put what they learn into action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The Ministry of Environment, in its 2011-2015 Environmental Education Master Plan, proposed a policy agenda for environmental education to be implemented through formal education, social environmental education and educational infrastructure approaches. The various approaches in the formal education area include:
* ‘Environment and Green Growth’ as an elective subject in middle and high school curricula, and classes in elementary school designed to integrate environmental education; 
* the establishment of the Natural Environmental Studies Institute that o ers interactive youth programmes for environmental studies;
* Environment Model Schools, designed to demonstrate best-practice;
* ‘Low Carbon Challenge’ involving ten universities;
* in-service training for teachers to upskill, specializing in environmental education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Cognitive rigor''' is a combined model developed by superimposing two existing models for describing [[Rigour|rigor]] that are widely accepted in the [[Educators|education]] system in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="eric"&gt;Hess, K., Jones, B.S., Carlock, D., &amp; Walkup, J.R. (2009). Cognitive Rigor: Blending the strengths of Bloom's Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge to enhance classroom-level processes. [Technical Report]. Retrieved from ERIC database. (ED517804). http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED517804.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept "is marked and measured by the depth and extent students are challenged and engaged to demonstrate and communicate their knowledge and thinking" and also "marks and measures the depth and complexity of student learning experiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edge.ascd.org/blogpost/what-is-cognitive-rigor|title=ASCD EDge - What Is Cognitive Rigor?|website=edge.ascd.org|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognition|Cognitive]] Rigor is the superposition of [[Bloom's Taxonomy]] and [[Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge]] levels and is used to categorize the level of [[abstraction]] of questions and activities in education.  The Cognitive Rigor Matrix assists applying Cognitive Rigor in the classroom.&lt;ref name="eric" /&gt;  These models are intended for use in [[curriculum]] development and lesson planning so that students acquire the rigorous skills and knowledge needed for post-secondary education.&lt;ref name="eric" /&gt;

The idea of interlacing Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge to create a new tool for measuring curricular quality was completed in 2005 by Karin Hess of the [[National Center for Assessment in Higher Education|National Center for Assessment]], producing a 4 X 6 matrix (the Cognitive Rigor Matrix or Hess Matrix) for categorizing the Bloom’s Taxonomy and Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels for each activity or question appearing in curricular materials. The Cognitive Rigor Matrix aligns the six Bloom’s Taxonomy levels along the columns of the matrix and the four Webb's Depth-of-Knowledge levels along the rows.

Working independently, John Walkup and Ben Jones of The Standards Company LLC developed an identical matrix in 2007 and used it to measure the cognitive rigor of completed student work collected from two large-scale studies of the enacted curriculum in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="nevada"&gt;The Standards Company LLC. (2008a). “Study of the alignment of student assignments to the  academic standards in the state of Nevada pursuant to Senate Bill 184, Chap. 420, Statutes of  Nevada 2007.” Retrieved April 13, 2009, from Legislative Counsel Bureau, Nevada State Legislature, technical report, http://www.leg.state.nv.us/lcb/fiscal/Final_ReportCurriculum_Study.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oklahoma"&gt;The Standards Company LLC. (2008b). “Analysis of the enacted curriculum for the Oklahoma State Department of Education for the collection period February – March, 2008.” Oklahoma State Department of Education, unpublished technical report.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Hess, et al. published a paper defining Cognitive Rigor, describing how the model overcomes limitations of using Bloom's Taxonomy, and describing the model's use.&lt;ref name="eric"/&gt; The paper shows how Bloom's Taxonomy identifies processes (categorizes cognitive skills), and Webb's Depth of Knowledge shows quantification and application (focuses on depth of understanding and scope of content).  The combined models further the application of Bloom's Taxonomy to testing and assessment applications.  The Cognitive Rigor Matrix included in the article is often made available as a separate document, with example activities included in each cell of the matrix.&lt;ref name="static.pdesas"&gt;Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix and Curricular Examples: Applying Webb’s Depth-of-Knowledge Levels to Bloom’s Cognitive Process Dimensions – English Language Arts. http://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/M1-Slide_22_DOK_Hess_Cognitive_Rigor.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="static.pdesas_a"&gt;Hess' Cognitive Rigor Matrix and Curricular Examples: Applying Webb’s Depth-of-Knowledge Levels to Bloom’s Cognitive Process Dimensions – Mathematics and Science. http://static.pdesas.org/content/documents/M2-Activity_2_Handout.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium]] adopted the concept of Cognitive Rigor and the Hess Matrix in 2012 to measure the rigor of test items for the Next Generation of Assessments.&lt;ref name="sbac"&gt;Smarter Balanced Assessment Consortium. (April 2012). Mathematics Item Specifications Grades 3–5. {{cite web |url=http://www.smarterbalanced.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/TaskItemSpecifications/Mathematics/MathematicsGeneralItemandTaskSpecificationsGrades3-5.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105180923/http://www.smarterbalanced.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/TaskItemSpecifications/Mathematics/MathematicsGeneralItemandTaskSpecificationsGrades3-5.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Various educational organizations, including the [[Arizona Department of Education]], the [[New York City Department of Education]], [[Chicago Public Schools]], and most states currently use the Cognitive Rigor Matrix in training materials for their professional development.

[[File:DibujoPsicologoEducativo3.gif|thumb|320 px|right|Functions of educational psychologist]]

An '''educational psychologist''' is a [[psychologist]] whose differentiating functions may include diagnostic and psycho-educational [[Psychological evaluation|assessment]], [[psychological counseling]] in [[education]]al communities ([[students]], [[teachers]], [[parents]] and academic authorities), community-type psycho-educational intervention, and [[mediation]], coordination, and referral to other professionals, at all levels of the educational system. Many countries use this term to signify those who provide services to students, their teachers, and [[families]] while other countries use this term to signify academic expertise in teaching Educational Psychology.

==Specific facts==
[[Psychology]] is a so well developed discipline that allows different specializations: a) clinical and health psychology, b) work and organizational psychology, c) [[educational psychology]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, R. J. (2006). Educational psychology: The distinctive contribution. ''Educational Psychology in Practice'', 22, 289-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fagan, T. K., &amp; Wise, P. S. (Eds.). (2007).'' School psychology: Past, present and future (3rd ed.)''. Bethesda, MD: National Association of School Psychologists. {{ISBN|978-0-932955-71-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jimerson, S. R., Oakland, T. D., &amp; Farrel, P. T. (Eds.).(2007). ''The handbook of international school psychology.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. {{ISBN|978-1-4129-2669-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, R., &amp; Alexander, P. A. (Eds.) . (2010). ''Handbook of research on learning and instruction''. New York: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-80461-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, W. M., &amp; Miller, G. J. (Eds.).(2003). ''Handbook of psychology. Vol. 7: Educational Psychology.'' New Jersey: Wiley. {{ISBN|978-0-471-38406-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wittrock, M. C. (1992). «An empowering conception of educational psychology». ''Educational Psychologist, 27'', 129-141.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmerman, B. J., &amp; Schunk, D. H. (Eds.). (2003). ''Educational psychology: A century of contributions''. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-3682-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; What differentiates an educational psychologist from other psychologists or specialists is constituted by an academic triangle whose vertexes are represented by three categories: [[teachers]], [[students]] and [[curricula]] (see diagram). The use of plural in these three cases assumes two meanings: a) the traditional or official one and b) other more general derived from our information and knowledge society. The plural also indicates that nowadays we can no longer consider the average student or teacher, or a closed [[curriculum]], but the enormous variety found in our students, teachers and curricula. The triangle vertexes are connected by two-directional arrows, allowing four-fold typologies instead of the traditional two-way relationships (e.g., teacher-student).  In this way, we can find, in different educational contexts, groups of good teachers and students (excellent [[teaching/learning]] processes and products), groups of good teachers but bad students, and groups of bad teachers and good students, producing in both cases lower levels of academic achievements. In addition, we can find groups of bad teachers and bad students (school failure).
This specific work of an educational psychologist takes place in different contexts: micro-, meso- and macro-systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bonfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The ecology of human development: Experiments by nature and design.'' Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsystem (educational psychology)|Microsystem]]s refer to family contexts, where atmosphere, hidden curriculum, and expectations and behaviors of all family members determine, to a large extent, the educational development of each student.  The term [[mesosystem]] refers to all variety of contexts found in educational institutions, knowing that different variables such as geographical location, institution marketing or type of teachers and students, etc., can influence the academic results of students. [[Macrosystem]] has a much more general and global nature, leading us, for example, to consider the influence that the different societies or countries have on educational final products. One illustrative example of this level can be the analyses carried out on data gathered by the [[PISA]] reports. This approach would be the essence of educational psychology versus school psychology for many of U.S. educational researchers and for Division 15 of APA.

==Specific functions==
The most noteworthy function is, without a doubt, formal (rather than informal) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, M. W., Crosby, E. G., &amp; Pearson, J. L. (2001). Role of the school psychologist: Perceptions of school staff. ''School Psychology International, 22'', 64-73.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[evaluation]] involves collecting information, in a valid and reliable way, about the three target groups of the triangle diagram (in their respective contexts): [[teachers]], [[students]] and [[curricula]].&lt;ref&gt;Fernández, J. (2008).'' Assessment of teaching quality: A circular model of evaluation''. Madrid: Editorial Complutense. {{ISBN|978-84-7491-943-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Evaluation is divided in at least two main types: diagnosis (dysfunctions detection such as physical, sensory and intellectual impairments, dyslexia, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, pervasive development disorders or autism spectrum disorders) and psycho-educational evaluation (detection of curriculum difficulties, poor school atmosphere or family problems, etc.). [[Evaluation]] implies detection, and, thanks to this, [[Prevention Science|Prevention]].

A second function, very relevant too, is psychological counseling.&lt;ref&gt;Erchul, W. P., &amp; Sheridan, S. M. (Eds.).(2008). Handbook of research in school consultation: Empirical foundation for the field. New York: Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-8058-5336-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This must be directed to: a) [[students]], in their various dimensions (intellectual, obviously, but also their social, affective and professional dimensions); b) [[parents]], as ‘paraprofessionals’ who may implement programs, selected or developed by educational psychologists, to solve their child/student problems; c) teachers, to whom will be offered psycho-educational support to face psychological difficulties that may be found when implementing and adapting [[curricula]] to diversity shown by students; d) academic authorities, who will be helped in their decision-making, regarding the teaching (teaching process) and administrative duties (providing necessary support for students with specific educational needs, decisions about promotion to the next level, and so on).

A third function based on [[communitarian interventions]], with three main facets:  corrective, preventative, and optimizing interventions.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, M. K., Codding, R. S., Boice, C. H., &amp; Lukito, G. (2010). Meta-analysis of acquisition and fluency math interventions with instructional and frustration level skills: Evidence for a skill-by-treatment interaction. ''School Psychology Review'', 39, 69-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, L. S., &amp; Fuchs, D. (1986). Linking assessment to instructional intervention: An overview. ''School Psychology Review'', 15,318-323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shonkoff, J., &amp; Meisels, S. J. (Eds.).(2000). Handbook of early childhood intervention (2nd ed.). New York: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-58573-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, R. K., &amp; Reese, H. W. (Eds.).(1980). ''Life-span developmental psychology: Intervention''. New York: Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-0-12-704150-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  If disruptive behavior occurs in particular moments and contexts, then a corrective intervention is required. If the aim is [[school violence]] reduction, then tertiary preventive intervention programs are needed. If an early diagnosis of [[learning disability|learning difficulties]] is carried out, then psychologist has undertaken secondary prevention. If the aim is to use psycho-educational programs to prevent future school failure, then a primary preventative intervention program is put into practice.  The complement to all of these interventions is constituted by a series of optimizing activities, meant for the academic, professional, social, family, and personal improvement of all agents in educational community, especially learners.

A fourth function, or specific activity, is referral of those suffering dysfunctions to other professionals, following a previous diagnostic evaluation, with the aim to coordinate future treatment implementation. This coordination will take place with parents, teachers and other professionals, promoting collaboration among all educational agents in order to get the fastest and best case resolution. This second triangle represents the essential components of school psychology, for some European researchers or division 16 of [[American Psychological Association|APA]].

==Academic requirements==
Nowadays it is a specific Doctoral degree (Masters in Scotland) which generally completes the professional preparation of educational psychologists in the UK.  In this Doctorate in Educational Psychology, it is essential a main course which prepares educational psychologists for carrying out diagnostic and psycho-[[educational assessment]], psychological counseling to the educational communities, and all types of communitarian interventions (corrective, preventive and optimizing).  Trainees also develop external professional practices (where the specific coordination, evaluation, counseling, and intervention functions will be put into practice) on placement in local authorities, as well as a final thesis.  Equally, there are a series of theoretical areas that, due to their relevancy in the teaching/learning contexts, should be included, such as: classroom diversity, drug-dependency prevention, developmental disorders, learning difficulties, new technologies applied to educational contexts and data analysis and interpretation. In sum, taking into account all of this, perhaps educational psychologists will be able to meet adequately demands found in different educational institutions.

The following qualifications are required: an undergraduate degree in psychology (or approved postgraduate conversion course which confers the BPS Graduate Basis for Registration) and a BPS accredited Doctorate in Educational Psychology (3 years), or, for Scotland only, an accredited master's degree in Educational Psychology.  Whilst teaching experience is relevant, it is no longer an entry requirement.  At least one year's full-time experience of working with children in educational, childcare or community settings is required and for some courses this may be two years' experience.

To use the term Educational Psychologist in the UK, one will need to be registered with the Health Care Professionals Council (HCPC), which involves completing a course (Doctorate or Masters) approved by the HCPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospects.ac.uk/educational_psychologist_entry_requirements.htm|title=Educational psychologist job profile - Prospects.ac.uk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===

In the most basic sense of standards for education requirements in the United States an educational psychologist needs a bachelor's degree, followed by a master's degree, and commonly finishing with a PhD or a PsyD in Educational Psychology.&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://careersinpsychology.org/educational-psychologist/|title=How To Become an Educational Psychologist - Education Requirements - Salary Data - CareersinPsychology.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in California, an educational psychologist candidate (commonly referred to as a LEP or Licensed Educational Psychologist) must have a minimum of a master's degree in psychology or a related field in educational psychology. This degree must be couple with a minimum of three years of experience including two years as a credential school psychologist and one year of supervised professional experience in an accredited school psychology program. After completing these requirements a candidate will then taken an LEP examination to determine if the applicant will be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ca.gov/app-reg/lep.shtml|title=Licensed Educational Psychologist (LEP) Requirements - California Board of Behavioral Sciences|first=California Board of Behavioral|last=Sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbs.ca.gov/pdf/forms/lep/lepapp.pdf|title=LICENSED EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGIST APPLICATION PACKET}}&lt;/ref&gt; These requirements are widely accepted by the Board of Behavioral Sciences (BBS) and are considered the common standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.child-neuropsychologist.com/html/body_common_questions_child_psychol.html|title=Common Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040610003301/http://child-neuropsychologist.com/html/body_common_questions_child_psychol.html|archivedate=June 10, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; States may have varying standards but the aforementioned standards are a commonality when working in a school setting. Another route that can be followed is in the research field. It involves many of the same standards without the direct link of being in a school setting.&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"/&gt; Those with a research setting are typically employed through a university and do research based on their own and others findings. They may also teach at the university in their respective field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehe.osu.edu/educational-studies/educational-psychology/|title=Educational Psychology - College of Education and Human Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Job availability/outlook and salary==

The average salary of an educational psychologist is variable dependent on where the psychologist depends on practicing. In a school setting the professional can expect to make around $68,000 a year; however, these professionals are commonly [[school psychologist]]s who have a different background than educational psychologists.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allpsychologycareers.com/salary/educational-psychologist-salaries.html|title=Educational Psychology Salary &amp; Growth Potential|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An educational psychologist in the research and development field could expect to make around $84,000 per year.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt; Both of these averages could be considered inflated with another source listing the average income of an educational psychologist at around $57,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/salary/Educational-Psychologist.html|title=Educational Psychologist Salary - Indeed.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the resounding majority seems to sit at the $67,000 per year range making the previous income average considerably modest.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education-portal.com/articles/Educational_Psychology_Job_Description_Salary_and_Outlook.html|title=Educational Psychology: Job Description, Salary and Outlook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest statistics released in 2010 by the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] place the median annual salary at $72,540 – showing an increase over a four-year period&lt;ref name="careersinpsychology.org"/&gt; – compared to the median household income of the United States which is currently at $51,000. Educational psychologists make approximately 40% more than the average American, making it an advantageous field of study.&lt;ref&gt;[[Household income in the United States#Median inflation-adjusted .28.22real.22.29 household income]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Job outlook in the field of educational psychology is considered in good condition. By national estimates (US) growth in the field ranges from 11–15% between 2006–2022.&lt;ref name="education-portal.com"/&gt; A report released in 2006 the rate of growth was listed as 15% from 2006–2016,&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt; and a separate report released put the growth percentage at a modest 11% from 2012–2022.  Considering most job outlook growth percentages of the time, educational psychologists had the highest in the psychology field and was also considered the highest amongst all occupations at the time of its release in 2006.&lt;ref name="allpsychologycareers.com"/&gt;

'''Emergent literacy''' is a term that is used to explain a child's knowledge of reading and writing skills before they learn how to read and write words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.provolibrary.com/emergent-literacy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405193056/http://www2.provolibrary.com/emergent-literacy|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-04-05|work=Provo City Library at Academy Square|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It signals a belief that, in literate society, young children—even one- and two-year-olds—are in the process of becoming literate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Point Associates - Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li1lk1.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831010615/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li1lk1.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-31|work=Emergent Literacy|publisher=North Central Regional Educational Laboratory|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through the support of parents, caregivers, and educators, a child can successfully progress from emergent to conventional reading.&lt;ref name="ncrel1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Point Associates - Critical Issue: Addressing the Literacy Needs of Emergent and Early Readers|url=http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li100.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817063554/http://www.ncrel.org/sdrs/areas/issues/content/cntareas/reading/li100.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2000-08-17|work=Emergent Literacy|publisher=North Central Regional Educational Laboratory|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic components of emergent literacy include:

* '''Print motivation''': Being interested in and enjoying books.
* '''[[Vocabulary]]''': Knowing the names of things.
* '''Print awareness''': Noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page.
* '''Narrative skills''': Being able to describe things and events and to tell stories.
* '''Letter knowledge''': Understanding letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere.
* '''[[Phonological awareness]]''': Being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

Emergent literacy is of critical importance in early education in light of research showing that children learn skills that prepare them to read years before they start school.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, society has considered reading and writing in their formalistic senses, and viewed children as being knowledgeable about literacy only when they were capable of identifying written words without picture clues, and spelling words that adults could read.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.lcsc.edu/RE303/what_is_emergent_literacy.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026153623/http://www.lcsc.edu/re303/what_is_emergent_literacy.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2004-10-26|work=Academics|publisher=Lews-Clark State College|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, New Zealand researcher [[Marie Clay]] introduced the concept of emergent reading, using it to describe the earliest behaviors and concepts young children employ in interacting with [[book]]s even before they are capable of reading in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clay|first=Marie|title=Reading: The Patterning of Complex Behaviour|year=1967|publisher=Heinemann Educational|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1970s and early 1980s saw robust research activity in children's early language development, early childhood education, and reexamination of the concept of reading readiness. This work resulted in Teale and Sulzby assembling a book authored by various leading researchers of the time that proposed reconceptualizing what happens from birth to the time when children reading and write conventionally as a period of emergent literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Teale|first=William H. |last2=Sulzby|first2=Elizabeth|title=Emergent Literacy: Writing and Reading|year=1986|publisher=Ablex|location=Norwood, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, an extensive body of research has expanded the concept, illuminating that a child's literacy development begins well before formal introduction in school, and can be influenced by social interactions with adults, exposure to literacy materials, and the use of engaged learning activities.&lt;ref name="ncrel1"/&gt;
While the concept of reading readiness suggested that there was a point in time when children were ready to learn to read and write, Clay's notion of emergent literacy suggested that there were continuities in children's literacy development between early literacy behaviors and those displayed once children could read independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is emergent literacy?|url=http://www.ets.uidaho.edu/cdhd/emerlit/intro.htm|publisher=Idaho Center on Developmental Disabilities.|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clay also emphasized the importance of the relationship between writing and reading in early literacy development. Until then, it was believed that children must learn to read before they could learn to write.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clay|first=Marie|title=What Did I Write?|year=1975|publisher=Heinemann Educational|location=Auckland, New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergent literacy skills ==

=== Print motivation ===
This component relates to a child's interest in and enjoyment of books.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt; A child with print motivation might enjoy being read to, playing with books, pretending to write, and going to the library.&lt;ref name="loudoun1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044046/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-04-03 |title=?? |publisher=Library.loudoun.gov |accessdate=2015-04-24 |registration=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children who enjoy books are more likely to want to read, and to keep trying, even when it is hard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Print Motivation|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/28476215/Print-Motivation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521001712/http://www.scribd.com/doc/28476215/Print-Motivation|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-05-21|work=Scribd.com|accessdate=2015-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vocabulary ===
The component "[[vocabulary]]" relates to the knowing of the names of things.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;  Children with rich vocabularies are at a tremendous educational advantage, since studies show that vocabulary is the best predictor of reading comprehension at the end of second and third grades and is otherwise linked to overall academic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shoot for the SSTaRS Strategy|url=http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles-%281%29/Shoot-for-the-SSTaRS-Strategy.aspx|work=The Hanen Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Print awareness ===
This component relates to noticing print, knowing how to handle a book, and knowing how to follow words on a page.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;  It includes knowing that books are organized from left to right, the words are read from left to right and top to bottom, and how to tell words from letters.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergent Literacy: Concepts about Print|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163220/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-11-04|work=George Mason University|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These skills are invaluable to a child's literacy development because without these skills, a child will have difficulty learning how to read and write.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== Narrative skills ===
This component relates to the ability to describe things and events and to tell stories.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;

=== Letter knowledge ===
This component relates to the understanding that letters are different from each other, knowing their names and sounds, and recognizing letters everywhere.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/3.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117004246/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/3.html |date=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phonological awareness ===
This component relates to being able to hear and play with the smaller sounds in words.&lt;ref name="provolibrary1"/&gt;
It involves rhyme recognition, syllables, onset, and rime. Types of [[phonological awareness]] include: phonemic awareness, syllable awareness, word awareness, and sentence awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fouts|first=Lauren|title=Emergent Literacies: Phonological Awareness|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163225/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lessons and activities ==
Emergent literacy lessons may focus on one emergent literacy skill or blend them. Below are examples of emerging literacy games and activities that each focus primarily on one emergent literacy skill.

'''Building vocabulary'''&lt;br /&gt;
Sorting games can help children build vocabulary skills by asking them to identify defining characteristics of the items being sorted. Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by Kansas University, suggests a shoe sorting game in which each child takes off one of his or her shoes. The children work together to sort the shoes by different characteristics, thus building vocabulary related to color, types of fasteners (buckle, velcro), shoe type (sandal, gym shoe), etc. This activity could work with other objects such as legos and pasta. The full activity is available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/shoe |accessdate=April 17, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903012942/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Fshoe |archivedate=September 3, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Hanen Centre outlines another strategy for teaching vocabulary to promote emergent literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weitzman|first=Elaine|title=Shoot for the SSTaRS: A Strategy for Teaching Vocabulary to Promote Emergent Literacy|url=http://www.hanen.org/Helpful-Info/Articles-%281%29/Shoot-for-the-SSTaRS-Strategy.aspx|publisher=The Hanen Centre|accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Letter recognition'''&lt;br /&gt;
Letter recognition games help children learn the letters of the alphabet. In one simple game, the teacher writes each letter of the alphabet on a separate notecard and passes them out to students. The students then have to arrange themselves in alphabetical order. This game is provided by Special Connections, a teaching resource website provided by the University of Kansas, and is available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/abc]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903012957/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Fabc |date=September 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phonological awareness'''&lt;br /&gt;
One type of phonological awareness game involves rhyming, which helps children identify similar sounds in words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra/emergent#Q1]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701033553/http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/cgi-bin/cgiwrap/specconn/main.php?cat=instruction&amp;section=main&amp;subsection=ra%2Femergent |date=July 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one rhyming game, the teacher can present three different "consonant-vowel-consonant" words and ask children which word does not rhyme. For example, cat, log, and dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonologicalawareness.org/4.html |title=Phonological Awareness |publisher=Phonologicalawareness.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full activity and other similar rhyming activities are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phonologicalawareness.org/4.html |title=Phonological Awareness |publisher=Phonological Awareness |date= |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other activities include: songs and chants; word play, games, rhymes and riddles; Storybooks, poetry, nursery rhymes, Dr. Seuss;
Oral Storytelling; Clapping, jumping, manipulating letters, blocks.
Everything should be playful, engaging, interactive, social, deliberate, and purposeful, stimulate curiosity, and encourage experimentation with language and comprehensive language and literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fouts|first=Lauren|title=Emergent Literacy Phonological Awareness|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163225/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/2.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print motivation'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since print motivation involves a child's interest and enjoyment of books, there are a variety of activities that parents and teachers can share with children to help promote print motivation. Examples include:
* Read often and make it enjoyable
* Read when you{{Who|date=May 2012}} and the child are in a good mood, so the experience is a positive one
* Change your voice when you read aloud
* Keep books accessible to children
* Stop reading when a child becomes tired or loses interest

Print motivation tips adapted from the Loudon County Public Library.&lt;ref name="loudoun1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403044046/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=67|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-04-03|title=??|publisher=Library.loudoun.gov|accessdate=2015-04-24|registration=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Print awareness'''&lt;br /&gt;
Print awareness is a child's understanding of the parts of a book and how a book works. The State Library of Louisiana suggests an activity in which a child shares the parts of a book with an adult. For example, the teacher or parent could ask the child to point out different parts of the book and its contents, such as the front cover; the title; the first line of the book; a word; a letter; and the back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.lib.la.us/empowerlibrary/Print%20Awareness%20Activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Print Awareness Activities |publisher=State.lib.la.us |accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George Mason University suggests additional family activities. These include: Make a book with your children. You might include familiar photographs with labels under each photo, or children might illustrate the book by themselves. Parents could write the words as the children dictate the story. Or, when going out to a restaurant, show the menu to your children and point to the words as you read to them.  Let them choose what they want to eat and make it an interactive experience. This will help children understand how print is connected to real life. Additional activities can be found online.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Iantosca|first=Elena|title=Emergent Literacy Concepts About Print|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104163220/http://mason.gmu.edu/~cwallac7/TAP/TEST/literacy/1.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=4 November 2007|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=18 April 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narrative skills'''&lt;br /&gt;
Children can build narrative skills by describing something that happened to him or her, even something as simple as taking a bath. Parents and teachers can promote narrative skills by prompting children for further detail. Other activities to promote narrative skills in both babies and toddlers are available from the Loudon County Library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=69|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709163509/http://library.loudoun.gov/Default.aspx?tabid=69|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-09|title=?? |publisher=Library.loudoun.gov |accessdate=2015-04-24 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''{{Lang|de|Gebrauchsmusik}}''''' ({{IPA-de|ɡəˈbʁaʊ̯ksmuˌziːk}}) is a German term, meaning "utility [[music]]", for music that exists not only for its own sake, but which was [[musical composition|composed]] for some specific, identifiable purpose. This purpose can be a particular historical event, like a political rally or a military ceremony, or it can be more general, as with music written to accompany dance, or music written for amateurs or students to perform.

While composer [[Paul Hindemith]] is probably the figure most identified with this expression, it seems to have been coined within the realm of [[musicology]] rather than composition. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the modern academic discipline of musicology was formulated by a mainly German group of scholars who were interested not only in formal development and biographical data, but also to an extent in the sociopolitical position of music throughout history, and the relationship of music and musicians to society at large.

==Paul Nettl's view of dance music==
Perhaps the first such musicologist to use the word ''Gebrauchsmusik'' was {{ill|Paul Nettl|de}}, writing in 1921 ("Beiträge zur Geschichte der Tanzmusik im 17. Jahrhundert", ''Zeitschrift für Musikwissenschaft'', iv [1921–2], 257–65), who employed it in reference to half of his perceived binarism between that 17th-century dance music which was in fact danced to, and that which was written in dance forms but was actually abstract music intended only for listening (by extension, this duality applied to the dichotomy between any music for a specific purpose, ''Gebrauchsmusik'', and that for none but the pleasure or edification of listening, ''Vortragsmusik'').

Nettl arrived at this dual-development view of dance music through his observation that such pieces began, as the century progressed, to use stylistic and formal devices that were farther from the province of simple utility and more aligned with some anticipation of a listening audience paying full attention. The period's emerging binary dance form featured such characteristics as an increasing tonicization of foreign keys, an increasingly explicit and emphasized dominant-tonic tonal axis, and a refined delicacy of ornamentation, all of which would seem superfluous in application to a music intended only as the rhythmic accompaniment to physical activity. In addition to these developments in the individual movements, they were organized into ever more extended and stylized [[suite (music)|suite]]s, which greatly resembled other instrumental forms of the day. Indeed, the mature [[sonata da camera]] is virtually indistinguishable from the dance suite of the time.

Nettl saw in this situation a clear distinction between music that was intended mainly to be in the service of dancers, and that which was mainly intended to service the ideals of art. In articulating this distinction, however, Nettl did not imply that utility music was unimportant artistically. Instead, he pointed out the importance of social need or desire as a catalyst for artistic development.

==Heinrich Besseler's thesis==
Two years later, also discussing the 17th-century suite (in ''Beiträge zur Stilgeschichte der deutschen Suite im 17. Jahrhundert'', his dissertation of 1923), [[Heinrich Besseler]] went a step further, to imply that such utility music was socially superior, if not artistically so. For Besseler, "aesthetic access" (''{{Lang|de|Zugangsweise}}'') to the dance music was gained through participation, be it playing, dancing, or even singing along, rather than mere listening. He further expounded this thesis in a 1925 article on motets of the [[Medieval music|Medieval period]], in which he proposed that such works had not been designed for the enjoyment of listeners, but with only their devotional purpose in mind; this purpose would only be fulfilled through participation, whether performance or prayer. In making this point, Besseler sought to divide all music into two distinct categories, continuing to use the word ''Gebrauchsmusik'' for one, and likening this to vernacular language, while replacing Nettl's word for the other with ''eigenständige Musik''&amp;mdash;alone-standing, or autonomous music. Besseler had studied philosophy with [[Martin Heidegger]], and thought that this musical duality reflected Heidegger's between "thing" and "equipment", for the autonomous and the specific-purposed, respectively.

==The politics of Gebrauchsmusik and its later discrediting==
It was Besseler's notion of this concept which took hold in German musical culture of the 1920s and 1930s, becoming something of a controversy within that sphere, and even spilling into political ideology. Such a distinction had always existed in music, and that some works had always been composed for specific occasions and others not (at least since the [[Renaissance]], in all probability), is attested to by the work of Besseler and Nettl, who based their concepts on studies of the historical situation. Even so, the musicologically conceived term ''Gebrauchsmusik'' somehow came to be construed as a concept of modern political administration. Some composers and government officials identified a need for community music, to be played by amateurs and young people at large festivals; the long German tradition of community singing benefited greatly from this impulse. Hindemith, [[Kurt Weill]], and many others contributed works with such intentions in mind as the fledgling [[Weimar Republic]] tried to stave off collapse. The cultural, rather than solely political, nature of this movement will be seen, however, from the observation that Hindemith was for the most part a political agnostic, while Weill was an avowed leftist. Composers, regardless of their political views, were largely in favor of the ''Gebrauchsmusik'' concept at its outset because a recognized need and desire for occasion-tailored works would lead to a constant call for them. All combatants in the political arena saw in community music-making a potential glue with which to unite the German people behind their respective agendas; rather than expend the often wasted effort of regaling them with rhetoric, left and right alike could simply awe the public with spectacle and envelop them in the ecstasy of art. The right wing took ''Gebrauchsmusik'' as a tool when the former began its ascendancy, which is probably the main reason for the latter's increased discredit and abandonment as the decade progressed, and the most important German artists and thinkers departed for more hospitable locales.

A second reason, though, for this discredit was the occurrence to certain composers and their followers that composing music for large-scale public use would lead to a need for them to pander as well to large-scale public taste. Such a concept was anathematic to the [[Art for art's sake|art-for-art's-sake]] ideal which followed alongside that of community music in Germany since the days of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who had ushered in the era of the well-regarded and financially successful free-lance composer. [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]] wrote to the effect that ''Gebrauchsmusik'' would hardly out-live its present-day application, while that composed for art and no other purpose would have the only chance at immortality. Schoenberg also noted that there had been less and less call for such utility music since the end of the Republic anyway, and certainly since the conclusion of the war. As a result of this, ''Gebrauchsmusik'''s most ardent promoters had again become "ideal artists". (Schoenberg, ''Style and Idea'', 1950). Earlier (articles of 1924 and 1932), the critic [[Theodor Adorno]] had called the work of Hindemith and other ''Gebrauchsmusiker'' symptomatic of "false [social] consciousness", and condemned it as being not truly useful at all, due to what he considered its lack of emotional content. By the late 1950s, ''Gebrauchsmusik'' had become almost universally a term of insult, especially among composers. No less than Hindemith attempted, somewhat, to back away from it, when in a lecture at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1950, he said that "quite obviously music for which no use can be found, that is to say, useless music, is not entitled to public consideration anyway and consequently the ''Gebrauch'' is taken for granted", and also that "[u]p to this day it has been impossible to kill the silly term and the unscrupulous classification that goes with it." (quoting himself in ''A Composer's World'', 1952)

==Reassessment==
Adorno had included [[Stravinsky]] among the targets of his anti-''Gebrauchsmusik'' diatribes, and though the terminology and classification-system under present consideration is clearly and primarily German, the impulse of composers to write and officials to commission music for specific or ceremonial use is quite obviously universal. Stravinsky is perhaps not the best example of a non-German composer in such a vein who was active in the 1920s and 1930s, but he did make his name largely with a series of ballets. Along with these, it will be well-remembered that immortal and beloved works of [[Carl Orff|Orff]], [[Zoltán Kodály|Kodály]], [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]], [[Aaron Copland|Copland]], and many others were written under the impulse of ''Gebrauchsmusik''. As the dawn of the 21st century pushes the blinding political travails of times past into the fog of history{{Fact|date=May 2013}}, modern commentators have begun to consider that, while ''Gebrauchsmusik'' may compromise the composer in some respects, many of the greatest works of not only the 20th century but the 19th and earlier (witness the French tradition of vast, ceremonial works from that period) were composed with public and popular usage in mind. As Kurt Weill wrote in 1929, the use for which a composition was intended and its artistic value are matters for separate consideration. Indeed, they always have been, and continue to be now; to this attests the continued success of the above-considered composers and their works long after their original "utility" has subsided.

==Personal life==
Zinkhan had two children, a son and a daughter, with his wife, attorney Marie Bruce.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Zinkhan also had three children from a previous marriage.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} The family lived in the town of [[Bogart, Georgia|Bogart]] in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.redandblack.com/media/storage/paper871/news/2009/04/27/News/Zinkhan.odd.Prolific.Professor-3726732.shtml "Zinkhan 'odd,' prolific professor"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430101023/http://media.www.redandblack.com/media/storage/paper871/news/2009/04/27/News/Zinkhan.odd.Prolific.Professor-3726732.shtml |date=2009-04-30 }}, by Daniel Burdett, ''[[The Red and Black]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Zinkhan owned a second home in [[Amsterdam]], the capital of the [[Netherlands]], where he was a marketing professor at the [[Vrije Universiteit]].&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;

==Murder charges==
Zinkhan was named the prime suspect in the April 25, 2009, shooting deaths of his wife and two other people, Tom Tanner and Ben Teague, outside the Athens Community Theatre in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens-Clarke County]] in northeast Georgia.&lt;ref name="Three dead"/&gt; The murders occurred during a picnic reunion of the Town &amp; Gown Players, and all three of those killed were active in local theater productions.

&lt;/ref&gt; Police said Zinkhan and his wife, Marie Bruce, were having “marital difficulties,” that Tom Tanner appeared to be his “specific target” in the shootings and that Ben Teague was “at the wrong place at the wrong time.” Tanner was shot first, police said.&lt;ref name="pallet"&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/services/content/metro/stories/2009/05/12/zinkhan_grave.html Athens killer lay in grave under pallet, shot himself], [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]], May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, "Zinkhan was charged with three counts of murder and a state [[arrest warrant]] was issued in Clarke County, Georgia. A federal arrest warrant was issued on April 26, 2009, after he was charged with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution."&lt;ref name="FBI"/&gt;

==Death==

Investigators said that Zinkhan used a shovel to dig a {{convert|15|to|18|in|mm|adj=mid|-deep}} grave in the woods behind [[Clarke County School District|Cleveland Road Elementary]], lay down in it, took an old wooden pallet he had covered with dirt and debris and pulled it over top of the hole.&lt;ref name="The Augusta Chronicle"&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/latest/lat_519041.shtml "Police say Zinkhan targeted Tanner, committed suicide"], by Allison Floyd; [[The Augusta Chronicle]]", May 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He then fired a single shot from a .38-caliber handgun into his head.&lt;ref name="pallet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ajc" /&gt;

Zinkhan's body was claimed by a son from a previous marriage one day before it was scheduled for burial in a pauper's grave by the Athens-Clarke County coroner's office.&lt;ref name="burial"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/CRIME/05/15/zinkhan.body/index.html Son claims body of professor accused in killings], [[CNN]], May 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25081">The '''Going broke universities – Disappearing universities''' (危ない大学・消える大学 ''Abunai Daigaku Kieru Daigaku'') is a ranking book about Japanese Universities by Japanese journalist [[:ja:島野清志|Kiyoshi Shimano]], published annually since 1993.

Although there are several university rankings in Japan, most of them rank universities by their entrance difficulties often called "[[Standard score|Hensachi]]" or by alumni's successes. Especially, the Hensachi Rankings have been most commonly used for university ranking.&lt;ref&gt;増田 晶文 "大学は学生に何ができるか" 2003&lt;/ref&gt; From this view point, GBUDU is a typical ranking book in Japan.

The GBUDU ranks Japanese Universities in terms of the entrance difficulty and selectivity. The author's main argument is that more selective universities have better quality, and generally guarantee students better future careers. Thus people should avoid least selective universities, and try to enter more selective ones as much as they can.&lt;ref name="GBUDU1"&gt;{{cite web |title=危ない大学・消える大学 2012年版 |year=2011 |publisher=YELL books |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4753930181|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However, it is not always true that more selective universities are better for job hunting (e.g. universities in big cities such as Greater Tokyo and Greater Osaka are more competitive in Japanese job market). In fact, Shimano also regularly publishes another ranking book from this perspective (see the reference below).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=就職でトクする大学・損する大学ランキング 2012年版 |year=2011 |publisher=YELL books |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4753929760|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The GBUDU rankings are made by the average scores of Hensachi estimated by Japanese major prep school [[:ja:代々木ゼミナール|Yoyogi seminar]].&lt;ref name="GBUDU1"/&gt; Consequently, it can be regarded as a summary of the selectivity of Japanese universities.&lt;ref&gt;Usually prep schools provide rankings in each subject, but rarely do the whole university rankings. From this point of view, GBUDU is one of few publications which provide this data.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;However this ranking system doesn't include several small specialist universities. For example, all of the independent medical schools are not considered, although their entrance difficulties are highly competitive. Therefore, this ranking system only includes major universities.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Normally, National/Public Universities and Private Universities use different sort of exams, so it's not easily comparable. Hensachi scores have a tendency to be higher with Private Universities. Shimano applies his own measurement to fix this tendency to make it more realistic.&lt;/ref&gt;

He prepared the following 10 scales to measure universities' entrance difficulties.
[[File:Selectivity of J uni.PNG|thumb|400px|Selectivity of SA, A1, A2, and B groups.&lt;ref&gt;This data is computed from the cumulative number of students in each group per Japanese population at 18(1,220,000 [http://gakusan.gakken.jp/home/column/univ.exam/article/090401.html]), and all Japanese university students at 18(60% of the population, i.e. 732,000 [http://gakusan.gakken.jp/home/column/univ.exam/article/090401.html]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The number of undergraduate students in the same year in SA is 47,353, in A1 is 82,970, in A2 is 91,938, and in B is 37,781.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This counted number includes international students, so rigorously, the national selectivity would be smaller than these numbers. For example, The selectivity of SA without international students is 3.8% and 6.4% (originally 3.9% and 6.5%).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hensachi is a statistic indicator which represents a position of a sample group. The 50 of Hensachi means average, above 50 means higher than average, and below 50 means lower than average.&lt;br&gt; It is estimated by using the following equation.&lt;br&gt;      Hensachi = [z-score] x 10 + 50.&lt;br&gt;
The Hensachi in this diagram is calculated from the selectivity percentage (i.e. one-tailed P-value).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;some vocational schools are reasonably selective. Thus it doesn't mean all university students are academically more talented than non-university students. Plus, the academic ability also depends on the subject and field of study. Therefore, we have to see the diagram as a rough indication.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

However this ranking book doesn't contain 2 year colleges.&lt;/ref&gt; 778

After a brief career in film writing and film directing, in 1979 Salter published the novel ''Solo Faces''.

==Biography==
{{more citations needed | section, except for one footnote, | date= August 2013}}
On June 10, 1925 Salter was born and named '''James Arnold Horowitz''', the son of Mildred Scheff and George Horowitz.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;  His father was a real estate broker and businessman, who had graduated from [[West Point]] in November 1918 as [[World War I]] was ending and served briefly in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]].

James Horowitz grew up in Manhattan, where he attended P.S.6, and the [[Horace Mann School]] – his classmates included [[Julian Beck]], while [[Jack Kerouac]] was in a more junior class.

While Horowitz intended to study at [[Stanford University]] or [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], he entered West Point on July 15, 1942, at the urging of his father – who had rejoined the Corps of Engineers in July 1941, in anticipation of war breaking out. (With others from his original Class of 1919, George Horowitz was called back to West Point after a month of duty to complete a post-graduate officer's course.) Like his father, Horowitz's time at West Point was shortened due to wartime class sizes were greatly increased and the curriculum drastically shortened. He graduated in 1945 after just three years, ranked 49th in general merit in his class of 852. 

He completed flight training during his first class year, with primary flight training at [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], and advanced training at [[Stewart Air Force Base|Stewart Field]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. On a cross-country navigation flight in May 1945, his flight became scattered and, low on fuel, he mistook a railroad [[trestle]] for a runway, crash-landing his [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texan]] training craft into a house in [[Great Barrington, Massachusetts]]. Possibly as a result, he was assigned to multi-engine training in [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25s]] until February 1946. He received his first unit assignment with the [[6th Airlift Squadron|6th Troop Carrier Squadron]], stationed at [[Nielson Field]], the Philippines; [[Naha Air Base]], [[Okinawa]]; and [[Tachikawa Air Base]], Japan. He was promoted to 1st lieutenant in January 1947.

Horowitz was transferred in September 1947 to [[Hickam AFB]], [[Hawaii]], then entered post-graduate studies at [[Georgetown University]] in August 1948, receiving his [[master's degree]] in January 1950. He was assigned to the headquarters of [[Tactical Air Command]] at [[Langley AFB]], [[Virginia]], in March 1950, where he remained until volunteering for assignment in the [[Korean War]]. He arrived in Korea in February 1952 after transition training in the [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] with the [[75th Fighter Squadron|75th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] at [[Presque Isle International Airport|Presque Isle Air Force Base]], [[Maine]]. He was assigned to the 335th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, [[4th Fighter Wing|4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing]], a renowned [[MiG]]-hunting unit. He flew more than 100 combat missions between February 12 and August 6, 1952 and was credited with a [[MiG-15]] victory on July 4, 1952. 

Horowitz used his Korean experience for his first novel, ''[[The Hunters (novel)|The Hunters]]'' (1956), which was [[The Hunters (1958)|made into a film]] in 1958 starring [[Robert Mitchum]].

The film adaptation of ''The Hunters'' was honored with acclaim for its powerful performances, moving plot, and realistic portrayal of the Korean War. Although an excellent adaptation by [[Hollywood]] standards, it was very different from the original novel, which dealt with the slow self-destruction of a 31-year-old fighter pilot, who had once been thought a "hot shot" but who found only frustration in his first combat experience while others around him achieved glory, some of it perhaps invented.

Horowitz subsequently was stationed in Germany and France, promoted to major, and assigned to lead an aerial demonstration team; he became a squadron operations officer, in line to become a squadron commander. In his off-duty time he worked on his fiction, completing a manuscript that eventually was rejected by publishers, and another that became ''The Hunters''. Despite the responsibilities of a spouse and two small children, he abruptly left active duty with the Air Force in 1957 to pursue his writing, a decision he found difficult because of his passion for flying. In total, he had served twelve years in the [[US Air Force]], the last six as a fighter pilot.

His works based on his Air Force experiences have a fatalistic tone: his protagonists, after struggling with conflicts between their reputations and self-perceptions, tend to be killed in the performance of their duties while inept antagonists within their own ranks soldier on.

His 1961 novel ''The Arm of Flesh'' drew on his experiences flying with the 36th Fighter-Day Wing at [[Bitburg Air Base]], Germany, between 1954 and 1957. An extensively-revised version of the novel was reissued in 2000 as ''Cassada''. Salter however, later disdained both of his "Air Force" novels as products of youth "not meriting much attention." After several years in the [[Air Force Reserve]], he severed his military connection completely in 1961 by resigning his commission after his unit was called up to active duty for the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961|Berlin Crisis]].

He moved back to New York with his family and legally changed his name to Salter.

Salter and his first wife Ann divorced in 1975, having had four children: Allan (born 1955, died 1980), Nina (born 1957), Claude and James (twins, born 1962). Starting in 1976 he lived with journalist and playwright Kay Eldredge. They had a son, Theo Salter, born in 1985, and they married in Paris in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Vernon, Alex| chapter=| title=Soldiers Once And Still: Ernest Hemingway, James Salter, and Tim O'Brien| editor=| publisher=University of Iowa Press| isbn= 0-87745-886-3| year=2004| pages=}}, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge and Salter co-authored a book entitled ''[https://www.amazon.com/Life-Is-Meals-Food-Lovers/dp/0375711392 Life Is Meals: A Food Lover's Book of Days]'', in 2006.

==Writing career==
Salter took up film writing, first as a writer of independent documentary films, winning a prize at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in collaboration with television writer [[Lane Slate]] (''Team, Team, Team''). He also wrote for Hollywood, although disdainful of it. His last script, commissioned and then rejected by [[Robert Redford]], became his novel, ''Solo Faces''.

Widely regarded as one of the most artistic writers of modern American fiction, Salter was critical of his own work, having said that only his 1967 novel ''[[A Sport and a Pastime]]'' comes close to living up to his standards. Set in post-war France, ''A Sport and a Pastime'' is a piece of [[erotica]] involving an American student and a young Frenchwoman, told as flashbacks in the present tense by an unnamed narrator who barely knows the student, also yearns for the woman, and freely admits that most of his narration is fantasy. Many characters in Salter's short stories and novels reflect his passion for European culture and, in particular, for France, which he describes as a "secular holy land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Margaret Winchell|title=Glimpses of a Secular Holy Land: The Novels of James Salter|journal=The Hollins Critic|date=February 1982|volume=IXX|issue=1|pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salter's prose shows the apparent influence of both [[Ernest Hemingway]] and [[Henry Miller]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, but in interviews with his biographer, William Dowie, Salter states that he was most influenced by [[André Gide]] and [[Thomas Wolfe]]. His writing often is described by reviewers as "succinct" or "compressed"{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, with short sentences and sentence fragments, and switching between first and third persons, as well as between the present and past tenses. His dialogue is attributed only when necessary to keep clear who is speaking, otherwise he allows the reader to draw inferences from tone and motivation.

His 1997 memoir ''Burning the Days'' uses this prose style to chronicle the impact his experiences at West Point, in the Air Force, and as a celebrity pseudo-expatriate in Europe had on the way he viewed his life-style changes. Although it appears to celebrate numerous episodes of [[adultery]], in fact, Salter is reflecting on what has transpired and the impressions of him it has left, just as does his poignant reminiscence on the death of his daughter.&lt;!--“I have never been able to write the story. I reach a certain point and cannot go on. The death of kings can be recited, but not of one’s child.”--&gt; A line from ''The Hunters'' expresses these feelings: "They knew nothing of the past and its holiness."

Salter published a collection of short stories, ''Dusk and Other Stories'' in 1988. The collection received the [[PEN/Faulkner Award]], and one of its stories ("Twenty Minutes") became the basis for the 1996 film [[Boys (1996 film)|''Boys'']]. He was elected to [[The American Academy of Arts and Letters]] in 2000. In 2012, [[PEN/Faulkner Foundation]] selected him for the 25th [[PEN/Malamud Award]] saying that his works show the readers "how to work with fire, flame, the laser, all the forces of life at the service of creating sentences that spark and make stories burn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Salter to Receive 2012 PEN/Malamud Award|url=http://www.penfaulkner.org/2012/05/21/james-salter-to-receive-2012-penmalamud-award/|publisher=[[PEN/Faulkner Foundation]]|accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Salter to Receive the 2012 PEN/Malamud Award for Excellence in the Short Story (press release)|url=http://www.penfaulkner.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/SalterPR.pdf|publisher=[[PEN/Faulkner Foundation]]|date=21 May 2012 |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His final novel, ''All That Is,'' was published to excellent reviews in 2013.

Salter's writings—including correspondence, manuscripts, and heavily revised typescript drafts for all of his published works including short stories and screenplays—are archived at the [[Harry Ransom Center]] in Austin, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ransom Center Acquires James Salter Archive|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2000/salterpr.html|accessdate=13 November 2012|date=28 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 2014 Salter became the first Kapnick Writer-in-Residence at the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.virginia.edu/content/master-stylist-james-salter-takes-post-first-kapnick-writer-residence Virginia.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

He died on June 19, 2015 in [[Sag Harbor, New York]].&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

A descendant of one of the first settlers to America, [[Philippe de la Noye|Philippe de la Noye (Delano)]] (1602–1681) Jane Delano attended Cook Academy, a [[Baptist]] boarding school in her hometown then studied nursing at the [[Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing]] in [[New York City]], where she graduated in 1886.

==Professional life==
She started work in 1888 at a [[Jacksonville, Florida]] hospital treating victims of a [[yellow fever]] epidemic. There, she demonstrated her superior executive and administrative skills and developed innovative nursing procedures for the patients under her care. Leaving Florida, Jane Delano then spent three years nursing [[typhoid]] patients at a copper mine in [[Bisbee, Arizona]] until accepting an  appointment as the Superintendent of Nurses at University Hospital in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

In 1898, during the [[Spanish–American War]], Jane Delano became a member of the New York Chapter of the [[American Red Cross]] and served as the secretary for the enrollment of nurses. In 1902 she returned to Bellevue Hospital in New York City as the director of the Training School for Nurses where she remained until 1909 when she was made Superintendent of the [[United States Army Nurse Corps]]. During this time, her invaluable contributions to her profession resulted in her being named president of the [[American Nurses Association]] and chair of the National Committee of the Red Cross Nursing Service.

A leading pioneer of the modern nursing profession, Delano almost single-handedly created American Red Cross Nursing when she united the work of the American Nurses Association, the Army Nurse Corps, and the American Red Cross. Through her efforts, emergency response teams were organized for disaster relief and over 8,000 [[registered nurses]] were trained and ready for duty by the time the United States entered [[World War I]]. During the course of the War, more than 20,000 of her nurses played vital roles with the United States military.  For her contributions during the war she was awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] by the Secretary of the Army.

==Death==

Jane Delano died in [[France]] while on a Red Cross mission, expiring at Base Hospital No. 8 in [[Savenay]] of Loire-Inferieure, and was interred in a cemetery in the [[Loire Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;Base Hospital No. 8 was fourteen miles from the Port of St. Nazaire.&lt;/ref&gt; The mission was to participate in and represent the American Red Cross at the preliminary conference of Red Cross workers and health experts of the world being held at Cannes. Awarded the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] posthumously, the year following her death her remains were brought back to the United States by the Army Quartermaster Corps and re-interred in the nurses section at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. At the top of the hill overlooking the nurses section is a bronze memorial to Jane Delano and the 296 nurses who lost their lives during World War I. Military funeral services, prior to burial, were held Saturday, September 18, 1920. A number of representatives of the American Red Cross, Army officers of the Army Medical Corps, and a delegation of uniformed nurses attended the funeral. A detachment of Army troops and a military band from Fort Myers acted as an escort for the body when it was taken to the grave from the vault at Arlington Cemetery. All present stood silent as "taps" was given over the grave of Miss Delano.&lt;ref&gt;''Military Funeral For Red Cross Nurse Head''. Associated Press. Washington. Sept. 18, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

Delano has been honored many times for her dedication to humanity. She was named to the [[American Nurses Association Hall of Fame]] and at [[Schuyler County Hospital]] in [[Dix, New York]] there is a Jane Delano Memorial with a display of personal items including a number of her awards and medals. In 1990, the [[National Nursing Advisory Committee]] formed the "[[Jane Delano Society]]" to ensure active nursing involvement at all levels of the Red Cross and to preserve artifacts that document the history of Red Cross nursing.

==Works==
Bordas published her first book, ''Salsa, Soul, and Spirit: Leadership for a Multicultural Age'', in 2007. The book presents eight principles of multicultural leadership gleaned from Latino, African American, and Native American cultures.&lt;ref name=tips&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pubs.lib.umn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&amp;context=ijps|title=Intergalactic Leadership: Practical Tips for Leading Where No One Has Gone Before|journal=Interdisciplinary Journal of Partnership Studies|volume=2|issue=1|date=July 2015|first=Peg A.|last=Lonnquist|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also profiles leaders from those backgrounds.&lt;ref name=edge/&gt;&lt;ref name=leading/&gt; In the book, Bordas mentions a common impediment for educational advancement in the Latino community called the "crab syndrome":

&lt;blockquote&gt;My parents wanted to protect me; they struggled with my decision to leave home to attend college. They were also afraid that once I left, I wouldn't come back.

'''Juliette Derricotte''' (April 1, 1897 – November 7, 1931) was an [[African-American]] educator and political activist whose death after receiving racist treatment after a fatal car accident in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], sparked outrage in the African-American community. At the time of her death she was Dean of Women at [[Fisk University]].

==Early life==

She was born in [[Athens, Georgia]], the fifth of nine children of Isaac Derricotte and Laura Derricotte, a [[shoemaking|cobbler]] and a [[seamstress]]. As a child, she was hopeful of attending the local Institute and was crushed when her mother told her she would be unable due to her color. This event helped shape Juliette's perception of the world and her desire to change people's racial prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rummel|first=Jack|title=African-American Social Leaders and Activists|year=2003|publisher=Facts On File|isbn=0-8160-4840-1|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==

Her drive for education helped land her in [[Talladega College]], where she ended up getting a scholarship for her public speaking. After she graduated in 1918, she enrolled at the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) Training School. She then became the YWCA secretary of the National Student Council. Her responsibilities included visiting colleges, planning conferences, and fostering ideas and leadership. She is credited with recreating the council in ideology, helping it become more balanced, open, and most importantly, interracial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anthony, III|first=David Henry|title=Max Yergan: Race Man, Internationalist, Cold Warrior|year=2006|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0814707043|pages=128–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Derricotte became a member of the [[World Student Christian Federation]] and began traveling the world as a delegate representing [[United States|American]] colleges. In 1927, she received a master's degree in religious education from [[Columbia University]]. She resigned her YWCA position in 1929 to become Dean of Women at [[Fisk University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=William M|title=The Will of Man|year=2007|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-4257-9683-9|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Kientz Anderson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lY3foPCsUJ8C&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=lauren%20kientz%20anderson&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=lauren%20kientz%20anderson&amp;f=false "A Nauseating Sentiment, a Magical Device, or a Real Insight? Interracialism at Fisk University in 1930"], in Marybeth Gasman and Roger L. Geiger (eds), ''Higher Education for African Americans Before the Civil Rights Era, 1900-1964'', Perspectives on the History of Higher Education, Vol. 29, New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction Publishers, 2012, pp. 75–111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Derricotte was an active member of [[Delta Sigma Theta]], and was affiliated with the sorority's first graduate chapter in New York City. After her death Delta established a scholarship fund in her honor, it would be awarded to members of the sorority who are employed in the social work field. 

==Deadly discrimination==
Derricotte died in a traffic accident in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], in 1931. While she was riding in a car driven by a student, they collided with a white couple. Both Derricotte and the student were seriously injured. Although they received emergency treatment from white doctors, they were refused admittance to the local hospital because they were black. They were moved to a local woman's house, and both died by morning. This triggered national outrage and several investigations, one involving the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=David Levering|authorlink=David Levering Lewis|title=[[W.

==Legacy==
In the 1930s, [[Sue Bailey Thurman]] who had been inspired by Derricotte's ideas about learning and travel, established a scholarship fund, the Juliette Derricotte Scholarship, which allowed African-American undergraduate women of high academic achievement to study and travel abroad. One of the recipients of her scholarship was [[Margaret Bush Wilson]], who revived the fund decades later.&lt;ref name="Juliette Derricotte"&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiMauro|first1=Susan|title=The Juliette Derricotte Scholarship: From the Desk of Margaret Bush Wilson|url=http://wulibraries.typepad.com/bears_repeating/2013/03/the-juliette-derricotte-scholarship-from-the-desk-of-margaret-bush-wilson.html|website=Washington University Libraries|publisher=Washington University|accessdate= August 4, 2015|location=St. Louis, Missouri|date=March 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices in [[language education]] vary significantly by region. Firstly, the languages being learned differ; in the [[United States]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the most popular language to be learned, whereas the most popular languages to be learned in [[Australia]] are [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]. Also, [[Methods of teaching foreign languages|teaching methods]] tend to differ by region. [[Language immersion]] is popular in some European countries, but is not used very much in the [[United States]].

==Europe==

===Foreign language education===
1995 [[European Commission]]’s White Paper "Teaching and learning – Towards the learning society", stated that "upon completing initial training, everyone should be proficient in two Community foreign languages". The Lisbon Summit of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.

In fact, even in 1974, at least one foreign language was compulsory in all but two European member states: [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (apart from [[Scotland]]). By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} exception being the Republic of Ireland, where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]], but neither is considered a foreign language although a third European language is also taught. Pupils in upper secondary education learn at least ''two'' foreign languages in [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[Iceland]], [[Switzerland]], [[Greece]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Poland]], [[Romania]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Slovakia]].

On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, pupils have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In Luxembourg, [[Norway]], [[Italy]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language starts at age six, in [[Sweden]] at age seven and in Belgium at age 10. About half of the EU's primary school pupils learn a foreign language.

English is the language taught most often at lower secondary level in the EU. There, 93% of children learn English. At upper secondary level, English is even more widely taught. [[French language|French]] is taught at lower secondary level in all EU countries except [[Slovenia]]. A total of 33% of European Union pupils learn French at this level. At upper secondary level the figure drops slightly to 28%. [[German language|German]] is taught in nearly all EU countries. A total of 13% of pupils in the European Union learn German in lower secondary education, and 20% learn it at an upper secondary level.

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey{{which|date=November 2010}} showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language. Less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language, for example. 80% said they could work abroad anyway, because "everyone speaks English." In 2001, a European Commission survey{{which|date=November 2010}} found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardize the learning of languages across Europe (one of the first results being [[UNIcert]]).

===Bilingual education===
{{Main|Bilingual education}}

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a [[minority language|minority]] or [[regional language]] community use partial immersion to teach both the minority and the state language.

In the 1960s and 1970s, some central and eastern European countries created a system of bilingual schools for well-performing pupils. Subjects other than languages were taught in a foreign language. In the 1990s this system was opened to all pupils in general education, although some countries still make candidates sit an entrance exam. At the same time, Belgium's French community, [[France]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]] and [[Finland]] also started bilingual schooling schemes. [[Germany]] meanwhile had established some bilingual schools in the late 1960s.

==United States==
{{main|Language education in the United States}}
In most school systems, foreign language is taken in [[high school]], with many schools requiring one to three years of foreign language in order to graduate. In some school systems, foreign language is also taught during middle school, and recently, many elementary schools have begun teaching foreign languages as well. However, foreign language immersion programs are growing in popularity, making it possible for elementary school children to begin serious development of a second language.

In 2008 the Center for Applied Linguistics conducted an extensive survey documenting foreign language study in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cal.org/content/download/2241/29054/version/2/file/ForeignLanguageExecutiveSummary.pdf|title=Foreign Language Teaching in U.S. Schools: Results of a National Survey|last1=Rhodes|first1=Nancy C.|last2=Pufahl|first2=Ingrid|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|date=November 2009|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most popular language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]], due to the large number of recent Spanish-speaking immigrants to the United States (see [[Spanish in the United States]]). According to this survey, in 2008 88% of language programs in elementary schools taught Spanish, compared to 93% in secondary schools. Other languages taught in U.S. high schools in 2008, in descending order of frequency, were [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin Chinese]], [[American Sign Language]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. During the [[Cold War]], the United States government pushed for [[Russian language|Russian]] education, and some schools still maintain their Russian programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0405/p11s02-legn.html|title=You learned Russian - in high school?|last=Méndez|first=Theresa|date=5 April 2005|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other languages recently gaining popularity include [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The Center for Applied Linguistics also conducted a study that concluded that while the number of schools from the elementary to secondary level offering foreign language instruction are on the rise, a pitfall of the curriculum is that students are not becoming proficient in the target languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pufahl|first=Ingrid|title=What We Can Learn From Foreign Language Teaching In Other Countries|url=http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/0106pufahl.html|publisher=Center for Applied Linguistics|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also note that American students of foreign languages significantly underperform in comparison to their European and Asian counterparts.  It has been suggested that a system where foreign language instruction is required from PK-12 should be implemented in order to fix this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cognitive Benefits of Learning Language|url=http://www.actfl.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=4724|publisher=Online Newsletter for Parents of Gifted Youth|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
Prior to European colonisation, there were hundreds of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]], taught in a traditional way. The arrival of a substantial number of [[Irish language|Irish]] in the first English convict ships meant that European Australia was not ever truly monolingual. When the [[Australian gold rushes|gold rushes]] of the 1850s trebled the white population, it brought many more [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speakers, who had their own language newspapers through to the 1870s, but the absence of language education meant that these Celtic languages never flourished.

Waves of [[Post-war immigration to Australia|European migration after World War II]] brought "community languages," sometimes with schools. However, from 1788 until modern times it was generally expected that immigrants would learn English and abandon their first language.&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;{{broken citation|date=March 2011}} The wave of [[Multiculturalism in Australia|multicultural policies]] since the 1970s has softened aspects of these attitudes.

In 1982 a bipartisan committee of Australian parliamentarians was appointed and identified a number of guiding principles that would support a National Policy on Languages (NPL). Its trend was towards bilingualism in all Australians, for reasons of fairness, diversity and economics.

In the 1990s the Australian Languages and Literacy Policy (ALLP) was introduced, building on the [https://books.google.com/books/about/National_Policy_on_Languages.html?id=IGIcAQAAIAAJ NPL], with extra attention being given to the economic motivations of second language learning. A distinction became drawn between priority languages and community languages. The ten priority languages identified were [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Modern Greek]], [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]].

However, Australia's federal system meant that the NPL and ALLP direction was really an overall policy from above without much engagement from the states and territories. The NALSAS strategy united Australian Government policy with that of the states and territories. It focused on four targeted languages: Mandarin, Indonesian, Japanese and Korean. This would be integrated into studies of Society and Environment, English and Arts.

By 2000, the top ten languages enrolled in the final high school year were, in descending order: Japanese, French, German, Chinese, Indonesian, Italian, Greek, Vietnamese, Spanish and Arabic. In 2002, only about 10% of Year 12 included at least one [[Languages other than English|language other than English]] (LOTE) among their course choices.
In 2009, Lo Bianco and Slaughter, recommended a new approach, stating that “What is needed is a universal apprenticeship in learning how to learn languages”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Second Languages and Australian Schooling | author=Lo Bianco, J | year=2009 | publisher=Australian Council for Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apprenticeship language is a relatively easy language which is taught to overcome the limitations of monolingualism, in preparation for later mastery of a different language or languages. 

Reasons to use an apprenticeship language are:{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

* To make a start when target language teachers are unavailable.
* To master a whole foreign language, for motivation and effective subsequent learning.
* To combat procrastination in the face of diverse priorities in Language education.
* To normalize bilingualism and promote flexibility.
* To model creative problem solving, ethical behaviour and global citizenship.

A resource and method has been devised to implement the ALL approach by equipping generalist primary (elementary) teachers to teach the simple designed language [[Esperanto]] as a [[Propaedeutic value of Esperanto|first, fluent, intercultural, foreign language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Talking to the Whole Wide World: Integrated LOTE and Intercultural Studies for Australian Primary Schools | author=Vos, P | year=2010 | publisher=Mondeto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The professional body for teachers of foreign languages in Australia is the [[Australian Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations]].

'''Lauri Peters''' (born '''Patricia Peterson'''; July 2, 1943) is an American actress, dancer, singer, drama teacher and author.

Peters created the role of Liesl Von Trapp in the original 1959 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''[[The Sound of Music]]''. She received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Supporting or Featured Actress in a Musical, which she shared with her sibling castmates. She was married to actor [[Jon Voight]] (1962–67), whom she met when he joined the cast as [[Nazi]] messenger boy Rolfe, with whom Liesl has a song ("[[Sixteen Going on Seventeen]]") and a mutual attraction. She can be heard on the show's cast album, which has sold more than three million copies in the US.

In Britain, she is probably best known as [[Cliff Richard]]'s romantic lead in the 1963 film ''[[Summer Holiday (1963 film)|Summer Holiday]]''. On film, she also acted alongside [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]], [[James Stewart]] and [[Sidney Poitier]].

She also appeared as Moll in the revival of [[Marc Blitzstein]]'s ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]'' directed by [[Howard Da Silva]]. She appeared on popular television shows of the 1960s and '70s, including ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', but worked primarily in the theater, on and off Broadway, and in touring companies.

With acting teacher [[Sanford Meisner]], Peters founded the Meisner Extension at [[New York University|NYU]] in 1993, where she was Artistic Director and Master Teacher. Teaching the technique away from Manhattan, she has written a book on Meisner.

The '''Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013''' (previously referred to as the "Integrated action programme in the field of lifelong learning" or the "Integrated programme") is the [[European Union]] programme for education and training.

==Introduction==
The Lifelong Learning Programme 2007–2013 was established by ''Decision No.1720/2006/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 November 2006''.&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the [[European Union]] No L327 of 24 November 2006 [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_327/l_32720061124en00450068.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It  is the single financial instrument available to the Commission for its directly managed education and training policies during the period covered by the [[European Union]]'s current [[financial perspective]]. The Programme continues the main actions launched under previous action programmes (in particular, it brings together the various actions financed under the [[Socrates programme]] and the [[Leonardo da Vinci programme]]). It has six sub-programmes:

*The [[Comenius programme]], supporting actions for schools (from pre-primary schools to upper secondary or equivalent)
*The [[Erasmus programme]], supporting exchanges of students in [[higher education]], as well as cooperation between universities and colleges, etc.;
*The [[Leonardo da Vinci programme]], supporting actions in initial and continuing [[vocational education|vocational education and training]] (including student and apprentice exchanges, cooperation between colleges, etc.)
*The [[Grundtvig programme]], supporting actions in the field of [[adult education]]
*The [[Transversal programme]] covering activities in four themed areas across all sectors of education and training: policy cooperation and innovation in education and training; [[Second language acquisition|foreign language teaching]]; development of ICT-based content and services, such as Euroguidance and [[Ploteus]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lifelong Learning Program |publisher=European Union Pprograms Agency |url=http://llp.eupa.org.mt/content.php?id=27 |accessdate=15 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530203736/http://www.llp.eupa.org.mt/content.php?id=27 |archivedate=30 May 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and dissemination of results of the programme;
*The [[Jean Monnet Programme]], supporting institutions and actions in favour of [[European integration]].

==Objectives==
The Programme's objectives&lt;ref&gt;cf article 1.3 of the decision&lt;/ref&gt; are first, to support the development of quality [[lifelong learning]] (a reference to the first paragraphs of Articles 149 and 150 of the [[Treaty of Rome]], which establish the European Union's duties in education and training in those terms); and thereafter to help [[member states of the European Union]] develop their own [[Education|education and training systems]]. Although the objectives are expressed in somewhat abstract terms, they are underpinned by actions which concentrate on the creation of links between people, institutions and countries in education and training – what the programme describes as the "European Dimension" of education and training.

==Actions supported==
The programme supports exchanges and connections between people, institutions and countries within the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]].

===Exchanges between individuals===
These include (for example):

*Erasmus Student exchanges of between 3 and 12 months, in which students leave their home university and follow an agreed part of their course at another university in another country. No additional fees are payable, and the course is recognised by the home institution as part of course-work for the degree. Over 150,000 students did Erasmus student exchanges in the academic year 2005/6, and the cumulative total since 1987 is over 1,500,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html Erasmus website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703000422/http://ec.europa.eu/education/news/erasmus20_en.html |date= 3 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In-service training courses in school or adult education. The Comenius and Grundtvig programmes support participation in specific short &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/trainingdatabase/|title=EUROPA - Socrates Comenius|website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; work placements (internships) for vocational students in companies in another country, to help them complete their skills&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/structure/fiches/leonardo1_en.pdf|title=cf 2007 description at|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exchanges between institutions===
These include (for example):

*Developing partnerships between schools in different countries ("Comenius partnerships") to run joint projects for and with their pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/structure/fiches/comenius6_en.pdf|title=cf 2007 description at|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Similar projects are supported in the field of adult education by the [[Grundtvig programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/structure/fiches/comenius6_en.pdf|title=cf |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Joint projects run by universities in different countries to develop joint curricula, run short-term intensive programmes, or establish thematic networks in different disciplines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/static/en/overview/erasmus_overview.htm|title=Erasmus Overview|website=eacea.ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connections between countries===
These include (for example):

*Study visits for regional and national administrators in education, training and guidance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/structure/fiches/pol1_en.pdf|title=Leonardo da Vinci&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Networks of national experts working together on issues of common interest.&lt;ref&gt;cf the network on ICT in education and training; example of a report at [http://ec.europa.eu/education/doc/reports/doc/ictimpact.pdf] or the History Network providing materials and guidelines for researching,  teaching and learning European History [http://www.cliohworld.net/ CLIOH-WORLD]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Publication of comparable statistics indicating how the various education and training systems are progressing.&lt;ref&gt;cf the [[European Commission|Commission's]] annual "progress report": 2006 version at [http://ec.europa.eu/education/policies/2010/doc/progressreport06.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programme mechanics==
The management of the programme is very largely decentralised to a network of "national agencies", nominated by the participating countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/llp/national_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;  All individual mobility schemes and partnerships, and many multilateral projects, will be funded through these agencies. A limited number of projects will be handled centrally either by the [[European Commission]] itself or through its [[Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency]] – a public agency funded by the Commission and operating on its behalf.&lt;ref&gt;http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Programme has an indicative total budget of €6.970 billion over the seven years 2007–2013. Minimum seven-year allocations for each of the four bigger programmes are laid down&lt;ref&gt;cf Annex B.11 of the decision&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

*Comenius: 13% (€0.906 billion)
*Erasmus: 40% (€2.788 billion)
*Leonardo da Vinci: 25% (€1.743 billion)
*Grundtvig: 4% (€0.279 billion)

The remaining budget is to be spent on other actions and administrative costs. Experience of previous programmes suggests that the final seven-year budget will slightly exceed the current estimate&lt;ref&gt;As was the case for the previous [[SOCRATES programme|Socrates]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci Programme]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Folk Museum of Korea''' is a national museum of [[South Korea]], located within the grounds of the [[Gyeongbokgung Palace]] in [[Jongno-gu]], [[Seoul]], and uses replicas of historical objects to illustrate the history of traditional life of the Korean people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asemus.museum/museum/national-folk-museum-of-korea/|title=National Folk Museum of Korea - Asia-Europe Museum Network|work=Asia-Europe Museum Network|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum was established on 8 November 1945 by the U.S. Government and opened on 25 April 1946 at the City Administration Memorial Hall. When the museum was merged with [[National Museum of Korea]], its collection of 4,555 artifacts was moved to the latter's [[Namsan (Seoul)|Mt Namsan]] site. In 1975, when the National Museum moved onto the grounds of [[Gyeongbokgung Palace]], it moved along with it into the Modern Art Museum Building. In 1993 it opened in its present site, which was the former site of the National Museum of Korea. The building's design is based on various historical buildings around South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;NFMK [http://www.nfm.go.kr:8080/english/htm/muse2_history.htm History: The National Folk Museum of Korea] Retrieved 2011-11-04&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
The museum has three main exhibition halls, with over 98,000 artifacts: '''History of Korean People''' features materials of everyday life in Korea from prehistoric times to the end of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] in 1910; '''Korean Way of Life''',  which illustrates Korean villagers in ancient times; and '''Life Cycle of the Koreans''', which depicts the deep roots of Confucianism in Korean culture and how this ideology gave rise to most of the culture's customs.

The museum also features open-air exhibits, such as replicas of spirit posts where villagers used to pray, stone piles for worship, grinding mills, rice storage shelters and pits for kimchi pots.

The '''National Information Standards Organization''' ('''NISO''') is a [[United States]] non-profit [[standards organization]] that develops, maintains and publishes technical standards related to publishing, bibliographic and [[library]] applications. It was founded in 1939, incorporated as a not-for-profit education association in 1983, and assumed its current name in 1984.

== Organization ==
NISO offers two membership categories, "voting members" and "library standards alliance".  In January 2016, the "voting members" included 77 large corporations, mostly publishers, and large library organizations such as the [[American Library Association]].&lt;ref name="NISOmembership"&gt;"[http://www.niso.org/about/roster/ Member companies]". National Information Standards Organization. Retrieved March 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Voting members elect Directors and comment and vote on standards.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.niso.org/about/join/membership/ NISO Voting Members]". National Information Standards Organization. Retrieved March 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Library Standards Alliance" included 135 members, primarily university and large public libraries.&lt;ref name="NISOmembership" /&gt; Library members receive free access to NISO webinars.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.niso.org/about/join/alliance Library Standards Alliance]". National Information Standards Organization. Retrieved March 6, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd Carpenter was appointed Executive Director of NISO in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lj.libraryjournal.com/2006/08/ljarchives/niso-names-todd-carpenter-managing-director/ NISO names Todd Carpenter managing director]". ''Library Journal''. August 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
NISO is accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) and is designated by ANSI to represent U.S. interests to the [[International Organization for Standardization]]'s Technical Committee 46 (Information and Documentation). In 2008, NISO was appointed Secretariat on behalf of ANSI for the TC 46 Subcommittee 9 ([[TC 46/SC 9]]) - Identification and Description.

NISO approved standards are published by ANSI. Unlike most other ANSI standards, all of NISO standards and best practices are freely available from its web site.

Designations (names) of NISO standards all start with "ANSI/NISO Z39." (read zee or zed thirty nine dot).

Examples of NISO standards include:
*Z39.2: Bibliographic records [[ISO 2709|Information Interchange Format]] (IIF) encoding mostly used with [[MARC standards]]
*Z39.29: [[Bibliographic References]]; last version is Z39.29-2005 (R2010)
*Z39.5: [[journal title abbreviation]]s, resulting in the 1969 publication of the [[American National Standard for the Abbreviation of Titles of Periodicals]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Bulletin of the Medical Library Association | date = July 1971 | volume = 59 | issue = 3 | pages = 420–9 | title = MEDLARS abbreviations for medical journal titles | vauthors = Charen T, Gillespie CJ | PMID =  5146764 | pmc=197609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Z39.50]]: a protocol for accessing bibliographic databases
*Z39.83: [[NISO Circulation Interchange Protocol]] (NCIP) for library catalogue data exchange
*Z39.84: [[Digital object identifier]] (DOI)
*Z39.85: [[Dublin Core]]
*Z39.86: Specifications for the Digital Talking Book: [[DAISY Digital Talking Book|DAISY Digital Accessible Information SYstem]]

'''Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego''' is a nonprofit run by the [[University of California, San Diego]]. It was founded as a company in 2001 by [[Sally Ride]], America's first woman in space, along with [[Tam O'Shaughnessy]], Karen Flammer, Terry McEntee, and Alann Lopes to inspire young people in [[science, technology, engineering, and math]] (STEM) and to promote STEM literacy.&lt;ref name="aboutus-company"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sallyridescience.com/about/|title=Sally Ride Science—About|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=change-the-equation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://changetheequation.org/commitment-to-excellence/sally-ride-science-inc|title= Change the Equation|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="temporal-dynamics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tdlc.ucsd.edu/about/about-sally-ride-science.html|title=Sally Ride Science officially joins TDLC as a corporate partner.|accessdate=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sally Ride Science was relaunched at UC San Diego on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowler|first1=Matthew|title=Sally Ride Science becomes part of UC San Diego|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2015/oct/26/sally-ride-science-becomes-part-uc-san-diego/|website=[[KPBS Public Media|KPBS]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based at UC San Diego Extension, and its programs are coordinated jointly by UC San Diego Extension, [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]], and [[San Diego Supercomputer Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Piercey|first1=Judy|last2=Davies|first2=Jennifer|title=Sally Ride Science launches at UC San Diego|url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/feature/sally_ride_science_launches_at_uc_san_diego|website=UCSD News|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Shaughnessy is executive director and Flammer is director of education for Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego.

Sally Ride Science at UC San Diego focuses on professional development for teachers; K-12 STEM + Arts (STEAM) education, including courses, lectures, and camps; and online programs through UCTV.&lt;ref name=kpbs-srs /&gt; The goal is to help educators build students’ STEM literacy and make connections between what students are learning and the STEM fields that are expected to experience rapid job growth in the coming decades. The nonprofit will create new programs and make use of existing Sally Ride Science programs.

Existing programs include ''Cool Careers in STEM'', which provides professional development for teachers and classroom resources (student books, teacher guides, and a STEM Career Connections Teacher Activity Guide) to awaken students’ interest in STEM topics and careers. Research shows that learning about STEM careers and the diverse people working in these fields inspires students and makes the study of science, technology, engineering, and math more meaningful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Practice Guides: Encouraging Girls in Math and Science|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncer/pubs/practiceguides/20072003.asp|website=National Center for Education Research|accessdate=10 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major existing program is ''Key Concepts in Science''. This integrated standards-based program provides professional development for educators on how to teach science using the [[5E instructional model]], along with classroom resources (student books, hands-on investigations, teacher guides, and assessments) that educators can use to build students’ STEM literacy and college and career readiness. The program reflects research showing that teaching fewer science concepts in greater depth gives students a solid foundation to develop STEM literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Next Generation Science Standards|url=http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards|website=[[Next Generation Science Standards]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before its acquisition by UC San Diego, Sally Ride Science implemented a variety of STEM-related educational initiatives. The company:
* organized 100 Sally Ride Science Festivals on college campuses around the country.&lt;ref name="SRS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Homepage|url=https://sallyridescience.com|website=Sally Ride Science|accessdate=11 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111130712/https://sallyridescience.com/|archivedate=11 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* created and ran a National Engineering Design (TOYchallenge) competition for eight years and created a documentary film (''Some Assembly Required'') following five teams of boys and girls during the 2008 competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://student.societyforscience.org/article/toy-challenge|title=^"TOYchallenge: A toy design contest encourages both girls and boys to take an interest in engineering."|website=Student Science|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* created 90 STEM and STEM careers books with comprehensive teacher guides, and more than 200 hands-on STEM investigations.&lt;ref name="SRS"/&gt;
* developed and held the Sally Ride Science Academy for six years, using a train-the-trainer model.
* trained more than 30,000 teachers and reached more than 6 million students with STEM and STEM careers books.&lt;ref name="SRS" /&gt;
* operated EarthKAM (based on Sally Ride's idea to let students take photos of Earth from space and use them in their studies), engaging more than 600,000 students and their teachers in 80 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Young Scientists|url=http://global.jaxa.jp/article/interview/vol59/index_e.html|website=JAXA|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* helped spark the national discussion and shift the national perspective on the importance of involving girls and underrepresented minority students in STEM as they go through school and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marklein|first1=Mary Beth|title=Astronaut Sally Ride’s educational legacy lives on|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2013/05/16/astronaut-sally-rides-educational-legacy-lives-on/2164575/|website=USA Today|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Megan Taylor Meier''' (November 6, 1992 – October 17, 2006) was an American teenager who died by [[suicide]] by [[Suicide by hanging|hanging herself]] three weeks before her 14th birthday. A year later, Meier's parents prompted an investigation into the matter and her suicide was attributed to [[cyberbullying]] through the [[social networking]] website [[Myspace|MySpace]]. Lori Drew, the mother of a friend of Meier, was indicted on the matter in 2008, but was acquitted in the 2009 case ''[[United States v. Drew]]''.&lt;ref name="drop appeal"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/11/lori-drew-appeal/|title=Prosecutors Drop Plans to Appeal Lori Drew Case|last=Zetter|first=Kim|date=November 20, 2009|work=[[Wired News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Megan Taylor Meier was born on November 6, 1992, to Christina "Tina" Meier and Ronald "Ron" Meier&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Frankel|first=Todd C|title=Megan Meier's mom is still fighting bullying|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/metro/megan-meier-s-mom-is-still-fighting-bullying/article_f901d3e0-b6b8-5302-ac0c-80b83c9703a9.html|accessdate=4 November 2012|newspaper=stltoday.com|date=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[O'Fallon, Missouri]], a northern [[St. Louis]] suburb. During Megan's childhood she lived in the nearby [[Dardenne Prairie, Missouri|Dardenne Prairie]]. She had a younger sister.

From the third grade, after she had told her mother she had wanted to kill herself, Megan had been under the care of a [[psychiatrist]]. She had been prescribed [[citalopram]] (an [[antidepressant]] that has a possible [[Antidepressants and suicide risk|side effect of increasing suicide risk]] in young people&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zetter |first1=Kim |title=Dead Teen's Mother Testifies about Daughter's Vulnerability in MySpace Suicide Case -- Update |url=https://www.wired.com/2008/11/lori-drew-pla-1/ |publisher=''[[Wired News]]'' |accessdate=March 20, 2015 |date=November 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[methylphenidate]], and the atypical [[antipsychotic]] [[ziprasidone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lauren Collins |date= January 21, 2008 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/01/21/080121fa_fact_collins |publisher=The New Yorker |title= Annals of Crime.

Meier attended [[Fort Zumwalt School District|Fort Zumwalt public schools]], including Pheasant Point Elementary School and [[Fort Zumwalt West Middle School]]&lt;ref name="nytimeshoax"/&gt; in nearby O'Fallon, Missouri. 
Megan befriended the popular girls so that the boys who picked on her would stop. The girls soon turned on Megan and the bullying got even worse than before. For eighth grade, her parents enrolled her at Immaculate Conception Catholic School&lt;ref name="nytimeshoax"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/28/us/28hoax.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin ''A Hoax Turned Fatal Draws Anger but No Charges''], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; in Dardenne Prairie. 

Soon after opening an account on MySpace, Meier received a message supposedly from a 16-year-old boy, Josh Evans. Meier and "Josh" became online friends, but never met in person or spoke. Meier thought "Josh" was attractive. As Meier began to exchange messages with this person, her family said she seemed to have had her "spirits lifted". This person claimed to have moved to the nearby city of [[O'Fallon, Missouri|O'Fallon]], was [[homeschooling|homeschooled]] and did not yet have a phone number.

A 16-year-old male named "Josh Evans" was registered on the account used for bullying messages to Meier. But Lori Drew, the mother of Sarah Drew, a former friend of Meier, later admitted creating the MySpace account. At the time of the suicide, the Drew and Meier families were neighbors, living four doors apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/frail-egos-caught-in-killer-net/2007/11/30/1196394619060.html?page=3 ''Frail egos caught in killer net''], ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 30 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lori Drew was aided by Sarah and by Ashley Grills, an 18-year-old employee of Lori. Lori and several others ran the hoaxed account. Witnesses testified that the women intended to use Meier's messages sent to "Josh" to get information about her and later humiliate her, in retribution for her allegedly spreading gossip about Drew's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Cyberbullying case goes to jury |url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2008/11/25/Cyberbullying_case_goes_to_jury/UPI-57271227624011/ |quote=They say Drew created a false 16-year-old male persona in an attempt to woo Meier and extract information from her to determine if she had been spreading gossip about her daughter. |work=[[United Press International]] |date= |accessdate=2008-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4560582&amp;page=1 Exclusive: Teen Talks About Her Role in Web Hoax That Led to Suicide]."

===Suicide===
On  October 16, 2006, the tone of the messages changed. After Megan got home from school, Tina Meier signed onto MySpace for Megan. She was in a hurry because she had to take her younger daughter, Allison, to the orthodontist. Before she could get to the door, Megan was upset. "Josh" sent troubling messages to Megan, including one that said: "I don't know if I want to be friends with you anymore because I've heard that you are not very nice to your friends."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bZ9cNtlNBpoC&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;ots=B4l2X9nPf5&amp;dq=%22I%20don't%20know%20if%20I%20want%20to%20be%20friends%20with%20you%20anymore%20because%20I've%20heard%20that%20you%20are%20not%20very%20nice%20to%20your%20friends%22&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true ''Rich, Free, and Miserable: The Failure of Success in America''], John Brueggemann, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2010, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; More messages of this type were sent, some of Megan's messages were shared with others, and bulletins were posted about her. Tina told her daughter to sign off, and went to the orthodontist. She called her daughter to ask her if she signed off, and she didn't. Megan was sobbing hysterically. When her mother got home, she was furious that she hadn't signed off. She was shocked at the vulgar language her daughter was firing back. Megan then told her mother, "You're supposed to be my mom! You're supposed to be on my side!" and then left from the computer and went upstairs. According to her father Ron Meier and a neighbor who had discussed the hoax with Drew, the last message sent by "Josh" read: "Everybody in O'Fallon knows who you are. You are a bad person and everybody hates you. Have a shitty rest of your life. The world would be a better place without you".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ml8RDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Everybody%20in%20O'Fallon%20knows%20who%20you%20are.%20You%20are%20a%20bad%20person%20and%20everybody%20hates%20you.%20Have%20a%20shitty%20rest%20of%20your%20life.%20The%200000world%20would%20be%20a%20better%20place%20without%20you%22&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Bullied: Tales of Torment, Identity, and Youth''], Keith Berry, Routledge, 2016, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

Megan responded saying, "You're the kind of boy a girl would kill herself over." The last few exchanges were made via [[AOL Instant Messenger]] instead of MySpace. When she ran upstairs, she ran into her father. She told him about the trouble and went to her room. Ron went downstairs to the kitchen where he and Tina talked about the cyberbullying and made dinner. Twenty minutes later, Tina suddenly froze in mid-sentence, and ran up to Megan's room. Megan Meier had hanged herself with a belt in the bedroom closet. Despite attempts to revive her, Megan was pronounced dead the next day on October 17, three weeks before her 14th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Story?id=3882520 Parents: Cyber Bullying Led to Teen's Suicide: Megan Meier's Parents Now Want Measures to Protect Children Online] 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Investigation==

===Local===
Several weeks after her death, Megan Meier's parents were told that the mother of one of their daughter's friends—with whom Meier had a falling out—had created the "Josh Evans" account. The parent, Lori Drew, who created the [[Sockpuppet (Internet)|fake account]], admitted that she and her daughter had the password to the account, and characterized the hoax to a reporter as a "joke". Initially, Drew denied knowing about the offensive messages that were sent to Meier. She told the police that the account was aimed at "gaining Megan's confidence and finding out what Megan felt about her daughter and other people". The neighborhood mother who had told the Meiers that Drew had the hoax account said "Lori laughed about it", and said she had intended to "mess with Megan".

While Drew's name was excluded from most early news stories, [[CNN]] disclosed her name through the inclusion of the police report in its broadcast of the story; it was featured on many [[blog]]s.&lt;ref name="Pokin1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://suburbanjournals.stltoday.com/articles/2007/11/11/news/sj2tn20071110-1111stc_pokin_1.ii1.txt |title='' 'MySpace' hoax ends with suicide of Dardenne Prairie teen'' |author=Pokin, Steve |publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=2007-11-11 |accessdate=2007-11-16 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/web/americas-most-reviled-mother/2007/11/30/1196394672124.html|title=''How Lori Drew became America's most reviled mother''|date=2007-12-01|work=The Age|location=Melbourne|accessdate=2007-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was more than a year between Meier's suicide and the first media report of the Internet hoax. The [[FBI]] was investigating the matter and had asked the Meier family to refrain from speaking publicly about it to keep the Drews from learning about their investigation. Shortly after the first anniversary of Meier's death, her aunt, Vicki Dunn, saw an article written by Steve Pokin of the ''[[Suburban Journals]]'' about Internet harassment. She contacted Pokin to share Meier's story with him. Once the story broke, it quickly spread to national and international news outlets.&lt;ref name="nytimeshoax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pokin1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stevepokininterview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="netharass1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stcharlesjournal.stltoday.com/stevepokin/2007/10/something-more-disturbing-than-litter.html |title=Something more disturbing than litter came unwanted into this house |publisher=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |date=2007-10-21 |accessdate=2007-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709154447/http://stcharlesjournal.stltoday.com/stevepokin/2007/10/something-more-disturbing-than-litter.html |archivedate=2009-07-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a press conference on December 3, 2007, Jack Banas, the prosecuting attorney of [[St. Charles County]], said that Lori Drew's 18-year-old temporary employee, Ashley Grills, wrote most of the messages addressed to Meier and that she wrote the final "Josh Evans" message addressed to Meier. Grills said she wrote the final message to end the [[Myspace]] hoax and get Meier to stop communicating with "Josh Evans".&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; Banas stated that he did not interview Grills because, at the time, she was under psychiatric treatment for her participation in the Meier case. He did not plan to interview her at a later date.

The Meiers criticized the prosecutor's statements, saying that Banas did not interview any party other than the Drews and that Banas was solely relying on the testimony of the Drews. Banas said that the original FBI investigation into the matter, during which Grills was interviewed, established her role in the event. The Meiers have said they do not hold Grills responsible for Megan's death.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Lauren. [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/01/21/080121fa_fact_collins ''Friend Game''], ''[[The New Yorker]]'' 21 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Banas said Sarah Drew, by then 15, was attending a different school and not living in Dardenne Prairie. He said Lori Drew was fearful of telling him where her daughter lives. According to Lori Drew's attorney, she had to close her advertising business in the wake of publicity about her role in the Internet account and messages. Neighbors shunned the Drews following the revelations.&lt;ref name="cnn1207"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/wayoflife/12/07/suicide.shunning.ap/index.html |title="Neighbors shun MySpace hoax family" |accessdate=2007-12-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211213244/http://www.cnn.com/2007/LIVING/wayoflife/12/07/suicide.shunning.ap/index.html |archivedate=December 11, 2007 |df= }}. ''[[Associated Press]]'' at ''[[CNN]]''. December 7, 2007. Retrieved on September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet webloggers posted photographs, telephone numbers, e-mail details, and addresses of the Drews and the employee on various websites.&lt;ref name="cnn1207" /&gt; Businesses that advertised in Drew's coupon book business were also shunned.&lt;ref name="netvig"&gt;Hutcheon, Stephen. [http://www.theage.com.au/news/web/vigilantes-target-myspace-mum/2007/12/07/1196812986566.html?page=1 ''Net vigilantes target MySpace mum'']. ''[[The Age]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Wells, a weblogger who revealed the [[given name|given]] and [[family name|family]] names of Lori Drew, said, "I don't regret naming Drew."  After reviewing the case, county prosecutors decided not to file any criminal charges in relation to the hoax.

===Federal===
{{Main|United States v. Drew}}

Lori Drew was indicted and convicted by a jury of violations of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]] in 2008 over the matter. Her conviction was vacated by a federal judge on a post-trial verdict, on grounds that the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act did not intend to criminalize the conduct of which Drew was accused.  The government chose not to appeal this post-trial ruling. &lt;ref name="drop appeal"/&gt;

==Reactions==
When Megan Meier's story was first reported in the ''[[St. Charles Journal]]'', readers were concerned about the unnamed adults implicated in the hoax.&lt;ref name="Pokin1"/&gt; Later, the focus was on the decision by the St. Louis ''[[Suburban Journals]]''' decision not to print the names of the Drews. In an interview, the reporter said that names had been withheld to protect the minor child in the family.&lt;ref name="stevepokininterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gelfmagazine.com/gelflog/archives/who_deserves_anonymity.php |title=''Who Deserves Anonymity?'' |publisher=[[Gelf magazine]] |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webloggers learned and reported the names of Lori and Gary Drew, after they found the latter in minutes.&lt;ref name="womanouted"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0,25642,22783456-5014108,00.html?from=mostpop |author=Ramadge, Andrew |title=''Woman linked to teen girl's suicide outed'' |publisher=news.com.au |date=2007-11-19 |accessdate=2007-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120020237/http://www.news.com.au/technology/story/0%2C25642%2C22783456-5014108%2C00.html?from=mostpop |archivedate=2007-11-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="internetfury"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/news/2007/11/vigilante_justice |author=Zetter, Kim |title=''Cyberbullying Suicide Stokes the Internet Fury Machine'' |publisher=Wired News |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media eventually revealed Lori Drew's name and published her photograph.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3929774|title=''Parents Want Jail Time for MySpace Hoax Mom''|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Banas said he was aware of the national outrage against the Drews, which originated on the Internet in response to the Steve Pokin article in the ''O'Fallon Journal''.&lt;ref name="update"&gt;"[http://suburbanjournals.stltoday.com/articles/2007/12/03/news/doc47543edb763a7031547461.txt ''UPDATE: No charges to be filed over Meier suicide'']. ''Suburban Journals''. 3 December 2007.{{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Drews have had their home and work addresses, phone and cell phone numbers, and aerial photos of their home posted on the Internet. The Drews' property had also been vandalized. Banas said some of these actions against the Drews could constitute [[cyberstalking|Internet stalking]].&lt;ref name="update"/&gt;

"Because we can't prosecute somebody it certainly does not justify violating the law," Banas said. "We live in this country by the rule of the law." He described Lori Drew as "upset, cautious and guarded" when he interviewed her.

The crowd gathered in a nearby parking lot and walked past the homes of the Meiers and the Drews. A small piece of ground adjacent to the Drews' house was the scene of remembrances by friends of the Meiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccworlds.com/worlds/index_files/dardenne_prairie/meierwalk.htm |title=Candlelight vigil held in honor of Megan Meier |publisher=sccworlds.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222014832/http://www.sccworlds.com/worlds/index_files/dardenne_prairie/meierwalk.htm |archivedate=2008-12-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has caused several [[jurisdictions]] to enact or to consider [[legislation]] prohibiting [[harassment]] over the [[Internet]]. The Board of Aldermen for the City of Dardenne Prairie passed an [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] on November 22, 2007, in response to the incident.&lt;ref name="sockpuppet"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2178820/ |title=''The Sock Puppet Who Loved Me'' |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| author=Goldstein, Bonnie |date=2007-11-29 |accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ordinance prohibits any harassment that utilizes an electronic medium, including the Internet, text messaging services, pagers, and similar devices. Violations of the ordinance are treated as misdemeanors, with fines of up to $500 and up to 90 days imprisonment. The city of [[Florissant, Missouri|Florissant]], [[Missouri]] also passed a "Cyber Harassment" law, with other municipalities, counties, and states considering following suit. The state of Missouri is to revise its harassment laws in response to the case,&lt;ref&gt;Cathcart, Rebecca. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/10/us/10myspace.html?ref=us "MySpace Is Said to Draw Subpoena in Hoax Case"]. ''The New York Times''. 10 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; updating them to cover harassment through computers and mobile phone messaging, and creating a new crime to cover adults 21 and over harassing children under the age of 18.

The new legislation went into effect on August 28, 2008, and was intended to cover loopholes in the current law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.house.mo.gov/billcentral.aspx Missouri House of Representatives: House and Senate Joint Bill Tracking] Web form (enter code SB818 to view the bill)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''St. Louis Daily Record'', the "new language expands the definition of the crime of 'harassment' to include knowingly intimidating or causing emotional distress anonymously, either by phone or electronically, or causing distress to a child." It also "increases the penalty for harassment from a [[misdemeanor]] to a [[felony]], carrying up to four years in prison, if it’s committed by an adult against someone 17 or younger, or if the criminal has previously been convicted of harassment." This is one of the first comprehensive [[cyberbullying]] and [[cyberstalking]] state laws that protects children and adults from harassment on social networking sites. The bill is a reaction to Lori Drew's case dismissal&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and Governor [[Matt Blunt]], the politician who signed the law into effect states, "[Missouri] needs tough laws to protect its children." A bill was introduced in the [[111th Congress]] on April 2, 2009 as H.R. 1966. Both houses of the Missouri State Legislature voted unanimously on May 15, 2008 to criminalize usage of the internet to harass someone, the existing statute was expanded to prohibit abusive ''"communication by any means..."'' and is known as "Megan's Law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney |first=Lance |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10320274-38.html |title=news.cnet.com |publisher=news.cnet.com |date=2009-08-28 |accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (not to be confused with New Jersey's and subsequent federal [[Megan's Law]]).

'''The National Museum of Computing''' is a [[museum]] in the [[United Kingdom]] dedicated to collecting and restoring [[History of computing hardware|historic computer systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = The National Museum of Computing | url = http://www.tnmoc.org/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum is based in rented premises at [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Milton Keynes]], [[Buckinghamshire]]&lt;ref name="museumsassociation.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/30112016-national-museum-of-computing-involved-in-setting-up-cyber-security-training-college|title=National Museum of Computing involved in setting up cyber security college - Museums Association|website=www.museumsassociation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in 2007. The building — ''Block H'' — was the first purpose-built computer centre in the world, hosting six [[Colossus computer]]s by the end of World War II.

The museum houses a rebuilt Mark 2 Colossus computer alongside an exhibition of the most complex code cracking activities performed at the Park, along with examples of machines continuing the history of the development of computing from the 1940s to the present day. The museum has a policy of having as many of the exhibits as possible in full working order.

Although located on the Bletchley Park 'campus', The National Museum of Computing is an entirely separate charity with its own fund raising and separate entrance/ticketing. TNMOC receives no public funding and relies on the generosity of donors and supporters. 

The museum is working with four other organisations, in a group called Qufaro, to create the 
[[National College of Cyber Security]] for students between 16 and 19 years of age. To open in 2018, the school will be located in Block G which was being renovated in 2017, funded by the Bletchley Park Science and Innovation Centre. (Bletchley Park Trust has no involvement with the college.) &lt;ref name="museumsassociation.org"/&gt;

==Exhibits==
On display in the museum are many famous early computing era machines, including a functioning [[Colossus computer|Colossus Mark 2]] that was rebuilt between 1993 and 2008 by a team of volunteers led by [[Tony Sale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/pods/coltalk_2.html|title=coltalk_2|website=www.codesandciphers.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Colossus – The Rebuild Story | publisher = The National Museum of Computing | url = http://www.tnmoc.org/colossus-rebuild-story | accessdate = 13 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Colossus was a machine that helped break [[Germany|German]] [[encryption]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = UK computer history gets new home | publisher = BBC News | date = 11 July 2007 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6291422.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Image:ColossusRebuild 11.jpg|thumbnail|upright|A team led by [[Tony Sale]] reconstructed a [[Colossus computer|Colossus Mark 2 computer]] at Bletchley Park. Here, in 2006, Sale supervises the breaking of an enciphered message with the completed machine.]]

The museum also includes the world's oldest working digital computer (the [[Harwell computer|Harwell Dekatron / WITCH]]), machines from the 1960s such as the [[Marconi Transistorised Automatic Computer (T.A.C.)]], [[Elliott 803]] and 905, an [[ICL 2900|ICL 2966]] mainframe from the 1980s, a wide range of [[analogue computer]]s, a hands-on [[retrocomputing]] gallery, and several restoration projects such as the [[PDP-8]] and the [[PDP-11]]-based [[air traffic control]] system from [[London Terminal Control Centre]] at [[West Drayton]] near London. Further exhibits include mechanical and electronic calculators, a history of slide rules, a pair of [[Cray]] supercomputers, and a personal computing gallery with ten hands-on machines. Visitors can also see a re-build of the Cambridge University [[EDSAC]] computer that is underway (still in progress as of September 2017.)

There is also a suite which includes many BBC Micro personal computers which are used to encourage programming among visitors, an area dedicated to women in computer science, and a hands on display of video game consoles from different eras. All of this is alongside various other displays of devices and information regarding the evolution of computing from the 60s to the modern era.

At the end of 2009, an [[Internet]] gallery, sponsored by the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] (NPL) where [[packet switching]] was first developed, was opened.

Another area includes a range of mechanical and [[electro-mechanical]] [[punched card]] machines, exhibiting how computation was achieved prior to the digital computer.

The museum also features a cafe/gift shop.

Demonstrations and talks usually occur on the hour when the galleries are open, with slight deviation depending on the number of visitors.

The rest of the museum is open to the public every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons and most bank holidays, and by appointment for groups only at other times. There are guided tours on Tuesday afternoons, Thursday mornings and other times. There is a modest admission charge to the museum to help cover overheads (including rent).

==Funding==
TNMOC depends for funding entirely on voluntary and corporate donations and modest admission charges. Fundraising continues and donors have included Bletchley Park Capital Partners, [[Fujitsu]], [[Google]] UK, CreateOnline, [[Ceravision]], Insight software&lt;!-- not [[Insight Enterprises]]--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.insightsoftware.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[PGP Corporation]], [[IBM]], NPL, [[HP Labs]], [[British Computer Society]] (BCS), Black Marble, and the School of Computer Science at the [[University of Hertfordshire]].

The museum conducted a crowdfunding campaign in March 2018 to raise funds to build a new gallery for the [[Turing-Welchman Bombe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnmoc.org/explore/turing-welchman-bombe|title=Turing-Welchman Bombe|publisher=The National Museum of Computing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign raised over £43,000 via crowd-funding and an additional £20,000 via direct donations.

The museum is managed by the Codes and Ciphers Heritage Trust, a registered charity,&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|1109874|CODESANDCIPHERS HERITAGE TRUST}}&lt;/ref&gt; with employed and volunteer staff. The title ''The National Museum of Computing'' is an operating name.

== History ==
===Origins===
The University of Agriculture, Faisalabad ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جامعہ زرعيه فيصل آباد}}}}), (formally: ''Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute''), is a [[university]] in the city of [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It was established in 1906&lt;ref name=uaf&gt;http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].

At independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.

The 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.

UAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] 

The university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 5,000 students and approximately 3,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Haley Hall]].

==Organisation and administration==
===Faculties and departments===
UAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences. A community college is on the main [[campus]] in [[Faisalabad]]. The College of Veterinary Sciences at [[Lahore]] was affiliated and is now a distinct entity known as the [[University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences|University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore]] (UVAS).

These units offer programmes leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in agriculture and allied fields. [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] ranks the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad as the best in the agriculture/veterinary field in Pakistan. The University of Agriculture [[Faisalabad]] ranked number 4 among the top 10 universities in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Documents/Ranking_Doc%20(2015).pdf, Ranking 2015- Overall Top 10 Higher Education Institutions, ranking table listings by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC), a [[Government of Pakistan]] governing body, Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Courses of study lead to the degrees of Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Engineering, Food Engineering, Textile Technology,; M.Sc. in Food Technology, Fibre Technology, Agricultural Engineering; and Doctor of Philosophy in Food Technology and Agricultural Engineering.
The Food Engineering Department has the highest merit since 2013 &amp; leading in the country with phenomenal and creative engineers.

Department of Agricultural Engineering &amp; Technology was established in 1961 when the Punjab Agriculture College, [[Lyallpur]] was given the status of University of Agriculture, [[Lyallpur]]. The main objective of the faculty was to train manpower to cater to the growing needs of mechanized farming in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. This is one of the pioneer faculties in the field of agriculture in Pakistan.

====Department of Farm Machinery and Power====
The department is one of the prime departments of the Faculty of Agricultural Engineering and Technology.

This department, in collaboration with other departments, offers a baccalaureate program in Agri. Engineering.

====Department of Structures &amp; Environmental Engineering====
The department provides facilities like updated research laboratories, lecture rooms for undergraduate and postgraduate students, and computer laboratory. A wide range of state-of-the-art equipment has been provided to facilitate high tech research work.

====Department of Irrigation &amp; Drainage====

====Department of Fibre and Textile Technology====
The department of Fibre Technology was established in the Faculty of Agriculture Engineering &amp; Technology in 1964. It is the sole department in the country which offers a master's degree programme in Fibre Technology. The main objective of this department is to impart scientific knowledge and technological training to the students in the field of Fibre science, Textile Technology (spinning, knitting, dyeing, finishing, testing &amp; quality control), pulp, paper and cardboard technology to meet the demand of the fast growing industry.

Candidates who hold degrees in biological sciences are considered for graduate admission in non-clinical subjects. The students are enrolled for the degree of Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Pharm. D, M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees. Prof Dr. Ahrar Khan is Dean.

====Faculty of Social Sciences====

The Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, established in 1963, with its constituent departments of Agricultural Economics, Farm Management, Agricultural Marketing, Cooperation and Credit and Rural Sociology, has now been functioning for over 51 years in the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. It has endeavored to keep abreast with requirements in terms of academic programmes/activities over these years. However, looking at the likely shape of agricultural development, the direction and quality of research and the make-up of trained manpower output in the discipline of agricultural social sciences, the future trends need to be looked into seriously so as to be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

A perusal of the functioning of the constituent departments of the faculty showed that over the years the programmes of some of the departments had become less demanding in academic and research output in line with the present day requirements. Especially under WTO set up, where there has been a shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture putting further pressure to shift the emphasis to resource management strategy. Therefore, there was a strong need for a meaningful restructuring and fine tuning of the faculty to meet the challenges of the emerging requirements of the economy in the coming years.

Keeping in view this need of time, the Faculty was restructured in 2012. The name of faculty was changed to Faculty of Social Sciences. The departments of Agricultural Economics, Development Economics, and Environmental &amp; Resource Economics were merged into a new institute, Institute of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (IARE). Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq is the first director of IARE, having served from June 2012.

Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics now offers degree programs serving the needs of society:

The '''University of Technology, Mauritius''' ('''UTM''') is a public research [[university]] in [[Mauritius]]. The main campus lies in La Tour Koenig, Pointe-aux-Sables, within the district of Moka. It was founded following the government of [[Mauritius]] approval of the setting up of the University of Technology, Mauritius in January 2000 and the proclamation of The University of Technology, Mauritius Act on 21 June 2000.

UTM is a member of the [[Association of Commonwealth Universities]] and is listed in the Commonwealth Universities Handbook and in the International Handbook of Universities. UTM is a member of the [[Southern African Regional Universities Association]] (SARUA) - a network of public universities in the [[Southern African Development Community|SADC]] region.

==Organisation==
[[Image:Utm convocation.jpg|thumb|2008 Convocation Ceremony]] The setting up of the university began with the merging of two public training institutions, the Mauritius Institute of Public Administration and Management and the State Information Training Centre into schools. The School of Business Informatics and Software Engineering, the School of Public Sector Policy and Management and the School of Sustainable Development Science became operational in September 2000. The university started a restructuring process in September 2008. The schools were respectively renamed as School of Innovative Technologies and Engineering, School of Business Management and Finance and School of Sustainable Development and Tourism.

In-company training is part of the curriculum in the tourism management programmes. It offers programmes on a part-time and distance basis as well as flexible entry and exit points. Many of the programmes are occupationally or vocationally directed, for example, banking and finance, tourism management and marketing, and software engineering.

It offers short course programmes such as a full-time course for higher executive officers for 15 weeks. In this orientation and approach it differs from traditional universities in the SADC.&lt;ref&gt;Glenda Kruss and Il-haam Petersen. [http://www.sarua.org/?q=content/chapter-5-analysing-university-firm-interaction-sadc-countries "Chapter 5: Analysing University-Firm Interaction in the SADC Countries"], ''SARUA Study Series 2008: Towards a Common Future: Higher Education in the SADC Region'', South Africa, December, 2008. &lt;!--accessed March 19, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is internationally recognised.

Courses are run within the main campus in La Tour Koenig and its satellite centres in La Tour Koenig, Bell Village and Moka. The building of a new campus near Moka, is underway to sustain its expansion.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Hilbert. [http://www.lexpress.mu/services/epaper-84830-b-education-superieure-un-nouveau-campus-pour-8-000-etudiants-a-highlands-b.html "ETUDES SUPERIEURES Un campus pour 8 000 étudiants à Highlands"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719042021/http://www.lexpress.mu/services/epaper-84830-b-education-superieure-un-nouveau-campus-pour-8-000-etudiants-a-highlands-b.html |date=19 July 2011 }}, ''L'Express'', Mauritius, 11 January 2010. &lt;!--accessed February 13, 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

UTM tuition fees are non-subsidised, as opposed to the [[University of Mauritius]] (UoM). A Tertiary Education Commission study revealed that the percentage of students satisfied with respect to course delivery was higher at the UTM as compared to the UoM.&lt;ref&gt;Tertiary Education Commission.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6635">Austrian '''Viktor Lowenfeld''' (1903–1960) was a professor of [[art education]] at the [[Pennsylvania State University]]. His ideas influenced many art educators in post-war United States. In particular, he emphasized "ways in which children at different stages of artistic development should be stimulated by appropriate media and themes, and...the curriculum...guided mainly by developmental considerations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title= United States of America: Art Education |author=Douglas C. Allen |encyclopedia =[[Grove Art Online]] |accessdate = July 2016 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in [[Linz]], [[Austria]] in 1903, Viktor Lowenfeld had always been drawn to the arts.  Through his personal narration, Lowenfeld mentioned that he was pulling toward music at an early age – probably four or five.  He started to play violin at the age of nine or ten.  And because he used to play by ear, rather than reading notes, he was often called a “Gypsy.”  That same year Lowenfeld started painting.  This early exposure to the visual and performing arts led him to a career devoted to the practice of educating himself and the public in art.

Dr. Lowenfeld graduated from the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna|College of Applied Arts]] in [[Vienna]], as well as the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]] in the same city.  He later received his doctorate in Education from the University of Vienna, and during this time served as an elementary and secondary school teacher.  While in Vienna, he also served as the director of art in the Blind Institute.  In 1938 Lowenfeld fled to England before arriving in the United States.  He became a citizen in 1946 after serving in the Navy as a wartime visual aids consultant.

Lowenfeld joined the [[Hampton University|Hampton Institute]] in Virginia in 1939 as assistant professor of Industrial Arts, studio art teacher, and later Chairman of the Art Department.  In 1945 he was named curator of the distinguished collection of Black African Art at the Hampton Institute.  Lowenfeld came to The Pennsylvania State University as professor of Art Education in 1946.  Ten years later he became head of the newly founded Department of Art Education.  He stayed in this position until his death in 1960.
Dr. Lowenfeld is well known for his Visual-Haptic theory in Art Education which was assimilated from Viennese sources.  He always regarded good teaching as a dialogue, therefore his motivation and evaluations had a strong Expressionist bias.  His psychological training enabled him to gain a therapeutic position in his early months in America, labeling him a “Viennese Psychologist” in Time.  He was an active leader in the [[National Art Education Association]] and The National Committee on Art Education.

According to Peter Smith, “Lowenfeld is still a name of power in American art education.  Although his own death, and the deaths and retirements of his disciples, have lessened Lowenfeldian political in academia (and therefore in teacher education), his concepts go marching on.”&lt;ref&gt;Lowenfeld in a Viennese Perspective:  Formative Influences for the American Art Educator, Journal of Studies in Art Education&lt;/ref&gt;  Lowenfeld’s philosophy reached a large audience through the theories documented in his books:  ''Genesis of Sculpturing'', 1932; ''Sculptures by the Blind'', 1934; ''The Nature of Creativity'', 1938; ''Creative and Mental Growth'', 1947; and ''Your Child and his Art''.  He also published numerous articles on art education aesthetics, art for the handicapped, black art, and testing.  He published more than one hundred articles.  

Among his students was the American muralist [[John T. Biggers]].

== Creative and Mental Growth ==
Lowenfeld's 1949 ''Creative and Mental Growth'' was published and became the single most influential textbook in art education. Many elementary school teacher preparation programs used this book since it described characteristics of child art. Lowenfeld believed evidence of [[aesthetic]], [[social]], [[Child development#Physical growth|physical]], [[intellectual]], and [[emotional]] growth is reflected in the art of children.  

He further developed a theory of stages in artistic development. The stages consisted of
#scribble;
#preschematic;
#schematic;
#Dawning Realism;
#Pseudorealism; and
#Period of decision/crisis.

Lowenfeld's ideas of art as a catalyst of creativity have prompted many research dissertations in the field of [[art education]].

== The Lowenfeld Memorial Collection ==
Viktor Lowenfeld left behind an association of friends and followers including Edward L. Mattil who helped establish the Viktor Lowenfeld Memorial Fund.  Dr. Mattil, at the time of Dr. Lowenfeld’s death, was also asked to serve as head of the Department of Art Education.  The Memorial Fund was administered by a local committee composed of Elizabeth Yeager, Yar Chomicky, George Pappas, Walter C. Reid, and George S. Zoretich; and by the National Committee which included Kenneth R. Beittel, Mayo Brice, F. Louis Hoover, Edward L. Mattil, Charles M. Robertson and D. Kenneth Winebrenner.  The national memorial provided moneys for research papers by eminent scholars every second year at the NAEA convention.  About five such papers have been delivered.  The money of the local committee was spent to purchase sculpture, trees, and plaques for a memorial garden area at [[Penn State College of Education]].  During this drive, graduated students contributed paintings, sculptures, and drawings to the Lowenfeld Memorial Collection.

The contributions are still welcomed today.  The collection which amounts to more than seventy works is located within the Arts Cottage, the Chambers Building, the Cedar Building, and the Rackley Building at the University Park Campus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5542">'''Walter Andre Goffart''' (born February 22, 1934), born a Belgian, came to America in 1941, is a historian of the later [[Roman Empire]] and the early [[Middle Ages]] who specializes in research on the [[barbarian kingdoms]] of those periods. He taught for many years in the History Department and Centre for Medieval Studies of the University of Toronto (1960-1999), and is currently a senior research scholar at [[Yale University]].

A 1955 graduate of [[Harvard University]], Goffart received his doctorate there in 1961. He is the recipient of numerous distinguished awards and fellowships and was awarded the [[Haskins Medal]] of the Medieval Academy of America in 1991 for his book "The Narrators of Barbarian History."

Alexander C. Murray edited a ''[[Festschrift]]'' for Goffart called ''After Rome's Fall: Narrators and Sources of Early Medieval History'' (1999).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3558">'''Walter T. Foster''' (1891–1981) was an American entrepreneur, artist, art instructor, writer, editor and publisher. The Walter Foster Publishing Company's line of low-cost art manuals were widely distributed to art stores, often displayed in a metal rack specially made for Foster's oversized art books. Today, Walter Foster Publishing is part of the Quayside Publishing Group, which is owned by [[Quarto Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120303110150/http://www.walterfoster.com:80/about/history.php About Us], walterfoster.com. Retrieved 3 September 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laguna Beach artists and books==
While residing in [[Laguna Beach, California]], Foster owned and operated an advertising agency, where he worked with many local artists and illustrators. Through his friends in the art community, he discovered many artists who wanted to teach art and write books. In response, Foster started a publishing company in his home, where he wrote, illustrated, printed, bound, packaged, shipped and distributed the books himself. An artist in his own right, Foster created the company’s first title, ''How to Draw'', which sold more than one million copies and is still in print today. Foster died in 1981 at the age of 90, at which time his family took over company operations.

One of Foster's most notable artists was [[Preston Blair]], whose book, ''Animation'', sold more than one million copies and is still in print today. Another noteworthy artist, [[Hal Rasmusson]] (''[[Aggie Mack]]''), wrote ''Modern Cartoon''. Roger Armstrong (''[[Ella Cinders]]'', ''[[Napoleon and Uncle Elby]]'') was the author of ''How to Draw Comic Strips'' (1990).

==Walter Foster Publishing==
In 1988, a group of investors comprising Andrew McNally IV (former president of [[Rand McNally]]), Illinois businessman Rhett Butler, attorney Paul Hegness and California businessman and former [[Price Waterhouse]] CPA Ross Sarracino purchased the Walter Foster Publishing Company. With Sarracino at the helm, the company began developing instructional drawing and painting books for children.

The popularity of these children’s books eventually led to licensing agreements with [[The Walt Disney Company]], [[Nickelodeon]], [[Hasbro]], [[Marvel Entertainment]], [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros.]]. Walter Foster Publishing's Walt Disney books and activity kits have sold more than 4,500,000 copies since 1991.

In 1996, Quarto Publishing, under direction of CEO Laurence Orbach, acquired Walter Foster Publishing, leaving Sarracino at the helm as President and CEO. In addition to growing its publishing and custom packaging (creating books and kits for [[Baker &amp; Taylor]], [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Chronicle Books]], [[Disney Press]], [[Michaels]], [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], [[TJ Maxx]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]]) business, Foster teamed with [[MEDL Mobile]] to create the [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/learn-to-draw-digital-sketchbook/id384300160?mt=8 Learn to Draw Digital Sketchbook] [[Application software|app]] for the [[iPad]]. Since the app became available in December 2010, it has been downloaded over 200,000 times.

'''Yusuf Grillo''' (born 1934) is a [[contemporary art|contemporary]] [[Nigerian]] artist known for his inventive works and the prominence of the color blue in many of his paintings. 

He was president of the Society of Nigerian Artists.

==Life==
Grillo was born in [[Lagos]] and attended Nigerian College of Arts, Science and Technology, [[Zaria]], where he received a [[diploma]] in [[Fine Arts]] and a post-graduate diploma in education. In 1966, he left Zaria for study at the academic halls of [[Cambridge University]] and later traveled to Germany and the United States of America.

Grillo is considered one of Nigeria's outstanding and academically trained painters; he emerged to prominence and international recognition in the 1960s and 1970s, while exhibiting a large collection of his early works. He makes use of his western art training in many of his [[paintings]], combining western art techniques with traditional [[Yoruba traditional art|Yoruba]] [[sculpture]] characteristics. His preference for color blue in natural settings paintings, is sometimes similar to the [[adire (textile art)|adire]] or resist-[[dye]] textiles used in Nigeria. He is a former Head of the Department of Art and Printing at [[Yaba College of Technology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/02/art-life-will-till-die-yusuf-grillo/|title=Art is my life, it’s what I will do till I die — Yusuf Grillo|publisher=The Vanguard|date=February 25, 2015|accessdate=April 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Falola&gt;Toyin Falola, Christian Jennings.
