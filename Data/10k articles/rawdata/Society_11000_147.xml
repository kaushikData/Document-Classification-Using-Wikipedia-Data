      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4336">'''Allen Raymond''' is a former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Political consulting|political consultant]] in the  [[United States]] who spent three months in federal prison for his role in the [[2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal]], for which he was convicted of making harassing phone calls across state lines, a felony.&lt;ref name=kranish&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/06/10/fallen_star_blames_self_gop_tactics/ "Fallen star blames self, GOP tactics: Jail term served in N.H. phone plot"] By Michael Kranish, ''[[Boston Globe]]'' June 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Raymond is the author of the book, ''How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative'' (2008).

==Phone jamming scandal==
{{see also|2002 New Hampshire Senate election phone jamming scandal}}
Raymond told investigators that his former [[Republican National Committee]] colleague [[James Tobin (political operative)|James Tobin]] approached him with a plan to tie up the phones of New Hampshire Democrats on [[Election Day (politics)|Election Day]] 2002, during a close Senate race between Republican [[John E. Sununu]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Jeanne Shaheen]]. At the time, Raymond owned a Virginia-based GOP phone-bank company ([[GOP Marketplace]]) and also held a paid position as Executive Director of the [[Republican Leadership Council]].

Raymond then collected $15,600 from the New Hampshire Republican State Committee and paid a small Idaho telemarketing company $2,300 to make non-stop hangup phone calls to six New Hampshire phone lines, five of which were being used by the Democratic Party to get out the vote. The sixth phone line belonged to the [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] Firefighters' Union, which offers free rides to the polls.

In an interview with the ''[[Boston Globe]]'', Raymond said he took part in the phone-jamming because he "had been reluctant to turn down a prominent official of the RNC, fearing that would cost him future opportunities from an organization that was becoming increasingly ruthless."&lt;ref name=kranish/&gt;

==''How to Rig an Election''==

The closing paragraph of his book ''[[How to Rig an Election]]: Confessions of a Republican Operative'' ends with a line that reflects on a conversation with his wife just before he entered jail; "After ten full years inside the GOP, ninety days amongst honest criminals wasn't any great ordeal."&lt;ref&gt;''How to Rig an Election: Confessions of a Republican Operative'' ({{ISBN|1-4165-5222-7}})&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Bigamy Act 1604''' (1 Jac 1 c 11) was an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] of the [[Kingdom of England]]. It created the offence of [[bigamy]] as a capital [[felony]]. Bigamy had not previously been a temporal offence (that is to say, within the jurisdiction of the common law courts as opposed to the ecclesiastical courts).&lt;ref&gt;R v. Taylor [1950] 2 All ER 170, CCA&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|... if any persons or persons within his Majesty's Dominions of England and Wales, being married, or which hereafter shall marry, do at any time after the end of the session of this present Parliament, marry any person or persons, the former husband or wife being alive ... then every such offence shall be felony ...

Provided always, that neither this Act, nor anything therein contained, shall extend to any person or persons whose husband or wife shall be continually remaining beyond the seas by the space of seven years together, or whose husband or wife shall absent him or herself the one from the other by the space of seven years together, in any parts within his Majesties Dominions, the one of them not knowing the other to be living within that time.}}

'''Cannabis in Guatemala''', as of 2016, is illegal. [[Otto Pérez Molina|Otto Pérez]], when he was president of the country, tried to lead a legalization drive, and some congressmen tried to pass a law for legalization, but those efforts failed. A poll conducted in 2012 said that 41% of Guatemalans might support decriminalization.  

==History==
One early law restricting cannabis was Decree 1331 of 1932, which restricted "plantas letales" to include "Indian hemp and marihuana".&lt;ref name="Policía1935"&gt;{{cite book|author=Guatemala. Dirección General de Policía|title=Memoria de los trabajos realizados por la Dirección General de la Policía Nacional durante el año de ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J_hWAAAAYAAJ|year=1935|publisher=Tipografía Nacional|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, former Guatemalan president Otto Pérez announced his support for decriminalizing drugs, but he said that the United States boycotted his plans. He nevertheless tried to promote the idea in diverse forums, culminating in a speech he gave before the United Nations General Assembly in New York on 26 September 2012. A poll in that year revealed that 41% of Guatemalans thought that decriminalization was a good idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/plan-de-legalizar-droga-coincidio-con-conexion-z|title=Plan de legalizar droga coincidió con conexión Z|last=Ramos|first=Gerson|last2=Álvarez|first2=Carlos|date=June 10, 2017|website=Prensa Libre|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171106182818/http://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/politica/plan-de-legalizar-droga-coincidio-con-conexion-z#|archive-date=2017-11-06|dead-url=no|access-date=6 Nov 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the Commission of legislation and constitutional points of Congress (Spanish: Comisión de Legislación y Puntos Constitucionales del Congreso) in Guatemala rejected the ''Law to regulate the cultivation, production, distribution, commercialization, medicinal and recreational consumption of cannabis'' (Spanish: ''Ley para Regular el Cultivo, Producción, Distribución, Comercialización y Consumo Medicinal y Recreativo del Cannabis)'' as "unfeasible, inopportune, and unconstitutional". The law had been proposed in April of that year by the congressmen from the party Convergencia. [[Alvaro Velázquez]], one of the congressmen, had said he would keep trying for the initiative to advance &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Milena Lopez |url=http://www.tn8.tv/cronica-tn8/373406-comision-rechaza-uso-medicinal-marihuana-guatemala/ |title=Comisión Rechaza Uso Medicinal De La Marihuana En Guatemala |publisher=Tn8.tv |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Juan Toro |url=http://clustersalud.americaeconomia.com/guatemala-rechazan-uso-marihuana-medicinal/ |title=Guatemala: Rechazan uso de marihuana medicinal - Cluster Salud, La Industria de la vida |publisher=Clustersalud.americaeconomia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he died in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/justicia/localizan-cadaver-del-diputado-alvaro-velasquez-en-la-casa-donde-habitaba-en-mixco|title=Localizan cadáver del diputado Álvaro Velásquez en una casa, en Mixco|last=Bolaños|first=Rosa|last2=Gamarro|first2=Urias|date=July 29, 2017|website=Prensa Libre|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171106062406/http://www.prensalibre.com/guatemala/justicia/localizan-cadaver-del-diputado-alvaro-velasquez-en-la-casa-donde-habitaba-en-mixco#|archive-date=2017-11-06|dead-url=no|access-date=Nov 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conviction and sentences ==
According to Guatemalan law, cannabis is illegal, as of 2016, and a person convicted of personal consumption of a drug (including cannabis) would be sentenced to a minimum of 4 months in jail and a 200 quetzals fine, and up to 5 years and a 10,000 quetzals fine, but because "personal consumption" is not defined properly, the prosecutor can accuse the person of traffic and the judge may give a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tni.org/es/publicacion/reforma-de-la-ley-de-drogas-en-guatemala-guia-basica#1|title=Reforma de la ley de drogas en Guatemala: guía básica|last=|first=|date=30 July 2015|website=tni|archive-url=https://archive.today/20171107083022/https://www.tni.org/es/publicacion/reforma-de-la-ley-de-drogas-en-guatemala-guia-basica%231#1#1|archive-date=2017-11-07|dead-url=no|access-date=7 Nov 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chuckmuck''' is a belt-hung leather and metal tinder pouch. It is a distinct design of a flint-and-steel fire-lighting kit. It is also used as ethnic jewellery  amongst Tibetans and Mongolians.

==Description==
The chuckmuck is constructed from a stiff leather purse with a thick curved steel striker attached by rivets to its base. The sides and flap of the purse are either sewn or fixed by ornamental metal plates or small plaques. Inside are kept a piece of flint and a little tinder (pulped woody material such as plant roots). On the top fold a thin metal plate with 1 - 3 small hooks allows the pouch to be hung from the belt with a chuckmuck strap: a chain, leather thong or embroidered cloth.

Chuckmucks vary in size and decoration, with the circular boss in the centre of the flap, which operates as a hook to keep the purse closed, sometimes being decorated by a semi-precious stone such as coral or turquoise. Other decorations on the mounts are in silver, brass or iron with geometric patterns, floral designs, Tibetan motifs, or in the [[animal style]].&lt;ref&gt;J.N.Roerich 1930 'the animal style among the nomad tribes of Northern Tibet'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asianart.com/articles/thogchags/|title=John Vincent Bellezza: Thogchags, Ancient Amulets of Tibet|work=asianart.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steel striker is occasionally engraved: with two dragons&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O89544/tinder-pouch-unknown/ |title=Tinder pouch &amp;#124; V&amp;A Search the Collections |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2015-08-10 |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Chinese characters]]. The [[University of Washington]] database contains a collection of fire steels including early chuckmucks on plates 45-48 from several countries.&lt;ref name=abr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~mlw2/tmp/steel/plates |title=Steel plate images |publisher=Arl.wustl.edu |accessdate=2015-08-15 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chuckmuck is hung from the belt in both Mongolian and Tibetan traditional dress for men and women. For this reason it is sometimes described as a [[Chatelaine (chain)]] with strap ornaments, as in the [[British Museum]] exhibit.&lt;ref name=brx&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?museumno=1924,0620.12.a|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes accompanied by a 'chuckmuck purse' as a jewellery set&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pinterest.com/stoneroutes/|title=Bradley Rowe|work=Pinterest}}&lt;/ref&gt; in exactly the same style only lacking the curved steel striker.

==History==
The container for a [[fire striker|flint-and-steel]] kit can come in two main forms: the tinderbox&lt;ref name=br1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colonialsense.com/Antiques/Other_Antiques/Early_Lighting/The_Common_Tinder-Box.php|title=Colonial Sense: Antiques: Other Antiques: Early Lighting: The Common Tinder-Box|work=colonialsense.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tinder pouch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/fire.html|title=Methods of Making Fire - Pitt Rivers Museum|author=Pitt Rivers Museum|work=ox.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire lighting kit for 'striking a light' was essential until the gradual introduction of the [[match]] in the mid 19th century. The form of the chuckmuck is so different from other tinder pouches worldwide that categorising them together is misleading.{{or|date=August 2015}} The decorated stiff leather purse of the chuckmuck with its attached curved striker make it a design classic.{{peacock term|date=August 2015}}

The chuckmuck design appears in many cultures from the 17th century&lt;ref name="abr"/&gt; or earlier, stretching from the [[Silk Road]] to the [[Himalaya]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=As1983,07.115.a|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for As1983,07.115.a|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; and China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=As1878,1230.956|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for As1878,1230.956|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=As1911,1007.1|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for As1911,1007.1|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Japan&lt;ref name=aby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/21861/lot/109/|title=Bonhams|work=bonhams.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.batemans.com/lot.php?lot=124695|title=Batemans|work=Batemans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not known where or when the design originated, but it was manufactured locally in several countries in Central Asia.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} One known, still active, hub of metalwork was the area between Lanzhou, Xining and [[Labrang]], the NE part of [[Amdo]] which incorporates the Amdo Tibetans, some Mongol regions, the [[Salar people|Salar]], the [[Hui people|Hui]] and Han Chinese.

The 19th-century growth in museums and world expositions in several countries led to many exhibits on the theme of man making fire and several of these included examples of chuckmucks. As a result, many museums and old collections contain chuckmucks; they occasionally appear in antique auctions.&lt;ref&gt;National Museum of Scotland Museum reference A.1927.661&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-brass-mounted-tinder-pouch-or-chuckmuck-chinese-4631465-details.aspx?pos=7&amp;intObjectID=4631465&amp;sid=&amp;page=8&amp;lid=1|title=A brass-mounted tinder pouch or "chuckmuck"|author=Christie?s|work=christies.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/21835/lot/14/|title=Bonhams|work=bonhams.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 a British museum of Fire-Making Appliances catalogued 52 of these chuckmucks and illustrated 11.
"Of all tinder-pouches, by far the handsomest and most interesting are those commonly known by this name, which form an exceeding well-marked group. All come from one part of the world covering Tibet, the Himalayan region, Mongolia and Northern China." &lt;ref&gt;The Bryant and May Museum of Fire-Making appliances: catalogue of the exhibits" London 1926 (and supplement 1928) pages 66-73 and 221&lt;/ref&gt;
The whole museum collection was transferred to [[the Science Museum]] in 1937 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/about_us/collections/about_the_collections/collections_snapshot/bryant_and_may_collection.aspx |title=The Bryant &amp; May collection of fire-lighting devices - About us |publisher=Science Museum |date=2007-02-12 |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collectionsonline.nmsi.ac.uk/info.php?s=chuckmuck&amp;type=all&amp;t=objects |title=Chuckmuck images |publisher=Collectionsonline.nmsi.ac.uk |accessdate=2015-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums worldwide today classify them in a variety of different ways: "pouch (tinder flint)"&lt;ref name=brx /&gt; "tinder pouch ('mecha')'&lt;ref name="abr" /&gt; fire-striker, flint-steel set etc  and rarely mention the chuckmuck design to distinguish it from other pouches.

==Etymology==
[[File:Chuckmuck straps- mechag style (Tibet)- cloth and leather belt straps for suspending chuckmucks photo Stone Routes.JPG|thumb|Mechag style cloth and leather belt straps for suspending chuckmucks]]
Chuckmuck is derived via the British Indian word ''chakmak'' &lt;ref&gt;Ivor Lewis 1991 Sahibs, nabobs and boxwallahs: a dictionary of the words of Anglo-India&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Turkish language|Turkish]] word for flint, ''çakmaktaşı''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tureng.com/search/flint|title=Tureng - flint - Turkish English Dictionary|work=tureng.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This word of Turkic origin was simplified and incorporated as slang in many languages of Central Asia. When encountered in British India during contact with Himalayan Tibetan tribes, it became identified as a particular form of fire-steel - the chuckmuck.  Since this coincided with the introduction of the friction [[match]], the function of the [[tinderbox]] and tinder pouch gradually became unnecessary, and by the end of the 19th century, only its use as ethnic jewellery by Mongolians and Tibetans kept the chuckmuck in daily use.

===Chuckmuck===
For a few decades in mid 19th century, ''chuckmuck'' and ''chakmak'' were used almost interchangeably as the ‘Indian’ word for any type of fire-steel.

The first known use of the word ''chuckmuck'' comes from 1843 from British India: ''“the coolness of the British soldier is shewn by his sitting down and lighting his chuckmuck and enjoying the solace of his pipe while the arrows of death were bustling around his ears”''.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Elder, and Company, 1843 The British Friend of India Magazine, and Indian Review&lt;/ref&gt;

In central India, north west of Mumbai, a British officer &lt;ref&gt;Henry Astbury Leveson 1860 The hunting grounds of the Old world, by 'The old shekarry'&lt;/ref&gt; describes a local guide: ''“Round his waist was a broad leather belt, hung round with numerous pouches…and a chuckmuck, or leather bag, with flint, steel and tinder.”'' This would best be described as a tinder pouch, and, that of the pipe smoking soldiers a simple metal tube with striker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southpadretv.tv/making-sparks-a-brief-history-of-firemaking-1640|title=Making Sparks a Brief History of Firemaking|work=southpadretv.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A camping book in 1871 details ''"a very convenient and portable means of carrying fire, sold under the name of "strike-a-light" or "chuckmuck"; it is formed of a brass tube of 1in. caliber and 3in. in length, which has a cap and a sliding bottom to it : it is filled of tinder….it contains also a gun flint or bit of agate, and its chain passes through an oval of steel or case-hardened iron”'' costing around a shilling &lt;ref&gt;W.B. Lord &amp; T. Baines 1871 Shifts and expedients of camp life, travel &amp; exploration&lt;/ref&gt; - clearly one of the plethora of short-lived metal tinderbox designs.

However, after the 1889 publication of Hindu-koh&lt;ref&gt;Donald Macintyre 1889 Hindu-Koh: Wanderings and Wild Sport on and Beyond the Himalayas&lt;/ref&gt; by Donald Macintyre (VC), a prominent British Gurkha officer, containing the first known illustration and description of a chuckmuck, the word became more strictly defined in academic circles. Macintyre actually made his hunting trip, on which the book is based, in the Himalaya in 1853-4, and was a prominent fellow of the Royal Geographical Society and other Indian societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Macintyre,_Donald_(DNB12)|title=Macintyre, Donald (DNB12)|work=wikisource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum categorisation of ''chuckmuck'' dates from this time. After that, all academic descriptions, where they were catalogued in English, used the word to refer to the classic design of the chuckmuck. ''Chakmak'' does not appear to have been used as a descriptive term outside India.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.Cruse 1946 Match-box Labels of the World: With a History of Fire-making Appliances from Primitive Man to the Modern Match&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chuckmuck'' was defined as an Anglo-Indian word.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Henry Yule 1903 Anglo-English Words and Phrases.&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be used in books in English about the history of fire-lighting.&lt;ref&gt;Ad Van Weert Dutch Lighter Museum 1995 The Legend of the Lighter&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chakmak===
Catholic missionaries had a presence in Western Tibet from 1624 to 1640. The initial reports of the Jesuit [[António de Andrade]], including dictionaries, were supplemented by many others in the 19th century on the eastern fringes of the Tibetan plateau, leading to an 1899 dictionary&lt;ref&gt;Société des Missions Étrangères, 1899. Les Missionaire Catholiques du Thibet: Dictionnaire Tibétain-Latin-Français&lt;/ref&gt; citing ''lcags ma'' and ''lcags mag'', pronounced as ''chagmag'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Sándor Kőrösi Csoma|Alexander Csoma de Koros]] 1834 A Dictionary of Tibetan and English&lt;/ref&gt; as vulgar slang for ''me lcags'', itself often transliterated as ''mechag''.&lt;ref&gt;Thubten Jigme Norbu, Colin Turnbull 1968 Tibet&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nepal, a traditional [[kukri]] features two little knives attached at the back of the sheath. One is called a ''chakmak''. It is blunt on both sides and it works like a knife sharpener or when struck on a lime stone creates sparks to start fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khukuriblades.com/kukri_history/|title=Kukri history:: Khukuri history:: Khukri history:: Origin of Gurkha knife/kukri|work=khukuriblades.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chakmak'', as an Indian word, was widely used in reports and books in British India. ''“In Ladakh both men and women wore in their waste-clothes or girdles a chakmak (or leather case ornamented with brass, containing a flint, steel and tinder)”''.&lt;ref&gt;Raj Kumar 2006.  Paintings and lifestyles of Jammu Region : from 17th to 19th century A.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Moorcroft (explorer)|William Moorcroft]], extensively catalogued the Himalayan regions around Ladakh in the 1820s, noting ''“Every man carries a knife hanging from his girdle, and a chakmak,or steel for striking a light”''. As he was describing Tibetan dress, these were of the classic chuckmuck design.&lt;ref&gt;William Moorcroft 1841 Travels in the Himalayan Provinces of Hindustan  From 1819 to 1825&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891 [[William Woodville Rockhill]] recorded some of [[Salar language]], an archaic Turkic dialect spoken near Lanzhou between the Tibetan plateau and Mongolia. He derived the Salar word ''cha’-ma'' from [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] ''chakmak''.&lt;ref&gt;WW Rockhill  1894 Diary of a journey through Mongolia and Tibet&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in [[Uyghur language]], a Turkic language spoken in western China, the word for flint is ''chaqmaq teshi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uighurdictionary.com/?s=flint|title=flint - Search Results  - English Uyghur Dictionary|work=uighurdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Persian and Arabic, ''chakmak'' means "flint" or "fire-striker".&lt;ref&gt;John Richardson 1829 A Dictionary, Persian, Arabic, and English&lt;/ref&gt;  An early example dated 1716 is from Persia, where the Islamic inscription reads ''“The fire steel (''chakmak'') of his heart is so filled with sparks that his charged sight intensifies the burning”'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arl.wustl.edu/~mlw2/tmp/steel/catalogue.pdf plate 35.201]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kyrgyz language]], as noted by an 1899 Danish expedition, the ''"apparatus for striking fire is called Chakmak. It is possible that flint is found by this lake of Chakmaktinkul and that the name may arise therefrom in relation to the striking of fire from flint"''.&lt;ref&gt;the Second Danish Pamir Expedition 1898-99 Through the Unknown Pamirs&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Image:Death poem by Kuroki Hiroshi.jpg|frame|The ''jisei'', or death poem, of Kuroki Hiroshi, a Japanese sailor who died in a [[Kaiten]] suicide torpedo accident on 7 September 1944. It reads: "This brave man, so filled with love for his country that he finds it difficult to die, is calling out to his friends and about to die".]]
}}
The '''death poem''' is a genre of [[poetry]] that developed in the literary traditions of [[East Asia]]n cultures—most prominently in [[Culture of Japan|Japan]] as well as certain periods of [[Chinese history]] and [[Joseon Korea]]. They tend to offer a reflection on death—both in general and concerning the imminent death of the author—that is often coupled with a meaningful observation on life. The practice of writing a death poem has its origins in [[Zen Buddhism]]. It is a concept or worldview derived from the [[Buddhist]] teaching of the {{nihongo|[[three marks of existence]]|三法印|sanbōin}}, specifically that the material world is transient and {{nihongo|[[Impermanence|impermanent]]|無常|mujō}}, that attachment to it causes {{nihongo|[[dukkha|suffering]]|苦|ku}}, and ultimately all reality is an {{nihongo|[[śūnyatā|emptiness or absence of self-nature]]|空|kū}}. These poems became associated with the literate, spiritual, and ruling segments of society, as they were customarily composed by a poet, warrior, nobleman, or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Bhikkhu|monk]].

The writing of a poem at the time of one's death and reflecting on the nature of death in an impermanent, transitory world is unique to East Asian culture. It has close ties with Buddhism, and particularly the mystical [[Zen Buddhism]] (of Japan), [[Chan Buddhism]] (of China) and [[Seon Buddhism]] (of Korea). From its inception, Buddhism has stressed the importance of death because awareness of death is what prompted the Buddha to perceive the ultimate futility of worldly concerns and pleasures. A death poem exemplifies both the "eternal loneliness" that is found at the heart of Zen and the search for a new viewpoint, a new way of looking at life and things generally, or a version of enlightenment (''[[satori]]'' in Japanese;'' [[Wu (Chinese religion)|wu]]'' in Chinese). According to comparative religion scholar [[Julia Ching]], [[Japanese Buddhism]] "is so closely associated with the memory of the dead and the ancestral cult that the family shrines dedicated to the ancestors, and still occupying a place of honor in homes, are popularly called the ''Butsudan'', literally 'the Buddhist altars'. It has been the custom in modern Japan to have [[Shinto wedding]]s, but to turn to Buddhism in times of bereavement and for funeral services".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Ching]], "Buddhism: A Foreign Religion in China. Chinese Perspectives", in [[Hans Küng]] and Julia Ching (editors), ''Christianity and Chinese Religions'' (New York: Doubleday, 1989), 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

The writing of a death poem was limited to the society's literate class, ruling class, samurai, and monks. It was introduced to Western audiences during World War II when Japanese soldiers, emboldened by their culture's [[samurai]] legacy, would write poems before suicidal missions or battles.&lt;ref&gt;Mayumi Ito, ''Japanese Tokko Soldiers and Their Jisei''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Style and technique===
The poem's structure can be in one of many forms, including the two traditional forms in Japanese literature: [[Kanshi (poetry)|kanshi]] or [[waka (poetry)|waka]].{{efn|"Kanshi" is a Chinese-style poem written in Chinese characters by a Japanese poet; while "waka", which literally means "Japanese poem", is written in lines alternating between 5 and 7 syllables}} Sometimes they are written in the three-line, seventeen-syllable [[haiku]] form, although the most common type of death poem (called a ''jisei'' 辞世) is in the waka form called the [[tanka]] (also called a ''jisei-ei'' 辞世詠) which consists of five lines totaling 31 syllables (5-7-5-7-7)—a form that constitutes over half of surviving death poems.(Ogiu, 317-318).

Poetry has long been a core part of Japanese tradition. Death poems are typically graceful, natural, and emotionally neutral, in accordance with the teachings of [[Buddhism]] and [[Shinto]]. Excepting the earliest works of this tradition, it has been considered inappropriate to mention death explicitly; rather, [[metaphor]]ical references such as sunsets, autumn or falling [[cherry blossom]] suggest the transience of life.

It was an ancient custom in Japan for literate persons to compose a ''jisei'' on their deathbed. One of earliest records was recited by [[Prince Ōtsu]], executed in 686. For examples of death poems, see the articles on the famous haiku poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Bashō]], the Japanese Buddhist monk [[Ryōkan]], [[Ōta Dōkan]] (builder of [[Edo Castle]]), the monk [[Gesshū Sōko]], and the Japanese woodblock master [[Yoshitoshi|Tsukioka Yoshitoshi]]. The custom has continued into modern Japan. Some people left their death poems in multiple forms. Prince Ōtsu made both waka and kanshi, [[Sen no Rikyū]] made both kanshi and [[kyōka]].

On March 17, 1945, General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]], the Japanese commander-in chief during the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]], sent a final letter to Imperial Headquarters. In the message, General Kuribayashi apologized for failing to successfully defend Iwo Jima against the overwhelming forces of the United States military. At the same time, however, he expressed great pride in the heroism of his men, who, starving and thirsty, had been reduced to fighting with rifle butts and fists. He closed the message with three traditional death poems in ''[[waka (poetry)|waka]]'' form.

In 1970, writer [[Yukio Mishima]] and his disciple [[Masakatsu Morita]] composed death poems before their attempted coup at the [[Ichigaya]] garrison in Tokyo, where they committed the ritual suicide of [[Seppuku]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Keene]], ''[[The Pleasures of Japanese Literature]]'', p.62&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not compose any formal death poem on his deathbed, the last poem written by the great poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] (1644-1694) recorded by his disciple [[Takarai Kikaku]] during his final illness is generally accepted as his poem of farewell:

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

Despite the seriousness of the subject matter, some Japanese poets have employed levity or irony in their final compositions. The Zen monk, Tokō (杜口; 1710–1795, aged 85), commented on the pretentiousness of some jisei in his own death poem:

This poem by Moriya Sen'an (d. 1838) showed an expectation of an entertaining afterlife:

in a tavern.
With luck
the cask will leak.&lt;ref name=Hoffmann/&gt;{{rp|81}}&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The final line, "hopefully the cask will leak" (''mori ya sen nan)'', is a play on the poet's name, Moriya Sen'an.

Written over a large calligraphic character 死 ''shi'', meaning Death, the Japanese Zen master [[Hakuin Ekaku]] (白隠 慧鶴; 1685-1768) wrote as his jisei:

==Korean death poems==
Besides Korean Buddhist monks, Confucian scholars called [[seonbi]]s sometimes wrote death poems (절명시).  However, better-known examples are those written or recited by famous historical figures facing death when they were executed for loyalty to their former king or due to insidious plot.  They are therefore impromptu verses, often declaring their loyalty or steadfastness.  The following are some examples that are still learned by school children in Korea as models of loyalty.  These examples are written in Korean [[sijo]] (three lines of 3-4-3-4 or its variation) or in [[Hanja]] five-syllable format (5-5-5-5 for a total of 20 syllables) of ancient Chinese poetry (五言詩).

===Yi Gae===
[[Yi Gae]] (이개·1417–1456) was one of "[[six martyred ministers]]" who were executed for conspiring to assassinate [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]], who usurped the throne from his nephew [[Danjong of Joseon|Danjong]]. Sejo offered to pardon six ministers including Yi Gae and Seong Sam-mun if they would repent their crime and accept his legitimacy, but Yi Gae and all others refused.  He recited the following poem in his cell before execution on June 8, 1456.  In this [[sijo]], Lord (임) actually should read ''someone beloved or cherished'', meaning King Danjong in this instance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sijomunhak.com/gnu4/bbs/board.php?bo_table=gosijo&amp;wr_id=143&amp;sfl=&amp;stx=&amp;sst=wr_hit&amp;sod=asc&amp;sop=and&amp;page=4 Korean Sijo Literature Association]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|방안에 혔는 촛불 눌과 이별하엿관대
겉으로 눈물지고 속타는 줄 모르는다.
우리도 천리에 임 이별하고 속타는 듯하여라.}}

Oh, candlelight shining the room, with whom did you part?
You shed tears without and burn within, yet no one notices.
We part with our Lord on a long journey and burn like thee.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

===Seong Sam-mun===
Like Yi Gae, [[Seong Sam-mun]] (성삼문·1418–1456) was one of "six martyred ministers," and was the leader of the conspiracy to assassinate Sejo.  He refused the offer of pardon and denied Sejo's legitimacy.  He recited the following sijo in prison and the second one (five-syllable poem) on his way to the place of execution, where his limbs were tied to oxen and torn apart.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Cheon-tak, Cheong-gu-yeong-un, 1728&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

As the sound of drum calls for my life,
I turn my head where sun is about to set.
There is no inn on the way to underworld.

===Jo Gwang-jo===
[[Jo Gwang-jo]] (조광조·1482–1519) was a [[neo-Confucian]] reformer who was framed by the conservative faction opposing his reforms in the [[Korean Literati Purges|Third Literati Purge of 1519]].  His political enemies slandered Jo to be disloyal by writing "Jo will become the king" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王) with honey on leaves so that caterpillars left behind the same phrase as if in supernatural manifestation.  [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] ordered his death by sending poison and abandoned Jo's reform measures.  Jo, who had believed to the end that Jungjong would see his errors, wrote the following before drinking poison on December 20, 1519.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], December 16, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  Repetition of similar looking words is used to emphasize strong conviction in this five-syllable poem.

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;

[[Jeong Mong-ju]] (정몽주·1337–1392), considered "father" of Korean neo-Confucianism, was a high minister of [[Goryeo]] dynasty when Yi Seong-gye overthrew Goryeo and established [[Joseon]] dynasty.  He  answered with the following sijo to the future [[Taejong of Joseon]] when the latter demanded his support for the new dynasty with [[Jeong Mong-ju#Poem|a poem of his own]].  Just as he suspected, he was assassinated the same night on April 4, 1392.

{{quotation|&lt;poem&gt;
{{lang|ko|이몸이 죽고 죽어 일백 번 고쳐 죽어
백골이 진토되어 넋이라도 있고 없고
임 향한 일편 단심이야 가실 줄이 있으랴.}}

Should this body die and die again a hundred times over,
White bones turning to dust, with or without trace of soul,
My steadfast heart toward Lord, could it ever fade away?&lt;/poem&gt;}}

This article is about the [[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Senegal]], including [[population density]], [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

About 42% of [[Senegal]]'s population is rural. In rural areas, population density varies from about 77 per square kilometer (200/mile²) in the west-central region to 2 per square kilometer (5/mile²) in the arid eastern section. The average population density for the country is 68 people per square kilometer (169/sq mi).&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"/&gt; French is the official language but is used regularly only by the literate minority. Almost all Senegalese speak an indigenous language, of which [[Wolof language|Wolof]] has the largest usage. Many Senegalese  live in Europe, particularly in France, Italy and Spain.

==Population==
[[Image:Senegal population.svg|thumb|right|Demographics of Senegal, From UN estimates; Number of inhabitants in millions.]]
According to the 2018 revision of the World Population Review&lt;ref name="WPR 2018"&gt;{{cite |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/senegal-population/ |title=World Population Review: Senegal Population 2018|date=14 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the total population was 16,302,789 in May 2018, compared to only 2,416,000 in 1950. The proportion of children below the age of 15 in 2017 was 41.5%, between 15 and 54 years of age was 31.1%, while 55 years or older was 6.9%.

==Emigration==
Senegal aforetime was a destination country for neighboring economic migrants, but in recent decades West African migrants more often use Senegal as a transit point to North Africa and also to illegally onward to Europe.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt; The country also has been host to several thousand black Mauritanian refugees since they were expelled from Mauritania during the 1989 border conflict with Senegal. The country’s economic crisis in the 1970s stimulated emigration; departures accelerated from the 1990s. Destinations shifted from neighboring countries to [[Libya]] and [[Mauritania]], because of their booming oil industries, and to [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;

'''''From Russia with Love''''' is a 1963 British [[spy film]] and the second in the [[James Bond in film|''James Bond'' film series]] produced by [[Eon Productions]], as well as [[Sean Connery]]'s second role as [[MI6]] agent [[James Bond]]. It was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Johanna Harwood]], based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|similarly named 1957 novel]]. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet [[consulate]] clerk [[Tatiana Romanova]] in [[Turkey]], where [[SPECTRE]] plans to avenge Bond's killing of [[Julius No|Dr. No]].

Following the success of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and in [[Scotland]]. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date.

''From Russia with Love'' was a critical and commercial success. It took more than $78 million in worldwide box office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor ''Dr. No'', thereby becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in 1960s cinema.

This film also marked the debut of [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], a role he would play for 36 years until ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' in 1999.

==Plot==
Seeking to exact revenge on James Bond (007) for killing its agent [[Julius No|Dr. No]] and destroying the organisation's assets in the [[Caribbean]], the international criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] begins training agents to kill Bond. Their star pupil is Donald "Red" Grant, an Irish assassin who proves his mettle by killing a Bond impostor in one minute and fifty-two seconds on a training course with a garrote wire concealed in his wristwatch.

Meanwhile, the organisation's Chief Planner, a [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czech]] [[chess grandmaster]] named Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor [[cryptography|cryptographic]] device from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]]. SPECTRE's Chief Executive, [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|Number&amp;nbsp;1]], puts [[Rosa Klebb]] (Number 3), a former Colonel of [[SMERSH]] (the counter-intelligence branch of Soviet Intelligence) who has defected to SPECTRE in the West, in charge of the mission as Chief of Operations. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor and then to eliminate 007 and steal the cipher machine for SPECTRE. As part of the scheme, Klebb recruits the beautiful [[Tatiana Romanova]], a cipher clerk at the [[USSR|Soviet]] [[consulate]] in [[Istanbul]], who believes the ex-Colonel still to be working for SMERSH.

In [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] informs Bond that Romanova has contacted their "Station 'T'" in [[Turkey]], claiming to have fallen in love with Bond from his file photo. She offers to defect to the West, and will bring a top secret Lektor with her to sweeten the deal but only on the condition that Bond handle her case, personally. Prior to his departure, Bond is supplied by [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] with an [[attaché case]] containing a concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a special [[tear gas]] booby trap connected to the lock mechanism and ammunition for an [[Armalite AR-7]] folding sniper rifle with an infrared night scope.

After travelling to [[Istanbul]], Bond heads into the city to meet with station head [[List of James Bond allies in From Russia with Love#Ali Kerim Bey|Ali Kerim Bey]], tailed by [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate in order to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a [[limpet mine]], Kerim, however, is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress. He and Bond then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilenku is responsible for the bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural [[Romani people|gypsy]] settlement. However, Krilenku learns of this and promptly attacks a Gypsy feast, where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests, with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilenku down to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.

Upon returning to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova waiting for him in his bed and has sex with her; neither is aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a prearranged rendezvous at [[Hagia Sophia]] to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor and, together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the [[Orient Express]]. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.

At the railway station in [[Belgrade]], Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death to one of his sons, and asks for an agent from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Station Y]] to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant intercepts Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a [[murder-suicide]], to scandalise the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British intelligence community|intelligence community]]. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in brutal hand-to-hand combat. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own [[garrotte]]. Bond then drags the barely conscious Romanova from the train, which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice, where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.

Upon hearing the news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet to explain what went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance to make good on the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).

The next morning, Bond's stolen truck is intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking aircraft by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing the man to drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]] and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a [[Flare gun|Very flare]] to engulf all the chase boats in a sea of flames.

Eventually, he and Romanova reach a hotel in [[Venice]], where they believe themselves to be safe. Klebb, however, disguised as a maid, makes one final attempt on Bond and the Lektor. Klebb tries to kick him with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her with her own dropped gun. With the mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova leave Venice on a romantic boat ride, in which course Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.

==Production==
Following the financial success of ''Dr. No'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to [[Eon Productions]] with $2 million, and also approved a bonus for Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 along with his $54,000 salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=United Artists: the company that changed the film industry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EeK5s3aw44C&amp;pg=PA260|first=Tino|last=Balio|page=260|publisher=[[University of Wisconsin]] Press|year=1987|isbn=9780299230135}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[John F.

The film introduced several conventions which would become essential elements of the series: a [[pre-title sequence]], the Blofeld character (referred to in the film only as "Number 1"), a secret-weapon gadget for Bond, a helicopter sequence (repeated in every subsequent Bond film except ''[[The Man with the Golden Gun (film)|The Man with the Golden Gun]]''), a postscript action scene after the main climax, a theme song with lyrics, and the line "James Bond will return/be back" in the credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/film/james-bond-retrospective-from-russia-with-love-1963|title=James Bond Retrospective: From Russia With Love (1963)|publisher=Whatculture|accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
[[Ian Fleming]]'s novel was a [[Cold War]] thriller but the producers replaced the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] undercover agency [[SMERSH]] with the crime syndicate SPECTRE so as to avoid controversial political overtones.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt; The SPECTRE training grounds were inspired by the film ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]''.&lt;ref name="young"/&gt; The original screenwriter was [[Len Deighton]], who accompanied Harry Saltzman, Syd Cain, and Terence Young to Istanbul&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://hmssweblog.wordpress.com/2012/11/04/len-deighton-on-from-russia-with-love/ |title=Len Deighton on From Russia With Love &amp;#124; The Spy Command |publisher=Hmssweblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was replaced because of a lack of progress.&lt;ref name=maibaum&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=sWewbX79ISsC&amp;pg=PA284|title=Backstory: interviews with screenwriters of Hollywood's golden age|author=[[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|McGilligan, Patrick]]|page=284|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1986|isbn=978-0-520-05689-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, two of ''Dr. No''{{'}}s writers, [[Johanna Harwood]] and [[Richard Maibaum]], returned for the second film in the series&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt; Some sources state Harwood with being credited for "adaptation" mostly for her suggestions which were carried over into Maibaum's script.&lt;ref name=maibaum/&gt; Harwood stated in an interview in a ''Cinema Retro'' that she had been a screenwriter of several of Harry Saltzman's projects, and her screenplay for ''From Russia with Love'' had followed Fleming's novel closely, but she left the series due to what she called Terence Young's constant rewriting of her screenplay with ideas that were not in the original Fleming work.&lt;ref&gt;''Johanna Harwood Interview'' ''Movie Classics # 4'' Solo Publishing 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
Maibaum kept on making rewrites as filming progressed. Red Grant was added to the Istanbul scenes just prior to the film crew's trip to Turkey: this brought more focus to the SPECTRE plot, as Grant started saving Bond's life there (a late change during shooting involved Grant killing the bespectacled spy at Hagia Sophia instead of Bond, who ends up just finding the man dead).&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt; For the last quarter of the movie, Maibaum added two chase scenes, with a helicopter and speedboats, and changed the location of Bond and Klebb's battle from Paris to Venice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Chapman |first=James |year=2007 |title= Licence to Thrill |publisher= Cinema and Society |location= London/New York City |isbn=978-1-84511-515-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Although uncredited, the actor who played Number&amp;nbsp;1 was [[Anthony Dawson]], who had played Professor Dent in the previous Bond film, ''Dr. No'' and appeared in several of Terence Young's films. In the end credits, Blofeld is credited with a [[question mark]]. Blofeld's lines were redubbed by Viennese actor [[Eric Pohlmann]] in the final cut.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt; [[Peter Burton]] was unavailable to return as Major Boothroyd, so [[Desmond Llewelyn]], a Welsh actor who was a fan of the [[James Bond (comic strip)|Bond comic strip]] published in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', accepted the part. However, screen credit for Llewelyn was omitted at the opening of the film and is reserved for the exit credits, where he is credited simply as "Boothroyd". Llewelyn's character is not referred to by this name in dialogue, but M does introduce him as being from Q Branch. Llewelyn remained as the character, better known as Q, in all but one of the series' films until his death in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BikCz7XZijEC&amp;pg=PA83|title=The rough guide to James Bond|first=Paul|last=Simpson|page=83|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|year=2002|accessdate=25 March 2011|isbn=9781843531425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |title=Inside Q's Lab |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Home Entertainment Inc |location=''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' Ultimate Edition, Disk 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several actresses were considered for the role of Tatiana, including Italians [[Sylva Koscina]] and [[Virna Lisi]], Danish actress [[Annette Stroyberg|Annette Vadim]], and English-born [[Tania Mallet]].&lt;ref name="inside-frwl"&gt;{{Cite AV media |title=Inside From Russia with Love |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Metro Goldwyn Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Home Entertainment Inc |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miss Universe 1960|1960]] [[Miss Universe]] runner-up Daniela Bianchi was ultimately cast, supposedly Sean Connery's choice. Bianchi started taking English classes for the role, but the producers ultimately chose to have her lines redubbed by British stage actress [[Barbara Jefford]] in the final cut.&lt;ref name="commentary"&gt;''From Russia with Love'' [[audio commentary]], Ultimate Edition DVD&lt;/ref&gt; The scene in which Bond finds Tatiana in his hotel bed was used for Bianchi's [[screen test]], with Dawson standing in, this time, as Bond.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt; The scene later became the traditional screen test scene for prospective James Bond actors and Bond Girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |year=2000 | title = Inside Octopussy | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM Home Entertainment Inc. |accessdate =4 August 2007 | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322765/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |year=2000 |title= Inside The Living Daylights |medium= DVD | publisher= MGM Home Entertainment Inc. |accessdate =4 August 2007 | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307015/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek actress [[Katina Paxinou]] was originally considered for the role of Rosa Klebb, but was unavailable. Terence Young cast Austrian singer Lotte Lenya after hearing one of her musical recordings. Young wanted Kronsteen's portrayer to be "an actor with a remarkable face", so the minor character would be well remembered by audiences. This led to the casting of [[Vladek Sheybal]], whom Young also considered convincing as an intellectual.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{Cite AV media |author=[[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]] |title=From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]] |location=''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1 |publisher= MGM Home Entertainment |id= Accessed 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several women were tested for the roles of Vida and Zora, the two fighting Gypsy girls, and after [[Aliza Gur]] and [[Martine Beswick]] were cast, they spent six weeks practising their fight choreography with stunt work arranger Peter Perkins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |author=[[Aliza Gur]] |title= From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]] |location= ''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1 |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment |id= Accessed 20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beswick was mis-credited as 'Martin Beswick' in the films opening titles, but this error was fixed for the 2001 DVD release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.007museum.com/from_russia_with_love.htm|title=From Russia with Love|website=www.007museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican actor [[Pedro Armendáriz]] was recommended to Young by director [[John Ford]] to play Kerim Bey. After experiencing increasing discomfort on location in Istanbul, Armendáriz was diagnosed with inoperable cancer. Filming in Istanbul was terminated, the production moved to Britain, and Armendáriz's scenes were brought forward so that he could complete his scenes without delay. Though visibly in pain, he continued working as long as possible. When he could no longer work, he returned home and took his own life.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL" /&gt; Remaining shots after Armendáriz left London had a [[stunt double]] and Terence Young himself as stand-ins.&lt;ref name="booklet" /&gt;

Englishman [[Joe Robinson (actor)|Joe Robinson]] was a strong contender for the role of [[Red Grant]] but it was given to Robert Shaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thevisitor.co.uk/news/morecambe-and-district-news/joe_has_eye_of_the_tiger_1_1217122|title=Joe has eye of the Tiger |date=10 August 2004 |work= [[The Visitor (Morecambe newspaper)|The Visitor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
{{See also|List of James Bond vehicles|List of James Bond gadgets|James Bond locations}}
Most of the film was set in Istanbul, Turkey. Locations included the [[Basilica Cistern]], Hagia Sophia and the [[İstanbul Sirkeci Terminal|Sirkeci railway station]], which also was used for the [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]] railway stations. The MI6 office in London, SPECTRE Island, the Venice hotel and the interior scenes of the Orient Express were filmed at [[Pinewood Studios]] with some footage of the train. In the film, the train journey was set in [[Eastern Europe]]. The journey and the truck ride were shot in [[Argyll]], Scotland and [[Switzerland]]. The end scenes for the film were shot in [[Venice]].&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"&gt;{{Cite AV media |year=2000 |title= Inside From Russia with Love |medium = DVD |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment Inc. |people = Martine Beswick, Daniela Bianchi, Dana Broccoli, Syd Cain, Sean Connery, Peter Hunt, John Stears, Norman Wanstall |accessdate =4 August 2007 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322760/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, to qualify for the British film funding of the time, at least 70 percent of the film had to have been filmed in Great Britain or the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Barnes |first1=Alan |last2=Hearn |first2=Marcu |year=1997 |title=Kiss Kiss Bang!

Director Terence Young's eye for realism was evident throughout production. For the opening chess match, Kronsteen wins the game with a reenactment of [[Boris Spassky]]'s victory over [[David Bronstein]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=1882|title=The name is Spassky – Boris Spassky |publisher= ChessBase.com |date=2 September 2004 |accessdate=16 February 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121007073815/http://www.chessbase.com/newsprint.asp?newsid=1882 |archivedate=7 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production Designer Syd Cain built up the "chess pawn" motif in his $150,000 set for the brief sequence.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; Cain also later added a promotion to another movie Eon was producing, making Kirilenko's death happen inside a billboard for ''[[Call Me Bwana]]''.&lt;ref name=hero/&gt; A noteworthy gadget featured was the [[attaché case]] (briefcase) issued by Q Branch. It had a tear gas bomb that detonated if the case was improperly opened, a folding [[AR-7]] [[sniper rifle]] with twenty rounds of ammunition, a throwing knife, and 50 [[Sovereign (British coin)|gold sovereigns]]. A boxer at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Young choreographed the fight between Grant and Bond along with stunt coordinator Peter Perkins. The scene took three weeks to film and was violent enough to worry some on the production. Robert Shaw and Connery did most of the stunts themselves.&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt;

After the unexpected loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by [[Berkely Mather]] during filming. Editor [[Peter R. Hunt|Peter Hunt]] set about editing the film while key elements were still to be filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young came up with the idea of moving the Red Grant training sequence to the beginning of the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to refilm Lotte Lenya's lines.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt;

Behind schedule and over-budget, the production crew struggled to complete production in time for the already-announced premiere date that October. On 6 July 1963, while scouting locations in Argyll, Scotland for that day's filming of the climactic boat chase, Terence Young's helicopter crashed into the water with art director Michael White and a cameraman aboard. The craft sank into 40–50 feet (12–15&amp;nbsp;m) of water&lt;!-- John Stears --&gt;, but all escaped with minor injuries. Despite the calamity, Young was behind the camera for the full day's work. A few days later, Bianchi's driver fell asleep during the commute to a 6&amp;nbsp;am shoot and crashed the car. The actress's face was bruised and Bianchi's scenes had to be delayed for two weeks while the facial contusions healed.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt;

The helicopter and boat chase scenes were not in the original novel but were added to create an action climax. The former was inspired by the crop-dusting scene in [[Alfred Hitchcock|Hitchcock's]] ''[[North by Northwest]]'' and the latter by a previous Young/Broccoli/Maibaum collaboration, ''[[The Red Beret]]''.&lt;ref name="cork" /&gt; These two scenes would initially be shot in Istanbul but were moved to Scotland. The speedboats could not go fast enough due to the many waves in the sea,&lt;ref name="gotell"/&gt; and a rented boat filled with cameras ended up sinking in the Bosphorus.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; A helicopter was also hard to obtain, and the special effects crew were nearly arrested trying to get one at a local airbase.&lt;ref name="gotell"&gt;{{Cite AV media |author=[[Walter Gotell]] |title=From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]]|location=''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1|publisher = MGM Home Entertainment |id= Accessed 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |author=[[John Stears]] |title=From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]] |location= ''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1 |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment |id= Accessed 17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The helicopter chase was filmed with a [[radio control]]led miniature helicopter.&lt;ref name="commentary"/&gt; The sounds of the boat chase were replaced in post-production since the boats were not loud enough,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media |author=Norman Wanstall |title= From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]] |location= ''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1 |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment |id= Accessed 20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the explosion, shot in Pinewood, got out of control, burning [[Walter Gotell]]'s eyelids&lt;ref name="gotell" /&gt; and seriously injuring three stuntmen.&lt;ref name="cork"&gt;{{Cite AV media |author=John Cork |title= From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]] |location= ''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1 |publisher = MGM Home Entertainment |id= Accessed 20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographer [[David Hurn]] was commissioned by the producers of the [[James Bond]] films to shoot a series of stills with [[Sean Connery]] and the actresses of the film. When the [[theatrical property]] [[Walther PPK]] pistol did not arrive, Hurn volunteered the use of his own Walther LP-53 [[air pistol]].&lt;ref&gt;"http://christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=1992033&lt;/ref&gt; Though the photographs of the "James Bond is Back" posters of the US release airbrushed out the long barrel of the pistol, [[film poster]] artist Renato Fratini used the long-barrelled pistol for his drawings of Connery on the British posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bfi.org.uk/filmtvinfo/library/eventsexh/past/2007_01_10_bond.html|title=Poster Galore |publisher= [[British Film Institute]]|date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309163839/http://www.bfi.org.uk/filmtvinfo/library/eventsexh/past/2007_01_10_bond.html |archivedate=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monro's vocal version is later played during the film (as source music on a radio) and properly over the film's end titles.&lt;ref name="James Bond Theme" /&gt; Barry travelled with the crew to Turkey to try getting influences of the local music, but ended up using almost nothing, just local instruments such as [[Zill|finger cymbals]] to give an exotic feeling, since he thought the Turkish music had a comedic tone that did not fit in the "dramatic feeling" of the James Bond movies.&lt;ref name="barry"&gt;{{Cite AV media|author=[[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]]|title=From Russia with Love [[audio commentary]]|location=''From Russia with Love'' Ultimate Edition, Disc 1|publisher = MGM Home Entertainment|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Recalling his visit to Istanbul, John Barry said, "It was like no place I'd ever been in my life. [The Trip] was supposedly to seep up the music, so Noel Rogers and I used to go 'round to these nightclubs and listen to all this stuff. We had the strangest week, and really came away with nothing, except a lot of ridiculous stories. We went back, talked to Lionel, and then he wrote 'From Russia with Love.&lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Music_of_James_Bond.html?id=wQE2RmHrErcC|title=The Music of James Bond|last=Burlingame|first=Jon|date=2012-11-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199986767|location=|pages=25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this film, Barry introduced the percussive theme "[[007 Theme|007]]"—action music that came to be considered the "secondary James Bond theme". He composed it to have a lighter, enthusiastic and more adventurous theme to relax the audience.&lt;ref name="barry"/&gt; The arrangement appears twice on the soundtrack album; the second version, entitled "007 Takes the Lektor", is the one used during the gunfight at the Gypsy camp and also during Bond's theft of the Lektor decoding machine.&lt;ref name="insideFRWL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="music"&gt;{{Cite AV media |year=2000 | title = The Music of James Bond | medium = DVD | publisher = MGM Home Entertainment Inc. |accessdate =4 August 2007 | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307198/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The completed film features a holdover from the Monty Norman-supervised ''Dr. No'' music; the post-rocket-launch music from ''Dr. No'' is played in ''From Russia with Love'' during the helicopter and speedboat attacks.&lt;ref name="music"/&gt;

==Release and reception==
''From Russia with Love'' premiered on 10 October 1963 at the [[Odeon Leicester Square]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Premium for Bond-Lovers:"From Russia with Love"|newspaper=[[The Illustrated London News]]|date=5 October 1963|location=London|page=527}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Fleming, Sean Connery and Walter Gotell attended the premiere.

The film was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]] for "[[From Russia with Love (soundtrack)|From Russia with Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057076/awards|title=Awards won by From Russia with Love|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reviews===
In comparing the film to its predecessor, ''Dr. No'', [[Richard Roud]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', said that ''From Russia with Love'' "didn't seem quite so lively, quite so fresh, or quite so rhythmically fast-moving."&lt;ref name="Roud (1963)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Roud|first=Richard|title=New Films|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=11 October 1963|authorlink=Richard Roud|location=London|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that "...&amp;nbsp;the film is highly immoral in every imaginable way; it is neither uplifting, instructive nor life-enhancing. Neither is it great film-making. But it sure is fun."&lt;ref name="Roud (1963)"/&gt; Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Penelope Gilliatt]] noted that "The way the credits are done has the same self-mocking flamboyance as everything else in the picture."&lt;ref name="Gilliatt (1963)"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilliatt|first=Penelope|title=Laughing it off with Bond: Films|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=13 October 1963|authorlink=Penelope Gilliatt|location=London|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilliatt went on to say that the film manages "to keep up its own cracking pace, nearly all the way. The set-pieces are a stunning box of tricks".&lt;ref name="Gilliatt (1963)"/&gt; The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' wrote of Bond that he is "the secret ideal of the congenital square, conventional in every particular&amp;nbsp;... except in morality, where he has the courage—and the physical equipment—to do without thinking what most of us feel we might be doing&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name="Times (1963)"&gt;{{cite news|title=Four Just Men Rolled into One|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=10 October 1963|location=London|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critic thought that overall, "the nonsense is all very amiable and tongue-in-cheek and will no doubt make a fortune for its devisers".&lt;ref name="Times (1963)"/&gt;

[[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said: "Don't miss it! This is to say, don't miss it if you can still get the least bit of fun out of lurid adventure fiction and pseudo-realistic fantasy. For this mad melodramatization of a desperate adventure of Bond with sinister characters in Istanbul and on the Orient Express is fictional exaggeration on a grand scale and in a dashing style, thoroughly illogical and improbable, but with tongue blithely wedged in cheek."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E05EEDA1330E033A2575AC0A9629C946591D6CF | title = James Bond Travels the Orient Express | date = 9 April 1964 | accessdate=11 May 2009| author=Bosley Crowther| authorlink=Bosley Crowther|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine called the film "fast, smart, shrewdly directed and capably performed"&lt;ref name="Time (1964)"&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,875772,00.html | title= Once More Unto the Breach | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=10 April 1964 | accessdate=11 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented extensively on the film's humour, saying "Director Young is a master of the form he ridicules, and in almost every episode he hands the audience shocks as well as yocks. But the yocks are more memorable. They result from slight but sly infractions of the thriller formula. A Russian agent, for instance, does not simply escape through a window; no, he escapes through a window in a brick wall painted with a colossal poster portrait of [[Anita Ekberg]], and as he crawls out of the window, he seems to be crawling out of Anita's mouth. Or again, Bond does not simply train a telescope on the Russian consulate and hope he can read somebody's lips; no, he makes his way laboriously into a gallery beneath the joint, runs a submarine periscope up through the walls, and there, at close range, inspects two important Soviet secrets: the heroine's legs."&lt;ref name="Time (1964)"/&gt;

===Reflective reviews=== &lt;!-- do not rename this section without fixing the intro's forward reference --&gt;
''From Russia with Love'' received generally positive reviews from critics; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] sampled 49 reviewers and judged 96% of the reviews to be positive with a rating of 8/10. Its summary states: " The second James Bond film, ''From Russia with Love'' is a razor-sharp, briskly-paced Cold War thriller that features several electrifying action scenes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From Russia With Love (1963)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/from_russia_with_love/|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=22 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many online sites also commonly state ''From Russia with Love'' as the best Bond film of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commanderbond.net/2750/cbn-reviews-from-russia-with-love.html|title=CBn Reviews 'From Russia With Love'|last=Zydel|first=Devin|publisher=CBn|accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1986 book, [[Danny Peary]] described ''From Russia with Love'' as "an excellent, surprisingly tough and gritty James Bond film" which is "refreshingly free of the gimmickry that would characterise the later Bond films, and Connery and Bianchi play ''real'' people. We worry about them and hope their relationship will work out&amp;nbsp;... Shaw and Lotte Lenya are splendid villains. Both have exciting, well-choreographed fights with Connery. Actors play it straight, with excellent results."&lt;ref&gt;Danny Peary, ''Guide for the Film Fanatic'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986) p.163&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[James Berardinelli]] cited this as his favourite Bond film, writing "Only ''From Russia with Love'' avoids slipping into the comic book realm of ''Goldfinger'' and its successors while giving us a sampling of the familiar Bond formula (action, gadgets, women, cars, etc.). ''From Russia with Love'' is effectively paced and plotted, features a gallery of detestable rogues (including the ultimate Bond villain, Blofeld), and offers countless thrills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/top100/103.html|title=Top 100 Runner Up: From Russia with Love|publisher=Reelviews|author=Berardinelli, James|accessdate=16 March 2008|authorlink=James Berardinelli}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001 Neil Smith of ''[[BBC]] Films'' called it "a film that only gets better with age".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=From Russia with Love (1963)| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/06/19/from_russia_with_love_1963_review.shtml|publisher=BBC| date=19 June 2001 | accessdate=16 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, ''[[Total Film]]'' magazine named it the ninth-greatest British film of all time, making it the only James Bond film to appear on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3711460.stm |title=Get Carter tops British film poll |accessdate=28 July 2007 |date=3 October 2004 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Jay Antani of Filmcritic praised the film's "impressive staging of action scenes",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/misc/emporium.nsf/reviews/From-Russia-with-Love|title=From Russia with Love|last=Antani|first=Jay|publisher=Filmcritic.com|accessdate=16 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102052/http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1963/from-russia-with-love/|archivedate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[IGN]] listed it as second-best Bond film ever, behind only ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/746/746573p4.html|title=James Bond's Top 20|publisher=IGN|date=17 November 2006|accessdate=4 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' put the film at ninth among Bond films, criticising the slow pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1560072_14,00.html|title=Ranking the Bond Films|author=Benjamin Svetkey, Joshua Rich|date=15 November 2006|accessdate=16 March 2008|work=Entertainment Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the "James Bond Ultimate Collector's Set" was released in November 2007 by MGM, Norman Wilner of [[MSN]] chose ''From Russia with Love'' as the best Bond film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.sympatico.msn.ca/features/ArticleNormanWilner.aspx?cp-documentid=436189|title=Rating the Spy Game|publisher=[[MSN]]|author=Norman Wilner|accessdate=4 March 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119210839/http://movies.sympatico.msn.ca/features/ArticleNormanWilner.aspx?cp-documentid=436189|archivedate=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, in his book about the Bond phenomenon, ''The Man With the Golden Touch,'' British author Sinclair McKay states "I know it is heresy to say so, and that some enthusiasts regard ''From Russia With Love'' as the Holy Grail of Bond, but let's be searingly honest – some of it is crashingly dull."&lt;ref&gt;McKay, Sinclair. ''The Man With the Golden Touch.'' Overlook Press: New York. 2008. Pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2014 ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/best-action-movies|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|title=The 100 best action movies|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''From Russia With Love'' was listed at 69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-70-61?package_page%3D23379 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312133940/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/film/the-100-best-action-movies-70-61?package_page=23379 |archivedate=12 March 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British Film Institute]]'s [[screenonline]] guide called the film "one of the series' high points" and said it "had advantages not enjoyed by many later Bond films, notably an intelligent script that retained the substance of [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|Ian Fleming's novel]] while toning down the overt Cold War politics (the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] had only occurred the previous year)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/520462/ |title=From Russia With Love (1963) |author=Michael Brooke |work=[[screenonline]] |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=11 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6gse0OdyO?url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/520462/ |archivedate=19 April 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Michael G. Wilson]], the current co-producer of the series, stated "We always start out trying to make another ''From Russia with Love'' and end up with another ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/entertainment/movie/from-russia-with-love.html|title=From Russia With Love|last=Nusair|first=David|publisher=AskMen|date=1 November 2008| accessdate=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Connery,&lt;ref name="booklet"/&gt; Michael G.

It is snowing, and a factory is on the background. On the bottom corners icons indicating ammo and health of the player can be seen.]]
In 2005, the ''[[007: From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]'' video game was developed by [[Electronic Arts]] and released on 1 November 2005 in North America. It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented. One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation [[SPECTRE]] to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] over the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' between United Artists/MGM and writer [[Kevin McClory]]. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. Featuring a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[Deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the [[Aston Martin DB5]] from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and the rocketbelt from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/james-bond-007-from-russia-with-love/654415p1.html|title=Interview with David Carson|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=29 September 2005|accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/fromrussiawithlove/review.html|title=From Russia With Love Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 November 2005|accessdate=8 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041325/http://www.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/reviews/from-russia-with-love-review-6137026/|archivedate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was penned by [[Bruce Feirstein]], who had previously worked on the film scripts for ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', and the 2004 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]''. Its soundtrack was composed by [[Christopher Lennertz]] and [[Vic Flick]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video game|title = [[From Russia with Love (video game)|From Russia with Love]]|developer = [[Electronic Arts]]| date =1 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crime was committed by a group of persons belonging to a [[gang]] calling themselves ''les barbares'' (The Barbarians). Many of them have criminal records and have been imprisoned.

During the investigation it appeared that key members of the group were probably implicated in at least 15 other cases of kidnapping or racketeering.&lt;ref name = "LF2"&gt;{{Cite news| url         = http://www.urgenceserrurierparis.fr| title       = La police cherche encore des membres du gang  | accessdate  = 2008-12-30| date        = February 27, 2006| newspaper   = [[Le Figaro]]| language    = fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posing as members of the [[National Front for the Liberation of Corsica]] or members of the French division of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine|PFLP]], they threatened several high-ranking [[CEO]]s including Jérôme Clément, president of the European TV operator [[Arte]], [[Rony Brauman]], former president and co-founder of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]], and the CEO as well as another high-ranking member of a large company selling [[home appliance]]s. They sent threatening pictures of an unknown man dressed as a middle-eastern Arab in front of a picture of [[Osama Bin Laden]]. In another case, the owner of a large [[grocery store]] was directed to pay 100,000 euros.

In total, 27 individuals were under investigation and were subsequently put on trial. Among these:

* ''Youssouf Fofana'' (August 2, 1980), the self-proclaimed ''Brain of the Barbarians''. He was born in [[Paris]] to immigrants from [[Côte d'Ivoire]] and served time in prison for various crimes including [[armed robbery]], [[car theft]] and [[resisting arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steven Erlanger |date=July 11, 2009 |title=Man Sentenced to Life in Killing of Jew in France |newspaper=The New York Times |page=A8 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/11/world/europe/11france.html |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview he denied killing Halimi, but showed no remorse for his actions.&lt;ref name = "LF"&gt;{{Cite news

===Similar assault===
{{Importance section|date=February 2014}}
On February 22, 2008, six members of a group calling themselves ''Barbarians'' assaulted 19-year-old Mathieu Roumi in the same Paris suburb of [[Bagneux, Hauts-de-Seine|Bagneux]] where Halimi was kidnapped. For two hours the attackers tortured the young man. One shoved cigarette butts into his mouth, another took issue with Roumi's Jewish origin (paternal), grabbed correction fluid and scrawled ''sale juif'' ("dirty Jew") and ''sale PD'' ("dirty faggot") on his forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=March 6, 2008 |url=http://www.rmc.fr/editorial/35560/la-victime-ange-ou-demon/ |title=La victime, ange ou démon? |language=fr |trans-title=The victim, angel or demon? |publisher=BMFTV |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the issue of his sexual orientation arose, one of them placed a condom on the tip of a stick and shoved it in Roumi's mouth. The six men proceeded to scream at him and threaten that he would die the way Halimi did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jewish teen tortured in French town where Ilan Halimi was killed |author=Daniel Ben Simon |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The men were all arrested.

== Kidnapping and investigation ==
The kidnapping seems to be motivated by a combination of [[antisemitism]] and a desire for money. Although the torture was largely directed at his genitals, there was no evidence of sexual assault or a sexual motive.

===Ransom===

The kidnappers originally thought Halimi was wealthy because he came from a Moroccan Jewish family, though he came from the same poor and working-class neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris as the kidnappers did.&lt;ref name = "NYT1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1004804.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3515340,00.html Philippe Ovadia, the head of the Jewish community living in the very same lower-class area as the place where Halimi was held captive.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to then Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], members of the gang confessed that they believed all Jews to be rich and it motivated them to target several Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,13509-2054882,00.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=Paris kidnap gang suspect arrested in Ivory Coast | first1=Philippe | last1=Naughton | date=February 23, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kidnappers demanded ransom, initially EUR 450,000, eventually decreasing to EUR 5,000. It has been claimed that the family of Halimi was told that if they could not raise the money, they should get it from the Jewish community.

In order to convince Halimi's parents their son had been kidnapped, the abductors sent a picture of the young man being threatened by a gun and holding a newspaper to prove the date and time.&lt;ref name="nysun.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/foreign/tale-of-torture-and-murder-horrifies-the-whole/27948/ |title=Tale of Torture and Murder Horrifies the Whole of France |author=Michel Gurfinkiel |authorlink=Michel Gurfinkiel |newspaper=[[The New York Sun]] |date=February 22, 2006 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Police investigation===

The French police were heavily criticized because they initially believed that antisemitism was not a factor in the crime.&lt;ref name = "NYT1"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
Police have attributed to the banlieues' gang subculture a "poisonous mentality that designates Jews as enemies along with other 'outsiders,'" such as [[United States|Americans]], mainstream French, and [[Europe]]ans in general. "If they could have gotten their hands on a (non-Jewish) French cop in the same way, they probably would have done the same thing," a retired police chief opined.&lt;ref name = "LAT"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; This may have hampered the original investigation. Antisemitism is an [[aggravating circumstance]] (''circonstance aggravante'') in a murder case in France.

Ruth Halimi, Ilan's mother, subsequently co-authored a book with Émilie Frèche titled ''24 jours: la vérité sur la mort d'Ilan Halimi'', released April 2009. In the book, Ruth claimed that French police never suspected her son's kidnappers would kill the 23-year-old after three weeks in captivity in 2006, partly because they would not face the antisemitic character of the crime (as reported in the French daily [[Le Figaro]]). Émilie Frèche stated that "by denying the anti-semitic character,&amp;nbsp;... [the police] did not figure out the profile of the gang." The book details how Ilan's parents were told to stay silent during the ordeal and were ordered not to seek aid in order to pay the ransom, nor show their son's photo to people who might have come forward with information about his whereabouts.&lt;ref name=blamespolice&gt;{{cite news |author=Devorah Lauter |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/04/02/1004194/murdered-teens-mother-blames-police |title=Murdered man's mother blames police |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] (JTA) |date=April 2, 2009 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Elle (magazine)|''Elle'' Magazine]] on March 27, 2009, Ruth Halimi stated that "The police were completely off the mark. They thought they were dealing with classic bandits, but these people were beyond the norm." Halimi stated that she wrote the book to "alert public opinion to the danger of anti-semitism which has returned in other forms, so that a story like this can never happen again".&lt;ref name=blamespolice/&gt;

== Public interest and reaction ==

The case was widely reported on both in and outside France.

Six French associations called for a mass demonstration against racism and antisemitism in Paris on Sunday, February 26. Between 33,000 (as estimated by police) and 80,000 to 200,000 (as estimated by the organizers) people participated in Paris, as well as thousands around the country. Present were public figures such as [[Philippe Douste-Blazy]], [[François Hollande]], [[Lionel Jospin]] and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]. Also among the participants were [[Dalil Boubakeur]], head of the Paris Mosque and Chairman of the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Council of Muslims in France]], and [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurojewcong.org/france/370-march-in-paris-in-memory-of-slain-jewish-youth.html|title=March in Paris in Memory of Slain Jewish Youth on the EJC website|publisher=|accessdate=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Right-wing politician [[Philippe de Villiers]] was booed by far-left militants and had to leave under police guard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/infojour/reuters.asp?id=15467&amp;2138 L'Express&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001031703/http://www.lexpress.fr/info/infojour/reuters.asp?id=15467&amp;2138 |date=October 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9, the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|United States Helsinki Commission]] held a briefing titled "Tools for Combatting Anti-Semitism: Police Training and Holocaust Education" chaired by Commission Co-Chairman [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] (a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|representative]]) who said: "[Halimi's] tragedy made brutally clear that Jews are still attacked because they are Jews, and that our work to eradicate all forms of anti-Semitism in all its ugly forms and manifestations is far from done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/-osce-critical-point-fight-against-anti-semitism-helsinki-/2006/05/12/1648075.htm |title=OSCE at 'Critical Point' in Fight Against Anti-Semitism; Helsinki Commission Briefing Details Initiatives to Combat Intolerance |date=May 12, 2006 |agency=Comtex Global News |publisher=SIP Trunking Report |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2009 trial ==

The trial, which started on April 29, 2009, was conducted behind closed doors because two of the suspects were minors.&lt;ref&gt;Articles 14 and 20 {{cite web |url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006069158&amp;dateTexte=20081212 |title=Ordonnance n° 45-174 du 2 février 1945 relative à l'enfance délinquante |language=fr |trans-title=Ordinance No. 45-174 of 2 February 1945 on juvenile delinquency |date=July 12, 2014 |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It's the law of silence that killed her son, it would be unbearable for the trial to remain silent.''

The trial took 10 weeks.

===Incidents during and around the trial===
* A number of videos with Fonfana appeared on YouTube.
* Fofana appeared in court wearing a white [[T-shirt]], smiling, pointing to heaven and saying ''[[Takbir|Allāhu Akbar]]''. He claimed he had nothing to say and would be silent to the grave. When asked his name and date of birth he answered: ''Je m'appelle arabe, africaine révolte armée barbare salafiste. Je suis né le 13 février 2006 à Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois''. (''My name is [[Arab people|arab]], armed [[africa]]n rebellion [[Salafism|salafist]] barbarian army'' and ''I was born on February 13, 2006 in Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois'': the date and place Ilan Halimi was found).
* Fofana threw a shoe at the empty benches and again when he was taken down, shouting ''All the Jews in the world are there [in the empty box], they are my enemies. This is an Arab attack with a booby-trapped shoe!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Fofana expulsé de son procès après un lancer de chaussures |language=fr |trans-title=Fofana expelled from his trial after a shoe throwing |author=Flore Galaud |agency=AFP |date=June 11, 2009 |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/06/11/01016-20090611ARTFIG00541-fofana-expulse-de-son-proces-apres-un-lancer-de-chaussures-.php |newspaper=[[Le Figaro]] |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fofana claimed in court that he had friends who would "take pictures to identify people." Francis Szpiner, lawyer for the Halimi family, believed that Fofana was alluding to the jurors, and was implying that he was going to put a price on their heads.&lt;ref name = "FOXNews-043009"&gt;{{cite news

A number of others, whose implication was not direct, or related to other activities of the gang, received smaller sentences. Three persons were acquitted. Notable is that one person, for whom originally no sentence was asked, received a suspended sentence.

===After the trial===

Sorour Arbabzadeh, the then-17-year-old French-Iranian girl who acted as bait to trap Halimi, was sentenced to 9 years imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/0101579160-peine-maximale-pour-le-cerveau-du-gang-des-barbares |title=Peine maximale pour le cerveau du "gang des barbares" |language=fr |trans-title=Maximum penalty for the brains of "gang of barbarians"

The sentences issued after the first trial were criticized as too lenient by some parties, while others such as the [[Advocate General#Other European jurisdictions|attorney general]] [[Philippe Bilger]] found the sentences "exemplary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Affaire Halimi: un verdict qui ne passe pas |language=fr |trans-title=Halimi Case: A verdict that does not pass [i.e. fails] |author=Jérôme Bouin |newspaper=[[Le Figaro]] |agency=Associated Press and AFP |date=July 12, 2009 |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2009/07/12/01016-20090712ARTFIG00041-affaire-halimi-un-verdict-qui-ne-passe-pas-.php |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Justice (France)|Minister of Justice]] [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]], demanded an appeal of 8 of the 17 heaviest verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title="Gang des barbares": peines alourdies requises en appel |language=fr |trans-title="Gang of Barbarians" burdened penalties required appeal |date=December 9, 2010 | url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/peines-alourdies-requises-en-appel-contre-le-gang-des-barbares-09-12-2010-1184608.php |newspaper=Le Parisien |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Prasquier, president of [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], France's main Jewish organization, said that a law may soon be available that would preclude closed-door trials in this type of case.&lt;ref name=Kline-709&gt;{{cite news |date=July 16, 2009 |title=Trials and Tribulations |author=Brett Kline |newspaper=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |url=http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Trials-and-tribulations |accessdate=July 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Perhaps in a year's time there will be a new trial, and perhaps it will be public."

A Halimi relative said: "The important thing for me is not handing out heavier jail terms, honestly. The important thing is to open this to the press and public and make it a learning experience."

The retrial was officially announced Monday July 10, 2009. It started on October 25, 2010, and ended on December 17, 2010, with all convictions upheld and time added to some sentences.&lt;ref name="fcuikofj20101217"&gt;{{cite news

It is closely related to [[Naro language|Naro]], and includes the well-known dialect [[Gǀwi dialect|Gǀwi]], which has the majority of speakers.

The double pipe at the beginning of the name "Gǁana" represents a click like the English interjection used when saying ''giddy-ap'' to a horse. For the clicks and other sounds found in Gǁana, see [[Gǀwi dialect]].

'''''Haole''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|aʊ|l|iː}}; Hawaiian {{IPA-haw|ˈhɔule|}})&lt;ref name="Definition of Haole by Merriam-Webster 2018"&gt;{{cite web | title=Definition of HAOLE | website=Definition of Haole by Merriam-Webster | date=2018-10-29 | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/haole | access-date=2018-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term used in [[Hawaii]] to refer to individuals who are not descendants of the ethnic [[native Hawaiians]] or other [[Polynesians]]. The term "haole" is mostly used to refer to [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] ([[white people]]). In the [[Hawaiian language]], the term has been used historically and currently to refer to any foreigner or anything else introduced to the Hawaiian islands of foreign origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |haole |accessdate= November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the word predate the 1778 arrival of Captain [[James Cook]], as recorded in several chants stemming from antiquity. Its use historically has ranged from merely descriptive to invective, while today it is considered to be mildly pejorative.

==History==
Haole first became associated with the children of European immigrants in the early 1820s. It unified the self-identity of these Hawaii-born children whose parents were as much culturally different as they were similar.&lt;ref&gt;KE KUMU HAWAII 12 Nowemapa (1834) an article printed in a missionary newspaper describing a recital by haole children in November 1834, with Hawaiian royalty, the American Consulate, ship captains, other notable persons of Oahu, and many missionaries in attendance.&lt;/ref&gt; With the first three generations of Haole playing key roles in the rise of the economic and political power shifts that have lasted through the current day,&lt;ref&gt;HOME RULE REPUBALIKA 6 Nowemapa 1901 [http://nupepa.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/nupepa?e=d-0nupepa--00-0-0--010---4----text---0-1l--1haw-Zz-1---20-about---00031-0000utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;cl=CL1.4.1&amp;d=HASH04aa89f6c6d68b22c8fd0b.4 p.4]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haole'' evolved into a term that was often used in contempt especially after the missionaries imposed strict rules prohibiting games, singing, and playing. It evolved further to racial meaning, replacing "malihini" (newcomer)&lt;ref&gt;{{Hawaiian Dictionaries |malihini |accessdate= November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in addressing people of Caucasian descent who move to Hawaii from the U.S. mainland by the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= [[Mark Twain]] |title= Letters from Hawaii |editor= [[A. Grove Day]] |year= 1966 |origyear= 1866 |pages=202–203 |isbn= 978-0-8248-0288-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1906 phrase book sometimes translates it to "English (language)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= John Harris Soper |title= Hawaiian Phrase Book: No Huaolelo a Me Na Olelo Kikeki Na Ka Olelo Beritania a Me Ka Olelo Hawaii |year= 1906 |publisher= The Hawaiian news company |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tAxBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64 |page=64 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The 1865 ''Dictionary of the Hawaiian Language,'' compiled by Lorrin Andrews, shows the pronunciation as ha-o-le. A popular belief is that the word is properly written and pronounced as ''hā{{okina}}ole'', literally meaning "no breath," because foreigners did not know or use the ''honi'' (''[[hongi]]'' in [[Māori culture|Māori]]), a [[Polynesia]]n greeting by touching nose to nose and inhaling or essentially sharing each other's breaths, and so the foreigners were described as ''breathless''.  The implication is not only that foreigners are aloof and ignorant of local ways, but also literally have no spirit or life within.&lt;ref name="Kenn"&gt;{{Cite news|title= What is a Haole? |first=Charles W. |last=Kenn |work=Paradise of the Pacific |date=August 1944 |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Chad Piianaia, a Hawaiian educated in England, said the word haole implies thief or robber (from ''hao'', thief, and ''le'', lazy).&lt;ref name="Kenn" /&gt; In 1944 Hawaiian scholar Charles Kenn wrote, "In the primary and esoteric meaning, haole indicates a race that has no relation to one's own; an outsider, one who does not conform to the mores of the group; one that is void of the life element because of inattention to natural laws which make for the goodness in man. In its secondary meaning, haole ... implies a thief, a robber, one not to be trusted.... During the course of time, meanings of words change, and today, in a very general way, haole does not necessarily connote a negative thought.... The word has come to refer to one of Nordic descent, whether born in Hawaii or elsewhere."&lt;ref name="Kenn" /&gt;

[[File:Frederick William Kahapula Beckley (1874–1943).jpg|thumb|upright|Professor [[Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Jr.|Fred Beckley]]]]

Native Hawaiian Professor [[Frederick William Kahapula Beckley Jr.|Fred Beckley]] said, "The white people came to be known as ha-ole (without breath) because after they said their prayers, they did not breathe three times as was customary in ancient Hawaii."&lt;ref name="Kenn" /&gt;

New findings have proven all of these theories to be incorrect. The earliest use of the word "haole" in the Hawaiian language was in the chant of Kūaliʻi; in which a pre-European voyager from the island of Oʻahu describes Kahiki, a term used for all lands outside Hawaiʻi:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ua ʻike hoʻi au iā Kahiki''

''He moku leo pāhaʻohaʻo wale Kahiki''

''ʻAʻohe o Kahiki kanaka''

''Hoʻokahi o Kahiki kanaka – he Haole''&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

This roughly translates to: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have seen Kahiki

Kahiki is an island with a puzzling language

Kahiki has no people

Except for one kind—a foreign kind&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this chant, the word "haole" has no glottal stops or elongated vowels. The pronunciation of the word to mean "breathless" is conjecture and should be disregarded as myth, as there is absolutely no evidence of anyone using the word "hāʻole" prior to Western contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Hawaiʻi: Center of the Pacific|work=Hawaiian Studies 107 Reader|edition=2nd|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==


In Hawaii's "Rainbow" ethnic melange of peoples, "Haole" is the slang word used to describe Caucasians, and by itself is not a racial slur and has no pejorative connotations. Many visitors are haole, and may be targeted by criminals, but this is because they are vulnerable tourists, not because they are haole. Rumors that in Hawaii the last day of school is called "[[Kill Haole Day]]" is nothing but a rumor. According to this rumor, on this day, "local" (nonwhite) children beat up, bully, and harass the "haole" or "[[White and European people in Hawaii|white]]" children in their school. Some residents say there is little to no evidence or documentation of incidents involving "Kill Haole Day" or of Caucasian students being assaulted on specific days. Other residents dispute this. Hawaii schools have responded by saying that they take the initiative to achieve tolerance, safety, compassion, and acceptance for all students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/2010/11/16/hawaii-news/lee-cataluna/kill-haole-day-myth-diverts-attention-from-real-problems/|title='Kill Haole Day' myth diverts attention from real problems|first=Lee|last=Cataluna|date=November 16, 2010|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "Haole" is used as a racial slur or insult in incidents of harassment and physical assaults by Native Hawaiians and members of other "minority" (nonwhite) groups on [[white people]] in Hawaii—tourists as well as residents and military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Keller|date=August 30, 2009|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2009/hawaii-suffering-racial-prejudice|title=Hawaii Suffering From Racial Prejudice|publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Indigenous Environmental Network''' (IEN) is a network of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]], [[grassroots]] environmental justice activists, primarily based in the United States. Group members have represented [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] concerns at international events such as the '''United Nations Climate Change Conferences''' in [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen (2009)]] and [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Paris (2016)]]. IEN organizes an annual conference to discuss proposed goals and projects for the coming year; each year the conference is held in a different indigenous nation.&lt;ref name="Brook1"&gt;{{cite journal   | last = Brook   | first = Daniel  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Environmental Genocide: Native Americans and Toxic Waste  | work = American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Vol. 57, No. 1  | publisher = American Journal of Economics and Sociology, Inc.  | date = Jan 1998  | jstor = 3487423  | pages = 105–113  | volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network emphasizes environmental protection as a form of spiritual activism. IEN received attention in the news as a major organizer of the fight against the [[Keystone Pipeline]] and the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] in the [[Dakota Access Pipeline protests]].

== History ==
The IEN was formed in 1990 to bring to light environmental and economic injustices faced specifically by the Indigenous Peoples of North America.&lt;ref name="IEN-6" /&gt;

=== Ties to environmental justice movement ===
The [[environmental justice]] movement seeks to address issues of [[environmental racism]], which arises when [[people of color]] and other marginalized populations such as Indigenous Peoples are disproportionately affected by exposure to hazardous environmental conditions; the unavailability of safe, healthy, and affordable food options; and exclusion from participatory involvement in community decision-making.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Indigenous peoples have historically suffered injustice through environmental racism, having faced repeated despoilation of sacred lands as well as over-exploitation of resources by governments and other actors. This includes dumping, establishment of toxic waste sites, or development of environmentally harmful infrastructure (such as pipelines), specifically on Native American [[Indian reservation|reservations]] and [[First Nations]] [[Indian reserve|reserves]]. Breaches of Indigenous autonomy by the [[United States|U.S.]] Government are often justified by the claim that the development of Indigenous lands would increase economic opportunity for locals{{mdash}}claims that are rarely supported by evidence. Indigenous residents and custodians usually see development projects imposed in this manner as an infringement on their right to self-determination and religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|date=November 2010|title=Indigenous Struggles, Environmental Justice, and Community Capabilities|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/glep_a_00029#.WQs_6RMrLIU|journal=Global Environmental Politics|volume=10|pages=12–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The network has focused its activism on improving Indigenous communities through grassroots efforts; prioritizing projects that protect the land, air, water, sacred sites, and natural resources. To accomplish the preservation of these assets, the network has organized campaigns, public awareness, and community building activities. The IEN meets locally, regionally, and nationally to promote awareness about issues of social justice, but primarily holds focus in North America.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;!--OVERFLOGGING THE ISSUE: The rise of the IEN came out of the recognition of the harm done to the livelihood of Indigenous Peoples.--&gt;The increase in toxic waste and nuclear waste storage facilities near indigenous lands was a main concern to the IEN during its beginnings in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ienearth.org/|title=Indigenous Environmental Network|website=www.ienearth.org|language=en-US|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial focus on environmental hazards presented by these facilities, the network spread awareness across youth and tribal populations that paved the way for it to progress to campaigns and public activism. Every year, a conference is held entitled "Protecting Mother Earth Gatherings", which is aimed at educating the public as well as developing strategies for protecting the lands of Indigenous Peoples.

In 1995, IEN began hiring staff to represent the ideologies and goals of the organization. IEN workers strive for the preservation of Indigenous Peoples through tribal grassroots communities and tribal-government environmental staff. IEN has since evolved into a group that works to create change and strengthen tribal communities by protecting and preserving sacred sites.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Current activism ===
One of the popular cases of activism that IEN has participated in were the protests against the North Dakota Pipeline project, which is set to run through [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Iowa]] and to end in [[Illinois]]. The IEN has been a leading participant in coordinating international action such as bank divestments and days of emergency action that protest [[fascism]] and the use of [[fossil fuel]]s that disrupt the livelihood of Indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Indigenous Rising Media '' is an IEN Project that works to defend the rights of Indigenous Peoples. It focuses on protecting the sanctity and integrity of [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]] and the movement towards a more just and sustainable future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://indigenousrising.org/|title=Indigenous Rising|website=Indigenous Rising|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has placed information about the North Dakota Pipeline on its website aimed at combating the dangers that directly affect indigenous people.

The group also recently participated in the [[People's Climate March (2017)|Peoples Climate March]] on [[Washington, D.C.]] on April 29, 2017. The March was hosted to bring to light the dangers of climate change, and IEN supported the event. The rally was hosted by [[1491s#Members|Dallas Goldtooth]], a prominent activist protesting against the North Dakota Pipeline, along with Carrie Fulton, an [[African-American]] environmental-justice organizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/04/the-people-who-came-to-the-climate-march/524865/|title=The Climate March's Big Tent Strategy Draws a Big Crowd|last=Meyer|first=Robinson|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Peoples Climate March took place on the 100th day of [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency, and served as a protest to [[policy]] changes being made regarding environmental protection and [[conservation movement|conservation]].

== Goals and Beliefs  ==
[[File:Indigenous Environmental Network Interview.jpg|thumb|This image shows an interview being conducted of members of the Indigenous Environmental Network]]
[[File:Talk Nation Radio - 2008-08-10 Emily Surrusco, Arctic Wilderness League.vorb.oga|thumb|right|Tom Goldtooth of the Indigenous Environmental Network has an overview of his position on US drilling and native lands.]]
# Educate and empower Indigenous Peoples to address and develop strategies for the protection of our environment, our health, and all life forms – the Circle of Life.

# Recognize, support, and promote environmentally sound lifestyles, economic livelihoods and to build healthy sustaining Indigenous communities.
# Commitment to influence policies that affect Indigenous Peoples on a local, tribal, state, regional, national and international level.
# Include youth and elders in all levels of our work.
# Protect our human rights to practice our cultural and spiritual beliefs.&lt;ref name="IEN-6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ienearth.org/about|title=The Indigenous Environmental Network|last=|first=|authorlink=|date=|publisher=IEN|doi=|coauthors=|work=About IEN|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Beliefs in practice ===
Certain practices of coal mining, oil drilling, and fishing and hunting in the United States are said to directly infringe upon Native land and values. IEN tries to engage with the American public by raising consciousness about environmental issues that are known to have a particularly strong impact on indigenous peoples. One IEN action for this purpose was dedicating a day, October 13, 1996, to challenging Americans to consume as little energy as possible. The goal of this was to encourage people to think about how much energy they do in fact consume on a daily basis and how this impacts on native communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkins|first=Francis|date=Winter 1996|title=Unplug the Consumer Culture|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=9279e17b-1557-4fc1-9ccb-1cf6a78a626f%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4212&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=9603220743&amp;db=8gh|journal=Environmental Action|volume=27|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, at [[Bear Butte]], South Dakota (a sacred site to many of the [[Plains Indians]]), the IEN established an ''Environmental Code of Ethics''.&lt;ref name=Brook1/&gt; Key points include that indigenous people culturally, and Native Americans politically, are tied to their land; Native Americans in the United States and Canada are restricted to reservations if they want to maintain any kind of nationalistic ideals; and that indigenous people often have religious or ancestral ties to specific tracts of land.&lt;ref name=Brook1/&gt; This unique relationship makes it less likely for them to leave, makes the land more valuable, and makes them even more staunchly opposed to polluting it in any way.&lt;ref name=Brook1/&gt;

== Spiritual activism ==
The IEN states that part of their mission is to protect and maintain sites sacred to, primarily, indigenous communities in North America. In addressing perceived injustices perpetuated against these peoples, they list protection of sacred, historical and culturally significant areas as one of their main goals. In doing so, they reference their love for Mother Earth as a driving force behind their activism. IEN recognizes humanity's connection to the Earth and believes their activism is restoring and furthering this connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ienearth.org/about/|title=About {{!}} Indigenous Environmental Network|website=www.ienearth.org|language=en-US|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group holds "Protecting Mother Earth Gatherings", in which they discuss techniques and plans for protecting indigenous communities and lands. In their "Rights of Mother Earth" conference held in April 2004, they expressed their commitment in "creating a system of jurisprudence that sees and treats nature and Mother Earth as a fundamental, rights bearing entity." They also argued for a paradigm founded on indigenous thought as well as a philosophy that grants equal rights to nature and honors the interrelationship of all life forms on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ienearth.org/rights-of-mother-earth-restoring-indigenous-life-ways-of-responsibility-and-respect/|title=Rights of Mother Earth {{!}} Indigenous Environmental Network|website=www.ienearth.org|language=en-US|access-date=April 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental justice ==

=== Pipelines ===
The group began garnering more public attention in 2014, when they began a protest against the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Initial disputes over the pipeline had drawn the attention of the American public in 2011, when groups became concerned that the oil pipeline could contaminate nearby water sources, but this increased as the building of the pipeline was delayed. IEN was one of the larger organizations involved in the debate over the pipeline, allying with other environmentalist groups like the Sierra Club and 350.org &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/25/us/keystone-xl-pipeline-fight-lifts-environmental-movement.html|title=Pipeline Fight Lifts Environmental Movement|work=The New York Times|date=January 24, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2017|last=Wheaton|first=Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEN experienced another surge of media exposure in 2015 as protests against the Dakota Access oil pipeline gained attention. The pipeline is currently complete, with the exception of the section mapped to be located under Lake Oahe, which is a major water source for the native [[Sioux|Sioux tribe]] [[Standing Rock Indian Reservation|of Standing Rock North Dakota.]] After a federal order requiring protesters to leave the build sites of the pipeline, IEN stated publicly that they would not follow the order in an attempt to further delay the progression of the pipeline. Dallas Goldtooth, an organizer with IEN, told a reporter for the [[Washington Post]] that "We are staying here, committed to our prayer. Forced removal and state oppression? This is nothing new to us as native people." &lt;ref name=Sylvester&gt;Sylvester, Terray. "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-40265280.html?refid=easy_hf Foes of Pipeline Vow to Defy Order to Leave Site]" ''[[The Washington Post]]'', November 27, 2016. Accessed February 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom B.K. Goldtooth]], founder of IEN, stated after President Donald Trump signed an executive order for the continuation of the building of the pipeline that "Donald Trump will not build his Dakota Access Pipeline without a fight. The granting of an easement, without any environmental review or tribal consultation, is not the end of this fight—it is the new beginning." &lt;ref&gt;"Indigenous Environmental Network: Trump Can't Build DAPL Without a Fight." Common Dreams. February 7, 2017. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2017/02/07/indigenous-environmental-network-trump-cant-build-dapl-without-fight&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
IEN hosts annual conferences called the "Protecting Mother Earth Gatherings". The maiden edition held in 1990 in Bear Butte, South Dakota. The conferences has changed location almost every year.

At the conference, members of the Network come together to discuss the group's goals and projects in the upcoming year. Their resolutions are typically published on the internet soon after the end of each conference.&lt;ref&gt;1992. "Resolution of the Third Annual Indigenous Environmental Network Gathering, Celilo Village, Oregon, June 6, 1992: No Nuclear Waste on Indian Lands." Race, Poverty &amp; the Environment, 1992. 9. JSTOR Journals, EBSCOhost (accessed February 19, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Past conference locations and projects include:
* The 1992 conference in [[Celilo Falls]], Oregon, formerly a major [[salmon]] fishing site until dams were constructed on the Columbia River, downstream from the [[Hanford Nuclear Reservation]].
* The 1993 conference at [[Sac and Fox Reservation]], Oklahoma; IEN helped defeat a proposal for the establishment of a nuclear waste site.
* The 1994 conference on [[Mole Lake Indian Reservation]], Wisconsin, where Exxon plans to open a huge zinc-copper mine upstream from the Mole Lake Chippewa's wild rice beds.
* The 2001 conference (the 12th Protecting Mother Earth Gathering) in [[Penticton, British Columbia]], Canada, was the first to be held in Canada.
* The 2004 conference was again held near sacred Bear Butte, South Dakota.&lt;ref name=Grossman1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grossman |first=Zoltan |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Linking the Native Movement for Sovereignty and the Environmental Movement |work=Native Americans and the Environment |publisher=Z Magazine 8(11) |date=November 1995 |url=http://ncseonline.org/nae/docs/grossman.html |pages=42–50 |accessdate=April 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616234942/http://ncseonline.org/nae/docs/grossman.html |archivedate=June 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, IEN introduced the "Red Road to [[Copenhagen]]" initiative; a delegation attended the 15th Session of the [[United Nations Climate Change conference|Conference of the Parties]] (COP-15) to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in Copenhagen. The Initiative statement reads: "...this initiative will bring accumulated traditional knowledge of Indigenous peoples from North America coming from climate-energy impact zones and persons experienced in linking an indigenous rights-based framework to climate policy."&lt;ref name=COP15&gt;{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = IEN COP15 delegation Information  | work =  | publisher = IEN  | date =  | url =  | doi =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IEN prioritizes multigenerational and intertribal organizing, and has specific youth and elders groups. It is governed partly by an Elders Council; their Youth Council solicits the involvement of young Indigenous people and tries to make connections between urban youth culture and environmental issues faced by the communities.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web  | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = The Indigenous Environmental Network  | work = About IEN  | publisher = IEN  | date = | url = http://www.ienearth.org/about  | doi =  | accessdate = April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of IEN were involved in the 2016 Dakota Access Pipeline protests, notably in the media coverage and in establishing the media tent at the [[Oceti Sakowin]] camp.&lt;ref name=CdreamsMedia&gt;{{cite web  | last = Begay | first = Jade | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Indigenous Women Leaders of Dakota Access Pipeline Resistance to Speak Out For Protection of Earth and Water  | work = About IEN  | publisher = [[Common Dreams]]  | date = September 28, 2016| url = http://www.commondreams.org/newswire/2016/09/28/indigenous-women-leaders-dakota-access-pipeline-resistance-speak-out-protection  | doi =  | accessdate = October 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other Work ===
The [[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]] Treaty, now known as the [[Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants|Stockholm Convention]] after it was signed in May 2001 in [[Sweden]], was designed to ban a number of pesticides and other chemicals from use. During the negotiations, IEN played a key role in expressing to delegates what indigenous peoples wanted from the treaty. Throughout the period, the IEN met with delegates from all over the world in order to sensitise them on how indigenous peoples are impacted by POPs and their expectations from the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rohde|first=Monica|date=Spring 2001|title=Community Groups Have Big Impact on POPs Treaty|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=16&amp;sid=a5c14f39-6df1-4439-b952-1579dfad32df%40sessionmgr4006&amp;hid=4104&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=8772388&amp;db=8gh|journal=Everyone's Backyard|volume=19|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation]] (REDD) is a policy mechanism designed to work for the preservation of global forests and it is backed by many influential environmental organizations like [[Greenpeace]] and [[Conservation International]]. REDD is centered around the idea of providing forest owners with financial incentive to preserve them. However, in accomplishing this, it also requires the relocation of indigenous peoples who reside in forests that are being targeted and is therefore very controversial among grassroots and indigenous organizations. IEN publicly opposes REDD, claiming that it is a direct violation of the rights of indigenous peoples to have autonomy over their own land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conant|first=Jeff|date=Autumn 2011|title=Do Trees Grow on Money?|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/do_trees_grow_on_money/|journal=Earth Island Journal|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kin Canada''' (formerly the '''Kinsmen and Kinette Clubs of Canada''') is a secular [[Canada|Canadian]] [[non-profit]] [[service organization]] that promotes [[Community Service|service]], fellowship, [[Value (personal and cultural)|positive values]], and [[national pride]].

'''Kin Canada''' is an organization whose members comprise Kinsmen, Kinette and Kin Clubs ([[service club]]s) located in [[Canada]]. Membership is open to all persons regardless of race, colour, or creed.

== Members ==
Around 7,000 members belong to about 500 Kinsmen, Kinette and Kin clubs from coast to coast. Kinsmen clubs are predominantly male-only while Kinette clubs are predominantly female-only. Kin clubs have a mixed membership of men and women. The Association was founded in Canada and there are no clubs outside of Canada.

== History ==
[[File:Children. Kinsmen Boys' Club Rosemont BAnQ P48S1P07459.jpg|thumb|left|Kinsmen Boys' Club of Rosemont in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] in 1942]]
In 1920, [[Harold A. Rogers]], known in Kin Canada circles as "Founder Hal", founded the first Kinsmen club in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Rogers, a 21-year-old, had just returned from [[World War I]] and his father, a well-known Rotarian, encouraged him to join the [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]]. Rogers was rejected because the Rotary Club would not allow two members from the same business establishment. Not a person to be outdone, Rogers decided to create a new club. As a result of his initiative, a small group of like-minded men gathered for a dinner meeting on February 20, 1920 and formed what became known as the Kinsmen Club of Hamilton &amp;ndash; Canada's first Kinsmen Club.

==Prominent members==
Prominent former and current Kin members include:

* [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[John Diefenbaker]].
* [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Ray Hnatyshyn]].
* [[Premier of Ontario|Ontario Premier]]  [[Ernie Eves]].
* [[Ontario]] MPP [[Bruce Crozier]].   
* [[British Columbia]] cabinet minister [[Rich Coleman]]&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.news.gov.bc.ca/releases/news_releases_2005-2009/2005OTP0071-000583-Attachment4.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] MHA, MP, 12th Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland and Labrador [[John C. Crosbie]].
* [[Senate of Canada]] MHA, MP, Former Liberal Senator for St. John's East, Newfoundland and Labrador [[Eric Cook]].
* [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] MHA, Former Leader of the Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador [[Len Stirling]].
* [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] MHA, 9th Mayor of the City of [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador]] [[William G. Adams]].

==Projects==
Each club raises funds and determines how to spend those funds in its community. Together, the clubs raised CAD $18.32 million in the 2010-2011 Kin year.

The [[Kinsmen Field House]], a sports venue in Edmonton, was created with Kin funding.

=== Cystic fibrosis ===
Since 1964, Kin Canada has supported [[Cystic Fibrosis Canada]], raising as much as CAD $1 million a year for [[cystic fibrosis]] (CF) research and treatment. To date, Kin have raised more than $39 million for CF. This makes Kin the country's largest single fundraiser for cystic fibrosis.

===Kin Canada Bursaries===
[http://www.bursary.ca Kin Canada Bursaries], a program of the Hal Rogers Endowment Fund, provides financial assistance to eligible persons in their quest for higher learning. Kin Canada established the Hal Rogers Endowment Fund upon the passing of founder [[Harold A. Rogers|Hal Rogers]].

===Kin Canada Foundation===
The Kin Canada Foundation is an incorporated and federally chartered charitable organization established in 2005 to help Kin Canada achieve the objective of "Serving the Community’s Greatest Need". The Foundation's primary goal is to work hand-in-hand with Kin Canada to help resource and develop many of the programs provided for the benefit of the members across Canada.

===Organ Donor Awareness===
The Kin Organ Donor Awareness Campaign (Kin-ODAC) was established in 2001 at National Convention to improve awareness and education about the importance of organ donation across Canada.

===Telemiracle===
[[Telemiracle]] is a [[telethon]] organized by the Kinsmen and Kinettes in [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]] for the benefit of the Kinsmen Telemiracle Foundation, a Kin Canada affiliate in Saskatchewan. Initially broadcast on both [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] and [[CBC Television|CBC]] affiliates in Saskatchewan, it is now broadcast, commercial-free, exclusively on the province's CTV stations.

The first telethon, in 1977, raised more than CAD $1 million, which at the time was considered a record for per capita telethon fund-raising in a 20-hour period (the province had a population of only about 1 million people at the time). The telethon passed the $2 million mark for the first time in 1983. And in recent years, the telethon has routinely raised between $3.0 and $3.5 million each year.

The phrase '''King of Kings''' ([[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] ''{{lang|akk|šar šarrāni}}'', [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] {{lang|he|מֶלֶךְ מְלָכִים}} ''melek mĕlakîm'', {{lang-fa|شاهنشاه|translit=šāhanšāh}}, {{lang-gr|Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων}} ''Basileus Basileōn'') is a [[superlative]] expression for "[[great king]]" or [[high king]]; it is probably originally of [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] origins (compare the superlatives [[Lord of Lords (disambiguation)|Lord of Lords]], [[Song of Songs]] or [[Holy of Holies]]),&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; but from there was also adopted in [[Persian Empire|Persian]] (''[[Shahanshah]]''),&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Persia |volume=21 |page=198 |first=Karl Hermann |last=Ethé}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hellenistic era|Hellenistic]]
and [[Christendom|Christian]] traditions.

==Historical usage==

===Assyrian Empire===
The first king known to use the title "king of kings" (''{{lang|akk|šar šarrāni}}'') was [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] of Assyria (13th century BC). The title used to be intended quite literally, as a ''šar'' or ''[[malik|mlk]]'' was the title of a king of a [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|city-state]], and with the formation of an [[empire]] in the Late Bronze Age, the Assyrian rulers installed themselves as rulers over the existing structure of rulers (kings) of city-states.&lt;ref&gt;Lowell K. Handy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fx1by4b1HzEC&amp;pg=PA112 ''Among the host of Heaven: the Syro-Palestinian pantheon as bureaucracy''], 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-931464-84-3}}, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was adopted in [[Biblical Hebrew]], as {{lang|he|מֶלֶךְ מְלָכִים}}, in reference to Babylonian king [[Nebuchadnezzar]] in [[Ezekiel]] 26:7. The same usage appears in [[Old Aramaic language|Aramaic]] portions of the [[Book of Daniel]] 2:37, where Nebuchadnezzar is called {{lang|oar|מֶלֶךְ מַלְכַיָּא}}.

===Ancient Persia===

The first written record of consistent use of the title dates to the kings of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The title King of Kings ([[Old Persian]]: ''Xšâyathiya Xšâyathiyânâm'') was one of the titles borne by [[Cyrus the Great]], and later all other Achaemenid kings, who were in fact ruling over provincial governors, the [[satrap]]s.

The Persian usage also appears in [[Ezra]] 7:12 in reference to [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes I]].

The Old Persian title was evolved into [[Middle Persian]] ''shâhân shâh'', and later into [[New Persian]] ''shâhanshâh'' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|ʃ|ɑː|ə|n|ˈ|ʃ|ɑː}}; {{lang|fa|[[wikt:شاهنشاه|شاهنشاه]]}})&lt;ref&gt;"Shahanshah, n.". OED Online. March 2011. Oxford University Press. 4 June 2011 &lt;http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/177290?redirectedFrom=shahanshah&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle Persian word was used by the kings of [[Sassanian Empire]], who were indeed the ruler of the many feudal kings in Persia. The New Persian word was later revived by some [[post-Islamic|Islamic]] dynasties in Persia with the meaning "great king".

===Hellenistic era===
There is no evidence that [[Alexander the Great]] ever took the title "king of kings" (βασιλεὺς βασιλέων). Instead, he used "king of Asia" (βασιλεὺς τῆς Ἀσίας).&lt;ref&gt;Fredricksmeyer, Ernst. “Alexander the Great and the Kingship of Asia.” In Alexander the Great in Fact and Fiction, edited by A. B. Bosworth and E.J. Baynham, 136–66. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tigranes II]] of [[Greater Armenia|Armenia]] (140&amp;nbsp;– 55 BC) used a title equivalent to "king of kings".&lt;ref&gt;David Engels: ''Überlegungen zur Funktion der Titel "Großkönig" und "König der Könige" vom 3. zum 1. Jh. v.Chr.''. In: Victor Cojocaru / Altay Coskun / Madalina Dana (eds.): Interconnectivity in the Mediterranean and Pontic World during the Hellenistic and the Roman Periods, Mega, Cluj-Napoca, 2014, p. 333-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Tigranes |volume=26 |page=969 |first=Eduard |last=Meyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title was used in the [[Donations of Alexandria]] ceremony in 34BC, where [[Caesarion]], son of [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Cleopatra VII]], was proclaimed as King of Kings, also as a status of a [[god]] and [[Son of God|son of god]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer Reinhold, ''Studies in classical history and society'', Oxford University Press US, 2002, p.58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of Georgia===
During the Middle Ages, the title ''mepet mepe'' which translates to "king of kings" or "king of the kings" was used as a title by Georgian monarchs such as [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar the Great]] to describe their rule over all Georgian principalities, vassals and tributaries, ''mepet mepoba'', or rule as king over kings. It is suggested to have derived from the Persian word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vashalomidze |first=Guliko Sophia |title=Die Stellung der Frau im alten Georgien: Georgische Geschlechterverhältnisse insbesondere während der Sasanidenzeit (Orientalia biblica et christiana, Band 16) |date=August 1, 2007 |chapter=Indizien für kulturelle Beeinflussung |page=151 |isbn=978-3447054591}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://theculturetrip.com/europe/georgia/articles/a-brief-history-of-georgias-only-female-king/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious usage==
===Judaism===
In [[Judaism]], ''Melech Malchei HaMelachim'' ("the King of Kings of Kings") came to be used as a [[Names of God in Judaism|name of God]], using the double superlative to put the title one step above the royal title of the Babylonian and Persian kings referred to in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Gluck |first=P.

===Christianity===
[[Image:Christ tsar.jpg|thumb|200px|"[[Christ]] as King of Kings". A Russian [[icon]] from [[Murom]] (1690)]]
{{see|Christ the King}}
[[Jesus Christ]] is called the "king of kings" (βασιλεὺς τῶν βασιλευόντων) once in the [[First Epistle to Timothy]] (6:15) and twice in the [[Book of Revelation]] (17:14, 19:16).

But "king of kings" has also been used as the title of a monarch in Christian tradition.
Βασιλεὺς Βασιλέων Βασιλεύων Βασιλευόντων (Basileus Basileon, Basileuon Basileuonton)
"King of Kings, Ruling over Those who Rule" was the motto of the Byzantine [[Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty|Palaiologos dynasty]].
The [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperors of Ethiopia]] had the title of "king of kings" (nəgusä nägäst).&lt;ref&gt;
[[Haile Selassie]]'s full title in office was "His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah, King of Kings of Ethiopia, Elect of God" ([[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]]: ግርማዊ፡ ቀዳማዊ፡ አፄ፡ ኃይለ፡ ሥላሴ፡ ሞዓ፡ አንበሳ፡ ዘእምነገደ፡ ይሁዳ፡ ንጉሠ፡ ነገሥት፡ ዘኢትዮጵያ፡ ሰዩመ፡ እግዚአብሔር; girmāwī ḳedāmāwī 'aṣē ḫayle śillāsē, mō'ā 'anbessā ze'imneggede yihudā niguse negest ze'ītyōṗṗyā, siyume 'igzī'a'bihēr).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
The (secular) title of "king of kings" is criticized in Sunni hadith, for example [[Sahih al-Bukhari]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira:

Allah's Apostle said, "The most awful name in Allah's sight on the Day of Resurrection, will be (that of) a man calling himself Malik Al-Amlak (the king of kings)."&lt;ref&gt;https://muflihun.com/bukhari/73/224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Narrated Abu Huraira:

The Prophet said, "The most awful (meanest) name in Allah's sight." Sufyan said more than once, "The most awful (meanest) name in Allah's sight is (that of) a man calling himself king of kings." Sufyan said, "Somebody else (i.e. other than Abu Az-Zinad, a sub-narrator) says: What is meant by 'The king of kings' is 'Shahan [[Shah]].,"&lt;ref&gt;https://muflihun.com/bukhari/73/225&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A related phrase ''Malik Al-Mulk'' ("King of the Realm"), is one of the [[Names of God in Islam|99 names of Allah]].

==Modern usage==
===Monarchs and autocrats===
{{anchor|King of Kings of Africa|Libya}}

The title ''shahanshah'' was revived by the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] of Persia in the 20th century. It was abolished when the Islamic Revolution toppled the monarchy in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Iranian revolution&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Muammar Gaddafi]] of Libya claimed to be 'King of Kings,' a title that he subsequently had a gathering of African [[tribal chief]]s endorse in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;the CNN Wire Staff, "[http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/08/19/libya.gadhafi.profile/index.html As ruler, Gadhafi sought world stage]," ''CNN'' (August 25, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; More "than 200 African kings and traditional rulers...bestowed the title 'king of kings' on Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi" during a meeting "in the Libyan town of Benghazi in what was billed as a first of its kind. Gaddafi urged the royals to join his campaign for African unity....'We want an African military to defend Africa, we want a single African currency, we want one African passport to travel within Africa,' Gaddafi told the assembled dignitaries, who come from countries such as Mozambique, South Africa, Ivory Coast and the Democratic Republic of Congo."

Variations of the traditional title of the [[Ethiopian]] kings, "niguse negest", were held by the rulers of the imperial realms of [[Mali]] in [[West Africa]], [[Asanteman]], also in [[West Africa]], and [[Zulu Kingdom|Zululand]] in [[Southern Africa]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Popular culture===
[[WWE]] wrestler [[Triple H]] is also dubbed as "The King of Kings", and uses the [[Motörhead]] song "King of Kings" in his ring entrances.

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[A Star Is Burns]]", an actor starring in [[Mr. Burns]]' movie "A Burns for All Seasons" referred to him as being truly "The King of Kings".

In the movie ''[[300 (film)|300]]'', [[Xerxes I of Persia|King Xerxes I]] referred to himself as King of Kings.

In [[Percy Shelley]]'s sonnet, ''[[Ozymandias]]'', Ozymandias refers to himself as "King of Kings" in line 10.

In ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[Jesus, Mary and Joseph!]]", Jesus is referred as "King of Kings"

In ''[[The Transformers (TV series)|The Transformers]]'', the character Abdul Fakkadi is the self-professed Supreme Military Commander, President-for-Life, and '''King of Kings''' of the Socialist Democratic Federated Republic of Carbombya.

In ''[[Destiny]]'' Blaze is "King of Kings".

The '''Luwo''' (also called '''Jo Luo ''' and '''Luo of Bahr el Ghazal''') are an ethnic group in western parts of [[South Sudan]]. They are part of a larger group of ethno-linguistically related [[Luo peoples]] of East Africa.&lt;ref name="peoplegroups"&gt;{{cite web|title=Luwo of South Sudan|url=http://www.peoplegroups.org/Explore/groupdetails.aspx?peid=12091|publisher=PeopleGroups.org|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They speak the [[Dheluo language]] which is a [[Luo languages|Northern Luo language]].&lt;ref name=lwo-ethnologue&gt;{{cite web|title=Luwo|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/lwo/|publisher=SIL International|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurtong-Luo"/&gt;

They are related to the [[Dholuo]] speaking [[Joluo]] of [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]]. The date of divergence is estimated to have been about eight centuries ago.&lt;ref name="Gurtong-editorial"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/10890/There-is-No-Jur-Chol-Tribe-but-Luo-Tribe-in-Western-Bahr-el-Ghazal-State-Speaker.aspx|title=There Is No Jur Chol Tribe But Luo Tribe In Western Bahr El Ghazal State: Speaker|publisher=Gurtong Trust|website=www.gurtong.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
The Luwo are known to the dinka as Jur Chol which is an exonym taken from the [[Dinka language]] (compare [[Jur Beli]]). Some Luo politicians object to the name.&lt;ref name="Gurtong-editorial"/&gt;

== Culture ==
The Luo reside in the [[Jur River County|Jur River]] and [[Wau County|Wau]] counties of [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]] State and in Aweil Center County of [[Northern Bahr el Ghazal]] State. The Luo are also [[sedentary]], meaning they have a centralized living area. They grow [[sorghum]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potato]]es, and [[bean]]s. They can [[fishing]], [[hunting]], and [[beekeeping]], making them a well rounded society.&lt;ref name="Gurtong-Luo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gurtong.net/Peoples/ThePeopleandDemographicsofSouthSudan/JurcholLuo/tabid/199/Default.aspx|title=Jurchol (Luo)|last=Trust|first=Gurtong|website=www.gurtong.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
The Luwo are one of the smaller tribes of South Sudan with population about 171,000 - by some accounts the Luo are the 8th largest ethnic group in South Sudan. They may be found in [[Aweil (state)|Aweil]], [[Wau (state)|Wau]] and [[Tonj (state)|Tonj]] states or in [[Tonj (state)|Tonj]] and [[Western Bahr el Ghazal]] and [[Northern Bahr el Ghazal]] states by the [[States of South Sudan|pre-2015 organisation]].&lt;ref name="Gurtong-Luo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refworld"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4bea5d622.html|title=Distribution of Ethnic Groups in Southern Sudan (as of 24 Dec 2009)|date=6 January 2010|website=Refworld|publisher=UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA)|access-date=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''macana''', of [[Taíno people|Taíno]] origin, refers to various wooden weapons used by the various native cultures of [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]].

The earliest meaning attributed to ''macana'' is a sword-like weapon made out of wood, but still sharp enough to be dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], ''Decades de Orbe Novo'' (written in the early 16th century):
* {{lang|la|Cominus hi certant vt plurimum, ensibus oblongis, quos macanas ipsi appellant, ligneis tamen, quia ferrum non assequuntur...}}
: "In hand to hand combat they generally use long swords, which they call ''macanas'', which are however made of wood, as they don't have knowledge of iron." (p. 127)
* {{lang|la|armatum ... arcubus putà &amp; sagittis, machanísque, id est, ensibus amplis, ligneis, oblongis, vtráque manu agitandis...}}
: "...armed ... for example with bows and arrows, ''and macanas''—that is, with large, wooden, long swords which are wielded two-handedly" (p. 180)&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also sometimes applied to the similar [[Aztec]]  weapon, which is studded with pieces of [[obsidian]] in order to create a blade, though some authorities distinguish this item by using the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name {{lang|nci|[[macuahuitl]]}}.

The Inca army also made use of a 'macana spear'. It consisted of a wooden shaft with a heavy metal or stone object at the end. This object was often in a star shape, to maximise the potential to break bone. They were the most common weapon in the Inca arsenal, and it is possible that gold or silver was used for the star for high-ranking officers.

In modern [[Spanish language|Spanish]] the word has broadened to refer to various types of blunt wooden weapons, especially a police [[baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]].

'''Mahmud Shah Durrani Sadozai''' (1769 – April 18, 1829; [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Arabic]]: {{Nastaliq| محمود شاہ درانی سدوزئی}})  was born Prince and the ruler of the [[Durrani Empire]] (Afghanistan) between 1801 and 1803, and again between 1809 and 1818. An ethnic [[Sadduzai]] tribe section of the [[Popalzai]] sub clan of [[Durrani]] [[Durrani|Abdali]]  [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]], he was the son of [[Timur Shah Durrani]] and grandson of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]].

==His 1st and 2nd deposed==
Mahmud Shah Durrani was the half-brother of his predecessor, [[Zaman Shah Durrani|Zaman Shah]]. On July 25, 1801, Zaman Shah was deposed, and Mahmud Shah ascended to ruler-ship. He then had a chequered career; he was deposed in 1803, restored in 1809, and finally deposed again in 1818.

==Trouble with Barakzai tribe==
The elder brother of [[Dost Mohammad Khan]], the chief of the Barakzai, Fateh Khan, took an important part in raising Mahmud Shah Durrani to the sovereignty of Afghanistan in 1800 and in restoring him to the throne in 1809. The son of Mahmud Shah Durrani [[Shahzada Kamran Durrani]] was always in trouble with Amir Fateh Khan Barakzai, the brother of Dost Muhammad Khan. Mahmud Shah repaid Fateh Khan's services by having him assassinated in 1818. After the assassination of Fateh Khan Barakzai the fall of the Durrani Empires begun, thus incurring the enmity of his tribe. After a bloody conflict, Mahmud Shah was deprived of all his possessions but [[Herat]], the rest of his dominions being divided among Fatteh Khan's brothers. King Mahmud Shah Durrani died in 1829. The country was then ruled by [[Shuja Shah Durrani]]; another of his half-brothers.

'''Martin Guevara Urbina''' (1972) is a Mexican-born American author, writer, researcher, professor, and speaker who, as a [[sociologist]] and [[criminologist]],  works on Latina and Latino issues in the United States.&lt;ref name="Urbina"&gt;[http://faculty.sulross.edu/murbina Martin Guevara Urbina], Rio Grande College.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Martin Guevara Urbina: Education, Knowledge, Success"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KsPApmmwRY&amp;feature=youtu.be YouTube Video], YouTube Video.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Urbina was born (February 25, 1972) in [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Mexico]] to Felipa Guevara and Salvador Urbina. At the age of seven, he was taken to the United States, spending his childhood in various places in Texas before settling in [[Ozona, Texas]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;"New CJ faculty member:  When dreams become realty."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UWM"&gt;[http://www.wmich.edu/wmu/news/2000/0011/0001-127.html Western Michigan University News], News.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, he entered the   first grade in [[Carta Valley, Texas]], moving to Ozona, Texas in 1982, during his fourth grade year; he later attended the [[Rocksprings, Texas]] High School, and eventually graduated from [[Ozona High School]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="Life"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martin Guevara Urbina"&gt;[http://faculty.sulross.edu/murbina Martin Guevara], Rio Grande College.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then attended [[Western Texas College]] in [[Snyder, Texas]], transferring in 1993 to [[Sul Ross State University]] in Alpine, Texas, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1995.  While at Sul Ross he studied under [[Felipe de Ortego y Gasca]], considered the principal scholar of the Chicano Renaissance and founder of Chicano literary history with his book ''Backgrounds of Mexican American Literature'' (1971).&lt;ref name="Good Teachers Never Die."&gt;Urbina, Martin Guevara (2003).  "Good Teachers Never Die."  ''Hispanic Outlook in Higher Education'', 13:  31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Influenced by Ortego, he pursued graduate studies at  [[New Mexico State University]], where he graduated with a master's degree (M.C.J.) in 1997.&lt;ref name="Good Teachers Never Die." /&gt;  At New Mexico, he started researching the sociological elements of the U.S. judicial system.  In the summer of 1997, he began further graduate work at  [[Western Michigan University]], graduating with a Ph.D. in sociology in 2000.  At Western Michigan, he began to examine the implications, utility, and significance of various social issues in research and publication, especially in the areas of race and ethnic relations, capital punishment, law and society, and social justice.  While at Western Michigan, he began formulating   his theory on the scope and nature of the death penalty, "the four-threat theory of death sentence outcomes,"  as published in his first book, ''Capital Punishment and Latino Offenders:  Racial and Ethnic Differences in Death Sentences'' (2003).

==Academic career==
He then took a faculty position at the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]], where he developed a research agenda with a focus on ethnicity, race, gender, and other social issues.&lt;ref name="Life" /&gt;" &lt;ref&gt;''Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy'' (2004).  "Defining the Problem," http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic765870.files/HJHP_2004.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2000, he has analyzed ethnic, racial, gender, and socioeconomic disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system,  as affected by   national and international social control wars, like the war on crime, the war on narcotics (drugs), the war on immigrants, and more recently the war on terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;"Treatment of Hispanics covered in RGC professors' new book."  ''Alpine Avalanche'', October 18, 2012,  http://www.alpineavalanche.com/news/article_d61ed024-192d-11e2-82d0-001a4bcf887a.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CH1&gt;''Choice'', December 2012, [http://cro2.org/default.aspx?page=reviewdisplay&amp;pid=3793359] "Urbina provides extensive statistical, referential, and descriptive evidence to buttress his thesis"&lt;/ref&gt;

Urbina is author, coauthor, or editor of over 60 scholarly publications  including several academic books. His research has been published in national and international academic journals, to include ''Justice Quarterly''; ''Critical Criminology:  An International Journal''; and ''Social Justice:  A Journal of Crime, Conflict &amp; World Order''.&lt;ref name="Martin Guevara Urbina"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International Journal of Comparative and Applied Criminal Justice'' (2010), http://cro2.org/default.aspx?page=reviewdisplay&amp;pid=3793359.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mossi''' (or ''Mole'', ''Mosse'', [[grammatical number|sing.]] ''Moaaga'') are a people in central [[Burkina Faso]], living mostly in the villages of the Nazinon and Nakanbe (formerly [[Volta River|Volta) River]] Basin. The Mossi are the largest ethnic group in Burkina Faso, constituting more than 40% of the population,&lt;ref name="population" /&gt; or about 6.2 million people. The other 60% of Burkina Faso's population is composed of more than 60 ethnic groups, mainly the [[Gurunsi]], [[Senufo people|Senufo]], [[Lobi people|Lobi]], [[Bobo people|Bobo]] and [[Fula people|Fulani]].&lt;ref name=UIowa /&gt; The Mossi speak the [[Mòoré language]].

==History==
{{History of Burkina Faso}}
The Mossi people originated in Burkina Faso, although significant numbers of Mossi live in neighboring countries, including [[Benin]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Ghana]], [[Mali]], and [[Togo]]. In 1996, the estimated population of Burkina Faso was 10,623,323. Five to six million are probably Mossi; another 1.2 million Mossi live in Côte d'Ivoire.

===Legendary origins===
According to tradition, the Mossi comes from the marriage of a [[Mamprusi]] princess and [[Mandé]] hunter.

[[Yennenga]] was a warrior princess, daughter of a Mamprusi king in upper east [[Ghana]]. While exploring her kingdom on horseback, she lost her way and was rescued by Rialé, a solitary Mandé hunter. They got married and gave birth to the first authentic Mossi, [[Ouedraogo]], who is recognised as the father of Mossi people.

The Mossi are directly descended from the Mamprusi people and similarly live in upper east Ghana with a capital of Bawku/Nalerigu. These legendary origins apply only to the Nakomse, or the ruling class.

The Tengabisi and other Mossi peoples do not share these origin myths.

===[[Mossi Kingdoms]]===
As the Mossi people's history has been kept by oral tradition, it is impossible to assign precise dates for the period before [[colonization]].&lt;ref name="Laongo" /&gt; Nevertheless, historians assign the beginning of their existence as a state to the 15th century. The Mossi were able to conquer a vast amounts of territory thanks to their mastering of the horse, created a prosperous empire, and kept peace in the region until the beginning of [[colonialism]]. The expansion of the Mossi empire was stopped in the 19th century with the initiation of intensive colonisation by the French.&lt;ref name=UIowa /&gt;

===Colonial era===
French rule affected Mossi society and weakened the power of the Mossi [[emperor]], the ''[[Mogho Naaba]]''. Despite colonization, the Mogho Naaba was given some authority over the Mossi during the French colonial period. He is consulted today for crucial decisions, especially those affecting the destiny of society. Two great events have affected the status of the Mogho Naaba during colonization:

* During the initial phase of the French invasion, he retired to the Dagomba kingdom with which the Mossi have always kept brotherly relations.
* In 1896, the Mogho accepted the French [[protectorate]].

Though it has not been generally recognized, the Mossi played a key role in France's military during [[World War II]]. They constituted the greater part of the corps in the military troops of French West Africa, known in French as the ''Tirailleurs Sénégalais''.&lt;ref name="BF" /&gt;

==Organization of Mossi society==
The Mossi people have organised their society in an original hierarchic process in which family and state are the key elements.&lt;ref name=UIowa /&gt; The Mossi peoples are very heterogeneous. When horsemen invaded from the south they created a political or ruling class, called Nakomse, and a spiritual class called Tengabisi. All chiefs come from the ruling class. The Tengabisi include Saya, smiths, Nyonyose, farmers, Yarse, weavers and merchants, and others.

The origins of the Nyonyose are diverse: In the north their ancestors were Dogon and Kurumba, in the southwest their ancestors were Lela, Nuna, Sisala and others, and in the far east they were Gurmantche. These people were united into a new ethnicity called Mossi in about 1500.

It is a mistake to describe a "Nyonyosé tribe" or the "art of the Nyonyosé" because the Nyonyose do not exist outside Mossi society. All Nyonyosé are Mossi. At the same time, it is a mistake to assume that all segments of Mossi society are culturally identical, for the differences between the Nakomsé and the Tengabisi are striking; only the Tengabisi use masks, and only the Nakomsé use figures in the context of political celebrations. The Nakomse are the political class, and the Tengabisi are the spiritual class.

===[[Mogho Naba|Mogho Naaba]] and the Nakomse===
The highest position in Mossi society is that of the Emperor, who is given executive power. The Emperor's role is to rule the entire population and to protect the kingdom. Today, he lives in [[Ouagadougou]], the historical and present capital of [[Burkina Faso]]. Though the political dynamic of the country has changed, the ''Mogho Naaba'' (Emperor) is recognised by his people and has substantial authority.

[[File:Naaba Zomb Wobgo 2013.jpg|thumb|Naaba Zomb Wobgo, Andemtenga]]
Second to the Emperor come the nobles: ''[[Nakomse]]''. The Nakomse are all from the family of the Emperor, whether they be brothers, sisters, cousins, or otherwise. All dignitaries come from the Emperor's family. The Nakomse are often assigned territories in the kingdom as governorships and rule in the name of the Mogho Naaba. As in the past, the Emperor needs the support of his [[Nyon-nyonse]] (or gnon-gnon-sse) subjects to fully exercise his power. The Nyon-nyonse are the peoples who lived in Mossi-controlled regions before the Mossi.&lt;ref&gt;Tauxier, Louis. ''Le Noir du Yatenga''. Paris, Larose: 1917&lt;/ref&gt;

Mossi society is divided vertically into two major segments: the descendants of the horsemen who conquered the peoples on the Mossi plateau are called the Nakomse (“people of power”), and all Mossi chiefs come exclusively from the Nakomse class. These people use figures as political art to validate their rule over the peoples they conquered. The descendants of the ancient farming peoples who had occupied the land from the beginning of time and who, by right of first occupation, were and are the owners of the land are called the Tengabisi (“people of the earth”). These Tengabisi can be further divided into groups of smiths (Saya), groups of traders ([[Yarse]]) and, most important, groups of farmers (Nyonyose). Generally the smiths and the traders do not use masks, but the Nyonyose, the “ancient ones” are the principal makers and users of masks in Mossi society.

===Craftsmen and ordinary citizens===
[[File:Pg063 Arrivée d'une bande de Mossi.jpg|thumb|Arrival of a band of Mossi, 1892]]
They constitute the larger part of the population and are all subjects of the emperor. These two groups are generally fused but have internal subdivisions, each one having its own ruling family; they perform ceremonies and other important events. Mossi people often identify with groups; hence, at all levels, there is a [[hierarchy]] in Mossi society. In everyday life, the family hierarchy is most important, and family is often directly associated with the notion of [[hierarchy]] for the Mossi.

'Mogonaba' was what [[Leo Frobenius]] was told was the appropriate term for the emperor of Mossi at Wagadugu when he visited the country in 1904-6. His is one of the few disinterested reports as he was an [[anthropologist]] and not a missionary, representative of a European company, or military. He describes a court much like a European one (he may have an anti-aristocratic bias) with nobles in intrigues over commerce, power and industry. This report alone caused disbelief in Europe as no European source had ever considered Africans to be socially like Europeans. The lack of racism in Frobenius' report and his discovery of an industrious people and what some would describe as a glorious past interested [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] in Frobenius' other writings on Africa. Rudolf Blind's translation in English of the ''Voice of Africa,'' published by Hutchinson &amp; Co., produced some racist comments he thought necessary to conform with English sensitivities — otherwise he believed no Englishman would consider the book realistic.

An important contribution was made in the 1960s by the historian Elliott P. Skinner, who wrote at length about the sophistication of Mossi political systems in ''The Mossi of the Upper Volta: The Political Development of a Sudanese People.'' This was at a time when many African countries were gaining independence, and Skinner strongly made the point that African peoples were very clearly qualified to govern themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Eliott P., ''The Mossi of the Upper Volta: The Political Development of a Sudanese People,'' Stanford, Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language and cultural values==
Group identity and values within the Mossi and contrasted against other ethnic groups are tied first and foremost to [[language]].

===Mossi language===
{{main|Mossi language}}
The Mossi speak the [[More language]], of the Western Oti-Volta group of languages, northwestern sub-group. It is spoken in [[Burkina]], [[Ghana]], and [[Ivory Coast]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=[[Tony Naden|Naden]]|first1=Tony|title=Gur|date=1989|pages=141–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bendor-Samuel [ed.]|first1=J.T.|title=The Niger-Congo Languages|date=1989|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham MD}}&lt;/ref&gt; This language group is part of a larger grouping, [[Gur languages]] belonging to the Niger–Congo family. In the language there are a few dialects based mainly on region. For example, there is a dialect spoken in [[Yatenga]] ([[Ouahigouya]]), another distinct dialect in the northern region, a third in the southeast in [[Koupela]], different from a fourth dialect in the same region called [[Tenkodogo]].&lt;ref name=UIowa /&gt; Despite these regional differences, the dialects are [[mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Cultural values===
According to the explanations of Tapsoba Marie, the former Cultural Counsellor at Burkina Embassy in Senegal and Mossi herself, Mossi culture can be divided into four main values characteristic of the ethnic group.&lt;ref name="values" /&gt;

====Attitude towards ancestors====
Ancestors are believed to have reached a better world from which they can influence life on earth. They can help or punish their descendants depending on their behavior. Ancestors are also the judges that have the power to allow a descendant to enter the "pantheon of the ancestors". If an ancestor chooses to deny entrance, the soul of the disavowed one is condemned to run at random for all eternity. Because of these beliefs, Mossi swear by their ancestors or by the land; when they do so (which only occurs in extreme situations), it is more than symbolic — it is a call to imminent justice.

====Land====
Land is related to the ancestors, being a path by which one can access the ancestors.&lt;ref name="values" /&gt; Even today, this notion gives a unique value to land in Mossi thought. Land is considered to be much more than simple dust and has a spiritual dimension to it. A Mossi's life depends on his/her land, and it is essential for the family settlement.

====Family====
[[Family]] is an essential cultural element of the Mossi, who hold [[collectivism]] in high regard.&lt;ref name="values" /&gt; [[Individualism]] does not exist in traditional Mossi culture: one’s actions and behaviors are always taken to be characteristics of one's family. They must always ask an elder in order to do something. As a result, all are expected to act in their family's name; thus, the family is the smallest entity in the Mossi society. [[Tradition|Heritage]] is patrilineal, passed down from a father to his sons. However, when a man has no sons, women can inherit from their husbands and even from their father.

====Hierarchy====
Hierarchy is a fundamental concept for the Mossi and pervasive in their culture.&lt;ref name="values" /&gt; The family is organised like a kingdom with its king&amp;nbsp;— the husband and father, his advisor&amp;nbsp;— the wife, and the people&amp;nbsp;— the children. Aunts and uncles play a role by helping in the education and raising of children.

==Traditional and cultural holidays and events==
[[File:Troupe de danse de Andemtenga.jpg|thumb|The dance company of Andemtenga in action during the Nakoobo ceremony of the Mossi chief Naaaba Zomb Wobgo at Andemtenga, province Kouritenga, Burkina Faso]]
Ceremonies and celebrations pace the life of Mossi people, with each celebration having its particulars. Through them the community expresses joy or suffering, or simply fulfills duties to the memory of the ancestors.

===Mogho Naaba court===
The Friday [[Mogho Naaba]] court [[Moro-Naba Ceremony|ceremony]] derives from an event when the Moro Naba's sister fled north to the land of Yadega, the kingdom called Yatenga. As she fled north, she carried all of the amulets of power, or ''nam'', with her. The Moro Naba had to decide whether to follow her and retrieve his sacred power objects or to remain behind to rule over his people. Three times he left his palace to mount a white horse, and three times he returned to the palace. In the end he did not pursue his sister, and to this day the kings of Yatenga claim that they hold the power of Mossi rule.

The political segment of Mossi society, the Nakomse, use art to validate their rule. Bridles, saddles, stirrups and other objects associated with the horse are very important. In addition, Mossi chiefs use carved wooden figures to represent their royal ancestors. These figures are displayed each year at royal festivals called ''na possum,'' when the heads of each household in the community reaffirm their allegiance and loyalty to the chief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Chief_figures/Index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130702115359/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Chief_figures/Index.html |archivedate=2013-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mossi Masks===
[[Image:MossiMask.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Mossi Mask]]

The Nyonyose (the ancient farmers and spiritual segment of Mossi society) use masks in their religious observances and rituals. The Nakomse (chief class) do not use masks. Masks in initiations and funerals is typical of all the Voltaic or Gur-speaking peoples, including the Nyonyose, Lela, Winiama, Nouna, Bwaba, and Dogon. Masks appear at burials to observe on behalf of the ancestors that proper procedures are carried out. They appear at funeral or memorial services held at regular intervals over the few years after an elder has died. Masks attend to honor the deceased and to verify that the spirit of the deceased merits admission into the world of ancestors. Without a proper funeral, the spirit remains near the home and causes trouble for his/her descendants.

Masks are carved of the wood of the ''Ceiba pintandra,'' the faux kapokier. They are carved in three major styles that correspond to the styles of the ancient people who were conquered in 1500 by the invading Nakomse and integrated into a new Mossi society:

* In the north masks are vertical planks with a round concave or convex face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Mask_styles/Images/Yatenga/index.htm "Mask styles"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125174015/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Mask_styles/Images/Yatenga/index.htm |date=2009-11-25 }}, University of Iowa&lt;/ref&gt; 
* In the southwest masks represent animals such as antelope, bush buffalo, and strange creatures, and are painted red, white and black.
* In the east, around Boulsa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Mask_styles/Images/Boulsa/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125173952/http://www.uiowa.edu/~africart/Mask_styles/Images/Boulsa/index.htm |archivedate=2009-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; masks have tall posts above the face to which fiber is attached.

Female masks have two pairs of round mirrors for eyes; small masks, representing Yali, "the child," have two vertical horns. All Nyonyose masks are worn with thick costumes made of the fiber of the wild hemp, Hibiscus cannabinus, In the old days only the northern Nyonyose in Yatenga and Kaya, and the eastern people around Boulsa allowed their masks to be photographed. The people in the southwest forbade photography because it did not conform to the ''yaaba soore'', the path of the ancestors.

Mask characters include Balinga, the Fulani woman; katre, the hyena; nyaka, the small antelope; Wan pelega, the large antelope, and many others. Masks from all three areas appear at annual public [[festivals]] such as [[SIAO]] ([[French language|Fr.]] ''Salon international de l’Artisanat de Ouagadougou''), [[Week of the Culture]], and the [[Atypical Nights of Koudougou]] (''Les Nuits Atypiques de Koudougou''). Each Nyonyose family has its own mask, and they are charged with protecting the masks to this day. Masks are very sacred and are a link to the spirits of ancestors and of nature.

'''Manipuri Muslims''' or '''Pangals''' are [[Islam|Muslims]] who live in [[Manipur]], in [[North East India]]. According to the most accepted view, there have been adherents to Islam in Manipur since at least the first decade of the 17th Century. In the 2001 Indian census, Muslims constituted about 8.32 percent of the total population of Manipur; 190,939 persons.&lt;ref&gt;''Government of India, Manipur, Census, 2010''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other Manipuris, such as the [[Naga people|Naga]] and [[Kuki people|Kuki]], are more often [[Christians]].  
Most Manipuri Muslims, identify as '''[[Pangal]]''' (also ''Pangahl'' or ''Pangan'') – a Muslim subgroup of the [[Meitei people|Meitei]] (or ''Meetei'') ethnicity. Hence they are also known as '''Meitei-Pangals''' and '''Miah Meitei'''.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. N. Debendra Singh, 2005, ''Identities of the Migrated People of Manipur'', Canchipur: Centre for Manipuri Studies (Manipur University).&lt;/ref&gt; The Pangals usually reside in valley communities, whereas adherents to other religions tend to be hill-dwellers. Meitei-Pangals live not only in Manipur, but also in [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Nagaland]] and across the national border in [[Bangladesh]].  Significant expatriate communities live in [[Saudi Arabia]], the UK and the United States.

==History==

===Exile of Shah Shuja===
While some Muslims were already living in Manipur, there was a significant influx of Muslims from 1660 onwards, as refugees followed the deposing of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] (Shangkusum) of [[Hindustan]], who lost a war of succession to [[Aurangzeb]]. Shuja's flight is significant in the Islamic folklore of both north east India and [[Bangladesh]].

On 6 June 1660, Shuja fled from [[Dacca]] (Dhaka), initially intent on travelling, via [[Chittagong]] to [[Kingdom of Arakan|Arakan]] (Rakhine).&lt;ref name="Manucci"&gt;Niccolai Manucci, ''Storia do Mogor or History of Mughal India'', translator [[William Irvine (historian)|William Irvine]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suhas Chatterjee, 2008, ''The Socio-Economic History of South Assam''.&lt;/ref&gt; Arakan, capital of the [[Mrauk U Kingdom]], was the destination, because [[Sanda Thudamma|Sanda Sudamma]] (Thudamma) had reportedly promised to provide ships to take Shuja and his entourage to [[Mecca]] for [[haj]] (pilgrimage). Shaju travelled with  his wife [[Piari Banu Begum]] (a.k.a. Praveen Banu, Piara Banu, or Pai Ribanu) and her sister [[Sabe Banu]], his sons [[Zainul Abidin]] (Zainibuddin, Bon Sultan or Sultan Bang), [[Buland Akhtar]] and [[Zain-ul-Din Muhammad]] (Zainul Abedi), and daughters [[Gulrukh Banu]], [[Roshanara Begum]] and [[Amina Begum]],&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Lane-Pool, 1971, ''Aurangzeb'', vol.1.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as two vessels of gold and silver, jewels, treasures and other royal trappings, on the backs of half a dozen camels, while about 1,000 [[palanquin]]s (carriers) transported Shuja's [[harem]]. After staying for some time at Chittagong, Shuja took a land route (still called Shuja Road) southward. Shuja prayed the [[Eid prayer]] at a place called Edgoung (meaning [[eidgah]]) in [[Dulahazra]]. The part crossed the [[Naf River]], half a mile north of [[Maungdaw]], which is sometimes still known as "Shuja Village". The final leg was a sea voyage to Arakan  where Shuja was received by an envoy of king Sanda Sudamma and escorted to quarters provided for him.  However, after Shuja arrived in Arakan, Sudama reportedly reneged on this promise and confiscated some of Shuja's treasure. In retaliation, Zainul Abidin and another brother led a Mughal attack on Sudama and almost succeeded in setting fire to the royal palace. Two or three of Shuja's sons died in subsequent fighting and/or the Mughals' flight into the jungle. Many other Mughals were massacred.  Shuja's daughter Gulrukh reportedly committed suicide after being captured and raped by Sudama. The surviving members of Shaju's party, helped reportedly by Mughals and [[Pathan]]s resident at Arakan,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Niccolai Manucci, ''Storia do Mogor''.&lt;/ref&gt; travelled north with [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] mariners, at a high cost in gold and jewels.

The [[Hindu]] kings of Tripura and Manipur were more agreeable hosts – probably because they did not like the expansionist policy of Aurangzeb – and played a crucial role in concealing Shuja's whereabouts. He and his party arrived at Tripura on 16 May 1661,&lt;ref name="Manucci"/&gt; and in Manipur in December 1661.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cheitharol Kumbaba]]'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Conscious that Aurangzeb’s scouts and spies were searching for them,&lt;ref&gt;Janab Khan, 1972, ''Manipuri Muslim'' also locally called "Moughlai Muslim".&lt;/ref&gt; misinformation was spread that Shuja had died at Arakan, or was travelling to Mecca, among other stories.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Among other precautionary measures, Shuja was sent by elephant to the hill country of [[Ukhrul]].&lt;ref&gt;see also ''How Shuja, Brother of Aurangzeb died (sic) at Ukhrul''; he actually died and was buried at Kairang Shujalok.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mir Jumla II]] came to know of the situation and sent three men to Manipur in late December 1661, to detain and retrieve Shuja's family.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hakim Shah, 2008, ''The Manipur Governance''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Qazi]] of Manipur, [[Muhammad Sani]], detained the chief emissary of the Mughals, [[Nur Beg]] to ensure that the others, [[Dur Beg]] and [[Rustam Beg]], did not provide information regarding Shuja’s presence in Manipur.&lt;ref&gt;Names of Mughal ambassadors can be known from P. Gogoi, 1961, ''The Tai and Tai Kingdoms'' who gave Dur Beg and Rustam; Kheiruddin Khullakpam, 1997, ''Turko-Afghangi Chada Naoda'', Lilong: Circles, gives the Boggy clan ancestor as Noor Bakhsh that must be Noor Beg.&lt;/ref&gt;  At that time, Shuja was in hiding at a cave known later as [[Shuja-lok]] ("Shuja Cave"),&lt;ref&gt;Janab Khan, 1972, ''Manipuri Muslim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Haignang]], [[Kairang]] (east of [[Imphal]]). According to some accounts he later died at the cave.

A '''nuisance fee''' is a [[fee]], [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], or [[Sanctions (law)|penalty]] which is [[Security interest|charged]] to deter an action, rather than to compensate for the costs of that action.  For example, a five-dollar penalty for submitting an application late does not compensate for costs associated with processing late submissions, but rather encourages people to submit on time.

'''Olivier Bernard''', known as the Pharmafist (Le Pharmachien), is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[Science communication|science communicator]] who uses [[cartoon]]s to counter [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-scientific]] myths. He writes the Pharmafist blog, the Pharmachien books and produces the television program ''Les aventures du pharmachien'', denouncing ineffective or dangerous treatments.

== Biography ==
Bernard started working as a [[pharmacist]] upon receiving his diploma in 2004 ([[Université Laval]], [[Quebec City]]). He subsequently completed, in 2006, a master's degree in pharmacogenetics and worked in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name=innov/&gt;&lt;ref name=aboutme/&gt;

Disillusioned by the industry's business practices, Bernard quit in 2013.&lt;ref name=erreur/&gt;&lt;ref name=innov/&gt; He still works as a part-time pharmacist as he makes a name for himself as a scientific communicator, writes books, produces a television program and gives conferences.&lt;ref name=aboutme/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"There was a constant conflict between the commercial side and pharmaceutics." - Olivier Barnard, The Pharmafist&lt;ref name=urbaine/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He's been sharing his comments on medicine and pseudoscience on lepharmachien.com (in French) since 2012&lt;ref name=innov/&gt; and in English on theharmafist.com, since 2016.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Bernard uses a colourful style, described by emergency physician [[Alain Vadeboncoeur]] as "friendly, but confident, perhaps a little of a smart-ass", but "he does not attack people, only practices, ideas and concepts."&lt;ref name=vade/&gt; As a science communicator, Bernard says he's influenced by Vadeboncoeur, as well as astrophysicists [[Hubert Reeves]] and [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]].&lt;ref name=urbania/&gt;

==Web activity==
Through his website, the Pharmafist aims to "destroy scientific myths and health beliefs and (...) encourages people to develop critical thinking and to make better choices about vaccines, gluten, nutritional complements, sugar or useless cold medicines."&lt;ref name=TLMP/&gt;

In 2017, his French Facebook page had 144,000 subscribers. The lepharmachien.com website logged 350,000 visits per month.&lt;ref name=contact/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One question I often ask myself is: Just how much must I make the content accessible? (...) Reaching a good balance between a short, punchy text and rigorous content is always a challenge." - Olivier Bernard, the Pharmafist&lt;ref name=reflet/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bernard is identified as host and content producer of the program for DATSIT Studios.&lt;ref name=explora/&gt;

In the program, Bernard experiments on himself with many treatments he denounces as being ineffective: natural sunscreen, [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]] solutions, products meant to change the acidity of one's urine.&lt;ref name=TLMP/&gt;

The initial broadcast of the first episode was seen by a total of 363,000 people on Radio-Canada's various platforms. A second broadcast two days later attracted 43,000 more.&lt;ref name=metro/&gt;

The '''Parti Acadien''' was a [[political party]] in [[New Brunswick]], Canada, in the 1970s and 1980s. The party was founded in 1972 by [[Acadian]]s who were upset over poorer living conditions in predominantly [[francophone]] areas of the province versus those areas dominated by [[English Canadian|anglophones]].  The economy of New Brunswick was concentrated in the cities of [[Fredericton, New Brunswick|Fredericton]], [[Saint John, New Brunswick|Saint John]] and [[Moncton]], while the eastern and northern parts of New Brunswick, predominantly Francophone, was relatively poorer as a result of an economy based primarily on entrenched and seasonal [[commercial fishing]] and [[lumber]] industries.

[[File:Acadie prospective.png|thumb|left|Approximate map of an Acadian province. In light blue, the areas of New Brunswick with a significant proportion of Francophones. In dark blue, the areas with a Francophone majority.]]
Despite efforts by [[Louis Robichaud]], an Acadian who served as the province's [[Premier (Canada)|premier]] between the [[New Brunswick general election, 1960|1960]] and [[New Brunswick general election, 1970|1970 elections]], to modernize through investment in education and business promotion by instituting what was called an [[equal opportunity]] program, some Acadians felt they would be better served by their own administration.  As a result, the Parti Acadien advocated the formation of a separate Acadian province within Canada, a proposition that would require an amendment to the [[Canadian Constitution]] following a provincial referendum.

The Parti Acadien tried to distance itself from its more radical elements, even hesitating to use the word "nationalist". Their platform had several socialist policies, though officially their goal was to work for reforms using the already-existing framework of New Brunswick law. They also explained that they were not anti-[[English Canadian|anglophone]] ''per se'', but felt that the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system in place in the province favoured the predominantly English south. Many of the radicals joined a new cultural organization, the [[Société Acadienne du Nouveau-Brunswick]] (SANB).

[[Euclide Chiasson]] was the party's first president and leader. The party nominated 13 candidates in the province's 58 ridings in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1974|1974 provincial election]], 23 candidates in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1978|1978 provincial election]], and 10 candidates in the [[New Brunswick general election, 1982|1982 provincial election]], which was the party's last.

The party considered an alliance or merger with the [[New Brunswick New Democratic Party]] (NDP), encouraging voters in ridings with no Parti Acadien candidate to vote for the NDP instead. No formal agreement was ever reached.

In 1975, [[Jean-Pierre Lanteigne]] was elected leader. He sought to abandon demands for a new Acadian province, instead maintaining a social democratic agenda for New Brunswick as a whole. This caused a rift in the party, with some members hoping that the success of the [[Quebec separatist|separatist]] [[Parti Québécois]] in the Province of [[Quebec]] would spark hopes for Acadian nationalism as well. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Lanteigne insisted, however, that his party was not a New Brunswick branch of the Parti Québécois.

==1978 provincial election==
The Parti Acadien decided once again to support the creation of a separate province, in tandem with most (but not all) SANB members. The party went into the [[New Brunswick general election, 1978|1978 election]] with a platform of independence. However, [[Richard Hatfield]] and the governing [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservatives]] also promoted a platform that promised to increase the role of the Acadian people and culture within the province.

The party's platform was seen as vague during the election, so it subsequently clarified its positions. The party stood for in decentralization of provincial powers and French-language administrative units across the province. A convention of Parti Acadien supporters, SANB members and other Acadians in 1979 produced a split on the issue of whether to vote to secede from New Brunswick or work for reform from within. The SANB (still a cultural association at the core) risked having its funding from the [[Government of Canada]] cut off before it explained that the convention produced no consensus and was not binding.

The 1978 election was the Parti Acadien's most successful. Their candidates averaged 12% of the vote, and [[Restigouche West]] candidate Armand Plourde finished second, only 170 votes short of first place. This was the party's only second-place finish, and the closest it came to winning a seat. In the election the [[New Brunswick Liberal Association|Liberal Party]] led by Acadian [[Joseph Daigle (New Brunswick politician)|Joseph Daigle]] garnered 44.36% of the popular vote, just .03%  less than the winning Progressive Conservatives and captured twenty-eight seats to the Conservative Party's thirty. The votes that went to the Parti Acadien traditionally had gone to the Liberals and it was widely believed that the Parti acadien cost the Liberals the election.

In 1980, the majority of the SANB membership votes in favour of promoting secession. As a result, it lost funding from both the federal and provincial governments, who feared that radicals had taken over the group (and by extension, the Parti Acadien). The more centrist factions of the party jumped ship, mostly to the Conservatives. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

By the [[New Brunswick general election, 1982|1982 election]], the Conservatives' policies on francophone rights resonated with Acadian voters, and Hatfield's party won an unprecedented number of Acadian seats. Hatfield's overtures to the Acadians did not sit well with many anglophone New Brunswickers, who later founded the [[New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party]] whose platform called for English as the only official language in New Brunswick. The Parti Acadien lost 75% of its support from 1978, and officially disbanded in 1986.

==History==
The exact number of [[prostitute]]s working in [[Iran]] is unknown. However, prostitutes are visible on some street corners of the [[List of cities in Iran|major cities]]. Many of them are runaways from poor and broken homes.&lt;ref name="economist1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/2137652 |title=Shorn of dignity and equality |publisher=The Economist |date=2003-10-16 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2000"&gt;{{cite news|title= Drugs and prostitution 'soar' in Iran|publisher= BBC|date=2000-07-06|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/822312.stm|accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the moderate Iranian newspaper ''[[Entekhab]]'' estimated that there were close to 85,000 prostitutes in [[Tehran]] alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lapidos |first=Juliet |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2189816/ |title=How to Spot a Persian Prostitute |publisher=Slate |date=2008-04-23 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prostitution is rampant in Tehran; "the streets are full of working girls ... part of the landscape, blending in with everything else."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/30/inside-modern-iran-where-porn-and-prostitution-are-rampant/|title=Inside modern Iran, where porn and prostitution are rampant|date=August 30, 2014|newspaper=New York Post|author=Larry Getlan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police raids have also exposed child prostitution rings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranfocus.com/en/?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=1840 |title=Iran in focus |publisher=Iran Focus |date=2005-04-11 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
An Iranian psychiatrist, Mahdis Kamkar, believes  the rise in prostitution is a symptom of broader social problems, among them "troubled families, divorce, identity crises and social contradictions." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebody.com/content/world/art17937.html |title=Rise in Iranian Prostitution Blamed on Strict Sex Rules, Economy |publisher=The Body |date= 2002-09-16 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Iranian Revolution in 1979, prostitutes were confined to separate neighborhoods such as [[Shahr-e No]] in Tehran. The new religious government demolished the district and punished  prostitution with lashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Fath | first = Nazila | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/28/world/to-regulate-prostitution-iran-ponders-brothels.html |title=To Regulate Prostitution, Iran Ponders Brothels |publisher=New York Times |date=2002-08-28 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing brothels is also a criminal act, subject to 1–10 years imprisonment, if not subject to death sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ZAHARIE|first1=Cristian Giuseppe|title=THE LEGAL REGIME OF PROSTITUTION ON THE MUSLIM COUNTRIES|url=ftp://ftp.repec.org/opt/ReDIF/RePEc/rau/clieui/SP14/CLI-SP14-A5.pdf|publisher=Romanian-American University|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution scandal==
In 2008, General [[Reza Zarei]], the Tehran police chief, was arrested in a brothel with six prostitutes.&lt;ref name=Spiegel2008&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,550156,00.html |title=Prostitute Scandal Rattles Tehran Government |date=April 28, 2008 |work=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His arrest caused embarrassment for the government of [[President Ahmadinejad]]  because Zarei was in charge of [[Vice#Law enforcement|vice]] in Tehran.&lt;ref name=Spiegel2008/&gt; The prosecutor in the case remarked that Zarei exploited his office to profit materially from prostitution.&lt;ref name=Spiegel2008/&gt;

== Nikah mut‘ah or Sigheh ==
{{Main article|Nikah mut‘ah}}
{{see also| Women in Iran}}
While prostitution is illegal in Iran, the Shiah institution of [[Nikah mut‘ah]] (temporary marriage, usually called ''Sigheh'' in Iran) allows contractual short-term relations between both sexes. Usually, a [[dowry]] is given to the temporary wife. Sigheh can last from 3days to 99 years (although some Islamic scholars (mujtahids), say that it is impossible to marry a person, as temporary marriage, for a period of time that is usually longer than the average life-time of a person);&lt;ref&gt;''Resaaleye Daneshjouyi; Porsesh-ha va Pasokh-ha''.

According to a number of scholars and [[Persian people|Iranians]], Sigheh is being misused as a legal cover for prostitution in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Andreeva, Elena (2007). Russia and Iran in the great game: travelogues and Orientalism. Routledge studies in Middle Eastern history. 8. Psychology Press. pp. 162–163. {{ISBN|0415771536}}. "Most of the travelers describe the Shi'i institution of temporary marriage (sigheh) as 'legalized profligacy' and hardly distinguish between temporary marriage and prostitution."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haeri, Shahla (1989). Law of Desire: Temporary Marriage in Shi'i Iran. Contemporary Issues in the Middle East. ''Syracuse University Press''. p. x. {{ISBN|0815624832}}. "Outside of the religious establishment and the ongoing disputes between Shi'i and Sunni scholars, the attitude toward temporary marriage has been primarily one of ambivalence and disdain. Before the revolution of 1979, the secular Iranian middle classes dismissed temporary marriage as a form of prostitution that had been legitimized by the religious establishment, who, to use a popular Persian expression, 'put a religious hat on it.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Religious people argue that Islamic temporary marriage is different from prostitution for a couple of reasons, including the necessity of [[iddah]] in case the couple have sexual intercourse. It means that if a woman marries a man in this way and has sex, she has to wait for a certain period of time before marrying again and therefore, a woman cannot marry more than a limited number of times in a year. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/temporary-marriage-islam-part-6-similarities-and Temporary Marriage in Islam Part 6: Similarities and Differences of Mut’a and Regular Marriage | A Shi'ite Encyclopedia | Books on Islam and Muslims | Al-Islam.org].

== Special Healthcare and Screening Centers ==
On July 15, 2016, [[Ali Akbar Sayyari]], the healthcare affairs' Deputy Minister of the [[Ministry of Health and Medical Education]] of Iran, informed the public about improving and/or establishing (depending on the area and place in the country) 'drop-in centers' and '[[voluntary counseling and testing]]' centers for the female sex workers. These centers provide disease prevention tools and examine the sex workers for [[Sexually transmitted disease|STDs]]. They also provide counselling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irinn.ir/news/166906/%d8%a7%db%8c%d8%ac%d8%a7%d8%af-%d9%85%d8%b1%d8%a7%da%a9%d8%b2-%d8%a8%d9%87%d8%af%d8%a7%d8%b4%d8%aa%db%8c-%d8%a8%d8%b1%d8%a7%db%8c-%d8%b2%d9%86%d8%a7%d9%86-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%be%db%8c ایجاد مراکز بهداشتی برای زنان روسپی].

== 2016 Estimation ==
According to Farahnaz Salimi, head of Aaftaab Society, an NGO for social damages controlling and prevention, there are about 10,000 female sex workers in Tehran. Among these sex workers, there are married women or female clerks, too. According to her reports, the average price of having sex with sex workers is 600,000 rials (60,000 tomans which is about 14.28 USD). The price can be as high as some hundred thousand tomans (= some million rials) for a night. The lowest price is 50,000 rials (= 5,000 tomans).&lt;ref&gt;[http://aftabnews.ir/fa/news/374016/%DB%B1%DB%B0-%D9%87%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%86-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B4-%D8%AF%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D9%85%D8%AA%D8%A3%D9%87%D9%84-%D8%AA%D8%A7-%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B7-%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%B1%D9%88%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C ۱۰ هزار «تن فروش» در تهران از متأهل تا کارمند/ارتباط جنسی برای عبور از بوروکراسی اداری].

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Iran}}
Iran is a source, transit, and destination country for men, women, and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Organized groups reportedly subject Iranian women, boys, and girls to sex trafficking in Iran, [[Afghanistan]], the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraqi Kurdistan Region]] (IKR), [[Pakistan]], [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE), and [[Europe]]. Some Iranian women, who seek employment to support their families in Iran, are vulnerable to sex trafficking. Iranian girls between the ages of 13 and 17 are targeted by traffickers for sale abroad; younger girls may be forced into domestic service until their traffickers consider them old enough to be subjected to [[child sex trafficking]]. In 2016, there was a reported increase in young Iranian women in prostitution in [[Dubai]]; some of these women may be trafficking victims. From 2009-2015, the transport of girls from and through Iran en route to other [[Persian Gulf]] states for sexual exploitation reportedly increased. Iranian girls were subjected to sex trafficking in brothels in the IKR, especially [[Sulaimaniya]]; in some cases this exploitation was facilitated by Iranian trafficking networks. In 2015, the media reported [[Kurdistan Regional Government]] officials were among the clients of these brothels. In Tehran, [[Tabriz]], and [[Astara, Iran|Astara]], the number of teenage girls exploited in sex trafficking reportedly continues to increase. Afghan migrants and refugees, including children, are highly vulnerable to sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web |title=Iran 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report |url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271207.htm |website=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=24 June 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[United States State Department]] placed Iran as a "[[Trafficking in Persons Report#Ranking System|Tier 2]]" in its annual [[human trafficking|Trafficking]] in Persons reports, stating that "it does not fully comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2004/33195.htm |title= Trafficking in Persons Report |date=2009-02-25 |website=Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] downgraded Iran to "Tier 3", noting that the country makes no significant effort to solve trafficking problems, mainly in relation to prostitution and forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2010/142759.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report 2010 |author=Bureau of Democracy Human Rights and Labor |year=2010 |website= |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[politics]], a '''red–red–green coalition''' or '''red–green–red coalition''' is a [[left-wing]] alliance of two "red" [[social democratic]], [[democratic socialist]] or [[socialist]] parties with one "[[Green politics|green]]" [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] party.

== Germany ==
In [[Politics of Germany|Germany]], many SPD politicians are averse to cooperation with [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]. The first such coalition was formed after [[Thuringian state election, 2014|Thuringian state election]] in 2014 under leadership of [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]].

== Sweden ==
In [[Politics of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Red-green alliance (Sweden)|red-red-green alliance]] refer to the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democratic Party]], [[Green Party (Sweden)|Green Party]] and [[Left Party (Sweden)|Left Party]].

'''Romani people in Kosovo''' living usually in "Mahalas" (segregated settlement) are part of the biggest minority in Europe. Important to mention is that although Ashkali and Egyptians have very similar culture, tradition, non distinguishing physical appearance, most of them do not want to be put together as one minority but as minorities. Mainly there are historical differences claimed. Roma speak Roma language in most cases, but also the languages that surround them, such as Serbian and Albanian. Many Romani were targeted by [[Kosovo Albanians]] ([[Kosovo Liberation Army]]) with the Serbs during the [[Kosovo War]] as being considered to be allied with Serbs and Serbian national interests. 

Romani in [[Kosovo]] are much depleted from their former numbers, and have been in both stationary and nomadic residence there since the 15th century. 

[[Kosovo Liberation Army]] ([[Kosovo Albanians]]) expelled 50,000 Romani from Kosovo, forcing them to take refuge in central Serbia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cafod.org.uk/where_we_work/eastern_europe/serbia/the_roma_community_in_serbia |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-10-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020014811/http://www.cafod.org.uk/where_we_work/eastern_europe/serbia/the_roma_community_in_serbia |archive-date=2007-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but many of them returned to Kosovo. In 2011 there were 36,694 Romani, Ashkali and Egyptians living in Kosovo,or around 2% of the population.

==Subgroups==
As in other parts of the Balkans, the denomination of Romani has always been subject to outside pressure. In the official census, the labels Romani and (Kosovo) Egyptians were used.

After the war and encouraged by the international community, the label Romani, Ashkali and Kosovo Egyptians and its abbreviation RAE became more common. Whereas the Ashkali and Kosovo Egyptians assert their distinct origin, this is sometimes contested by Kosovo Romani who claim that all three groups are actually Romani subgroups.

==Culture==
While all the three groups claim ethnic differences between them, they frequently intermarry. Romani weddings to non-Romani (Gadje, ''outsiders'') is extremely rare. Egyptians, Romani and Ashkalija however do not classify one another as [[Gadjo (non-Romani)|Gadje]].

== Discrimination==
Following the cessation of the Kosovo war in June 1999 and the subsequent return of ethnic Albanians from abroad, approximately four fifths of Kosovo's pre-1999 RAE population had been expelled from their homes.{{sfn|Cahn|2007|pp=82}} During the implementation by the Milosevic regime of “Operation Horseshoe” in Kosovo in the early months of 1999, Roma and others regarded as Gypsies were regarded as complicit in siding with the Serbs. The facts are not disputed: Roma assisted the Serbian police in plundering Albanian homes and shops to supply the military action, and in burying the Albanian dead. However, there is no common ground on the interpretation of these facts. Roma say that the forces of the state coerced them into assisting the military operation and that there was no space for resistance.{{sfn|Cahn|2007|pp=83}} Many Romanis were also recruited into the Yugoslav army to "help terrorise Albanians" and Roma homes were marked with an "R" on their doors to distinguish them from Albanian houses when the Serbian paramilitaries arrived to plunder.{{sfn|Kenrick|2007|pp=144}} 

Albanians regarded these acts as further evidence that Roma had allied themselves with the enemies of the Albanian nation, and thus many Roma were targeted by the returning Albanians.{{sfn|Cahn|2007|pp=83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC News:Kosovo gypsies under threat|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/386755.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The departure of the Yugoslav army and police was followed by a series of "retaliatory attacks". By June 1999 The Romani mahala of Mitrovica was burned down and the inhabitants fled. Around 3,500 Roma took shelter in a school in Kosovo Polje following threats and the Roma community of [[Djakovica]] were warned to leave their homes. The Romany quarter of Brekoc in Djakovica and Dusanova in [[Prizren]] were also burned down.{{sfn|Kenrick|2007|pp=145}} German KFOR troops also discovered 15 severely beaten Roma, accused of taking part in looting and collaborating with the Serbs, in a police office in Prizren that was being used by the [[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]] as a prison.{{sfn|Cahn|2007|pp=83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eyewitness: Disarming the KLA |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/372840.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 5,000 displaced Roma gathered in a KFOR built camp in [[Obilic]] where they were subject to insults and attacks by the Albanians.{{sfn|Cahn|2007|pp=83}} 

Romani in Kosovo, today live in constant fear of further ethnic unrest. Romani unhoused in North Kosovo are today housed in lead-infested camps in [[Roma in United Nations refugee camps, Kosovska Mitrovica|North Kosovska Mitrovca]].&lt;ref&gt;See also ''Viewpoint'' (Council of Europe, Commissioner for Human Rights): [http://www.coe.int/t/commissioner/viewpoints/100222_EN.asp? European migration policies discriminate against Roma people] by [[Thomas Hammarberg]], 22/02/10&lt;/ref&gt; There is ongoing campaign for rehousing and proper health provisions for the families affected, and a fatality estimate ranges from 27 to 81.

{{quotation|Today, persecution of members of these Roma communities continues, manifested in their systematic exclusion from access to fundamental human rights. Racial discrimination against RAE communities in Kosovo is pervasive, depriving tens of thousands of their dignity. Anti-Gypsy sentiment among the ethnic Albanian majority is widespread. Today, RAE and others considered Gypsies in Kosovo live in a state of pervasive fear, fostered by routine intimidation, verbal harassment, and periodic racist assaults.{{sfn|Cahn|2007|pp=83}}|German Law Journal analysis on the status of the Roma}}


== Education ==
[[Formal education]] is of a poor standard, especially among women, due both to native beliefs that formal education is unnecessary, and to discrimination in education in the formal schools who are ill-equipped for the needs of Romani children.

[[Serbianization|Serbianising]] and [[Albanization|Albanizing]] tendencies have also lead to the Romani sliding from the educational mainstream.

Third level education is not attained by the majority of Rom, and of those who do, they are mostly only half Romani, with there being Serb, Turk or Albanian heritage too.

==Kosovska Mitrovica camps==
{{Main|Roma in United Nations refugee camps, Kosovska Mitrovica}}

Returning [[Internally displaced person|IDP]]s were housed by NATO / UNMIK in [[Roma in United Nations refugee camps, Kosovska Mitrovica|North Kosovska Mitrovica]] in a lead mine site, and 27 died of lead poisoning. They were helped by NGO the KRRF, led by [[Paul Polansky]].

'''Saros''' or ''Creoles in  Nigeria'' during the nineteenth century and early twentieth century were [[freed slaves]] who migrated to [[Nigeria]] in the beginning of the 1830s. They were known locally as saros (elided form of Sierra Leone, from the [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] ''sàró'') or Amaros: migrants from Brazil and Cuba.&lt;ref name="falola"&gt;{{cite book | last = Falola | first = Toyin | title = Encyclopedia of the Yoruba | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780253021441 | pages = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saros and Amaros also settled in other West African countries such as the Gold Coast (Ghana). They were mostly freed and repatriated slaves from various [[West African]] and [[Latin American]] countries such as [[Sierra Leone]], [[Brazil]] and [[Cuba]]. Liberated "returnee" Africans from Brazil were more commonly known as "Agudas", from the word ''àgùdà'' in the Yoruba language. Most of the Latin American returnees or Amaros started migrating to Africa after slavery was abolished on the continent while others from West Africa, or the Saros were recaptured and freed slaves already resident in Sierra Leone. Many of the returnees chose to return to Nigeria for [[cultural]], [[missionary]] and economic reasons. Many (if not the greater majority) of them were originally descended from the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] of western and central Nigeria. Other  Nigerian groups forming part of the Sierra Leonean [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Krio]] population included [[Efik people|Efik]], [[Igbos]], [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and [[Nupe people|Nupe]].

The returnees mostly resided in the [[Lagos Colony]], with substantial populations in [[Abeokuta]]  and [[Ibadan]]. Some also settled in [[Calabar]], [[Port Harcourt]] and other cities in the [[Niger Delta]]. Though, many were originally dedicated [[Anglophile]]s in Nigeria, they later adopted an indigenous and patriotic attitude on Nigerian affairs due to a rise in discrimination in the 1880s,&lt;ref&gt;Lorand Matory. The English Professors of Brazil: On the Diasporic Roots of the Yoruba Nation,  Comparative Studies in Society and History, Vol. 41, No. 1, Jan., 1999. p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and were later known as cultural nationalists.

==Saros==

===Life in Sierra Leone===
[[Image:slaves sierra leone.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An 1835 illustration of liberated slaves arriving in Sierra Leone.]]
While living in Sierra Leone, many [[Sierra Leone Creole people|Creole]] residents became exposed to the Christian faith as a result of the work of British [[missionaries]] who established some Churches, a few grammar schools and a pioneer educational institution, the [[Fourah Bay College]]. Relatively, the residents of Sierra Leone soon gained a fast start in Western education and were soon well trained and experienced in [[medicine]], law, and the [[civil service]].&lt;ref name="falola"/&gt; Many of them graduated from [[grammar schools]] and became administrative workers for the British [[British Empire|imperial]] interest in the country. By the middle of the nineteenth century some of the African literati in Sierra Leone began to migrate to Nigeria, especially the colony of Lagos for economic reasons and some were administrative personnel who were reassigned to Lagos. An expedition of the [[river Niger]] by [[Ajayi Crowther]] furthered the evangelical interest of many Sierra Leoneans on Nigeria, many of whom had grown to be accessories of the missionaries and their effort.

===Life in Lagos and Abeokuta===
{{Afro-Brazilian topics sidebar}}
Lagos was a strategic and important [[fishing]] location for the original founders, the [[Awori tribe|Awori]]s. It was established as a fishing community by Awori immigrants in the sixteenth century. The town later emerged as major economic base nurtured by [[immigration]] from nearby [[ethnic]] groups led by the [[Ijebus]], then the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]]s, the [[Bini people|Bini]]s, and the [[Egba people|Egba]]s. Trade with Europeans also fueled the commercial rise of the city.&lt;ref name="Faluyi"&gt;Kehinde Faluyi. Migrants and the Economic Development of Lagos, From the Earliest of Times to 1880. p 1&lt;/ref&gt; By 1880, Lagos had already become a cosmopolitan city. Sierra Leonean immigrants started moving to Lagos in the 1840s. Many of the immigrants were of Egba and [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] heritage and some were familiar with [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traditions and culture. They assimilated fairly well with the Yorubas, and coupled with an earlier training and interaction with the British in Sierra Leone, they were able to become part of the colonial society. The returnees were generally focused on trade and rose to become commercial middlemen between residents of Lagos, Abeokuta and the British colony in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

In Lagos, the Saros chose [[Ebute Metta]], Olowogbowo, and [[Yaba, Lagos|Yaba]] as primary settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Faluyi, p 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Saros mostly of Egba heritage established a few of the oldest churches in Lagos and also expanded the missionary work of the British in Nigeria. The Saros also emerged as a dominant commercial group in Lagos. Having developed a migratory forte, they had an edge as travelers who were able to go into the interiors to meet directly with various commodity producers and traders. They were the pioneer Southern Nigerian traders in [[Kola nut|Kola]], a cash crop that later emerged as a viable and important [[export]] [[commodity]] for the Western region in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Agiri"&gt;Babatunde Agiri. The Introduction of Nitida Kola into Nigerian Agriculture, 1880-1920, African Economic History, No. 3,  Spring, 1977. p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Saros introduced the crop which was bought from Hausa traders across the River Niger into Southern Nigeria agriculture. The first Kola farm and the dominant trader in Kola, [[Mohammed Shitta Bey]], were orchestrated by Saros. They also did not drop their yearning for western education as they dominated the ranks of professions open to Africans. They were lawyers, doctors, and civil servants.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Skirmishes in western Nigeria===
Early on, the Saros who had acquired Western education and European cultural mores during their time in Sierra Leone, began to show paternal characteristics in their relationship with native residents of Lagos. The perceived disrespect extended to some Lagos citizens led to the Saros being expelled from Lagos in the 1850s, although they soon returned. In 1867, another conflict emerged, this time it was in [[Abeokuta]]. The conflict was between the Egbas and the Europeans. The Egbas were protesting the increasing influence of western culture and a land encroachment led by the Lagos governor, Glover. Egbas decided to go on rampage and damaged European symbols such as churches and missions, a few Saros were also expelled from Egbaland, but like the case of Lagos, calm was quickly restored. Prior to the conflict, a few notable Saros, such as [[Henry Townsend (missionary)|Henry Townsend]] played prominent roles as advisers to the council of chiefs in Abeokuta.

===Life in the delta===
The Niger delta was a little bit dissimilar to Lagos and western Nigeria where the Yorubas were dominant. Lagos was much more [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] while the delta was composed of different and varied ethnic groups of equal political footing. There were also few historical attributes that would foster cultural assimilation.&lt;ref name="Dixon-Fyle"&gt;Mac Dixon-Fyle. The Saro in the Political Life of Early Port Harcourt, 1913-49, The Journal of African History, Vol. 30, No. 1. p 126.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the immigrants soon found a home in a few cities especially in the new [[city]] of [[Port Harcourt]]. Port Harcourt was founded by British authorities in 1913 as a coastal center for the export of [[Palm oil]] and [[coal]]. A number of immigrants from Yorubaland, the [[Hausa people|Hausa]] states, [[Gambia]] and Sierra Leone soon came to the city to work. Some of the Saros were [[clergymen]] and others were transferred for administrative duty. The Saros emerged in the city as pioneers of African commerce as they became suppliers to the residents of the new city. However, life in Port Harcourt was rough for many Saros. Some came to the city as workers for British merchant houses and  the colonial government. However, there was no job security afforded the immigrants in the new city. Some Saro workers were  retired without [[pension]] and suffered much financial deprivation. The retired Saros asked to return home, and some were transported back with the help of colonial funds. The lack of promotion and retirement faced by immigrant Africans was partly as a result of a systemic wall against promotion of Saros and Africans by the British. The Saros in Lagos, Port Harcourt and Abeokuta had earned the irritation of Europeans because of the achievement of a few immigrants in the clergy and business world.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Derrick. The 'Native Clerk' in Colonial West Africa, African Affairs, Vol. 82, No. 326. p 65.&lt;/ref&gt; This policy led to a gradual change among Saros especially those in the West. The [[idealistic]] revolt against the British was led in the missionary by James Johnson who decried excessive British interference in the affairs of the missionary society and who wanted more African involvement in promoting Christianity.

===Prominent Saros===
Captain [[James Pinson Labulo Davies]] and his wife, Princess [[Sara Forbes Bonetta]], were some of the most prominent Saros in Victorian Nigeria.

==Amaros==
Unlike the Saros who were principally from Sierra Leone, the Amaros, who were sometimes called ''[[Nago language|Nago]]'' in Brazil (''Nago'' indicates [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] ethnicity), were liberated slaves from Brazil and Cuba. Returnees from Brazil and Cuba and their current-day descendants were and are more commonly called "Agudas". They went to the New World as slaves from different sub-ethnic and ethnic backgrounds but approached relationships among themselves as equals. They came back to Nigeria, principally, to re-connect with their fatherland. In Lagos, their neighborhood became known as ''Popo Aguda'', Brazilian quarter. They were not brought up in the [[Anglican]] faith like the Sierra Leoneans, but [[Catholicism]], the dominant [[religion]] in Brazil and Cuba. By the 1880s, the Agudas comprised about 9% of the population of Lagos. Some of the Agudas were Muslims.  Some of the Catholic Brazilians and Cubans also worshipped the African [[Orisha]]s they had also worshipped in Brazil and Cuba. These Amaros gave [[Portuguese names|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish naming customs|Spanish names]] in Nigeria.

The Brazilian returnees were notably technically skilled [[artisan]]s and were known for the distinctive Brazilian architecture built in their settlements and later in the Lagos environs. During this time, modern [[Europe]]an architecture was not only meant to be a nice abode but also a dominating [[advertisement]] to show Africans of a different style and culture.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Vlach, The Brazilian House in Nigeria: The Emergence of a 20th-Century Vernacular House Type, The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 97, No. 383,  Jan., 1984. p 6&lt;/ref&gt; However, in due time, the Brazilian style emerged as a viable alternative and modern style used by African [[General contractor|contractor]]s working on public and large private jobs such as the Holy Cross [[Cathedral]] in Lagos and the Mohammed Shitta Bey Mosque. The Brazilians introduced to Nigeria elaborate [[architectural]] designs, two-story buildings and bungalows with stucco facades.  The Brazilian returnees also popularized the use of [[Cassava]] as a food crop.&lt;ref&gt;Faluyi p 11,12.&lt;/ref&gt; They had pioneered trade with Brazil in the mid nineteenth century. But by the 1880s, ruinous competitors and an economic downturn had forced many to abandon the export trade. [[Agriculture]] soon became an avenue to supplement shortfalls in economic activity. They also introduced cocoa plantations together with the Saro, [[James Pinson Labulo Davies|J.P.L. Davies]].

Prominent Amaros include Oloye Sir [[Adeyemo Alakija]] and Chief [[Antonio Deinde Fernandez]].

In the [[British Empire]], a '''self-governing colony''' was a [[colony]] with an elected government in which elected rulers were able to make most decisions without referring to the colonial power with nominal control of the colony. Most self-governing colonies had [[responsible government]].

Self-governing colonies for the most part have no formal authority over constitutional matters such the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|monarchy]] and the constitutional relationship with Britain. The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]], in London, serves as the ultimate avenue of appeal in matters of law and [[justice]].

Colonies have sometimes been referred to as "self-governing" in situations where the [[executive (government)|executive]] has been under the control of neither the imperial government nor a local legislature elected by [[universal suffrage]], but by a local [[oligarchy]] state. In most cases such control has been exercised by an [[social class|elite class]] from a [[settler]] community.

==History==

=== North America (1619–1949) ===
The term "self-governing colony" has sometimes been used in relation to the direct rule of a [[Crown colony]] by an [[Governor#Representing the British sovereign|executive governor]], elected under a limited franchise, such as in [[Massachusetts]] between 1630 and 1684.

The first local legislatures raised in England's colonies were the [[House of Burgesses]] of [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]] (1619) and the [[House of Assembly of Bermuda|House of Assembly]] of [[Bermuda]] (1620), originally part of Virginia. The [[Parliament of Bermuda]], which now also includes a [[Senate of Bermuda|Senate]], is the third-oldest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], after the [[Tynwald]] and Westminster (currently the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]). Of the three, only Bermuda's has legislated continuously, with the [[Royalist]] camp maintaining control of the archipelago during the [[Commonwealth of England]] and [[the Protectorate]].

However, in the modern sense of the term, the first self-governing colony is generally considered to have been the [[Province of Canada]], in 1841; the colony gained responsible government in 1849. All the colonies of [[British North America]] became self-governing between 1848 and 1855, except the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]]. [[Nova Scotia]] was the first colony to achieve [[responsible government]] in January–February 1848 through the efforts of [[Joseph Howe]], followed by the [[Province of Canada]] later that year. They were followed by [[Prince Edward Island]] in 1851, [[New Brunswick]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador#Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in 1855 under [[Philip Francis Little]]. The Canadian colonies were federated as a [[Dominion]] in 1867, except for Newfoundland, which remained a separate self-governing colony, was a separate Dominion in 1907-1934, reverted to being a crown colony in 1934, and joined Canada in 1949. However, the term "self-governing colony" is not widely used by Canadian constitutional experts.

=== Australasia (1852–1907) ===
In [[Australasia]], the term self-governing colony is widely used by historians and constitutional lawyers in relation to the political arrangements in the seven British [[settler|settler colonies]] of Australasia &amp;mdash; [[New South Wales]], [[New Zealand]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Western Australia]] &amp;mdash; between 1852 and 1901, when the six [[Australia]]n colonies agreed to [[Australian Federation|Federation]] and became a Dominion. New Zealand remained a separate colony until 1907, when it too became a Dominion.

=== Southern Africa (1852–1980) ===
In [[southern Africa]], the [[Cape Colony]] was granted representative government in 1852, followed by responsible government in 1872. [[Colony of Natal|Natal]] became self-governing in 1893, [[Transvaal Colony|Transvaal]] in 1906 and [[Orange Free State]] in 1908. These four colonies were united as a [[unitary state|unitary]] Dominion, the [[Union of South Africa]], in 1910). [[Southern Rhodesia]] (later [[Zimbabwe]]), became a self-governing colony in 1923.&lt;ref name="BrownlieBurns1979"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brownlie|first1=Ian|last2=Burns|first2=Ian R.|title=African Boundaries: A Legal and Diplomatic Encyclopaedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A8Du4k0udx4C&amp;pg=PA1306|accessdate=28 March 2017|year=1979|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=9780903983877|page=1306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe (1921–1964) ===
[[Malta Colony|Malta]] was also a self-governing colony between 1921 and 1933, 1947 and 1958, and 1962 until independence two years later.

=== Dominions/Commonwealth realms ===
The best-known examples of self-governing colonies are the [[Dominion]]s, during the mid-to-late-19th century and early 20th century. In the Dominions, prior to the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] in 1931, a [[Governor General]], officially the monarch's representative, was a ''de facto'' arm of the British government.

After the passing of the Statute of Westminster, the Dominions ceased to be considered colonies, although many colonies which did not have Dominion status were self-governing. However, after that time, the Dominions were largely free to act in matters of defence and foreign affairs, if they so chose and "Dominion" gradually acquired a new meaning: a state which was independent of Britain, but which shared the [[British monarch]] as the official head of state. The term Dominion has since largely fallen out of use and been replaced with the term [[Commonwealth realm|Realm]].

=== Modern times (1981–present) ===
In 1981, under the [[British Nationality Act 1981]] and reflecting the change in status toward devolved self-government (and depriving colonials of the rights of abode and work in the United Kingdom), self-governing and Crown colonies were renamed "British Dependent Territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1360590|title=British Nationality Act 1981|publisher=The UK Statute Law Database|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology caused offence to both loyalists and nationalists in the territories and was changed in 2002, by the means of the [[British Overseas Territories Act 2002]], to [[British Overseas Territory|British Overseas Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/Acts/acts2002/ukpga_20020008_en_1|title=British Overseas Territories Act 2002|publisher=Office of Public Sector Information|accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sibling rivalry''' is a type of [[competition]] or animosity among siblings, whether blood related or not.

Siblings generally spend more time together during childhood than they do with parents. The sibling bond is often complicated and is influenced by factors such as [[Parenting|parental]] treatment, [[birth order]], personality, and people and experiences outside the family.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jane Mersky Leder|title=Adult Sibling Rivalry|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/articles/199301/adult-sibling-rivalry|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=January 1, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sibling rivalry is particularly intense when children are very close in age and of the same gender and/or where one or both children are [[Intellectual giftedness|intellectually gifted]].&lt;ref name="sylviarimm"&gt;[http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html The Effects of Sibling Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701155521/http://www.sylviarimm.com/article13.html |date=2007-07-01 }} Syliva B. Rimm, Educational Assessment Service, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Throughout the lifespan==
[[Image:MDRBobMomSmall.jpg|thumb|right|200px|From a young age, children are sensitive to differences in parental treatment.]]

According to observational studies by [[Judith Dunn]], children are sensitive from the age of one year to differences in parental treatment. From 18 months on siblings can understand family rules and know how to comfort and be kind to each other. By the age of 3, children have a sophisticated grasp of social rules, can evaluate themselves in relation to their siblings, and know how to adapt to circumstances within the family.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt;

Sibling rivalry often continues throughout childhood and can be very frustrating and stressful to parents.&lt;ref name="michigan"&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/sibriv.htm Sibling Rivalry] University of Michigan Health System, June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Adolescents fight for the same reasons younger children fight, but they are better equipped to physically, intellectually, and emotionally hurt and be intellectually and emotionally hurt by each other. Physical and emotional changes cause pressures in the teenage years, as do changing relationships with parents and friends. Fighting with siblings as a way to get parental attention may increase in adolescence.&lt;ref name="teenagers"&gt;[http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm Living With Your Teenager: Dealing With Sibling Rivalry] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725054814/http://www.ext.nodak.edu/extnews/pipeline/teen-6w.htm |date=2011-07-25 }} Donna Rae Jacobson, North Dakota State University, July 1995&lt;/ref&gt; One study found that the age group 10 to 15 reported the highest level of competition between siblings.&lt;ref name="mcnerney"&gt;[http://jrscience.wcp.muohio.edu/humannature01/FinalArticles/SiblingRivalryinDegreeand.html Sibling Rivalry in Degree and Dimensions Across the Lifespan] Annie McNerney and Joy Usner, 30 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sibling rivalry can continue into adulthood, and sibling relationships can change dramatically over the years. Events such as a parent’s illness may bring siblings closer together, whereas marriage may drive them apart, particularly if the in-law relationship is strained. Approximately one-third of adults describe their relationship with siblings as rivalrous or distant. However, rivalry often lessens over time. At least 80 percent of siblings over age 60 enjoy close ties.&lt;ref name="psychtoday"/&gt;

==Causes==

According to Kyla Boyse from the [[University of Michigan]], each child in a family competes to define who it is as an individual and wants to show that it is separate from its siblings.  Children may feel they are getting unequal amounts of their parents’ attention, discipline, and responsiveness. Children fight most in families where there is neither any understanding that fighting is not an acceptable way to resolve conflicts nor any alternative way of handling such conflicts; in families in which physical fighting is forbidden but no method of non-physical conflict resolution (''e.g.'', verbal argument) is permitted, the conversion and accumulation of everyday disputes into long-simmering hostilities can have an effect nearly as corrosive.  Stress in the parents’ and children’s lives can create more conflict and increase sibling rivalry.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt;

===Other psychological approaches===

[[Alfred Adler]] saw siblings as "striving for significance" within the family and felt that [[birth order]] was an important aspect of personality development. In fact, psychologists and researchers today endorse the influence of birth order, as well as age and gender constellations, on sibling relationships. However, parents are seen as capable of having an important influence on whether they are competitive or not.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/FrustAgg/levy.htm The Hostile Act] David M. Levy (1941) First published in Psychological Review, 48, 356-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

David Levy introduced the term "sibling rivalry" in 1941, claiming that for an older sibling "the aggressive response to the new baby is so typical that it is safe to say it is a common feature of family life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/laurie-kramer-interview/sibling-relationships/44340.aspx Interview with Laurie Kramer] G. Stepp (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers today generally endorse this view, noting that parents can ameliorate this response by being vigilant to favoritism and by taking appropriate preventative steps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/surviving-your-childs-adolescence/201103/adolescence-and-parental-favoritism.aspx Adolescence and parental favoritism] Carl Pickhardt (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, say researchers, the ideal time to lay the groundwork for a lifetime of supportive relationships between siblings is during the months prior to the new baby's arrival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/yourchild/topics/newbaby.htm Helping Your Older Child Adjust to a New Baby Sibling] University of Michigan Health System (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Parents can reduce the opportunity for rivalry by refusing to compare or typecast their children,&lt;ref name="Journal article"&gt;[http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/parenting-issues/family-favoritism/43568.aspx Parenting Issues: Playing Favorites] Stepp, G. (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; planning fun family activities together, and making sure each child has enough time and space of their own.&lt;ref name="michigan"/&gt; They can also give each child individual attention, encourage teamwork, refuse to hold up one child (such as the oldest) as a role model for the others (such as the younger children), and avoid favoritism.&lt;ref name="arkansas"&gt;[http://www.parenting-ed.org Center for Effective Parenting] Arkansas State Parent Information &amp; Resource Center&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching the children positive ways to ask for attention from parents when they need it can also make it less likely that they will resort to aggressive attention-getting strategies. [[Eileen Kennedy-Moore]] notes that this remedy also requires that parents "catch children being good" by responding to children's kind, helpful, and creative bids for attention.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Moore, E. &amp; Katayama, M. (2005). ''What About Me? 12 Ways to Get Your Parents' Attention Without Hitting Your Sister''. Seattle, WA: Parenting Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, by being proactive about teaching children [[emotional intelligence]], problem solving skills, negotiation skills and encouraging them to look for win-win solutions, parents can help children resolve conflicts that arise as a normal part of growing up together in the same household. A concerted effort by parents to reduce competitiveness while nurturing bonding can further help alleviate sibling rivalry.

However, according to Sylvia Rimm,  although sibling rivalry can be reduced it is unlikely to be entirely eliminated. In moderate doses, rivalry may be a healthy indication that each child is assertive enough to express his or her differences with other siblings.&lt;ref name="sylviarimm"/&gt;

Weihe&lt;ref&gt;Wiehe, V. R. (1997) Sibling abuse: Hidden physical, emotional, and sexual trauma, 2nd edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that four criteria should be used to determine if questioned and/or questionable behavior is rivalry or [[sibling abuse]]. First, given that children use different conflict-resolution tactics during various developmental stages, one must rule out the possibility that the questioned behavior is in fact age-appropriate for the child exhibiting it.  Second, one must determine whether the behavior is an isolated incident or instead part of an enduring pattern: abuse is, by definition, a long-term pattern rather than occasional disagreements.  Third, one must determine if there is an "aspect of victimization" to the behavior:  rivalry tends to be incident-specific, reciprocal, and obvious to others, while abuse is characterized by secrecy and an imbalance of power. Fourth, one must determine the goal of the questioned and/or questionable behavior:  while rivalry is motivated entirely or primarily by aspects of a child's self-interest in which [[wikt:disinterest|the interests of others, including the child's rival, do not play a role]], in scenarios featuring abuse the perpetrator's ultimate interests tend to include domination, humiliation, or at least embarrassment of the victim.

==Animals==
{{main|Sibling rivalry (animals)}}
Sibling rivalry is common among various animal species, in the form of competition for food and parental attention. An extreme type of sibling rivalry occurs when young animals kill their siblings. For example, a [[black eagle]] mother lays two eggs, and the first-hatched chick pecks the younger one to death within the first few days. In the [[blue-footed booby]], there is always the emergence of a brood hierarchy. The dominant chick will attack the subordinate one in times of food scarcity, often pecking it repeatedly or driving it from the nest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drummond |first1=Hugh|last2=Chavelas |first2=Cecilia Garcia |title=Food Shortage Influences Sibling Aggression in the Blue-footed Booby |journal=Animal Behaviour |year=1989 |volume=37 |pages=806–819 |doi=10.1016/0003-3472(89)90065-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among [[spotted hyena]]s, sibling competition begins as soon as the second pup is born, and 25% of pups are killed by their siblings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sulloway.org/Holcomb.pdf Birth Order, Sibling Competition, and Human Behavior] Frank J Sulloway&lt;/ref&gt; (see: [[Siblicide]])

Sibling relationships in animals are not always competitive. For example, among [[wolves]], older siblings help to feed and guard the young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0501/0501_feature.html Mothers and Others] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060324181241/http://www.naturalhistorymag.com/0501/0501_feature.html |date=2006-03-24 }} Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, Natural History Magazine, May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous instances==

===In religion===
[[Image:Cain leadeth abel to death tissot.jpg|thumb|200px|right|''Cain leads Abel to Death'', by James Tissot.]]

The [[Book of Genesis]] in the [[Bible]] contains several examples of sibling rivalry: the story of [[Cain and Abel]] tells of one brother's jealousy after God appears to favour his sibling, and the jealousy ultimately leads to murder. [[Esau]] was jealous of his brother [[Jacob's]]   inheritance and blessing; sisters [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]] compete for the love of Jacob; [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]]'s brothers are so jealous that they effectively sell him into slavery. The following are also present in the [[Qur'an]] and the Torah.

===In literature===
A number of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays display the incidences of sibling rivalry. [[King Lear]] provokes rivalry among his three daughters by asking them to describe their love for him; in the same play, Edmund contrives to force his half-brother Edgar into exile. In ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'', sisters Kate and Bianca are shown fighting bitterly. In ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', the title character is at least partially motivated by rivalry with his brother, King Edward. In ''[[As You Like It]]'', there is obvious sibling rivalry and antagonism between Orlando and Oliver, and also between Duke Frederick and Duke Senior.

Most adaptations of [[Sherlock Holmes]] depicts sibling rivalry with his brother, [[Mycroft Holmes]].

In [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'', the brothers Cal and Aron Trask are counterparts to Cain and Abel of the Bible story.

''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' contains numerous examples, such as that between [[Stannis Baratheon]] and [[Renly Baratheon]]. After their eldest brother [[Robert Baratheon]]'s death they contend for the Iron Throne, Stannis finally killing Renly through dark magic, though it is left unclear whether he is aware of his role in Renly's death. The history of Westeros also contains "The Dance of the Dragons", in which Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen and her half-brother Aegon II Targaryen fought over the Iron Throne after their father Viserys I Targaryen's death, Aegon eventually killing Rhaenyra, but being poisoned shortly after, leading to Rhaenyra's son Aegon III becoming King.

===In film and television===
Sibling rivalry is a common theme in media that features child characters, reflecting the importance of this issue in early life. These issues can include jealousy on the birth of a new baby, different sibling roles, frequent arguments, competitiveness for mother's affection, and tensions between step-siblings.

Adult siblings can also be portrayed with a rivalrous relationship, often a continuation of childhood conflicts. [[Situation comedies]] exploit this to comic effect. Sibling relationships may be shown as alternately loving and argumentative. Brothers or sisters in a similar line of work may display professional rivalry. In serious drama, conflict between siblings can be fatal, as shown in [[crime drama]]s involving such rivalries.

===Real life===
Occasionally real life instances of sibling rivalry are publicized in the mass media. Siblings who play the same sport will often be compared with each other; for example, [[American football]] players [[Peyton Manning|Peyton]] and [[Eli Manning]], or [[tennis]] players [[Venus Williams|Venus]] and [[Serena Williams]]. Musicians [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] and [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] are portrayed as having a turbulent relationship, similar to that of [[Ray Davies|Ray]] and [[Dave Davies]] of [[The Kinks]]. Politicians [[Ed Miliband|Ed]] and [[David Miliband]] are likewise portrayed as having a strained relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Something borrowed.jpg|thumb|right|Items chosen to bring good luck to the bride. In this case, the [[veil]] was borrowed and the handkerchief was new.]]
"'''Something old'''" is the first line of a [[traditional rhyme]] that details what a [[bride]] should wear at her [[wedding]] for [[good luck]]:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Something old,
something new,
something borrowed,
something blue,
and a silver sixpence in her shoe.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The old item provided protection for the baby to come.  The item borrowed from another happy bride provided good luck.  The colour blue was a sign of [[fidelity]].  The [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpence]] &amp;mdash; a silver British coin &amp;mdash; was a symbol of [[prosperity]] or acted as a [[Spell (paranormal)|ward]] against evil done by frustrated [[suitor]]s.  The [[superstition]] is known since 1883 when it was attributed to the county of [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name=Coe/&gt;  An 1898 compilation of English folklore recounted that:

{{quote |In this country an old couplet directs that the bride shall wear:— "Something old, something new, Something borrowed, something blue."   "The something blue" takes, I am given to understand, usually the form of a [[Garter (stockings)|garter]], an article of dress which plays an important part in some wedding rites, as, for instance, in the old custom of plucking off the garter of the bride. "The something old" and "something blue" are devices to baffle the [[Evil eye|Evil Eye]]. The usual effect on the bride of the Evil Eye is to render her barren, and this is obviated by wearing "something borrowed", which should properly be the undergarment of some woman who has been blessed with children: the clothes communicate fertility to the bride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Folklore Society of Great Britain | author1-link = Joseph Jacobs | first1 = Joseph | last1 = Jacobs | author2-link = Alfred Trübner Nutt | first2 = Alfred Trübner | last2 = Nutt | first3 = Arthur Robinson | last3 = Wright | author3-link = Arthur Robinson Wright | title = Folklore | page = 128 | year = 1898}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another compilation of the era frames this poem as "a Lancashire version", as contrast against a Leicestershire recitation that "a bride on her wedding day should wear—'Something new, Something blue, Something borrowed'...", and so omits the "something old". The authors note that this counters other regional folklore warning against the wearing of [[blue]] on the wedding day, but relates the use of the color to phrases like "true blue" which make positive associations with the color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Folk-lore of women as illustrated by legendary and traditionary tales | page = 45 | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Firminger | author1-link = Thomas Firminger | first2 = Thiselton | last2 = Dyer | year = 1905}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rhyme can earlier be found in an 1876 edition of ''[[Notes and Queries]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William | last = White | title = [[Notes and Queries]] | page = 408 | year = 1876}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and is called an "ancient custom" in another 1876 book, ''Bye-gones, Relating to Wales and the Border Counties''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Bye-gones, Relating to Wales and the Border Counties | volume = 3 | page = 136 | year = 1876}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This version is referenced as well in an 1871 short story, "Marriage Superstitions, and the Miseries of a Bride Elect", in ''The St. James's Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Marriage Superstitions, and the Miseries of a Bride Elect | journal = The St. James's Magazine | volume = 28 | page = 549 | year = 1871}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The final two episodes of Season 2 of ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' are titled "[[Something Borrowed (How I Met Your Mother)|Something Borrowed]]" and "[[Something Blue (How I Met Your Mother)|Something Blue]]" in reference to the wedding occurring between the characters Marshall and Lily on the show.  The final two episodes of Season 8 of How I Met Your Mother are titled "[[Something Old]]" and "[[Something New (How I Met Your Mother) |Something New]]" in reference to the wedding occurring between the characters Barney and Robin on the show.

* In the ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' episode "[[A Dick on One Knee]]" Harry is tasked with finding something old, something new; something borrowed, and something blue, his second attempt is "Blind Joe", an old man who plays the blues that he borrowed from the Tip-Top Club. When Sally asks Harry what's new about him, Harry says Joe is his new friend. &lt;ref&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Heartwarming/ThirdRockFromTheSun&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]", the Doctor connects the four elements to his [[TARDIS]], which is "borrowed", and "brand new and ancient, and the bluest blue ever". In the same episode at [[Amy Pond]]'s wedding, she recites this saying to help remember the Doctor (excluding the line "And a silver sixpence in her shoe"), who had previously been erased from time. As she finishes her speech, wind begins blowing in the hall and several seconds later the TARDIS starts materializing right in the middle of it, and [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]—not imaginary, but flesh and blood—steps outside into the hall.

Further up the line, Mrs. Kyndley waves him down when Percy's driver asks her what's wrong, Mrs. Kyndley has forgotten the good luck package. The something old was Old Slow Coach, the something new was a [[buffer stop]] with shiny new buffers, the something borrowed was a [[flat wagon|flatbed truck]] the buffers were on, and the something blue was [[Thomas the Tank Engine|Thomas]]. The delighted bride thanks the engines and gives Percy a kiss.

* In the penultimate episode "We're Planning a June Wedding" of the popular series ''[[The Vampire Diaries]]'', lead character Caroline Forbes receives a card reading "Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue", and during the episode she receives items which signify the phrase for her wedding.

'''Southern Thai''' (Southern Thai/[[Thai language|Thai]]: {{lang|sou|ภาษาไทยถิ่นใต้}} {{IPA-th|pʰaːsǎː tʰaj tʰìn tâːj|}}), also known as '''Pak Thai''' (Southern Thai: {{lang|sou|ภาษาปักษ์ใต้}}) or '''Dambro''' ({{lang-th|ภาษาตามโพร}} {{IPA-th|pʰaːsǎː taːmpʰroː|}}), is a [[Southwestern Tai languages|Southwestern Tai]] language [[Spoken language|spoken]] in the fourteen [[Provinces of Thailand|provinces]] of [[southern Thailand]] as well as by small communities in the northernmost [[Malaysia]]n states. It is spoken by roughly five million people, and as a second language by the 1.5 million speakers of [[Kelantan-Pattani Malay|Pattani]] and other [[ethnic group]]s such as the local [[Thai Chinese]] communities, [[Negrito]]s, and other tribal groups. Most speakers are also fluent or understand the [[Thai language|Central Thai dialects]].

==Varieties and related languages==
Although [[Thai language|Central Thai]] is most widely spoken, Thailand is home to other related [[Tai languages]]. Although linguists usually classify these idioms as related, but distinct languages, native speakers often identify them as regional variants or dialects of the "same" Thai language, or as "different kinds of Thai".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Antonio L. Rappa |author2=Lionel Wee |title=Language Policy and Modernity in Southeast Asia: Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand |publisher=Springer |year=2006 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Southern Thai (Eastern)====
* Nakhonsithammarat dialect (Standard), spoken in upper part of [[Nakhon Si Thammarat province]] and eastern part of [[Surat Thani province]].
* Thungsong dialect, spoken in lower part of [[Nakhon Si Thammarat province]] and surround provinces such as [[Phatthalung Province]].

==Distribution==
In Thailand, speakers of Southern Thai can be found in a contiguous region beginning as far north as southern part of [[Prachuap Khiri Khan Province]] and extending southward to the border with [[Malaysia]]. Smaller numbers of speakers reside in the Malaysian border states, especially [[Kedah]], [[Kelantan]], [[Penang]], [[Perlis]], and [[Perak]]. In these areas, it is the primary language of ethnic Thais as well as of the ethnically Malay people on both sides of the Thai-Malaysian border in Satun and Songkhla provinces. Although numerous regional variations exist and there is no one standard, the language is most distinct near the Malaysian border. All varieties, however, remain mutually intelligible. For economic reasons, many speakers of Southern Thai have migrated to Bangkok and other Thai cities. Some have also emigrated to the Malaysia, which offers not only economic opportunity but also a culture which shares the [[Islam]]ic faith practiced by some speakers of Southern Thai.

==History==
Malay kingdoms ruled much of the [[Malay Peninsula]],{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} such as the [[Pattani Kingdom]] and [[Tambralinga]], but most of the area, at one time or another, was under the rule of [[Srivijaya]]. The population of the Malay peninsula was heavily influenced by the culture of [[demographics of India|India]] transmitted through missionaries or indirectly through traders. Numerous Buddhist and Hindu shrines attest to the diffusion of Indian culture. The power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the growth of the kingdom of [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], which subsequently became a vassal of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]]. The area has been a frontier between the northern [[Tai peoples]] and the southern [[ethnic Malays]] as well as between [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]].

==Phonology==

===Dialects===
*Ligor dialect, spoken in [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Province|Nakhon Si Thammarat]], [[Phatthalung Province|Phatthalung]], [[Trang Province|Trang]], [[Satun Province|Satun]] provinces and [[Mueang Pattani District|Mueang Pattani]] [[Kedah|Kedah state]], [[Mae Lan District|Mae Lan]], [[Khok Pho District|Khok Pho]] and [[Nong Chik District|Nong Chik]] Districts of [[Pattani Province]].
*Chaiya dialect, spoken in [[Krabi Province|Krabi]], [[Phang Nga Province|Phang Nga]], [[Phuket Province|Phuket]], [[Ranong Province|Ranong]], [[Surat Thani Province|Surat Thani]] and [[Chumphon Province|Chumphon]] Provinces.
*Singora dialect, spoken in [[Songkhla Province|Songkhla]], [[Yala Province|Yala]] and mostly part of [[Pattani Province|Pattani]] Provinces.

==Differences from Central Thai==
Although of the major regional languages of Thailand, Southern Thai is most similar in [[lexicon]] and grammar to Central Thai, the varieties are sufficiently different that mutual intelligibility between the two can be problematic. Southern Thai presents a [[diglossic]] situation wherein [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] range from the most formal (Standard Central Thai spoken with Southern Thai tones and accent) to the common vernacular (usually a contracted form of Thai expressions and with some amount of loan words from [[Malay language|Malay]]). The Thai language was introduced with Siamese incursions into the Malay Peninsula possibly starting as early as the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]]. During this and successive kingdoms, the area in which Southern Thai is spoken was a frontier zone between Thai polities and the Malay Sultanates.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Malay vocabulary has been absorbed into the lexicon, as a considerable number of Malay speakers lived in or near Patani polity and interacted with the Thai speakers through trade; and the Malay language was formerly considered to be a [[lingua franca]] of the southern part of the Malay peninsula.

Southern Thai is mainly a spoken language, although the [[Thai alphabet]] is often used in the informal situations when it is written.

The words used that are etymologically Thai are often spoken in a reduced and rapid manner, making comprehension by speakers of other varieties difficult.  Also, as Southern Thai uses up to seven tones in certain provinces, the tonal distribution is different from other regional varieties of Thai. Additionally, Southern Thai speakers almost always preserve ร as /r/ in contrast to [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]], the Lao-based [[Isan language]], and informal [[Register (phonology)|registers]] of Central Thai where it is generally realized as /l/.

The '''Tibetan Muslims''', also known as the '''Kachee''' ({{bo|t=ཁ་ཆེ་|w=kha-che}}; also spelled Kache), form a small minority in [[Tibet]]. Despite being [[Muslim]], they are [[List of ethnic groups in China#Officially recognized ethnic groups in mainland China|officially recognized]] as [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] by the [[Government of China|government]] of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], unlike the [[Hui people|Hui]] Muslims, who are separately recognized. The Tibetan word '''Kachee''' literally means '''[[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]]''' and [[Kashmir]] was known as '''Kachee Yul''' (Yul means Country).

== History ==

The appearance of the first Muslims in [[Tibet]] has been lost in the mists of time, although variants of the names of Tibet can be found in Arabic history books.

During the reign of the [[Ummayad]] [[Caliph]] [[Umar bin Abdul Aziz]], a delegation from [[Tibetan Empire|Tibet]] and [[Tang dynasty|China]] requested him to send Islamic missionaries to their countries, and [[Salah bin Abdullah Hanafi]] was sent to Tibet. Between the eighth and ninth centuries, the [[Abbasid]] rulers of [[Baghdad]] maintained relations with Tibet. However, there was little [[proselytisation]] among the missionaries at first, although many of them decided to settle in Tibet and marry Tibetan women. 

In 710-720, during the reign of [[Me Agtsom]], the [[Arabs]], who now had more of a presence in the inland China, started to appear in Tibet. 

During the reign of [[Sadnalegs]] (799-815), there was a protracted war against Arab powers to the West. It appears that Tibetans captured a number of Arab troops and pressed them into service on the eastern frontier in 801. Tibetans were active as far west as [[Samarkand]] and [[Kabul]]. Arab forces began to gain the upper hand, and the Tibetan governor of Kabul submitted to the Arabs and became a Muslim about 812 or 815 &lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I.

==Converts in Qinghai==

Islam was spread by the [[Salar people]] to the formerly Buddhist Kargan Tibetans in Lamo-shan-ken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Geographical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=776RAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1894|publisher=Royal Geographical Society.|pages=362–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Geographical Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KVOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA362#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=1894|publisher=Royal Geographical Society.|pages=362–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Tibetans in Qinghai who converted to Islam are now considered [[Hui people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=樊 |first=前锋 |date=2008-06-18  |title=青海，那些说藏语的回族乡亲  |url=http://www.chinesefolklore.com/news/news_detail.asp?id=1778 |newspaper=中国民俗网 |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2008-06-19 |title= 青海，那些讲藏话的回回 |url=http://zfhf.nxnews.net/home.php?mod=space&amp;uid=54488&amp;do=blog&amp;id=16111 |newspaper=宁夏新闻网 |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Balti people ==
{{main|Balti people}}

The [[Balti people]] of [[Baltistan]] in [[Pakistan]] and [[Kargil]] in [[India]] are descendants of Tibetan Buddhists who mostly converted to [[ Noorbakshia]] sect later on most of the people converted to [[Shia Islam]], and a few converted to [[Sunni]] Islam . Their [[Balti language]] is highly archaic and conservative and closer to [[Classical Tibetan]] than other [[Tibetan languages]].

This abrupt decimation in population count was largely due to the slaughter of tigers by colonial and Indian elite, during the British Raj period, and indeed following India's independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/03/10/a-concise-history-of-tiger-hunting-in-india&lt;/ref&gt; Most of those remaining, about 1,700, are India's [[Bengal tiger]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sharon-guynup/poaching-for-chinese-mark_b_6276984.html   Poaching for Chinese Markets Pushes Tigers to the Brink, 12/05/2014]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Project Tiger]] in India had been hailed as a great success until it was discovered that the initial count of tigers had been seriously flawed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/08/0807_030807_indiatiger.html Faulty Counts May Have Hurt India Tigers, Experts Say, Pallava Bagla, National Geographic News, August 7, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the tiger parts end up in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://roadsandkingdoms.com/2014/indias-hidden-tiger-poachers/ INDIA'S HIDDEN TIGER POACHERS, Roads and Kingdoms, Jun 20, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; where a single skin can sell for Rs. 6.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehelka.com/sansars-successors/  Sansar’s Successors, RAMAN KIRPAL, October 16, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sansar Chand, the notorious Tiger poacher acknowledged to selling 470 tiger skins and 2,130 leopard skins to just four clients from Nepal and Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/Sansar-Chand-notorious-tiger-poacher-dead/articleshow/32261903.cms Sansar Chand, notorious tiger poacher, dead TNN | Mar 19, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sansar Chand==

Sansar Chand,  from the Thanagazi area of Alwar district,  had been termed "the kingpin running the country’s biggest wildlife trade syndicate".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehelka.com/wriggling-out-of-the-skin/  Wriggling Out Of The Skin, Jay Mazoomdaar, Tehelka, 2013-07-27 ]&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed in the trade without getting arrested for 40 years. He ran his business from Delhi's Sadar Bazar. He was called "[[Veerappan]] of the North".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehelka.com/sansar-chand-is-indias-deadliest-poacher-here-is-how-he-has-escaped-legal-traps-for-40-years/  Sansar Chand Is India’s Deadliest Poacher. Here Is How He Has Escaped Legal Traps For 40 Years, RAMAN KIRPAL, Tehelka, August 7, 2010,]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is blamed for wiping out the entire tiger population of [[Sariska Tiger Reserve]] in 2005 &lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/sansar-chand-who-wiped-out-sariska-tigers-dies-of-cancer/#sthash.03oSSPFg.dpuf  Sansar Chand, who wiped out Sariska tigers, dies of cancer, Indian Express, March 18, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, a group arrested in Sawai Madhopur in Rajasthan confessed that they had poached 15 to 18 tigers in just two years for him. 
In January 2005, a raid at Chand's godown in Patel Nagar led to finding of two tiger skins, 28 leopard skins, 14 tiger canines, three kg of tiger claws, 10 tiger jaws and 60&amp;nbsp;kg of leopard and tiger paws. In 1988, police had seized 25,800 snake skins from him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.outlookindia.com/news/printitem.aspx?307669  Poacher Sansar Chand arrested in Delhi, Outlook, JUN 30, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Sansar Chand's wife Rani and son Akash have also been arrested for wild life trafficking&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Haider|first1=Tanseem|title=Notorious poacher Sansar Chand's son arrested in Delhi for wildlife trade|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/notorious-poacher-sansar-chands-son-arrested-in-delhi-for-wildlife-trade/1/713274.html|accessdate=19 October 2017|publisher=India Today|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Varahagiri Venkata Giri''' {{audio|Vvg.ogg|pronunciation}} (10 August 1894 – 24 June 1980), commonly known as '''V. V. Giri''', was the [[List of Presidents of India|fourth]] [[president of India]] from 24 August 1969 to 24 August 1974.

As president, Giri was the only person to be elected as an independent candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-vs-opposition-india-set-to-witness-tightest-presidential-poll-since-1969/story-sZ5LlpWvMBaxPULLoQHZbN.html |title=NDA vs Oppn: India might to witness tightest presidential poll since 1969 |last=Chatterji |first=Saubhadra |date=2017-04-26 |website=[[Hindustan Times]] |language=en |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed]] as president in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/gal.html | title=Gallery of Indian Presidents |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171212121818/http://pib.nic.in/archieve/others/gal.html |archive-date=2017-12-12 |website=[[Press Information Bureau]] |publisher=Government of India |access-date=2018-06-21 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of his full term, Giri was honoured by the [[Government of India]] with the [[Bharat Ratna]] in 1975. Giri died on 24 June 1980. His great grandson V. Giri Shankar is an Advocate of the Madras High Court, Chennai.

==Early life==
Giri was born in [[Berhampur]], [[Odisha]] to a [[Telugu people|Telugu]] [[Niyogi Brahmin]] family. His father, V. V. Jogayya  Pantulu, was a successful lawyer and political activist of the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Great Indian Patriots, Volume 1|last=Rao|first=P. Rajeswar|publisher=Mittal Publications|year=1991|isbn=9788170992806|location=India|pages=279–282|quote=|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giri's mother Subhadramma was active in the national movement in Berhampur during the [[Non Cooperation Movement|Non Cooperation]] and [[Civil Disobedience Movement]]s and was arrested for leading a strike for [[prohibition]] during the Civil Disobedience Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sarma|first1=Bina Kumari|title=Women’s Role in the Freedom Movement in South Orissa|journal=Orissa Review|date=August 2010|pages=34–35|url=http://orissa.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2010/August/engpdf/34-38.pdf|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giri was married to Saraswati Bai and the couple had 14 children.&lt;ref name="Rao1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=P. Rajeswar Rao|title=The Great Indian Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eTrs9MF9374C&amp;pg=PA278|year=1991|publisher=Mittal Publications|isbn=978-81-7099-280-6|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giri completed his initial education at the [[Khallikote College]], then affiliated with [[Utkal University]], in Berhampur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Varahagiri Venkata Giri|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/234218/Varahagiri-Venkata-Giri|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 he went to Ireland to study law which he did at [[University College Dublin]] and the [[King's Inns|Honourable Society of King's Inns, Dublin]] between 1913–1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University College Dublin announces special scholarships for Indian students|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/university-college-dublin-announces-special-scholarships-for-indian-students/1/328125.html|accessdate=8 January 2015|publisher=India Today|date=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giri was one among the first crop of thirteen Indian students who sat the obligatory year long course at UCD in 1914–15. This was a requirement for being called to the Irish Bar through study at the King's Inns. In total, 50 Indian students studied at UCD between 1914 and 1917.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irish Days, Indian Memories: V. V. Giri and Indian Law Students at University College Dublin, 1913–1916|last=Mulvagh|first=Conor|publisher=Irish Academic Press|year=2016|isbn=978-1-911024-18-7|location=Sallins|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giri and a fellow law student also enrolled to study on the full bachelor of arts course in UCD. Giri studied English, where he was lectured by [[Thomas MacDonagh]], and Political Economy. His lecturer in political economy was the reformer and co-operativist [[Thomas A. Finlay|Thomas A. Finlay SJ]].

During the First World War, Giri travelled from Dublin to London and met with [[Mahatma Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Gandhi wanted for Giri to join the Imperial war effort as a Red Cross Volunteer. Giri initially acceded to Gandhi's request but later regretted his decision. According to one of Giri's biographers, "Gandhiji with his characteristic magnanimity relieved Giri of the obligation to join the Red Cross and did not breathe a word about it to anyone.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/gandhi-an-expelled-future-president-and-first-aid-crews-the-indians-of-1916-rising-1.2529440|title=Gandhi, an expelled future president and first aid crews: the Indians of  1916 Rising|last=Mulvagh|first=Conor|date=10 February 2016|work=|newspaper=The Irish Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giri was active in both Indian and Irish politics during his studies. Along with fellow Indian students he produced a pamphlet documenting the abuse of Indians in South Africa. The pamphlet was intercepted by [[Indian Political Intelligence Office|Indian Political Intelligence]] and resulted in increased police scrutiny of Giri and his fellow students in Dublin.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Meanwhile, anonymous articles were written by Indian students for the newspaper of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and in ''The National Student'', a UCD student magazine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Irish Days, Indian Memories: V.

Upon returning to India in 1916 Giri enrolled at the [[Madras High Court]].&lt;ref name="The Deccan Herald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Worker’s leader who turned President|url=http://archive.deccanherald.com/Deccanherald/aug082004/ac3.asp|accessdate=24 January 2015|publisher=The Deccan Herald|date=8 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became a member of the Congress party, attended its [[Lucknow]] session and joined the [[Home Rule Movement]] of [[Annie Beasant]].&lt;ref name="Jai2003 76"&gt;{{cite book|author=Janak Raj Jai|title=Presidents of India, 1950–2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r2C2InxI0xAC&amp;pg=PA76|date=1 January 2003|publisher=Regency Publications|isbn=978-81-87498-65-0|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giri abandoned a flourishing legal career in response to [[Mahatma Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi's]] call for a [[Non-Cooperation Movement]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shekhawat need not compare himself to Giri: Shashi Bhushan|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/shekhawat-need-not-compare-himself-to-giri-shashi-bhushan/article1871463.ece|accessdate=8 January 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=12 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, he was arrested for the first time for demonstrating against the sale of liquor shops.&lt;ref name="The Deccan Herald"/&gt;

The strike succeeded in forcing the [[British Raj|British Indian government]] and the management of the railway company to concede the workers' demands and is regarded as a milestone in the labour movement in India.&lt;ref name="The Deccan Herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reminiscences of Gandhiji"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A principled politician"/&gt;

'''Virginia Durr Moment''' is a phrase originating in developmental psychology which refers to an experience and "triggering event" which can foster the moral development of an individual.  Characteristic of the experience is a serious '''challenge''' to an individual's value system. The book [[Some Do Care]] by developmental psychologists [[William Damon]] and [[Anne Colby]] (who are husband and wife), use the experience of [[Virginia Foster Durr]] to describe this phenomenon.  Although Durr is known as a civil rights activist, in her early years she harbored racial prejudice—a result of her upbringing in the South. When Durr was a student at [[Wellesley College]], her prejudiced value system was first seriously challenged.&lt;ref name="Durr"&gt;{{cite web

On her first night at Wellesley, Durr refused to dine at the same table at which a Negro girl was sitting.  The head of the house explained that the rules of [[Wellesley College]] required Durr to dine with the girl for one month, and that if Durr did not comply, she would have to withdraw from the college.  As Damon and Colby explain "this was the first time Virginia's values had ever been seriously challenged and she stayed awake all night long worrying about the dilemma".  They later go on to quote Durr "That was the first time I became aware that my attitude was considered foolish by some people and that Wellesley College wasn't going to stand for it.  That experience had a tremendous effect on me." (pg, 99, Some Do Care).   The book [[Educating Citizens]]: Preparing America's Undergraduates for Lives of Moral and Civic Responsibility, also describes the developmental significance of Durr's challenge from Wellesley: "[T]he incident lodged in Virginia's memory, creat[ed] a fracture in her convictions about race that contributed to their later destruction" (pg. 3 Educating Citizens). 

A '''Virginia Durr Moment''' refers to those experiences which—when used correctly—foster moral development. A '''Virginia Durr Moment''' presents one with the opportunity for growth via the evolution of one's value system via seriously challenging one's value system in a manner which causes one to reflect on and, as a result of this reflection, reject it in whole or in part.  When used correctly, the signature causal sequence of a '''Virginia Durr Moment''' consists in: serious challenge--&gt;self-reflection--&gt;modification of value system--&gt;moral development.  Ultimately, it is up to the individual to use the Moment to promote growth and further his/her moral development.   In the [[United Kingdom]],  some circles understand [[Paul McCartney]]'s [[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]] as describing the moral development fostered by the '''proper''' usage of a '''Virginia Durr Moment'''.  An individual may experience a '''Virginia Durr Moment''' and fail to use its power, thereby remaining in a condition of developmental stasis and moral immaturity.

'''Ájtte''', the Swedish Mountain and Sami Museum ({{lang-sv|Svenskt fjäll- och samemuseum}}), is a cultural and natural history museum in [[Jokkmokk]] in [[Lapland (Sweden)|Lapland]], [[Sweden]]. 

Ájtte is a museum, which specializes in the culture and nature of the mountainous area of Northern Sweden, and which is also the main museum and archive for the [[Sami culture]] of Sweden. Ájtte is also an information centre for tourism in Lapland. The word ''ájtte'' is a [[Lule Sami language]] one, meaning storage hut and referring to the museum as an archive for artifacts of the Sami cultural heritage.

Ájtte was inaugurated in June 1989 and has a staff of about 25 employees. The museum is owned and managed by a foundation, which was established in 1983 by the Swedish Government, the Norrbotten Region, the [[Jokkmokk Municipality]] and the two national Sami organizations Svenska Samernas Riksförbund (National Union of Swedish Sami people) and  Same Ätnam (Sami land). According to an agreement on financing of the museum, which was entered into the same year, the Government bodies commit themselves to a long term financial contribution to the museum. Such funds are the result of a court decision regarding compensation after rivers in Lapland have been exploited for electric power generation. The Swedish government appoints the chairman and three of the members of the board of the foundation. Thus, government funds cover around half of the current budget of the museum.&lt;ref&gt; Enquiry into the coordination of museums in Sweden, SOU 2009:15, page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jokkmokk Alpine Garden==
Since 1995 Ájtte has established an alpine botanical garden at the valley of Kvarnbäcken in Jokkmokk with plants from different environments of the mountain range of Northern Scandinavia. One of the century old researcher cottages from [[Sarek National Park]], designed and used by the pioneering scientist [[Axel Hamberg]], has been dismantled and moved from Sarek and reerected in the botanical garden.
