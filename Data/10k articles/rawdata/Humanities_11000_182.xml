'''Albert Sechehaye''' ({{IPA-fr|se.ʃə.ɛ|lang}}; 4 July 1870, [[Geneva]] – 2 July 1946, Geneva) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] linguist. He is known for editing [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s lectures, ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]''.

==Biography==
Sechehaye studied at the [[University of Geneva]] under Ferdinand de Saussure. From 1893 to 1902 he trained at [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], where he wrote a thesis in German about the French [[imperfect]] [[subjunctive]]. After that, he taught in Geneva until his death, though not becoming a professor until 1939, when he succeeded his colleague [[Charles Bally]]. His wife [[Marguerite Sechehaye]] was a psychotherapist and a pioneer in the psychoanalytic treatment of schizophrenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.peterharrington.co.uk/rare-books/psychoanalysis-sciences/reality-lost-and-regained-autobiography-of-a-schizophrenic-girl/| title =SECHEHAYE, Marguerite A. - Reality Lost and Regained.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4367">'''Allahdino''' is a small village belonging to the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Harappan]] period, located 40&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Karachi]]. It is an unfortified settlement of 1.4 hectare, established in a coastal area of [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=Singh&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Upinder|title=A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Education India|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-813-17-1120-0|page=156|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&amp;pg |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This small but well organised settlement was abandoned by c.2000 BC.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=The Ancient Indus Civilisation: New Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781576079072|pages=93,229,333,327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+ancient+indus+valley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wd3vT-esGImGrAfPyPm9DQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=allahdino&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excavations==
Several mud brick houses, sometimes built on stone platforms were excavated from this site. A large multiroomed house with a mudbrick platform was also excavated. One building had three wells, with diameters of 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 90&amp;nbsp;cm. In fact, all the wells found on this site had similarly small diameters.&lt;ref name="Singh"/&gt; The layout of the settlement and buildings suggest that Allahdino was involved with administrative role.&lt;ref name=McIntosh229&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=The Ancient Indus Civilisation: New Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781576079072|pages=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+ancient+indus+valley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wd3vT-esGImGrAfPyPm9DQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=allahdino&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artifacts found==
Large quantities of [[copper]] objects, triangular terracotta cakes, seals, small [[terracotta]] jars with profusions of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[bronze]] and other ornaments were found.&lt;ref name=Singh/&gt; Several jars, one containing gold and silver ornaments, were also found here.&lt;ref name=McIntosh333&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=The Ancient Indus Civilisation: New Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781576079072|pages=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+ancient+indus+valley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wd3vT-esGImGrAfPyPm9DQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=allahdino&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A belt containing 36 [[carnelian]] beads was found, proof of highly skilled workers being settled in the area.&lt;ref name=McIntosh327&gt;{{cite book|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|title=The Ancient Indus Civilisation: New Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, California|isbn=9781576079072|pages=327|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+ancient+indus+valley&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wd3vT-esGImGrAfPyPm9DQ&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=allahdino&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Archeologists]] believe that findings of gold and silver ornaments, as well as the usage of stone at the village indicate some of the residents were well to do.&lt;ref name=Singh/&gt; This site is well excavated one and a total of 240,000 vessels and shreds were collected and tabulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dales,|first=George F.|last2=Kenoyer|first2=Jonathan M.|title=Excavations at Mohenjo Daro, Pakistan : the pottery, with an account of the pottery from the 1950 excavations of Sir Mortimer Wheeler|year=1986|publisher=University Museum, University of Pennsylvania|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780934718523|pages=9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iew_THp8foC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kenoyer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gIb1T6z8IcfhrAeyu6XVBg&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=kenoyer&amp;f=false|last3=Alcock |first3=Leslie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a philosophy, aesthetics was developed in 18th CE Germany by [[Immanuel Kant|Emmanuel Kant.]] &lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/anc-aest/|title=Ancient Aesthetics|last=Celkyte|first=Aiste|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Greek and Roman philosophers such as [[Aristotle]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sartwell|first=Crispin|title=Beauty|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/beauty/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leszl|first=Walter G.|date=2006-10-01|title=Plato’s attitude to poetry and the fine arts, and the origins of aesthetics|url=https://journals.openedition.org/etudesplatoniciennes/997#tocto1n5|journal=Études platoniciennes|language=en|issue=3|pages=245–336|doi=10.4000/etudesplatoniciennes.997|issn=2275-1785}}&lt;/ref&gt; partook in the rhetorical debate of aesthetic perception and properties as its own branch of philosophy.

Influence of beauty was derived from their Gods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Greek Gods and Goddesses of Greek mythology|Greek gods]] were believed to take a divine human form and inspired their perception of divine beauty. Temples were created in Greece to worship these gods and were filled with life-like images of them. &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/howartmadetheworld/episodes/human/greece/|title=How Art Made the World .

==== Form ====
Ancient Greeks were fixated on the aesthetic form of the human body.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; This ideal was captured through the art of this era. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;Sculptures were inspired initially by the monumental art of the Ancient Egyptians.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; Sculptures were perceived to be at their peak of aesthetics when the human form was captured in a unique way and emphasizing a divine or godlike quality. Proportion, poise and perfection of the human form were the artistic and aesthetic ideals.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Sculpture/|title=Ancient Greek Sculpture|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and bronze monuments are iconic of this civilization. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

'''Biological functionalism''' is an [[anthropological]] paradigm, asserting that all [[social organisation|social institutions]], beliefs, values and practices serve to address pragmatic concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |title=The Meaning of "Life" |author=Austin, D.F. |year=2000 |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624005750/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~n51ls801/340life.html |archivedate=24 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In many ways, the theorem derives from the longer-established [[structural functionalism]], yet the two theorems diverge from one another significantly.&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-rathouse.com/EvenMoreAustrianProgram/EMACulturevsGMProg.html |title=Comparing "The Strong Program in Cultural Theory |accessdate=23 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While both maintain the fundamental belief that a [[social structure]] is composed of many interdependent [[frame of reference|frames of reference]], biological functionalists criticise the structural view that a [[solidarity (sociology)|social solidarity]] and collective conscience is required in a functioning system.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt; By that fact, biological functionalism maintains that our individual survival and health is the driving provocation of actions, and that the importance of social rigidity is negligible.

==Everyday application==
Although the actions of humans without doubt do not always engender positive results for the individual, a biological functionalist would argue that the intention was still [[self-preservation]], albeit unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |title=Biological Adaptation in Human Societies: A 'Basic Needs' Approach |author=Corning, Peter A. |accessdate=23 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725082133/http://www.complexsystems.org/publications/pdf/basic_needs.pdf |archivedate=25 July 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the belief in luck as an entity; while a disproportionately strong belief in good luck may lead to undesirable results, such as a huge loss in money from gambling, biological functionalism maintains that the newly created ability of the gambler to condemn luck will allow them to be free of individual blame, thus serving a practical and individual purpose. In this sense, biological functionalism maintains that while bad results often occur in life, which do not serve any pragmatic concerns, an entrenched [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychological]] motivation was attempting to create a positive result, in spite of its eventual failure.

'''''Bishop Petros with Saint Peter the Apostle''''' ({{Lang-pl|Biskup Petros ze świętym Piotrem Apostołem}}) is a [[Nubia]]n Christian wall painting from the last quarter of the 10th century.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} Made with [[tempera]] on [[silt]] [[plaster]] using a [[Fresco-secco|''al secco'']] [[fresco]] technique, it depicts Petros, the bishop of [[Faras]] between 974 and 997. The anonymous work was discovered in the ruins of [[Faras Cathedral]], an important religious centre of Nubia, in modern [[Sudan]]. Rescued from flooding when [[Lake Nasser]] was created, since 1964 it is part of the Faras Gallery of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]].{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

The painting, which used to be part of a larger composition, representing King [[Georgios II of Makuria]] with the [[Virgin and Child]], was painted on the west wall of the chapel located in the southern [[nave]] of the cathedral.  The portrait of the bishop was placed to the right of the image of the king. The representation of the two highest hierarchs of the state along with their [[patron saints]] indicated the supernatural origin of the power of the nobles and symbolized the unity of the clerical and secular power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|p=182}}

The image was created in Petros' lifetime, which is suggested by the inscription in Greek accompanying the painting, wishing him "many years [of life]".{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} The painting is considered one of the most precious images of Nubian officials found in the Cathedral of Faras{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} and is also one of six best preserved portraits of bishops discovered there.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=176}}

== History ==
The painting, like most other pieces of {{Interlanguage link multi|Christian Nubian art|pl|3=Chrześcijańskie malarstwo nubijskie|lt=Nubian art}} in the {{Interlanguage link multi|Faras Gallery|pl|3=Galeria Faras im. Profesora Kazimierza Michałowskiego w Muzeum Narodowym w Warszawie}} of the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum in Warsaw]], was recovered by Polish archaeologists during the so-called Nubian Campaign, an international effort led by [[UNESCO]] prior to construction of the [[Lake Nasser|Nasser Dam]]. The excavations, carried out between 1961 and 1964, discovered a religious complex in the town of Faras (ancient Pachoras), near modern Sudanese-Egyptian border. Well-preserved ruins of a large Christian cathedral from 7th to 14th centuries contained well-preserved wall religious paintings.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

Since the area was to be flooded by the waters of the artificial Lake Nasser, a team of Polish archaeologists led by [[Kazimierz Michałowski]] was allowed to recover the artifacts. A major part was then transported to the [[National Museum of Sudan]], where a team of Polish scientists led by [[Józef Gazy]] carried out {{Interlanguage link multi|Conservation and restoration of Faras wall paintings|pl|3=Konserwacja i restauracja malowideł ściennych z Faras|lt=their conservation}}. Some 40 per cent were transported to the National Museum of Warsaw, becoming the nucleus of the future Faras Gallery.{{Sfn|Sulikowska|2015|loc=¶ 1–12}}

The image itself was painted by an anonymous artist some time during bishop Petros' tenure, between 974 and 999 AD.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}} It represents the so-called yellow and red style, typical of a transitional period between the white style of 9th century and later multicolour style introduced in the 11th century and typical of all later wall paintings at Faras until its abandonment in the 14th century. Other images representative of the yellow and red style found at Faras represent King Georgios, a ''Virgin and Child'', ''Three Men in the Fiery Furnace'', as well as a Passion Cycle. The red and yellow style paintings are considered among the most interesting, both visually and for their theological message.{{Sfn|Michałowski|1974}}

== Description ==
[[File:Faras_-_Restoration_in_MNW-04.jpg|thumb|Work on conservation and restoration of the fresco in Warsaw's National Museum, 1964–1966]]

The dark-skinned bishop is depicted wearing his liturgical robes, complete with a narrow, white handkerchief (''[[encheiron]]'') wound around the index finger of his right palm. With it he points at a [[Gospel Book]] he holds in his other arm.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Petros is dressed in a long white robe (''[[sticharion]]'') with vertical green stripes. His yellow ''[[phelonion]]'' (a type of [[chasuble]]), in the shape of an elongated ellipse, is adorned with a pattern of a red net, with precious stones sewn into the fabric. The edge of the chasuble is also adorned with a strip of fabric with green and red jewels. Bishop's ''[[epitrachelion]]'' is decorated with yellow wheels with a green circuit and red rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|p=178}} The ''[[omophorion]]'', one of symbols of episcopal dignity, is white with a pattern of circles and rectangles.{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=181–182}} The head of the bishop is wrapped in a turban characteristic of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]] hierarchs, which could suggest that Petros was a [[Monophysitism|monophysite]].{{sfn|Gołgowski|1967|pp=186–188}}

Behind the bishop stands Saint [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]], dressed in a white crown signifying martyrdom. The saint has both hands on the shoulders of the bishop.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}} This pose, common in Nubian painting of the epoch, signifies the fact that the saint protects and supports the bishop,{{sfn|Martens-Czarnecka|2006|p=35}} but also points at the supernatural character of bishop's power.{{sfn|Mierzejewska|2014|pp=180–182}}

Around the head of Saint Peter there is a black inscription in Greek: SAINT PETER THE APOSTLE MARTYR OF THE CROSS ABBA PETROS BISHOP AND METROPOLITAN OF PACHORAS [may he live] MANY YEARS.{{Sfn|Mierzejewska|2016|loc="Opis"}}

'''Brunton, Inc.''' ® is a manufacturer of technical outdoor gear located in [[Riverton, Wyoming]].  Brunton is well known for innovation in the categories of recreational [[compass]]es, navigational equipment, and survey instruments.

==History==
David W. Brunton, a Canadian-born geologist and mining engineer, and William Aimsworth, a skilled watch repairman, founded Brunton in 1895. The firm is most famous for its earliest product, the [[Brunton compass|Brunton Pocket Transit]]®. [[Geologist]]s, foresters, surveyors, and [[archaeologist]]s&lt;ref name="WIL"&gt;Willoughby, Tim, ''[http://www.aspentimes.com/article/20100808/ASPENWEEKLY/100809925 David W. Brunton and his compass]'', Aspen Times, retrieved 25 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  use this handheld compass and clinometer. Often simply called a "Brunton", the ''Pocket Transit'' was first patented in 1894 by David Brunton, who commissioned William Ainsworth &amp; Sons to manufacture his invention in Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref name="WIL"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kooters.com/sezbrntn.html |title= Tips for selecting a Brunton pocket transit |accessdate= 2010-10-03 |work=  |publisher= Kooter's Geology Tools |date= 2009-10-06 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100427034455/http://www.kooters.com/sezbrntn.html |archivedate= 2010-04-27 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The company later incorporated as William Ainsworth Inc. and for many years produced the ''Pocket Transit'' along with surveying transits, theodolites, and other instruments.

By 1965, William Ainsworth Inc. was owned by a series of corporate conglomerates, and product quality varied as the company changed hands repeatedly.  In 1972, a group of businessmen from Riverton, Wyoming bought the company and formed Brunton, Inc.  In Riverton, Brunton began producing a new series of recreational outdoor compasses, hunting knives, and binoculars in addition to the ''Brunton Pocket Transit''.

In 1996, the company was acquired by [[Silva compass|Silva of Sweden AB]], the original Swedish-based manufacturer of the ''Silva'' brand compass.  Initially, Brunton sold Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS devices imported from Sweden under the ''Elite'' ''Pro Elite'', ''Nexus'', and ''MNS'' labels (Johnson Outdoors retained the exclusive rights to the ''Silva'' ® brand name in North America).  Brunton began sourcing some of its compass models from Asia.&lt;ref name="SCH"&gt;Scheer, Joshua, ''[http://dailyranger.com/story.php?story_id=706&amp;headline=Expansion-at-Brunton-promises-50-new-jobs Expansion at Brunton Promises 50 New Jobs]'', The Ranger, 15 March 2012, retrieved 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OVE"&gt;Over, Ernie, ''[http://county10.com/2012/03/14/a-360-turnaround-bruntons-compass-manufacturing-relocated-to-riverton-from-china/ A 180° turnaround: Brunton’s Compass manufacturing relocated to Riverton from China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615084413/http://county10.com/2012/03/14/a-360-turnaround-bruntons-compass-manufacturing-relocated-to-riverton-from-china/# |date=2012-06-15 }}'', County 10 News Desk, County10.com, 14 March 2012, retrieved 12 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Silva Group was acquired by the Finnish [[Fiskars Corporation]],&lt;ref name="ALL"&gt;Allonen, Heikki, ''Fiskars Acquires Swedish Silva Group'', Stock Exchange Press Release, Fiskars Corporation, 30 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;.  Along with the rest of  the Silva Group, Brunton became part of the Outdoor division of Fiskars. As of 2009, Brunton, Inc. employed about 40 people.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://flashlightnews.org/story2763.shtml Fiskars to Sell Brunton to Fenix Outdoor]'', FlashlighNews.org, retrieved 25 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Fiskars announced the sale of Brunton Inc. to Fenix Outdoor AB, a Swedish company.&lt;ref&gt;''Fiskars Sells US Camping Equipment Business to Fenix Outdoor'', Nordic Business Report, 4 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of Fiskars divestment of Brunton Inc., Silva of Sweden AB ceased all exports of its Swedish-made compasses and GPS devices to North America, including the ''Nexus'', ''Elite'', and ''Pro Elite'' lines. In turn, Brunton ceased export of its model 8020, 8040, and 9020 compasses to Silva of Sweden AB. 

As of March 2012, the company employed around 68 people at its Riverton, Wyoming manufacturing facility.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;

==Product Range==
===Compasses===
As William Ainsworth Inc., production of the ''Pocket Transit™'' continued''.'' The ''Pocket Transit'' remains in production today, and is offered in numerous versions and configurations. In 1970, the company introduced the ''Brunton Cadet'', a simplified evolution of the Pocket Transit incorporating a compass and clinometer, intended for use in training students in the fields of geology, forestry, mining, and surveying.&lt;ref name="BL"&gt;''Boys' Life: Gifts &amp; Gimmicks'', Vol. 60 No. 6 (June 1970), ''[[Boys' Life]]'', Boy Scouts of America, ISSN 0006-8608, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  The company soon began marketing the ''Cadet'' to instruct Boy Scouts in the principles of surveying.&lt;ref name="BL"/&gt;  
[[Image:Kompass Silva.jpg|thumb|right|225px|A Brunton 9020G/Silva ''Voyager'' compass]]
In 1972, the newly formed Brunton, Inc. began compass and transit production in Riverton, Wyoming.  Compasses included the ''Pocket Transit'', ''Cadet'', and an emergency compass called the ''Life Card'', designed to float in a bowl of water. This was followed in 1981 by the Model 8040 ''Sportsman's Compass''™, a map (baseplate) compass with folding cover and mirror sight&lt;ref&gt;''Equip &amp; Go'', Backpacker Magazine, Vol. 9 No. 2 (April–May 1981), p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;. In the same year, Brunton introduced the Model 9020. This small baseplate compass was designed for hikers, outdoorsmen, and hunters.&lt;ref&gt;Darga, Bert, ''The Survival Bible'', New York, NY:  Bobbs-Merrill (Stonesong Press), {{ISBN|0672527073}}, 9780672527074 (1982), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next ten years, Brunton would introduce a full range of map or baseplate compasses based on a liquid-filled vial with ''no-tools adjustment'' for magnetic declination.  This new line included Models ''8010'', ''8020'', ''8040'', ''9020'', and the compact 9030 ''Trailbuster''.  Brunton baseplate compasses with a '''G'''  suffix (i.e. ''9020G)'' featured bright yellow-green acrylic baseplates. Brunton often included UTM and map scales for U.S. standard 1:24,000 and 1:62,500 USGS topographic maps. The ''Model 9030 Trailbuster''™, intended to replicate the popular 1960s-era Taylor ''Model 2912'' field compass, omitted the baseplate in order to minimize space and weight.

In 1991, the U.S. military purchased a number of Brunton Model ''8010'' ''Smoke Chaser''™  compasses originally produced for [[U.S. Forest Service]] fire-fighting crews.  These were stocked in survival kits for U.S. Navy and Marine flight crews. These Model 8010 compasses used clear baseplates and were equipped with lanyards.  The compasses were shipped in plain cardboard boxes with military stock number NSN 6605-00-553-8795.  Brunton discontinued all 8000- and 9000- series compasses in 2011.

After being aquired by Silva, Brunton began selling Silva of Sweden compasses and GPS devices. The Nexus line included the Silva Model 15T and Model 25 ''Ranger'' compasses, rebranded as the Nexus 15TDC and 25TDC Pro Elite. Brunton also began importing some compass models from Taiwan and mainland China, including the ''Model 9030'' and ''Models 9075'' and ''9077'' lensatic compasses. Silva of Sweden also sold some Brunton models under the Silva ''Voyager''™ name.

In 1998, Brunton introduced its ''Eclipse™'' range of liquid-filled baseplate compasses featuring low-profile vials, a magnified readout in 1-degree increments, and a patented ''circle-over-circle'' magnetized disk in place of a traditional pointed needle.&lt;ref&gt;''HAND-HELD NEEDLELESS COMPASS'', U.S. Patent No. 6282802 Filed 14 August 1998, Issued 4 September 2001, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Patent Office&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Eclipse'' compasses included the ''Model 8096 GPS'', the ''Model 8097'', and the ''Model 8099 Pro''.  Like older Brunton outdoor compasses, the ''Eclipse'' series used ''no-tools'' adjustable declination.  Designed by Brunton, but imported from China,&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt; some owners of ''Eclipse'' compasses reported issues with air bubbles forming in the compass vials.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rockclimbing.com/gear/Archive/Eclipse_769.html Eclipse: Rock Climbing Gear]'', retrieved 26 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Brunton introduced an electronic fluxgate compass called the ''Brunton Outback''™. Imported from Taiwan, the ''Outback'' featured gimbal-mounted magnetic sensors which allowed the unit to be tilted up to 15 degrees while producing accurate readings.  The ''Outback'' stored up to 10 bearings in its memory. A night navigation mode warned if the user was moving off-track with illuminated arrows. The ''Outback'' was eventually replaced by the Brunton ''Nomad''™ electronic compass.  After complaints about calibration and inaccurate bearings, the ''Nomad'' was  discontinued in 2011. 
     
In 2009, Brunton stopped selling most Silva of Sweden products.  The ''Nexus'' and ''Elite'' lines were discontinued, as well as the ''Brunton 54LU'' (''Silva Model 54).'' The ''Brunton 54LU'' was marketed to foresters, surveyors, geologists, and SAR teams before being discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;''Brunton Discontinuing The Best Compass Ever (Brunton 54LU)'', Extreme Tolerance.Com, 21 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.sierratradingpost.com/brunton-54lu-baseplate-map-compass-mirrored-sighting~p~2535h/reviews/15780082~outstanding-compass/ Outstanding Compass!]'', SierraTradingPost.com, 15 December 2010, retrieved 13 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Silva models, including the ''Brunton 15TDCL'' and ''Brunton 16DLU'', were later sourced from a production facility in China. In 2011, Brunton discontinued the Models 8010G, 8020, 8040G, 9020G, and 9030 compasses.

In 2012, Brunton introduced a new series of outdoor compasses called ''O.S.S.''™ (''Orbital Sighting System)''.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt;  Like the ''Eclipse'' series, the O.S.S.™ compasses featured a large liquid-filled capsule and ''circle-over-circle'' north indicator. In addition, several design improvements set the ''O.S.S.''™ apart. These included a deep-well 'global' vial, a serrated outer bezel, a needle with an orienting circle instead of a magnetized disc, and map meridian lines imprinted in the base of the housing.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;  Unlike older ''Eclipse'' compasses, ''O.S.S.'' compasses were assembled in Riverton, Wyoming from components made in the United States.&lt;ref name="SCH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt;  As of 2012, Brunton is the only major compass manufacturer with U.S.-based production facilities.&lt;ref name="OVE"/&gt;

In 2014, Brunton dropped the circle-over-circle magnetized disk/needle design used in the ''Eclipse'' and ''O.S.S.'' series. Their current line of baseplate compasses, the TruArc™ series uses rare-earth magnets to stabilize the north indicator (needle), These compasses are designed to work in all magnetic zones. 

===GPS===
In 2000, Silva of Sweden AB introduced its Silva ''Multi-Navigator'' GPS device. Brunton marketed the product in North America as the Brunton ''MNS''™. The ''MNS'' featured an electronic compass, barometer, and barometric altimeter in addition to GPS functionality. With a relatively high energy consumption of 210 mA (or 270 mA with illumination on), the ''MNS'' had a battery life of around 10 hours. At $399, the ''Brunton MNS'' faced intense competition competitors such as ''Garmin'' and ''Magellan.'' Products with better battery life and improved scrolling menu displays kep the ''MNS'' from gaining significant market share. Furthermore, the ''MNS'' was not [[WAAS]] capable and did not offer internal storage of waypoints, routes or tracks. In 2004, Silva and Brunton introduced a slightly lower-priced, WAAS-capable GPS receiver called the ''Atlas''™.  This product also failed to gain a significant share of the handheld GPS market, and the Brunton ''MNS'' and ''Atlas'' were both discontinued by Brunton in 2009.

===Optics===
In 1992, Brunton introduced a line of binoculars and other optical equipment aimed at the hunting and outdoor recreation market. The optics line was discontinued in 2014.

It is usually inflicted on persons convicted of crimes against the state or adults determined by a court to be legally incompetent because of mental disability.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Interdiction of F.T.E., 594 So.2d 480

'''''Convent Thoughts''''' is a painting by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] painter [[Charles Allston Collins]] which was created between 1850 and 1851. Collins sent it to the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 1851 where it was exhibited.

The painting shows a nun contemplating a [[passion flower]] symbolising the crucifixion of Christ. She is standing in a walled garden full of minutely detailed flowers. In her left hand she holds an [[illumination (manuscript)|illuminated]] [[missal]], held not as though she had been reading it but so as to show us the Annunciation and the Crucifixion. Her costume shows that she is a novice, presumably meditating on her final vows.

The flowers were painted in the Oxford garden of [[Thomas Combe]], an early collector of Pre-Raphaelite paintings, and the model was his housemaid, Frances Sarah Ludlow, later Mrs Brucker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stsepulchres.org.uk/burials/brucker_william.html Friends of St Sepulchre's Cemetery]. Retrieved 28 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Combe bought the painting; in 1894 he bequeathed his art collection to the [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[Oxford]] and ''Convent Thoughts'' remains in the Museum's collection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objects/paintings/WA1894.10.php Charles Alston Collins (1828 - 1873) ''Convent Thoughts''] Ashmolean. Retrieved 27 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Collins was never formally a member of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, he was in sympathy with their aims and painted in their immensely detailed style. ''Convent Thoughts'' has a place in the history of Pre-Raphaelitism, because the tide of opinion, initially hostile, was to some extent turned by a letter to ''[[The Times]]'' on 13 May 1851 from the influential critic [[John Ruskin]] praising the Pre-Raphaelite paintings at the Academy exhibition, in particular ''Convent Thoughts'', about which he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I happen to have a special acquaintance with the water plant ''Alisma Plantago'' ... and as I never saw it so thoroughly or so well drawn, I must take leave to remonstrate with you, when you say sweepingly that these men 'sacrifice ''truth'' as well as feeling to eccentricity.' For as a mere botanical study of the Water Lily and ''Alisma'', as well as of the common lily and several other garden flowers, this picture would be invaluable to me, and I heartily wish it were mine."&lt;ref&gt;Ruskin, John. ''Collected Works'' ed. E.T.Cook and Alexander Wedderburn. London, George Allen, vol. XII p.321&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a curious footnote to this story, it has recently been pointed out&lt;ref&gt;Deas, Elizabeth. "The Missing Alisma: Ruskin's Botanical Error". ''Journal of Pre-Raphaelite Studies'' (Fall 2001): 4-13&lt;/ref&gt; that there is in fact no ''[[Alisma|Alisma Plantago]]'' in the picture.

{{Main|Foreign relations of China}}

Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China (PRC) has had a diplomatic tug-of-war with its rival in [[Taiwan]], the [[Republic of China]] (ROC). Throughout the [[Cold War]], both governments claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all China and allowed countries to recognize either one or the other. Until the 1970s, most Western countries recognized the ROC while the communist bloc and third world countries generally recognized the PRC. This gradually shifted and today only {{Numrec|ROC||UN member states recognize the ROC}} while the PRC is recognized by the [[United Nations]], 176 UN member states and 1 UN observer around the world. Both the ROC and the PRC maintain the requirement of recognizing its view of the [[One-China policy]] to establish or maintain diplomatic relations.

[[Image:PRC relations commencement.svg|425px|right|thumb|Countries of the world indicating decade diplomatic relations commenced with the PRC: 1949/1950s (dark red), 1960s (red), 1970s (orange), 1980s (beige) and 1990s/2000s (yellow). Countries not recognised by or not recognising the PRC are in grey. The PRC itself is in black.]]

==Recognition of the PRC before it was seated at the UN==

===1949===
The PRC was established on 1 October 1949, when the [[Chinese Civil War]] was still underway, and the seat of Government of the [[Republic of China]] was not relocated to Taipei until December 1949. All the countries that recognized the new PRC government in 1949 were [[communist state]]s.

|[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]&lt;ref name="YU"&gt;[[Serbia]] attempted to succeed but all other former Yugoslav Republics deferred the attempt, and no consensus was reached in the first period. The [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] est. 1992-02-28 was not granted successorship and was placed under international sanctions. In 2001 an Agreement on Succession Issues was signed and reached validity in 2004, by the provisions of that Agreement FRY is not the successor of SFRY. Serbia and Montenegro succeeded the United Nations seat of the FRY (joined the UN as a new member on 2000-11-01) "Succession" of recognition by Serbia, successor state of [[Serbia and Montenegro]] is due to international law inadmissible. Arbitration Commission of the Peace Conference on the former Yugoslavia Opinion No. 10 (Federal Republic of Yugoslavia - Serbia and Montenegro). In this decision, the Commission ruled that the FRY (Serbia and Montenegro) could not legally be considered a continuation of the former SFRY, but was rather a new state. Thus the European Community (and the UN) should not automatically recognize the FRY, but apply to it the same criteria applied to the recognition of the other post-SFRY states.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DemoticScriptsRosettaStoneReplica.jpg|thumb|[[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] script on a replica of the [[Rosetta Stone]].]]
The '''decipherment of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]''' was gradually achieved during the early 19th century. The most helpful clue was supplied by the discovery in 1799 of the [[Rosetta Stone]], an inscription in three scripts. Building on work by several other scholars, notably [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], the breakthrough to [[decipherment]] was made by [[Jean-François Champollion]].

The successful decipherment was preceded by a long period during which hieroglyphs were wrongly believed in Europe to be a purely [[ideographic]] script. In the 5th century appeared the ''Hieroglyphica'' of [[Horapollo]], a spurious explanation of almost 200 glyphs. Authoritative yet largely false, the work was a lasting impediment to the decipherment of Egyptian writing. But whereas earlier scholarship emphasized Greek origin of the document, more recent work{{who|date=February 2015}} has recognized remnants of genuine knowledge, and casts it as an attempt by an Egyptian intellectual to rescue an unrecoverable past.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} The ''Hieroglyphica'' was a major influence on [[Renaissance]] symbolism, particularly the [[emblem book]] of [[Andrea Alciato]], and including the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'' of [[Francesco Colonna]].

==Medieval Egyptian attempts==
[[File:Ibn Wahshiyya's 985 CE translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet.jpg|thumb|Ibn Wahshiyya's 985 CE translation of the Ancient Egyptian hieroglyph alphabet]]
Later attempts at deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] were made by [[Sociology in medieval Islam|Arab historians]] in [[History of Arab Egypt|medieval Egypt]] during the 9th and 10th centuries. By then, hieroglyphs had long been forgotten in [[Egypt]],&lt;!--Please give approximate date the hieroglyphs could no longer be read or deciphered. Which century?--&gt; and were replaced by the [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] and [[Arabic alphabet]]s. [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] and [[Ibn Wahshiyya]] were the first historians to be able to at least partly decipher what was written in the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Okasha El Daly (2005), ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings'', [[University College London|UCL Press]], {{ISBN|1-84472-063-2}}. ([[cf.]] [http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=481 Arabic Study of Ancient Egypt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083701/http://www.muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=481 |date=2007-09-29 }}, Foundation for Science Technology and Civilisation.)&lt;/ref&gt; by relating them to the contemporary [[Coptic language]] used by [[Copt]]ic priests in their time. Arabic manuscripts of Ibn Wahshiyya's work were later read by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the 17th century, and then translated and published in English by Joseph Hammer in 1806 as ''Ancient Alphabets and Hieroglyphic Characters Explained; with an Account of the Egyptian Priests, their Classes, Initiation, and Sacrifices in the Arabic Language by Ahmad Bin Abubekr Bin Wahishih'', contributing to the complete decipherment of hieroglyphs.&lt;ref name=Daly&gt;Dr. Okasha El Daly, [http://muslimheritage.com/topics/default.cfm?ArticleID=712 Deciphering Egyptian Hieroglyphs in Muslim Heritage], [[Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early European attempts==
[[File:Kingston Lacy- Egyptian obelisk and House (geograph 1789450).jpg|thumb|The Philae obelisk with [[Kingston Lacy]] in the background]]
The study of hieroglyphs continued centuries later, when various modern scholars attempted to decipher the glyphs, notably [[Johannes Goropius Becanus]] in the 16th century, [[Athanasius Kircher]] in the 17th, and [[Silvestre de Sacy]], [[Johan David Åkerblad]] and [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in the early 19th century, each making one important step toward the solution but failing to find it.

Young made the crucial breakthrough in 1814 when studying the Rosetta Stone. Guessing that hieroglyphs surrounded by a loop were of greater importance, such as representing a [[pharaoh]]'s name, he was able to discover the phonetics of the corresponding hieroglyphs by comparing the three different scripts. After identifying many of the hieroglyphs' sound values, he set aside his work for reasons not fully understood.&lt;ref name="The Code Book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Simon|title=The Code Book|date=2000|publisher=Fourth Estate|location=London|isbn=1-85702-889-9|pages=402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Athanasius Kircher]], a student of Coptic and Arabic, had read Ibn Wahshiyya's work in the 17th century and continued the study of hieroglyphs from where Ibn Wahshiyya had left off.&lt;ref name=Daly/&gt; Kircher further developed the notion that the last stage of Egyptian could be related to the earlier Egyptian stages. Because he was not able to transliterate or translate hieroglyphs, however, he could not prove this notion.

==French discoveries==
The discovery in 1799 of the Rosetta Stone by [[Napoleon]]'s troops (during [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's Egyptian invasion]]) provided the critical information which allowed [[Jean-François Champollion]], taking into the account the work of other scholars, to discover the nature of the script by the 1820s. He had been introduced to hieroglyphics at the tender age of 10 and so began a lifelong fascination.&lt;ref name="The Code Book"/&gt;

A significant breakthrough was made by Champollion in 1822, as reflected in his well-known ''[[Lettre à M. Dacier]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at once, in the same text, the same phrase, I would almost say in the same word." &lt;ref&gt;[[Jean-François Champollion]], &lt;cite&gt;Letter to [[Bon-Joseph Dacier|M. Dacier]]&lt;/cite&gt;, September 27, 1822&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;French text of the Letter: 
Jean-François Champollion, [[s:fr:Lettre à M. Dacier relative à l'alphabet des hiéroglyphes phonétiques|''Lettre à M. Dacier relative à l'alphabet des hiéroglyphes phonétiques'']] (Paris, 1822) -- at French Wikisource&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He had applied Young's approach to an obelisk inscribed in Greek and hieroglyphics and correlated sound values to individual glyphs by applying comparisons to the names [[Ptolemy]] and [[Cleopatra]]. An important assumption made by Champollion was that certain sounds (such as 't') could be represented by two glyphs, just as they are in English with different letters (such as the hard 'c' and 'k'). He then began to study other inscriptions, flush with this discovery.

==History==
Ross was born in [[Ukiah, California]] to Bill and Dorothy Ross and raised in [[Davis, California]]. He attended Jesuit High School in [[UC San Diego]], studied at the [[London School of Economics]], and the [[UC Hastings]] School of Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Member Detail|url=http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Member/Detail/173048|publisher=The State Bar of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked as senior legal counsel for the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computer company in [[Cupertino, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Edward Ross - Obituary|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/obits/michael-edward-ross/|website=davisenterprise.com|accessdate=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photography==
Ross had taken photographs for 27 years, and during the last eight years of his life used the [[Collodion process]] or wet-plates for his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hakala|first1=Kate|title=Meet One Photographer Who is Reviving the Extraordinary Art of Tintypes|url=http://www.nerve.com/art/meet-one-photographer-who-is-reviving-the-extraordinary-art-of-tintypes|website=Nerve.com|accessdate=2016-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ross worked with three different cameras: a half-plate box-style camera made by Ty Guillory, an {{convert|8|×|10|in}} bellows-style camera made by Black Art Woodcraft, and a {{convert|16|×|20|in}} Chamonix. He used 'period' lenses, manufactured between 1850 and 1900, by Dallmeyer, Voigtlander, and Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jane|first1=Katherine|title=The Quite Delightful Project|url=https://quitedelightfulproject.com/journal/ed-ross-interview-2/|website=quitedelightfulproject.com|accessdate=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NUDES AND PORTRAITS BY ED ROSS|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/news/erotica/nudes-and-portraits-by-ed-ross/|website=juxtapoz.com|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eles''' (also transliterated as ''Ellès'' and ''Al Las'') is a village in the [[Siliana Governorate]], Tunisia. It is located around  {{coord|35|56|55|N|9|5|50|E}} about 13&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Maktar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://itouchmap.com/?c=ts&amp;UF=-724841&amp;UN=-1027397&amp;DG=PPL Eles, Tunisia] at itouchmap.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymaphq.com/tunisia/el_kef/ellez.html Eles, Tunisia at citymap.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Siliana Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapmonde.org/africa/tunisia/gouvernorat-de-el-kef/ellez-852969/ Eles, Tunisia] at mapmondo.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eles, Tunisia sits over a natural spring at the base of the surrounding hills.

The village is notable for the large number of [[dolmen]]s found immediately to the west,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicorient.com/tunisia/elles.htm Description et photos du site d'Ellès (LookLex)]&lt;/ref&gt; thought to be from around 2500 BC.

In contrast Hoskin&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001:206-8&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Tunisian dolmen orientations can be explained by the local topography, in that the entrances all face downhill.

The local rock strata are geologically interesting as they provide a particularly good record of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary,&lt;ref&gt;Coccioni and Marsilia 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which is now better known as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].

During the [[Roman Empire]] and [[late antiquity]] there was a ''[[civitas]]'' (Roman town) called Ululi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1903.htm Titular Episcopal See of Ululi], at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2u08.html Ululensis] at catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

In archaeology, the '''Epipalaeolithic''' or '''Epipaleolithic''' (sometimes '''Epi-paleolithic''' etc.) is a term for a period intervening between the [[Upper Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] in the [[Stone Age]].  This position is also occupied by the [[Mesolithic]] and the two are sometimes confused, or used as synonyms.  More often they are used for different areas: [[Epipalaeolithic Near East|Epipaleolithic for the Levant]] ([[Middle East]] near the Mediterranean coast), and the [[Near East]] in general, as well as sometimes parts of Europe other than North and Western Europe, where Mesolithic is much more often used.  A Mesolithic period is not usually recognized for the [[Levant]] or Near East; in Europe a period categorized as Epipalaeolithic is followed by a Mesolithic one in the same area, and will itself be described as Mesolithic by many archaeologists. 

The Epipalaeolithic has been defined as the "final [[Upper Palaeolithic]] industries occurring at the end of the final [[Last glacial period|glaciation]] which appear to merge technologically into the [[Mesolithic]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bahn, Paul, ''The Penguin Archaeology Guide'', Penguin, London, pp. 141. {{ISBN|0-14-051448-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The period is generally dated from {{c.|20,000|lk=yes}}&amp;nbsp;[[Before Present|BP]] to 10,000&amp;nbsp;BP in the Levant,&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 46&lt;/ref&gt; but later in Europe.  If used as a synonym or equivalent for Mesolithic in Europe, it might end at about {{c.|5,000}}&amp;nbsp;BP or even later.

In the Levant the period may be subdivided into Early, Middle and Late Epipaleolithic, the last also being the [[Natufian culture|Natufian]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;  The preceding final Upper Paleolithic period is the [[Kebaran]] or "Upper Paleolithic Stage VI".&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 47-48&lt;/ref&gt;

Epipalaeolithic [[hunter-gatherer]]s, generally [[nomad]]ic, made relatively advanced tools from small [[flint]] or [[obsidian]] blades, known as [[microlith]]s, that were [[Hafting|hafted]] in wooden implements.  There are settlements with "flimsy structures", probably not [[Sedentism|permanently occupied]] except at some rich sites, but used and returned to seasonally.&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term usage ==
{{merge|Mesolithic#Terminology|date=May 2018}}
In describing the period before the start of the Neolithic, "Epipaleolithic" is typically used for cultures in regions that were far from the glaciers of the [[Last Glacial Maximum|Ice Age]], so that the retreat of the glaciers made a less dramatic change to conditions. This was the case in the [[Levant]].&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, 46-48; [http://search.eb.com/eb/article-10760 agriculture, origins of]. (2008). [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. Retrieved April 10, 2008, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the term "Mesolithic" is most likely to be used for Western Europe where climatic change and the extinction of the [[megafauna]] had a great impact of the paleolithic populations at the end of the Ice Age, creating post-glacial cultures such as the [[Azilian]], [[Sauveterrian]], [[Tardenoisian]], and [[Maglemosian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58234/Mesolithic-adaptations | title=History of Europe | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] online | access-date=8 April 2013 | quote=The Scandinavian Ice Sheet itself started to retreat northward about 8300&amp;nbsp;[[bce]], and the period between then and the origins of agriculture (at various times in the 7th to 4th [[millennia]], depending on location) was one of great environmental and cultural change. It is termed the [[Mesolithic Period]] ([[Middle Stone Age]]) to emphasize its transitional importance, but the alternative term Epipaleolithic, used mostly in [[eastern Europe]], stresses the continuity with processes begun earlier.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the past, French archaeologists had a general tendency to prefer the term "Epipaleolithic" to "Mesolithic", even for Western Europe.  Where "Epipaleolithic" is still used for Europe, it is generally for areas close to the [[Mediterranean]], as with the [[Azilian]] industry.  

"Epipalaeolithic" stresses the continuity with the Upper Paleolithic.  Alfonso Moure says in this respect:
{{quote|In the language of Prehistorical Archaeology, the most extended trend is to use the term "Epipaleolithic" for the industrial complexes of the post-glacial hunter-gatherer groups. Inversely, those that are in transitional ways towards artificial production of food are inscribed in the "Mesolithic".&lt;ref&gt;A. Moure ''El Origen del Hombre'', 1999. {{ISBN|84-7679-127-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Europe, the Epipalaeolithic may be regarded as a period preceding the Early Mesolithic,&lt;ref&gt;"...there are no sites defining the transition from the Epipalaeolithic Azilian to the Early Mesolithic" - p. 249, Thomas, Homer L., ''A Handbook of Archaeology: Cultures and Sites: North Africa, Egypt, Southwest Asia, Mediterranean, Northwest Europe, Northern Europe, ...'', Volume 1, 1996, Paul Astroms Forlag, {{ISBN|9170811229}}, 9789170811227 &lt;/ref&gt; or as locally constituting at least a part of it.  Other authors treat the Epipalaeolithic as part of the Late Palaeolithic;&lt;ref&gt;referring to the Azilian - Jones, Emily Lena, ''In Search of the Broad Spectrum Revolution in Paleolithic Southwest Europe'', pp. 5-6, 2015, Springer, {{ISBN|3319223518}}, 9783319223513, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RQS0CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; the culture in southern [[Portugal]] between about 10,500 to 8,500 years ago is "variously labelled as 'Terminal Magdalenian' and 'Epipalaeolithic{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Lawrence Guy, p. 310 in Bailey and Spikins&lt;/ref&gt; The different usages often reflect the degree of innovation and "economic intensification in the direction of domestication, [[sedentism]] or environmental modification" seen in the culture. If the Palaeolithic way of life continues with only adaptation to reflect changes in the types of wild food available, the culture may be called Epipalaeolithic.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Human Evolution and Prehistory'' (2nd Edition), eds. Eric Delson, Ian Tattersall, et al., p. 236, 2004, Routledge, {{ISBN|1135582289}}, 9781135582289, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6GFGsswTIO8C&amp;pg=PA236 google books] (quoted); Bailey and Spikins, 4&lt;/ref&gt; One writer, talking of Azilian [[microlith]]s in [[Vasco-Cantabria]] has "some exceptions that seem to herald the coming of 'true' Mesolithic technologies a few centuries later".&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Lawrence Guy, in Bailey and Spikins, 312&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the term==
{{main|Three-age system#The Epipaleolithic and Protoneolithic of Stjerna and Obermaier}}
The concept of the "Epipalaeolithic" arrived several decades after the main components of the [[three-age system]], the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic. It was first proposed in 1910 by the Swedish archaeologist, [[Knut Stjerna]], his initial example being a culture or sub-culture in Scandinavian archaeology,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stjerna|1910|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would not be often called Epipalaeolithic today. This left stone-lined pit graves containing implements of bone, such as harpoon and javelin heads. Stjerna observed that they "persisted during the recent Paleolithic period and also during the  Protoneolithic". Here he had used a new term, "Protoneolithic", which was according to him to be applied to the Danish [[Ertebølle culture|kitchen-middens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stjerna|1910|p=12}}: "... a persisté pendant la période paléolithique récente et même pendant la période protonéolithique."&lt;/ref&gt;  Stjerna also said that the eastern culture "is attached to the Paleolithic civilization" (''"se trouve rattachée à la civilisation paléolithique"''). However, it was not intermediary and of its intermediates he said "we cannot discuss them here" (''"nous ne pouvons pas examiner ici''"). This "attached" and non-transitional culture he chose to call the Epipaleolithic, defining it as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stjerna|1910|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;With Epipaleolithic I mean the period during the early days that followed the age of the reindeer, the one that retained Paleolithic customs. This period has two stages in Scandinavia, that of Maglemose and that of Kunda. (''Par époque épipaléolithique j'entends la période qui, pendant les premiers temps qui ont suivi l'âge du Renne, conserve les coutumes paléolithiques. Cette période présente deux étapes en Scandinavie, celle de Maglemose et de Kunda.'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stjerna made no mention of the Mesolithic, and it is unclear if he intended his terms to replace that.  His new terms were soon adopted by the German [[Hugo Obermaier]], who in 1916 used them in ''El Hombre fósil'' (translated into English in 1924) as part of an attack on the concept of the Mesolithic, which he insisted was a period of "transition" and an "interim" rather than "transformation":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Hugo | last=Obermaier | title=Fossil man in Spain | year=1924 | location=New Haven | publisher=Yale University Press | page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;But in my opinion this term is not justified, as it would be if these phases presented a natural evolutionary development – a progressive transformation from Paleolithic to Neolithic. In reality, the final phase of the [[Capsian]], the [[Tardenoisian]], the [[Azilian]] and the northern [[Maglemosian|Maglemose]] industries are the posthumous descendants of the Palaeolithic&amp;nbsp;...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This early history of the term introduced the ambiguity and degree of confusion which has continued to surround its use, as least as relates to the archaeology of Europe.

An '''eternity clause''' in the [[constitution]] or [[basic law]] of a country is a clause intended to ensure that the law or constitution cannot be changed by amendment. Eternity clauses are a type of [[entrenched clause]] in the constitutions of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech Republic]],&lt;ref name=CECEE/&gt; [[Constitution of Germany|Germany]], [[Constitution of Turkey|Turkey]], [[Constitution of Greece|Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf The official English language translation of the Greek Constitution as of May 27, 2008], Article 110 §1, p. 124, source: Hellenic Parliament, "The provisions of the Constitution shall be subject to revision with the exception of those which determine the form of government as a Parliamentary Republic and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7 , 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, 13 paragraph 1, and 26."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Italy|Italy]],&lt;ref name=weakcon&gt;{{cite book|title=Weak Constitutionalism: Democratic Legitimacy and the Question of Constituent Power (Routledge Research in Constitutional Law|author=Joel Colón-Ríos|isbn=978-0415671903|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TqqQAzH2zxEC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ac5BHQMPUf&amp;sig=W94bSY1hO-OioXESL7MR08Hp_gI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2012|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Constitution of Morocco|Morocco]],&lt;ref name=EWC/&gt; [[Constitution of Iran|the Islamic Republic of Iran]], [[Constitution of Brazil|the Federative Republic of Brazil]] and [[Constitution of Norway|Norway]].&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]] and the [[Constitution of Colombia]] contain similar provisions aimed at making it difficult, but not impossible, to change their basic structure.&lt;ref name=weakcon/&gt;

==Brazil==
Article 60 paragraph 4th of the [[Constitution of Brazil|Constitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil]], lists four subject areas of the Constitution that cannot be amended:&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Constituição brasileira de 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Federal form of the state; 
# direct, secret universal and periodic voting; 
# separation of powers; and 
# individual rights and guarantees.

There are other clauses that implicitly cannot be amended, mostly because they are dependent of the subjects above.

==Czech Republic==
The [[Czech Constitution]] contains an explicit eternity clause, whereby the [[Czech constitutional court]] assumes the role of ultimate arbiter of the effect of [[European law]] on the constitution.&lt;ref name=CECEE&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional Evolution in Central and Eastern Europe (Studies in Modern Law and Policy) |author=Kyriaki Topidi and Alexander H.E. Morawa|isbn=978-1409403272|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IhLKZKm7zGgC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6I3qdcCgv7&amp;sig=-N5b6wCU8dqfjiKGSAe1xWgxBmA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8LVJUP-bAYnb0QXhuoDQCA|year=2010|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
The German eternity clause (German: ''Ewigkeitsklausel'') is Article 79 paragraph (3) of the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]] (German: ''Grundgesetz''). The eternity clause establishes that certain fundamental principles of [[Germany]]'s democracy can never be removed, even by [[parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/304634/defending-german-democracy-andrew-stuttaford|title=Defending German Democracy|publisher=[[National Review]]|date=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental principles, (i.e., "the basic principles" of Articles 1 and 20), are as follows:

* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 1;
* '''Acknowledgement of human rights''': "The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Directly enforceable law''': "The following basic rights bind the legislature, the executive and judiciary as directly enforceable law." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Federal state''' ''(Länder)'': Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Social state''' (welfare state): Art. 20 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people by means of elections and voting and by specific legislative, executive and judicial organs." Art. 20 Para. (2);
* '''Rule of law''' (Rechtsstaat): "Legislation is subject to the constitutional order. The executive and judiciary are bound by the law." Art. 20 Para. (3);
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," each "bound by the law." Art. 20 Paras. (2) and (3).

The ''[[Parlamentarischer Rat]]'' (Parliamentary Council) included the eternity clause in its Basic Law specifically to prevent a new "legal" pathway to a dictatorship as was the case in the [[Weimar Republic]] with the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].&lt;ref name="iiea"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiea.com/publications/challenges-to-the-esm-treaty-and-the-fiscal-compact-treaty-before-the-german-constitutional-court|title=The Euro Crisis: Challenges to the ESM Treaty and the Fiscal Compact Treaty before the German Constitutional Court|publisher=[[Institute of International and European Affairs]]|date=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible for any political party, any legislation or any national commitment to violate "the basic principles" of "this Basic Law" laid down in Articles 1 and 20. Furthermore, the only way that Articles 1 and 20 can be removed is through Article 146, which requires "a constitution that is adopted by a free decision of the German People."&lt;ref name="iiea" /&gt;  So long as the principles of Articles 1 and 20 are retained, they may be amended (as Article 20 has indeed been amended to establish a 'right of resistance'), but the full protection of the eternity clause does not extend to such amendments.

Unlike the [[Weimar Constitution]], which made human rights only an objective, the eternity clause and Articles 1 and 20 make specific demands of "all state authority" regarding "human rights" (that is, "the basic rights" guaranteed in "this Basic Law") and have established specific [[Legislature|legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] organs in "the constitutional order" of "this Basic Law", each with separate functions bound by the [[law]]. These are "the basic principles" of the [[rule of law|democratic rule of law]] (German: ''[[Rechtsstaat]]'') and the [[separation of powers]], which are principles endorsed by three [[United Nations resolution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ruleoflaw/index.shtml|title=United Nations and the Rule of Law |publisher=Un.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|date=September 2018}}

==Greece==
The Greek eternity clause is Article 110 of the [[Constitution of Greece|Greek Constitution]]. This article states that every article of the [[Constitution of Greece|Constitution]] can be revised by the [[Hellenic Parliament|Parliament]], except of the fundemental ones, which establish [[Greece]] as a [[parliamentary republic]] and those of articles 2 paragraph 1, article 4 paragraphs 1, 4 and 7, article 5 paragraphs 1 and 3, article 13 paragraph 1 and article 26&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hellenicparliament.gr/UserFiles/f3c70a23-7696-49db-9148-f24dce6a27c8/001-156%20aggliko.pdf|title=Constitution of Greece in English|publisher= [[Hellenic Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These fundamental articles include:

* '''Republic''' (form of government): Art. 1 Para. (1);
* '''Sovereignty of the People''': "All state authority emanates from the People." Art. 1 Para. (2);
* '''Democratic''': "All state authority is exercised by the people, exist for the perople and the nation and are exercised as the Constitution suggests." Art. 1 Para. (3);
* '''Duty of all state authority''': "The dignity of man is inviolable. To respect and protect it is the duty of all state authority." Art. 2 Para. (1);
* '''Rule of law''': "Every Greek is equal to the law." Art. 4 Para. (1);
* '''About Public Function''': "Only Greek citizens are acceptable to all public functions, except of the exceptions in special laws." Art. 4 Para (4);
* '''About nobility titles''': "Noble or excellence titles are not given and not reconised on Greek citizens." Art. 4 Para (7);
* '''Acknowledgement of free personality''': "All people shall have the right to develop freely their personality and to participate in the social, economic and political life of the country, insofar as they do not infringe the rights of others or violate the Constitution and the good usages." Art. 5 Para (1);
* '''Personal Liberty''': "Personal liberty is inviolable. No one shall be prosecuted, arrested, imprisoned or otherwise confined except when and as the law provides." Art. 5 Para. (3);
* '''Freedom of Religion''': "Freedom of religious conscience is inviolable. The enjoyment of civil rights and liberties does not depend on the individual’s religious beliefs." Art. 13 Para. (1)
* '''Separation of powers''': "Specific legislative, executive and judicial organs," Art. 26;

==India==
The [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] has developed the [[basic structure doctrine]] which holds that certain features of the [[Constitution of India|constitution]] are fundamental in nature and cannot be modified through parliamentary amendment. The Supreme Court has yet to clearly delimit the components of the basic structure.

==Iran==
The final Article of the [[Constitution of Iran|Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], Art. 177, ensures that particular aspects of the Constitution are unalterable. These include the Islamic character of government and laws, the objectives of the republic, the democratic character of the government, “the absolute wilayat al-'amr and the leadership of the Ummah,” the administration of the country by referendum, and the official religion of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranchamber.com/government/laws/constitution_ch13.php The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morocco==
In the [[Constitution of Morocco]], eternity clauses exist that ensure certain provisions cannot be amended, including the role of [[Islam]] in the nation's law, and the role of the [[List of rulers of Morocco|King of Morocco]] in law.&lt;ref name=EWC&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Constitutions|author=Gerhard Robbers|isbn=978-0816060788|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3A-xgf1yM4C&amp;pg=PA626&amp;lpg=PA626&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YdnxLlYGpo&amp;sig=6JeZzSC2H1Ms2nzztB6w7F1N7H8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLNJULKMOYXL0AWJ6YHICw|year=2006|page=626}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''film producer''' is a person who oversees the production of a film.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.producersguild.org/?page=faq|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Producers Guild of America|website=www.producersguild.org|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either employed by a [[production company]] or working [[Independent film|independently]], producers plan and coordinate various aspects of film production, such as selecting the script; coordinating writing, directing, and editing; and arranging financing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://lfs.org.uk/full-time-study/ma-filmmaking/areas-study/producing|title=Producing |publisher= London Film School|website= lfs.org.uk |language =en|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "discovery stage," the producer finds and selects promising material for development.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Then, unless the film is based on an existing script, the producer has to hire a [[screenwriter]] and oversee the [[Filmmaking#Development|development of the script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onetonline.org/link/summary/27-2012.01|title=27-2012.01 - Producers|website=www.onetonline.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a script is completed, the producer will lead a [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] to secure the financial backing (a "[[Green-light|green light]]") to allow production to begin.

The producer also supervises the pre-production, production, and post-production stages of filmmaking. One of the most important tasks is to hire the [[Film director|director]] and other key crew members. Whereas the director makes the creative decisions during the production, the producer typically manages the logistics and business operations, though some directors also produce their own films. The producer is tasked with making sure the film is delivered on time and within budget,&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/job-profiles/tv-or-film-producer#|title=TV or film producer|website=nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the final say on creative decisions. Finally, the producer will oversee the marketing and [[Film distribution|distribution]].

For various reasons, producers cannot always supervise all of the production. In this case, the main producer may hire and delegate work to [[executive producer]]s, [[line producer]]s, or [[unit production manager]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt22"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/three-studios-agree-to-plan-to-certify-who-deserves-to-be-a-producer/|title=Three Studios Agree to Let a Guild Certify Credits for Film Producers|last=Cieply|first=Michael|date=8 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
===Development (film rights)===
During this stage of the production process, producers bring together people like the [[film director]], [[cinematographer]], and [[production designer]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/job_roles/757_producer|title=Producer|website=creativeskillset.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the film is supposed to be based on an original script, the producer has to find an appropriate [[screenwriter]].&lt;ref name="rottentomatoes.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/casino_royale/news/1648610/007_writers_to_tackle_quotbarbarellaquot/|title=writers Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have been hired to pen the screenplay for producer Dino de Laurentiis|accessdate=13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmmakers.com/artists/williamgoldman/biography/page2.htm|title=Goldman was contacted by director/producer Rob Reiner to write the screenplay|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If an existing script is considered flawed, they are able to order a new version or make the decision to hire a [[script doctor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidlynch.de/dunetimeout.html|title=He began work on the script.

More time and money spent in pre-production can reduce the time and money wasted during production time.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;

===Pre-production===
During production, the producer's job is to make sure the film stays on schedule and under budget.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; They will always be in contact with directors and other key creative team members.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt;&lt;ref name = bergan&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/30/bernd-eichinger-obituary|title=Bernd Eichinger [obituary]|quote =In 1979, Eichinger bought a large stake in the Munich-based production and distribution company Constantin Film, which he ran as a hands-on producer for over 30 years|last=Bergan|first=Ronald|work=The Guardian|location=London|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = europacorp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/the-movie-business-luc-besson-s-growing-empire-a-612371.html|title=Europacorp studio posted $186 million in revenues last year, making it second only to Germany's Constantin Film as Europe's largest independent studio|accessdate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, cast and [[film crew]] often work at different times or places, and certain films even require a [[second unit]]. The executive producer of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' original trilogy was [[George Lucas]] himself, the creator of the ''Star Wars'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucasfilm.com/inside/bio/georgelucas.html|title=Lucas continued the Star Wars saga as story writer and executive producer with The Empire Strikes Back in 1980 and Return of the Jedi in 1983.|accessdate=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040405085412/http://www.lucasfilm.com/inside/bio/georgelucas.html|archivedate=5 April 2004|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production===
For various reasons, producers cannot always personally supervise all parts of their production. For example, some producers run a company which also deals with film distribution.&lt;ref name = bergan/&gt;&lt;ref name = europacorp/&gt; Also, cast and [[film crew]] often work at different times and places, and certain films even require a [[second unit]].

===Post-production===
During post-production, the producer has the last word on whether sounds, music, or scenes have to be changed or cut. Even if the shooting has been finished, the producers can still demand that additional scenes be filmed. In the case of a negative [[test screening]], producers may even demand and get an alternative film ending. This happened, for example, with ''[[First Blood]].'' The test audience reacted very negatively when Rambo died, so the producers re-shot a new ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://davidmorrell.net/rambo-pages/david-morrell-on-rambo/|title=test audiences nearly rioted after cheering for Rambo and then seeing him die. So the producers went back to Hope, British Columbia, the location for the film, and shot a new ending in which Rambo lives|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, producers work with marketing and distribution companies in order to sell the film or arrange its distribution rights.&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;

==The union==
Within the industry, all of the producers union contracts are negotiated by [[Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers|The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP)]]. It was founded in 1924 by the U.S Trade Association as the Association of Motion Picture Producers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://collections.oscars.org/link/bio/1473|title = Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) records|website =Special Collections: Margaret Herrick Library |publisher = Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally created to only negotiate labor contracts, but during the mid-1930s they took over all contract negotiation responsibilities that were once controlled by the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  This alliance negotiates with a wide range of other associations when dealing with producers union contracts.

==Career process==
There are many different ways to become a film producer. [[Stanley Kramer]] started as an [[Film editing|editor]] and [[writer]], while other producers started as actors or directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/collections/stanley-kramer-collection|title=Mr. Kramer began his career in the 1930s as an editor and writer, later forming an independent production company|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most producers start in a college, university or film school. On the occasion of announcing his own film school, 'École de la Cité, film producer [[Luc Besson]] admitted that at the beginning of his career, he would have appreciated the chance to attend a film school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecoledelacite.com/en/|title=École de la cité|website=Ecole de la cité}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/luc-besson-launches-film-school-1118055818/|title=Luc Besson launches film school|work=Variety|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Film school]]s and many [[University|universities]] offer [[Academic degree|degree courses]] that include film production knowledge, with some courses that are especially designed for future film producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenacademyscotland.ac.uk/content-114|title=The MFA Advanced Film Practice programme aims to equip you with the creative, professional and technical knowledge you will need to enter the professional arena as a writer, producer or director.|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416155055/http://www.screenacademyscotland.ac.uk/content-114|archivedate=16 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazionecsc.it/context.jsp?ID_LINK=18&amp;area=7|title=The training course last three years and the interdisciplinary teaching programme prepares students in the specific areas of directing, scriptwriting, acting, photography, editing, sound techniques, production, set design, props and wardrobe|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These courses focus on key topics like [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]], [[script development]], script assessment, shooting schedule design, and budgeting.&lt;ref name="Filmakademie2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.filmakademie.de/en/studium/course-of-study/production/production/|title=Course of Study - Production |accessdate= |website = Filmakademie Baden Wurttemberg GmbH|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/schools/media/departments/photography|title=Our BA in Film Production is one of our most highly sought-after courses.|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130202000449/http://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/schools/media/departments/photography|archivedate=2 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dffb.de/html/en/studium/produktion|title=Producing seminars teach through practical studies in production, script development, budgeting, and media economics|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can also expect practical training regarding post-production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bfm.ee/programmes/film-arts/film-arts-ma/|title=All student films are developed, shot and post-produced in teams, closely mirroring a realistic industry work process in order to ease graduates' transitions to the professional environment|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training at a top producing school is one of the most efficient ways a student can show professionals they are not a rookie.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/becoming-a-producer-tried-and-tested-career-paths/|title=Becoming a Producer - Tried and Tested Career Paths|date=2015-06-12|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-US|newspaper=Student Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While education is one way to begin a career as a film producer, experience is also required to land a job. [[Internship]]s are a great way to gain experience while in school and give students a solid foundation on which to build their career. Many internships are paid, which enable students to earn money while gaining hands-on skills from industry professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-get-a-production-internship-1283507|title=Where to Look for Internship Programs in Entertainment|access-date=2017-02-03|newspaper=The Balance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://creativeskillset.org/creative_industries/film/ways_into_the_industry|title=Ways into the film industry - Film Industry - Creative Skillset|website=creativeskillset.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through internships, students get to network with people in the film industry as well. This pays off in the end when looking for jobs after school. Once an internship is over, the next step typically will be to land a junior position, such as a [[production assistant]].&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

Although rates can vary based on a producer's role and the location of filming, the average salary can start anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000, even doubling when working in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyfa.edu/student-resources/jobs-film-average-salary-career-paths/|title=Jobs in Film: Average Salary &amp; Career Paths|date=2014-12-01|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-US|newspaper=Student Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual salary for a producer in the U.S. is $109,844. When examining more than 15,000 producers in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, the average annual salary is $138,640.&lt;ref name="entertainment.howstuffworks.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/highest-paying-jobs-film-industry.htm#page=1|title=10 Highest Paying Jobs in the Film Industry|date=30 May 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers can also have an agreement to take a percentage of a movie's sales.&lt;ref name="entertainment.howstuffworks.com2" /&gt;

There is no average work day for a film producer, since their tasks are changing from day to day. A producer's work hours are often irregular and can consist of very long days with the possibility of working nights and weekends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prospects.ac.uk/job-profiles/television-film-video-producer|title=Television/film/video producer job profile {{!}} Prospects.ac.uk|website=www.prospects.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26079">[[File:Flaubert-Giraud.jpg|thumb|Flaubert at about the age of 50.  Portrait by [[Eugène Giraud]]]]
The '''letters of Gustave Flaubert''', the 19th-century French novelist, range in date from 1829, when he was 7 or 8 years old, to a day or two before his death in 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flaubert.univ-rouen.fr/jet/public/correspondance/feuilletage_liste_elts.php?t=C |title=Présentation des lettres par ordre chronologique |editor1-last=Leclerc |editor1-first=Yvan |editor2-last=Girard |editor2-first=Danielle |date=2 November 2017 |website=Correspondence: Édition électronique |publisher=Centre Flaubert, Université de Rouen |language=French |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are considered one of the finest bodies of letters in French literature, admired even by many who are critical of [[Gustave Flaubert|Flaubert]]'s novels.{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}  His main correspondents include family members, business associates and fellow-writers such as [[Théophile Gautier]], the [[Goncourt brothers]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], [[George Sand]], [[Ivan Turgenev]] and [[Émile Zola]].  They provide a valuable glimpse of his methods of work and his literary philosophy, as well as documenting his social life, political opinions, and increasing disgust with bourgeois society.

== Correspondents ==

4481 letters by Flaubert survive,{{sfn|Leclerc|Girard|2017}} a number which would have been considerably higher but for a series of burnings of his letters to his friends.  Many of those addressed to [[Maxime Du Camp]], [[Guy de Maupassant]] and [[Louis Bouilhet]] were destroyed in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Porter |first1=Laurence M. |last2=Gray |first2=Eugene F. |year=2002 |title=Gustave Flaubert's ''Madame Bovary'': A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T_BcAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22most+of+his+letters+to+and+from+his+close+friends%22&amp;dq=%22most+of+his+letters+to+and+from+his+close+friends%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiot9SCn87cAhXLyaQKHUWuCR8Q6AEIJzAA |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Greenwood Press |page=145 |isbn=0313319162 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From those that survive it appears that his principal correspondents were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flaubert.univ-rouen.fr/jet/public/correspondance/feuilletage_liste_elts.php?corpus=correspondance |title=Présentation des lettres par destinataire |editor1-last=Leclerc |editor1-first=Yvan |editor2-last=Girard |editor2-first=Danielle |date=2 November 2017 |website=Correspondence: Édition électronique |publisher=Centre Flaubert, Université de Rouen |language=French |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His family members:&lt;br/&gt;

== Themes ==

Flaubert's personality was rigorously excluded from his novels, but in the letters, written at night after the day's literary work was done, he expresses much more spontaneously his own personal views.{{sfn|Steegmuller|1954|p=11}}  Their themes often arise from his life as a reader and writer.  They discuss the subject-matter and structural difficulties of his novels, and explore the problems Flaubert faced in their composition, giving the reader a unique glimpse of his art in the making.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=76}}  They illustrate his extensive reading of the creative literatures of France, England (he loved [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lord Byron|Byron]] and [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]), Germany and the classical world; also his deep researches into history, philosophy and the sciences.{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}{{sfn|Barnes|2002|p=244}}  Above all, they constantly state and restate Flaubert's belief in the duty of the writer to maintain his independence, and in his own need to reach literary beauty through a quasi-scientific objectivity.{{sfn|Steegmuller|1954|pp=17–18}}{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=75}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hampshire |first=Stuart |author-link=Stuart Hampshire |date=16 December 1982 |title=In Flaubert's Laboratory |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/1982/12/16/in-flauberts-laboratory/ |work=The New York Review of Books |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

But his letters also demonstrate an enjoyment of the simple pleasures of Flaubert's youth.  Friendship, love, conversation, a delight in foreign travel, the pleasures of the table and of the bed are all in evidence.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=67}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vidal |first1=Gore |author-link1=Gore Vidal |year=1982 |title=Pink Triangle and Yellow Star, and Other Essays (1976–1982) |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xDQgAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22brothels+and+baths+of%22&amp;dq=%22brothels+and+baths+of%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjul5S1l8_cAhXIK8AKHR8tD68Q6AEIQzAF |location=London |publisher=Heinemann |page=29 |isbn=9780434830756 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These do not disappear in his maturer years, but they are offset by discussions of politics and current affairs which reveal an increasing disgust with society, especially bourgeois society, and with the age he lived in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lloyd |first1=Rosemary |year=2014 |orig-year=1990 |title=Madame Bovary |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0F4tBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=%22flaubert's+letters%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3jIb9hK3aAhVlKsAKHdNpAMY4FBDoAQg-MAU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22flaubert's%20letters%22&amp;f=false |location=Abingdon |publisher=Routledge |page=21 |isbn=9781138799349 |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}  They exude a sadness and a sense of having grown old before his time.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=80}}  As a whole, said the literary critic Eric Le Calvez, Flaubert's correspondence, "reveals his vision of life and of the relation between life and art: since the human condition is miserable, life can be legitimated only through an eternal pursuit of art."{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}

== Critical reception ==
[[File:Flaubert letter.jpg|thumb|An 1877 letter from [[Gustave Flaubert]] to [[Léon Cladel]]]]

For many years after the first publication of the letters critical opinion was divided.  [[Albert Thibaudet]] thought them "the expression of a first-rate intellect", and [[André Gide]] wrote that "For more than five years his correspondence took the place of the Bible at my bedside.  It was my reservoir of energy".  [[Frank Harris]] said that in his letters "he lets himself go and unconsciously paints himself for us to the life; and this Gustave Flaubert is enormously more interesting than anything in ''Madame Bovary''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harris |first1=Frank |author-link1=Frank Harris |year=1927 |title=Latest Contemporary Portraits |location=New York |publisher=Macaulay |page=206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand [[Marcel Proust]] found Flaubert's epistolary style "even worse" than that of his novels, while for [[Henry James]] the Flaubert of the letters was "impossible as a companion".{{sfn|Steegmuller|1982|pp=xvii–xviii}}

This ambivalence is a thing of the past, and there is now widespread agreement that the Flaubert correspondence is one of the finest in French literature.{{sfn|Le Calvez|2001|p=74}}  Publication of them "has crowned his reputation as the exemplary artist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780192806871.001.0001/acref-9780192806871-e-2807?rskey=3k4M21&amp;result=4 |title=The Oxford Companion to English Literature (7 ed.) |date=2009 |editor-last=Birch |editor-first=Dinah |editor-link=Dinah Birch |website=Oxford Reference |publisher=Oxford University Press |access-date=2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Enid Starkie]] wrote that Flaubert was one of his own greatest literary creations, and that the letters might well be seen in the future as his greatest book, and the one in which "he has most fully distilled his personality and his wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Starkie |first1=Enid |year=1971 |title=Flaubert the Master: A Critical and Biographical Study (1856-1880) |location=London |publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson |pages=355-356 |isbn=0297002260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], an inveterate enemy of Flaubert's novels, considered the letters a perfect example of pre-Freudian [[Free association (psychology)|free association]], and for [[Julian Barnes]] this description "hints at their fluency, profligacy, range and sexual frankness; to which we should add power, control, wit, emotion and furious intelligence.  The ''Correspondance''&lt;!--He is using the title of the French edition, hence the French spelling--&gt;...has always added up to Flaubert's best biography."{{sfn|Barnes|2002|p=239}}{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}  Rosemary Lloyd analyses the elements of their appeal as being "partly [their] wide sweep, partly the sense of seeing what Baudelaire called the strings and pulleys of the writer's workshop, and partly the immediacy of Flaubert's changeable, complex and challenging personality."  She continues, "Reading Flaubert's correspondence brings startlingly alive a man of enormous complexity, of remarkable appetites and debilitating lethargies, a knotted network of prejudices, insights, blind spots, passions and ambitions."{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|pp=67, 83}}

Charpentier }}  This four-volume edition was the first to try to collect Flaubert's letters.  The unnamed editor was Flaubert's niece Caroline Commanville; she censored the letters freely, cutting out many passages which she thought indecent or which referred unflatteringly to living persons, especially to herself, and very often failing to notify the reader of these cuts by the use of [[Ellipsis|ellipses]].  She also corrected his punctuation and sometimes "improved" his phrasing.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=68}}{{sfn|Steegmuller|1982|pp=xv–xvi}}{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}{{sfn|Cléroux|2013}}

This edition boasts an extremely thorough critical apparatus, with letters written to Flaubert, excerpts from the [[Goncourt Journal]] and other third-party documentation, together with explanatory and critical notes by the editor.  Julian Barnes points out that in the third volume the appendices, notes and variants take up more pages than the letters themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Barnes |first=Julian |date=14 March 2008 |title=The Lost Governess |url=https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/julian-barnes-gustave-flaubert/ |work=TLS |location=London |access-date=3 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Barnes|2003}}{{sfn|Cléroux|2013}}

'''Futurism''' ({{lang-it|Futurismo}}) was an [[Art movement|artistic]] and [[social movement]] that originated in [[Italy]] in the early 20th century. It emphasized speed, technology, youth, violence, and objects such as the car, the airplane, and the industrial city. Its key figures were the Italians [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Gino Severini]], [[Giacomo Balla]], and [[Luigi Russolo]]. It glorified modernity and aimed to liberate Italy from the weight of its past.&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=The 20th-Century art book|year=2001|publisher=Phaidon Press|location=dsdLondon|isbn=978-0714835426|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cubism]] contributed to the formation of Italian Futurism's artistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnason|last2=Harvard|first2=H.|last3=Mansfield|first3=Elizabeth|title=History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography|date=December 2012|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-0205259472|pages=189|edition=Seventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Important Futurist works included Marinetti's ''[[Manifesto of Futurism]]'', Boccioni's sculpture ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'', Balla's painting ''[[Abstract Speed + Sound]]'', and Russolo's ''[[The Art of Noises]]''. Although it was largely an [[Italians|Italian]] phenomenon, there were parallel movements in [[Russia]], [[England]], [[Belgium]] and elsewhere. The Futurists practiced in every medium of art, including painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, urban design, theatre, film, fashion, textiles, literature, music, architecture, and even [[Futurist meals]]. To some extent Futurism influenced the art movements [[Art Deco]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and to a greater degree [[Precisionism]], [[Rayonism]], and [[Vorticism]].

==Italian Futurism==
Futurism is an avant-garde movement founded in Milan in 1909 by the Italian poet [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]].&lt;ref name="20th-Century art book"/&gt;  Marinetti launched the movement in his ''[[Futurist Manifesto]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut28144gut Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''I manifesti del futurismo'', February 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; which he published for the first time on 5 February 1909 in ''La gazzetta dell'Emilia'', an article then reproduced in  the French daily newspaper ''[[Le Figaro]]'' on Saturday 20 February 1909.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k2883730/f1.image Le Figaro, ''Le Futurisme'', 1909/02/20 (Numéro 51)]. Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaai190904-01.2.3&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-futurism------ Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, ''Declaration of Futurism'', published in Poesia, Volume 5, Number 6, April 1909] (Futurist manifesto translated to English). Blue Mountain Project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy"&gt;[http://monoskop.org/images/7/73/Futurist_Aristocracy_1_1923.pdf Futurist Manifesto, reproduced in ''Futurist Aristocracy'', New York, April 1923]&lt;/ref&gt; He was soon joined by the painters [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Carlo Carrà]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Gino Severini]] and the composer [[Luigi Russolo]]. Marinetti expressed a passionate loathing of everything old, especially political and artistic tradition. "We want no part of it, the past", he wrote, "we the young and strong ''Futurists!''"  The Futurists admired [[speed]], [[technology]], youth and [[violence]], the car, the airplane and the industrial city, all that represented the technological triumph of humanity over [[nature]], and they were passionate nationalists. They repudiated the cult of the past and all imitation, praised originality, "however daring, however violent", bore proudly "the smear of madness", dismissed art critics as useless, rebelled against harmony and good taste, swept away all the themes and subjects of all previous art, and gloried in science.

Publishing manifestos was a feature of Futurism, and the Futurists (usually led or prompted by Marinetti) wrote them on many topics, including painting, architecture, religion, clothing and cooking.&lt;ref&gt;Umbro Apollonio (ed.), ''Futurist Manifestos'', MFA Publications, 2001 {{ISBN|978-0-87846-627-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding manifesto did not contain a positive artistic programme, which the Futurists attempted to create in their subsequent ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' (1914).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/imanifestidelfut00mariuoft I Manifesti del futurismo, lanciati da Marinetti, et al, 1914] (in Italian)&lt;/ref&gt;  This committed them to a "universal dynamism", which was to be directly represented in painting.  Objects in reality were not separate from one another or from their surroundings:  "The sixteen people around you in a rolling motor bus are in turn and at the same time one, ten four three; they are motionless and they change places.  ...  The motor bus rushes into the houses which it passes, and in their turn the houses throw themselves upon the motor bus and are blended with it."&lt;ref name=Tech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techpaint.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Futurist painters were slow to develop a distinctive style and subject matter. In 1910 and 1911 they used the techniques of [[Divisionism]], breaking light and color down into a field of stippled dots and stripes, which had been originally created by [[Giovanni Segantini]] and others.  Later, Severini, who lived in Paris, attributed their backwardness in style and method at this time to their distance from Paris, the centre of avant-garde art.&lt;ref&gt;Severini, G., ''The Life of a Painter'', Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-691-04419-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Severini was the first to come into contact with [[Cubism]] and following a visit to Paris in 1911 the Futurist painters adopted the methods of the Cubists.  Cubism offered them a means of analysing energy in paintings and expressing dynamism.

[[File:Umberto Boccioni 001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Umberto Boccioni]], sketch of ''[[The City Rises]]'' (1910)]]
They often painted modern urban scenes.  Carrà's ''[[The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli|Funeral of the Anarchist Galli]]'' (1910–11) is a large canvas representing events that the artist had himself been involved in, in 1904.  The action of a police attack and riot is rendered energetically with diagonals and broken planes.  His ''Leaving the Theatre'' (1910–11) uses a Divisionist technique to render isolated and faceless figures trudging home at night under street lights.

Boccioni's [[The City Rises (Boccioni)|''The City Rises'']]  (1910) represents scenes of construction and manual labour with a huge, rearing red horse in the centre foreground, which workmen struggle to control.  His ''States of Mind'', in three large panels, ''The Farewell'', ''Those who Go'', and ''Those Who Stay'', "made his first great statement of Futurist painting, bringing his interests in [[Bergson]], Cubism and the individual's complex experience of the modern world together in what has been described as one of the 'minor masterpieces' of early twentieth century painting."&lt;ref name=Humphreys&gt;Humphreys, R. ''Futurism'', Tate Gallery, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;  The work attempts to convey feelings and sensations experienced in time, using new means of expression, including "lines of force", which were intended to convey the directional tendencies of objects through space, "simultaneity", which combined memories, present impressions and anticipation of future events, and "emotional ambience" in which the artist seeks by intuition to link sympathies between the exterior scene and interior emotion.&lt;ref name=Humphreys/&gt;

Boccioni's intentions in art were strongly influenced by the ideas of Bergson, including the idea of [[Intuition (Bergson)|intuition]], which Bergson defined as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is unique and ineffable within it.  The Futurists aimed through their art thus to enable the viewer to apprehend the inner being of what they depicted.  Boccioni developed these ideas at length in his book, ''Pittura scultura Futuriste: Dinamismo plastico'' (''Futurist Painting Sculpture: Plastic Dynamism'') (1914).&lt;ref&gt;For detailed discussions of Boccioni's debt to Bergson, see Petrie, Brian, "Boccioni and Bergson", ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol. 116, No.852, March 1974, pp.140-147, and Antliff, Mark "The Fourth Dimension and Futurism: A Politicized Space", ''The Art Bulletin'', December 2000, pp.720-733.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Giacomo Balla, 1912, Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash, oil on canvas, 89.8 x 109.8 cm, Albright-Knox Art Gallery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Giacomo Balla]], 1912, ''[[Dinamismo di un Cane al Guinzaglio]]'' (''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash''), [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]]]]
Balla's ''Dynamism of a Dog on a Leash'' (1912) exemplifies the Futurists' insistence that the perceived world is in constant movement.  The painting depicts a dog whose legs, tail and leash&amp;nbsp;—and the feet of the woman walking it&amp;nbsp;—have been multiplied to a blur of movement.  It illustrates the precepts of the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting'' that, "On account of the persistency of an image upon the retina, moving objects constantly multiply themselves; their form changes like rapid vibrations, in their mad career.  Thus a running horse has not four legs, but twenty, and their movements are triangular."&lt;ref name=Tech/&gt;  His ''Rhythm of the Bow'' (1912) similarly depicts the movements of a violinist's hand and instrument, rendered in rapid strokes within a triangular frame.

The adoption of Cubism determined the style of much subsequent Futurist painting, which Boccioni and Severini in particular continued to render in the broken colors and short brush-strokes of divisionism.  But Futurist painting differed in both subject matter and treatment from the quiet and static Cubism of [[Picasso]], [[Braque]] and [[Juan Gris|Gris]]. Although there were Futurist portraits (e.g. Carrà's  ''Woman with Absinthe'' (1911),  Severini's ''Self-Portrait'' (1912), and Boccioni's  ''Matter'' (1912)), it was the urban scene and vehicles in motion that typified Futurist painting—e.g. Boccioni's ''[[The Street Enters the House]]'' (1911), Severini's ''Dynamic Hieroglyph of the Bal Tabarin'' (1912), and Russolo's ''Automobile at Speed'' (1913)

In 1912 and 1913, Boccioni turned to sculpture to translate into three dimensions his Futurist ideas.  In ''[[Unique Forms of Continuity in Space]]'' (1913) he attempted to realise the relationship between the object and its environment, which was central to his theory of "dynamism".  The sculpture represents a striding figure, cast in bronze posthumously and exhibited in the [[Tate Modern]]. (It now appears on the national side of [[Italian euro coins|Italian 20 eurocent coins]]). He explored the theme further in ''Synthesis of Human Dynamism'' (1912), ''Speeding Muscles'' (1913) and ''Spiral Expansion of Speeding Muscles'' (1913).  His ideas on sculpture were published in the ''Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/techsculpt.html |title=Technical Manifesto of Futurist Sculpture |publisher=Unknown.nu |date=1910-04-11 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1915 Balla also turned to sculpture making abstract "reconstructions", which were created out of various materials, were apparently moveable and even made noises.  He said that, after making twenty pictures in which he had studied the velocity of automobiles, he understood that "the single plane of the canvas did not permit the suggestion of the dynamic volume of speed in depth ... I felt the need to construct the first dynamic plastic complex with iron wires, cardboard planes, cloth and tissue paper, etc."&lt;ref name=MartinM&gt;Martin, Marianne W. ''Futurist Art and Theory'', Hacker Art Books, New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, personal quarrels and artistic differences between the Milan group, around Marinetti, Boccioni, and Balla, and the Florence group, around Carrà, [[Ardengo Soffici]] (1879–1964) and [[Giovanni Papini]] (1881–1956), created a rift in Italian Futurism.  The Florence group resented the dominance of Marinetti and Boccioni, whom they accused of trying to establish "an immobile church with an infallible creed", and each group dismissed the other as ''passéiste.''

Futurism had from the outset admired violence and was intensely patriotic.  The ''Futurist Manifesto'' had declared, "We will glorify war&amp;nbsp;—the world's only hygiene&amp;nbsp;—militarism, patriotism, the destructive gesture of freedom-bringers, beautiful ideas worth dying for, and scorn for woman."&lt;ref name="Futurist Aristocracy" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unknown.nu/futurism/manifesto.html |title=The Founding and Manifesto of Futurism |publisher=Unknown.nu |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it owed much of its character and some of its ideas to radical political movements, it was not much involved in politics until the autumn of 1913.&lt;ref name=MartinM/&gt;  Then, fearing the re-election of [[Giovanni Giolitti|Giolitti]], Marinetti published a political manifesto.  In 1914 the Futurists began to campaign actively against the [[Austro-Hungarian empire]], which still controlled some Italian territories, and Italian neutrality between the major powers. In September, Boccioni, seated in the balcony of the Teatro dal Verme in Milan, tore up an Austrian flag and threw it into the audience, while Marinetti waved an Italian flag.  When Italy entered the [[First World War]] in 1915, many Futurists enlisted.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Jerry, "Back to the Future", The New Yorker, September 6, 2004, p.103&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of the war marked several Futurists, particularly Marinetti, who fought in the mountains of Trentino at the border of Italy and Austria-Hungary, actively engaging in propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'The Futurist mountains': Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's experiences of mountain combat in the First World War|journal = Modern Italy|date = 2013-11-01|issn = 1353-2944|pages = 323–338|volume = 18|issue = 4|doi = 10.1080/13532944.2013.806289|first = Selena|last = Daly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combat experience also influenced Futurist music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Futurist War Noises: Confronting and Coping with the First World War|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fx1p115#page-1|website = California Italian Studies|accessdate = 2015-09-13|last = Daly|first = Selena}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outbreak of war disguised the fact that Italian Futurism had come to an end. The Florence group had formally acknowledged their withdrawal from the movement by the end of 1914.  Boccioni produced only one war picture and was killed in 1916.  Severini painted some significant war pictures in 1915 (e.g. ''War'', ''Armored Train'', and ''Red Cross Train''), but in Paris turned towards Cubism and post-war was associated with the [[Return to Order]].

After the war, Marinetti revived the movement.  This revival was called ''il secondo Futurismo'' (Second Futurism) by writers in the 1960s.  The art historian [[Giovanni Lista]] has classified Futurism by decades: "Plastic Dynamism" for the first decade, "Mechanical Art" for the 1920s, "Aeroaesthetics" for the 1930s.

==Russian Futurism==
{{main|Russian Futurism|Cubo-Futurism}}
[[File:Cyclist (Goncharova, 1913).jpg|thumb|[[Natalia Goncharova]], ''Cyclist'', 1913]]
Russian Futurism was a movement of literature and the visual arts. The poet [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] was a prominent member of the movement. Visual artists such as [[David Burlyuk]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Natalia Goncharova]] and [[Kazimir Malevich]] found inspiration in the imagery of Futurist writings and were poets themselves. It has also a larger impact on the all [[suprematism]] movement. Other poets adopting Futurism included [[Velimir Khlebnikov]] and [[Aleksey Kruchenykh]]. Poets and painters collaborated on theatre production such as the Futurist opera ''[[Victory Over the Sun]]'', with texts by Kruchenykh and sets by Malevich.

The main style of painting was [[Cubo-Futurism]], adopted in 1913 when [[Aristarkh Lentulov]] returned from Paris and exhibited his paintings in Moscow.  Cubo-Futurism combines the forms of [[Cubism]] with the representation of movement.  Like their Italian predecessors the Russian Futurists were fascinated with dynamism, speed and the restlessness of modern urban life.

The Russian Futurists sought controversy by repudiating the art of the past, saying that [[Pushkin]] and [[Dostoevsky]] should be "heaved overboard from the steamship of modernity". They acknowledged no authority and professed not to owe anything even to Marinetti, whose principles they had earlier adopted, obstructing him when he came to Russia to proselytize in 1914.

The movement began to decline after the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|revolution of 1917]]. Some Futurists died, others emigrated. Mayakovsky and Malevich became part of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] establishment and the [[Agitprop]] movement of the 1920s. Khlebnikov and others were persecuted. Mayakovsky committed suicide on April 14, 1930.

[[File:Casa Sant'Elia.jpg|thumb|An example of [[Futurist architecture]] by [[Antonio Sant'Elia]]]]

==Architecture==
{{further|Futurist architecture}}
The Futurist architect [[Antonio Sant'Elia]] expressed his ideas of modernity in his drawings for ''La Città Nuova'' (The New City) (1912–1914).  This project was never built and Sant'Elia was killed in the First World War, but his ideas influenced later generations of architects and artists.  The city was a backdrop onto which the dynamism of Futurist life is projected.  The city had replaced the landscape as the setting for the exciting modern life.  Sant'Elia aimed to create a city as an efficient, fast-paced machine.  He manipulates light and shape to emphasize the sculptural quality of his projects. Baroque curves and encrustations had been stripped away to reveal the essential lines of forms unprecedented from their simplicity.  In the new city, every aspect of life was to be rationalized and centralized into one great powerhouse of energy.  The city was not meant to last, and each subsequent generation was expected to build their own city rather than inheriting the architecture of the past.

Futurist architects were sometimes at odds with the Fascist state's tendency towards [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]]-classical aesthetic patterns. Nevertheless, several Futurist buildings were built in the years 1920–1940, including public buildings such as railway stations, maritime resorts and [[post office]]s.  Examples of Futurist buildings still in use today are [[Trento]]'s railway station, built by [[Angiolo Mazzoni]], and the [[Firenze Santa Maria Novella railway station|Santa Maria Novella station]] in [[Florence]].  The Florence station was designed in 1932 by the ''Gruppo Toscano'' (Tuscan Group) of architects, which included [[Giovanni Michelucci]] and [[Italo Gamberini]], with contributions by Mazzoni.

==Music==
{{main|Futurism (music)}}
Futurist music rejected tradition and introduced experimental sounds inspired by machinery, and would influence several 20th-century composers.

[[Francesco Balilla Pratella]] joined the Futurist movement in 1910 and wrote a ''Manifesto of Futurist Musicians'' in which he appealed to the young (as had Marinetti), because only they could understand what he had to say. According to Pratella, Italian music was inferior to music abroad. He praised the "sublime genius" of [[Wagner]] and saw some value in the work of other contemporary composers, for example [[Richard Strauss]], [[Elgar]], [[Mussorgsky]], and [[Sibelius]]. By contrast, the Italian [[symphony]] was dominated by [[opera]] in an "absurd and anti-musical form". The [[College or university school of music|conservatories]] was said to encourage backwardness and mediocrity. The publishers perpetuated mediocrity and the domination of music by the "rickety and vulgar" operas of [[Puccini]] and [[Umberto Giordano]]. The only Italian Pratella could praise was his teacher [[Pietro Mascagni]], because he had rebelled against the publishers and attempted innovation in opera, but even Mascagni was too traditional for Pratella's tastes. In the face of this mediocrity and conservatism, Pratella unfurled "the red flag of Futurism, calling to its flaming symbol such young composers as have hearts to love and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice."

[[Luigi Russolo]] (1885–1947) wrote ''[[The Art of Noises]]'' (1913),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Russolo |first=Luigi |url=http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |title=The Art of Noises on Theremin Vox |publisher=Thereminvox.com |date=2004-02-22 |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607122724/http://www.thereminvox.com/article/articleview/117 |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html The Art of Noises] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929094533/http://www.obsolete.com/120_years/machines/futurist/art_of_noise.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an influential text in 20th-century musical aesthetics. Russolo used instruments he called ''[[intonarumori]]'', which were [[Musical acoustics|acoustic]] [[noise]] generators that permitted the performer to create and control the [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] and [[pitch (music)|pitch]] of several different types of noises. Russolo and Marinetti gave the first concert of Futurist music, complete with ''intonarumori'', in 1914. However they were prevented from performing in many major European cities by the outbreak of war.

Futurism was one of several 20th-century movements in art music that paid homage to, included or imitated machines. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] has been seen as anticipating some Futurist ideas, though he remained wedded to tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/papers/lombardi.html |title=Daniele Lombardi in ''Futurism and Musical Notes'' |publisher=Ubu.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russolo's ''intonarumori'' influenced [[Stravinsky]], [[Arthur Honegger]], [[George Antheil]], [[Edgar Varèse]],&lt;ref name="Humphreys"/&gt; [[Stockhausen]] and [[John Cage]]. In [[Pacific 231]], Honegger imitated the sound of a steam locomotive. There are also Futurist elements in [[Prokofiev]]'s ''The Steel Step'' and in his Second Symphony.

Most notable in this respect, however, is the American [[George Antheil]]. His fascination with machinery is evident in his ''Airplane Sonata'', ''Death of the Machines'', and the 30-minute ''[[Ballet Mécanique]]''. The ''Ballet Mécanique'' was originally intended to accompany an experimental film by [[Fernand Léger]], but the musical score is twice the length of the film and now stands alone. The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three [[xylophones]], four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two "live pianists", and sixteen synchronized player pianos. Antheil's piece was the first to synchronize machines with human players and to exploit the difference between what machines and humans can play.

Other composers offered more melodic variants of Futurist music, notably [[Franco Casavola]], who was active with the movement at the invitation of Marinetti between 1924 and 1927, and [[Arthur-Vincent Lourié]], the first Russian Futurist musician, and a signatory of the St Petersburg Futurist Manifesto in 1914. His five ''Synthèses'' offer a form of dodecaphony, while ''Formes en l'air'' was dedicated to Picasso and is a Cubo-Futurist concept. Born in Ukraine and raised in New York, [[Leo Ornstein]] gave his first recital of 'Futurist Music' at the Steinway Hall in London on 27 March 1914. According to the [[Daily Sketch]] newspaper ''"one listened with considerable distress. Nothing so horrible as Mr Ornstein's music has been heard so far. Sufferers from complete deafness should attend the next recital."''

==Dance==
The Futuristic movement also influenced the concept of dance. Indeed, dancing was interpreted as an alternative way of expressing man's ultimate fusion with the machine.  The altitude of a flying plane, the power of a car's motor and the roaring loud sounds of complex machinery were all signs of man's intelligence and excellence which the art of dance had to emphasize and praise. This type of dance is considered futuristic since it disrupts the referential system of traditional, classical dance and introduces a different style, new to the sophisticated bourgeois audience.  The dancer no longer performs a story, a clear content, that can be read according to the rules of ballet. One of the most famous futuristic dancers was the Italian {{Ill|Giannina Censi|it}}. Trained as a classical ballerina, she is known for her "Aerodanze" and continued to earn her living by performing in classical and popular productions. She describes this innovative form of dance as the result of a deep collaboration with Marinetti and his poetry. Through these words, she explains: " I launched this idea of the aerial-futurist poetry with Marinetti, he himself declaiming the poetry. A small stage of a few square meters;... I made myself a satin costume with a helmet; everything that the plane did had to be expressed by my body. It flew and, moreover, it gave the impression of these wings that trembled, of the apparatus that trembled,... And the face had to express what the pilot felt."&lt;ref&gt;Klöck, A. (1999) ''Of Cyborg Technologies and Fascistized Mermaids: Giannina Censi’s ‘Aerodanze’ in 1930s Italy'', Theatre Journal 51(4): 395–415&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rem.routledge.com/articles/overview/futurism Juliet Bellow, ''Futurism and Dance'', Routledge Encyclopedia of Modernism, 305], American University, 09/05/2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
{{main|Futurism (literature)}}
Futurism as a literary movement made its official debut with F.T. Marinetti's ''[[Futurist Manifesto|Manifesto of Futurism]]'' (1909), as it delineated the various ideals Futurist poetry should strive for. Poetry, the predominate medium of Futurist literature, can be characterized by its unexpected combinations of images and hyper-conciseness (not to be confused with the actual length of the poem).  The Futurists called their style of poetry ''parole in libertà'' (word autonomy) in which all ideas of meter were rejected and the word became the main unit of concern. In this way, the Futurists managed to create a new language free of syntax punctuation, and metrics that allowed for free expression.

Theater also has an important place within the Futurist universe. Works in this genre have scenes that are few sentences long, have an emphasis on nonsensical humor, and attempt to discredit the deep rooted traditions via parody and other devaluation techniques.
There are a number of examples of Futurist novels from both the initial period of Futurism and the neo-Futurist period, from Marinetti himself to a number of lesser known Futurists, such as  Primo Conti, Ardengo Soffici and Giordano Bruno Sanzin (''Zig Zag, Il Romanzo Futurista'' edited by Alessandro Masi, 1995). They are very diverse in style, with very little recourse to the characteristics of Futurist Poetry, such as 'parole in libertà'. Arnaldo Ginna's 'Le ''locomotive con le calze'''(Trains with socks on)plunges into a world of absurd nonsense, childishly crude. His brother Bruno Corra wrote in ''Sam Dunn è morto'' (Sam Dunn is Dead) a masterpiece of Futurist fiction, in a genre he himself called 'Synthetic' characterized by compression, and precision; it is a sophisticated piece that rises above the other novels through the strength and pervasiveness of its irony.

[[File:Blast2.jpg|thumb|The cover of the last edition of ''[[BLAST (magazine)|BLAST]]'', the [[literary magazine]] of the British [[Vorticist]] movement, a movement heavily influenced by Futurism]]
Many Italian Futurists supported [[Fascism]] in the hope of modernizing a country divided between the industrialising north and the rural, archaic South. Like the Fascists, the Futurists were Italian nationalists, radicals, admirers of violence, and were opposed to parliamentary democracy. Marinetti founded the Futurist Political Party (''Partito Politico Futurista'') in early 1918, which was absorbed into [[Benito Mussolini]]'s ''[[Fasci di combattimento]]'' in 1919, making Marinetti one of the first members of the [[National Fascist Party]]. He opposed Fascism's later exaltation of existing institutions, calling them "reactionary", and walked out of the 1920 Fascist party congress in disgust, withdrawing from politics for three years; but he supported Italian Fascism until his death in 1944. The Futurists' association with Fascism after its triumph in 1922 brought them official acceptance in Italy and the ability to carry out important work, especially in [[architecture]]. After the [[Second World War]], many Futurist artists had difficulty in their careers because of their association with a defeated and discredited regime.

Marinetti sought to make Futurism the official state art of Fascist Italy but failed to do so.  Mussolini chose to give patronage to numerous styles and movements in order to keep artists loyal to the regime. Opening the exhibition of art by the [[Novecento Italiano]] group in 1923, he said, "I declare that it is far from my idea to encourage anything like a state art.  Art belongs to the domain of the individual.  The state has only one duty: not to undermine art, to provide humane conditions for artists, to encourage them from the artistic and national point of view."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Braun, Emily, ''Mario Sironi and Italian Modernism: Art and Politics under Fascism'', Cambridge University Press, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  Mussolini's mistress, [[Margherita Sarfatti]], who was as able a cultural entrepreneur as Marinetti, successfully promoted the rival Novecento group, and even persuaded Marinetti to sit on its board.  Although in the early years of Italian Fascism modern art was tolerated and even embraced, towards the end of the 1930s, right-wing Fascists introduced the concept of "[[degenerate art]]" from Germany to Italy and condemned Futurism.

Marinetti made numerous moves to ingratiate himself with the regime, becoming less radical and avant-garde with each.  He moved from Milan to Rome to be nearer the centre of things.  He became an academician despite his condemnation of academies, married despite his condemnation of marriage, promoted religious art after the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 and even reconciled himself to the Catholic Church, declaring that Jesus was a Futurist.

[[File:Arnaldo Dell'Ira (1903-1943), lampada a grattacielo, 1929.jpg|thumb|An example of Futurist design: "Skyscraper Lamp", by the Italian architect [[Arnaldo dell'Ira]], 1929]]
Although Futurism mostly became identified with Fascism, it had leftist and anti-Fascist supporters.  They tended to oppose Marinetti's artistic and political direction of the movement, and in 1924 the socialists, communists and anarchists walked out of the Milan Futurist Congress. The anti-Fascist voices in Futurism were not completely silenced until the annexation of [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and the Italo-German [[Pact of Steel]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Berghaus, Günther, "New Research on Futurism and its Relations with the Fascist Regime", ''Journal of Contemporary History'', 2007, Vol. 42, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;  This association of Fascists, socialists and anarchists in the Futurist movement, which may seem odd today, can be understood in terms of the influence of [[Georges Sorel]], whose ideas about the regenerative effect of political violence had adherents right across the political spectrum.

Futurism expanded to encompass many artistic domains and ultimately included painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphic design, industrial design, interior design, theatre design, textiles, drama, literature, music and architecture.

===Aeropainting===
{{main|Aeropittura}}
Aeropainting (''aeropittura'') was a major expression of the second generation of Futurism beginning in 1926.  The technology and excitement of flight, directly experienced by most aeropainters,&lt;ref name=Osborn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |title=Osborn, Bob, ''Tullio Crali: the Ultimate Futurist Aeropainter'' |publisher=Simultaneita.net |date= |accessdate=2011-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207090815/http://www.simultaneita.net/tulliocrali.html |archivedate=2010-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; offered aeroplanes and [[aerial landscape art|aerial landscape]] as new subject matter.  Aeropainting was varied in subject matter and treatment, including realism (especially in works of propaganda), abstraction, dynamism, quiet Umbrian landscapes,&lt;ref&gt;" ... dal realismo esasperato e compiaciuto (in particolare delle opere propagandistiche) alle forme asatratte (come in Dottori: ''Trittico della velocità''), dal dinamismo alle quieti lontane dei paesaggi umbri di Dottori ... ." ''L'aeropittura futurista'' http://users.libero.it/macbusc/id22.htm&lt;/ref&gt; portraits of Mussolini (e.g. Dottori's ''Portrait of il Duce''), devotional religious paintings, decorative art, and pictures of planes.

Aeropainting was launched in a manifesto of 1929, ''Perspectives of Flight'', signed by [[Benedetta]], [[Depero]], [[Gerardo Dottori|Dottori]], [[Fillìa]], Marinetti, [[Enrico Prampolini|Prampolini]], [[Somenzi]] and [[:it:Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)|Tato (Guglielmo Sansoni)]]. The artists stated that  "The changing perspectives of flight constitute an absolutely new reality that has nothing in common with the reality traditionally constituted by a terrestrial perspective" and that "Painting from this new reality requires a profound contempt for detail and a need to synthesise and transfigure everything." Crispolti identifies three main "positions" in aeropainting: "a vision of cosmic projection, at its most typical in Prampolini's 'cosmic idealism'  ... ; a 'reverie' of aerial fantasies sometimes verging on fairy-tale (for example in Dottori ...); and a kind of aeronautical documentarism that comes dizzyingly close to direct celebration of machinery (particularly in [[Tullio Crali|Crali]], but also in Tato and Ambrosi)."&lt;ref&gt;Crispolti, E., "Aeropainting", in Hulten, P., ''Futurism and Futurisms'', Thames and Hudson, 1986, p.413&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually there were over a hundred aeropainters.  Major figures include [[Fortunato Depero]], [[Enrico Prampolini]], [[Gerardo Dottori]] and Crali. Crali continued to produce ''aeropittura'' up until the 1980s.

==Legacy==
Futurism influenced many other twentieth-century art movements, including [[Art Deco]], [[Vorticism]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Dada]], and much later [[Neo-Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hal Foster, Neo-Futurism. Published by: Architectural Association School of Architecture https://www.jstor.org/stable/29543561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pinkus, ''Self-Representation in NeoFuturism and Punk''. Published by: The Johns Hopkins University Press https://www.jstor.org/stable/3190376&lt;/ref&gt; Futurism as a coherent and organized artistic movement is now regarded as extinct, having died out in 1944 with the death of its leader Marinetti.

Nonetheless, the ideals of Futurism remain as significant components of modern [[Western culture]]; the emphasis on youth, speed, power and technology finding expression in much of modern commercial cinema and culture. [[Ridley Scott]] consciously evoked the designs of [[Antonio Sant'Elia|Sant'Elia]] in ''[[Blade Runner]]''. Echoes of Marinetti's thought, especially his "dreamt-of metallization of the human body", are still strongly prevalent in Japanese culture, and surface in [[manga]]/[[anime]] and the works of artists such as [[Shinya Tsukamoto]], director of the ''Tetsuo'' (lit. "Ironman") films. Futurism has produced several reactions, including the literary genre of [[cyberpunk]]—in which technology was often treated with a critical eye—whilst artists who came to prominence during the first flush of the [[Internet]], such as [[Stelarc]] and [[Mariko Mori]], produce work which comments on Futurist ideals. and the art and architecture movement Neo-Futurism in which technology is considered a driver to a better quality of life and sustainability values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/architecture/all/18509/facts.yes_is_more_an_archicomic_on_architectural_evolution.htm Yes is More.

A revival of sorts of the Futurist movement in theatre began in 1988 with the creation of the [[Neo-Futurist]] style in Chicago, which utilizes Futurism's focus on speed and brevity to create a new form of immediate theatre. Currently, there are active Neo-Futurist troupes in [[Chicago]], [[New York City|New York]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/neofuturists-tml-twenty-five-years-history-anniversary/Content?oid=11871597 |title=Too Much Light at 25: An oral history |last1=Potter |first1=Janet |date=16 December 2013 |website=Reader |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gullah''', also called '''Sea Island Creole English'''&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt; and '''Geechee''', is a [[creole language]] spoken by the [[Gullah]] people (also called "Geechees" within the community), an [[African-American]] population living in coastal regions of the American states of [[South Carolina Lowcountry|South Carolina]] and [[Golden Isles of Georgia|Georgia]] (including urban Charleston and Savannah), as well as northeasternmost [[Florida]]. Closely related varieties are spoken in the Bahamas, namely [[Bahamian Creole]].&lt;ref name="Glottolog" /&gt;

The Gullah language is based on different varieties of [[English language|English]] and languages of [[West Africa|West]] and [[Central Africa]].

==Origins==
Scholars have proposed a number of theories about the origins of Gullah and its development:
# Gullah developed independently on the Sea Islands off the coast of the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida throughout the 18th and 19th centuries among enslaved Africans. They developed a language that combined grammatical,  phonological, and lexical features of the non-standard English varieties spoken by white slaveholders and farmers in that region of the United States along with those from numerous Western and Central African languages. According to this view, Gullah developed separately, or distinctly, from African American English and varieties of English spoken in the South.
# Some enslaved Africans spoke a [[West African Pidgin English|Guinea Coast Creole English]] (also called West African Pidgin English) before being forcibly relocated to the Americas. Guinea Coast Creole English was one of many languages spoken along the West African coast during the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries as a language of trade between Europeans and Africans and among multilingual Africans. It seems to have been prevalent in British coastal slave trading centers such as [[James Island (The Gambia)|James Island]], [[Bunce Island]], [[Elmina Castle]], [[Cape Coast Castle]] and [[Anomabu]]. This theory of Gullah's origins and development follows the [[Creole language#Monogenetic theory of pidgins and creoles|monogenetic theory]] of creole development and the [[Creole language#Domestic origin hypothesis|domestic origin hypothesis]] of English-based creoles.

The vocabulary of Gullah comes primarily from English, but there are numerous words of African origin for which scholars have yet to produce detailed etymologies. Some of these African [[loanwords]] are: ''cootuh'' ("[[Pseudemys|turtle]]"), ''oonuh'' ("you [plural]"), ''nyam'' ("eat"), ''buckruh'' ("white man"), ''pojo'' ("[[heron]]"), ''swonguh'' ("proud") and ''benne'' ("[[sesame]]").

==Related languages==
Gullah resembles other English-based creole languages spoken in West Africa and the Caribbean Basin. These include the [[Krio language]] of [[Sierra Leone]], [[Jamaican Patois]], [[Bajan Creole]], [[Trinidadian Creole]], [[Tobagonian Creole]], [[Guyanese Creole]], and [[Belizean Kriol language|Belizean Kriol]]. It is speculated{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} that these languages use English as a lexifier (i.e., their vocabularies are derived largely from English), and that their syntax (sentence structure) is strongly influenced by African languages; but research by [[Salikoko Mufwene]] and others suggests that non-standard Englishes may have also influenced Gullah's (and other creoles') syntactical features.

Gullah is most closely related to [[Afro-Seminole Creole]], spoken in scattered [[Black Seminole]] communities in Oklahoma, Texas, and Northern Mexico. The Black Seminoles' ancestors were Gullahs who escaped from slavery in coastal South Carolina and Georgia in the 18th and 19th centuries and fled into the Florida wilderness. They emigrated from Florida after the [[Second Seminole War]] (1835–42). Their modern descendants in the West speak a conservative form of Gullah resembling the language of 19th-century plantation slaves.

There is debate amongst linguists concerning the relationship between Gullah and [[African-American English]] (AAE). There are some that postulate a Gullah-like "plantation creole" as having been the origin of AAE. Others cite different British dialects of English as having had greater influence on the structure of AAE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Weldon |first=Tracey L. |last2=Moody |first2=Simanique |date=July 2015 |title=The Place of Gullah in the African American Linguistic Continuum |url=http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199795390.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199795390-e-27 |journal=The Oxford Handbook of African American Language |volume= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turner's research==
In the 1930s and 1940s the African-American [[linguist]] [[Lorenzo Dow Turner]] did a seminal study of the Gullah language based on field research in rural communities in coastal South Carolina and Georgia. Turner found that Gullah is strongly influenced by African languages in its sound system, vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, and semantics. Turner identified over 300 [[loanword]]s from various [[languages of Africa|African languages]] in Gullah and almost 4,000 African personal names used by Gullah people. He also found Gullahs living in remote seaside settlements who could recite songs and story fragments and do simple counting in the [[Mende language|Mende]], [[Vai language|Vai]] and [[Fulani]] languages of West Africa.

In 1949, Turner published his findings in a classic work called ''Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect'' ({{ISBN|978-1570034527}}). The fourth edition of this book was reprinted with a new introduction in 2002.

Before Turner's work, mainstream scholars viewed Gullah speech as substandard English, a hodgepodge of mispronounced words and corrupted grammar, which uneducated black people developed in their efforts to copy the speech of their English, Irish, Scottish and French [[Huguenot]] slave owners.&lt;ref name="Mille and Montgomery"&gt;Mill and Montgomery, "Introduction to Africanisms in the Gullah Dialect by Lorenzo Turner", xix–xxiv, Gonzales, ''The Black Border: Gullah Stories of the Carolina Coast'', p. 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner's study was so well researched and detailed in its evidence of African influences in Gullah that academics soon changed their minds.  After Turner's book was published in 1949, scholars began coming to the Gullah region regularly to study African influences in Gullah language and culture.

==Grammar==

===Morphology===
The following sentences illustrate the basic verb tense and aspect system in Gullah:
:''Uh he'p dem'' — "I help them/I helped them" ('''Present/Past Tense''')
:''Uh bin he'p dem'' — "I helped them" (past tense) [I've been helping them]
:''Uh gwine he'p dem'' — "I will help them" (future tense) [I'm going to help them]
:''Uh done he'p dem'' — "I have helped them" (perfect tense) [I've done helped them]
:''Uh duh he'p dem'' — "I am helping them" (present continuous) [I do help them]
:''Uh binnuh he'p dem'' — "I was helping them" (past continuous) [I've been helping them]

===Syntax===
These sentences illustrate 19th-century Gullah speech:
:''Da' big dog, 'e bite'um'' — "That big dog, it bit him" (topicalization)
:''Duh him da' cry out so'' — "It is he who cried out that way" (front focusing)
:''Uh tell'um say da' dog fuh bite'um'' — "I told him, said that dog would bite him" (dependent clauses with "say")
:''De dog run, gone, bite'um'' — "The dog ran, went, bit him" (serial verb construction)
:''Da' duh big big dog'' — "That is a big, big dog" (reduplication)

==Storytelling==
The Gullah people have a rich storytelling tradition strongly influenced by African oral traditions but also by their historical experience in America. Their stories include animal [[trickster]] tales about the antics of [[Br'er Rabbit|"Brer Rabbit"]], [[Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear|"Brer Fox" and "Brer Bear"]], [[Big Bad Wolf (Disney)|"Brer Wolf"]], etc.; human trickster tales about clever and self-assertive slaves; and morality tales designed to impart moral teaching to children.

Several white American writers collected Gullah stories in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The best collections were made by [[Charles Colcock Jones, Jr.]] from Georgia and Albert Henry Stoddard from South Carolina. Jones (a Confederate officer during the Civil War) and Stoddard were both [[Planter class|planter-class]] whites who grew up speaking Gullah with the slaves (and later, freedmen) on their families' plantations. Another collection was made by [[Abigail Christensen]], a Northern woman whose parents came to the Lowcountry after the Civil War to assist the newly freed slaves. [[Ambrose E. Gonzales]], another writer of South Carolina planter-class background, also wrote original stories in 19th-century Gullah, based on Gullah literary forms. Gonzales' works are well remembered in South Carolina today.

The linguistic accuracy of these writings has been questioned because of the authors' social backgrounds. Nonetheless, these works provide the best available information on the Gullah language as it was spoken in its more conservative form during the 19th century.

==Today==
Gullah is spoken by about 250,000 people in [[South Carolina Low Country|coastal South Carolina]] and [[Golden Isles of Georgia|Georgia]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Although some scholars argue that Gullah has changed little since the 19th century and that most speakers have always been bilingual, it is likely that at least some [[decreolization]] has taken place. In other words, some African-influenced grammatical structures that were present a century ago are less prevalent in the language today. Nonetheless, Gullah is still understood as a creole language and is certainly distinct from Standard American English.

For generations, outsiders [[social stigma|stigmatized]] Gullah speakers, by regarding their language as a mark of ignorance and low social status. As a result, [[Gullah]] people developed the habit of speaking their language only within the confines of their own homes and local communities. That causes difficulty in enumerating speakers and assessing decreolization. It was not used in public situations outside the safety of their home areas, and many speakers experienced discrimination even within the Gullah community. Some speculate that the prejudice of outsiders may have helped to maintain the language.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Others suggest that a kind of valorization or "covert prestige"&lt;ref&gt;Labov, W. (1966). The Social Stratification of English in New York City. Center for Applied Linguistics, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; remained for many community members and that the complex pride has insulated the language from obliteration.

[[US Supreme Court]] Justice [[Clarence Thomas]] was raised as a Gullah speaker in coastal Georgia. When asked why he has little to say during hearings of the court, he told a [[high school]] student that the ridicule he received for his Gullah speech, as a young man, caused him to develop the habit of listening rather than speaking in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/politics/14TWOR.html |title=In His Own Words: Justice Clarence Thomas |date=December 14, 2000 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas's English-speaking grandfather raised him after the age of six in Savannah.&lt;ref name="Toobin"&gt;Jeffrey Toobin, ''The Nine,'' Doubleday 2007, at 106&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years educated Gullah people have begun promoting use of Gullah openly as a symbol of cultural pride. In 2005, Gullah community leaders announced the completion of a translation of the New Testament into modern Gullah, a project that took more than 20 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Montagne |first1=Renee |title='New Testament' Translated into Gullah |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5283230 |accessdate=11 November 2015 |agency=NPR |date=16 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Harvard University began offering Gullah/Geechee as a language class in its African Language Program. It is taught by Sunn m'Cheaux, a native-speaker from South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;url=https://alp.fas.harvard.edu/people/sunn-mcheaux&lt;/ref&gt;

This story, called {{lang|gul|Brer Lion an Brer Goat}}, was first published in 1888 by story collector Charles Colcock Jones Jr.:
:''{{lang|gul|Brer Lion bin a hunt, an eh spy Brer Goat duh leddown topper er big rock duh wuk eh mout an der chaw. Eh creep up fuh ketch um. Wen eh git close ter um eh notus um good. Brer Goat keep on chaw. Brer Lion try fuh fine out wuh Brer Goat duh eat. Eh yent see nuttne nigh um ceptin de nekked rock wuh eh duh leddown on. Brer Lion stonish. Eh wait topper Brer Goat. Brer Goat keep on chaw, an chaw, an chaw. Brer Lion cant mek de ting out, an eh come close, an eh say: "Hay! Brer Goat, wuh you duh eat?" Brer Goat skade wen Brer Lion rise up befo um, but eh keep er bole harte, an eh mek ansur: "Me duh chaw dis rock, an ef you dont leff, wen me done long um me guine eat you". Dis big wud sabe Brer Goat. Bole man git outer diffikelty way coward man lose eh life.}}''

In modern English this is rendered as follows:
:''Brer Lion was hunting, and he spied Brer Goat lying down on top of a big rock working his mouth and chewing. He crept up to catch him. When he got close to him, he watched him good. Brer Goat kept on chewing. Brer Lion tried to find out what Brer Goat was eating. He didn't see anything near him except the naked rock which he was lying down on. Brer Lion was astonished. He waited for Brer Goat. Brer Goat kept on chewing, and chewing, and chewing. Brer Lion couldn't make the thing out, and he came close, and he said: "Hey! Brer Goat, what are you eating?" Brer Goat was scared when Brer Lion rose up before him, but he kept a bold heart, and he made (his) answer: "I am chewing this rock, and if you don't leave me (alone), when I am done with it I will eat you". This big word saved Brer Goat. A bold man gets out of difficulty where a cowardly man loses his life.''
&lt;!-- This passage is from the New Testament in Gullah:
:''Now Jedus been bon een Betlem town, een Judea, jurin de same time wen Herod been king. Atta Jedus been bon, some wise man dem dat study bout de staa dem come ta Jerusalem fom weh dey been een de east. And dey aks say, "Weh de chile da, wa bon fa be de Jew people king? We beena see de staa wa tell bout um een de east, an we come fa woshup um op. Wen King Herod yeh dat, e been opsot fa true. And ebrybody een Jerusalem been opsot too. E call togeda all de leada dem ob de Jew priest dem and de Jew Law teacha dem. E aks um say, "Weh de Messiah gwine be bon at?" Dey tell King Herod say, "E gwine be bon een Betlem town een Judea".''&lt;ref&gt;The Gullah New Teastament, [http://www.gullahbible.com/Conc/41MATGUL.htm#2 Matthew 2:1-3]. Wycliffe Bible Translators, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translation===

Now Jesus was born in Bethlehem town, in Judea, during the same time when Herod was king. After Jesus was born, some wise men that studied about the stars came to Jerusalem from where they were in the east. And they asked, "Where is the child, who was born to be the Jewish king? We saw the star which told about him in the east, and we came to worship him". When King Herod heard that, he was truly upset. And everybody in Jerusalem was upset too. He called together all the leaders of the Jewish priests and the Jewish Law teachers. He asked them, "Where will the Messiah be born?" They told King Herod that, "He will be born in Bethlehem town in Judea".

==The Bible in Gullah==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
The persistence of the Gullah language has had an impact on African-American indigenous understanding of the Bible and has culminated in the translation of the Gospel according to Luke by the African-American Gullah people themselves. The American Bible Society (1994) published ''De Good Nyews Bout Jedus Christ Wa Luke Write: The Gospel according to Luke'' in the Gullah language in cooperation with and translated by the Gullah People themselves. The Preface states: ""The Gospel of Luke in Gullah (Sea Island Creole) is the first book of the Bible to be published in this tongue. This translation is prepared for the thousands of Sea Island speakers, whose language has been shown to be not only a completely worthy, but also a truly beautiful vehicle for the conveyance of God’s Good News. The Sea Island Translation and Literary Team is especially grateful to our numerous fellow Sea Islanders who have patiently and consistently contributed to the production of these sacred Scriptures into our mother tongue. The Team has prepared the translation in cooperation with the Summer Institute of Linguistics and Wycliffe Bible Translators and is deeply committed to the full authority and infallibility of the Bible as God’s written Word."

The following passage from the King James Bible (KJV) followed by the Gullah rendering is a good example of the contribution the Sea Island Translation and Literary Team has made to biblical translation of the Bible into indigenous languages:

King James Version (KJV):
'''16''' And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up for to read. '''17''' And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, '''18''' The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, '''19''' To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. (Luke 4:16-19, KJV).

African-American Gullah Version (AGV):

'''16''' Jedus gone to Nazrut, weh e libe from de time e been a leetle chile til e git big. Wen de Jew Woshup Day come, y gone ta de meetin house like e always do. An e stan op fa read God Book ta de people. '''17''' Dey gem de book wa Isaiah done write. Isaiah been a prophut wa taak fa God Book ta de people. So den, Jedus open de book ta da place weh Isaiah write, say, '''18''' "De Lawd Sperit da libe een me an gee me powa. Cause e done pick me fa tell de good nyews ta de po people. E done sen me fa tell dem wa ain’t free, say, ’Oona gwine be free.’ E sen me fa tell de bline people, say, ’Oona gwine see gin.’ E sen me fa free dem wa da suffa. '''19''' An e sen me fa tell de people say, ’De time done come wen de Lawd gwine sabe e people.’" (Luke 4:16-19,AGV). Too many non relevant examples --&gt;

==Kumbayah==
The phrase ''Kumbaya'' ("Come By Here"), taken from the [[Kumbaya|song of the same name]], is likely of Gullah origin.&lt;ref name="winick-folknews"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3566">An '''interpolation''', in relation to [[literature]] and especially ancient [[manuscript]]s, is an entry or passage in a text that was not written by the original author. As there are often several generations of copies between an extant copy of an ancient text and the original, each handwritten by different scribes, there is a natural tendency for extraneous material to be inserted into such documents over time.

Interpolations originally may be inserted as an authentic explanatory note (for example, {{bracket|[[sic]]}}), but may also be included for fraudulent purposes. The forged passages and works attributed to the [[Pseudo-Isidore]] are an example of the latter. Similarly, the letters of [[Ignatius of Antioch]] were interpolated by Apollinarian heretics, three centuries after the originals were written. Charters and legal texts are also subject to [[forgery]] of this kind.  In the 13th century a medieval romance, the ''[[Prose Tristan]]'', inserted another prose romance, the [[Vulgate]] ''Queste del Saint Graal'', in its entirety in order to reinterpret the Quest for the [[Holy Grail]] through the optics of the Tristan story.&lt;ref&gt;On the Medieval technique of manuscript ''[[interpolation]]'' and the ''Prose Tristan'', see Emmanuèle Baumgartner, "La préparation à la ''Queste del Saint Graal'' dans le ''Tristan'' en prose" in Norris Lacy, ed. ''Conjunctures'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 1994), pp. 1-14, Fanni Bogdanow, "L'Invention du texte, intertextualité et le problème de la transmission et de la classification de manuscrits" ''Romania'' 111 (190): 121-40 and Janina P. Traxler, "The Use and Abuse of the Grail Quest" ''Tristania'' 15 (1994): 23-31.  Gaston Paris, in 1897, also noted the interpolation of a verse romance on [[Brunor]] in ''Prose Tristan''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, most interpolations result from the errors and inaccuracies which tend to arise during hand-copying, especially over long periods of time. For example, if a [[scribe]] made an error when copying a text and omitted some lines, he would have tended to include the omitted material in the margin. However, margin notes made by readers are present in almost all manuscripts. Therefore, a different scribe seeking to produce a copy of the manuscript perhaps many years later could find it very difficult to determine whether a margin note was an omission made by the previous scribe (which should be included in the text) or simply a note made by a reader (which should be ignored or kept in the margin).

Conscientious scribes tended to copy everything which appeared in a manuscript, but in all cases scribes needed to exercise personal judgement. Explanatory notes would tend to find their way into the body of a text as a natural result of this subjective process.

Modern scholars have developed techniques{{Which|date=August 2010}} for recognizing interpolation, which are often apparent to modern observers, but would have been less so for medieval copyists.

The [[Comma Johanneum]], for example, is commonly regarded as interpolation. The specific problem of Christian transmission of Jewish texts outside the Jewish and Christian canons is often described as [[Christian interpolation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2894">'''John Lloyd-Jones''' (14 October 1885 &amp;ndash; 1 February 1956) was the first Professor of [[Welsh language|Welsh]] at the [[National University of Ireland, Dublin]], working in Dublin for over 40 years. In addition to his scholarly publications, Lloyd-Jones was also a prize-winning poet.

==Life==
Lloyd-Jones was born on 14 October 1885 and studied at the schools in [[Dolwyddelan]] and [[Llanrwst]], [[Wales]] before winning a [[scholarship]] to the [[University College of North Wales, Bangor]], in 1902. He obtained a degree in Welsh in 1906, studying under [[John Morris-Jones|Sir John Morris-Jones]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; He then became a research student at [[Jesus College, Oxford]] in 1907 for the postgraduate [[Degrees of the University of Oxford#Postgraduate degrees|BLitt]].&lt;ref name=WBO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wbo.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-LLOY-JOH-1885.html|title=Lloyd-Jones, John (1885&amp;ndash;1956), scholar and poet|work=Welsh Biography Online|publisher=[[National Library of Wales]]|accessdate=12 November 2008|last=Parry|first=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later studied Irish at the [[University of Freiburg]] with [[Rudolf Thurneysen]] and then was appointed as the first professor of Welsh at the [[National University of Ireland, Dublin]].&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;  In his obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', it was said of him that he became " a sort of unofficial ambassador from Wales to Ireland".&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; He was external examiner in Welsh for the University of Wales from 1916 until his retirement in 1955.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt;

He won a prize at the [[National Eisteddfod]] in [[Caernarfon]] in 1921 for a work on the places names of [[Caernarfonshire]], which was published in 1928 as ''{{lang|cy| Enwau lleoedd sir Gaernarfon}}''. This was the first modern scholarly study of its kind.&lt;ref name=WBO/&gt; In 1922, he won the Chair for his poem on the subject of winter. He was an expert on the Welsh language found in ancient sources, publishing a ''Vocabulary of Early Welsh Poetry'' in eight parts. In 1948, the [[British Academy]] asked him to deliver the lecture in memory of [[John Rhys|Sir John Rhys]], and his topic was "The Court Poets of the Welsh Princes". He was awarded an honorary doctorate of literature by the [[University of Wales]] in 1948. He retired from his professorship in September 1955 and died in Dolwyddelan at the age of 70.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|title= Prof. J.

The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) [[World Heritage site]]s are places of importance to [[Cultural heritage|cultural]] or [[natural heritage]] as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972.&lt;ref name="convention2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/convention/|title=The World Heritage Convention|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iran]] accepted the convention on 26 February 1975, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list. As of 2018, twenty-three sites in Iran are included.&lt;ref name="Iran2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/ir/|title=Iran|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate= 30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three sites in Iran, [[Naqsh-e Jahan Square|Meidan Emam, Isfahan]], [[Persepolis]] and [[Chogha Zanbil|Tchogha Zanbil]], were inscribed on the list at the 3rd Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in [[Paris]], [[France]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/repcom79.htm#113|title=Report of the 3rd Session of the Committee|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They remained the Islamic Republic's only listed properties until 2003, when [[Takht-e Soleymān|Takht-e Soleyman]] was added to the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/decrec03.htm#dec8-c-22|title=Report of the 27th Session of the Committee|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest addition was The Sassanid Archaeological Landscape, inscribed in 2018. 

In addition to its inscribed sites, Iran also lists fifty-five properties on its tentative list.&lt;ref name="IranTent2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/state=ir|title=Tentative List – Iran|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''Milli Vanilli''' was a German [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] duo from [[Munich]]. The group was founded by [[Frank Farian]] in 1988 and consisted of [[Fab Morvan]] and [[Rob Pilatus]]. The group's debut album, titled ''[[All or Nothing (Milli Vanilli album)|All or Nothing]]'' in Europe and reconfigured as ''[[Girl You Know It's True]]'' in the United States, achieved international success and earned them a [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] on 21 February 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/videos/32nd-annual-grammy-awards-best-new-artist |title=32nd Annual GRAMMY Awards – Best New Artist |publisher=GRAMMY.com |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Milli Vanilli became one of the most popular pop acts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with millions of records sold. However, their success quickly turned to infamy when Morvan, Pilatus, and their agent Sergio Vendero confessed that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing any of the vocals heard on their music releases. The duo ended up giving back the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.&lt;ref name="Shriver"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2010-01-26-millivanilli26_ST_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Milli Vanilli frontman says duo were musical 'scapegoats' | first=Jerry | last=Shriver | date=28 January 2010 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Milli Vanilli's Grammy Rescinded"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Milli Vanilli's Grammy Rescinded by Academy : Music: Organization revokes an award for the first time after revelation that the duo never sang on album.|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-20/news/mn-4948_1_milli-vanilli|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=20 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="It's True: Milli Vanilli Didn't Sing"&gt;{{cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=It's True: Milli Vanilli Didn't Sing : Pop music: The duo could be stripped of its Grammy after admitting it lip-synced the best-selling 'Girl You Know It's True.'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-16/entertainment/ca-4894_1_milli-vanilli|newspaper=LA Times|date=16 November 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group recorded a comeback album in 1998 titled ''Back and in Attack'', but the album was shelved after Rob Pilatus died at the age of 32.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33 |title=Milli Vanilli's Pilatus Dead At 32 |date=7 April 1998 |publisher=rollingstone.com |accessdate=25 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622144027/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/millivanilli/articles/story/5927796/milli_vanillis_pilatus_dead_at_33 |archivedate=22 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings, 1988==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016}}
According to [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'', the single "[[Girl You Know It's True (song)|Girl You Know It's True]]" was first produced by Jesse Powell and had already been completed before [[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fab Morvan]] were recruited. [[Frank Farian]] felt that no efforts should be made to refine Pilatus and Morvan's voices. 

Morvan claimed in 2011 that Farian had manipulated the two of them by giving them a small [[Advance payment|advance]] when he signed them. The pair spent most of it on clothes and hairstyling. Several months later, Farian called them and told them they had to [[lip sync]] to some prerecorded music or, as stated in the contract, repay the advance in full. "We were not hired, we were trapped," Morvan recalled.&lt;ref name="I Want My MTV"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY| isbn=9780525952305| pages=362–363|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lip-syncing exposure and media backlash, 1989-91==
[[Beth McCarthy-Miller]], then an executive with [[MTV]], says the duo's poor English language skills, when they came in for their first interview with the channel, stirred doubts among those present as to whether they had sung on their records.&lt;ref name="I Want My MTV" /&gt; The first public sign that the group was [[lip-syncing]] came on 21 July 1989, during a live performance on MTV at the [[Lake Compounce]] theme park in [[Bristol, Connecticut]]. As they performed, the recording of the song "Girl You Know It's True" jammed and began to skip, repeatedly playing the partial line "Girl, you know it's..." through the speakers. They continued to pretend to sing and dance onstage for a few more moments, then they both ran offstage. According to the episode of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]'' which profiled Milli Vanilli, [[Downtown Julie Brown]] stated that fans attending the concert seemed neither to care, nor even to notice, and the concert continued as if nothing unusual had happened.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} In a March 1990 issue of ''Time'' magazine, Pilatus was quoted proclaiming himself to be "the new [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]]", reasoning that by the duo's success they were more talented musically than [[Bob Dylan]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Mick Jagger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Cocks | first = Jay | title = Two Scoops Of Vanilli | newspaper = Time Magazine | date = 5 March 1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been refuted by Fab Morvan, as recently as 2017, stating that Rob never said those words and that the quote was taken out of context likely due to Rob still not having a full grasp of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua8UfLJ9Hik|title=Fab on CD Skipping During Milli Vanilli Performance, Lip Syncing Rumors|first=|last=djvlad|date=19 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=12 October 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the international release of ''All or Nothing'', the inserts for the American version of the album explicitly attributed the vocals to Morvan and Pilatus. This prompted singer [[Charles Shaw (singer)|Charles Shaw]] to reveal in December 1989 that he was one of the three actual singers on the album and that Pilatus and Morvan were impostors. Farian reportedly paid Shaw $150,000 to retract his statements, though this did not stem the tide of public criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318744,00.html|title=Artificial Vanilli|last=Goodman|first=Fred |author2=Trakin, Roy|date=30 November 1990|publisher=ew.com|accessdate=25 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of growing public questions as to who sang in the group, as well as Morvan and Pilatus' demand to Farian that they be allowed to sing on the next album, Farian confessed to reporters on 12 November 1990 that Morvan and Pilatus did not sing on the records. Having no intention of living a lie, Morvan and Pilatus stated their willingness to return their Grammy Award, which they ended up doing soon afterwards. However, their three [[American Music Award]]s were never returned and remain to this day in Frank Farian's possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeff Meyer |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-17/entertainment/ca-4262_1_milli-vanilli |title=Milli Vanilli Meltdown Angers Former Fans – latimes |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=17 November 1990 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After these details emerged, at least 27 different lawsuits&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|author=AP |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6DA1239F930A2575BC0A967958260 |title=Judge Rejects Milli Vanilli Refund Plan - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=13 August 1991 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were filed under various U.S. consumer fraud protection laws&lt;ref name=ohio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dworken-bernstein.com/articles/suit-seeks-refunds/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nSSah1j9?url=http://www.dworken-bernstein.com/articles/suit-seeks-refunds/ |archivedate=11 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; against Pilatus, Morvan and Arista Records. One such filing occurred on 22 November 1990, in Ohio, where lawyers filed a class-action lawsuit asking for refunds on behalf of a local woman in [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]], who had bought ''Girl You Know It's True''. At the time the lawsuit was filed, it was estimated at least 1,000 Ohio residents had bought the album.&lt;ref name="ohio"/&gt; On 12 August 1991, a proposed settlement of a refund lawsuit in Chicago, Illinois, was rejected. This settlement would have refunded buyers of Milli Vanilli CDs, cassettes, records, or singles. However, the refunds would only be given as a credit for a future Arista release.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; On 28 August, a new settlement was approved; it refunded those who attended concerts along with those who bought Milli Vanilli recordings.&lt;ref name="refund"&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE6D7173BF932A0575BC0A967958260 |title=Small Victory for Milli Vanilli Fans - NYTimes.com |publisher=New York Times |date=31 August 1991 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 10 million buyers were eligible to claim a refund and they could keep the refunded recordings as well.&lt;ref name="refund"/&gt; The deadline to claim refunds passed on 8 March 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Company|first1=Johnson Publishing|title=Judge Sets Deadline For Milli Vanilli Records|journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=30 September 1991|page=32|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DbwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Real Milli Vanilli, 1991-1992==
{{main|The Real Milli Vanilli}}
The resulting album, released in Europe in early 1991, was renamed ''[[The Moment of Truth (The Real Milli Vanilli album)|The Moment of Truth]]'' and spawned three singles, "Keep On Running", "Nice 'n Easy" and "Too Late (True Love)". A Morvan/Pilatus lookalike named Ray Horton was depicted on the cover along with the real singers: Brad Howell and John Davis. In addition, the album featured rappers Icy Bro on "Hard as Hell" and Tammy T on "Too Late (True Love)". Original members and vocalists Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco remained on 95% of the tracks. One of four [[Diane Warren]]-penned songs that are included on ''The Moment of Truth'', "When I Die", has been covered by several other artists, including Farian's [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]]. For the American market, Farian chose to avoid any association with Milli Vanilli and had the tracks re-recorded with Ray Horton on the majority of lead vocals. However, ''The Moment of Truth'' was never released in that format in the USA.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;

===Try 'N' B===
In 1992, [[RCA Records|RCA]] signed on to release the album as the debut of the newly created group [[The Real Milli Vanilli|Try 'N' B]]. The self-titled release included three additional tracks not on the Real Milli Vanilli release: "Ding Dong", "Who Do You Love", and a remake of [[Dr. Hook]]'s "[[Sexy Eyes (Dr. Hook song)|Sexy Eyes]]", and featured original Milli Vanilli vocalists Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco. Because of significantly better sales under the name Try 'N' B in America, a slightly modified Try 'N' B debut album was released internationally. It featured guest singer Tracy Ganser, a Ray Horton lookalike named Kevin Weatherspoon, as well as Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Rob &amp; Fab, 1990–1993==
{{Main|Rob &amp; Fab}}
Morvan and Pilatus moved to Los Angeles, California, and signed with the Joss Entertainment Group. [[Sandy Gallin]] was their manager.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/sandy-gallin-dead-1.4081453 Hollywood agent and producer Sandy Gallin dead at 76] The Associated Press, April 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded their follow-up album under the name [[Rob &amp; Fab (album)|''Rob &amp; Fab'']] which was financed by Taj Records in 1992 and released by Joss Entertainment in 1993. Almost all the songs on the album were written by Kenny Taylor and Fab Morvan, while Morvan and Pilatus provided the lead vocals. Werner Schüler, a German bassist and songwriter, was their producer.&lt;ref name =imdb&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6693994/ Milli Vanilli: From Fame to Shame] IMDb, 60min documentary, 23 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Because of financial constraints, Joss Entertainment Group was only able to release the album in the United States, the priority market to Milli Vanilli. A single, "We Can Get It On", was made available for radio play shortly before the album's release. However, the lack of publicity, poor distribution, and their steep fall from the height of pop-culture visibility after the lip-synching scandal contributed to its failure.

==Comeback and death of Rob Pilatus, 1997-1998==
In order to restore their career, Farian agreed to produce a new Milli Vanilli album with Morvan and Pilatus on lead vocals in 1997. This led up to the recording of the 1998 Milli Vanilli comeback album ''Back and In Attack''. Even some of the original studio singers backed the performers in their attempt to bring back some of the fame that had been shed so quickly. However, Rob Pilatus encountered a number of personal problems during the production of the new album. He turned to drugs and crime, committing a series of assaults and robberies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Company|first1=Johnson Publishing|title=Ex-Member Of Milli Vanilli Arrested For Terrorist Threat|journal=[[Jet (magazine)|Jet]]|date=19 February 1996|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=rob+pilatus+jail&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8fpDbsVLpU&amp;sig=R_nZSm4BtDYN0YDZQRDormhTu4U&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CHsQ6AEwD2oVChMIzcSg9Pi-xwIVB0oUCh3MiwFi#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20pilatus%20jail&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 September 2016|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was ultimately sentenced to three months in jail and six months in a drug rehabilitation facility in California.

As a result ''Back and In Attack'' remains unreleased and the tour was cancelled. The recordings are assumed to have been destroyed.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==Fab Morvan's solo career==
Morvan spent the following years as a [[session musician]] and [[public speaker]] while working on his musical abilities. In 1998, he was a [[Disc jockey#Radio DJs|DJ]] at famed L.A. [[radio station]] [[KIIS-FM]]. During this period he also performed at the station's sold-out 1999 [[Wango Tango]] festival concert before 50,000 people at [[Dodger Stadium]]. Morvan then spent 2001 on tour before performing in 2002 as the inaugural performer at the brand-new Velvet Lounge at the [[Hard Rock Hotel]] in Orlando, Florida. In 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, ''[[Love Revolution (Fabrice Morvan album)|Love Revolution]]''. He marketed the album through his website and [[CD Baby]].

In April 2011, Morvan released the single "Anytime" on iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/anytime/id430872374?i=430872419 |title= Anytime on iTunes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later developments==
In 1991, Pilatus and Morvan appeared in a commercial for Carefree Sugarless Gum, which parodied their lip-syncing fiasco. They also appeared in an episode of the Super Mario Bros. cartoon and even signed with a PR firm in hopes of breaking into acting. As they told the ''[[L.A. Times]]'', "We think we have the potential to become actors. After all, we got a lot of practice while we were in Milli Vanilli. But the most important thing to us now is the new album." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/12196/the-rise-and-fall-of-milli-vanilli|title=Girl You Know It's True: the rise and fall of Milli Vanilli 25 years later|work=CBC Music|access-date=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The duo was featured (and interviewed) for the premiere episode of [[VH1]]{{'s}} ''[[Behind the Music]]'' in 1997.

In 2000, Fab Morvan was featured in a [[BBC]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] titled ''It Takes Two: The Story of the Pop Duo'' about musical duos.

On 14 February 2007, it was announced that [[Universal Pictures]] was developing a film based on the story of Milli Vanilli's rise and fall in the music industry. [[Jeff Nathanson]], screenwriter for ''[[Catch Me If You Can]]'', producers [[Kathleen Kennedy (film producer)|Kathleen Kennedy]] and [[Frank Marshall (film producer)|Frank Marshall]], and producer executive Adam Yoelin, were supposed to write and direct the film while Fab Morvan served as a consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicole Frehsee |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/02/20/girl-you-know-its-true-milli-vanill-biopic-will-reveal-the-truth/ |title=Girl, You Know It’s True: Milli Vanilli Biopic Will Reveal the Truth (!) : Rolling Stone : Rock and Roll Daily |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=22 September 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619083951/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/02/20/girl-you-know-its-true-milli-vanill-biopic-will-reveal-the-truth/ |archivedate=19 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Catsoulis |first=Jeannette |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/449676/Untitled-Universal-Pictures-Milli-Vanilli-Project-/details |title=Movie Reviews – The New York Times |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=22 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in February 2011, it was announced the Milli Vanilli movie would be rewritten and directed by [[Florian Gallenberger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/news/2011/02/the-milli-vanilli-film.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909111437/http://www.ifc.com/news/2011/02/the-milli-vanilli-film.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=No Filter |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifitsmovies.com/2011/02/the-milli-vanilli-film-finds-oscar-winning-director/ |title=IFITSMOVIES – Serving you the best. |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110215004759/http://www.ifitsmovies.com/2011/02/the-milli-vanilli-film-finds-oscar-winning-director/ |archivedate=15 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The documentary "Milli Vanilli: From Fame to Shame" was eventually directed by German Oliver Schwehm, and produced by Hannah Lenitzki from Bremedia Produktion, released in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6693994/ Milli Vanilli: From Fame to Shame] IMDb, 1h documentary, 23 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the actual Milli Vanilli singers — Jodie Rocco and Linda Rocco, John Davis and Brad Howell — filmed an in-depth interview with the producers of ''Oprah: Where Are They Now'' for [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN TV]]. The show aired in the US on Friday, 21 February 2014.{{Cn|date=July 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Some of the "Real" Voices Behind Milli Vanilli Kept Quiet|url=http://www.oprah.com/own-where-are-they-now/why-some-of-the-real-voices-behind-milli-vanilli-kept-quiet-video|website=OWNTV Season 3 Episode 308 Aired on February 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 [[TMZ]] reported that Fab Morvan was working on an album with John Davis, one of the original Milli Vanilli singers, called ''Face Meets Voice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milli Vanilli man attempts comeback – with the man who actually sang the songs|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/01/milli-vanilli-fab-morvan-comeback-man-who-actually-sang|website=The Guardian|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nevalı Çori''' ({{lang-tr|Nevali Çori}}) was an [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|early Neolithic]] settlement on the middle [[Euphrates]], in [[Şanlıurfa Province]], [[Southeastern Anatolia Region|Southeastern Anatolia]], [[Turkey]]. The site is known for having some of the world's oldest known [[temples]] and monumental [[sculpture]]. Together with the earlier site of [[Göbekli Tepe]], it has revolutionised scientific understanding of the Eurasian [[Neolithic]] period. The oldest domesticated [[Triticum monococcum|Einkorn wheat]] was found there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Haldorsen, S. et al.|journal=Veget. Hist. Archaeobot (2011) 20: 305.|title=The climate of the Younger Dryas as a boundary for Einkorn domestication|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00334-011-0291-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement was located about 490 m above sea level, in the foothills of the [[Taurus Mountains]], on both banks of the Kantara stream, a tributary of the Euphrates.

==Excavation==
The site was examined from 1983 to 1991 in the context of rescue [[excavations]] during the erection of the [[Atatürk Dam]] below [[Samsat]]. [[Excavations]] were conducted by a team from the [[University of Heidelberg]] under the direction of Professor Harald Hauptmann. Together with numerous other archaeological sites in the vicinity, Nevalı Çori has since been inundated by the damming of the Euphrates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tayproject.org/TAYmaster.fm$Retrieve?YerlesmeNo=2064&amp;html=masterengdetail.html&amp;layout=web The Archaeological Settlements of Turkey - TAY Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological chronology==
Nevalı Çori could be placed within the local relative chronology on the basis of its [[flint]] tools. The occurrence of narrow unretouched [[Byblos]]-type points places it on Oliver Aurenche's Phase 3, i.e. early to middle [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] ([[PPNB]]). Some tools indicate continuity into Phase 4, which is similar in date to Late [[PPNB]]. An even finer chronological distinction within Phase 3 is permitted by the settlement's architecture; the house type with underfloor channels, typical of Nevalı Çori strata I-IV, also characterises the "Intermediate Layer" at [[Çayönü]], while the differing plan of the single building in stratum V, House 1, is more clearly connected to the buildings of the "Cellular Plan Layer" at Çayönü.

===Common date===
In terms of absolute dates, four [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] have been determined for Nevalı Çori. Three are from Stratum II and date it with some certainty to the second half of the 9th millennium BC, which coincides with early dates from Çayönü and with [[Mureybet]] IVA and thus supports the relative chronology above. The fourth dates to the 10th millennium BC, which, if correct, would indicate the presence of an extremely early phase of PPNB at Nevalı Çori.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/iss/kap_a/advanced/ta_1_2g.html Early Places Without Metals]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Houses==
[[File:Schachthuis.jpg|thumb|Archaeological illustration from ''Nevalı Çori, eastern Turkey'']]
The settlement had five architectural levels. The excavated architectural remains were of long rectangular houses containing two to three parallel flights of rooms, interpreted as [[mezzanine]]s. These are adjacent to a similarly rectangular ante-structure, subdivided by wall projections, which should be seen as a residential space. This type of house is characterized by thick, multi-layered foundations made of large angular cobbles and boulders, the gaps filled with smaller stones so as to provide a relatively even surface to support the superstructure. These foundations are interrupted every 1-1.5m by underfloor channels, at right angles to the main axis of the houses, which were covered in stone slabs but open to the sides. They may have served the drainage, aeration or the cooling of the houses. 23 such structures were excavated, they are strikingly similar to structures from the so-called channeled subphase at Çayönü.

An area in the northwest part of the village appears to be of special importance. Here, a cult complex had been cut into the hillside. It had three subsequent architectural phases, the most recent belonging to Stratum III, the middle one to Stratum II and the oldest to Stratum I. The two more recent phases also possessed a [[terrazzo]]-style lime cement floor, which did not survive from the oldest phase. Parallels are known from [[Cayönü]] and [[Göbekli Tepe]]. [[Monolith]]ic pillars similar to those at Göbekli Tepe were built into its [[dry stone wall]]s, its interior contained two free-standing pillars of 3&amp;nbsp;m height. The excavator assumes light flat roofs. Similar structures are only known from Göbekli Tepe so far.

Soundings cut to examine the western side of the valley also revealed rectilinear architecture in 2-3 layers.

==Sculpture and clay figurines==
[[Image:UrfaMuseumNevaliCori.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|Fragment of Neolithic art from Nevalı Çori depicting a hunting scene]]

The local limestone was [[Sculpture|carved]] into numerous [[statue]]s and smaller sculptures, including a more than life-sized bare human head with a snake or [[sikha]]-like tuft. There is also a statue of a bird. Some of the pillars also bore [[relief]]s, including ones of human hands. The free-standing anthropomorphic figures of limestone excavated at Nevalı Çori belong to the earliest known life-size sculptures. Comparable material has been found at Göbekli Tepe.

Several hundred small [[clay]] [[figurine]]s (about 5&amp;nbsp;cm high), most of them depicting humans, have been interpreted as [[votive offerings]]. They were fired at temperatures between 500-600&amp;nbsp;°C, which suggests the development of ceramic firing technology before the advent of [[pottery]] proper.

==Bas relief==

A [[bas relief]] on a fragment of a limestone bowl depicts two humans and one [[tortoise]]-like creature [[dancing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliver Dietrich et al.|title=The role of cult and feasting in the emergence of Neolithic communities.

{{italic title}}
'''''Occupational Hazards: My Time Governing in Iraq''''' or '''''The Prince of the Marshes: And other Occupational Hazards of a Year in Iraq''''' is a 2006 non-fiction book by the British writer and Member of Parliament [[Rory Stewart]].

== Content==
'''''Occupational Hazards''''' documents Stewart's experiences as [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] Deputy Governor of the Iraqi province of [[Maysan]] and Senior Advisor in the province of [[Dhi Qar]]. These provinces in the remote, impoverished marsh regions of [[southern Iraq]] were home to a diverse number of parties and peoples and Stewart spends much of his time mediating, negotiating hostage releases, holding elections, and trying to restore order to a society which seemed on the edge of civil war, following the [[Iraq War]]. Much of the book is concerned with Stewart's dealings with the Prince of the Marshes, a local warlord who had fought against [[Saddam Hussein]] and regarded Stewart's actions with suspicion. '''''Occupational Hazards''''' explores the hostility experienced by Coalition troops and administrators, mostly notably when, in May 2004, Stewart and his compound in [[Nasiriyah]] were besieged by [[Sadrist]] militia, an experience he recounted in his [[Desert Island Discs]] appearance of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008pdqp|title=BBC Radio 4 - Desert Island Discs, Rory Stewart|website=BBC|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1994 he has been Professor of Central Asian Studies (Zentralasienwissenschaften, Tibetology and Mongol Studies) at [[Leipzig University]], Germany.

==Biography==
Born in København, Denmark. From 1971 to 1982 he studied Tibetology, Sinology, and Indology at [[Copenhagen University]]. In 1981 Sørensen received his mag. art. (magister) degree from the University &lt;ref name="uni-leipzig"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gko.uni-leipzig.de/indologie/institut/mitarbeiter/prof-dr-per-kjeld-soerensen.html|title=Prof. Dr. Per K. Sørensen|publisher=Institut für Indologie und Zentralasienwissenschaften, Universität Leipzig |website= |language = German |accessdate=2015-11-30 }}[&lt;/ref&gt; and  as the first person to receive a Magister in Tibetology in Scandinavia.&lt;ref name="Politiken"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kerte |first=Jens |date=1982-06-29 |title=Tibet er hans livsogave:31-drig magister i tibetansk |trans-title= |language=Danish |url= |newspaper=[[Politiken]] |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His teacher was [[Erik Haarh]], who  had studied in the 1950s with the pioneer of [[Tibetology]], [[Giuseppe Tucci]] in Rome. As his principal student, Haarh had a lasting influence on Sørensen particularly inspiring his interest in Tibetan history. In 1990, Sørensen defended his doctoral thesis (Københavns Universitet) ''Divinity Secularized. An Inquiry into the Nature and Form of the Songs Ascribed to the Sixth Dalai Lama'' (Wien 1990).&lt;ref name="uni-leipzig" /&gt; 
	
Sørensen has teaching commitments and experience from Denmark, Sweden, Finland and the United States. He was the recipient of an Alexander von Humboldt Stipend (1991–92) in Bonn, Germany, a sojourn that resulted in one of his most well known works, ''Tibetan Buddhist Historiography'' (1994).&lt;ref Name="HistoriographyPref"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sørensen |first=Per K. |authorlink=Per K.

From 1994 to 2017 he held the chair of Professor of Central Asian Studies (Zentralasienwissenschaften, Tibetology and Mongol Studies) at Leipzig Universität, Germany,&lt;ref name="uni-leipzig" /&gt; which is the second-oldest university in Germany and has a long tradition of Oriental studies.

Sørensen has travelled widely in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal and the Himalayas. He has been involved in a number of prestigious projects in his field and also editorial commitments. From 1995 until 2010, he headed a long-term Danish-funded twinning project at the [[National Library of Bhutan]], conducted in collaboration with the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library of Denmark]].&lt;ref name=NLB&gt;{{Cite web|title=Danida Library Twinning Project|url=http://www.library.gov.bt/library/danidaProject.html|website=The National Library of Bhutan|accessdate=2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has held lectures around the world and is currently a board member of [[The International Association for Tibetan Studies]] (IATS).

In 2015 he was a participant in the Tibet Research Group on “Tibetan Genealogies" at Wissenschaftskolleg Berlin (Institute for Advanced Study), with Guntram Harzod (head), Tsering Gyalpo (Lhasa) and Shen Weirong (Beijing). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tibetan Genealogies|url= http://www.wiko-berlin.de/en/fellows/fellowships/focus-groups/focus/tibetische-genealogien/|website=|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sounding Tibet in Grunewald|author=Michael Oppitz |url= http://www.wiko-berlin.de/en/wikotheque/koepfe-und-ideen/issue//die-vermessung-tibets-im-grunewald/|website=Wissenschaftkolleg zu Berlin|accessdate=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:OC-Performing-Arts-Center.jpg|thumb|right| Segerstrom Concert Hall of the Segerstrom Center for the Arts]]
'''Performing arts center/centre''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences]]), often abbreviated as PAC, is used to refer to: 

* A multi-use performance space that is intended for use by various types of the [[performing arts]], including [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]]. 

:The intended multiple use of performing arts centers in this sense differentiates them from single-purpose [[List of concert halls|concert halls]], [[opera house]]s or [[theater (structure)|theatres]], although the actual use of single-purpose spaces for other than their intended use is widespread. This sort of space has a long history extending to the Roman [[Colosseum]] and Greek amphitheatres.

* A cluster of performance spaces, either separate buildings or under one roof, each space designed for a specific purpose such as [[orchestra|symphonic music]] or [[chamber music]] or theatre, but multi-purpose as a whole. The modern version of this came into being only in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=PAC&gt;{{cite web|last=Wolff|first=Steven A.|title=The evolution of the performing arts center|url=http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|publisher=AMS Planning &amp; Research Corp|accessdate=20 January 2014|date=October 20, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114201139/http://www.ams-online.com/trends/evolution.php|archivedate=14 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:Examples of this type of PAC are the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in Washington, D.C., the [[Sydney Opera House]], and the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]] in New York City.

Some performing arts center organizations act as sole presenter for events using the venues within the center, but most also frequently rent their performance spaces to other [[performing arts presenters]] or self-presenting performing arts groups. Examples of this practice is the [[Celebrity Series of Boston]] renting venues in Boston's [[Boch Center]].

New performing arts centers emerged in the latter part of the 20th century as a means of generating new investment and increased economic activity and thus, a means for revitalizing neighborhoods as patrons are drawn to local restaurants and other businesses. PACs became a draw for touring shows and eventually included visual art in their facilities. Today, these centers are valuable civic resources that provide education, access, exchange of creative discourse, opportunities for cultural expression and awareness.&lt;ref name=PAC/&gt;

The '''''Perugia Altarpiece''''' (Italian: ''Pala di Perugia'') is a painting   by the Italian early Renaissance painter   [[Fra Angelico]], housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria]] of [[Perugia]], Italy. 

==History==
The painting was executed for the St. Nicholas Chapel in the [[Basilica of San Domenico, Perugia]]. In the early 19th century, it was split and partially dispersed, and some of the predella panels were acquired by the [[Pinacoteca Vaticana]]. In Perugia were executed copies of these panels, enclosed into a neo-Gothic frame. The [[polyptych]] also included some small depictions of saints, on the side piers, and two [[Tondo (art)|tondoes]] with the ''Annunciation Angel'' and the ''Annunciation'', in the cusps.

==Description==

The work includes a large central panel, depicting the ''Madonna Enthroned with Child and Angels'', which was fully painted by Fra Angelico. The two side panels, each forming  two arched sub-panels and including a figure of saint.  On the left are [[St. Dominic]] and [[St. Nicholas of Bari|St. Nicholas]], attributed to Angelico, while on the right are [[St. John the Baptist]] and [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]], considered mostly by his workshop. 

The central Madonna is a ''[[Maestà]]'' depiction, and sits on  a large throne painted using [[geometric perspective]]. In front of her is a step with vases housing three white and red roses (symbolizing of the Virgin's purity and a forecast of Christ's Passion, respectively). The panel resembles strictly  that in the [[Cortona Triptych]], especially for the Madonna, the throne's arch and the placement of the angels. The pavement is decorated with marble tarsia, already used by Fra Angelico in earlier works such as the [[San Pietro Martire Triptych]] (1428-1429).

The saint's figures are less monumental than in the later [[Tabernacle of the Lanaioli]] (1433-1435). Behind them is a table, covered by a brocade drape decorated in gold, over which is St. Nicholas' [[mitre]].

The predella panels portray scenes of the ''Life of St. Nicholas''

[[Artificial intelligence]] has close connections with [[philosophy]] because both share several concepts and these include intelligence, action, [[consciousness]], [[epistemology]], and even [[free will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jmc.stanford.edu/articles/aiphil2.html|title=The Philosophy of AI and the AI of Philosophy|last=McCarthy|first=John|website=jmc.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the technology is concerned with the creation of artificial animals or artificial people (or, at least, artificial creatures) so the discipline is of considerable interest to philosophers.&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{Citation|last=Bringsjord|first=Selmer|title=Artificial Intelligence|date=2018|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/artificial-intelligence/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-09-18|last2=Govindarajulu|first2=Naveen Sundar}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors contributed to the emergence of the '''philosophy of artificial intelligence.''' Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental.

The philosophy of artificial intelligence attempts to answer such questions as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}} define the philosophy of AI as consisting of the first two questions, and the additional question of the [[ethics of artificial intelligence]]. {{Harvnb|Fearn|2007|p=55}} writes "In the current literature, philosophy has two chief roles: to determine whether or not such machines would be conscious, and, second, to predict whether or not such machines are possible." The last question bears on the first two.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Can a machine act intelligently? Can it solve ''any'' problem that a person would solve by thinking?
* Are human intelligence and machine intelligence the same?  Is the [[human brain]] essentially a computer?
* Can a machine have a [[philosophy of mind|mind]], mental states, and [[consciousness]] in the same way that a human being can? Can it ''feel how things are''?
These three questions reflect the divergent interests of [[artificial intelligence|AI researchers]], [[Linguistics|linguists]], [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] and [[philosophy|philosopher]]s respectively. The scientific answers to these questions depend on the definition of "intelligence" and "consciousness" and exactly which "machines" are under discussion.

Important [[proposition]]s in the philosophy of AI include:

*[[Turing test|Turing's "polite convention"]]: ''If a machine behaves as intelligently as a human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.''&lt;ref name=T&gt;This is a paraphrase of the essential point of the [[Turing test]]. {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|pp=6–9}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=24}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=2–3 and 948}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dartmouth Workshop#Planning the Summer Research Project: The Proposal |Dartmouth proposal]]: ''"Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it."''&lt;ref name=MMRS&gt;{{Harvnb|McCarthy|Minsky|Rochester|Shannon|1955}}. This assertion was printed in the program for the [[Dartmouth Conferences|Dartmouth Conference]] of 1956, widely considered the "birth of AI."also {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Allen Newell|Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon|Simon]]'s [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis: ''"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action."''&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{Harvnb|Newell|Simon|1976}} and {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[John Searle|Searle]]'s [[strong AI hypothesis]]: ''"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."''&lt;ref name=SWAI&gt;This version is from {{Harvtxt|Searle|1999}}, and is also quoted in {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=435}}. Searle's original formulation was "The appropriately programmed computer really is a mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and have other cognitive states."  {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=1}}.  Strong AI is defined similarly by {{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}: "The assertion that machines could possibly act intelligently (or, perhaps better, act as if they were intelligent) is called the 'weak AI' hypothesis by philosophers, and the assertion that machines that do so are actually thinking (as opposed to simulating thinking) is called the 'strong AI' hypothesis."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]]' mechanism: ''"For 'reason' ... is nothing but 'reckoning,' that is adding and subtracting, of the consequences of general names agreed upon for the 'marking' and 'signifying' of our thoughts..."''&lt;ref name=H&gt;{{Harvnb|Hobbes|1651|loc=chpt. 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Can a machine display general intelligence?==
Is it possible to create a machine that can solve ''all'' the problems humans solve using their intelligence? This question defines the scope of what machines will be able to do in the future and guides the direction of AI research. It only concerns the ''behavior'' of machines and ignores the issues of interest to [[psychology|psychologists]], cognitive scientists and [[philosophy|philosophers]]; to answer this question, it does not matter whether a machine is ''really'' thinking (as a person thinks) or is just ''acting like'' it is thinking.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}}, where they make the distinction between ''acting'' rationally and ''being'' rational, and define AI as the study of the former.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic position of most AI researchers is summed up in this statement, which appeared in the proposal for the [[Dartmouth workshop]] of 1956:
* ''Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it.''&lt;ref name=MMRS/&gt;
Arguments against the basic premise must show that building a working AI system is impossible, because there is some practical limit to the abilities of computers or that there is some special quality of the human mind that is necessary for thinking and yet cannot be duplicated by a machine (or by the methods of current AI research).  Arguments in favor of the basic premise must show that such a system is possible.

The first step to answering the question is to clearly define "intelligence".

===Intelligence===
[[File:Turing Test version 3.png|thumb|The "standard interpretation" of the Turing test.{{sfn|Saygin|2000}}]]

====Turing test====
{{Main|Turing test}}

[[Alan Turing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} and see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=948}}, where they call his paper "famous" and write "Turing examined a wide variety of possible objections to the possibility of intelligent machines, including virtually all of those that have been raised in the half century since his paper appeared."&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the problem of defining intelligence to a simple question about conversation. He suggests that: if a machine can answer ''any'' question put to it, using the same words that an ordinary person would, then we may call that machine intelligent. A modern version of his experimental design would use an online [[chat room]], where one of the participants is a real person and one of the participants is a computer program. The program passes the test if no one can tell which of the two participants is human.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; Turing notes that no one (except philosophers) ever asks the question "can people think?" He writes "instead of arguing continually over this point, it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Consciousness"&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's test extends this polite convention to machines:
* ''If a machine acts as intelligently as human being, then it is as intelligent as a human being.''
One criticism of the [[Turing test]] is that it is explicitly [[anthropomorphic]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. If our ultimate goal is to create machines that are ''more'' intelligent than people, why should we insist that our machines must closely ''resemble'' people?{{Cite quote|date=April 2017}} [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] write that "aeronautical engineering texts do not define the goal of their field as 'making machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Intelligent agent definition====
[[File:IntelligentAgent-SimpleReflex.png|thumb|left|Simple reflex agent]]
Recent A.I. research defines intelligence in terms of [[intelligent agent]]s. An "agent" is something which perceives and acts in an environment. A "performance measure" defines what counts as success for the agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=4–5, 32, 35, 36 and 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''If an agent acts so as to maximize the expected value of a performance measure based on past experience and knowledge then it is intelligent.''&lt;ref&gt;Russell and Norvig would prefer the word "[[rational agent|rational]]" to "intelligent".&lt;/ref&gt;
Definitions like this one try to capture the essence of intelligence. They have the advantage that, unlike the Turing test, they do not also test for human traits that we {{Who|date=April 2017}} may not want to consider intelligent, like the ability to be insulted or the temptation to lie {{Dubious|date=April 2017}}. They have the disadvantage that they fail to make the commonsense{{Definition|date=April 2017}} differentiation between "things that think" and "things that do not". By this definition, even a thermostat has a rudimentary intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=48–52}} consider a thermostat a simple form of [[intelligent agent]], known as a [[Intelligent agent#Classes of intelligent agents|reflex agent]]. For an in-depth treatment of the role of the thermostat in philosophy see {{harvtxt|Chalmers|1996|pp=293–301}} "4. Is Experience Ubiquitous?" subsections ''What is it like to be a thermostat?'', ''Whither panpsychism?'', and ''Constraining the double-aspect principle''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments that a machine can display general intelligence===

====The brain can be simulated====
{{Main|Artificial brain}}

[[File:MRI.ogg|thumbtime=2|thumb|240px|An [[MRI]] scan of a normal adult human brain]]
[[Hubert Dreyfus]] describes this argument as claiming that "if the nervous system obeys the laws of physics and chemistry, which we have every reason to suppose it does, then .... we ... ought to be able to reproduce the behavior of the nervous system with some physical device".&lt;ref name="Dreyfus 1972 p=106"&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972|p=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; This argument, first introduced as early as 1943&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pitts|McCullough|1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; and vividly described by [[Hans Moravec]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now associated with futurist [[Ray Kurzweil]], who estimates that computer power will be sufficient for a complete brain simulation by the year 2029.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kurzweil|2005|p=262}}. Also see {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|p=957}} and {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=271 and 279}}. The most extreme form of this argument (the brain replacement scenario) was put forward by [[Clark Glymour]] in the mid-1970s and was touched on by [[Zenon Pylyshyn]] and John Searle in 1980&lt;/ref&gt; A non-real-time simulation of a thalamocortical model that has the size of the human brain (10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; neurons) was performed in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm |title=Eugene M. Izhikevich, Large-Scale Simulation of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501041325/http://vesicle.nsi.edu/users/izhikevich/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm |archivedate=2009-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it took 50 days to simulate 1 second of brain dynamics on a cluster of 27 processors.

Few{{Quantify|date=April 2017}} disagree that a brain simulation is possible in theory,{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{According to whom|date=April 2017}} even critics of AI such as Hubert Dreyfus and John Searle.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus writes: "In general, by accepting the fundamental assumptions that the nervous system is part of the physical world and that all physical processes can be described in a mathematical formalism which can, in turn, be manipulated by a digital computer, one can arrive at the strong claim that the behavior which results from human 'information processing,' whether directly formalizable or not, can always be indirectly reproduced on a digital machine." {{Harv|Dreyfus|1972|pp=194–5}}. [[John Searle]] writes: "Could a man made machine think? Assuming it possible produce artificially a machine with a nervous system, ... the answer to the question seems to be obviously, yes ... Could a digital computer think? If by 'digital computer' you mean anything at all that has a level of description where it can be correctly described as the instantiation of a computer program, then again the answer is, of course, yes, since we are the instantiations of any number of computer programs, and we can think." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Searle points out that, in principle, ''anything'' can be simulated by a computer; thus, bringing the definition to its breaking point leads to the conclusion that any process at all can technically be considered "computation". "What we wanted to know is what distinguishes the mind from thermostats and livers," he writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, merely mimicking the functioning of a brain would in itself be an admission of ignorance regarding intelligence and the nature of the mind {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.
&lt;!--ARENT THERE SOME MORE DIRECT REFUTATIONS OF KURZWEIL?? --&gt;

====Human thinking is symbol processing====
{{Main|Physical symbol system}}

In 1963, [[Allen Newell]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] proposed that "symbol manipulation" was the essence of both human and machine intelligence. They wrote: 
* ''A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.''&lt;ref name=NS/&gt;
This claim is very strong: it implies both that human thinking is a kind of symbol manipulation (because a symbol system is ''necessary'' for intelligence) and that machines can be intelligent (because a symbol system is ''sufficient'' for intelligence).&lt;ref&gt;Searle writes "I like the straight forwardness of the claim." {{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version of this position was described by philosopher Hubert Dreyfus, who called it "the psychological assumption":
* ''The mind can be viewed as a device operating on bits of information according to formal rules.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A distinction is usually made {{By whom|date=April 2017}} between the kind of high level symbols that directly correspond with objects in the world, such as &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;dog&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;tail&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the more complex "symbols" that are present in a machine like a [[neural network]]. Early research into AI, called "good old fashioned artificial intelligence" ([[GOFAI]]) by [[John Haugeland]], focused on these kind&lt;!--change to "kinds" or "types"?--&gt; of high level symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arguments against symbol processing====
These arguments show that human thinking does not consist (solely) of high level symbol manipulation. They do ''not'' show that artificial intelligence is impossible, only that more than symbol processing is required.

=====Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments=====
{{Main article|Mechanism (philosophy)#G.C3.B6delian arguments|l1=Mechanism (philosophy): Gödelian arguments}}
In 1931, [[Kurt Gödel]] proved with an [[incompleteness theorem]] that it is always possible to construct a "Gödel [[statement (logic)|statement]]" that a given consistent [[formal system]] of logic (such as a high-level symbol manipulation program) could not prove. Despite being a true statement, the constructed Gödel statement is unprovable in the given system. (The truth of the constructed Gödel statement is contingent on the consistency of the given system; applying the same process to a subtly inconsistent system will appear to succeed, but will actually yield a false "Gödel statement" instead.){{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} More speculatively, Gödel conjectured that the human mind can correctly eventually determine the truth or falsity of any well-grounded mathematical statement (including any possible Gödel statement), and that therefore the human mind's power is not reducible to a ''[[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel, Kurt]], 1951, ''Some basic theorems on the foundations of mathematics and their implications'' in  [[Solomon Feferman]], ed., 1995. ''Collected works / Kurt Gödel, Vol. III''. Oxford University Press: 304-23. - In this lecture, Gödel uses the incompleteness theorem to arrive at the following disjunction: (a) the human mind is not a consistent finite machine, or (b) there exist [[Diophantine equations]] for which it cannot decide whether solutions exist. Gödel finds (b) implausible, and thus seems to have believed the human mind was not equivalent to a finite machine, i.e., its power exceeded that of any finite machine. He recognized that this was only a conjecture, since one could never disprove (b). Yet he considered the disjunctive conclusion to be a "certain fact".&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[John Lucas (philosopher)|John Lucas]] (since 1961) and [[Roger Penrose]] (since 1989) have championed this philosophical anti-mechanist argument.&lt;ref name=L&gt;{{Harvnb|Lucas|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=949–950}}, {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=471–473,476–477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments tend to rely on the innocuous-seeming claim that a system of human mathematicians (or some idealization of human mathematicians) is both consistent (completely free of error) and believes fully in its own consistency (and can make all logical inferences that follow from its own consistency, including belief in its Gödel statement) {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. This is provably impossible for a Turing machine {{Clarify|date=April 2017}} (and, by an informal extension, any known type of mechanical computer) to do; therefore, the Gödelian concludes that human reasoning is too powerful to be captured in a machine {{Dubious|date=April 2017}}.

However, the modern consensus in the scientific and mathematical community is that actual human reasoning is inconsistent; that any consistent "idealized version" ''H'' of human reasoning would logically be forced to adopt a healthy but counter-intuitive open-minded skepticism about the consistency of ''H'' (otherwise ''H'' is provably inconsistent); and that Gödel's theorems do not lead to any valid argument that humans have mathematical reasoning capabilities beyond what a machine could ever duplicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Graham Oppy]]|title=Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/goedel-incompleteness/#GdeArgAgaMec|website=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=20 January 2015|quote=These Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are, however, problematic, and there is wide consensus that they fail.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Stuart J. Russell]]|author2=[[Peter Norvig]]|title=[[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach]]|date=2010|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=0-13-604259-7|edition=3rd|chapter=26.1.2: Philosophical Foundations/Weak AI: Can Machines Act Intelligently?/The mathematical objection|quote=...even if we grant that computers have limitations on what they can prove, there is no evidence that humans are immune from those limitations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Colyvan. An introduction to the philosophy of mathematics. [[Cambridge University Press]], 2012. From 2.2.2, 'Philosophical significance of Gödel's incompleteness results': "The accepted wisdom (with which I concur) is that the Lucas-Penrose arguments fail."&lt;/ref&gt; This consensus that Gödelian anti-mechanist arguments are doomed to failure is laid out strongly in ''[[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]]'': "''any'' attempt to utilize (Gödel's incompleteness results) to attack the [[computationalism|computationalist]] thesis is bound to be illegitimate, since these results are quite consistent with the computationalist thesis."&lt;ref name=laforte&gt;LaForte, G., Hayes, P. J., Ford, K. M. 1998. Why Gödel's theorem cannot refute computationalism. [[Artificial Intelligence (journal)|Artificial Intelligence]], 104:265-286, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

More pragmatically, Russell and Norvig note that Gödel's argument only applies to what can theoretically be proved, given an infinite amount of memory and time. In practice, real machines (including humans) have finite resources and will have difficulty proving many theorems. It is not necessary to prove everything in order to be intelligent {{Definition|date=April 2017}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}  They point out that real machines with finite memory can be modeled using [[propositional logic]], which is formally [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]], and Gödel's argument does not apply to them at all.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less formally, [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his [[Pulitzer prize]] winning book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid]],'' states that these "Gödel-statements" always refer to the system itself, drawing an analogy to the way the [[Epimenides paradox]] uses statements that refer to themselves, such as "this statement is false" or "I am lying".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, of course, the [[Epimenides paradox]] applies to anything that makes statements, whether they are machines ''or'' humans, even Lucas himself. Consider:
* ''Lucas can't assert the truth of this statement.''&lt;ref&gt;According to {{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, this statement was first proposed by [[C. H. Whiteley]]&lt;/ref&gt;
This statement is true but cannot be asserted by Lucas. This shows that Lucas himself is subject to the same limits that he describes for machines, as are all people, and so [[John Lucas (philosopher)|Lucas]]'s argument is pointless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofstadter|1979|pp=476–477}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=950}}, {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "The Argument from Mathematics" where he writes "although it is established that there are limitations to the powers of any particular machine, it has only been stated, without sort of proof, that no such limitations apply to the human intellect."&lt;/ref&gt;

After concluding that human reasoning is non-computable, Penrose went on to controversially speculate that some kind of hypothetical non-computable processes involving the collapse of [[quantum mechanical]] states give humans a special advantage over existing computers. Existing quantum computers are only capable of reducing the complexity of Turing computable tasks and are still restricted to tasks within the scope of Turing machines. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} {{Clarify|date=April 2017}}. By Penrose and Lucas's arguments, existing quantum computers are not sufficient {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}{{Why|date=April 2017}}, so Penrose seeks for some other process involving new physics, for instance quantum gravity which might manifest new physics at the scale of the [[Planck mass]] via spontaneous quantum collapse of the wave function.

=====Dreyfus: the primacy of implicit skills=====
{{Main|Dreyfus' critique of artificial intelligence}}

Hubert Dreyfus [[argued that human intelligence|Hubert Dreyfus's views on artificial intelligence]] and expertise depended primarily on implicit skill  rather than explicit symbolic manipulation, and argued that these skills would never be captured in formal rules.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1972}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979}}, {{Harvnb|Dreyfus|Dreyfus|1986}}. See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950–952}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|120-132}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hubert Dreyfus|Dreyfus]]'s argument had been anticipated by Turing in his 1950 paper [[Computing machinery and intelligence]], where he had classified this as the "argument from the informality of behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=950–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing argued in response that, just because we do not know the rules that govern a complex behavior, this does not mean that no such rules exist. He wrote: "we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(8) The Argument from the Informality of Behavior"&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell and [[Peter Norvig|Norvig]] point out that, in the years since Dreyfus published his critique, progress has been made towards discovering the "rules" that govern unconscious reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[situated]] movement in [[robotics]] research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Brooks|1990}} and {{Harvnb|Moravec|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computational intelligence]] paradigms, such as [[neural net]]s, [[evolutionary algorithm]]s and so on are mostly directed at simulated unconscious reasoning and learning. [[Artificial intelligence#Statistical|Statistical approaches to AI]] can make predictions which approach the accuracy of human intuitive guesses. Research into [[commonsense knowledge]] has focused on reproducing the "background" or context of knowledge. In fact, AI research in general has moved away from high level symbol manipulation or "[[GOFAI]]", towards new models that are intended to capture more of our ''unconscious'' reasoning {{According to whom|date=April 2017}}. Historian and AI researcher [[Daniel Crevier]] wrote that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier."&lt;ref name="Crevier 1993 p=125"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a philosophical question, related to the [[problem of other minds]] and the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. The question revolves around a position defined by [[John Searle]] as "strong AI":
* ''A physical symbol system can have a mind and mental states.''&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;
Searle distinguished this position from what he called "weak AI":
* ''A physical symbol system can act intelligently.''&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;
Searle introduced the terms to isolate strong AI from weak AI so he could focus on what he thought was the more interesting and debatable issue. He argued that ''even if we assume'' that we had a computer program that acted exactly like a human mind, there would still be a difficult philosophical question that needed to be answered.&lt;ref name=SWAI/&gt;

Neither of Searle's two positions are of great concern to AI research, since they do not directly answer the question "can a machine display general intelligence?" (unless it can also be shown that consciousness is ''necessary'' for intelligence). Turing wrote "I do not wish to give the impression that I think there is no mystery about consciousness… [b]ut I do not think these mysteries necessarily need to be solved before we can answer the question [of whether machines can think]."&lt;ref name=T4&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(4) The Argument from Consciousness". See also {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|pp=952–3}}, where they identify Searle's argument with Turing's "Argument from Consciousness."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart J. Russell|Russell]] and Norvig agree: "Most AI researchers take the weak AI hypothesis for granted, and don't care about the strong AI hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a few researchers who believe that consciousness is an essential element in intelligence, such as [[Igor Aleksander]], [[Stan Franklin]], [[Ron Sun]], and [[Artificial consciousness#Haikonen's cognitive architecture|Pentti Haikonen]], although their definition of "consciousness" strays very close to "intelligence." (See [[artificial consciousness]].)

Before we can answer this question, we must be clear what we mean by "minds", "mental states" and "consciousness".

===Consciousness, minds, mental states, meaning===

The words "[[mind]]" and "[[consciousness]]" are used by different communities in different ways. Some [[new age]] thinkers, for example, use the word "consciousness" to describe something similar to [[Bergson]]'s "[[élan vital]]": an invisible, energetic fluid that permeates life and especially the mind. [[Science fiction]] writers use the word to describe some [[essentialism|essential]] property that makes us human: a machine or alien that is "conscious" will be presented as a fully human character, with intelligence, desires, will, insight, pride and so on. (Science fiction writers also use the words "sentience", "sapience," "self-awareness" or "ghost" - as in the ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' manga and anime series - to describe this essential human property). For others {{Who|date=April 2017}}, the words "mind" or "consciousness" are used as a kind of secular synonym for the [[soul]].

For [[philosophy|philosophers]], [[neuroscience|neuroscientists]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive scientists]], the words are used in a way that is both more precise and more mundane: they refer to the familiar, everyday experience of having a "thought in your head", like a perception, a dream, an intention or a plan, and to the way we ''know'' something, or ''mean'' something or ''understand'' something {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}. "It's not hard to give a commonsense definition of consciousness" observes philosopher John Searle.&lt;ref&gt;"[P]eople always tell me it was very hard to define consciousness, but I think if you're just looking for the kind of commonsense definition that you get at the beginning of the investigation, and not at the hard nosed scientific definition that comes at the end, it's not hard to give commonsense definition of consciousness." [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/philosopherszone/stories/2006/1639491.htm The Philosopher's Zone: The question of consciousness]. Also see {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; What is mysterious and fascinating is not so much ''what'' it is but ''how'' it is: how does a lump of fatty tissue and electricity give rise to this (familiar) experience of perceiving, meaning or thinking?

[[Philosopher]]s call this the [[hard problem of consciousness]]. It is the latest version of a classic problem in the [[philosophy of mind]] called the "[[mind-body problem]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackmore|2005|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A related problem is the problem of ''meaning'' or ''understanding'' (which philosophers call "[[intentionality]]"): what is the connection between our ''thoughts'' and ''what we are thinking about'' (i.e. objects and situations out in the world)? A third issue is the problem of ''experience'' (or "[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]"): If two people see the same thing, do they have the same experience? Or are there things "inside their head" (called "[[qualia]]") that can be different from person to person?&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=954–956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neurobiologist]]s believe all these problems will be solved as we begin to identify the [[neural correlates of consciousness]]: the actual relationship between the machinery in our heads and its collective properties; such as the mind, experience and understanding. Some of the harshest critics of [[artificial intelligence]] agree that the brain is just a machine, and that consciousness and intelligence are the result of physical processes in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;For example, John Searle writes: "Can a machine think? The answer is, obvious, yes. We are precisely such machines." {{Harv|Searle|1980|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficult philosophical question is this: can a computer program, running on a digital machine that shuffles the binary digits of zero and one, duplicate the ability of the [[neural correlates of consciousness|neurons]] to create minds, with mental states (like understanding or perceiving), and ultimately, the experience of [[consciousness]]?

===Arguments that a computer cannot have a mind and mental states===

====Searle's Chinese room====
{{Main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] asks us to consider a [[thought experiment]]: suppose we have written a computer program that passes the Turing test and demonstrates "general intelligent action." Suppose, specifically that the program can converse in fluent Chinese. Write the program on 3x5 cards and give them to an ordinary person who does not speak Chinese. Lock the person into a room and have him follow the instructions on the cards. He will copy out Chinese characters and pass them in and out of the room through a slot. From the outside, it will appear that the Chinese room contains a fully intelligent person who speaks Chinese. The question is this: is there anyone (or anything) in the room that understands Chinese? That is, is there anything that has the mental state of [[understanding]], or which has [[consciousness|conscious]] [[awareness]] of what is being discussed in Chinese? The man is clearly not aware. The room cannot be aware. The ''cards'' certainly aren't aware. Searle concludes that the [[Chinese room]], or ''any'' other physical symbol system, cannot have a mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}}. See also {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|pp=958–960}}, {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|pp=269–272}} and {{Harvnb|Hearn|2007|pp=43–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Searle goes on to argue that actual mental states and [[consciousness]] require (yet to be described) "actual physical-chemical properties of actual human brains."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues there are special "causal properties" of [[brain]]s and [[neuron]]s that gives rise to [[mind]]s: in his words "brains cause minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Related arguments: Leibniz' mill, Davis's telephone exchange, Block's Chinese nation and Blockhead====

[[Gottfried Leibniz]] made essentially the same argument as Searle in 1714, using the thought experiment of expanding the brain until it was the size of a [[mill (factory)|mill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.1}}, {{Harvnb|Leibniz|1714|loc=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, [[Lawrence Davis]] imagined duplicating the brain using telephone lines and offices staffed by people, and in 1978 [[Ned Block]] envisioned the entire population of China involved in such a brain simulation. This thought experiment is called "the Chinese Nation" or "the Chinese Gym".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=2.3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ned Block also proposed his [[Blockhead argument]], which is a version of the [[Chinese room]] in which the program has been [[code refactoring|re-factored]] into a simple set of rules of the form "see this, do that", removing all mystery from the program.

==== Responses to the Chinese room ====

Responses to the Chinese room emphasize several different points. 
* '''The systems reply''' and the '''virtual mind reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "1. The Systems Reply (Berkeley)", {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=269}}, {{Harvnb|Russell|Norvig|2003|p=959}}, {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.1}}. Among those who hold to the "system" position (according to Cole) are Ned Block, [[Jack Copeland]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor]], [[John Haugeland]], [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Georges Rey]]. Those who have defended the "virtual mind" reply include [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Alan Perlis]], [[David Chalmers]], Ned Block and J. Cole (again, according to {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}})&lt;/ref&gt; This reply argues that ''the system'', including the man, the program, the room, and the cards, is what understands Chinese. Searle claims that the man in the room is the only thing which could possibly "have a mind" or "understand", but others disagree, arguing that it is possible for there to be ''two'' minds in the same physical place, similar to the way a computer can simultaneously "be" two machines at once: one physical (like a [[Macintosh]]) and one "[[virtual machine|virtual]]" (like a [[word processor]]).
*'''Speed, power and complexity replies''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.2}} ascribes this position to [[Ned Block]], Daniel Dennett, [[Tim Maudlin]], [[David Chalmers]], [[Steven Pinker]], [[Patricia Churchland]] and others.&lt;/ref&gt; Several critics point out that the man in the room would probably take millions of years to respond to a simple question, and would require "filing cabinets" of astronomical proportions. This brings the clarity of Searle's intuition into doubt.
*'''Robot reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "2. The Robot Reply (Yale)". {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.3}} ascribes this position to [[Margaret Boden]], [[Tim Crane]], Daniel Dennett, Jerry Fodor, [[Stevan Harnad]], Hans Moravec and [[Georges Rey]]&lt;/ref&gt; To truly understand, some believe the Chinese Room needs eyes and hands. Hans Moravec writes: 'If we could graft a robot to a reasoning program, we wouldn't need a person to provide the meaning anymore: it would come from the physical world."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Brain simulator reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "3. The Brain Simulator Reply (Berkeley and M.I.T.)" {{Harvnb|Cole|2004}} ascribes this position to [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]] and [[Ray Kurzweil]]&lt;/ref&gt; What if the program simulates the sequence of nerve firings at the synapses of an actual brain of an actual Chinese speaker? The man in the room would be simulating an actual brain. This is a variation on the "systems reply" that appears more plausible because "the system" now clearly operates like a human brain, which strengthens the intuition that there is something besides the man in the room that could understand Chinese.
*'''Other minds reply''' and the '''epiphenomena reply''':&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Searle|1980}} under "5. The Other Minds Reply", {{Harvnb|Cole|2004|loc=4.4}}. {{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} makes this reply under "(4) The Argument from Consciousness." Cole ascribes this position to Daniel Dennett and Hans Moravec.&lt;/ref&gt; Several people have noted that Searle's argument is just a version of the [[problem of other minds]], applied to machines. Since it is difficult to decide if people are "actually" thinking, we should not be surprised that it is difficult to answer the same question about machines.

:A related question is whether "consciousness" (as Searle understands it) exists. Searle argues that the experience of consciousness can't be detected by examining the behavior of a machine, a human being or any other animal. [[Daniel Dennett]] points out that natural selection cannot preserve a feature of an animal that has no effect on the behavior of the animal, and thus consciousness (as Searle understands it) can't be produced by natural selection. Therefore either natural selection did not produce consciousness, or "strong AI" is correct in that consciousness can be detected by suitably designed Turing test.

==Is thinking a kind of computation?==
{{Main|computational theory of mind}}

The [[computational theory of mind]] or "[[computationalism]]" claims that the relationship between mind and brain is similar (if not identical) to the relationship between a ''running program'' and a computer. The idea has philosophical roots in [[Hobbes]] (who claimed reasoning was "nothing more than reckoning"), [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] (who attempted to create a logical calculus of all human ideas), [[David Hume|Hume]] (who thought perception could be reduced to "atomic impressions") and even [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (who analyzed all experience as controlled by formal rules).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dreyfus|1979|p=156}}, {{Harvnb|Haugeland|1985|pp=15–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version is associated with philosophers [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Jerry Fodor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Horst|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This question bears on our earlier questions: if the human brain is a kind of computer then computers can be both intelligent and conscious, answering both the practical and philosophical questions of AI. In terms of the practical question of AI ("Can a machine display general intelligence?"), some versions of computationalism make the claim that (as [[Hobbes]] wrote):
* ''Reasoning is nothing but reckoning''&lt;ref name=H/&gt;
In other words, our intelligence derives from a form of ''calculation'', similar to [[arithmetic]]. This is the [[physical symbol system]] hypothesis discussed above, and it implies that artificial intelligence is possible. In terms of the philosophical question of AI ("Can a machine have mind, mental states and consciousness?"), most versions of [[computationalism]] claim that (as [[Stevan Harnad]] characterizes it):
* ''Mental states are just implementations of (the right) computer programs''&lt;ref name=HARNAD&gt;{{Harvnb|Harnad|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is John Searle's "strong AI" discussed above, and it is the real target of the [[Chinese room]] argument (according to [[Stevan Harnad|Harnad]]).&lt;ref name=HARNAD/&gt;

==Other related questions==

Alan Turing noted that there are many arguments of the form "a machine will never do X", where X can be many things, such as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Be kind, resourceful, beautiful, friendly, have initiative, have a sense of humor, tell right from wrong, make mistakes, fall in love, enjoy strawberries and cream, make someone fall in love with it, learn from experience, use words properly, be the subject of its own thought, have as much diversity of behaviour as a man, do something really new.&lt;ref name=T5&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(5) Arguments from Various Disabilities"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Turing argues that these objections are often based on naive assumptions about the versatility of machines or are "disguised forms of the argument from consciousness". Writing a program that exhibits one of these behaviors "will not make much of an impression."&lt;ref name=T5/&gt; All of these arguments are tangential to the basic premise of AI, unless it can be shown that one of these traits is essential for general intelligence.

===Can a machine have emotions?===

If "emotions" are defined only in terms of their effect on [[behaviorism|behavior]] or on how they [[function (biology)|function]] inside an organism, then emotions can be viewed as a mechanism that an [[intelligent agent]] uses to maximize the [[utility (economics)|utility]] of its actions. Given this definition of emotion, [[Hans Moravec]] believes that "robots in general will be quite emotional about being nice people".&lt;ref name=CQ266&gt;Quoted in {{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear is a source of urgency. Empathy is a necessary component of good [[human computer interaction]]. He says robots "will try to please you in an apparently selfless manner because it will get a thrill out of this positive reinforcement. You can interpret this as a kind of love."&lt;ref name=CQ266/&gt; [[Daniel Crevier]] writes "Moravec's point is that emotions are just devices for channeling behavior in a direction beneficial to the survival of one's species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Crevier|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, emotions can also be defined in terms of their [[Subjectivity|subjective]] quality, of what it ''feels like'' to have an emotion. The question of whether the machine ''actually feels'' an emotion, or whether it merely ''acts as if'' it is feeling an emotion is the philosophical question, "can a machine be conscious?" in another form.&lt;ref name=T4/&gt;

===Can a machine be self-aware?===

"Self awareness", as noted above, is sometimes used by [[science fiction]] writers as a name for the [[essentialism|essential]] human property that makes a character fully human. [[Alan Turing|Turing]] strips away all other properties of human beings and reduces the question to "can a machine be the subject of its own thought?" Can it ''think about itself''? Viewed in this way, a program can be written that can report on its own internal states, such as a [[debugger]].&lt;ref name=T5/&gt;  Though arguably self-awareness often presumes a bit more capability; a machine that can ascribe meaning in some way to not only its own state but in general postulating questions without solid answers: the contextual nature of its existence now; how it compares to past states or plans for the future, the limits and value of its work product, how it perceives its performance to be valued-by or compared to others.

===Can a machine be original or creative?===

Turing reduces this to the question of whether a machine can "take us by surprise" and argues that this is obviously true, as any programmer can attest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(6) Lady Lovelace's Objection"&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that, with enough storage capacity, a computer can behave in an astronomical number of different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(5) Argument from Various Disabilities"&lt;/ref&gt; It must be possible, even trivial, for a computer that can represent ideas to combine them in new ways. ([[Douglas Lenat]]'s [[Automated Mathematician]], as one example, combined ideas to discover new mathematical truths.) [[Andreas Kaplan|Kaplan]] and Haenlein suggest that machines can display scientific creativity, while it seems likely that humans will have the upper hand where artistic creativity is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007681318301393 Kaplan Andreas; Michael Haenlein (2018) Siri, Siri in my Hand, who's the Fairest in the Land? On the Interpretations, Illustrations and Implications of Artificial Intelligence, Business Horizons, 62(1)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, scientists at Aberystwyth University in Wales and the U.K's University of Cambridge designed a robot called Adam that they believe to be the first machine to independently come up with new scientific findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Katz |first=Leslie |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10211175-1.html?tag=newsLatestHeadlinesArea.0 |title=Robo-scientist makes gene discovery-on its own &amp;#124; Crave - CNET |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-04-02 |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2009, researchers at [[Cornell]] developed [[Eureqa]], a computer program that extrapolates formulas to fit the data inputted, such as finding the laws of motion from a pendulum's motion.

===Can a machine be benevolent or hostile?===
{{Main|ethics of artificial intelligence}}

This question (like many others in the philosophy of artificial intelligence) can be presented in two forms. "Hostility" can be defined in terms [[functionalism (philosophy)|function]] or [[behaviorism|behavior]], in which case "hostile" becomes synonymous with "dangerous". Or it can be defined in terms of intent: can a machine "deliberately" set out to do harm? The latter is the question "can a machine have conscious states?" (such as [[intention]]s) in another form.&lt;ref name=T4/&gt;

The question of whether highly intelligent and completely autonomous machines would be dangerous has been examined in detail by futurists (such as the [[Singularity Institute]]). (The obvious element of drama has also made the subject popular in [[science fiction]], which has considered many differently possible scenarios where intelligent machines pose a threat to mankind.)

One issue is that machines may acquire the autonomy and intelligence required to be dangerous very quickly. [[Vernor Vinge]] has suggested that over just a few years, computers will suddenly become thousands or millions of times more intelligent than humans. He calls this "[[Technological singularity|the Singularity]]."&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"/&gt;  He suggests that it may be somewhat or possibly very dangerous for humans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070101133646/http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html The Coming Technological Singularity: How to Survive in the Post-Human Era], by Vernor Vinge, Department of Mathematical Sciences, San Diego State University, (c) 1993 by Vernor Vinge.&lt;/ref&gt; This is discussed by a philosophy called [[Singularitarianism]].

In 2009, academics and technical experts attended a conference to discuss the potential impact of robots and computers and the impact of the hypothetical possibility that they could become self-sufficient and able to make their own decisions. They discussed the possibility and the extent to which computers and robots might be able to acquire any level of autonomy, and to what degree they could use such abilities to possibly pose any threat or hazard. They noted that some machines have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some experts and academics have questioned the use of robots for military combat, especially when such robots are given some degree of autonomous functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8182003.stm Call for debate on killer robots], By Jason Palmer, Science and technology reporter, BBC News, 8/3/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Navy has funded a report which indicates that as military robots become more complex, there should be greater attention to implications of their ability to make autonomous decisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm Science New Navy-funded Report Warns of War Robots Going "Terminator"], by Jason Mick (Blog), dailytech.com, February 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.engadget.com/2009/02/18/navy-report-warns-of-robot-uprising-suggests-a-strong-moral-com/ Navy report warns of robot uprising, suggests a strong moral compass], by Joseph L. Flatley  engadget.com, Feb 18th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The President of the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] has commissioned a study to look at this issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/horvitz/AAAI_Presidential_Panel_2008-2009.htm AAAI Presidential Panel on Long-Term AI Futures 2008-2009 Study], Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, Accessed 7/26/09.&lt;/ref&gt; They point to programs like the [[Language Acquisition Device (computer)|Language Acquisition Device]] which can emulate human interaction.

Some have suggested a need to build "[[Friendly AI]]", meaning that the advances which are already occurring with AI should also include an effort to make AI intrinsically friendly and humane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html Article at Asimovlaws.com], July 2004, accessed 7/27/09. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090630002221/http://www.asimovlaws.com/articles/archives/2004/07/why_we_need_fri_1.html |date=June 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Can a machine have a soul?===

Finally, those who believe in the existence of a soul may argue that "Thinking is a function of man's immortal soul." Alan Turing called this "the theological objection". He writes
&lt;blockquote&gt;In attempting to construct such machines we should not be irreverently usurping His power of creating souls, any more than we are in the procreation of children: rather we are, in either case, instruments of His will providing mansions for the souls that He creates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1950}} under "(1) The Theological Objection", although it should be noted that he also writes "I am not very impressed with theological arguments whatever they may be used to support"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Views on the role of philosophy==
Some scholars argue that the AI community's dismissal of philosophy is detrimental. In the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', some philosophers argue that  the role of philosophy in AI is underappreciated.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Physicist [[David Deutsch]] argues that without an understanding of philosophy or its concepts, AI development would suffer from a lack of progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/oct/03/philosophy-artificial-intelligence|title=Philosophy will be the key that unlocks artificial intelligence {{!}} David Deutsch|last=Deutsch|first=David|date=2012-10-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Propaganda in [[Iran]]''' originates from the Iranian government and "private" entities, which are usually state controlled.

Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell have provided a concise, workable definition of [[propaganda]]: "Propaganda is the deliberate, systematic attempt to shape perceptions, manipulate cognitions, and direct behavior to achieve a response that furthers the desired intent of the propagandist."&lt;ref&gt;Garth Jowett and Victoria O'Donnell, Propaganda and Persuasion, 4th ed. Sage Publications, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda can be disseminated through any medium, television, film, newspaper, posters, murals, political actions, rallies, violence, and websites.  [[Propaganda]] in [[Iran|The Islamic Republic of Iran]] is also about the information that is not broadcast to the masses due to [[censorship]].



==Censorship in Iran==

{{see also| Censorship in Iran}}
One of the biggest issues Iran is criticized for is censorship.  Aided by Western technology from [[Nokia]] and [[Siemens]], the Iranian government has created one of the most sophisticated censorship platforms created in modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rhoads|first=Christopher|title=Iran's Web SPying Aided By Western Technology: European Gear Used in Vast Effort to Monitor Communications|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124562668777335653.html|publisher=The Wallstreet Journal|accessdate=2011-11-30|date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

=== Symbolism ===
[[Image:US Embassy Tehran.JPG|thumb|The defaced [[Great Seal of the United States]] in 2004.  The [[Iconoclasm]] shown is a form of propaganda]]

==== Flag ====
[[File:Teheran US embassy propaganda gun.jpg|thumb|Tehran US embassy propaganda gun]]
The flags of nations are considered propaganda.  Not only is the flag itself a representation of [[propaganda]], but the flags of other nations, such as the United States and Israel, are used in Iranian Propaganda.  Burning of the U.S. flag and Israeli Flag seem to occur at rallies against each.  Flag burning is a propaganda tool, such as burning [[Effigy|Effigies]] of world leaders.


=== Violence/Fear ===

On October 8, 2006, cleric [[Hossein Kazemeyni Boroujerdi|Seyyed Hossein Kazemeini Boroujerdi]] was arrested for opposing Velaayat-e Faghih, advocating the separation of religion from state, and defending the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/10/irgc-propaganda-arm-includes-15000-reporters.html|title=Intel Chief: No Link Between $3Bil and Mashaei; IRGC 'Reporter' Training|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;\

=== Judicial system of Iran ===
[[Judicial system of Iran|Iranian Justice System]] has also been known to espouse propaganda. This is especially true in the [[Judicial system of Iran#Prison system|prison system of Iran]] where Political prisoners were "incessantly bombarded with propaganda from all sides ... radio and closed-circuit television ... loudspeakers blaring into all cells even into solitary cells and `the coffins` [where some prisoners were kept] ... ideological sessions." Any reading material of a secular nature such as Western novelists, or even religious material that didn't agree ideologically with the Islamic Republic such as work by [[Ali Shariati]] was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abrahamian|first=Ervand|title=Tortured confessions : prisons and public recantations in modern Iran|date=16 June 2008|publisher=Univ. of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.

=== The Basij ===
The [[Basij]] are the local and grassroot supporters of the Iranian government.  "The mission of the [[Basij]] as a whole can be broadly defined as helping to maintain law and order; enforcing ideological and Islamic values and combating the "Western cultural onslaught"; assisting the IRGC in defending the country against foreign threats; and involvement in state-run economic projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/Irans_Basij_Force_Mainstay_Of_Domestic_Security/1357081.html|title=Pillar Of The State|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the IRGC's help and support, [[Basij]] members are trained in propaganda and political warfare techniques using media outlets.  There are about 21,000 volunteer "reporters" that have trained with the IRGC on multiple waves of communication and media, which include social networks, television, radio, print media, and the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=13900715000326|title=خبرگزاری فارس - سازماندهی 21 هزار خبرنگار افتخاری در بسیج|date=7 October 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], "In Iran, the Revolutionary Guards recently announced their ambition to build their own spinternet by launching 10,000 blogs for the Basij, a paramilitary force under the Guards. This comes at a time when the Internet has become a major force in exposing corruption in the highest ranks of the Iranian leadership."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morozov|first=Evgeny|title=Propaganda.com|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/opinion/30iht-edmorozov.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2011-11-28|date=30 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As well, cyber-police "are here to create a cyber police force inside the people’s mind,” said Hesamedin Mojtahed, the officer in charge of the booth. “People want to be informed of the dangers on the Internet,” he said. “We are here for them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Erdbrink|first=Thomas|title=Iran Cyber Police Cite U.S. Threat|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-cyber-police-cite-us-threat/2011/10/27/gIQA1yruSM_story_1.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2011-11-28|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Military ===
The [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]], a special unit within the [[Military of Iran|Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] has practiced for [[PSYOP|Psychological Operations]] against military targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8908291226 |title=Iran Uses Psychological Operations in Massive Air Drills |accessdate=2011-11-17|agency=FARS News Agency|date=20 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ayatollah Khamenei, "the main priority of the country is to confront (enemy's) soft warfare which is aimed at creating doubt, discord and pessimism among the masses of the people," Ayatollah Khamenei said last year, addressing a large and fervent congregation of Basij (volunteer) forces."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8908291226# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209171553/http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=8908291226# |archive-date=2011-12-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media of Iran ==

=== Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting ===
[[IRIB|Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] is the sole, official provider, of broadcast [[news]] to both the Iranian people and the rest of the world.  [[IRIB]] operates many channels in a multitude of languages and is known to broadcast [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1906187,00.html | work=Time | first=Azadeh | last=Moaveni | title=State Television Becomes a Focus for Iranian Anger | date=22 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- LONG FOOTNOTE ENDS --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Taheri|first=Amir|title=Propaganda War Latest: Tehran 3 Israel 0|newspaper=The Times (London)|date=June 8, 2010|type=Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- LONG FOOTNOTE ENDS --&gt;  [[IRIB]] is the main hub for which all Iranian propaganda is created, and disseminated, throughout the world.  The multiple channels that make up [[IRIB]] all have a specific purpose.
*On every [[IRIB]] channel, Israel is referred to as the "Zionist Regime".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/07/27/opinion/main3105225.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Iran's Propaganda Purveyors}}&lt;/ref&gt;



=== Conferences and Lectures ===
Ahmadinejad's visit to Cornell was exclusively for propaganda purposes.  Ahmadinejad firmly believes he can convince global opinion and the American people of the rightness of his cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran president in NY campus row|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7010962.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-11-30|author=BBC|format=Web Page|date=25 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bonifield|first=Alexandra|title=Ahmadinejad visit, speech part of propaganda machine|newspaper=USA Today|date=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- LONG FOOTNOTE ENDS --&gt;

The Islamic Republic of Iran held an anti-terrorism conference which featured representatives from "neighboring countries Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan as well as Sudan, Tajikistan, Mauritania and the Vice-President of Cuba and Ministers and other high-level delegates from 60 States, representatives of the United Nations (Officer in Charge of CTITF), the OIC, and other regional organizations as well as distinguished scholars and researchers and peace activists from all around the world participated in the Conference."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9004052538# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728074839/http://english.farsnews.com/newstext.php?nn=9004052538# |archive-date=2011-07-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With Iran being a state-sponsor of terrorist activities, and many of the nations in attendance, including many of the African representatives, users of terrorism, the anti-terrorism conference is propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/policy/editorials/middle-east/Iranian-Government--124890829.html|title=Editorials on Voice of America|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/un-chief-actually-applauds-iranian-counterterrorism-conference-bashing-us-uk-israeli-regime/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903055322/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/un-chief-actually-applauds-iranian-counterterrorism-conference-bashing-us-uk-israeli-regime/# |archive-date=2011-09-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unwatch.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwatch.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=bdKKISNqEmG&amp;b=1319279&amp;ct=10890065|title=Page not found|website=UN Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was quite successful as well because the [[United Nations]] endorsed the meeting and sent a delegation to partake in the event.&lt;ref name="unwatch.org"/&gt;  During the event, "Iran's Supreme leader Ali Khamenei took the opportunity to excoriate western nations for "terrorist behaviors," and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad expressed his doubts about the September 2001 terrorist attacks on America – outrageously claiming that the U.S has benefited from those attacks, as it has, he added, from the Holocaust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iranian Government Holds Terrorism Conference|url=http://www.voanews.com/policy/editorials/middle-east/Iranian-Government--124890829.html|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=12/1/2011|author=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cyber Police ====
{{see also|Internet censorship|Internet censorship by country}}
Iran has created a [[Iranian Cyber Police|Cyber Police]] unit in January 2011, known by the acronym FATA. Since then it has arrested several bloggers critical of Iran’s leaders, as well as a group of youths who had created a “hot or not” contest on Facebook rating profile pictures of boys and girls&lt;ref name=not&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/13/world/middleeast/iran-says-sattar-beheshti-was-not-tortured-before-death.html?_r=0 Jailed Blogger Not Tortured Before Death, Iran Says]| By THOMAS ERDBRINK
|November 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was created to "control which sites Iranians are able to visit, to prevent spying and protect the public from `immoral` material. The United States, they charge, is waging a `soft war` against Iran by reaching out to Iranians online and inciting them to overthrow their leaders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-cyber-police-cite-us-threat/2011/10/27/gIQA1yruSM_story.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Iran cyber police cite U.S. threat | date=29 October 2011 | first=William | last=Wan}}&lt;/ref&gt; ".  From the Iranian regime's standpoint, any free information is a threat to power.  The internet was a major factor for organizing and showing the world what was happening during the 2009 presidential election.  The United States asked [[Twitter]] to postpone online maintenance  in 2009 so that it would be available for Iranian protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Erdbrink|first=Thomas|title=Iran cyber police cite U.S. threat|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/iran-cyber-police-cite-us-threat/2011/10/27/gIQA1yruSM_story.html|accessdate=2011-11-30|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 1 December 2012, General Saeed Shokrian, commander of FATA, was dismissed by Iranian’s national police chief, Ismael Ahmadi-Moqaddam, for negligence in death of blogger [[Sattar Beheshti]] while in FATA custody one month earlier. The dismissal followed international outcry over the death. Shokrian stated “Tehran’s FATA should be held responsible for the death of Sattar Beheshti”.&lt;ref name=fired&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/world/middleeast/after-death-of-sattar-beheshti-iranian-blogger-head-of-tehrans-cybercrimes-unit-is-fired.html?_r=0 Head of Tehran’s Cybercrimes Unit Is Fired Over Death of Blogger]| By THOMAS ERDBRINK| nytimes.com| 1 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Alavi Foundation]] is the successor organization to the Pahlavi Foundation, a nonprofit group used by Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to advance Iran's charitable interests in America. Most of the charities income is from rent collected on the New York Fifth Avenue skyscraper the Piaget Building, which was built in 1978 under the Shah, who was overthrown in 1979.

The [[FBI]] laid out a case against the [[Alavi Foundation]] that it was being used as a [[front group]] for the Iranian government. It was built in the 1970s by the [[Mostazafen Foundation of Islamic Revolution#Pahlavi Foundation|Pahlavi Foundation]] to further the interest of then Shah of Iran, [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Michael|title=What's known about Iran-linked Alavi Foundation?|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2009/1114/p02s10-usgn.html|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=12/1/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the tenants of the foundation's properties are Islamic centers and schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glovin|first=David|title=Alavi Foundation Is Iran Front, U.S. Says in Lawsuit (Correct)|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aA6SZIk_JW04|publisher=Bloomberg News|accessdate=12/1/2011|date=30 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quadrille dress is the [[folk costume]] of [[Jamaica]], [[Dominica]] and [[Haiti]]. It is known by a different name in each country.  The dress is worn during the [[quadrille]] dance.

==Jamaica==
In [[Jamaica]], the quadrille dress is made of cotton. It's called a ''bandana skirt.''  The skirt is worn with a ruffled sleeve blouse and a matching [[head tie]]. The traditional dress is made out of red and white cotton plaid, maroon and white plaid,  or [[Madras (cloth)|madras]].&lt;ref name="My Island Jamaica"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.my-island-jamaica.com/jamaican_costumes.html|title=Jamaican costumes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plaid material  is called ''bandana fabric''.  Men wear a shirt made out of the same fabric and white pants during [[quadrille]] and folk dances.&lt;ref name="Everyculture"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Ha-La/Jamaican-Americans.html|title=Jamaican-Americans}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, for weddings, the traditional male attire is a [[Guayabera|bush jacket]] made of [[linen]] fabric and black dress pants &lt;ref name="Jamaica Gleaner"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20071111/arts/arts1.html|title=Spanish Artists Showcase Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[Black tie|tuxedo]] and the female attire is a white [[wedding dress]]. In many countries, the bush jacket is known as a guayabera.&lt;ref name="justlinen"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justlinen.com/blog/?p=27|title=The LinGuayabera:  Traditional Wedding Attire or High Fashion Wedding Attire}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Africa, the bush jacket is known as a safari shirt and is worn in the same manner as the [[safari jacket]].

The quadrille is only danced in Jamaica and Trinidad today as a show.  Dancers will usually wear the Jamaican folk costume, which consist of a gathered skirt of red madras bandana worn with a white peasant blouse.  A matching head scarf is often worn tied in a sort of turban fashion.  This costume is unlikely to be "bespoke" as it is only worn as a costume, for dancers, folk singers, tour guides etc. It represents the clothing worn by the ordinary folk in roughly the eighteenth century.  Sometimes beauty pageant contestants wear creative evening dresses inspired by the national costume. 

The bush jacket is hardly traditional.  It was introduced for political reasons in the 1970s and some men continue to wear it as a matter of taste.  Traditional attire for weddings, funerals, court dates etc. is an ordinary suit. Office attire is either a suit or shirt and tie.   The bush jacket is an option one sees occasionally. 

One would not expect to see the folk costume at a wedding.  The groom would wear a conventional suit, the bride a fashionable white gown.  Guests would wear suits and semi-formal dresses.  One or two of the men may wear bush jackets. 

The only occasion where a man would wear a madras shirt and white trousers would be if he were performing on the stage, either singing traditional folk songs or some sort of calypso or mento in the tourist circuit.

==Haiti==
In [[Haiti]], the quadrille dress is called a '''karabela dress'''.  Traditional male attire for dances, weddings, and other [[formal wear]] is the linen [[guayabera|shirt jacket]].

==St. Lucia==
In [[St. Lucia]], the name of the dress is spelled '''Kwadril dress'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1335">'''Saka Hoard''' is a silver [[hoard]] discovered in 2015 in [[Saka, Estonia]]. It consists of two neck rings and two spiral rings made of silver.

The hoard was discovered by an amateur archaeologist using a [[metal detector]] on 31 August 2015. He immediately informed Estonian authorities and helped them uncover the hoard. The archaeologists discovered no traces of any settlement close to the deposit, and as it contained no coins the deposit has been dated on stylistic grounds. It has been estimated that the hoard was deposited at the early 12th century or during the 11th century. It consists of two neck rings, weighing {{convert|193|g|oz}} and {{convert|150|g|oz}} respectively, and two spiral rings weighing {{convert|104|g|oz}} and {{convert|102|g|oz}}. The finding indicates that the hoard was deliberately buried.&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tamla|first= Ülle|last2= |first2= |date= 2015|title= Saka Late Viking Age silver hoard from north-east Estonia|url= https://www.etis.ee/File/DownloadPublic/e9b2a324-aa3c-4ecd-8d32-c8218b43eb4b?name=AVE2015_11_Tamla_Saka.pdf&amp;type=application%2Fpdf|journal= Archaeological Fieldwork in Estonia|volume= |issue= |pages= 113-120|doi= |access-date=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Announcement NoTimeGiven NewEnglandTelephoneTelegraph CambridgeTribule CambridgeTribune 1918June08.png|right|thumb|upright=1.4|Newspaper notice (1918) warning telephone subscribers that New England Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company operators will soon refuse to provide time of day on subscriber request.]]

A '''speaking clock''' or '''talking clock''' is a live or recorded human voice service, usually accessed by telephone, that gives the correct [[time]]. The first telephone speaking clock service was introduced in France, in association with the [[Paris Observatory]], on 14 February 1933.&lt;ref name=Syrte&gt;{{cite web|url=https://syrte.obspm.fr/spip/services/ref-temps/article/l-horloge-parlante-officielle-francaise-de-l-observatoire-de-paris|title=(fr) Paris Observatory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The format of the service is similar to that of radio [[time signal]] services. At set intervals (''e.g''. ten seconds) a voice announces (for example) "At the third stroke, the time will be twelve forty-six and ten seconds...", with three beeps following. Some countries have sponsored time announcements and include the sponsor's name in the message.

== ASEAN ==
{{Update|section|inaccurate=yes|date=October 2017}}
In 1995, the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] has set up nine speaking clocks.

*Brunei
*Cambodia
*Indonesia
*Laos
*Malaysia 1051 (within [[Kuala Lumpur]]), 03-1051 (from other states), +60-3-1051 (from other countries), 1052 (English)
*Philippines
*Singapore 171 (English) (1711 if called from other ASEAN countries, +65-171 from other countries), 172 (Chinese), 173 (Tamil)
*Thailand 181 (1811 if called from other ASEAN countries, +66-181 from other countries), 182 for English{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}
*Vietnam

The voice is computer-generated in ten languages: Chinese (Singapore), English (every country), Indonesian (Indonesia), Khmer (Cambodia), Lao (Laos), Malay (Malaysia, Brunei), Tagalog (Philippines), Tamil (Singapore), Thai (Thailand) and Vietnamese (Vietnam).

This service replaced services in [[Malaysia]] (owned by F3), [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]] and [[Thailand]] (owned by the navy), which already had speaking clock services.

== Argentina ==
In Argentina, users can reach the automatic time service dialing 113 from almost every fixed line operator.

== Australia ==
In Australia, the number 1194 gives the speaking clock in all areas and from all providers.  It is always the current time from where the call originates. A male voice, often known by Australians as George,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/at-the-third-stroke-george-the-talking-clock-now-on-atomic-time-20140404-3646r.html |title=At the third stroke: George the talking clock now on atomic time |publisher=SMH |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; says "At the third stroke, it will be (hours) (minutes) and (seconds) seconds/precisely. (three beeps)" e.g. "At the third stroke, it will be three thirty three and forty seconds ...  beep beep beep".  These are done in 10 second increments and the beep is 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.

[[File:Speakingclock.JPG|right|thumb|Mechanical speaking clock at the [[Victorian Telecommunications Museum]]]]
Prior to automatic systems, the subscriber rang an operator who would quote the time from a central clock in the exchange with a phrase such as "The time by the exchange clock is...". This was not precise and the operator could not always answer when the subscriber wanted. In 1954, British-made systems were installed in [[Melbourne]] and [[Sydney]]. The mechanical speaking clock used rotating glass discs where different parts of the time were recorded on the disc. A synchronous motor drove the disc with the driving source derived from a 5&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Crystal oscillator|quartz oscillator]] via a multi stage [[Vacuum tube|valve]] divider. This was [[Amplifier|amplified]] to give sufficient impetus to drive the motor. Because of the low torque available, a hand wheel was used to spin the motor on start up. The voice was provided by [[Gordon Gow]]. The units were designed for continuous operation. Both units in Melbourne and Sydney were run in tandem (primary and backup). For [[daylight saving time]] changes, one would be on line while the second was advanced or delayed by one hour and at the 02:00:00 Australian Eastern Standard time, would be switched over to the standby unit.

As well as the speaking clocks, there was ancillary equipment to provide timing signals, 1 pulse per second, 8 pulses per minute and 8 pulses per hour. The Time and Frequency Standards Section in the PMG Research Laboratories at 59 Little Collins Street, Melbourne maintained the frequency checks to ensure that the system was "on time". From a maintenance point of view, the most important part of the mechanical clocks was to ensure that they were well oiled to minimise wear on the cams and to replace blown bulbs in the optical pickups from the glass disk recordings. When Time &amp; Frequency Standards moved from 59 Collins Street to Clayton, the control signals were duplicated and a second bank of [[Caesium standard|Caesium Beam]] [[Atomic clock|Primary standards]] installed so the cutover was transparent with no loss of service.

[[File:Speakingclock2.JPG|right|thumb|Assmann digital speaking clock at the [[Victorian Telecommunications Museum]]]]This mechanical system was replaced with a [[Digital data|digital]] system in 1990. Each speaking clock ensemble consisted of two announcing units (Zag 500), a supervisory unit (CCU 500), two phase-locked oscillators, two pulse distribution units, a Civil Time Receiver (plus a spare), and two or four Computime 1200 baud [[modem]]s. The voice was provided by [[Richard Peach]], a former ABC broadcaster. The various components were sent for commercial production after a working prototype was built in the [[Telstra]] Research Laboratory (TRL). Assmann Australia used a German announcing unit and built a supervisory unit to TRL specifications. Design 2000 incorporated TRL oscillators in the phase locked oscillator units designed at TRL and controlled by two tone from the Telstra Caesium beam frequency standards. Ged Company built civil time receivers. The civil time code generators and two tone generators were designed and built within TRL. The changeover occurred at 11:59:52, September 12, 1990.

Each state capital had a digital speaking clock for the local time of day with one access number for all Australia, 1194. In 2002 the Telstra 1194 service was migrated to [[Informatel]] (which uses its own digital technology, in conjunction with the [[National Measurement Institute, Australia|National Measurement Institute]]&amp;nbsp;— but kept the original voice of [[Richard Peach]]), whilst the other time services (e.g. hourly pips to radio stations) were retained as a service by Telstra. In May 2006 the remaining Telstra services were withdrawn and the [[digital electronics|digital hardware]] was decommissioned.&lt;ref name="TRL history"&gt;''Telstra Research Laboratory Internal web page''&lt;/ref&gt; The 1194 service, though no longer provided by Telstra, is still operated by Informatel in partnership with Telstra.

== Austria ==
In [[Austria]], the speaking clock ("Zeitansage", which literally means "time announcement") can be reached at 0810 00 1503 since 2009. A recorded female voice says (for instance): "Es wird mit dem Summerton 15 Uhr, 53 Minuten und 10 Sekunden", meaning "At the buzzing tone, the time will be 15 hours, 53 minutes and 10 seconds", followed by a short pause and a 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, 0.25 seconds long beep (even though the announcement "buzzing tone" suggests otherwise). The time is announced in 10 second intervals.
Before 2009, the speaking clock was available by dialing 1503. Until there, the voice was generated by an Assmann ZAG500, which was also used in Australia. This has been replaced by a voice server.

== Barbados ==

In Barbados, daily time and temperature conditions are provided by the firm Accuweather and can obtained by the number +1.246.976.8463.  Daily weather conditions are now at a separate number +1.246.976.2376.

== Belgium ==

In Belgium, the speaking clock used to be reachable on the numbers 1200 (Dutch language), 1300 (French language), and 1400 (German language). Starting September 2012, the service is only reachable on the numbers +32 78 05 12 00 (Dutch Language), +32 78 05 13 00 (French language) and +32 78 05 14 00 (German language). At the time of the number change, the service received 5000 calls per day. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.be/article/134737/sprekende-klok-krijgt-langer-telefoonnummer|title=Sprekende klok krijgt langer telefoonnummer - ZDNet.be|date=26 December 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brazil ==

In Brazil, the user can access a non-free Speaking clock service, dialing the "130" number.

==Cambodia==

In [[Cambodia]], the speaking clock number is 107 for [[Phnom Penh]] and 023-107 for other provinces. The call rate is [[Cambodian riel|KHR]] 300 per minute in [[Phnom Penh]].

== Canada ==
{{Main|National Research Council Time Signal}}

In [[Canada]], the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] (NRC) is the federal agency responsible for official time.

NRC time is referred to its primary cesium atomic clocks designed, built, and maintained at the NRC time standards laboratory in [[Ottawa]].

The NRC provides a Telephone Talking Clock service; voice announcements of [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]] are made every 10 seconds, followed by a tone indicating the exact time.  This service is available to the general public by dialing +1 613 745-1576 for English service and +1 613 745-9426 for French service. [[Long-distance calling|Long-distance]] charges apply for those calling from outside the Ottawa/Gatineau area.  The voices of the time announcements are [[Harry Mannis]] in English and [[Simon Durivage]] in French.

The NRC also offers [[CHU (radio station)|CHU]] as a continuous shortwave time broadcast, and an FM broadcast time signal once daily at 1:00 pm EST on the main [[CBC Radio One]] and [[Première Chaîne]] networks.

==Chile==

The [[Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy]] provides a toll-free speaking clock at +56 (800) 800 780.

==China==

Dialing 117 in any city connects to a speaking clock that tells you the current Beijing Time.  If you dial 117 via a landline or mobile phone in the country, you will still be charged for communication. Rates are charged according to the ordinary local number, generally around 0.25 RMB/minute. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://greenwichmeantime.com/time-zone/asia/china/telephone-china/|title=China Telephones|accessdate=2017-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Please note that despite the vast area of China, all areas keep the [[Time in China|same time]].

==Colombia==
In [[Bogotá]], ETB provides a speaking clock service which can be reached by dialing 117 from a landline phone

==Czech Republic==
In the [[Czech Republic]], the speaking clock can be reached by dialing 14112.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.o2.cz/osobni/en/contacts/203475-dulezita_telefonni_cisla.html |title=O2 &amp;#124; Important numbers - Contact us |publisher=O2.cz |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Denmark ==
The Danish telephone company KTAS introduced the automated time service ''Frøken Klokken'' (Miss Clock) in 1939, originally voiced by telephonist Anna Edith Sommer-Jensen (1918–2008). In 1970, a new system used the voice recordings of Marianne Germers. The service was digitised in 1993.

The TDC Speaking Clock can be heard by calling +45 70 10 11 55 outside Denmark and on 70 10 11 55 within Denmark.

== Finland ==
[[Image:Machinery of Neiti Aika in Rupriikki Media Museum.JPG|thumb|Neiti Aika (speaking clock) at [[Rupriikki Media Museum]] in [[Tampere]], Finland]]
In Finland the speaking clock service is known as ''Neiti Aika'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] or ''Fröken Tid'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], both of which mean "Miss Time". The first Neiti Aika service was started in 1936 and was the first automated phone service in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helsingin Sanomat]] / Kulttuuri, 3.5.2002, [http://www.hs.fi/kirjat/artikkeli/Sellainen+on+puhelin/HS20020503SI1KU03b9y Sellainen on puhelin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012232303/http://www.hs.fi/kirjat/artikkeli/Sellainen+on+puhelin/HS20020503SI1KU03b9y |date=2007-10-12 }} (in finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; The service is provided by regional phone companies and can be reached by dialling 10061 in the whole country. The voice of the speaking clock can be male or female depending on whose phone company service you are using.&lt;ref name=mr_aika&gt;''[[Turun Sanomat]]'', 29.10.2004, [http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2004-10-29,104:2:261825,1:0:0:0:0:0: Neiti Aika vaihtui herraksi Satakunnassa] (in finnish)&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays the use of the Neiti Aika service has decreased pretty much to null and the press officer of [[TeliaSonera|Auria]], the regional phone company of [[Turku]], stated in an article of the ''[[Turun Sanomat]]'' newspaper that when the company started the service in 1938 it was used 352,310 times in its starting year compared to 1300 times in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[[Turun Sanomat]], 29.10.2006, [http://www.turunsanomat.fi/ajassa/?ts=1,3:1007:0:0,4:7:0:1:2006-10-29,104:7:415317,1:0:0:0:0:0: Ajalla monta näyttäjää Turussa - Oi aikoja, oi tapoja tsekata se] (in finnish)&lt;/ref&gt;

== France ==
In [[France]], the speaking clock (''horloge parlante'') has been in service since 14 February 1933.&lt;ref name=Syrte/&gt; It is available on 36.99 from within France, and was formerly available from overseas by dialing +33 8.36.99.xx.xx (where x could be anything).  However, since September 2011 a call placed from outside France or its territories yields only a recording indicating that the number is no longer available.

== Germany ==
In [[Germany]], the speaking clock from [[Deutsche Telekom]] is available by dialling 0180 4 100 100. At the beginning of the call, the date is announced.

Another speaking clock service based in Hamburg is available by dialling 040 42 89 90 within Germany and +49 40 42 89 90 from abroad.  Just the normal fixed line phone rate applies.  This services just announces what the time will be at the tone in German, in  a similar style to the English language services.

==Greece==

In Greece, the speaking clock can be heard by calling 14814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.speaking-clock.com/videos.php |title=Speaking clock Video |publisher=Speaking-clock.com |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iceland ==
The Icelandic speaking clock service ("klukkan"), provided by [[Síminn]], can be reached by dialing (+354) 155.

== Iran ==
All over the country, calling 20119 will connect people to the speaking clock in Persian language.

== Ireland ==
The [[Eir (telecommunications)|Eir]] speaking clock was permanently closed down on 27 August 2018. The standardised service, introduced in July 1970, ran for some 48 years. It was originally reached by dialling the short code 191, later changed to 1191.

The format used was an announcement at 10 second intervals saying: "At the signal it will be, HH:MM and XX seconds" followed by a short high-pitched tone.

== Israel ==
All over the country calling 1455 will connect to the speaking clock in Hebrew or English provided by [[Bezeq]].

== Japan ==
The Japanese telephone company [[Nippon Telegraph and Telephone|NTT]] provides a non-free speaking clock on the nationally universal number 117&lt;ref&gt;described at [[:ja:時報#電話]] (ja) Retrieved on {{date|2017-06-24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Latvia ==
The non-free [[Lattelecom]] speaking clock is provided in both [[Latvian language|Latvian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] languages and can be reached by dialing either (+371) 82154 or 82174, respectively. The precise time is given immediately upon connection, rather than after a certain signal.&lt;ref name="lattelecom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lattelecom.lv/?cat_id=544|title=Mājai - lattelecom.lv|website=www.lattelecom.lv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaysia==
In [[Malaysia]], there are two speaking clock services.  The first one is obtained by dialling 1051, which is owned by [[Sirim|SIRIM Berhad]], another one can ve heard by calling 181, which is owned by [[LKS Group]], a private group of companies. Both are available only in [[Malay language]].

== Netherlands ==
On 1 October 1930, a system was installed in the [[Haarlem]] telephone exchange (automated in 1925) which indicated the time using series of tones, with number 15290.&lt;ref&gt;Weet u misschien ook...?, Historisch overzicht van het telecomdistrict Haarlem, J. Wurkum, 5 maart 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, electronic engineer and inventor F.H. Leeuwrik was requested to build a speaking clock for the municipal telephone service of [[The Hague]]. His experience with [[sound film]] made him decide to use optically recorded speech, looping on a large drum. There were loops for the hours and for the minutes, each one read with a [[photodetector]]. Every minute the clock gave an electric pulse, causing the mechanism to shift to the next minute. Every hour, the minute mechanism was reset (and every day the hour mechanism), the clock was accurate within one minute only. The female voice was provided by the then 24-year-old school teacher Cor Hoogendam, hence the machine was nicknamed ''Tante Cor'' (Aunt Cor). The speaking clock came into service at November 9, 1934 and could be reached by dialing 393131. The service became so popular, that in 1935 a second machine was ordered and built. In total F.H. Leeuwrik built 19 machines, one for each telephone district. Starting with the [['s-Hertogenbosch]] exchange in 1941,&lt;ref name="doorverbinden1981_tijd"&gt;''Ik zal u doorverbinden,'' C.J. Wulffraat et al., in ''Honderd jaar telefoon,'' ed. J.H. Schuilenga et al., Staatsbedrijf der Posterijen, Telegrafie en Telefonie, 's-Gravenhage, 1981, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; the number was gradually harmonized nationwide to 002 (or K 02) for all automated exchanges. Even during the Nazi occupation in [[World War II]], the speaking clock was called over two million times a year. During World War II, 12 machines were destroyed and rebuilt after the War by the inventor himself.

In 1969 this system was decommissioned and replaced by a machine that looked like a [[phonograph|record player]] with three pick-up arms. The speaking clock was now much more accurate, telling the time at 10 second intervals followed by a beep, indicating the precise moment. The text was spoken by actress Willie Brill and had the following format: "Bij de volgende toon is het .. uur, .. minuten en .. seconden" (at the following tone, it is .. hour, .. minutes and .. seconds). The service was now called over 130 million times a year.

Finally, in April 1992, all of this machinery was replaced by a digital device with no moving parts. The (digitized) voice was provided by actress Joke Driessen and the clock's accuracy is maintained by linking it to the German longwave radio transmitter [[DCF77]]. To comply with international guidelines limiting double-zero to use as an international prefix, the 002 number was changed on 3 December 1990&lt;ref name="nul19901203"&gt;[http://kranten.delpher.nl/nl/view/index?coll=ddd&amp;image=ddd%3A010963616%3Ampeg21%3Aa0198 06 straks ook voor tijd en weerbericht], Het Vrije Volk, 16 november 1990&lt;/ref&gt; to 06-8002, and later to 0900-8002. Even though many people today have access to accurate time displays from digital wristwatches, mobile phones, and computers, the service still receives approximately four million calls a year, especially around [[New Year's Eve]] and whenever the clocks change in connection with [[daylight saving time]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscom.nl/collecties/telefonischetijdmelders.php Telefonische tijdmelders, ''Museum voor Communicatie'', The Hague, Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

== New Zealand ==
The speaking clock in [[New Zealand]] is run by the [[Time in New Zealand#Standards|Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand]]. The service is reached by dialling 0900 45 678 (calls are 99c per minute). MSL has been running the service since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time and Frequency Standards Services|url=http://www.measurement.govt.nz/services/time-and-frequency|website=Measurement Standards Laboratory of New Zealand|publisher=MSL|accessdate=8 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Norway ==
The speaking clock ({{lang-no|Frøken Ur}}, meaning ''Miss Clock'') in [[Norway]] was in service between 1932 and 15 January 2007 14h00 local time. The service could be reached by dialling 09170 ''(1999&amp;ndash;2007),'' and 170 ''(until 1999).'' Among the women who contributed with their voices for the service were actress Randi Brennes (&amp;ndash;1992) and Kristin Johnson (1992&amp;ndash;2007). When the service ceased it still got about 2000&amp;ndash;3000 calls per month.

== Poland ==
The speaking clock in [[Poland]] is known as ''Zegarynka'' which means ''the clock girl''.
The service became first available in 1936 and it was using a device invented and patented in Poland. It was speaking with the recorded voice of actress [[Lidia Wysocka]]. The first cities to be equipped with this device were [[Katowice]], [[Warszawa]] (dialing number 05&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Spis abonentów warszawskiej sieci telefonów Polskiej Akcyjnej Spółki Telefonicznej i rządowej warszawskiej sieci okręgowej 1938/1939 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1938 |publisher= |location=Warszawa |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=2010-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Gdynia]], [[Toruń]] and [[Kraków]] (July 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kraków między wojnami |last=Brzoza |first=Czesław |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1998 |publisher=Towarzystwo Sympatyków Historii |location=Kraków |isbn=83-909631-0-8 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

For many years the number was 926, but due to the [[European Union|EU]] regulations reserving all 3-digit numbers for emergency services only{{Citation needed|date=May 2017|reason=see [[Talk:Speaking clock#Poland]]}}, it was changed in the early 2000s. The connection is charged on a per-minute basis. In 2009 the number was changed to 19226.

Since 1936, the voiced has been changed twice.

== Russia ==
To hear the current time in [[Russia]] you dial 100 or 060, depending on the city where this service is available. These calls are free if made from non-mobile phones.
In Moscow, the Speaking Clock number is 100 if dialed from within the city, or +7-495-100-xxxx from other countries (where x can be anything).
At one time in Moscow there were advertisements before and after the announcement of the current time; this practice has since ceased.

== South Africa ==
The speaking clock in South Africa is reached by dialling 1026 from fixed or mobile networks and consists of a female voice reading the time in 24-hour format, alternating between [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and English. All of South Africa is in the time zone [[UTC+2]] without any daylight saving time so the speaking clock is the same all over the country.

== Spain ==
In [[Spain]], the speaking clock could be heard by calling 093.

== Sri Lanka ==
[[Sri Lanka Telecom]] provides a Speaking Clock service in three languages.
* 1292 - Sinhala
* 1293 - Tamil
* 1294 - English
More details can be found on SLT telephone directories.

== Sweden ==
The speaking clock ({{lang-sv|Fröken Ur}}, literally ''Miss Clock'') in [[Sweden]] has been in service since 6 October 1934, and can be reached by dialling 90510 (+46 33 90510 or +46 8 90510 from outside Sweden). Four women have contributed with their voices for the service: [[Eva Ulvby]] (1934–1956), [[Berit Hofling]] (1956–1968), [[Ebba Beckman]] (1968–2000), [[Johanna Hermann Lundberg]] (2000-).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sp.se/en/index/services/time_sync/froken_ur |title=SP ensures that Fröken Ur always tells the right time |publisher=Sp.se |date= |accessdate=2013-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:sv:Johanna Hermann Lundberg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Switzerland ==
The speaking clock can be reached under 161 and is bilingual in French and German with the voices alternating between the two languages, the time in German being announced at 0, 20 and 40 seconds and the time in French announced at 10, 30 and 50 seconds past the minute.

== Taiwan ==
In [[Taiwan]], the speaking clock can be reached by [http://www.stdtime.gov.tw/english/index_c/c_1.htm dialing 117.]

== Ukraine ==
To hear the local current time in [[Ukraine]], a person can reach a service of the exact time by [http://www.kyiv.ukrtelecom.ua/reference/newphones dialing 121] from any city in that country.

==Thailand==
In [[Thailand]], the number of the speaking clock is 181.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.navy.mi.th/hydro/time/history.pdf | work=Hydrographic Department, [[Royal Thai Navy]] (HDRTN) | script-title=th:ประวัติการรักษาเวลามาตรฐานประเทศไทย | date= | accessdate=2013-07-31|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the speaking clock can be reached by dialling 123 on a [[BT Group|BT]] phone line; the number may vary on other networks.  
Every ten seconds, a voice announces:

:''"At the third stroke, the time from BT will be (hour) (minute) and (second) seconds"''.  It used to say "sponsored by Accurist" but does not anymore as Accurist withdrew their sponsorship.  The "From BT" part was added, then removed at some point, then reinstated. 

For times that are an exact minute, "precisely" is substituted for the seconds portion of the announcement.  Similarly, announcements for times between the hour and one minute past the hour substitute "o'clock" for the (zero) minutes.  Other operators run their own speaking clocks, with broadly similar formats, or redirect to BT's service.  [[Virgin Media]] have their own service available by dialling 123 from a Virgin Media line.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cableforum.uk/board/showthread.php?t=33654855|title=BT speaking clock is no more on Virgin  Media and T-Mobile! - Cable Forum|website=Cable Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Sky also have their own service accessible from dialling 123 from a Sky telephone line.  

A speaking clock service was first introduced in the [[United Kingdom]] on July 24, 1936. The mechanism used was an array of motors, glass discs, photocells and valves which took up the floorspace of a small room. The voice was that of London telephonist [[Jane Cain|Ethel Jane Cain]], who had won a prize of 10 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] in a competition to find the right voice. Cain's voice was recorded optically onto the glass disks in a similar way to a film soundtrack.&lt;ref name="telephones-uk"&gt;{{cite web | title=Speaking Clock | url=http://www.telephonesuk.co.uk/speaking_clock.htm | website=Telephones UK | first=Mike | last=Fletcher | access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was obtained by dialling the letters TIM (846) on a dial telephone, and hence the service was often colloquially referred to as "Tim". However this code was only used in the telephone systems of the cities of [[London]], [[Birmingham]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]]. Other areas initially dialled 952 but with the introduction of [[subscriber trunk dialling]] it was changed to 80 and later 8081 as more 'recorded services' were introduced and was standardised to 123 by the early 1990s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The time announcements were made by playing short, recorded phrases or words in the correct sequence. In an interview with Manchester Radio in 1957 Miss Cain said:

{{cquote|The way I recorded it was in jerks as it were. I said: "At the Third Stroke" (that does for all the times), and then I counted from One, Two, Three, Four, for the hours, we even went as far as twenty-four, in case the twenty-four-hour clock should need to be used, and then I said "...and ten seconds, and twenty seconds, and thirty, forty, fifty seconds", and "o'clock" and "precisely". The famous "precisely". So what you hear is "At the Third Stroke it will be one, twenty-one and forty seconds".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connected-earth.com/Collections/PeoplesConnectedEarth/Viewcontributions/Recordingthefirstspeakingclock/index.htm Recording the first speaking clock, 1936] Retrieved on 20 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1963, the original device was replaced by more modern recording technology using a magnetic drum. The company that manufactured the rotating magnetic drum part of the Speaking Clock was Roberts &amp; Armstrong (Engineers) Ltd of North Wembley. They took on the licence from the British Post Office to manufacture complete clocks for the telecommunications authorities of Denmark, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland, and a third (spare) clock for the British Post Office. This latter was installed in Bow Street, London. The European clocks were modified for the 24-hour system by lengthening the drum and adding extra heads. Roberts &amp; Armstrong subcontracted the electronic aspects to the Synchronome Company of Westbury. The clocks were designed to run non-stop for 20 years. This system gave way to the present digital system in 1984, which uses a built-in crystal oscillator and microprocessor logic control. The complete apparatus comprises solid-state microchips, occupies no more shelf space than a small suitcase and has no moving parts at all. The BT service is assured to be accurate to five-thousandths of a second.&lt;ref name="telephones-uk" /&gt;

In 1986, BT allowed [[Accurist]] to sponsor its franchise, the first time a sponsor had been used for the service. In the latter years of this sponsorship, it cost 30 [[Penny sterling|pence]] to call the speaking clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/showthread.html?t=100877|title=The Speaking Clock.BT price increase. MoneySavingExpert.com Forums|website=forums.moneysavingexpert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accurist announced its withdrawal from the deal and the launch of an online "British Real Time" website on 24 August 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Guardian | last=Wainwright | first=Martin | url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/aug/25/btgroup | title=Speaking clock sponsor says it's time for change | date=24 August 2008 | access-date=20 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], the [[British Telecom]] speaking clock network was designed to be used in case of nuclear attack to broadcast messages from [[RAF Strike Command|Strike Command]] at [[RAF High Wycombe]] to [[HANDEL]] units at regional police stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ringbell.co.uk/ukwmo/Page211.htm UKWMO early warning system] Retrieved on 20 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; From there, automatic warning sirens could be started and alerts sent to Royal Observer Corps monitoring posts and other civil defence volunteers equipped with manual warning devices. The rationale for using an existing rather than a dedicated system was that it was effectively under test at all times, rather than being activated (and possibly found to be faulty) only in the event of [[war]]. The signals to automatic sirens were sent down the wires of individual (unaware) subscribers for the same reason&amp;nbsp;— a customer would report any fault as soon as it occurred, whereas a problem with a dedicated line would not be noticed until it was needed.

A version of the speaking clock was also used on recordings of proceedings at the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] made by the BBC Parliament Unit, partly as a time reference and partly to prevent editing. On a stereo recording, one track was used for the sound and the other for an endless recording of the speaking clock&amp;nbsp;– without the pips, as these were found to cause interference.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

On the occasion of a [[leap second]], such as at 23:59:60 on December 31, 2005, there is an extra second pause between the second and third beeps thus keeping the speaking clock in sync with [[UTC|Coordinated Universal Time]]. So it will sound like this: “At the third stroke, the time from BT will be, twelve o’clock precisely. Beep, Beep, &lt;pause&gt; Beep.”  The current source of UK time is provided, though not monitored, by the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npl.co.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.1051|title=Page not found : National Physical Laboratory|website=www.npl.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, the British speaking clock has changed voices four times. Almost all changes have occurred on days when the clocks have switched from standard time to [[daylight saving time]] or vice versa. This is due to the fact that 123 is most commonly dialled on these days.

The speaking clock service is not available on the [[Hutchison 3G|3]] and [[Orange (UK)|Orange]] mobile telephone networks, as they use 123 as the number for their voicemail services.

The BT Speaking Clock receives around 70 million calls a year.&lt;ref name="telephones-uk" /&gt;

A separate, non-BT service to access a speaking clock using the voice of [[Pat Simmons (voice actor)|Pat Simmons]], is available at 0871 976 2819. However, the number of calls it can receive at any one time is limited.&lt;ref name=telephones-uk/&gt; Another service, available at 0871 976 2839, announces the time in different voices from the past British, American and Australian services. The service always announces UK time regardless of the voice used.&lt;ref name=telephones-uk/&gt;

=== List of voices heard on the British "BT Speaking Clock" ===
There have been five permanent voices for the speaking clock.  Temporary voices have been used on special occasions, usually with BT donating the call fees collected to charity.

The first automated time service in the United States began in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in 1934 as a promotion for Tick Tock Ginger Ale. Company owner John Franklin modified [[Western Electric]] technology to create the machine that would become known as the [[Audichron]].&lt;ref name="franklin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeonkansas.org/ncentral/chase/0801phone.html|title=EYE on Kansas Online Magazine|website=www.eyeonkansas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Audichron Company]] became the chief supplier of talking clocks in the US, maintained by local businesses and, later, the regional [[Bell System]] companies.

The service became typically known as the "Time of Day" service, with the term "speaking clock" never being used.  Occasionally it would be called "Time and Temperature" or simply "Time".  However, the service had been phased out in most states (Nevada and Connecticut still maintain service). [[AT&amp;T Inc.|AT&amp;T]] discontinued its California service in September 2007, citing the widespread availability of sources such as [[mobile phone]]s and [[computer]]s.&lt;ref name="at&amp;t"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Lazarus |first=David |title=Time of day calling it quits at AT&amp;T |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=August 29, 2007 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/29/business/fi-lazarus29 |accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vague|Many active numbers listed below, maybe this applies only to AT&amp;T?|date=January 2012}}

Many [[shortwave]] [[radio]] [[time signal]] services provide speaking clock services, such as [[WWV (radio station)|WWV]] (voiced by [[John Doyle (announcer)|John Doyle]]) and [[WWVH]] (voiced by [[Jane Barbe]]), operated by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] from the United States of America. To avoid disruption with devices that rely on the accurate timings and placement of the service tones from the radio, the voice recording is "notched" clear of some of the tones.

The time as provided by WWV is also available by telephone, by calling +1&amp;nbsp;303&amp;nbsp;499-7111. WWVH (an auxiliary location in Hawaii) is available at +1&amp;nbsp;808&amp;nbsp;335-4363.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In addition, the [[United States Naval Observatory]] operates two speaking clocks: in [[Washington, D.C.]] at +1&amp;nbsp;202&amp;nbsp;762&amp;nbsp;1401 or +1&amp;nbsp;202&amp;nbsp;762&amp;nbsp;1069, and in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]] at +1&amp;nbsp;719&amp;nbsp;567&amp;nbsp;6742.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Telephone Time|url=http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/time/telephone-time|website=Naval Oceanography Portal|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=31 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These use the voice from Fred Covington (1928–1993) since 1978 and still do today.  

Electronic speaking clocks and [[wristwatch]]es are available, many marketed to the visually impaired.

Many telephone answering machines and similar devices include a speaking clock capability so they can announce the time when a message was received.

In [[linguistics]], the term '''''specialization''''' (as defined by [[Paul Hopper]]), refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalization]] can be detected while it is taking place. The other four principles are: [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]], and [[de-categorialization]].

== Specialization==
Specialization refers to the narrowing of choices that characterizes an emergent [[grammatical construction]]. The [[lexicon|lexical]] meaning of a grammaticalizing feature decreases in scope, so that in time the feature conveys a generalized grammatical meaning.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Within a functional domain, at one stage a variety of forms with different [[semantics|semantic]] nuances may be possible; as grammaticalization takes place, this variety of formal choices narrows and the smaller number of forms selected assume more general grammatical meanings." (Hopper 1991: 22)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A '''tughra''' ({{lang-ota|طغرا}} ''tuğrâ'') is a [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] [[monogram]], [[seal (device)|seal]] or [[signature]] of a sultan that was affixed to all official documents and correspondence. It was also carved on his seal and stamped on the coins minted during his reign. Very elaborate decorated versions were created for important documents that were also works of art in the tradition of [[Ottoman illumination]], such as the example of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] in the gallery below.

The tughra was designed at the beginning of the sultan's reign and drawn by the court [[calligrapher]] or ''[[nisanci|nişancı]]'' on written documents. The first tughra belonged to [[Orhan I]] (1284–1359), the second ruler of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and it evolved until it reached the classical form in the tughra of Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (1494–1566).&lt;ref name=bm&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/tughra_of_suleiman.aspx |title=Tughra of Suleiman the Magnificent |publisher=The British Museum |date=2010-05-14 |accessdate=2010-06-05 |id=1949,0409,0.86 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918022316/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/t/tughra_of_suleiman.aspx |archivedate=2010-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tughras served a purpose similar to the [[cartouche]] in ancient Egypt or the [[Royal Cypher]] of British monarchs. Every Ottoman sultan had his own individual tughra.

==Visual elements of a tughra==
The tughra has a characteristic form, two loops on the left side, three vertical lines in the middle,  stacked writing on the bottom and two extensions to the right. Each of these elements has a specific meaning, and together they make up the form that is easily recognizable as a tughra. [[Image:tugra decomposed.png|thumb|Visual Elements of a Tughra]]

The name of the sultan is written out in the bottom section, called a ''sere''. Depending on the period, this name can be as simple as [[Orhan I|Orhan]], son of [[Osman I|Osman]] in the first tughra in 1326. In later periods honorifics and prayers are also added to the name of the tughra holder and his father.

The loops to the left of the tughra are called ''beyze'', from Arabic meaning ''egg''. Some interpretations of tughra design claim that the beyzes are supposed to symbolize the two seas the sultans held sway over: the outer larger loop signifying the Mediterranean and the inner, smaller loop signifying the Black Sea.

The vertical lines on the top of the tughra are called ''tuğ'', or flagstaff. The three tugs signify independence. The S-shaped lines crossing the tugs are called ''zülfe'' and they, together with the tops of the tugs that also look to the right, signify that the winds blow from the east to the west, the traditional movement of the Ottomans.

The lines to the right of the tughra are called ''hançer'' and signify a sword, symbol of power and might.

== Other tughras ==
Although the tughra is largely identified with the Ottoman Sultans, they have also sometimes been used in other Turkic states, such as the [[Qajar dynasty]], [[Safavid Empire]] and the [[Khanate of Kazan]]. Later, tughras were used among the [[Tatars]] of [[Imperial Russia]].

The [[Mughal Emperor]]s are also known to have used calligraphic symbols, alongside the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the Mughal "Tughra" was circular in shape with three points at its tip, beside the calligraphic signature of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianmuslims.in/quiz-a-mughal-firman/l|title=Quiz: A Mughal firman - Indian Muslims|date=13 June 2011|publisher=|work=indianmuslims.in|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502141629/http://indianmuslims.in/quiz-a-mughal-firman/|archivedate=2016-05-02|first=Kashif|last=ul-huda|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2011}}

==Post-imperial interpretations==

'''Tübatulabal''' {{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|b|ɑː|t|ə|l|ə|b|ɑː|l}} is an extinct [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan language]], traditionally spoken in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. It is the traditional language of the [[Tübatulabal]], who have now shifted to [[English language|English]]. The language originally had three main dialects: Bakalanchi, Pakanapul and Palegawan.

In English, the name Tübatulabal refers to both the Tübatulabal people and their language. However, in the language itself, the term Tübatulabal refers only to the Tübatulabal people. Its origin is unclear, but it may be related to the noun stem ''{{IPA|tɨba-}}'' "pine nuts". The Tübatulabal term for the Tübatulabal language is ''{{IPA|pakaːnil}}.''

==Phonology==
===Segmental phonology===
====Vowels====
There are six phonemic vowels in Tübatulabal:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]
! [[Back vowel|back]]
|-
! [[Close vowel|High]]
| {{IPA|i}}
| {{IPA|ɨ}}
| {{IPA|u}}
|-
! [[Open-mid vowel|Mid]]
| {{IPA|e}}
|
| {{IPA|ɔ}}
|-
! [[Open vowel|Low]]
| colspan="3" | {{IPA|a}}
|}

Contrastive [[vowel length|short and long versions]] of each vowel are found in both stressed and unstressed [[syllable]]s. The vowels have various [[allophone]]s which occur in different environments, most notably more central lax allophones when the vowels are short and occur in unstressed syllables. ''i'' and ''u'' can occur as the second member of a [[diphthong]] with any other vowel, resulting in ten possible diphthongs (Voegelin reports that ''ɨu'' is rare). Phonologically, the members of a diphthong are treated as distinct segments. For example, the common initial reduplication process, which copies the first stem vowel, copies only the first member of a diphthong, e.g.:

''{{IPA|ʔuinul}}'' 'the sucker fish'

''{{IPA|ʔuʔuinul}}'' 'the many suckers in one place'

Vowel length is contrastive. However, according to {{Harv | Jensen | 1973}}, in the suffixing morphology length is typically predictable. In most cases, the first suffix is short, the second suffix is long, the third suffix is short, and so on. For example, the verbal stem ''{{IPA|tɨk-}}'' 'to eat' can be expanded to ''{{IPA|tɨk-ilɔːɡ-ɔ-maːla}}'' 'let us go and pretend to eat'. In this word, each suffix alternates in length compared to its neighbors. When arranged differently, the same suffixes will have different lengths. Thus compare ''{{IPA|maːla}}'' 'let us' with the realization of the same morpheme in ''{{IPA|tɨk-al-aː-mala}}'' 'let us go eat'.

Tübatulabal consonants show a basic voicing distinction, with a corresponding alternately voiced phoneme present for almost every obstruent. Unlike English, Tübatulabal voiceless consonants are not aspirated.

Non-contrastive allophones of all vowels occur, usually when a vowel follows a nasal consonant, and especially when it also precedes a glottal consonant.

All consonants except the glottal stop can occur as [[gemination|geminates]]. Gemination is often phonologically predictable.&lt;ref&gt;See Jensen for discussion of the role of "2.6 Gemination" in Tubatulabal phonology. (1973:61 ''et seq'')&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, all consonants except the voiced stops and the glottal stop geminate when following a short vowel. All stops and affricates are geminated in word-final position, regardless of the length of the preceding vowel.

===Prosody===
Tübatulabal has predictable word stress, which is tied to morphological constituency and syllable weight. Primary stress falls on the final syllable of the stem. Secondary stress is assigned right to left from the final syllable, falling on every other [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]:

''{{IPA|ˌʔɨmbɨŋˌwibaˈʔat}}'' "he is wanting to roll string on his thigh" &lt;ref&gt;See Jensen for discussion of the arbitrary behavior of glottal stops in stress assignment. The glottal stop, which is not otherwise counted as a mora, is counted as a mora for the purpose of stress assignment. {{Harv | Jensen | 1973:76–76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{IPA|ˌjuːuˌduːˌjuːuˈdat}}'' "the fruit is mashing"

Words with the form VːCVCV will be stressed as ˌVːCVˈCV:

''{{IPA|ˌnaːwiˈʃul}}'' "the pine-nut pole"

For the purposes of stress assignment, two identical short vowels that are separated only by a glottal stop are treated as a single vowel if and only if they belong to the same morpheme:

''{{IPA|ˌkuʔud͡ʒuˈbil}}'' "the little one"

==Morphology==

There are three basic word types in Tübatulabal: verbs, nouns, and particles. Verbs may be formed from verbal stems or from noun stems with verbalizing morphology; similarly, nouns can be formed from noun stems or from verbal stems with nominalizing morphology. Particles have their own stems, but they have comparatively little inflection, whereas both verbs and nouns tend to be very morphologically complex.

There are four word-formation processes in Tübatulabal: suffixation, [[reduplication]], conjunction and compounding.

===Suffixation===

Suffixation is the most common and productive process in [[agglutinative]] word-formation. Suffixes form a closed class and occur in a fixed order according to the word type.

===Reduplication===

There are two kinds of reduplication: full reduplication and partial reduplication. Full reduplication is the less common type and marks the iterative aspect in verbs.

Partial reduplication can occur as initial or final reduplication. Final reduplication is very rare and always expresses the idea of plural allegiance. It is also apparently limited to occurring with noun stems or suffixes that end in ''{{IPA|wa}}''. Voegelin illustrates with an example:

''{{IPA|tɔhat͡siŋwan}}'' 'his hunting partner'

''{{IPA|tɔhat͡siŋwawaːn}}'' 'his hunting partner (in the sense that the partner referred to, being very proficient, has many companions in hunting)'

Initial reduplication is far more productive. It is used to express collective plurality in nouns
and to express aspect reversal in verbs. Initial reduplication prefixes a copy of the first vowel of the stem (as well as any immediately following nasal), preceded by a fixed ''{{IPA|ʔ}}''. The underlying stem-initial consonant (if any) may also undergo changes, particularly in voicing and length. Some examples illustrate the reduplication process:

{| class=wikitable
!Base form|| Reduplicated form|| Base form gloss
|-
|{{IPA|tɨk}}-||{{IPA|ʔɨtːɨk}}||to eat
|-
|{{IPA|tana}}-||{{IPA|ʔandana}}||to get down
|-
|{{IPA|paːabɨ}}-||{{IPA|ʔaːbaːabi}}||to be tired
|-
|{{IPA|kulaːabiʃt}}||{{IPA|ʔukːulaːabiʃt}}||the duck
|}

===Conjunction===
Conjunction involves the combination of a particle with a word of another type. According to Voegelin, the behavior of particles is similar to that of [[clitic|enclitics]] in other Uto-Aztecan languages but distinct enough from them that it should not be considered to be a kind of cliticization.

===Compounding===

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compounding]] appears to have been a much more productive process at an earlier stage of the language. It now has very limited productivity, and in many cases, it appears to have been completely lexicalized if it occurs.

===Verb morphology===

Each verb stem has an unpredictable inherent aspect value (either [[telicity|telic]] or [[telicity|atelic]]; by default, a bare stem is inherently atelic), and an inherent value for transitivity (transitive, intransitive or impersonal). The inherent values can be changed by morphological addition to yield a verb stem with any of the other possible values. Aspect reversal is indicated by initial reduplication. Transitivity change is indicated by the use of one (or more) of a number of derivational suffixes with which verbs are constructed.

The full verb structure can be summarized as (A) + B + (C) + (D), where B is the verb root, and the other positions (all optional) represent classes of morphemes. A&amp;nbsp;indicates initial reduplication, which can occur only once per word. C indicates a class of derivational morphemes, which can be divided into ten ordered positions, each of which allows at most one morpheme per word. D is the final position; there are nine possible morphemes in final position, but only one can occur in any single word.

The C class morphemes are given with examples in the table below. When these morphemes co-occur in a word, they must occur in the order given. Transitivity changing morphemes are marked with *. They have a different effect depending on the inherent transitivity of the verb root, as well as the presence of other transitivity-changing morphology.

{| class=wikitable
!Suffix|| Gloss|| Example word|| Gloss
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)n}}||causative *||{{IPA|hɔːhinat}}||'s/he is coughing (through the agency of a crumb)'
|-
|{{IPA|-(a)n}}||benefactive *||{{IPA|weleʔanat kɔːimi}}||'s/he is crawling to the woman (perhaps in the sense of "he is crawling there for the erotic benefit of the woman")'
|-
|{{IPA|-(a)la}}/-{{IPA|(a)ɡiːm}}/-{{IPA|(a)kin}}/{{IPA|-(a)min}}||movement||{{IPA|ʔɨtːɨkːamin}}||'s/he ate it here and went away'
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)niːnɨm}}||distributive||{{IPA|ʔawaʃiniːnɨm}}||'s/he dug first here, then there'
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)lɔːk}}||pretending to||{{IPA|ʔanaŋaːlilɔːɡibaʔat}}||'s/he wants to go along pretending he is crying'
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)baʔ}}||desiderative||{{IPA|ʔamaɡiːibaʔ}}||'s/he is on the verge of learning about it'
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)ʃa}}||future||{{IPA|ʔapaʔaniʃa}}||'it will get plugged up'
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)w}}||passive *||{{IPA|weːhiwat}}||'s/he is being licked (e.g. kitten by mother cat)'
|-
|{{IPA|-(i)wɨːt}}||collective-intensive||{{IPA|ʔapahkaniwɨːdiʃa}}||'they will speak Tübatulabal'
|-
|{{IPA|-(a)puw-}}||similative||{{IPA|wɨʃɨpuwat}}||'it seems to be ripening'
|}

The possible verbal final morphemes (class D) are shown below. Unlike the class C morphemes, only one of these final-position morphemes can occur in any single word. Therefore, the ordering of morphemes in this table does not indicate anything about a linear relationship among the morphemes.

|}

===Noun morphology===

All nouns (whether derived from verb stems or noun stems) are obligatorily marked as absolute or relative. Nouns must also be marked with one of the three basic [[grammatical case|cases]]: subject, object, or genitive. Relative nouns make a finer distinction between [[suus genitive|suus]] and [[ejus genitive|ejus]] objects and genitives. In addition to this obligatory morphology, nouns may also receive suffixes indicating several secondary cases ([[inessive]], [[ablative]], [[allative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]]) as well as many other derivational suffixes.

Nouns may be divided into three basic classes according to their stem shape and morphological behavior and sometimes according to their semantic contribution as well. The basic test for classification is how the noun occurs when it is absolute. The absolute suffix has a different [[allomorph]] when it occurs with a noun from each of these classes. Class A nouns all have vowel-final stems, and add the absolute suffix as -''l''. Class B noun stems may be vowel-final or consonant-final, but in either case the absolute suffix is -''t''. Class C is a small class of nouns, many of which are kinship terms or other [[inalienable noun]]s. The absolute noun is phonologically null when it occurs with class C nouns.&lt;ref&gt;The morphological differences between noun classes can probably be traced back to a simple case of allomorphy. At a certain point in the history of an ancestor of Tübatulabal, all class A nouns ended in a vowel, while all class B nouns ended in a consonant. (Class C forms are few in number and have a more complicated origin.) The absolute suffix in this language was *-''t'', which lenited intervocalically, leading to -''l'' in Tübatulabal class A nouns (compare cognates {{IPA|ʈ͡ʂ}} in [[Serrano language|Serrano]], {{IPA|r}} in [[Tongva language|Tongva]].) See {{Harv | Voegelin | 1935}} and {{Harv | Manaster Ramer | 1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the classes can be subdivided into two or more classes, depending on phonological differences in the noun stem that lead to divergent behavior in certain case forms. Specifically, class A is divided into A1 nouns (stems end with a long vowel) and A2 nouns (stems end with a short vowel). Class B is divided into five subclasses, depending on whether the stem ends in a short vowel, a long vowel, ''n'', ''m'', or a voiceless consonant. Class C is divided into C1 (nouns which take an overt relative suffix) and C2 (nouns with no overt relative suffix).

The following table illustrates each of the noun classes and subclasses, with all obligatory cases:

{| class=wikitable
!Class

Forms in this table are those for a third-person singular possessor -''n''. The exception is ''suus'' forms, which do not allow a possessive suffix (since they are inherently possessed by/related to the grammatical subject of the clause).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Particle morphology===

Morphemes belonging to the particle class are distinguished by the fact that they undergo little or no inflection and suffixation, unlike verbs and nouns. The particle class includes two subclasses of morphemes which behave quite differently: conjunctive particles and independent particles.

Conjunctive particles resemble clitics in that they never appear independently but always lean on another word. However, unlike clitics, conjunctive particles typically bear their own stress, and they do not alter the stress of the word on which they lean. Conjunctive particles include various discourse and modal morphemes as well as the typical pronominal agreement morphemes that occur with verbs.

Independent particles are fully independent words. They include prepositional, modal and exclamatory morphemes, numerals, and one class of pronouns.

The table below shows the pronominal morphemes of Tübatulabal. Like nouns, pronouns distinguish between three cases: subject, object and possessive. (Pronouns do not make a distinction between absolute and relative entities.) Different forms exist for first-, second- and third-person entities. Second- and third-person forms distinguish only singular and plural numbers, but first-person forms distinguish between singular, dual inclusive, dual exclusive, and plural numbers. All pronouns may be expressed bu conjunctive particles. The subject pronouns are unique in that they can also be expressed by an independent particle.&lt;ref&gt;Cells marked with ''--'' are phonologically null. Cells marked with ''?'' are forms missing without explanation in {{Harv | Voegelin | 1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|3sg. || in || (-d͡za) || || – || || -n
|-
|3pl. || inda || -da || || -tɨpɨ || || -p
|}

The first-person subject conjunctive forms have special allomorphs when they occur with the exhortative suffix -''ma'':

{| class="wikitable IPA"
|1sg.   || --
|-
|1d.inc.||-la
|-
|1d.inc.||-laʔaŋ
|-
|1pl.   ||-luːt͡s
|}

The third-person conjunctive form is usually null, but it is expressed by -''d͡za'' after the exhortative or permissive suffixes. (The suffix often undergoes syncope and devoicing, yielding -''t͡s''.) The second-person conjunctive plural subject form may also syncopate, and medial vowel then shortens as well: -''bum''. The first-person conjunctive singular subject form may also syncopate, triggering devoicing but no irregular phonology: the suffix then has the form -''k''.

Subject pronouns typically lean on verbs (if conjunctive) and correspond to grammatical subject: ''iwikkːɨki'' "I discarded (it)" (with devoicing); ''anabaːhaʃta'' "they can throw it" (with metathesis of the components of the affricate and a change of ''s'' &gt; ''ʃ'').

Object pronouns also lean on verbs and indicate any non-possessive oblique function, including transitive objects, ditransitive objects or benefactives, objects of imperative verbs, and subjects of subordinate verbs if not equivalent to the subject of the [[clause#Dependent and independent clauses|matrix verb]].

Possessive pronouns typically lean on the [[possessum]]: ''{{IPA|haniːnɨʔɨŋ}}'' "my house"; ''{{IPA|ʃɔːɔjin}}'' "his wife".

==Syntax==

[[Word order]] is generally flexible. According to {{Harv | Voegelin | 1935}}, "Word-order in general is stylistic rather than obligatory." (p.&amp;nbsp;185)

==Orthography==

Transcriptions in this article follow the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). Much published material concerning Tübatulabal uses the [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] orthography. In addition, the most important linguistic work on Tübatulabal, the original grammatical description of the language, {{Harv | Voegelin | 1935}} uses a somewhat different orthography.

[[Charles F. Voegelin|Voegelin]] writes ''{{IPA|ɨ}}'' as ''ï'' and ''{{IPA|ɔ}}'' as ''ô''. He also writes ''{{IPA|ʃ}}'' as ''c'', ''{{IPA|t͡ʃ}}'' as ''tc'', ''{{IPA|ʔ}}'' as ''‘'', ''{{IPA|d͡ʒ}}'' as ''dž'' and ''{{IPA|j}}'' as ''y''. He also uses a number of special symbols for vocalic allomorphs. ''ι'' is an allomorph of ''i'', ''μ'' is an allomorph of ''u'', ''o'' is an allomorph of ''ô'' (IPA ''{{IPA|ɔ}}''), and ''ŏ'' is an allomorph of both ''a'' and ''ô''.

The letter ''ü'' in the name Tübatulabal represents the central unrounded vowel ''{{IPA|ɨ}}''.

'''''Vita Merlini''''', or '''''The Life of Merlin''''', is a work by the Norman-Welsh author [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], composed in [[Latin]] around 1150. It retells incidents from the life of the [[Brython]]ic seer [[Merlin]], and is based on traditional material about him.

Merlin is described as a prophet in the text. There are a number of episodes in which he loses his mind and lives in the wilderness like a wild animal, like [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] in the [[Book of Daniel]], or the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[wild man]] of the woods. It is also the first work to describe the Arthurian sorceress [[Morgan le Fay]], as ''Morgen''.

Geoffrey had written of Merlin in his two previous works, the ''[[Prophetiae Merlini]]'', purporting to be a series of prophecies from the sage, and the ''[[The History of the Kings of Britain|Historia Regum Britanniae]]'', which is the first work presenting a link between Merlin and [[King Arthur]]. The ''Vita Merlini'' presents an account of Merlin much more faithful to the Welsh traditions about [[Myrddin Wyllt]], the archetype behind Geoffrey's composite figure of Merlin. Whereas the ''Historia'' had Merlin associating with Arthur, his father [[Uther Pendragon]], and his uncle [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Ambrosius]] in the 5th century, the ''Vita'''s timeframe is during the late 6th century, and includes references to various figures from that period, including [[Gwenddoleu ap Ceidio|Gwenddoleu]] and [[Taliesin]]. Geoffrey attempts to synchronize the ''Vita'' with his earlier work by having Merlin mention he had been with Arthur long before.
