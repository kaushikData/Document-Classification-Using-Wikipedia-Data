The '''Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development''' (until 2015: Digital Development) was established in May 2010 as a joint initiative by the [[International Telecommunication Union]] (ITU) and the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO) to promote [[Internet access]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about.html |title = About| publisher = Broadband Commission |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713135408/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about.html |archivedate=July 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular, [[broadband networks]] in order to help achieve United Nations development goals, such as the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (until 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission was renamed the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, following the adoption of the UN's [[Sustainable Development Goals]] in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadbandcommission.org/about/Pages/default.aspx |title=Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development - About |publisher=broadbandcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Structure==
The commission is jointly chaired by H.E. [[Paul Kagame]] President of [[Rwanda]] and [[America Movil]] owner [[Carlos Slim]], and jointly vice-chaired by the heads to the two founding UN agencies, the Secretary-General of the [[International Telecommunication Union]] [[Houlin Zhao]], and [[UNESCO]] Director-General [[Audrey Azoulay]].

Members of the commission include, policy-makers and government representatives, international agencies, academia and organizations concerned with development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadbandcommission.org/commissioners.html Commissioners] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514094219/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/commissioners.html |date=May 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to its chairs and vice-chairs,  51 commissioners included [[Jeff Sachs]], [[Muhammad Yunus]], [[Hans Vestberg]], [[Mo Ibrahim]] and [[Martin Sorrell]].

==Advocacy ==
The Broadband Commission engages in high-level advocacy to promote broadband in developing countries and underserved communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/engagement.aspx |title=Engagement |publisher=Broadbandcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001937/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/engagement.aspx |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the Commission's stated goals is to advocate that broadband infrastructure be given the highest priority level in future development policy and city planning frameworks. 

To date, the Commission's output has included several major reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/work/documents.aspx |title=Reports and Documents |publisher=Broadbandcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117133125/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/work/documents.aspx |archivedate=2014-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including “A 2010 Leadership Imperative: The Future Built on Broadband” presented to then United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] in September 2010, before the 2010 United Nations [[Millennium Development Goals|MDGs]] Summit in New York. The document constitutes a concise, high-level report that directly reflects inputs from the Commission's community of high-level business executives and policy-makers and contains a number of policy recommendations and "Declaration of Broadband Inclusion for All".

=== Targets ===
{{Main|Broadband Commission Targets}}
As part of its advocacy work, in 2011 the commission established a framework of four "ambitious but achievable" targets that countries should strive to meet by 2015 in order to help achieve the MDGs through digital development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/Pages/previous-targets.aspx|title=about|website=www.broadbandcommission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# by 2015, all countries should have a [[National broadband plan|National Broadband Plan]] or strategy or include broadband in their Universal Access and Service Definition
# by 2015, entry-level broadband services should be made affordable in developing countries
# by 2015, 40% of households in developing countries should have Internet access
# by 2015, Internet user penetration should reach 60% worldwide, 50% in developing countries and 15% in [[Least Developed Countries]]
# Achieving gender equality in access to broadband by 2020

With the fifth target being added in 2013, designed to spur female access to the power of information and communication technologies (ICTs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/Pages/previous-targets.aspx|title=about|website=www.broadbandcommission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the commission launched a framework of now seven "ambitious but achievable" targets, that countries should strive to meet by the year 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/Pages/default.aspx|title=Home|website=www.broadbandcommission.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025, all countries should have a funded national broadband plan or strategy, or include broadband in their universal access and services definition.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025, entry-level broadband services should be made affordable in developing countries, at less than 2% of monthly [[gross national income]] [[per capita]].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025 broadband-Internet user penetration should reach:
    &lt;ol type="a"&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;75% worldwide&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;65% in developing countries&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;35% in least developed countries&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025, 60% of youth and adults should have achieved at least a minimum level of proficiency in sustainable digital skills.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025, 40% of the world's population should be using digital financial services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025, un-connectedness of Micro-, Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises should be reduced by 50%, by sector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;By 2025, gender equality should be achieved across all targets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;The Broadband Commission targets were developed at ITU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/conferences/e-week2018/Pages/MeetingDetails.aspx?meetingid=1824|title=unctad.org {{!}} e-week 2018 {{!}}|website=unctad.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and launched at the [[World Economic Forum]] 2018 in [[Davos]].

== Evaluation==
Since 2012 the Commission has published an annual State of Broadband report, positioned as a snapshot of the global broadband industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/work/documents.aspx |title=Reports and Documents |publisher=Broadbandcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117133125/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/work/documents.aspx |archivedate=2014-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports are issued every year during a high-level meeting on the side of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York, and are specifically targeted at government policy-makers, as well as those engaged with setting the UN's Post 2015 development agenda. Each report includes a country ranking based on key indicators for Internet-user penetration and Internet access affordability.
  
In addition to its annual reports, the Broadband Commission employs working groups to address specific action items or focus areas. Working groups examine such issues as Science, Health, Climate Change, Youth, Education, Gender and Finance and Investment; and reflect the wide-ranging impact of broadband technologies across multiple sectors. Past outputs from working groups include reports, consultations and workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/work/working-groups/default.aspx |title=Working Groups |publisher=Broadbandcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203045526/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/work/working-groups/default.aspx |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-2015==
During the countdown to 2015 and the due date for the [[Millennium Development Goals|MDGs]], the Commission's advocacy and policy outreach has increasingly been directed towards actors responsible for setting the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]], to recognize the importance of ICT/broadband infrastructure, networks, applications and services for sustainable economic, social and environmental development. In April 2013 the, group issued an Open Letter to United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's Panel of Eminent Persons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2013/12.aspx |title=Broadband Commission Open Letter to UNSG’s Panel of Eminent Persons |publisher=Itu.int |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a broadband manifesto&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itu.int/net/pressoffice/press_releases/2013/67.aspx |title=Broadband Manifesto champions transformative power of high-speed networks to drive socio-economic development |publisher=Itu.int |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in September at the 69th session of the General Assembly.

==Donors==
Donors include [[Grupo Carso]], [[Digicel Group]], [[Bharti Enterprises]], [[Intel]], [[Ooredoo]], [[Ericsson]], [[Cisco]] and the [[Mo Ibrahim Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/donors.aspx |title=Donors |publisher=Broadbandcommission.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140406000115/http://www.broadbandcommission.org/about/donors.aspx |archivedate=2014-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

In September 2015, the Broadband Commission released a report on "cyber violence" against women, which addressed online harassment targeted at women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.unwomen.org/~/media/headquarters/attachments/sections/library/publications/2015/cyber_violence_gender%20report.pdf?v=1&amp;d=20150924T154259|title = Cyber Violence Against Women and Girls|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report has been criticised by some for being anti free speech and advocating internet censorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Few Comments on the UN Broadband Commission's "Cyber Violence Against Women And Girls" Report|url = https://popehat.com/2015/09/24/a-few-comments-on-the-un-broadband-commissions-cyber-violence-against-women-and-girls-report/|website = Popehat|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UN Broadband Commission Releases Questionable Report On 'Cyber Violence' Against Women {{!}} Techdirt|url = https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150927/13460532378/un-broadband-commission-releases-questionable-report-cyber-violence-against-women.shtml|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have criticised the report for providing questionable information that has been poorly cited, which included non-existent sources and a source linking to a file on the author's computer hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Citation Games By the United Nations’ #CyberViolence|url = https://medium.com/@KingFrostFive/citation-games-by-the-united-nations-cyberviolence-e8bb1336c8d1|website = Medium|accessdate = 2015-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founder and president of LawProse Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawprose.org/bryan-garner/|title=Who is Bryan Garner|website=LawProse.org|accessdate=2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; he serves as Distinguished Research Professor of Law at Southern Methodist University [[Dedman School of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.law.smu.edu/professor-profiles/garner|title=Bryan A. Garner|last=|first=|date=|website=SMU Dedman School of Law|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Garner was born in [[Lubbock, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Lubbock-Texas.html|title= Lubbock, Texas|publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate= May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in [[Canyon, Texas]]. He attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he published excerpts from his senior thesis, notably "Shakespeare's Latinate Neologisms"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|date=1982|title=Shakespeare's Latinate Neologisms|journal=Shakespeare Studies|volume=15|pages=149–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Latin-Saxon Hybrids in Shakespeare and the Bible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|date=June 1983|title=Latin-Saxon Hybrids in Shakespeare and the Bible|journal=Studies in the Humanities|volume=10|pages=39–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Velz, ''Looking Back at Some Turns in the Road'', in Burnt Orange Britannia (Wm. Roger Louis ed., 2005), at 390, 400.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="courtly"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stowers|first1=Carlton|title=Courtly Language|work=Dallas Observer|date=19–25 July 2001|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kruh"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kruh|first1=Nancy|title=Bryan Garner: The Lawyer and Lexicographer Is a Man of His Words|work=Dallas Morning News|date=9 May 1999|pages=E1, 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kix"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Kix |first=Paul |date= November 2007|title=The English Teacher |magazine=D Magazine|pages=41–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Dave|title=On a Language Quest|journal=Dallas Business Journal|date=5–11 October 2007|pages=37, 42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving his B.A. degree, Garner entered the [[University of Texas School of Law]], where he served as an associate editor of the ''[[Texas Law Review]]''.

==Career==
After receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree in 1984, he clerked for [[Thomas M. Reavley|Judge Thomas M. Reavley]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] before he joined the Dallas firm of Carrington, Coleman, Sloman &amp; Blumenthal. He then returned to the University of Texas School of Law and was named director of the Texas/Oxford Center for Legal Lexicography.

In 1990, he left the university to found LawProse Inc., which provides seminars on clear writing, briefing and editing for lawyers and judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lawprose.org/consulting/|title=Consulting|website=LawProse.org|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner has taught at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California at Berkeley (Boalt Hall)]], [[Texas Tech University School of Law]], and [[Texas A&amp;M University School of Law]]. He has been awarded three honorary doctorates ([[Stetson University College of Law|Stetson]], [[University of La Verne College of Law|La Verne]], and [[Western Michigan University Cooley Law School|Thomas M. Cooley Law School]]). He serves on the Board of Advisers of [[The Green Bag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://greenbag.org/green_bag_edsandads.html |title=Green Bag editors and advisers |website=The Green Bag |access-date=2018-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
As a student at the University of Texas School of Law in 1981, Garner began noticing odd usages in lawbooks, many of them dating back to [[Shakespeare]]. They became the source material for his first book, ''A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage'' (1987).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|last=Garner|first=Bryan A.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1987|isbn=0195043774|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1990, his work has focused on teaching the legal profession clear writing techniques.

In books, articles,&lt;ref name="footnoted"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=Footnoted Citations Can Make Memos and Briefs Easier to Comprehend|journal=Student Lawyer|date=September 2003|pages=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="winning"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=The Winning Brief|date=2004|pages=139–158|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="plain"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=Legal Writing in Plain English|date=2001|pages=77–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage|date=1995|page=156|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elements"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garner|first1=Bryan A.|title=The Elements of Legal Style|date=2002|pages=91–92|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lectures, Garner has tried to reform the way bibliographic references are "[[wikt:interlard|interlarded]]" (interwoven) in the midst of textual analysis. He argues for putting [[legal citation|citations]] in [[footnote]]s and notes that in-text information that is important but non-bibliographic. He opposes references such as "457 U.S. 423, 432, 102 S.Ct. 2515, 2521, 89 L.Ed.2d 744, 747" as interruptions in the middle of a line. However, such interruptions in judges' opinions and in lawyers' briefs have remained the norm. Some courts and advocates around the country have begun adopting Garner's recommended style of footnoted citations, and a surprising degree of internal strife has resulted within some organizations. For example, one appellate judge in Louisiana refused to join in a colleague's opinions written in the new format.&lt;ref name="William Glaberson 2001, pp. 1, 16"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Glaberson|first1=William|title=Legal Citations1 on Trial in Innovation v. Tradition|work=The New York Times|date=8 July 2001|pages=1, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garner says that one of the main reasons for the reform is to make legal writing more comprehensible to readers who lack a legal education. That has attracted opposition, most notably from Judge [[Richard A. Posner]] of the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Posner, [http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf "Against Footnotes"], 38 Court Rev. 24 (Summer 2001) (answering Garner, [http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Garner.pdf "Clearing the Cobwebs from Judicial Opinions"], 38 Court Rev. 4 (Summer 2001)).&lt;/ref&gt; and from his co-author, Justice [[Antonin Scalia]].&lt;ref name="making"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scalia|first1=Antonin|last2=Garner|first2=Bryan A.|title=Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges|date=2008|publisher=West|pages=132–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1992, Garner has contributed numerous revisions to the field of procedural rules, when he began revising all amendments to the sets of Federal Rules ([[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|Civil]], [[Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure|Appellate]], [[Federal Rules of Evidence|Evidence]], [[Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure|Bankruptcy]], and [[Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure|Criminal]]) for the [[Judicial Conference of the United States]].

Garner and Justice Scalia wrote ''Making Your Case: The Art of Persuading Judges'' (2008). Garner maintains a legal consulting practice, focusing on issues in statutory construction and contractual interpretation.

===English grammar and usage===
Garner's books on English usage include ''[[Garner's Modern English Usage]]''. In 2003, he contributed a chapter on grammar and usage to the 15th edition of the ''[[Chicago Manual of Style]]'', and later editions have retained it.

=== Black's Law Dictionary ===
In 1995, Garner became the editor in chief of ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]''.  He created a panel of international legal experts to improve the specialized vocabulary in the book. Garner and the panel rewrote and expanded the dictionary's lexicographic information.

'''Conférence Internationale Permanente d'Instituts Universitaires de Traducteurs et Interprètes''' (French for ''International Standing Conference of University Institutes of Translators and Interpreters''), abbreviated as '''CIUTI''', is an international academy associating [[translation]] and [[Literary theory|interpretation]] institutes affiliated to universities. Founded in the 1960s, the institution aims at promoting international T&amp;I cooperation in both professional training and academic research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ciuti.org/ | title=CIUTI | accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of CIUTI was proposed by the universities of [[Geneva University|Geneva]], [[Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], [[University of Mainz|Mainz/Germersheim]], [[University of Paris|Paris-Sorbonne]], [[Saarland University|Saarbrücken]] and [[University of Trieste|Trieste]], in response to the high demand for competent translators and interpreters after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ciuti.org/about-us/history/ | title=History | accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIUTI membership is open to institutions at the level of tertiary education only, and restricted to those who offer programs in translation, interpreting and multilingual communication. A set of high quality standards is attached to membership applications, which involves strict requirements on curriculum structure, research, academic infrastructure and resources of applicant institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ciuti.org/join-ciuti/admission-procedure/ | title=Admission procedure | accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''California Department of Education''' is an agency within the [[Government of California]] that oversees [[Public school (government funded)|public education]]. Its headquarters are located in the U.S. state of California's capital city, [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cde.ca.gov/index.asp Home]." California Department of Education. Retrieved on December 21, 2011. "California Department of Education 1430 N Street Sacramento, CA 95814"&lt;/ref&gt;

The department oversees funding and testing, and holds local educational agencies accountable for student achievement. Its stated mission is to provide leadership, assistance, oversight, and resources (via teaching and teaching material) so that every Californian has access to a good education.

The [[California State Board of Education|State Board of Education]] is the governing and policy-making body, and the [[California State Superintendent of Public Instruction|State Superintendent of Public Instruction]] is the nonpartisan (originally partisan) elected executive officer. Superintendents serve four-year terms. The current Superintendent of Public Instruction is [[Tom Torlakson]].  The Superintendent serves as the state's chief spokesperson for public schools, and provides education policy and direction to local school districts. He also serves as an [[ex officio]] member of governing boards of the state's higher education system.

==History==

In 1920, the [[California State Legislature]]'s Special Legislative Committee on Education conducted a comprehensive investigation of California's educational system.  The Committee's final report, drafted by [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]], explained that the system's chaotic ''ad hoc'' development had resulted in the division of jurisdiction over education at the state level between 23 separate boards and commissions, with a total of about 160 members.  The report recommended the consolidation and centralization of all these entities under the jurisdiction of a single California Department of Education, and also to clarify the exact relationship between the existing State Board of Education and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction.  Therefore, on May 31, 1921, the legislature enacted a bill creating such a department, to be headed by a Director of Education, and which also concurrently made the State Superintendent of Public Instruction the ''ex officio'' director of the new department.

Among the various entities thus integrated were the State Normal Schools, which lost their boards of trustees, were made subordinate to the department's deputy director for the Division of Normal and Special Schools, and were renamed State Teachers Colleges. This created a rather bizarre administrative situation from 1921 to 1960.  On the one hand, the department's actual supervision of the presidents of the State Teachers Colleges was rather minimal, which translated into substantial autonomy when it came to day-to-day operations.&lt;ref name="Gerth6"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerth|first1=Donald R.|title=The People's University: A History of the California State University|date=2010|publisher=Berkeley Public Policy Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780877724353|page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the State Teachers Colleges were treated under state law as ordinary state agencies, which meant their budgets were subject to the same stifling bureaucratic financial controls as all other state agencies (except the University of California).&lt;ref name="Gerth6" /&gt;   At least one president would depart his state college because of his express frustration over that issue (J. Paul Leonard, president of San Francisco State, in 1957).&lt;ref name="Gerth6" /&gt; The State Teachers Colleges were renamed State Colleges in 1935, but retained the same legal status. They finally regained full administrative autonomy after the recommendations of the [[California Master Plan for Higher Education]] were signed into law as the Donahoe Higher Education Act of 1960, which created the California State Colleges (now the [[California State University]]) and authorized the appointment of a board of trustees and systemwide chancellor who would be independent of the department.  In 1967, the state's junior colleges (which had largely developed as extensions of existing high school districts at the local level) were renamed community colleges and organized into the [[California Community College System]], and that system was in turn authorized to have its own board of governors and systemwide chancellor who would also be independent of the department.  

Since then, the department has been focused on regulating and supporting local school districts which directly provide the bulk of [[K-12]] primary and secondary education throughout the state, as well as operating the state's three special schools and three diagnostic centers in support of [[special education]].

'''Charles Maurice Lisner''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (1928 - 1988) was the founder and first artistic director of the [[Queensland Ballet]]. Born in [[Paris]], [[France]], Lisner emigrated to [[Australia]] with his parents in 1937.  He started dancing late in life, in his early twenties, and traveled to London where he spent time with the [[Sadler's Wells Ballet]]. He later joined the [[Royal Ballet]], [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]].

In 1953, Lisner returned to [[Queensland]] after the death of his father, and established the Lisner Ballet Academy with virtually no money. From that academy grew Lisner's privately owned company, the Lisner Ballet, which was established in 1960.  In 1962, the name was changed to the [[Queensland Ballet]].  Lisner stepped down as Artistic Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company in 1974.

Lisner married Valerie, one of his dancers. He was an uncredited dancer [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1101913/] in ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948) [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725/]

Queensland Ballet studio seasons are performed in ''The Charles Lisner Studio Theatre'' of the ''[[Thomas Hill Dixon|Thomas Dixon]] Centre''

He was appointed OBE in the [[1976 New Year Honours]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7687">The '''College English Test''' ({{zh|first=s|s=大学四六级英语考试／大学公共英语考试}}), better known as '''CET''', is a national [[English as a foreign or second language|English as a foreign language]] test in the [[China|People's Republic of China]].  It examines the English proficiency of undergraduate and postgraduate students in China. It is meant to ensure that Chinese undergraduates and postgraduates reach the required English levels specified in the National College English Teaching Syllabuses (NCETS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Syllabus for College English Test|year=2006|publisher=Shanghai Language Education Press|location=Shanghai, China}}&lt;/ref&gt; This test has existed in China for 26 years and now 18 million people take it annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hunan.voc.com.cn/xhn/article/201611/201611190837005318001.html 英语考试又要改革，四六级还有用吗？详细解答] Retrieved 2016-12-03&lt;/ref&gt; It includes two levels — CET4 (非专业四级) and CET6 (非专业六级).

Another kind of national English as a foreign language test is '''Test for English Majors''' (Chinese: 高校英语专业考试), better known as '''TEM'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edu.qianlong.com/2016/1117/1123688.shtml 现有的英语能力考试，你知道都是咋回事吗？] Retrieved 2016-12-03&lt;/ref&gt; It includes two levels — TEM4 (英语专业四级) and TEM8 (英语专业八级).

==College English Test==
Generally, College English Test allows all non-English-major university students to attend.

===Before 2005 reform===
Before the 2005 reform, the maximum score was 100 points. A test score higher than 85 is graded as "Excellent", and a test score higher than 60 but below 85 is graded as "Pass" in the certificate. This test was held nationally twice a year in summer and winter. The CET consisted of the non-English-specialized "Band 4" (CET4), in which certificate-holders have reached the English level of non-English major undergraduate students, and "Band 6" (CET6), in which the certificate-holders have reached the English level of non-English major postgraduates. The test included listening, reading and writing sections. The spoken test was optional.

===2005 reform===
[[File:CET-6 Score Report.jpg|thumb|250px|CET-6 Score Report for non-English-Major students]]
The CET was reformed in 2005. Several changes were made, including:

*Re-ordered and re-organized sections; more listening and spoken sections; new "Skimming &amp; Scanning" and "Translation" sections;
*New grading system: scores are graded on a curved scale, so that the highest score possible is 710, while the lowest mark is a score of 290(finish all questions but all wrong);
*Passing grades and qualification certificate elimination; 
*A more detailed score report on each section;
*Public service elimination: only university students need to take the test.

The CET-4 is mandatory for university students in China who are not English majors. It is also a prerequisite for a [[bachelor's degree]]. Many [[Economy of China|employers in China]] prefer applicants with CET-4 or even CET-6 certification.

Passing the CET is important for Chinese college students. Graduates may only be able to get a degree or a good job if they can pass the CET with a high score.

While the CET tests reading, writing and listening, it does have a separate test for speaking. The speaking test is held twice a year and only students with a CET Band-4 score higher than 550 or a CET Band-6 higher than 485 are eligible for the test.

==Test for English Majors==

A similar but more rigorous test, the Test for English Majors (TEM), is mandatory for English majors, and it is generally only for English majors. For these students, passing the TEM-4 is a graduation requirement. The test should be taken by the end of the second academic or sophomore year. TEM-8 ("Band 8") is the highest level for English major students; it should be taken during the end of the last academic or senior year.

If an English-major student fails to pass the TEM-4 during his or her sophomore year, they may attempt to pass the TEM-8 during their senior year. Those failing the TEM-8 are only allowed one re-test (during the following year after they have graduated from college).  A second failure results in disqualification lifelong.

Both TEM4 and TEM8 are only two qualifications for any students lifelong.

==Vocabulary Requirements==
=== CET series ===
*CET-4: 4500 words
*CET-6: 6500 words

=== TEM series ===
*TEM-4: 8000 words
*TEM-8: 13000 words

==Social consequences==
Some Chinese researchers point out the positive social consequences of the CET as it has promoted the role of English teaching and learning at the tertiary level in China over its 20-year history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gu|first=X|title=Positive or negative? An empirical study of CET washback on college English teaching and learning in China.|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=J|title=The current College English Test in China: Problems and thoughts|journal=Language Education|year=2002|volume=23|pages=33–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Han,Yang|first=Dai, L|title=Problems with College English Test as|journal=Foreign Languages and Their Teaching|year=2004|volume=179|pages=17–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  challenge the CET by pointing out that the test does not assess communicative competence as the teaching syllabus requires. Before the recent reform of the CET, the large proportion of multiple choice questions made this test an efficient one, but possible sacrifices in accurately measuring English language ability remained a concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=X|title=On the negative impact of College English Test Band 4|journal=Educational Science|year=2003|volume=19|pages=35–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the CET certificates had been one of the graduation requirements of undergraduates in the majority of Chinese universities for almost 20 years, test-oriented teaching was another severe problem. However, there have been changes made in the CET test content, format, and scoring systems are evidence of the endeavors to bring about positive [[washback effect|washback]] of the test on English teaching and learning in China. It is the expectation of the CET committee that the test can reflect and catch up with the needs of rapid economic reform and the new open-door policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jin|first=Y|title=On the improvement of test validity and test washback: The CET|journal=Foreign Language World|year=2006|volume=6|pages=65–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exam score distributions==
Answering all questions incorrectly will result in 330, the lowest score a test taker can get in CET4. By contrast, receiving a score higher than 600 is usually regarded as "perfect" and that means the test taker has not only answered most multiple choice questions correctly but received a positive feedback on his performance in the writing section.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cet.edu.cn/cet2011.htm 大学英语四、六级考试分数解释] Retrieved 2017-8-23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|Busing||Busing (disambiguation)}}
'''Desegregation busing''' in the United States (also known as '''forced busing''' or simply '''busing'''{{cn|date=February 2018}}) is the practice of assigning and [[student transport|transporting students to schools]] so as to redress prior [[racial segregation]] of schools, or to overcome the effects of residential segregation on local school demographics.

In 1954, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] landmark decision in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' declared racial segregation in [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]] unconstitutional. The process of integrating public schools met fierce resistance in the South where segregation laws took hold after the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction Era of the United States]]. In Northern and Western states, ''de facto'' segregation was the customary practice. Due to patterns of residential segregation, a principal tool for racial integration was the use of busing.&lt;ref name="Jost 345–372"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=Kenneth|title=School Desegregation|journal=CQ Researcher|date=April 23, 2004|volume=14|issue=15|pages=345–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1971 ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal courts had the discretion to include busing as a desegregation tool to achieve racial balance. While the ''Swann'' decision addressed ''de jure'' segregation in the South, it failed to address ''de facto'' segregation which persisted elsewhere in the country. In Georgia, Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] saw that ''Swann'' was "clearly a one-sided decision; the Court is still talking about the South, the North is still going free".&lt;ref name=patterson/&gt; In the 1974 ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' decision, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] placed an important limitation on ''Swann'' when they ruled that students could be bused across district lines only when evidence of ''de jure'' segregation across multiple school districts existed.

In the 1970s and 1980s, under federal court supervision, many school districts implemented mandatory busing plans within their district. A few of these plans are still in use today. An example of stiff resistance to desegregation busing was the [[Restore Our Alienated Rights]] movement in [[Boston]].

Since the 1980s, desegregation busing has been in decline. Even though school districts provided [[zero-fare]] [[bus]] transportation to and from students' assigned schools, those schools were in some cases many miles away from students' homes, which often presented problems to them and their families. In addition, many families were angry about having to send their children miles to another school in an unfamiliar neighborhood when there was an available school a short distance away. The movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called [[white flight]], reduced the effectiveness of the policy.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York,  New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages= 252–264|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many whites who stayed moved their children into [[private school|private]] or [[parochial schools]]; these effects combined to make many urban school districts predominantly nonwhite, reducing any effectiveness mandatory busing may have had.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; In addition, school districts started using [[magnet school]]s, new school construction, and more detailed computer-generated information to refine their school assignment plans.

==History==

===Before World War II===
{{further|Black school}}

Prior to [[World War&amp;nbsp; II]], most public schools in the country were ''de jure'' or ''de facto'' segregated. All [[ Southern United States|Southern states]] had [[Jim Crow Laws|Jim Crow laws]] mandating racial segregation of schools. Northern states and some border states were primarily white (as of 1940, populations of Detroit and Chicago were more than 90% white) and, furthermore, existing black populations were concentrated in urban ghettos partly as the result of restrictive covenants.

===After World War II===
The origins of desegregation busing can be traced back to two major developments that occurred in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s.

====Black population shift====
Starting in 1940, the [[Second Great Migration (African American)|Second Great Migration]] brought five million blacks from the agrarian South to the urban and manufacturing centers in Northern and Western cities to fill in the labor shortages during the industrial buildup of [[World War II]] and for better opportunities during the post-war economic boom. ''[[Shelley v. Kraemer]]'' (1948) allowed them to settle in formerly white neighborhoods, contributing to racial tension. Meanwhile, the post-war housing boom and the rise of [[suburbia]] allowed whites to migrate into the suburbs. By 1960, all major Northern and Western cities had sizable black populations (e.g., 23% in Chicago, 29% in Detroit, and 32% in Los Angeles). Blacks tended to be concentrated in [[inner cities]], whereas newer suburbs of most cities were almost exclusively white.

====Legal rulings====

At the same time, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Brown vs Board of Education]]'' (1954) overturned [[racial segregation]] laws for public schools that had been in place in a number of states since the late 19th century, and ruled that [[separate but equal]] schools were "inherently unequal". Although the ''Brown'' decision affirmed principles of equality and justice, it did not specify how its ruling would promote equality in education. [[Thurgood Marshall]] and the [[NAACP]] wanted a speedy process for desegregating the school districts, but the Court waited until the following year to make its recommendations. Reasons for delaying had to do with the changes in the Court and with Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] steering a careful course given the expected opposition from Southern states.  In May 1955, the Court ruled in ''[[Brown&amp;nbsp; II]]'' that the school districts desegregate "with all deliberate speed". Public school administrators had to begin the process of desegregating the schools through the development of policies that would promote racial mixing.  A backlash of resistance and violence ensued.  Even members of Congress refused to abide by the decision.  In 1956 over a hundred congressmen signed the [[Southern Manifesto]], promising to use all legal means to undermine and reverse the Court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Journal|last=Jost|first=K|title=School Desegregation|journal=CQ Researcher|date=April 23, 2004|volume=14|issue=15|pages=345–372.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The momentum continued with two additional Supreme Court decisions aimed at implementation.  In 1968, the Warren Court in ''[[Green v. County School Board of New Kent County]]'', rejected a freedom of choice plan.  The Court ordered the county to desegregate immediately and eliminate racial discrimination "root and branch".&lt;ref name=patterson/&gt; Then in 1971, the [[Burger Court]] in ''[[Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' ruled that the school district must achieve racial balance even if it meant redrawing school boundaries and the use of busing as a legal tool.  The impact of ''Green'' and ''Swann'' served to end all remnants of ''de jure'' segregation in the South. However, the consequence of the ''Swann'' decision ushered in new forms of resistance in subsequent decades.  The decision failed to address ''de facto'' segregation.

Consequently, despite being found "inherently unequal" in ''Brown v. Board of Education'', by the late 1960s public schools remained ''de facto'' segregated in many cities because of demographic patterns, school district lines being intentionally drawn to segregate the schools racially, and, in some cases, due to conscious efforts to send black children to inferior schools.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan v. Hennigan 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, for example, by 1969, more than nine of every ten black students in [[Nashville]] still attended all-black schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernspaces.org/2009/walking-history-beginning-school-desegregation-nashville|title=Walking into History: The Beginning of School Desegregation in Nashville}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of such de facto segregation motivated early proponents of plans to engage in conscious "integration" of public schools, by busing schoolchildren to schools other than their neighborhood schools, with an objective to equalize racial imbalances. Proponents of such plans argued that with the schools integrated, minority students would have equal access to equipment, facilities, and resources that the cities' white students had, thus giving all students in the city equal educational opportunities.

A federal court found that in [[Boston]], schools were constructed and school district lines drawn intentionally to segregate the schools racially. In the early 1970s, a series of court decisions found that the racially imbalanced schools trampled the rights of minority students. As a remedy, courts ordered the [[racial integration]] of school districts within individual cities, sometimes requiring the racial composition of each individual school in the district to reflect the composition of the district as a whole. This was generally achieved by transporting children by [[school bus]] to a school in a different area of the district.

The judge who instituted the Detroit busing plan said that busing "is a considerably safer, more reliable, healthful and efficient means of getting children to school than either carpools or walking, and this is especially true for younger children".&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; He, therefore, included [[kindergarten]] children in the busing scheme: "Transportation of kindergarten children for upwards of forty-five minutes, one-way, does not appear unreasonable, harmful, or unsafe in any way."&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; The resultant Supreme Court case, ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'', imposed limits on busing.  The key issue was whether a district court could order a metropolitan-wide desegregation plan between urban Detroit and suburban school districts.  Busing would play a key role in the implementation phase. The Court essentially declared that federal courts did not have the authority to order inter-district desegregation unless it could be proven that suburban school districts intentionally mandated segregation policies.  The implication of the decision was that suburban school districts in the North were not affected by the principles established by ''Brown''. ''De facto'' segregation was allowed to persist in the North. The courts could order desegregation where segregation patterns existed, but only within municipalities, not suburban areas.  The lasting consequence of the ''Milliken'' decision is that it opened the door for whites to flee to the suburbs and not be concerned about compliance with mandatory integration policies.&lt;ref name=patterson/&gt;

With waning public support, the courts began relaxing judicial supervision of school districts during the 1990s and 2000s, calling for voluntary efforts to achieve racial balance. In the early 1990s, the [[Rehnquist Court]] ruled in three cases coming from [[Oklahoma City]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], and [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]] in Georgia that federal judges could ease their supervision of school districts "once legally enforced segregation had been eliminated to the extent practicable".&lt;ref name=jost&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=K.|title=School Desegregation|journal=CQ Researcher|date=April 23, 2004|volume=14|issue=15|pages=345–372}}&lt;/ref&gt; With these decisions, the Rehnquist Court opened the door for school districts throughout the country to get away from under judicial supervision once they had achieved unitary status.  [[Unitary Status]] meant that a school district had successfully eliminated segregation in dual school systems and thus was no longer bound to court-ordered desegregation policies.

Then in 2002, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision in ''[[Belk v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education]]'' which declared that the school system had achieved desegregation status and that the method to achieve integration, like busing, was unnecessary. The refusal of the Court to hear the challenges to the lower court decision effectively overturned the earlier 1971 ''Swann'' ruling.

Finally, in 2007, the [[Roberts Court]] produced a contentious 5–4 ruling in ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No.&amp;nbsp;1]]'' (PICS). The decision prohibited the use of racial classifications in student assignment plans to maintain racial balance. Whereas the Brown case ruled that racial segregation violated the Constitution, now the use of racial classifications violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. However, Justice Kennedy's concurrence did hold that “avoiding racial isolation” and addressing “the problem of de facto resegregation in schooling” remain compelling state interests which can be addressed by narrowly tailored programs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/29/washington/29scotus.html|title=Justices Limit the Use of Race in School Plans for Integration|journal=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for the minority, Justice Breyer said the "ruling contradicted previous decisions upholding race-conscious pupil assignments and would hamper local school boards' efforts to prevent 'resegregation' in individual schools".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=Kenneth|title=Racial Diversity in Public Schools|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2007|volume=17|issue=32|pages=745–767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights movement===

The struggle to desegregate the schools received impetus from the [[Civil Rights Movement]], whose goal was to dismantle legal segregation in all public places. The movement's efforts culminated in Congress passing the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]. Signed by President [[Lyndon Johnson]], the two laws signaled the end of discriminatory voting practices and segregation of public accommodations.  The importance of these two laws was the injection of both the [[legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] branches joining the judiciary to promote racial integration.  In addition, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 authorized the federal government to cut off funding if Southern school districts did not comply and also to bring lawsuits against school officials who resisted.&lt;ref name=patterson&gt;{{cite book|last=Patterson|first=James|title=''Brown v. Board of Education'': A Civil Rights Milestone and Its Troubled Legacy (Pivotal Moments in American History)|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=USA|isbn=0-19-515632-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument against the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that opponents of the proposed legislation found particularly compelling was that the bill would require forced busing to achieve certain [[racial quotas]] in schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Proponents of the bill, such as [[Emanuel Celler]] and [[Jacob Javits]], said that the bill would not authorize such measures. Leading sponsor Sen. [[Hubert Humphrey]] wrote two amendments specifically designed to outlaw busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Humphrey said "if the bill were to compel it, it would be a violation [of the Constitution], because it would be handling the matter on the basis of race and we would be transporting children because of race".&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; While Javits said any government official who sought to use the bill for busing purposes "would be making a fool of himself", two years later the [[Department of Health, Education and Welfare]] said that Southern school districts would be required to meet mathematical ratios of students by busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

===Sociological study===
Another catalyst for the development of busing was an influential [[sociological]] report on educational equality commissioned by the U.S. government in the 1960s. It was one of the largest studies in history, with more than 150,000 students in the sample. The result was a massive report of over 700 pages. That 1966 report—titled "Equality of Educational Opportunity" (or often simply called the "Coleman Report" after its author [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]])—contained many controversial findings.&lt;ref name="Kiviat"&gt;Kiviat, Barbara J. (2000) "[http://www.jhu.edu/~jhumag/0400web/18.html The Social Side of Schooling]", ''Johns Hopkins Magazine'', April 2000, accessed 30 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanushek"&gt;Hanushek, Eric A. (1998), "[http://newyorkfed.org/research/epr/98v04n1/9803hanu.pdf Conclusions and Controversies about the Effectiveness of School Resources]", ''Economic Policy Review'', Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 4(1): pp. 11-27, accessed 30 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; One conclusion from the study was that, while black schools in the South were not significantly underfunded as compared to white schools, and while per-pupil funding did not contribute significantly to differences in educational outcomes, socially disadvantaged black children still benefited significantly from learning in mixed-race classrooms. Thus, it was argued that busing (as opposed to simply increasing funding to segregated schools) was necessary for achieving racial equality.

===Reaction===
====Before 2007====
The impact of the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' ruling was limited because whites and blacks tended to live in all-white or all-black communities. Initial integration in the South tended to be symbolic: for example, the integration of [[Clinton High School (Clinton, Tennessee)|Clinton High School]], the first public school in Tennessee to be integrated, amounted to the admission of twelve black students to a formerly all-white school.

"Forced busing" was a term used by many to describe the mandates that generally came from the courts. Court-ordered busing to achieve school desegregation was used mainly in large, ethnically segregated school systems, including [[Boston]], Massachusetts; [[Cleveland]] and [[Columbus, Ohio]]; [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[San Francisco]], California; [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia; [[Detroit]], Michigan; and [[Wilmington, Delaware]]. From 1972 to 1980, despite busing, the percentage of blacks attending mostly-black schools barely changed, moving from 63.6 percent to 63.3 percent.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

In some southern states in the 1960s and 1970s, parents opposed to busing created new private schools. The schools, called [[segregation academies]], were sometimes organized with the support of the local [[White Citizen's Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = The Citizen's Council: Organized Resistance to the Second Reconstruction, 1954–1964| page = 301 | last = McMillen | first = Neil R. | publisher = [[University of Illinois Press]] | year = 1971 | place = Urbana | isbn = 0-252-00177-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1975–76 school year, the [[Louisville, Kentucky]] school district, which was not integrated due to whites largely moving to the suburbs, was forced to start a busing program.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; The first day, 1,000 protestors rallied against the busing, and a few days into the process, 8,000 to 10,000 whites from [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]], [[Kentucky]], many teenagers, rallied at the district's high schools and fought with police trying to break up the crowds.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Police cars were vandalized, 200 were arrested, and people were hurt in the melee, but despite further rallies being banned the next day by Louisville's mayor, demonstrators showed up to the schools the following day.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Kentucky Governor [[Julian Carroll]] sent 1,800 members of the [[Kentucky National Guard]] and stationed them on every bus.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; On September 26, 1975, 400 protestors held a rally at [[Southern High School (Kentucky)|Southern High School]], which was broken up by police [[tear gas]], followed by a rally of 8,000 the next day, who marched led by a woman in a [[wheelchair]] to prevent police reprisals while cameras were running.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Despite the protests, Louisville's busing program continued.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

====After 2007====
Civil rights advocates see the 2007 ruling of the Roberts court as the inevitable consequence of gradual court decisions dating back to the early 1970s to ease judicial supervision and limit important tools to achieve integrated schools. Even those school districts that voluntarily created race-conscious programs are under pressure to abandon these efforts as the white parents are refusing to participate in any pupil assignment programs. In some cases, white parents filed [[reverse discrimination]] lawsuits in court.  Wherever the courts have backed away from mandating school districts to implement desegregation plans, resegregation of Blacks and Latinos has increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Orfield, G. |author2=Lee, C. |last-author-amp=yes |title=Historic reversals, accelerating resegregation, and the need for new integration strategies|year=2007|publisher=Los Angeles: The Civil Rights Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, 44 percent of southern black students were attending majority-white schools.  In 2005, 27 percent of black students were attending majority white schools. By restricting the tools by which schools can address school segregation, many fear that the PICS decision will continue to accelerate this trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brennancenter.org/legal-work/parents-involved-community-schools-v-seattle-school-district-no-1|title=Brennan Center for Justice}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling reflects the culmination of the conservatives' central message on education that "race should be ignored, inequalities should be blamed on individuals and schools, and existing civil rights remedies should be dismantled".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orfield|first=G|title=Reviving the goal of an integrated society: A 21st century challenge|year=2009|publisher=Los Angeles: The Civil Rights Project|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 Congress passed the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] (NCLB) which was promptly signed by President [[George W. Bush]]. The law put a premium on student testing, not integration, to measure academic progress.  Financial penalties were incurred on schools if students did not demonstrate adequate academic performance. While initially supported by Democrats, critics say, the law has failed to adequately address the achievement gap between whites and minorities and that there are problems with implementation and inflexible provisions.&lt;ref name="Jost 345–372"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In a [[Gallup poll]] taken in the early 1970s, very low percentages of whites (4 percent) and blacks (9 percent) supported busing outside of local neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; A 1978 study by the [[RAND Corporation]] set out to find why whites were opposed to busing and concluded that it was not because they held [[racism|racist]] attitudes, but because they believed it destroyed neighborhood schools and camaraderie and increased discipline problems.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; It is said that busing eroded the community pride and support that neighborhoods had for their local schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; After busing, 60 percent of Boston parents, both black and white, reported more discipline problems in schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; In the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]], and [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976]] presidential elections, candidates opposed to busing were elected each time, and Congress voted repeatedly to end court-mandated busing.&lt;ref name="'70s 265"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 265|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics point out that children in the Northeast were often bused from integrated schools to less integrated schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; The percentage of Northeastern black children who attended a predominantly black school increased from 67 percent in 1968 to 80 percent in 1980 (a higher percentage than in 1954).&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

Busing is claimed to have accelerated a trend of middle-class relocation to the suburbs of metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Many opponents of busing claimed the existence of "[[white flight]]" based on the court decisions to integrate schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Such stresses led white middle-class families in many communities to desert the public schools and create a network of private schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

Ultimately, many black leaders, from [[Wisconsin]] State Rep. [[Annette Polly Williams]], a Milwaukee Democrat, to [[Cleveland]] Mayor [[Michael R. White]], have come to the conclusion that it is patronizing to think that minority students need to sit next to a white student to learn, and as such led efforts to end busing.&lt;ref name="QuickFacts"&gt;"[http://www.adversity.net/education_2_north_carolina.htm]", ''Adversity.net.'' Retrieved on June 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, a proponent of busing, Nancy St. John, studied 100 cases of urban busing from the North and did not find what she had been looking for;&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; she found no cases in which significant black academic improvement occurred, but many cases where race relations suffered due to busing, as those in forced-integrated schools had worse relations with those of the opposite race than those in non-integrated schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt; Researcher David Armour, also looking for hopeful signs, found that busing "heightens racial identity" and "reduces opportunities for actual contact between the races".&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;
A 1992 study led by [[Harvard University]] Professor [[Gary Orfield]], who supports busing, found black and Hispanic students lacked "even modest overall improvement" as a result of court-ordered busing.&lt;ref name="Status of School Desegregation"&gt;{{cite book |title= Status of School Desegregation: The Next Generation|last= Orfield|first= Gary|authorlink= David Frum|author2=Franklin Monfort|year= 1992|publisher= National School Boards Association|location= Alexandria, VA|isbn= 0-88364-174-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another mystery was why Asian students, segregated in some school systems, nevertheless thrived academically.&lt;ref name=lazerson&gt;Michael R. Olneck and Marvin Lazerson, "Education" pp. 313, 317, in "Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups", ed. Stephan Thernstrom, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reported that some members of Congress, government, and the press who supported busing most vociferously sent their own children to private schools, including Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]], [[George McGovern]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Phil Hart]], [[Ben Bradlee]], Senator [[Birch Bayh]], [[Tom Wicker]], [[Philip Geyelin]], and [[Donald M. Fraser|Donald Fraser]].&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;  Many of the judges who ordered busing also sent their children to private schools.&lt;ref name="'70s 252"/&gt;

==Effects==
Busing integrated school age ethnic minorities with the larger community.{{Clarify|reason=Integrated how, and with what larger community?|date=August 2017}}  The ''[[Milliken v. Bradley]]'' Supreme Court decision that busing children across districts is unconstitutional limited the extent of busing to within metropolitan areas.  This decision made suburbs attractive to those who wished to evade busing.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Some metropolitan areas in which land values and property-tax structures were less favorable to relocation saw significant declines in enrollment of whites in public schools as white parents chose to enroll their children in private schools. Currently, most segregation occurs across school districts as large cities have moved significantly toward racial balance among their schools.&lt;ref&gt;Rivkin, Steven G., and Finis Welch. 2006.

Recent research by [[Eric Hanushek]], John Kain, and Steven Rivkin has shown that the level of achievement by black students is adversely affected by higher concentrations of black students in their schools.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Hanushek|Eric A.

==Historical examples==

===Boston, Massachusetts===
{{Main article|Boston busing crisis}}
In 1965 Massachusetts passed into law the Racial Imbalance Act, which ordered school districts to desegregate or risk losing state educational funding. The first law of its kind in the nation, it was opposed by many in Boston, especially less-well-off white ethnic areas, such as the Irish-American neighborhoods of [[South Boston]] &amp; [[Charlestown, Boston]].&lt;ref name = "NYT-Fox-2012-01-29"&gt;

===Springfield, Massachusetts===
Unlike Boston, which experienced a large degree of racial violence following Judge [[Arthur Garrity]]'s decision to desegregate the city's public schools in 1974, Springfield quietly enacted its own desegregation busing plans. Although not as well-documented as Boston's crisis, Springfield's situation centered on the city's elementary schools. Much of the primary evidence for Springfield's busing plans stemmed from a March 1976 report by a committee for the Massachusetts Commission on Civil Rights (MCCR). According to the report, 30 of the city's 36 elementary schools were grouped into six separate districts during the 1974–75 school year, and each district contained at least one racially imbalanced school. The basic idea behind the "six-district" plan was to preserve a neighborhood feeling for school children while busing them locally to improve not only racial imbalances, but also educational opportunities in the school system.&lt;ref name=mccr&gt;Massachusetts Commission on Civil Rights, "[http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/usccr/documents/cr1259.pdf The Six-District Plan: Integration of the Springfield, Mass., Elementary Schools]", ''University of Maryland Law School Library'', pp.1-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, a federal court took partial control of the [[Kansas City, Missouri School District]] (KCMSD). Since the district and the state had been found [[severally liable]] for the lack of integration, the state was responsible for making sure that money was available for the program. It was one of the most expensive desegregation efforts attempted and included busing, a magnet school program, and an extensive plan to improve the quality of [[inner city]] schools. The entire program was built on the premise that extremely good schools in the inner-city area combined with paid busing would be enough to achieve integration.

===Las Vegas, Nevada===
In May 1968, the [[Southern Nevada]] chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) filed a lawsuit against the [[Clark County School District]] (CCSD). The NAACP wanted the CCSD to acknowledge publicly, and likewise, act against the ''de facto'' segregation that existed in six elementary schools located on the city's Westside.&lt;ref name=ronan&gt;Matthew, Ronan, ''A History of the Las Vegas School Desegregation Case: Kelly et al. v. Clark County School District'' (Las Vegas: UNLV, 1998), pp. 28, 33, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; This area of Las Vegas had traditionally been a [[black neighborhood]]. Therefore, the CCSD did not see the need to desegregate the schools, as the cause of segregation appeared to result from factors outside of its immediate control.

The case initially entered the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada, but quickly found its way to the [[Nevada Supreme Court]]. According to [[Brown&amp;nbsp;II]], all school desegregation cases had to be heard at the federal level if they reached a state's highest court. As a result, the Las Vegas case, which became known as ''Kelly v. Clark County School District'', was eventually heard by the U.S. [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. On May 10, 1972, the Ninth Circuit handed down its decision in favor of the NAACP, which therefore required the CCSD to implement a plan for integration. The CCSD then instituted its ''Sixth Grade Center Plan'', which converted the Westside's six elementary schools into sixth-grade classrooms where nearly all of the school district's sixth graders (black and white alike) would be bused for the 1972–73 school year.&lt;ref name=ronan/&gt;

===Los Angeles, California===
In 1963, a lawsuit, ''Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles'',&lt;ref&gt;Crawford v. Board of Ed. of Los Angeles {{ussc|458|527|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; was filed to end segregation in the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]].  The [[California Supreme Court]] required the district to come up with a plan in 1977.  The board returned to court with what the court of appeal years later would describe as "one of if not the most drastic plan of mandatory student reassignment in the nation".&lt;ref&gt;''Crawford v. Board of Educ. of the City of Los Angeles'', 200 Cal. App. 3d 1397, 1402 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  A desegregation busing plan was developed, to be implemented in the 1978 school year.  Two suits to stop the enforced busing plan, both titled ''Bustop, Inc. v. Los Angeles Board of Education'', were filed by the group Bustop Inc., and were petitioned to the [[United States Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;''Bustop, Inc. v. Los Angeles Bd. of Ed.'', {{ussc|439|1380|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The petitions to stop the busing plan were subsequently denied by [[Justice Rehnquist]] and [[Justice Powell]].  California Constitutional Proposition&amp;nbsp;1, which mandated that busing follow the [[Equal protection clause]] of the U.S. Constitution, passed in 1979 with 70 percent of the vote.  The ''Crawford v. Board of Education of the City of Los Angeles'' lawsuit was heard in the Supreme Court in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Ettinger, "[http://www.lacba.org/Files/LAL/Vol26No1/1302.pdf The Quest to DESEGREGATE Los Angeles Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228005530/http://www.lacba.org/Files/LAL/Vol26No1/1302.pdf |date=2008-02-28 }}", ''Los Angeles Lawyer'', March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  The Supreme Court upheld the decision that Proposition&amp;nbsp;1 was constitutional, and that, therefore, mandatory busing was not permissible.

===Nashville, Tennessee===
In comparison with many other cities in the nation, [[Nashville]] was not a hotbed of racial violence or massive protest during the civil rights era. In fact, the city was a leader of school desegregation in the South, even housing a few small schools that were minimally integrated before the ''Brown v. Board of Education'' decision in 1954. Despite this initial breakthrough, however, full desegregation of the schools was a far cry from reality in Nashville in the mid-1950s, and thus 22 plaintiffs, including black student Robert Kelley, filed suit against the Nashville Board of Education in 1955.

The result of that lawsuit was what came to be known as the [["Nashville Plan"]], an attempt to integrate the public schools of Nashville (and later all of [[Davidson County, Tennessee|Davidson County]] when the district was consolidated in 1963). The plan, beginning in 1957, involved the gradual integration of schools by working up through the grades each year starting in the fall of 1957 with first graders. Very few black children who had been zoned for white schools showed up at their assigned campus on the first day of school, and those who did met with angry mobs outside several city elementary schools. No white children assigned to black schools showed up to their assigned campuses.

After a decade of this gradual integration strategy, it became evident that the schools still lacked full integration. Many argued that [[Housing Segregation]] was the true culprit in the matter. In 1970 the ''Kelley'' case was reintroduced to the courts. Ruling on the case was Judge [[Leland Clure Morton]], who, after seeking advice from consultants from the [[United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], decided the following year that to correct the problem, forced busing of the children was to be mandated, among the many parts to a new plan that was finally decided on. This was a similar plan to that enacted in [[Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], the same year.

What followed were mixed emotions from both the black and white communities. Many whites did not want their children to share schools with black children, arguing that it would decrease the quality of their education. While a triumph for some, many blacks believed that the new plan would enforce the closure of neighborhood schools such as Pearl High School, which brought the community together. Parents from both sides did not like the plan because they had no control over where their children were going to be sent to school, a problem that many other cities had during the 1970s when busing was mandated across the country. Despite the judge's decision and the subsequent implementation of the new busing plan, the city stood divided.

As in many other cities across the country at this time, many white citizens took action against the desegregation laws. Organized protests against the busing plan began before the order was even official, led by future mayoral candidate Casey Jenkins. While some protested, many other white parents began pulling their children out of the public schools and enrolling them in the numerous private schools that began to spring up almost overnight in Nashville in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of these schools continued to be segregated through the 1970s. Other white parents moved outside of the city limits and eventually outside the Davidson County line so as not to be part of the Metropolitan District and thus not part of the busing plan.

In 1979 and 1980, the ''Kelley'' case was again brought back to the courts because of the busing plan's failure to fully integrate the [[Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools]] (MNPS). The plan was reexamined and reconfigured to include some concessions made by the school board and the Kelley plaintiffs and in 1983 the new plan, which still included busing, was introduced. However, problems with "[[white flight]]" and private schools continued to segregate MNPS to a certain degree, a problem that has never fully been solved.&lt;ref&gt;Richard A. Pride and J. David Woodard, ''The Burden of Busing: The Politics of Desegregation in Nashville, Tennessee'', University of Tennessee Press, Knoxville: 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pasadena, California===
In 1970 a [[United States district court|federal court]] ordered the desegregation of the public schools in [[Pasadena, California]]. At that time, the proportion of white students in those schools reflected the proportion of whites in the community, 54 percent and 53 percent, respectively. After the desegregation process began, large numbers of whites in the upper and middle classes who could afford it pulled their children from the integrated public school system and placed them into private schools instead. As a result, by 2004 Pasadena became home to 63 private schools, which educated one-third of all school-aged children in the city, and the proportion of white students in the public schools had fallen to 16 percent. In the meantime, the proportion of whites in the community has declined somewhat as well, to 37 percent in 2006. The superintendent of Pasadena's public schools characterized them as being to whites "like the bogey-man", and mounted policy changes, including a curtailment of busing, and a publicity drive to induce affluent whites to put their children back into public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penfamilies.org/www/pen/Files/LA%20Daily%20Journal%20Article%20on%20Pasadena%20School%20Reform.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616180135/http://www.penfamilies.org/www/pen/Files/LA%20Daily%20Journal%20Article%20on%20Pasadena%20School%20Reform.doc |archivedate=2007-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prince George's County, Maryland===
{{unreferenced section |date=October 2014}}
In 1974, [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]], Maryland, became the largest school district in the United States forced to adopt a busing plan. The county, a large suburban school district east of [[Washington, D.C.]], was over 80 percent white in population and in the public schools. In some county communities close to Washington, there was a higher concentration of black residents than in more outlying areas. Through a series of desegregation orders after the ''Brown'' decision, the county had a neighborhood-based system of school boundaries. However, the [[NAACP]] argued that housing patterns in the county still reflected the vestiges of segregation. Against the will of the Board of Education of Prince George's County, the federal court ordered that a school busing plan be set in place. A 1974 [[Gallup poll]] showed that 75 percent of county residents were against forced busing and that only 32 percent of blacks supported it.

The transition was very traumatic as the court ordered that the plan be administered with "all due haste". This happened during the middle of the school term, and students even in their senior year in high school were transferred to different schools to achieve racial balance. Many high school sports teams' seasons and other typical school activities were disrupted. Life in general for families in the county was disrupted by things such as the changes in daily times to get children ready and receive them after school, transportation logistics for extracurricular activities, and parental participation activities such as volunteer work in the schools and [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meetings.

The federal case and the school busing order was officially ended in 2001, as the "remaining vestiges of segregation" had been erased to the court's satisfaction. Neighborhood-based school boundaries were restored. The Prince George's County Public Schools was ordered to pay the [[NAACP]] more than $2 million in closing attorney fees and is estimated to have paid the NAACP over $20 million over the course of the case.

===Richmond, Virginia===
In April 1971, in the case ''Bradley v. Richmond School Board'', Federal District Judge [[Robert R. Merhige,&amp;nbsp;Jr.]], ordered an extensive citywide busing program in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], Virginia. When the massive busing program began in the fall of 1971, parents of all races complained about the long rides, hardships with transportation for extracurricular activities, and the separation of siblings when elementary schools at opposite sides of the city were "paired", (i.e., splitting lower and upper elementary grades into separate schools). The result was further white flight to private schools and to suburbs in the neighboring counties of [[Henrico County, Virginia|Henrico]] and [[Chesterfield County, Virginia|Chesterfield]] that were predominately white. In January 1972, Merhige ruled that students in Henrico and Chesterfield counties would have to be bused into the City of Richmond in order to decrease the high percentage of black students in Richmond's schools. This order was overturned by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on June 6, 1972, barring forced busing schemes that made students cross county/city boundaries. (Note: Since 1871, Virginia has had independent cities which are not politically located within counties, although some are completely surrounded geographically by a single county. This distinctive and unusual arrangement was pivotal in the Court of Appeals decision overturning Merhige's ruling). The percentage of white students in Richmond city schools declined from 45 to 21 percent between 1960 and 1975 and continued to decline over the next several decades. By 2010 white students accounted for less than 9 percent of student enrollment in Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.richmond.com/news/latest-news/report-schools-segregation-by-race-income-worsening/article_a05050c1-9ea8-5ebd-b00a-239aab565e7f.html&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called "white flight" prevented Richmond schools from ever becoming truly integrated.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/busing.htm School Busing - The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia]", Virginia Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt; A number of assignment plans were tried to address the non-racial concerns, and eventually, most elementary schools were "unpaired".

===Wilmington, Delaware===
In [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], Delaware, located in [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], segregated schools were required by law until 1954, when, due to ''[[Belton v. Gebhart]]'' (which was later rolled into ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' on appeal), the school system was forced to desegregate. As a result, the school districts in the Wilmington metropolitan area were split into eleven districts covering the metropolitan area (Alfred I. duPont, Alexis I. duPont, Claymont, Conrad, De La Warr, Marshallton-McKean, Mount Pleasant, New Castle-Gunning Bedford, Newark, Stanton, and Wilmington school districts). However, this reorganization did little to address the issue of segregation, since the Wilmington schools (Wilmington and De La Warr districts) remained predominantly black, while the suburban schools in the county outside the city limits remained predominantly white.

In 1976, the U.S. District Court, in ''[[Evans v. Buchanan]]'', ordered that the school districts of New Castle County all be combined into a single district governed by the New Castle County Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel B. Hoff, "[http://www.iccjournal.biz/Scholarly_Articles/Hoff,%20S/DelawareEducationandDesegregation.htm Delaware's Constitution and Its Impact on Education]"&lt;/ref&gt; The District Court ordered the Board to implement a desegregation plan in which the students from the predominantly black Wilmington and De La Warr districts were required to attend school in the predominantly white suburb districts, while students from the predominantly white districts were required to attend school in Wilmington or De La Warr districts for three years (usually 4th through 6th grade). In many cases, this required students to be bused a considerable distance (12–18 miles in the [[Christina School District]]) because of the distance between Wilmington and some of the major communities of the suburban area (such as [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]]).

However, the process of handling an entire metropolitan area as a single school district resulted in a revision to the plan in 1981, in which the New Castle County schools were again divided into four separate districts ([[Brandywine School District|Brandywine]], [[Christina School District|Christina]], [[Colonial School District (Delaware)|Colonial]], and [[Red Clay School District|Red Clay]])[http://www.iccjournal.biz/Scholarly_Articles/Hoff,%20S/DelawareEducationandDesegregation.htm]. However, unlike the 1954 districts, each of these districts was racially balanced and encompassed inner city and suburban areas. Each of the districts continued a desegregation plan based upon busing.

The requirements for maintaining racial balance in the schools of each of the districts was ended by the District Court in 1994, but the process of busing students to and from the suburbs for schooling continued largely unchanged until 2001, when the Delaware state government passed House Bill 300, mandating that the districts convert to sending students to the schools closest to them, a process that continues {{As of|2007|lc=on}}. In the 1990s, Delaware schools would utilize the Choice program, which would allow children to apply to schools in other school districts based on space.

Wilmington High, which, many felt, was a victim of the busing order, closed in 1998 due to dropping enrollment. The campus would become home to [[Cab Calloway School of the Arts]], a magnet school focused on the arts that was established in 1992. It would also house [[Charter School of Wilmington]], which focuses on math and science, and opened up in 1996.

Delaware currently has some of the highest rates in the nation of children who attend private schools, magnet schools, and charter schools, due to the perceived weaknesses of the public school system.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

== Re-segregation ==
{{See also|Auto-segregation|White flight|School segregation in the United States}}
According to the Civil Rights Project at [[Harvard University]], the desegregation of U.S. public schools peaked in 1988; since then, schools have become more segregated because of changes in demographic residential patterns with continuing growth in suburbs and new communities. [[Jonathan Kozol]] has found that as of 2005, the proportion of black students at majority-white schools was at "a level lower than in any year since 1968".&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J. [https://www.thenation.com/article/overcoming-apartheid/ "Overcoming Apartheid"], ''[[The Nation (U.S. periodical)|The Nation]]'', December 19, 2005. Retrieved April 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Changing population patterns, with dramatically increased growth in the South and Southwest, decreases in old industrial cities, and much increased immigration of new ethnic groups, have altered school populations in many areas.

School districts continue to try various programs to improve student and school performance, including magnet schools and special programs related to the economic standing of families.  Omaha proposed incorporating some suburban districts within city limits to enlarge its school-system catchment area. It wanted to create a "one tax, one school" system that would also allow it to create magnet programs to increase diversity in now predominately white schools. [[Ernie Chambers|Ernest Chambers]], a 34-year-serving black state senator from [[North Omaha, Nebraska|North Omaha]], Nebraska, believed a different solution was needed. Some observers said that in practical terms, public schools in Omaha had been re-segregated since the end of busing in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, T. A. (2009-02-03) "African American Administration of Predominately Black Schools: Segregation or Emancipation in Omaha, Nebraska", Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Association for the Study of Black Life and History in Charlotte, NC.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Chambers offered an amendment to the Omaha school reform bill in the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] which would provide for creation of three school districts in Omaha according to current racial demographics: black, white, and Hispanic, with local community control of each district.  He believed this would give the black community the chance to control a district in which their children were the majority. Chambers' amendment was controversial. Opponents to the measure described it as "state-sponsored segregation".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/us/15omaha.html?_r=1 Law to Segregate Omaha Schools Divides Nebraska]", ''[[The New York Times]]''. April 15, 2006. Retrieved April 12, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of a 2003 Harvard study on re-segregation believe current trends in the South of white teachers leaving predominately black schools is an inevitable result of federal court decisions limiting former methods of civil rights-era protections, such as busing and affirmative action in school admissions. Teachers and principals cite other issues, such as economic and cultural barriers in schools with high rates of poverty, as well as teachers' choices to work closer to home or in higher-performing schools. In some areas black teachers are also leaving the profession, resulting in teacher shortages.&lt;ref&gt;Jonnson, P. (January 21, 2003) "[http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0121/p01s03-usgn.html White teachers flee black schools]", ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''. Retrieved 4/12/09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education conservatives argue that any apparent separation of races is due to patterns of residential demographics not due to court decisions. They argue that the ''Brown'' decision has been achieved and that there is no segregation in the way that existed before the ruling. They further argue that employing race to impose desegregation policies discriminates and violates ''Brown''{{'}}s central warning of using racial preferences.&lt;ref name="Jost 345–372"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18654">In the United States, '''dual enrollment''' ('''DE'''), also called '''concurrent enrollment''', programs allow students to be enrolled in two separate, academically related institutions. Generally, it refers to [[high school]] students taking college or [[university]] courses. Less commonly, it may refer to any individual who is participating in two related programs.

==History==
Dual enrollment was first started in 1955 by the [https://ece.uconn.edu/ University of Connecticut]  under the direction of Provost Albert Waugh. It was his belief that the senior year in high school was not challenging enough for many students, resulting in student boredom and disinterest in learning - now called senioritis. He believed that it was the University's responsibility to engage with the high schools to offer introductory University courses at the high school, allowing a more rigorous academic experience and giving students a head start for college.  &lt;ref&gt;UConn Early College Experience Newsletter, Winter 2015 https://docs.google.com/viewerng/viewer?url=http://ece.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1356/2017/02/ECE-NEWSLETTER-WINTER-12_12.pdf&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990's a movement started to formalize a national accreditation body for concurrent and dual enrollment programs. In March 1997 the first national meeting of concurrent enrollment professionals was convened by [https://supa.syr.edu/ Syracuse University] at the American Association for Higher Education conference. Two years later, in 1999, 20 institutions of higher education officially established the [http://www.nacep.org/ National Alliance of Concurrent Enrollment Partnerships] - NACEP - by adopting bylaws and a mission statement. &lt;ref&gt;NACEP.org History http://www.nacep.org/about-nacep/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Students enrolled in [[secondary school]] may be simultaneously enrolled at a local institution of higher learning, such as a [[community college]] or university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ravallirepublic.com/news/local/article_fcf00eb6-ca54-11e6-a638-1bc90b13928c.html|title=Early college dual enrollment offers students a head start|last=Mcconnaha|first=Michelle|date=2016-12-24|website=Ravalli Republic|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; If students pass their college classes, they receive credit that may be applied toward their high school [[diploma]] and toward a college degree or certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ccrc.tc.columbia.edu/Publication.asp?uid=791 |title=Dual Enrollment: Postsecondary/Secondary Partnerships to Prepare Students|author=Hughes, K. L. |journal=Journal of College Science Teaching |volume= 39 |issue=6 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many state governments within the United States have recognized the benefit of dual enrollment and have consequently instructed their public universities to begin collaborating with local schools. Some private universities also participate. A 2011 study concluded that student experience differs dramatically from one program to the next.&lt;ref name="Edwards"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Linsey|last2=Hughes|first2=Katherine|last3=Weisberg|first3=Alan|title=Different Approaches to Dual Enrollment: Understanding Program Features and Their Implications.

Dual enrollment can be advantageous to students because it allows them to get a [[Head start (positioning)|head start]] on their college careers. In some cases, the student may even be able to attain an [[Associate of Arts]] or equivalent degree shortly before or after their high school graduation. Furthermore, participation in dual enrollment may ease the transition from high school to college by giving students a sense of what college academics are like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Conceptualizing Concurrent Enrollment Why High-Achieving Students Go For It|url = http://gcq.sagepub.com/content/59/4/249|journal = Gifted Child Quarterly|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 0016-9862|pages = 249–264|volume = 59|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0016986215597749|language = en|first = Lynn|last = Dare|first2 = Elizabeth|last2 = Nowicki}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, dual enrollment may be a cost-efficient way for students to accumulate college credits because courses are often paid for and taken through the local high school.

L. |author3= Weisberg, A. |last-author-amp=yes|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of which is concurrent enrollment. Concurrent enrollment is defined as credit hours earned when a high school student is taking a college course for both high school and college credit, during the high school day, on the high school campus, taught by a qualified high school instructor. Many prominent universities started the movement of concurrent enrollment - [https://ece.uconn.edu/ UConn Early College Experience] and [[Syracuse University]] [[Project Advance]]. In the George Washington Early College Program (GWECP-AA), students at the [[School Without Walls (Washington, D.C.)|School Without Walls]] Senior High School are enrolled at the [[George Washington University]] and take a full course-load at the university, along with other undergraduate students. These college courses are used to fulfill the students' high school graduation requirements for [[District of Columbia Public Schools]].

== Cost ==
Dual enrollment-like programs come with a cost, whether paid for by the student, school district or a combination of other state funded programs. Out of the fifty states in the United States, parents of students interested in the program are primarily responsible for the tuition cost in nine of those states. In Louisiana, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon and Tennessee, the states themselves are responsible for student tuition payment and in other states like Florida, the school district is responsible for the student dual enrollment program tuition. States may choose to go into a contract with a secondary institution and may be reimbursed upon students' satisfactory grade achievement. States and school districts may also choose to cover all or part of the tuition cost with a max college credit limit before the student is responsible for payment. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ecs.force.com/mbdata/MBQuestRT?Rep=DE1304|title=Dual Enrollment: Who Is Primarily Responsible for Paying Tuition|website=ecs.force.com|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Running Start]] programs allow students to take college classes at their local community college. One of the main differences between Running Start and a regular dual enrollment program is the cost. The Running Start program makes tuition rates lower for high school students. Since FAFSA does not allow high school students to receive student aid&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastweb.com/financial-aid/articles/are-dual-enrollment-students-considered-college-students-on-the-fafsa|title=Are "Dual Enrollment" Students Considered College Students on the FAFSA?|work=Fastweb|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Running Start removes some of the barriers high school students face in taking college courses.

Parents of students who are enrolled in a dual enrollment program may qualify for a tuition and fees tax deduction for up to $4,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://finance.zacks.com/high-school-college-credit-tuition-tax-deduction-2213.html|title=The High School College Credit Tuition Tax Deduction|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}From a financial stand point, in the United States some aspects grant funding to both the high school and colleges per student. It can be hard, unless explicitly states by law, to determine which institution should receive the funding. There have been cases in the past where both institutions claimed the state funds leading to the state paying for the student twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hiesterman|first=Matthew|year=2013|title=High School Students Attending College: A Study Of The Dual Enrollment Program And Its Impact On The Postsecondary Institution Of Brevard Community College|url=http://stars.library.ucf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3639&amp;context=etd|journal=|volume=|pages=24|via=University of Central Florida Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From a Student Point of View ===

A study on students in dual enrollment where participants were given pseudonyms and interviewed on their thoughts on what dual enrollment offered revealed some positive and some negative themes that appeared across the interviews&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.northshore.edu/early-college/dual/benefits.html|title=NSCC - Benefits of Dual Enrollment|website=www.northshore.edu|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Among the positives, students mentioned “exposure, learning the hidden curriculum, and independence and freedom.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/905919670|title=Dual enrollment policies, pathways, and perspectives|others=Taylor, Jason L.,, Pretlow, Joshua,|isbn=9781119054290|location=San Francisco, California|oclc=905919670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students further explained each theme during their interviews. Exposure referred to the general atmosphere of the college experience. Students were able to become more comfortable with being in a college setting and were more prepared for attending college once they graduated high school. “Learning the hidden curriculum” referred to students learning that college wasn’t just about learning the material a class was teaching them. They also needed to learn study habits, how to ask professors for help, and other beneficial student practices, all of which contrast to high school experiences. A student (whose pseudonym is Carmen) noted that high school teachers tend to hold the student’s hand and give them as much help as they can. This contrasts to college professors who only help students when asked to do so. “Independence and freedom” was often used by the students to describe themselves overcoming fear and maturing. Most students explained how they had much more freedom and often thought to themselves “I can do whatever I want.” These students then realized the consequences of doing whatever they felt like, and learned from their mistakes, and learned. One student even reflected on the actions of her past and said, “I feel so disrespectful now, now that I think about it.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The students didn’t have only positive things to say about dual enrollment. Three themes were found in their interviews: “issues in credit and grades, negative interactions with others, and limited support systems.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The biggest problem brought up by students was “issues in credit and grades.” Students often lamented how their grades in college classes would affect their overall high school transcript and quite often result in a lower GPA&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/2126/what-is-a-gpa-and-why-is-it-so-important.html|title=What is a GPA and Why Is It So Important? - MastersPortal.com|website=www.mastersportal.com|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They were worried how it would affect their acceptance rate in other colleges later on. “Negative interactions with others” was described by students with how they were treated. The students felt cast out as many college students would treat them differently and would even get remarks that made them felt threatened. The dual enrollment students reflect on their past actions might have warranted such treatment as Roger says, “we weren’t very mature.” The final negative theme – “limited support systems” – stems to both the college and the high school. Students described that, once enrolled in dual enrollment, their high school counsellors and other faculty seemed to work with the students less. They felt like they were no longer apart of the general group of the high school. In the college setting, where they were expected to know material from courses they may have not taken yet. The college tutoring sessions were held during times that the dual enrollment students couldn’t make. As Alicia says, “I didn’t feel like an actual student.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== From a Faculty Member Point of View ===

A survey taken by teachers, counselors, and principals from 35 high schools was held to learn the opinions of faculty on dual enrollment (the term concurrent enrollment was used in the study). When asked how the school was impacted, the responses were positive all around. Many of the responses focused on students being able to earn college credit and be introduced to a college atmosphere. When asked how the students were impacted, most of the responses were positive as well, except the survey item “the student considered for the first time going to college.” Many respondents were neutral with only 35% agreeing. Students were thought to have already planned to move on to college before trying dual enrollment. The faculty commented on how dual enrollment gave students the opportunity to gain college credit. Teachers focused on how the increased difficulty of college courses prepared them for later. Counselors and teachers both noticed personal gains in students as well. Students had an increase in confidence and were willing to participate in more challenging studies. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Students of Color and Low Income Students Point of View ===

Although dual enrollment generally has a positive success rate in relation to college enrollment and completion, the results for low-income students and students of color displays a major difference. As a whole, college completion rates among dual enrollment students and non-dual enrollment students is higher at 22 percent as well as college enrollment rates being 34 percent higher. When looking exclusively at dual credit students of color enrollment and completion rates compared to non-dual credit the numbers show an obvious positive outcome with a 26 percent higher enrollment rate and 14 percent higher completion rate. Looking at those success rates against the success rates of other students researchers found a gap ranging from 4 to 8 percent. A study that took place in Florida was able to combat these results with their own when they found the number of dual credit students of color and non-dual credit to enroll and complete college was both equal. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Jason L.|date=October 2015|title=Accelerating Pathways to College: The (In)Equitable Effects of Community College Dual Credit|url=https://ezproxy.everettcc.edu:2060/docview/1719015685/98B05071779C47B8PQ/1?accountid=1167|journal=Accelerating Pathways to College: The (In)Equitable Effects of Community College Dual Credit|volume=43|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A University of Connecticut study (2016) indicated that students in middle-income and lower-income family quartiles had higher participation rates in concurrent enrollment programs than students in higher-income family quartiles. One attributing factor for these findings is that an increasing number of first-generation students and middle income families see the value of high-access low-cost opportunities because attending college is still aspirational and not guaranteed for students in these groups.  &lt;ref&gt;Boecherer, Brian A. (June 2016) ''Income Effects on Concurrent Enrollment Participation:  The Case of UConn Early College Experience.''  Chapter 16: Bridging the High School-College Gap: The Role of Concurrent Enrollment, Syracuse University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Concurrent and dual enrollment programs that waive or reduce fees to students participating in the Federal Free &amp; Reduced Lunch program can positively impact participation rates for these students.

==In College==
{{refimprove|section|date=December 2016}}
Colleges may create partnerships with schools that allow high school students to enroll in college classes or programs. Most universities have some degree of interdepartmental dual enrollment coordination. [[Arizona State University]], for example, partnered with a group of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] charter schools called ASU Preparatory Academy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://asuprep.asu.edu/|title=ASU Preparatory Academy {{!}}|website=asuprep.asu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The partnerships grants students the ability to enroll in one of ASU's online Global Freshman Academy courses as either independent study electives or while taking a similar higher level high school course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asuonline.asu.edu/newsroom/leading-educators/asu-prep-goes-extra-mile|title=ASU Prep Goes the Extra Mile|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High schools might also have a partnerships with a group of colleges, such as [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/consortium|title=The Consortium {{!}} www.fivecolleges.edu|website=www.fivecolleges.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Seven Sisters (Northeast)]], or [[Five Colleges of Ohio]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ohio5.org/web/|title=Welcome to Five Colleges of Ohio {{!}} Five Colleges of Ohio|website=www.ohio5.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;. That allows students to benefit from the collective knowledge of all universities and prevent them from duplicating unnecessary course offerings at each institution. Most universities have some degree of interdepartmental dual enrollment coordination.

{{Education in Hong Kong}}
'''Education in Hong Kong''' is largely modelled on [[Education in the United Kingdom|that of the United Kingdom]], particularly the [[Education in England|English system]]. It is overseen by the Education Bureau and the Social Welfare Department.

In the 2013/14 school year, there are 569 primary schools, 514 secondary day schools and 61 special schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview on Primary Education|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/edu-system/primary-secondary/primary/overview/index.html|publisher=Education Bureau|accessdate=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Academic term#Hong Kong|academic year]] begins mid-year, usually starting in September.


==History==
Small village Chinese schools were observed by the British missionaries when they arrived circa 1843.&lt;ref&gt;The Chinese Repository, Article III 'Religious and Charitable Institutions in Hongkong:Churches, Chapels, Schools, Colleges, Hospital, etc' August 1843 issue, p.440&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Sweeting believes those small village schools existed in [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Chek Chue]] (modern-day town of [[Stanley, Hong Kong|Stanley]]), [[Shek Pai Wan]], [[Heung Kong Tsai]] (modern-day [[Aberdeen, Hong Kong|Aberdeen]]) and [[Wong Nai Chong]] on [[Hong Kong Island]], although proof is no longer available.&lt;ref name="Sweeting"&gt;Sweeting, Anthony. [1990] (1990). Education in Hong Kong, pre-1841 to 1941. p.87, Hong Kong University Press. {{ISBN|962-209-258-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest schools with reliable records was [[Li Ying College]] established in 1075 in present-day [[New Territories]].&lt;ref name="Brynpdf"&gt;Bryn Mawr College. "[http://www.brynmawr.edu/eastasian/pdf/Tang.pdf Brynmawr Eastasian pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070511045950/http://www.brynmawr.edu/eastasian/pdf/Tang.pdf |date=11 May 2007 }}." "brynmawr.edu." Retrieved on 15 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1860 Hong Kong had 20 village schools. Chinese who were wealthy did not educate their children in Hong Kong, but instead sent them to major Chinese cities, such as [[Canton (Guangzhou)|Canton]], for traditional Chinese education.&lt;ref name="Brynpdf" /&gt;

The changes came with the arrival of the [[British Colony|British]] in 1841. At first Hong Kong's education came from [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] [[missionaries]] who provided social services. Italian missionaries began to provide [[Single-sex education|boy-only education]] to British and Chinese youth in 1843.&lt;ref name="Bray"&gt;Bray, Mark. Koo, Ramsey. [2005] (2005) Education and Society in Hong Kong and Macao: Comparative Perspectives on Continuity and Change. Hong Kong: Springer Press. {{ISBN|1-4020-3405-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1861 [[Frederick Stewart (colonial administrator)|Frederick Stewart]] became "The Founder of Hong Kong Education" for integrating a modern western-style education model into the [[Colonial Hong Kong]] school system,.&lt;ref&gt;Wiltshire, Trea. [First published 1987] (republished &amp; reduced 2003). Old Hong Kong – Volume One. Central, Hong Kong: Text Form Asia books Ltd. Page 8. ISBN Volume One 962-7283-59-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1862, the first government school, [[Queen's College, Hong Kong|Queen's College]] (then Government Central School) was set up, with Stewart serving as the first Headmaster.

One of the much contested debate was whether schools should offer [[Vernacular]] education, teaching in Chinese at all.&lt;ref name="Sweeting" /&gt; Education was considered a luxury for the elite and the rich. The first school to open the floodgate of western medical practice to East Asia was the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]]. The [[London Missionary Society]] and Sir James Cantlie started the [[Hong Kong College of Medicine for Chinese]] in 1887 (although, the 'for Chinese' was later dropped from the name).&lt;ref&gt;Ingrams, Harold, ''Hong Kong'' (Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London: 1952), p.213.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the [[London Missionary Society]] founded [[Ying Wa Girls' School]] in 1900. [[Belilios Public School]] was a girls' secondary school founded in 1890 – the first government school in Hong Kong that provided bilingual education in English and Chinese. The push for [[Sinology|Chinese education]] in a British system did not begin until the rise of social awareness of the Chinese community following the 1919 [[May Fourth Movement]] and 1934 [[New Life Movement]] in China.&lt;ref name="Sweeting" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brynpdf" /&gt; Educating the poor did not become a priority until they accounted for the majority of the population. Financial issues were addressed in the [[1970s in Hong Kong|1970s]].&lt;ref name="EhNet"&gt;Eh Net. "[http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/schenk.HongKong Eh Net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213192705/http://eh.net/encyclopedia/article/schenk.HongKong |date=13 February 2007 }}." ''Hong Kong History.'' Retrieved on 21 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

A small group of South Asian [[Hong Konger]]s marched through [[Central, Hong Kong|Central]] demanding more schooling in the English language on 3 June 2007.&lt;ref name="HkMarchers"&gt;Hk Marchers.

==Pre-school education==

Pre-school education in Hong Kong is not free and fees are payable by pupils' parents. However, parents whose children have the right of abode in Hong Kong can pay for part of their fees with a voucher from the government under the Pre-primary Education Voucher Scheme (PEVS). In 2013, the amount of subsidy under the PEVS is $16,800.

===Secondary education===

'''Secondary education''' is separated into junior and senior years. In junior years, the curriculum is a broad one where history, geography and science are studied alongside subjects that have already been studied at primary schools. In senior years, this becomes more selective and students have a choice over what and how much is to be studied. Almost all schools but [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]] and its feeder junior secondary college have both sessions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itseducation.asia/education-system.htm|title=The Hong Kong Education System and school system explained|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further education===

Commerce stream in secondary schools are considered [[Vocational Education|vocational]] in nature. Students in the Commerce stream would usually enter the workplace to gain practical work experience by this point. Further education pursuit in Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education or universities abroad are common. The [[Manpower Development Committee]] (MDC) advises the government on co-ordination, regulation and promotion of the sector. In addition, the [[Vocational Training Council]] (VTC) ensures the level of standard is met through the ''"Apprentice Ordinance"''. The VTC also operate three skills-centres for people with disabilities. secondary schools in Hong Kong are going to be cut down to only two years due to the switch in the government.

===Alternative education options===

International institutions provide both primary and secondary education in Hong Kong. International institutions like schools within the [[English Schools Foundation]], [[Li Po Chun United World College]], [[Hong Kong International School]], [[American International School Hong Kong]], [[Chinese International School]], [http://www.vsa.edu.hk Victoria Shanghai Academy] [[German Swiss International School]], [[Canadian International School of Hong Kong|Canadian International School]], [[Hong Kong Japanese School]], [[Lycée Français International Victor Segalen|French International School]], [[Yew Chung International School]], [[Po Leung Kuk Choi Kai Yau School]], [[Singapore International School]] and [[Harrow International School Hong Kong]] teach with English as the primary language, with some sections bilingual in German, French and Chinese. International school students rarely take Hong Kong public exams. British students take [[GCSE]], [[IGCSE]] and A-levels. US students take [[Advanced Placement|AP]]s. Increasingly, international schools follow the [[International Baccalaureate]] (IBDP) program, and enter universities through non-[[JUPAS]] direct entry. International students apply on a per school basis, whereas Hong Kong local students submit 1 application for multiple local universities as a JUPAS applicant.

==Tertiary and Higher education==

[[File:The University of Hong Kong.jpg|thumb|[[University of Hong Kong]].]]
{{Main article|Higher education in Hong Kong}}

Higher education remains exclusive in Hong Kong. Fewer than 20,000 students are offered places funded by the government every year, although this number has more than doubled over the last three decades.

As a result, many continue their studies abroad. The following is some of the destinations that students in Hong Kong go to for tertiary education and their respective numbers.&lt;ref name="Bray" /&gt;

==Adult education==

Adult education is popular, since it gives [[middle age]] adults a chance to obtain a tertiary degree. The concept was not common several decades ago. The [[Education and Manpower Bureau|EMB]] has commissioned two non-profit school operators to provide evening courses. The operators have fee remission schemes to help adult learners in need of financial assistance. Adult education courses also provide Vocational Training Council through universities and private institutions. The [[Open University of Hong Kong]] is one establishment for mature students. Several secondary schools operate adult education sessions, the first being [[Cheung Sha Wan Catholic Secondary School]], while [[PLK Vicwood KT Chong Sixth Form College]] offers [[associate degree]] and joint-degree programmes.

==Education for immigrant and non-Cantonese-speaking children==

The Education Bureau provides education services for immigrant children from [[Mainland China]] and other countries, as well as non-Cantonese-speaking Hong Kong children. Free "Induction Programmes" of up to 60 hours have been offered to NAC by non-government organisations. The EMB also provides a 6-month full-time "Initiation Programme" incorporating both academic and non-academic support services, for NAC before they are formally placed into mainstream schools. Hayes Tang (2002) provided a good sociology of education thesis on the [http://sunzi.lib.hku.hk/hkuto/record/B29803810 NACs' adaptation and school performance]

==International education==

As of January 2015, the International Schools Consultancy (ISC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/|title=International School Consultancy Group &gt; Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; listed Hong Kong as having 175 international schools.&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|title=International School Consultancy Group &gt; Information &gt; ISC News|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms "ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country’s national curriculum and is international in its orientation."&lt;ref name="iscresearch.com"/&gt; This definition is used by publications including ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21636757-english-language-schools-once-aimed-expatriates-now-cater-domestic-elites-new|title=The new local|date=17 December 2014|journal=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are top-rated exempted courses where courses offered overseas are collaborated with local institutions in Hong Kong to broaden the scope of [[Tertiary Education]] in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/tc/edu-system/postsecondary/non-local-higher-professional-edu/course/exempted-course.html|title=獲豁免課程名單|author=|date=|website=www.edb.gov.hk|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[MIT]] has an innovation node in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hkinnovationnode.mit.edu/news/|title=News - MIT Hong Kong Innovation Node|author=|date=|website=MIT Hong Kong Innovation Node|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Class size==
{{unreferenced|section|date=May 2018}}
Many primary schools in Hong Kong offer half-day schooling, splitting by AM and PM to handle the demand. The two sessions are usually treated as separate school entities with two different headmasters. To make up for the time of shortened half days, students are sometimes required to attend alternate Saturdays. Most primary schools are gradually moving to full school day systems as government policy aims to phase out half-day schooling over time as resource permits.

Due to the drop in [[birth rate]] in recent years, many primary schools were forced to cut classes, cut teachers and even close down. There have been debates that one should seize the opportunity to promote small class teaching.  Doing so could mitigate the pressure of teachers, class and school reductions, on top of improving ratio of students to teachers.

==Discipline==

Good behaviour has always been emphasised in Hong Kong, to the point that it is sometimes said to hinder pupils' development. Misbehavior is recorded and shown on school reports. The Education Bureau (EDB) provides the 'Guidelines for Student Disciplines' to schools to as guidance in creating a disciplined education environment. It outlines the principles and policies regarding student discipline, the organisational structure of a school discipline team, the roles and responsibilities of the discipline master and mistress, and discipline strategies illustrated with case studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=|title=Student Guidance and Discipline Services|url=http://www.edb.gov.hk/en/student-parents/student-guidance-discipline-services/overview/index.html|website=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{see also|Hong Kong Kids phenomenon|Monster parents}}

===Spoon feeding===

Education in Hong Kong has often been described as 'spoon fed'. [[Cram schools in Hong Kong]] have also become a popular standard in parallel to regular education. Teachers focus on helping students getting high scores in the major exams and heavily rely on textbook knowledge rather than exchanging ideas and essence of the subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chong, Chan|first1=Dennis, Joyee|title=Students 'spoon-fed'|url=http://www.scmp.com/article/1006323/students-spoon-fed|accessdate=4 August 2015|agency=South China Morning Post|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education reform===
{{OR-section|date=June 2018}}
With the advent of education reform there is a greater emphasis on group projects, open-ended assignments on top of traditional homework. The current workload of a primary student in Hong Kong includes approximately two hours of schoolwork nightly. Along with [[extra-curricular activities]], Hong Kong's education has become synonymous for leaning towards quantity. As early as March 1987, education advisory inspectors became concerned with the excessive amounts of "mechanical work and meaningless homework".&lt;ref name="Vickers"&gt;Vickers, Edward. [2003] (2003). In Search of an Identity: The Politics of History Teaching in Hong Kong, 1960s–2000. United Kingdom: Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, history education has been recognised as ineffective, with critics claiming that the curriculum is not capable of delivering a sense of identity. Not only that, students have to memorise the whole history texts, thereby indicating that rote-learning has greater priority than absorbing and understanding material.&lt;ref name="Vickers" /&gt;

Some {{who|date=March 2017}} have criticised the system for having too narrow of a stream focus, too early on. [[Hong Kong Legislative Council|Legco]] Member [[Alan Leong]] argued in a guest lecture at the Chinese University of Hong Kong that secondary level science students are incapable of participating in meaningful discussions on history, arts, or literature.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Vice versa journalists of arts stream background are incapable of accurately discussing technological issues. The narrow focus of education in Hong Kong has been a concern.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

The pervasive perception from observers in overseas education institutions generally is that a typical Hong Kong student compared with other students, even against other students in the Asia region, lacks systematic decision-making confidence and relies on repetition and undeveloped answers. This deviates from the common benchmark of intellect where value propositions are generated from innovation and distinctive solutions, and this has led to much schism in the debate of educational direction of Hong Kong, where the populace makes no such aspiration for intellect but seek constant reaffirmation of the value of myriad certificates obtained through pedagogy throughout their working lives. The desperation to seek standing in life through education is further highlighted by severe ironies such as:

# Senior education officials often acclaim the excellence of Hong Kong education, yet few if any will let their children matriculate locally, preferring overseas universities instead.
# A certificate driven society that takes pride in its academic excellence is unable to devise a suitable benchmark of excellence itself, with a low public approval of the local educational system, relies on certification from outside Hong Kong.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

The '''Federal Centre for Health Education''' ({{lang-de|Bundeszentrale für gesundheitliche Aufklärung}}; '''BZgA''') is a federal authority within the portfolio of the German [[Federal Ministry of Health (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Health]]. The Authority has its headquarters in [[Cologne]] and is headed by [[Heidrun Thaiss]]. The BZgA was founded in 1967. 

== Tasks ==
The BZgA has the task of promoting the willingness of citizens to act responsibly to meet their health needs and to use the health care system properly. The main focuses of the BZgA are [[AIDS prevention]], [[sex education]], [[drug abuse prevention]] for both legal and illegal drugs, [[child and youth health]], [[healthy eating]] and [[organ donation]]. In addition, the Federal Centre for Health Education performs studies and investigations in order to improve their educational work. The studies are published regularly. 

At its inception the BZgA had the following tasks:
* Development of guidelines and principles for the content and the methods of practical health education
* Education and training of people in the field of health education and information
* Coordination of health information and health education in the federal territory
* Cooperation with foreign countries in these fields

== Paycheck poverty ==
More than 3 in 4 full-time American workers live from paycheck to paycheck with a lack of savings for emergencies.&lt;ref name="Boyle2018"/&gt; As such, emergencies such as a broken boiler or an urgent medical expense can send a worker into a spiral of debt.&lt;ref name="Boyle2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/walmart-s-fintech-partner-helps-break-paycheck-to-paycheck-cycle|title=Walmart’s Fintech Partner Helps Break Paycheck-to Paycheck Cycle|last=Boyle|first=Matthew|date=19 July 2018|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=More than three out of four Americans say they live paycheck to paycheck. ... The inability to weather an unexpected car repair bill or medical expense can a send low-income worker in a debt spiral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many established institutions have offered financial wellness programs for a number of years with seemingly limited success.&lt;ref name="Fed2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications.htm|title=Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017|year=2018|publisher=Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|page=21|quote=Four in 10 adults in 2017 would either borrow, sell something, or not be able pay if faced with a $400 emergency expense. While still disconcertingly large, the share of families who would struggle with such an expense has decreased over the past five years. In 2013, half of adults could not easily cover such an expense. Even with the improvement, financial challenges remain for many families. One in five adults cannot cover their current month’s bills, and one in four skipped a medical treatment in the past year due to an inability to pay.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the situation has improved somewhat with the recovery in the economy, a 2018 report from the [[Federal Reserve Board]] stated that, in 2017, 41% of adults “would either have to borrow or sell something or not be able to pay if faced with a $400 emergency expense” which they described as “disconcertingly large”.&lt;ref name="Fed2018"/&gt; 

In response to these issues there has been a growing awareness of the concept of financial wellness and the benefits of workplace programs to provide support to employees.&lt;ref name="Unser2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickunser/2018/04/17/more-buzz-than-action-with-financial-wellness|title=More Buzz Than Action With Financial Wellness?|last=Unser|first=Rick|date=17 April 2018|publisher=[[Forbes]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Financial wellness is a process to engage employees and improve one or more aspects of their relationship with money. ... With a little communication and minimal cost, you can make a big impact on the financial futures of your employees.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in technology are providing employers the opportunity to offer the option of money management tools to their employees, which Matthew Boyle writes, may help them break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.&lt;ref name="2018Boyle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-07-19/walmart-s-fintech-partner-helps-break-paycheck-to-paycheck-cycle|title=Walmart’s Fintech Partner Helps Break Paycheck-to Paycheck Cycle|last=Boyle|first=Matthew|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|language=English|accessdate=26 September 2018|quote=Walmart Inc.’s employees have adopted money-management tools from Even Responsible Finance Inc. at a faster pace than anticipated, prompting a fresh round of funding to expand the fintech start-up.

Financial wellness concerns the management of the financial health of an individual, supporting a balance between their short-term and long-term financial needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=The 2018 Bank of America Merrill Lynch Workplace Benefits Report surveyed 657 employees who participate in 401(k) plans and 667 employers who offer a 401(k) and a financial wellness program. Employers, the survey found, tend to focus on actions to manage workers’ immediate financial needs, like budgeting and handling expenses. But employees prioritize long-term financial goals, such as ways to help them save and invest for the future.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Financial wellness programs work through employers supporting their employees’ goals with a program that provides them with the "ability to track their progress and accomplishments, factoring in their goals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=When both groups were asked what would help improve employee financial wellness the most, employees wanted practical guidance that would “focus on the single next thing to do — one step at a time.” By contrast, employers said: “considering the impact of employer benefits on overall personal finances.” Employees also said they want personalized advice from a professional, with the ability to track their progress and accomplishments, factoring in their goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the perspective of employees, financial wellness programs are successful if they have "minimal financial stress; a strong financial foundation (little or no debt, an emergency savings fund and are living below their means); and a plan they are following that puts them on track to meet future financial goals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2014/09/27/powell-financial-wellness-program-benefit/15457903|title=More companies offer financial wellness programs|last=Powell|first=Robert|date=27 September 2014|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=: Financial wellness, from an employees' perspective, is a state of financial well-being, where they have: minimal financial stress; a strong financial foundation (little or no debt, an emergency savings fund and are living below their means); and a plan they are following that puts them on track to meet future financial goals.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 report by [[Michal Grinstein-Weiss|Grinstein-Weiss]] and Lass suggested that “successful financial wellness programs could offer opportunities for employees to improve their financial management, decision-making, and credit scores; increase job stability, work satisfaction, and short- and long-term investments; and decrease debt and financial stress.”&lt;ref name="Hannon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csd.wustl.edu/publications/documents/wp17-23.pdf|title=Employee Financial Wellness Programs: A Review of the Literature and Directions for Future Research|year=2017|publisher=[[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|author=Geraldine Hannon, Meredith Covington, Mat Despard, Ellen Frank-Miller, Michal Grinstein-Weiss|quote= Grinstein-Weiss and Lass (2013) reported that successful financial wellness programs could offer opportunities for employees to improve their financial management, decision making, and credit scores; increase job stability, work satisfaction, and short- and long-term investments; and decrease debt and financial stress.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Employers and FWPs ==
According to Grinstein-Weiss et al., a number of recent studies have “linked employee financial wellness to improved employer outcomes.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://csd.wustl.edu/publications/documents/wp17-23.pdf|title=Employee Financial Wellness Programs: A Review of the Literature and Directions for Future Research|year=2017|publisher=[[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|author=Geraldine Hannon, Meredith Covington, Mat Despard, Ellen Frank-Miller, Michal Grinstein-Weiss|quote= A number of recent studies linked employee financial wellness to improved employer outcomes. Financial wellness has been linked to improved productivity (Center for Credit Union Innovation, 2002; Stanford Center on Longevity, 2014), reduced distractions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The returns are potentially large. According to a report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau the return on investment for employers from comprehensive health wellness programs appears to be between $1 and $3 for each dollar invested and early evidence suggests that FWPs can be similarly effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-wellness-at-work/|title=Financial wellness at work: A review of promising practices and policies|last=Cordray|first=Richard|year=2014|publisher=[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=The return on investment to employers from comprehensive health wellness programs, though hard to pinpoint, appears to be large, ranging from $1 to $3 or more per dollar invested.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial wellness programs prioritize the recognition of the relationship with money and their financial literacy by employers, which is recognised in the [[Financial Literacy Month|National Financial Literacy Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/100615/why-financial-literacy-and-education-so-important.asp|title=Why financial literacy is so important|last=Zucchi|first=Kristina|date=26 January 2018|publisher=[[Investopedia]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A good financial wellness program can lead to less physical illness due to lower stress rates, a higher level of focus and in turn, an improved level of productivity.&lt;ref name="2014Powell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2014/09/27/powell-financial-wellness-program-benefit/15457903|title=More companies offer financial wellness programs|last=Powell|first=Robert|date=27 September 2014|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=From an employee perspective, it can lead to higher satisfaction and better knowledge of their employer benefits, less physical illness due to lower stress, higher productivity at work and, of course, financial security. ... What's more, financial wellness programs can reduce absenteeism, as well as disability and workers' compensation costs. That's because poor financial management causes stress, which sets the stage for medical problems, the CFPB said in its report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Powell writes that FWPs can reduce the number of employee absences, as well as disability and worker’s compensation costs and provide lower employee turnover and lower healthcare, therefore, directly benefiting employers’ return on investment.&lt;ref name="2014Powell"/&gt;

A report from the [[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]] commented on the relationship between productivity, spending and financial wellness:&lt;ref name="CFPB2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/financial-wellness-at-work/|title=Financial wellness at work: A review of promising practices and policies|last=Cordray|first=Richard|year=2014|publisher=[[Consumer Financial Protection Bureau]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Given the large costs that may be associated with financial stress in terms of productivity loss and higher health care spending, employers have a potentially large incentive to explore cost effective ways to enhance employee financial wellness.  Indeed, employees would also clearly benefit from any programs that reduced stress that may be linked to poor health.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, most workplaces do not offer financial wellness programs as an employee benefit, although a survey of 400 companies revealed that many bussinesses plan to focus on financial wellness in the future.&lt;ref name="2014RobertPowell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/money/columnist/powell/2014/09/27/powell-financial-wellness-program-benefit/15457903|title=More companies offer financial wellness programs|last=Powell|first=Robert|date=27 September 2014|publisher=[[USA Today]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=To be sure, most employers don't offer financial wellness programs. But three-quarters of about 400 large companies surveyed by Aon Hewitt survey say they're planning to focus more on financial wellness this year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Efficacy ==
Recently a report by [[Bank of America Merrill Lynch]] 2018 survey found that although 48% of the employees they surveyed were offered workplace financial welfare plans only 31% participate in them because the services offered were not of interest to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Little wonder, then, that Bank of America Merrill Lynch also found that although 48 percent of the employees surveyed were offered workplace financial wellness plans, only 31 percent participate in them. One reason employees said they demur: “Don’t offer services of interest to me.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC]] survey found that employees certainly wanted help with their financial decisions but for the majority, in practice, this means access to unbiased counselors providing help to understand and how to use the benefit they were being offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/private-company-services/library/financial-well-being-retirement-survey.html|title=2018 Employee Financial Wellness Survey: PwC|year=2018|publisher=[[PricewaterhouseCoopers]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=More than half of all employees want to make their own financial decisions but are looking to have someone validate that decision. Employees want a financial wellness benefit with access to unbiased counselors and help understanding and using their benefits.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans (2018) survey of employers found that one-to-one meetings were considered the most effective approach with the highest levels of participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nextavenue.org/workplace-financial-wellness-programs/?utm_source=sumome&amp;utm_medium=linkedin&amp;utm_campaign=sumome_share|title=Why Workplace Financial Wellness Program aren’t well|last=Eisenberg|first=Richard|date=1 August 2018|publisher=[[Next Avenue]]|language=English|accessdate=24 September 2018|quote=Employees also said they want personalized advice from a professional, with the ability to track their progress and accomplishments, factoring in their goals. Similarly, in the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans (IFEBP) 2018 survey of employers, in-person, one-on-one meetings were rated as the most effective meeting approach, with the highest participation rates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Gaelscoil''' ({{IPA-ga|ˈɡeːl̪ˠsˠkɛlʲ}}; plural: ''Gaelscoileanna'') is an [[Irish language|Irish]]-medium school in Ireland: the term refers especially to Irish-medium schools outside the Irish-speaking regions or [[Gaeltacht]]. Over 50,000 students attend Gaelscoileanna on the island of Ireland. A further over 13,000 students are receiving their primary and second level education through Irish in the Gaeltacht. Gaelscoileanna and Irish-medium schools in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by [[Gaeloideachas]] and [[An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp; Gaelscolaíochta]] or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Gaeloideachas and [[Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta]] in Northern Ireland.
[[File:Irish language medium school sign Newry.jpg|thumb|Sign for primary Gaelscoil in [[Newry]], Northern Ireland]]
[[File:Dublin City North 2009.jpg|thumb|[[County Dublin]] has over forty Irish language medium schools attended by over 13,000 pupils.]]

Students in the Gaelscoileanna acquire the Irish language through [[language immersion]], and study the standard curriculum through it. Gaelscoileanna, unlike English-medium schools, have the reputation of producing competent Irish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/en/immersion-education/cad-e-tumoideachaswhat-is-immersion-education/ |title=Retrieved 27 June 2011 |publisher=Gaelscoileanna.ie |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=2 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012153057/http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/en/immersion-education/cad-e-tumoideachaswhat-is-immersion-education/ |archivedate=12 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; English-medium schools, in contrast, produce relatively few fluent Irish speakers, despite the [[Irish language]] being an obligatory subject in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in both primary and secondary school. This has been attributed in part to the lack of Irish-language immersion programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comhairle.org/uploads/publications/Immersion%20Education%20Policy%20SGIP.pdf ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Their success is due to effective (though limited) community support and an efficient administrative infrastructure. They are distinguished by being the product, not of state policy, but of a genuine community movement.

[[File:Gaeloideachas logo.jpg|thumb|Gaelscoileanna and Irish language-medium schools in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by Gaeloideachas and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp; Gaelscolaíochta or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Gaeloideachas and Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta in Northern Ireland.]]

Gaelscoileanna have undergone a striking expansion over the last few decades, although there are now concerns that rules limiting the founding of new schools is affecting the establishment of new Irish-medium education in areas where there is a competition amongst educational patrons.

In 1972 there were only 11 such schools at primary level and five at secondary level in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. As of September 2017 there are 180 gaelscoileanna at primary level, attended by over 40,000 students, and 31 gaelcholáistí and 17 aonaid Ghaeilge (Irish language units) at secondary level, attended by over 11,000 students in non-[[Gaeltacht]] areas across [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="gaelscoileanna.ie"&gt;[http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/assets/Irish-Medium-Education_English.pdf Irish-Medium Education Outside The Gaeltacht 2012-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; 35 of these primary schools, 2 of the postprimary schools and 4 of the postprimary units operated are in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="gaelscoileanna.ie"/&gt; Additionally, some 4,000 children attend Irish-medium preschools or [[Naíonra | Naíonraí]] outside the Gaeltacht with around 1,000 children attending ''Naíonraí'' within the Gaeltacht.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} There is now at least one gaelscoil in every county in Ireland with over 40 in County Dublin; 30 in County Cork and 13 in County Antrim included.

==Social status and function==
Gaelscoileanna have acquired a reputation for providing excellent academic results at a moderate cost. They have been described as a system of "positive social selection,” giving better than average access to tertiary education and the social and employment opportunities which follow. An analysis of "feeder" schools which send students on to tertiary level institutions shows that 22% of Irish-medium schools send all their students on to tertiary level, compared to 7% of English-medium schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market|publisher=The Economic and Social Review, Vol. 40, No. 4, Winter, 2009|page=446|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters argue that the bilingualism resulting from early acquisition of another language is of general intellectual benefit and helps children to learn still other languages. Irish-language advocates of the immersion approach sometimes refer to studies showing that bilingual children have advantages over monoglot children in other subjects.&lt;ref name="B&amp;H"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bialystok and Hakuta|title=In Other Words: The Science and Psychology of Second-Language Acquisition|publisher=[[Basic Books]]|year=1994|location=New York|isbn=0-465-03281-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-primary education through Irish==
{{main article|Gaelcholáiste}}

At present over 11,000 students on the island of Ireland are receiving secondary education through Irish outside Gaeltacht areas. These include around 10,000 students in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name="gaelscoileanna" /&gt; Two new second-level gaelscoileanna opened in Ireland in 2014: Coláiste Ghlór na Mara in Balbriggan and Gaelcholáiste an Phiarsaigh in Rathfarnham (both in County Dublin). Gaelcholáiste Charraig Uí Leighin opened in Carrigaline and Northern Ireland's second gaelcholáiste, Gaelcholáiste Dhoire, opened in Dungiven Castle in 2015. There are also campaigns running for several new gaelcholáistí in other areas.

== 20-Year Strategy ==
The function and future of the Gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland will be affected by the [[20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030]], published in December 2010. This emphasises the importance of offering all children in primary schools in Ireland the opportunity to experience partial immersion in the formative years of primary education. It calls for primary teachers to have additional immersion classes to improve their competence in the language. This would involve teaching some subjects such as Mathematics and Science in Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20-YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage2010-2030/Publications/20-Year%20Strategy%20-%20English%20version.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017082918/http://www.ahg.gov.ie/en/20-YearStrategyfortheIrishLanguage2010-2030/Publications/20-Year%20Strategy%20-%20English%20version.pdf |archivedate=17 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} 20 Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-1230&lt;/ref&gt; Such a policy, if implemented effectively, may mean that the gaelscoileanna will no longer be the largest means of promoting Irish/English language bilingualism in schoolchildren.

'''George William Lewis''' (March 10, 1882 &amp;ndash; July 12, 1948) was the Director of Aeronautical Research at the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] (NACA) until he retired in 1947.  He taught at [[Swarthmore College]] from 1910 to 1917.

==Biography==
In 1910, George Lewis graduated from [[Cornell University]] with a Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering and proceeded to teach at [[Swarthmore College]] until 1917.  He became involved in aircraft engines which led to his membership in NACA's Power Plants Subcommittee.  In 1919, he was appointed as NACA's first Executive Officer.  Five years later, he was named as the Director of Aeronautical Research, a position he held until his retirement.  During those years, Lewis was stationed in [[Washington, D.C.]] to handle many of NACA's political and bureaucratic issues.  At the same time, he oversaw research advancements and technical publications at NACA's [[Langley Research Center]].  During his time as director, engineers at the Langley facility were responsible for numerous advancements in the understanding of [[aerodynamics]].  These achievements earned Lewis international renown and NACA expanded from a few employees to several thousand during his tenure.

[[Hugh Latimer Dryden|Dr. Hugh L. Dryden]] succeeded Lewis as the Director of Aeronautical Research at NACA.  The [[Glenn Research Center|NASA John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] is partly named after him.

The '''Ghana Code Club''' is an [[After-school activity|after-school program]] in [[Ghana]], Africa, that teaches children [[computer programming]] skills.&lt;ref name="Quashie 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GW-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AfricaCodeWeek 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GHS-1"/&gt; The program was founded by Ernestina Edem Appiah, and the program is organized in various schools by Healthy Career Initiative, a [[nonprofit organization]] in Ghana.&lt;ref name="Quashie 2015"/&gt; Healthy Career Initiative was also founded by Appiah, in 2007.&lt;ref name="AfricaCodeWeek 2014"/&gt; Ghana Code Club is a digital fun club that is being organized in schools in Ghana for children between the ages of 8–17.&lt;ref name="Quashie 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatora 2016"/&gt; It is an after-school [[Extracurricular activity|extracurricular]] program.&lt;ref name="Quashie 2015"/&gt;

As of January 2016 in Ghana, the present information communications technology [[curriculum]] in Ghana does not include learning activities for technology.&lt;ref name="GW-1"/&gt; The club encourages children to attain modern skills in computer technology to help them with future careers.&lt;ref name="GW-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AfricaCodeWeek 2014"/&gt; Some of the activities include learning how to create websites, animations and video games.&lt;ref name="Quashie 2015"/&gt; In January 2016, the program began operations in five schools, and the organization is prepared to expand into most schools in Ghana in 2016, with a goal of educating at least 20,000 children.&lt;ref name="GW-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chatora 2016"/&gt;

Challenges faced by the Ghana Code Club includes problems with internet connectivity in Ghana, and access to capital and computer equipment. As a result, a significant portion of the classes are presently taught on paper with printouts.&lt;ref name="Chatora 2016"/&gt;

==History==
The founder and CEO of Ghana Code Club is [[Ernestina Edem Appiah]],&lt;ref name="GW-1"/&gt;  Her interest  was initiated by an article she read about children in the United Kingdom learning coding (computer programming).&lt;ref name="GW-1"/&gt; Appiah was one of the BBC's 100 Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pulse-ghana.stage.blick.frz.tfag.de/innovation/pulse-womens-month-meet-ernestina-edem-appiah-the-ict-whisperer-id4372836.html|title=Pulse Women's Month: Meet Ernestina Edem Appiah, the ICT whisperer - Innovation - Pulse|last=Quashie|first=Sena|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11155">This glossary of education-related terms is based on how they commonly are used in Wikipedia articles. This page contains terms starting with T – Z. Select a letter from the table of contents to find terms on other pages.

{{Glossary of education-related terms TOC}}

==T==

* '''''[[Taxonomy of Educational Objectives]]:''''' An educational taxonomy that classifies educational objectives into three domains: cognitive, affective, and psychomotor.
* '''[[Teacher]]:''' In [[education]], one who teaches [[student]]s or pupils, often a course of study, [[lesson plan]], or a practical skill, including learning and thinking skills. There are many different ways to teach and help students [[learn]]. This is often referred to as the teacher's [[pedagogy]]. When deciding what teaching method to use, a teacher will need to consider students' background knowledge, environment, and their learning goals as well as standardized curriculum as determined by their school district.
* '''[[Technology education]]:''' The study of the human ability to create and use tools to shape the natural environment to meet their needs. The goal of technology education is to spread [[technological literacy]] which is accomplished by bringing laboratory activities to students.  The term "technology education" is frequently shortened to "tech ed".
* '''[[Technology Integration]]:''' A term used by [[educators]] to describe effective uses of [[technology]] by [[teacher]]s and [[students]] in [[K-12]] and [[university]] [[classroom]]s. Teachers use technology to support instruction in [[language]] arts, [[social studies]], [[science]], [[math]], or other content areas. When teachers integrate technology into their classroom practice, learners are empowered to be actively engaged in their learning.
* '''[[Tertiary education]]:''' (also referred to as '''third-stage''' or '''third level education''') The educational level following the completion of a school providing a [[secondary education]] such as a [[high school]], [[secondary school]], or [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]].  Tertiary education is commonly [[higher education]] which prepares students for a [[quaternary education]].
:[[College]]s and [[university|universities]] are examples of institutions that provide tertiary education. The term Tertiary education can also be used to refer to [[vocational education|vocational education and training]].

* '''[[Textbook]]:''' A [[Owners manual|manual]] of [[Education|instruction]] or a standard [[book]] in any branch of study. They are classified by both the target audience and the subject. Textbooks are usually published by specialty printers to serve every request for an understanding of every subject that can be taught. It is a big business that requires mass volume sales to make the publications profitable. Although most textbooks are only published in printed format with hard covers, some can now be viewed online.
* '''[[Theory of cognitive development]]:''' A [[developmental psychology]] theory developed by [[Jean Piaget]] to explain cognitive development. The theory is central to [[child psychology]] and is based on [[Schema (psychology)|schemata]]&amp;mdash;schemes of how one perceives the world&amp;mdash;in "[[critical period]]s," times when children are particularly susceptible to certain information.
* '''[[Theory of multiple intelligences]]:''' A [[psychological]] and [[educational]] [[theory]] formulated by [[Howard Gardner]] espousing that eight kinds of "[[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]]" exist in humans, each relating to a different sphere of human life and activity.
* '''''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]]:''''', (also known as '''''The Times Higher''''' or '''''The THES''''') A [[newspaper]] based in [[London]] that reports specifically on issues related to [[higher education]]. It is owned by TSL Education, which was, until October 2005, a division of [[News International]]. The paper is edited by John O'Leary, author of ''[[League Tables of British Universities|The Times Good University Guide]]''. The THES is probably best known for publishing ''The Times Higher World University Rankings'' (see [[college and university rankings]]), which first appeared in November 2004, with new rankings published annually.
* '''[[Training]]:''' Refers to the acquisition of knowledge, skills, attitudes as a result of the teaching of vocational or practical skills and knowledge and relates to specific useful skills. It forms the core of [[apprenticeship]]s and provides the backbone of content at [[technical college]]s or polytechnics. Today it is often referred to as [[professional development]].
* '''[[Truth]]:''' When someone sincerely agrees with an assertion, he or she is claiming that it is the '''truth'''. [[Philosophy]] seeks answers for certain questions about truth and the word ''truth''.
* '''[[Tuition]]:''' Instruction, teaching or a fee charged for educational instruction especially at a formal institution of learning. Tuition is charged by educational institutions to assist with funding of staff and faculty, course offerings, lab equipment, computer systems, libraries, facility upkeeping, and to provide a comfortable learning experience for its students.

==U==

* '''[[Understanding]]:''' A [[psychology|psychological]] process related to an abstract or physical object, such as, person, situation and message whereby one is able to think about it and use [[concept]]s to deal adequately with that object.
* '''[[UNESCO]]:''' The '''United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization''', commonly known as '''UNESCO''', is a specialized agency of the [[United Nations]] established in 1945. Its purpose is to contribute to [[peace]] and [[security]] by promoting [[international]] [[collaboration]] through [[education]], [[science]], and [[culture]] in order to further universal [[respect]] for [[justice]], the rule of [[law]], and the [[human rights]] and fundamental [[Freedom (political)|freedoms]] proclaimed in the [[United Nations Charter|UN Charter]].
* '''[[Universal preschool]]:''' The notion that access to [[preschool]] should be available to families similar to [[Kindergarten]]. Child advocates have different definitions of the definition of who is included and how it is to be funded. There has been a move to change the name to Preschool for All. Like Kindergarten, the concept is to have a voluntary program, unlike education, that is mandated by law in the United States with exceptions to allow for [[homeschooling]] and [[alternative education]].
* '''[[Unobservable]]s:''' Entities whose existence, nature, properties, qualities or relations are not observable.  In the [[philosophy of science]] typical examples of "unobservables" are [[atom|atomic particles]], the [[gravity|force of gravity]], [[causality|causation]] and [[belief]]s or desires. However, philosophers also characterize ''all'' objects—trees, tables, other minds, microbiological things and so on to which humans ascribe as the thing causing their perception—as unobservable.

==V==

[[Image:VII фестиваль кузнечного мастерства 36.JPG|right|thumb|150px|A [[blacksmith]] is a traditional trade.]]
* '''[[Virtual learning environment]]:''' ('''VLE''') A [[software]] system designed to facilitate teachers in the management of educational courses for their students, especially by helping [[teacher]]s and learners with course administration. The system can often track the learners' progress, which can be monitored by both teachers and learners. While often thought of as primarily tools for distance education, they are most often used to supplement the face-to-face classroom.
* '''[[Visual learning]]:''' A proven teaching method in which [[graphic organizers]], such as webs, [[concept map]]s idea maps, and slide shows are used to help students of all ages think and learn more effectively.
* '''[[Vocational education]]:''' (or '''Vocational Education and Training''' (VET)) Prepares learners for careers or [[profession]]s that are traditionally non-[[academics|academic]] and directly related to a specific trade, occupation or ''[[vocation]]'', hence the term, in which the learner participates. It is sometimes referred to as ''technical education'', as the learner directly specialises in a particular narrow technique of using [[technology]].

==W==

* '''[[Waldorf education]]''' Waldorf education (also known as Steiner education) is a humanistic approach to pedagogy based on the educational philosophy of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, the founder of anthroposophy. Learning is interdisciplinary, integrating practical, artistic, and conceptual elements. The approach emphasizes the role of the imagination in learning, developing thinking that includes a creative as well as an analytic component.
* '''[[Whole language]]:''' A term used by [[Reading (activity)|reading]] [[teacher]]s to describe an instructional philosophy which focuses on reading as an activity best taught in a broader context of meaning. Rather than focusing on reading as a mechanical skill, it is taught as an ongoing part of every student's existing language and life experience. Building on language skills each student already possesses, reading and writing are seen as a part of a broader "whole language" spectrum.
* '''[[Wisdom]]:''' The ability to make correct judgments and decisions. It is an intangible quality gained through [[experience]] some think. Yet others think it is a quality that even a child, otherwise immature, may possess independent of experience or complete knowledge.  Whether or not something is '''wise''' is determined in a pragmatic sense by its popularity, how long it has been around, and its ability to predict against future events. Wisdom is also accepted from [[cultural]], [[philosophical]] and [[religious]] sources.  Some think of wisdom as foreseeing consequences and acting to maximize beneficial results.
* '''[[Writing]]:''' May refer to two activities: the inscribing of characters on a medium, with the intention of forming [[Word (linguistics)|word]]s and other constructs that represent [[language]] or record [[information]], and the creation of material to be conveyed through written language. (There are some exceptions; for example, the use of a [[typewriter]] to record language is generally called typing, rather than writing.) Writing refers to both activities equally, and both activities may often occur simultaneously.
* '''[[Workshop]]:''' A brief intensive course, a seminar or a series of meetings emphasizing interaction and exchange of information among a usually small number of participants..

==X==
*xylophone. a musical instrument
* x-axis, part of an axis

==Z==
*[[Zero tolerance (schools)|Zero tolerance policy]]. A policy that states that prohibited behaviors and actions will not be tolerated—no exceptions.

A '''handbook''' is a type of [[reference work]], or other collection of instructions, that is intended to provide ready reference. The term originally applied to a small or portable book containing information useful for its owner,  but the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the current sense as "any book...giving information such as facts on a particular subject, guidance in some art or occupation, instructions for operating a machine, or information for tourists."&lt;ref&gt;[http://0-www.oed.com.catalogue.libraries.london.ac.uk/view/Entry/83815?redirectedFrom=handbook#eid Oxford English Dictionary Online], accessed 23 March 2017. {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

A handbook is sometimes referred to as a '''''[[wikt:en:vade mecum#Latin|vade mecum]]''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]], "go with me") or '''pocket reference'''. It may also be referred to as an [[enchiridion (disambiguation)|enchiridion]].

Handbooks may deal with any topic, and are generally compendiums of information in a particular field or about a particular technique. They are designed to be easily consulted and provide quick answers in a certain area. For example, the [[MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers]] is a reference for how to cite works in MLA style, among other things. Examples of [[engineering]] handbooks include  ''[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]'', ''[[Marks Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers]]'', and the ''[[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]''.

The '''Jersey Accommodation and Activity Centre''' is a building just north of [[Gorey, Jersey|Gorey]] in [[Saint Martin, Jersey|the parish of Saint Martin]], [[Jersey]], in the [[Channel Islands]]. It was formerly known as the Industrial School, the '''Jersey Home for Boys''', and '''Haut de la Garenne'''. Its previous uses have included being an [[industrial school]], a [[Orphanage|children's home]], a military signal station, a television filming location, and a [[hostel|youth hostel]]. In 2008 it became the focus of the largest [[Jersey child abuse investigation 2008|investigation]] into [[child abuse]] ever conducted in Jersey.

==History==
[[File:Haut de la Garenne Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey 26 Juin 1867.jpg|thumb|An account of the opening of the industrial school in 1867 in ''La Nouvelle Chronique de Jersey'']]
Haut de la Garenne began in 1867 as an industrial school for "young people of the lower classes of society and neglected children".&lt;ref name="bbc080224"&gt;{{cite news

By 1900 it had become the Jersey Home for Boys and continued as a children's home for many years. In 1921 the [[States of Jersey]] took over the buildings and most of the powers of the Assembly of Governor, Bailiff and Jurats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Occupation of the Channel Islands|German Occupation]] during [[World War II|the Second World War]], the [[Bundeswehr|German military]] used the building as a [[signal station]]. Following the Liberation of 1945, the building continued as a children's home with responsibility being taken over by the Education Committee.&lt;ref name="1998report" /&gt; On 17 March 1960 the States adopted an act changing the name of the institution to Haut de la Garenne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5chtm%5cROFiles%5cR%26O4000-4999%2fJersey_R_%26_O_4127.htm HAUT DE LA GARENNE ACT 1960] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506171721/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%5Chtm%5CROFiles%5CR&amp;O4000-4999%2FJersey_R_&amp;_O_4127.htm |date=2016-05-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s the home received both boys and girls, but as care policy developed the number of children in care was reduced from 1970 onwards. A new wing for staff accommodation was built on the western part of the site in 1970.&lt;ref name="1998report" /&gt; After the home closed in 1986, the building was used to portray a [[police station]] in the TV detective series ''[[Bergerac (TV series)|Bergerac]]''.&lt;ref name="Ind080224"&gt;{{cite news

[[File:Haut de la Garenne war memorial.jpg|thumb|left|The memorial standing in front of the building records the names of those former pupils who fell in the First World War]]
The Public Works Committee took over the building from the Education Committee in 1986. The building was put to a number of temporary uses while a permanent solution to using the building was considered. It was considered as a potential site for the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] unit. [[St. Michael's Preparatory School]] leased a dormitory block for a time, and the headmaster proposed leasing the whole site for educational and sporting purposes. In 1989 the dormitory wing was converted for use by the Education Committee as temporary respite care for children with special education needs.&lt;ref name="JEP1990"&gt;''The house is not a home – but what will they do with Haut de la Garenne?'', [[Jersey Evening Post]], 8 March 1990&lt;/ref&gt; However the Public Works Committee decided in favour of selling the property in order to purchase a commercial site in Saint Helier for development as housing, or of agreeing a land swap with a hotel in Saint Helier whereby the hotel would develop Haut de la Garenne as a luxury hotel and thereby free the urban hotel site for housing development.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Evening Post, 29 June 1989&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal for a luxury hotel development spurred parishioners of Saint Martin to call a [[Parish Assembly (Jersey)|Parish Assembly]] by means of a requête. This Assembly, held in August 1989, voted to oppose a hotel development at Haut de la Garenne, but indicated that a proposal for a [[sheltered housing]] development might be acceptable.&lt;ref name="JEP1990" /&gt;

In 1991 the States approved a scheme to retain the 1970 wing for respite care, convert the main building for sheltered housing, and construct new housing on the eastern part of the site. This decision was reversed, and in 1992 the Planning and Environment Committee took over administration of the site from Public Services, and the building was used for temporary accommodation for visiting groups of musicians and sportspeople, especially during festivals. Discussions continued on how to use the 2,137 square metres of available building floor area&lt;ref name="1998report" /&gt;

On  8 December 1998 the States voted to establish a trust to manage and operate Haut de la Garenne as a residential centre. On 22 October 2002 the States adopted a ''Law granting an Act of Incorporation to the Association called "The Haut de la Garenne Trust"''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce/htm/LawFiles/2003/L-01-2003.htm Law granting an Act of Incorporation to the Association called "The Haut de la Garenne Trust"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305015056/http://www.jerseylaw.je/Law/display.aspx?url=lawsinforce%2Fhtm%2FLawFiles%2F2003%2FL-01-2003.htm |date=2008-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The States spent £2.25m in 2003 to convert the building into a youth hostel,&lt;ref name="bbc_hostel"&gt;

===Child abuse investigation===
{{main|Jersey child abuse investigation 2008}}
Police moved into the hostel in February 2008 as part of an investigation into historical [[child abuse]]. The investigation showed numerous instances of child abuse against past residents, and led to the conviction of a former resident and a former member of staff.

Initial reports suggested that human remains and other evidence of torture and/or murder had been found. These reports were later denied by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1084985/4m-Jersey-House-Horrors-investigation-shut-police-chiefs-admit-NO-children-murdered.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | title=£4m Jersey 'House of Horrors' investigation shut down after police chiefs admit NO children were murdered in care home | first1=Andrew | last1=Malone | first2=Arthur | last2=Martin | date=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 journalist [[Leah McGrath Goodman]] was banned from the UK for two years while doing research on the abuse allegations. Politicians such as [[John Hemming (politician)|John Hemming]] and Trevor Pitman attempted to get the ban lifted so she could finish her work and publish her findings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sthelier.je/elected-members/deputies/ Your Parish Online, St Helier], retr 2012 9 13 from sthelier.je&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2012-13/504 Early day motion 504], UK Parliament, Session: 2012–13, Date tabled: 11.09.2012, Primary sponsor: Hemming, John.

In July 2013, a major inquiry into the allegations led by a senior UK judge was announced.&lt;ref name="leahmcgrathgoodman.com"/&gt;  In its report in July 2017 the inquiry recommended that Haut de la Garenne be demolished as it was a reminder of an "unhappy past or shameful history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40485015 |title=Jersey child abuse: 'Demolish Haut de la Garenne' |work=BBC News |date=3 July 2017 |accessdate=3 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use==

In April 2011 it was relaunched under a new branding as the Jersey Accommodation and Activity Centre.

The Jersey Accommodation and Activity Centre offers bed and breakfast accommodation as a hub for [[Adventure travel|activity holidays]] in Jersey. The building is also intended to act as a learning centre, offering classes in business and administration, cookery, environmental studies and other subjects. The facility also provides meeting rooms for charities, sports clubs and associations, and acts as a venue for arts, crafts and dance. The facility is run jointly by two companies, Jersey Adventures and Jersey Odyssey.&lt;ref&gt;Jersey Evening Post, 12 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toponymy==
[[File:Rue de la Pouclée et des Quatre Chemins, Jersey.jpg|thumb|Haut de la Garenne is in La Rue de la Pouclée et des Quatre Chemins, Saint Martin.]]
''Haut de la Garenne'' is [[French language|French]] for ''top of the [[Free warren|warren]]''. The building is situated on Mont de la Garenne, a hill overlooking [[Mont Orgueil]] where [[rabbit]]s were hunted. This ''varenne'' of the King was a perquisite (privilege) of [[the Crown]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jersey Place Names'', [[Société Jersiaise]] 1986 {{ISBN|0-901897-17-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Influencing Machine: Brooke Gladstone on the Media''''' is a nonfiction [[graphic novel]] by journalist [[Brooke Gladstone]] and cartoonist [[Josh Neufeld]]. Gladstone describes the book as "a treatise on the relationship between us and the news media,"&lt;ref name="Neyfakh09"/&gt; further described by the ''[[New York Observer]]'' as "a manifesto on the role of the press in American history as told through a cartoon version of herself."&lt;ref name="Neyfakh09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Neyfakh |first=Leon |url=http://www.observer.com/2009/books/norton-buys-graphic-media-manifesto |title=Norton Buys Graphic Media Manifesto |journal=New York Observer |date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the book refers to ''[[On the Origin of the "Influencing Machine" in Schizophrenia]]'', a 1919 article written by psychoanalyst [[Viktor Tausk]]. 

== Publication history ==
''The Influencing Machine'' was released in hardcover in May 2011. A paperback edition with a new cover was released in May 2012.

== Synopsis ==
Much in the vein of [[Scott McCloud]]'s ''[[Understanding Comics]]'', Gladstone appears in the book as an illustrated character, taking the reader through two millennia of history — from the newspapers in Caesar's [[Rome]] to the [[penny press]] of the [[American Revolution]] and the activities of contemporary journalism. Issues discussed include bias, objectivity, [[misinformation]], ethics, and a large chapter on war reporting. In a reference to the Trausk's "[[Influencing Machine]]," the book debunks the notion that “The Media” is an external force, outside of our control. Instead, it posits that the media is a mirror — sometimes a distorted one — reflecting society's beliefs and morals back at itself.

== Reception ==
''The Influencing Machine'' received recognition from magazines, newspapers, and websites such as ''[[The New Yorker]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Briefly Noted," ''The New Yorker'' (October 3, 2011), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Public Radio]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2011/05/21/136494993/the-influencing-machine-traces-myths-of-the-media?sc=tw&amp;cc=share "AUTHOR INTERVIEWS: 'The Influencing Machine' Traces Myths Of The Media,"] National Public Radio "Weekend Edition" (May 21, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Associated Press]],&lt;ref&gt;Ramde, Dinesh.

The '''National Council of Educational Research and Training''' ('''NCERT''') is an autonomous organisation of the [[Government of India]] which was established on 1 September 1961 as a literary, scientific and charitable Society under the Societies' Registration Act (Act XXI of 1860). Its headquarters are located at [[Sri Aurbindo Marg]] in [[New Delhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/organisation/management/memorandum/memo.html/ |title= Memorandum Of Association |last=Kumar |first=Prabhat |access-date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hrushikesh Senapaty is director of the council since September 2015.

==Textbooks==
Textbooks published by NCERT are prescribed by the [[Central Board of Secondary Education]] (CBSE) from classes I to XII, with exceptions for a few subjects. Around 19 school boards from 14 states have adopted or adapted the books. Online textbooks can be downloaded from the epathshala website&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epathshala.nic.in/e-pathshala-4/flipbook/|title=Flipbook {{!}} NCERT {{!}} Learning on the go, Govt. of India|website=epathshala.nic.in|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Those who wish to adopt the textbooks are required to send a request to NCERT, upon which soft copies of the books are received. The material is press-ready and may be printed by paying a 5% royalty, and by acknowledging NCERT.

The textbooks are printed in colour and are amongst the least expensive books in Indian bookstores, with each for up to class VIII having a maximum price of Rs 50 (formerly Rs 30). Textbooks produced by private publishers are priced higher than those of NCERT. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why NCERT textbooks matter|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/open-page/why-ncert-textbooks-matter/article18400872.ece|publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=May 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a government policy decision in 2017, the NCERT will have the exclusive task of publishing central text books from 2018, and the role of CBSE will be limited to conducting examinations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/from-2018-only-ncert-to-publish-school-textbooks/articleshow/59036991.cms From 2018, only NCERT to publish school textbooks], The Times of India, 7 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History == 

The Government of India's [[Ministry of Education (India)|Ministry of Education]] resolved on 27 July 1961 to establish the National Council of Educational Research and Training, which formally began operation on 1 September 1961. The Council was formed by merging seven existing national government institutions, namely the Central Institute of Education, the Central Bureau of Textbook Research, the Central Bureau of Educational and Vocational Guidance, the Directorate of Extension Programmes for Secondary Education, the National Institute of Basic Education, the National Fundamental Education Centre, and the National Institute of Audio-Visual Education.&lt;ref name="leading"&gt;[http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/leading_the_change.pdf Leading the Change: 50 years of NCERT], NCERT, 19 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is separate from the [[National Council for Teacher Education]].

The NCERT was established with the agenda to design and support a common system of education which is national in character and also enables and encourages the diverse culture across the country. Based on the recommendations of the Education Commission(1964-66), the first national policy statement on education was issued in 1968. The policy endorsed the adoption of a uniform pattern of school education across country consisting of 10 years of general education program followed by 2 years of diversified schooling. 

'''The Curriculum for the Ten-year school:''' This framework came in 1975. It emphasised that a curriculum based on the principles laid out in the framework has to be developed on the basis of research. Thus for NCERT, the 1970s was a decade flushed with curriculum research and development activities to relate the content and process of education to Indian realities.

'''National Curriculum for Elementary and Secondary Education:''' This revised curriculum framework came in 1988 after the National Policy on Education(1986).It encompassed 12 years of school education and suggested a reorientation of curricular and instructional materials to make them more child-centred. It advocated bringing out examination reforms and the implementation of [[Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation]] at all stages of education.

'''National Curriculum Framework for School Education:''' This framework came in 2000. It stressed the need for a healthy, enjoyable and stress-free childhood and reduction of the curricular load. Thus an integrated and thematic approach was suggested, environmental education was emphasized upon and language and mathematics got integrated in the first two years of schooling.

Main article: [[National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005)]]

'''National Curriculum Framework:''' The council came up with a new National Curriculum Framework in 2005, drafted by a National Steering Committee. This exercise was based on 5 guiding principles:
# connecting knowledge to life outside school
# shift from the rote method of learning
# enriching the curriculum for overall development of children so that it goes beyond textbooks
# making examinations flexible and integrating them with classroom life and
# nurturing an identity informed by caring concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/leading_the_change.pdf|title=leading_the_change|last=|first=|date=|website=NCERT|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logo ==
The design of the NCERT logo is taken from an Ashokan period relic of the 3rd century BCE which was found in excavations near Maske in Raichur district, Karnataka. The motto has been taken from the [[Isha Upanishad]] and means 'life eternal through learning'.  The intertwined hansas symbolise the integration of the three aspects of the work of NCERT: 1. Research and development 2. Training, and 3. Extension&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/leading_the_change.pdf|title=leading_the_change|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ncert.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The council's objectives are:

i) To promote and conduct educational research, experimentation of innovative ideas and practice. 

ii) To develop [[National Curriculum Framework (NCF 2005)]], syllabi, and textbooks; teaching-learning materials and kits; training models and strategies; audio, video, and ICT materials. 

iii) Training of Pre-service and in-service teacher education and national and state level functionaries. 

iv) To collaborate with State, national and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncert.nic.in/oth_anoun/RFD_ncert.pdf|title=RFD_ncert.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ncert.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actions ==

NCERT has a comprehensive extension programme in which departments of the [[National Institute of Education]], [[Regional Institute of Education]], Central Institute of Vocational Education and field advisers' offices in the states are engaged in activities. Several programmes are organised in rural and backward areas to reach out to functionaries in these areas. 

The council acts as the Secretariat of the National Development Group for Educational Innovations. The council has been offering training facilities, usually through attachment programmes and participation in workshops, to education workers of other countries. The council publishes [[School textbooks|textbooks]] for school subjects from Classes I to XII. NCERT publishes books &amp; provides sample question papers that are used in government and private schools across India that follow the [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/only-ncert-books-at-all-cbse-schools/articleshow/57174456.cms|title=Only NCERT books at all CBSE schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online system named e-pathshala has been developed for disseminating educational e-resources including textbooks, audio, video, periodicals and a variety of other print and non-print materials, ensuring their free access through mobile phones and tablets (as e-pub) and from the web through laptops and desktops (as flipbooks).

==Controversies==
{{main|NCERT textbook controversies}}
Ever since its establishment, the organisation has faced a great deal of controversy and continues to do so today. The controversy centres around allegations of attempted saffronised rewriting of Indian history. Allegations of [[historical revisionism]] with a Hindu nationalist agenda arose in two periods: under the [[Janata Party]] government 1977 to 1980 and again under the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] government from 1998 to 2004. In 2012, the organisation has been blamed for publishing 'offensive' cartoons against [[B. R. Ambedkar|B.R. Ambedkar]], the architect of the Indian Constitution and thus lodging an insult to the Constitution, in its textbooks.{{cn|date=April 2017}} The controversy led to the resignation of NCERT chief advisors Yogendra Yadav and [[Suhas Palshikar]] and an apology from the government.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), the apex organisation that provides advice and support for the improvement of school education has been avoiding mentioning that most of the Indian subcontinent was ruled by the [[Marathas]] before the British [[East India Company]] conquered it in History books in India according to historian Sadanand More.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=May 3, 2013 |title=NCERT cuts short Shivaji's journey in std VII textbook|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/pune/report-ncert-cuts-short-shivaji-s-journey-in-std-vii-textbook-1830091 |newspaper=DNA India |location=Pune |publisher=DNA India |accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Intelligence University''' (NIU), formerly known as the '''National Defense Intelligence College''' and the '''Joint Military Intelligence College''', is a federally-chartered research university in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. NIU is the [[United States Intelligence Community|United States Intelligence Community's]] (IC) institution for higher learning in fields of study central to the profession of intelligence and national security. NIU awards undergraduate and graduate degrees, graduate certificates, and research fellowships to prepare personnel for senior positions in the IC and the broader national security enterprise. Since 1963, more than 80,000 military and civilian students have attended the university.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.ni-u.edu/news/NIU_Graduates_Largest_Number_2012.html&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly located at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]], NIU's primary campus is now located at [[Intelligence Community Campus-Bethesda]] (ICC-B) with five additional locations around the world. The university's [[John T. Hughes Library]] is also located at ICC-B. NIU is the only university in the [[United States]] where students can study and complete research at the [[Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information]] level.

National Intelligence University's [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] programs emphasize education through scholarly and applied research designed to help U.S. intelligence officers better understand the diverse range of geopolitical, strategic, and technological threats and opportunities affecting intelligence and national security. The university is organized into two separate academic units: the [[College of Strategic Intelligence]] and the [[Oettinger School of Science and Technology]]. Combined, the colleges cover a diverse and evolving range of international affairs issues and adversarial threats and capabilities, from cultural and religious conflicts to [[weapons of mass destruction|WMD]] proliferation, [[cybersecurity]] threats, [[terrorism]], [[transnational crime]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ni-u.edu/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/2017-18_Catalog_v.2.pdf|title=National Intelligence University 2017-2017 Catalog|last=|first=|date=Aug 2017|website=NIU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 Sep 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congressionally chartered and publicly-funded but with admissions restricted solely to current U.S. [[Intelligence officer]]s holding a [[Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information]] clearance, NIU is a small, non-resident university. Admissions are highly selective, but tuition is paid by the [[United States Government]].

==History==
The [[United States Department of Defense]] established the Defense Intelligence School in 1962 to consolidate existing [[U.S. Army]] and [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] academic programs in strategic intelligence. In 1980, the [[U.S. Congress]] authorized the school to award the Master of Science of Strategic Intelligence degree. In 1981, the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools accredited the School. That same year, DoD rechartered the institution as the Defense Intelligence College, placing additional emphasis on its research mission.

Since then, the university has added several off-campus programs at the [[National Security Agency]], the [[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]], and several regional centers and has encouraged an increase in enrollment from civilian agencies. On campus, it has also added two part-time graduate programs, one designed for military reservists. Students from throughout the Intelligence Community attend the university, and they include active duty and reserve military personnel from each of the services (including the Coast Guard), DoD, and other federal civilian employees.

Renamed the Joint Military Intelligence College in 1993, it educates the future leaders of the Intelligence Community by offering an undergraduate and graduate curriculum. In addition, the university sponsors research and publication opportunities for students and faculty, attracts distinguished speakers, and its students participate in field exercises and simulations in partnership with their peers at the military staff and war colleges.

==Vision and mission==
LTG [[Michael T. Flynn]], USA, director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, addressed NIU graduates, their families and guests at the 2012 graduation by stating, "Our vision—that NIU becomes the center of academic life for the intelligence community—will help shape graduates who address the range of mission challenges as a fully integrated community, and encourage lifelong learning as they continue to serve this nation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

NIU is an accredited federal degree granting institution educating and preparing intelligence officers to meet current and future challenges to the national security of the United States. NIU President Dr. David Ellison stressed in his 2012 graduation remarks that NIU addresses these challenges by helping students develop "depth in critical thinking" and "breadth in understanding the IC" and how focused research applies to analysis and addressing critical questions on national security.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Educational accreditation==
The university is authorized by the [[United States Congress]] to award the Bachelor of Science in Intelligence, the Master of Science and Technology Intelligence and the Master of Science of Strategic Intelligence degrees. The university is [[school accreditation|accredited]] by the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools|Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].

==Facilities and resources==
The John T. Hughes Library houses 2.5 million items, including books, unclassified intelligence documents, reference materials, periodicals, microfilms, video and cartographic items. The library subscribes to 2,000 international periodicals, newspapers, annuals, serials, and statistical reports. It is particularly strong in [[Russia]]n periodicals. The library has archival microfiche and microfilm collections of general and scholarly periodicals, [[Foreign Broadcast Information Service]] reports, and declassified documents.

The Office of Research within the university enables students to pursue projects that require research outside the Washington, DC, area, including overseas. The university encourages faculty research on intelligence issues and supports intelligence-related research by faculty from other DoD Schools. Faculty and student research is published in academic journals, in the university's Occasional Paper series, and in book-length special studies. Research results and thesis abstracts are also disseminated electronically to the Intelligence Community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21000">A '''parent-teacher conference''', '''parent-teacher interview''', '''parent-teacher night''' or '''parents' evening''', is a short meeting or conference between the parents and teachers of students to discuss a child's progress at school and find solutions to academic or behavioral problems.&lt;ref name="rabbitt"/&gt; Parent-teacher conferences supplement the information conveyed by [[report card]]s by focusing on students' specific strengths and weaknesses in individual subjects and generalizing the level of inter-curricular skills and competences.&lt;ref name ="hackmann"/&gt;

Most conferences take place without the presence of the students whose progress is being discussed,&lt;ref name ="hackmann"/&gt;  although there is evidence that their inclusion increases the productivity of the meetings.&lt;ref name ="minke"/&gt; The meetings are generally led by teachers who take a more active role in information sharing, with parents relegated mostly to the role of listeners.&lt;ref name="maclure"/&gt;

==Types==
Parent-teacher conferences exist in a variety of different forms, depending on a country, school district and individual school. The subtypes are characterized by the following attributes.

===Mode===
Like most other meetings, parent-teacher conferences can take the form of ''face-to-face meetings'' in which parents and teachers meet in person, or ''electronic meetings'' that are conducted over the phone or via video conferencing systems like Skype or Google Voice. Face-to-face meetings offer personal contact but require that parents and teachers meet at physically the same place during the meeting. These interviews are usually between five and fifteen minutes long.

In case of electronic parent-teacher conferences, neither parents nor teachers need to be at school or other common location and can participate in the meeting from home or while working or traveling. The school does not need to reserve rooms for the meetings and there is more flexibility in finding suitable time. The disadvantages of electronic are a lack of face time that many participants are used to and a need for the availability to unfailing technology.

Parent-teacher interviews are a tradition in Western school systems, such as [[Education in Australia|Australia]], [[Education in Canada|Canada]], the [[Education in the UK|UK]] and the [[Education in the United States|United States]]. In the United States, many elementary schools will shorten the school day by 2–3 hours (often for an entire week) in mid fall to allow extra time for teachers to give these conferences.

===Participants===
Parent-teacher conferences can be 
* one-on-one meetings between a parent and a teacher. This type is used when different subjects are taught by different teachers and parents meet the teachers for all different subjects individually. The type offers most confidentiality and allows the discussion of information specific to a student in a particular subject. The downside of the type is that the meetings are hard to schedule because they require multiple time slots and meeting places.
* many-to-one meeting is a meeting between multiple parents and one teacher. Usually the students whose parents attend the meeting are in the same class/year and the teacher is either the teacher of a particular subject or the assigned class teacher. This type is common in elementary schools. It is relatively easy to schedule but lacks privacy for discussing the progress of particular students.
* one-to-many meeting between one parent and multiple teachers. This type can be used if a child has problems in multiple subjects or when a parent comes to school outside the regularly scheduled parent-teacher conference time to meet several teachers at once.
* many-to-many meetings between multiple parents and multiple teachers. This type of meeting is easy to use for electing board members or disseminating general information about school, calendar of events, changes in common regulations, etc. It is inefficient for discussing issues that are specific of particular students and lacks needed privacy.

===Frequency===
Parent-teacher conferences usually take place once every school term, although some schools organize only one meeting during (mostly at the beginning of) the school year.

===Duration===
The duration of parent-teacher conferences depends on the frequency of conferences and the number of participating parents and teachers. Annual meetings with multiple participants may last two hours or longer; one-to-many and many-to-one meetings once a term may last for an hour; one-on-one meetings once a year may last 15 minutes, one-on-one meetings once a term tend to last 5–10 minutes.&lt;ref name ="hackmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maclure"/&gt;

===Location===
Most face-to-face meetings take place at school. One-to-many meetings may take place in separate meeting rooms, many-to-one meetings in larger classrooms and one-to-one and many-to-one meetings in the school hall, aula or auditorium, with many one-to-one meetings happening simultaneously in different parts of the room.&lt;ref name="swiderek"/&gt;

==Regional variations==

===Australia===
In [[Education in Australia|Australian educational system]], the meetings are known as parent-teacher interviews or parents' nights.&lt;ref name="EdMat"/&gt; The exact practice varies by state and by school type. Some states mandate that the interviews be conducted, others do not. Government and non-government schools also follow different federal educational laws.

Some schools have only one round of interviews per year, others have more. Two rounds is common, with terms 1 (Feb-April) and 3 (July–September) being popular times. Many schools offer multiple dates, splitting interviews either by class or by name (e.g. a-k/l-z).

There is often keen demand by parents for times with teachers, though a common observation from teachers is that it is the parents who they ''don't'' need to see who attend interviews, while parents who ''should'' attend often do not.

===Canada===
In [[Education in Canada|Canadian educational system]], the meetings are known as parent-teacher interviews.&lt;ref name="CanLiv"/&gt;

Parent-teacher interviews are mandatory for all Ontario (Canada) elementary and [[secondary school]] teachers. Parents have the right to be allotted time for this purpose under the Ministry of Education.

''[[Canadian Living]]'' criticizes parent-teacher interviews for their [[Classism|class bias]]. Often only the most privileged children's parents will attend the interviews and the children more likely to need extra assistance will not have their parents attend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianliving.com/family/parenting/ask_an_expert_improving_parent_teacher_interviews.php 9 February 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the meeting is known as ''school parent meeting.&lt;ref name=singme/&gt;

===United States===
In [[Education in the United States|US educational system]], the meeting is known as ''parent-teacher conference''.&lt;ref name="minke"/&gt;

The conferences are usually held twice a year, at the end of the first quarter and  at the end of the third quarter, with meeting each lasting 15–20 minutes. The parents typically choose the time that is best for them, and the teacher schedules the conference accordingly. The specific practices vary within school districts.&lt;ref name = "hackmann"/&gt;

In the United States, many elementary schools will shorten the school day by 2–3 hours (often for an entire week) in mid fall to allow extra time for teachers to give these conferences.

The difference between parent-teacher conferences and a [[Parent-Teacher Association|PTA]] meetings is that the former focus on students' academic progress while the latter organize more extra-curricular activities.

Some counties in US have proposed to consider it a legal violation for parents or guardians who fail to attend at least one parent-teacher conference during the school year.&lt;ref name="FoxDetroit"/&gt; However, some charter schools have made the event a requirement for parents to attend.

===United Kingdom===
In [[Education in the UK|UK educational system]], the meeting is known as ''parent-teacher conference'' or ''parents' evening''.&lt;ref name="maclure"/&gt; The event is often held in the school hall and adjacent communal spaces where parents move through a series of eight to nine face-to-face 5 minute consultations with individual teachers.&lt;ref name="maclure"/&gt;

==Scheduling==

===The task===
Scheduling parent-teacher conferences involves finding a time that suits both parents and teachers with their existing time constraints and finding locations for the meetings. If all meetings would be independent without any dependencies, the planning of the meetings simplifies to unordered [[school timetable|timetabling]] rather than full-scale [[schedule|scheduling]] where events need to be scheduled in a certain order, often because the output of one event forms an input for another.

In most cases, certain dependencies exist: parents prefer not to wait too long between different interviews but need long enough breaks to move from one location to another or locations in close proximity.

===Methods===
Various methods exist for scheduling parent-teacher conferences.

In the simplest case, the meetings are not pre-scheduled at all, parents come to school and line up to see each teacher they want to see. Meetings happen on a [[First-come, first-served|first-come]] basis.&lt;ref name="swiderek"/&gt;

Meetings can be scheduled in person, by phone or on-line.

====In person====
In person scheduling comes in two flavors:
# Parents come to school's administrative office to schedule meetings; scheduling is done by a school administrator. 
# Students schedule meeting times with teachers by carrying a booking sheet and asking teachers to allocate times that are still available. Teachers have their own booking sheet and they mark the time on both sheets. Parents usually have the option of indicating which teachers they wish to see and the preferred times.&lt;ref name="maclure"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EdMat"/&gt;

The advantage of the first is that teachers need not be involved in scheduling, the disadvantages are that a special middleman is required. The method is centralized in the sense that it is directed by neither a parent nor a teacher.

The advantage of the second is that parents need not be involved in scheduling, the disadvantages are that teachers need to do the scheduling after their classes are over or during break times that they would otherwise need for rest, prepare for classes or advising students, parents do not know which slots the teachers have available and often get times that aren't suitable or optimal (booking schedules are optimized from the point of view of the teacher, not the parent); if a student doesn't want his/her parent to see teachers, all he/she may just not make the bookings, or leave it so late that there are no times available.

====By phone====
Scheduling by phone also involves a parent and a school administrator to do the scheduling without parents needing to be physically at school at the time of the scheduling. In principle, the middlemen could be avoided by automated scheduling by phone but is currently hindered by the lack of sophisticated speech analysis. This process can cause high levels of demand on school offices.

====On-line====
On-line scheduling is done by internet using [[appointment scheduling software]]. The advantages of the system are that it is automated without a need for a middleman, centrally optimized both for parents and for teachers without the need to involve students.

===Complexity===
Computationally, the scheduling problem is a [[NP-complete]] problem and in the same [[complexity class]] with other problems that involve
[[constraint satisfaction problem|constraint satisfaction]] and [[combinatorial optimization]] (so no fast algorithms are known for solving it).

This can be seen as follows. We can check in time polynomial to the input size whether certain time slot assignment satisfies parent-teacher conference scheduling (PTCS) constraints. Therefore, PTCS ∈ NP. Ignoring constraints that complicate scheduling even further, let's only consider the constraints on parent availability (e.g. assuming that all teachers, rooms and time slots are always available). Then there exists a simple [[polynomial transformation]] of the class-teacher assignment problem with teacher availability constraints (CTTA) in school timetable construction &lt;ref name="Willemen"/&gt;  to the PTCS problem: namely, map class instances to teacher instances, teacher instances to parent instances, time slots to time slots (identity map), and teacher availability to parent availability. So if the PTCS problem were polynomial-time solvable by some algorithm, the transformation described above and the algorithm could be used to solve the CTTA problem too and the CTTA task would be polynomially solvable as well. But CTTA has been earlier proved to be NP-complete by the reduction from the NP-complete [[3-satisfiability|3-SAT]] problem,&lt;ref name="Even"/&gt; so the PTC scheduling problem cannot be polynomially solvable either, and has to be NP-complete.

==Management==
Optimized scheduling is advantageous only as long as the participants keep to the schedule by attending the meetings and starting and finishing on time. The latter can be achieved by a school bell or electronic voice-over message played over the school PA system, at each change of interview time (E.g. "''Please move to your next interview''"), avoiding to schedule very short interview times that are harder to keep running on time, scheduling empty slots at intervals to assist in bringing events back onto time if they are running over. General [[time management]] techniques apply.

===On-time running===
Parents sometimes complain schedules are not running on time, causing them to miss interviews, or be cut short. This is usually due to either parents or teachers electing to continue talking beyond their booked time slot. One factor that naturally reduces this effect is the presence of another parent ready to start the next interview and clearly in view of the teacher. There are several other options that can assist on-time running of events:
* Bell, chime or electronic voice-over automatically played over the school PA system, at each change of interview time. (E.g. "''Please move to your next interview''")
* Large clock display projected on the hall screen, ensuring there is no doubt of the exact time, and encouraging participants to be mindful of the time.
* Strongly reminding, and encouraging teachers to stick to advertised times.
* Steering away from very short interview times, which are harder to maintain on-time running (e.g. 5 minutes), in favour of slightly longer duration interviews that may better suit the time required to talk about issues. Short durations like five minutes ensure more can fit into the event, yet if on-time running fails, the benefit is lost.
* Provision of spacer interview slots at intervals for all teachers with busy schedules, to act as a time buffer – assisting in bringing events back onto time if they are running over.
* Systems that offer optimised scheduling of interviews can provide significantly more compact parent schedules. Parents then have reason to finish their current conversation on time, namely to get to their own next meeting. The natural tendency is often for parents stay longer at an interview, which may be acceptable if both the parent and the teacher do not have another interview immediately following. Optimised parent schedules are also beneficial to the parents by reducing time on-site, and by significantly reducing numbers of idle parents (event congestion).

==Discussion==
Parent-teacher conferences have been criticized for their [[Classism|class bias]] and inefficiency because the meetings are attended mostly by the parents of more privileged children, while the parents of the children who are more likely to need extra assistance do not attend.&lt;ref name="CanLiv"/&gt;

The '''Partnership for Environmental Education, Inc'''. (PFEE), is a Florida not-for-profit organization (began January 1995), that was formed by a diverse group of community leaders, educators and business people for the purpose of encouraging, promoting and supporting environmental education, stewardship, and careers.  PFEE brings together students, scientists, educators, businesses and governmental agencies to promote a sustainable environmental legacy for our region.&lt;ref&gt;Palm Beach County School Board's Reference Page to PFEE : https://www.edline.net/pages/Jupiter_High_School/Career_Academies/JERFSA/Partnership_For_Environmental_&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PFEE was founded in order to provide funding for the activities of the [[Jupiter Environmental Research and Field Studies Academy]] (JERFSA).  JERFSA students require adequate funding for various community service, field study, and other research programs.  PFEE was founded by parents, teachers, and students two years after the JERFSA program began and order to raise these funds.  Since then the program has continued and expanded and provides not only funding, but a connection to businesses and the community for the JERFSA program.&lt;ref&gt;Monofilament Program Comes to Palm Beach County : http://chum-bucket.com/18060-fishing-lines.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Charity Guide]] : http://www.charity-charities.org/charityinfo.php?ID=442863&amp;page=10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mint Portal Reference : http://mintportal.bvdep.com/MintPortal-FKDKBIDINHAIDIGINHBIAIHIJI.urk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Town of Jupiter Town Council Report Referencing PFEE : http://www.jupiter.fl.us/agendas/TownCouncil/2008/TC-100708/19.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tax Exempt World Listing : http://www.taxexemptworld.com/organization.asp?tn=528082&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Non Profit Data : http://www.nonprofitdata.com/33468/partnership-for-environmental-education-inc.phtml?&amp;cmd=650599576&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manta Profile : http://www.manta.com/coms2/dnbcompany_gwg5tf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the [[Italian Ministry of Education]] included the Politecnico di studi aziendali in a list of private institutions which are not allowed to issue valid academic qualifications.&lt;ref name=cimea /&gt;

ISSEA is a member of the general assembly of [[EMUNI University]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emuni.si/en/about-emuni/organisation&lt;/ref&gt; so it can receive European public funds (such as €50,000 in 2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emuni.si/en/strani/444/Master-I.N.P.D.A.P.-Certificated.html |title=Borse di studio Master INPDAP Certificate |date=30 April 2005 |access-date=11 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808054330/http://www.emuni.si/en/strani/444/Master-I.N.P.D.A.P.-Certificated.html |archive-date=8 August 2012 |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tio.ch/News/Ticino/Cronaca/1035885/Lauree-sotto-inchiesta-Ci-insegnavano-a-pulire-le-cozze/ |title=Lauree sotto inchiesta: "Ci insegnavano a pulire le cozze" |last=Ilarietti |first=Davide |date=18 June 2015 |accessdate=27 August 2015 |language=it |trans-title=Degrees under investigation: «They taught us how to clean mussels»}}&lt;/ref&gt;—although Switzerland is not in the [[European Union]]—and is certified by SQS.ch with registry number 34044.

In 2016, the [[Canton of Grisons]]' parliament asked to stop the company from operating even in the new location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rsi.ch/news/ticino-e-grigioni-e-insubria/Grigioni-università-fantasma-5973100.html |title=Grigioni, università fantasma |date=28 August 2015 |language=it |trans-title=Ghost university in the Grisons' canton |accessdate=29 April 2016 |publisher=[[Radiotelevisione svizzera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, the unaccredited school moved to the [[Canton of Zug]].&lt;ref name=rsi-condanna&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rsi.ch/news/ticino-e-grigioni-e-insubria/Abuso-di-denominazione-7766744.html |title=Abuso di denominazione |date=19 July 2016 |language=it |trans-title=Unauthorized use of protected name |accessdate=27 October 2016 |publisher=[[Radiotelevisione svizzera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, in the tribunal of the Canton of Ticino, the company was convicted of unauthorized use of protected names ("university", "polytechnic" etc.)&lt;ref name=rsi-condanna /&gt;

== Other names ==
After the Swiss authorities declared the name "Politecnico di studi aziendali" illegal, the institution's [[ad]]s started to use different names as well, such as ''Polotecnico di studi aziendali'' (one vowel was changed) or ''Polo Tecnico di studi aziendali'' (literally: Technical research center of business studies, www.unipsa.net), ''Unipsa'', ''I.S.S.E.A. sa Scuola Universitaria Privata a Distanza'', ''C.I.S.M.A.D.'' (Centro Italiano Studi Multidisciplinari a Distanza, www.cismad.it), ''unisupdi.ch'' or ''Supsi'' (not to be confused with [[SUPSI]], an accredited Swiss university).&lt;ref name=ebr /&gt;

In 2016, after moving to Zug, the institution also started to use the name "Università telematica privata Unisanraffaele - Unise" (www.unise.ch) while maintaining all the previous names. The new name may be misleading because it closely resembles "[[Università telematica San Raffaele]]"—where "San" and "Raffaele" (Saint Raphael) are separated by a space—which is a real accredited Italian [[online university]].

An old website called "Private University Consortium" (www.umc-puc.edu),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umc-puc.edu:80/ |title=Private University Consortium |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014015057/http://www.umc-puc.edu/ |archive-date=14 October 2006 |accessdate=2 June 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; created in 1999 and deactivated in 2006, also sold degrees from [[Gibraltar]] under the name of "Università Mons Calpe", from [[Colorado]] under the name of "American Business School LLC", and from [[Panama]] under the name of "University Europanamense". The [[consortium]] was supposed to be headquartered in the same office as the Politecnico di studi aziendali in Ticino. All the institutions were unaccredited and all the offices no longer exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/6719_CIMEA_Against%20the%20mills_2010.pdf |title=CIMEA against the mills |access-date=2 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cimea.it/files/fileusers/2669_Fabbriche%20titoli%20parte_UQ23_CIMEA%202009.pdf |language=it |title=Fabbriche di titoli |trans-title=Diploma mills |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Univolta Università Telematica Privata Alessandro Volta ===
As of 2017, the institution is also being advertised as "Univolta Università Telematica Privata Alessandro Volta" (Online Private University [[Alessandro Volta]], www.univolta.ch), using the same office in Zug and the same [[domain name]] as the Politecnico di Studi Aziendali (www.unipsa.ch) — whose name has been declared illegal by Swiss authorities — as well as "Atena Unitelematica scuola universitaria www.uniatena.ch" (Telematic university [[Athena]]). At the same time, www.unipsa.net is being used by the aforementioned "Polo Tecnico di studi aziendali".&lt;ref name=ebr /&gt;

The '''Public Schools Act 1868''' was enacted by the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] to reform and regulate [[Public school (United Kingdom)|seven of the leading English boys' schools]] of the time, most of which had grown out of ancient [[charity school]]s for the education of a certain number of poor scholars, but were then, as they do today, also educating many sons of the English upper and upper-middle classes on a fee-paying basis.

The Act followed the report of the [[Clarendon Commission]], a [[Royal Commission]] on Public Schools which sat from 1861 to 1864 and investigated conditions and abuses which had grown up over the centuries at nine originally charity schools.&lt;ref&gt;Shrosbree 1988, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bill was presented for its first reading in the Lords by Lord Clarendon on 13 March 1865 and for its second reading on 3 April 1865. The Bill was in two parts, the first containing the general provisions of the Bill and the second containing specific proposals for each school.

[[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's School]] and [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]] were omitted, as they argued successfully that their constitutions made them legally "private" schools and that their constitutions could not be altered by public legislation,&lt;ref&gt;Shrosbree 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=P2gOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=public+schools+act+1868+st+pauls'&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tFonUbRrwoGFB62kgcgG&amp;ved=0CDwQuwUwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=public%20schools%20act%201868%20st%20pauls'&amp;f=false England Since Waterloo – Sir John Arthur Ransome Marriott – Google Books].

[[File:Piazza della Signoria.jpg|thumb|Urban space ([[Florence]])]]

A '''public space''' is a place that is generally open and accessible to people.  [[Road]]s (including the [[sidewalk|pavement]]), [[public square]]s, [[park]]s and [[beach]]es are typically considered public space. To a limited extent, government buildings which are open to the public, such as [[public library|public libraries]] are public spaces, although they tend to have restricted areas and greater limits upon use. Although not considered public space, privately owned buildings or property visible from sidewalks and public thoroughfares may affect the public visual landscape, for example, by outdoor advertising. Recently, the concept of [[Shared space]] has been advanced to enhance the experience of pedestrians in public space jointly used by automobiles and other vehicles.

Public space has also become something of a touchstone for [[critical theory]] in relation to [[philosophy]], (urban) [[geography]], [[visual art]], [[cultural studies]], [[social studies]] and [[urban design]]. The term 'public space' is also often misconstrued to mean other things such as '[[gathering place]]', which is an element of the larger concept of social space.

One of the earliest examples of public spaces are [[common land|commons]]. For example, no fees or paid [[Ticket (admission)|ticket]]s are required for entry. Non-government-owned malls are examples of 'private space' with the appearance of being 'public space'.

==Use of public spaces==

===Right to common passage===
In Nordic countries like Norway, Sweden, Finland and also Estonia, all nature areas are considered public space, due to a law, the ''[[allemansrätten]]'' (the right to common passage).

===Restrictions on state action in public spaces in the United States===
{{Rquote|right|If Members of the public had no right whatsoever to distribute leaflets or engage in other expressive activity on government-owned property...then there would be little if any opportunity to exercise their rights of freedom of expression.|[[Supreme Court of Canada]], defending right to poster on public utility poles and hand out leaflets in public government-owned buildings&lt;ref name="inter"&gt;Petersen, Klaus &amp; Allan C. Hutchinson. "Interpreting Censorship in Canada", [[University of Toronto Press]], 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the United States the right of the people to engage in speech and assembly in public places may not be unreasonably restricted by the federal or state government.&lt;ref&gt;[[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]&lt;/ref&gt; The government cannot usually limit one's speech beyond what is reasonable in a public space, which is considered to be a public [[forum (legal)|forum]] (that is, screaming epithets at passers-by can be stopped; proselytizing one's religion probably cannot).  In a private&amp;mdash;that is, non-public&amp;mdash;forum, the government can control one's speech to a much greater degree; for instance, protesting one's objection to medicare reform will not be tolerated in the gallery of the United States Senate. This is not to say that the government can control what one says in their own home or to others; it can only control government property in this way. The concept of a public forum is not limited to physical space or public property, for example, a newspaper might be considered a public forum, but see [[Forum (legal)|forum in the legal sense]] as the term has a specific meaning in United States law.

Parks, malls, beaches, waiting rooms, etc., may be closed at night. As this does not exclude any specific group, it is generally not considered a restriction on public use. Entry to public parks cannot be restricted based upon a user's residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classweb.gmu.edu/jkozlows/lawarts/10OCT01.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414211434/http://classweb.gmu.edu/jkozlows/lawarts/10OCT01.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social norms in public spaces===
In some cultures, there is no [[expectation of privacy]] in a public space, however [[civil inattention]] is a process whereby individuals are able to maintain their [[privacy]] within a crowd.

===Controversy regarding restrictions on use===
[[Image:LammasLand-485.JPG|thumb|right|180px|[[Leyton Marshes]], [[London]], an example of land with long established rights of access, and equally long-standing restrictions]]
Public space is commonly shared and created for open usage throughout the community, whereas private space is individually or corporately owned. The area is built for a range of various types of recreation and entertainment. The physical setting is [[socially constructed]], which creates a behavior influence. Limitations are imposed in the space to prevent certain actions from occurring--public behavior that is considered obnoxious or out of character (i.e., drug and alcohol consumption, urinating, [[indecent exposure]], etc.)--and are supported by law or [[Local ordinance|ordinance]]. Through the landscape and spatial organization of public space, the social construction is considered to be privately ruled by the implicit and explicit rules and expectations of the space that are enforced.

Whilst it is generally considered that everyone has a right to access and use public space, as opposed to private space which may have restrictions, there has been some academic interest in how public spaces are managed to exclude certain groups - specifically homeless&lt;ref name="homeless"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.nationalhomeless.org/publications/crimreport2004/introduction.html
|publisher=National Coalition for the Homeless
|title=Illegal to be Homeless
|year=2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; people and young&lt;ref name="youth"&gt;
{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; people.

Measures are taken to make the public space less attractive to them, including the removal or design of benches to restrict their use for sleeping and resting, restricting access to certain times, locking indoor/enclosed areas. Police forces are sometimes involved in moving 'unwanted' members of the public from public spaces. In fact, by not being provided suitable access, disabled people are implicitly excluded from some spaces.

===As a site for democracy===

Human geographers have argued that in spite of the exclusions that are part of public space, it can nonetheless be conceived of as a site where democracy becomes possible. [[Geographer]] Don Mitchell has written extensively on the topic of public space and its relation to democracy, employing [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s notion of the right to the city in articulating his argument.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Don. 2003, The Right to the City: Social Justice and the Fight for Public Space. New York: The Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While democracy and public space don't entirely coincide, it is the potential of their intersection that becomes politically important.  Other geographers like Gill Valentine have focused on [[performativity]] and visibility in public spaces, which brings a theatrical component or 'space of appearance' that is central to the functioning of a democratic space.&lt;ref&gt;Valentine, Gill, 1996, Children should be seen and not heard: the production and transgression of adults' public space . Urban Geography 17, 205-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privatization===
{{main|Privately owned public space}}
A '''privately owned public space''', also known as a '''[[Privately owned public space|privately owned public open space]] (POPOS)''', is a public space that is open to the public, but owned by a private entity, typically a commercial [[property developer]]. Conversion of [[Community ownership|publicly owned]] public spaces to privately owned public spaces is referred to as the [[privatization]] of public space, and is a common result of [[urban redevelopment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/jun/11/privately-owned-public-space-map|title=Privately owned public space: where are they and who owns them?|publisher=The Guardian|date=11 June 2012|accessdate=2012-09-01|location=London|first=Jeevan|last=Vasagar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning roughly in the 1960s, the privatization of public space (especially in urban centers) has faced criticism from citizen groups such as the [[Open Spaces Society]]. [[Private-public partnership]]s have taken significant control of public parks and playgrounds through conservancy groups set up to manage what is considered unmanageable by public agencies. Corporate sponsorship of public leisure areas is ubiquitous, giving open space to the public in exchange for higher [[air rights]]. This facilitates the construction of taller buildings with private parks.

In one of the newer U.S. incarnations of the private-public partnership, the [[business improvement district]] (BID), private organizations are allowed to tax local businesses and retail establishments so that they might provide special private services such as policing and increased surveillance, trash removal, or street renovation, all of which once fell under the control of public funds.

===Semi-public spaces===
A broader meaning of public space or place includes also places where everybody can come if they pay, like a [[café]], [[train]], or [[movie theater]]. A [[Retailing#Shops and Stores|shop]] is an example of what is intermediate between the two meanings: everybody can enter and look around without obligation to buy, but activities unrelated to the purpose of the shop are not unlimitedly permitted.

The [[hall]]s and streets (including [[skyway]]s) in a [[shopping center]] may be declared a public place and may be open when the shops are closed. Similarly for halls, [[railway platform]]s and [[waiting room]]s of [[public transport]]; sometimes a travelling ticket is required. A [[public library]] is a public place. A [[rest stop]] or [[truck stop]] is a public space.

For these "semi-public" spaces stricter rules may apply than outside, e.g. regarding [[dress code]], [[Trade|trading]], [[begging]], [[advertising]], [[photography]], [[propaganda]], riding [[rollerskate]]s, [[skateboard]]s, a [[Segway PT|Segway]], etc.

==Public space in design theory==
Public space, as a term and as a concept in design, is volatile. There is much conversation around what constitutes public space, what role it plays, and how design should approach and deal with it.

===Historical shift===
Historically, public space in the west has been limited to town centres, plazas, church squares, i.e. nearly always engineered around a central monument, which informs the program of the space. These spaces acted as the '[[common land|commons]]' of the people; a political, social and cultural arena. Of the thirteen colonies that became the United States, three were comprehensively planned with integrated physical, social, and economic elements. These planned colonies of Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Georgia each placed emphasis on public space, in particular the public square. The plan for Georgia, known as the [[Oglethorpe Plan]] created a unique design in which a public square was created for every ward of forty residential lots and four civic or commercial lots. The design has been preserved in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah historic district]].&lt;ref&gt;Fries, Sylvia. ''The Urban Idea in Colonial America''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1977. Chapters 3 and 5 discuss the designs of Pennsylvania and Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan''. Charlottesville, VA: University of Virginia Press, 2012. See chapter 3 for design details.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rivers, William J. ''A Sketch of the History of South Carolina''. Charleston: McCarter and Co., 1856. See pp. 358-394 for design details; Carolina thus far has received less attention in the urban design literature than Pennsylvania or Georgia&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jürgen Habermas]]' concept of the [[public sphere]] links its emergence with the development of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Habermas, ''The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society'' (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the [[New Deal]] projects. The New Deal was a brief period in the US under Franklin Delano Roosevelt's government that produced a huge number of public works in an economic effort to boost employment during the depression. The result, however, was more than this. They constituted a legacy of what has been called the cultural infrastructure underlying American public space.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. Leighninger, Jr., 1996, 'Cultural Infrastructure: The Legacy of New Deal Public Space', ''Journal of Architectural Education'', Vol. 49, No. 4 (May, 1996), pp. 226-236&lt;/ref&gt; The New Deal projects have been credited with significantly contributing to the quality of American life and encouraging unity between all aspects of the community. It has been recently argued, however, that the democratic ideal of public life through the use of public space has deteriorated. As our cities accelerate towards segregation (social, economic, cultural, ethnic), the opportunity for public interaction is on the decline. John Chase writes, "The importance of voluntary and obligatory participation in civic life has been usurped by the consciousness of the arbitrary nature of assigned cultural meanings and by the increasingly important role that consumption of goods and services plays in the formation of individual identity."&lt;ref&gt;John Chase, "The Garret, the Boardroom, and the Amusement Park," JAE 47/2 (Nov. 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern critique===
Modern architectural critics have lamented on the 'narrative of loss' within the public sphere. That is, modern society has withdrawn from public life that used to inform city centres. Political and social needs, and forums for expression, can now be accessed from the home. This sentiment is reflected in Michael Sorkin's and Mike Davis' declaration of "the end of public space" and the "destruction of any truly democratic urban spaces."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Sorkin, "Introduction", and Mike Davis, "Fortress Los Angeles: The Militarization of Urban Space," in Michael Sorkin, ed. Variations on a Theme Park: The New American City and the End of Public Space (New York: Hill and Wang, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  Another side of the debate, however, argues that it is people who apply meaning to public space, wherever it may be. It has been suggested that the concepts of public, space, democracy, and citizenship are being redefined by people through lived experience.&lt;ref name="MargaretCrawford"&gt;Margaret Crawford. 1995, "Contesting the Public Realm: Struggles over Public Space in Los Angeles", Journal of Architectural Education, Vol. 49, No. 1 (Sep, 1995) pp. 4-9&lt;/ref&gt; Discussion has surfaced around the idea that, historically, public space has been inherently contradictory in the way that it has always been exclusive in who has been able to participate. This has caused the "counterpublics", as identified by Nancy Fraser,&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Fraser, "Rethinking the Public Sphere: A Contribution to the Critique of Actually Existing Democracy," in Bruce Robbins, ed., The Phantom Public Sphere (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; to establish their own public spaces to respond to their own concerns.  These spaces are in constant flux, and in response, its users restructure and reinterpret physical space. An example of this is in the African-American neighbourhood, [[Baldwin Hills, Los Angeles]]. Here, a parking lot has evolved into a scene of intense commercial and social activity. Locals gather here to meet and socialise, sell and consume goods. The example has been used to illustrate that the historical ideal of fixed public space around a monument is not viable for a contemporary diverse social range as "no single physical space can represent a completely inclusive 'space of democracy'."&lt;ref name="MargaretCrawford" /&gt;

===Art in public space===
[[File:CESENA-3497.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Piazza del Popolo, Cesena|Piazza del Popolo]] in [[Cesena]] with the artistic ''Fontana Masini'']]
[[File:Projections of fire and text onto the National Theatre London by Public Artist Martin Firrell.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Martin Firrell]] The [[Royal National Theatre]] [[London]] 2016]]
{{Main|Public art}}
This sense of flux and change, informs how contemporary public art has evolved. Temporal art in public spaces has been a long established practice. But the presence of public art has become increasingly prevalent and important within our contemporary cities. Temporal public art is so important because of its ability to respond to, reflect, and explore the context which it inhabits.  Patricia Phillips describes the "social desire for an art that is contemporary and timely, that responds to and reflects its temporal and circumstantial context."&lt;ref&gt;Patricie C. Philips, 1989, "Temporality and Public Art", Art Journal, Vol. 48, No. 4, Critical Issues in Public Art (Winter, 1989), pp. 331-335&lt;/ref&gt; Public art is an arena for investigation, exploration and articulation of the dense and diverse public landscape. Public art asks its audience to re-imagine, re-experience, re-view and re-live. In the design field, a heavy focus has been turned onto the city as needing to discover new and inspired ways to re-use, re-establish and re-invent the city, in step with an invigorated interest in re-juvinating our cities for a sustainable future. Contemporary design has become obsessed with the need to save the modern city from an industrialised, commercialised, urban pit of a death bed.

===Approaching urban design===
Contemporary perception of public space has now branched and grown into a multitude of non-traditional sites with a variety of programs in mind. It is for this reason that the way in which design deals with public space as a discipline, has become such a diverse and indefinable field.

Iris Aravot puts forward an interesting approach to the urban design process, with the idea of the 'narrative-myth'. Aravot argues that "conventional analysis and problem solving methods result in fragmentation...of the authentic experience of a city...[and] something of the liveliness of the city as a singular entity is lost."&lt;ref&gt;Iris Aravot, "Narrative-Myth and Urban Design", Journal of Architectural Education (1984-), Vol. 49, No. 2 (Nov., 1995), pp. 79-91&lt;/ref&gt; The process of developing a narrative-myth in urban design involves analysing and understanding the unique aspects of the local culture based on Cassirer's five distinctive "symbolic forms".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Cassirer, An Essay on Man (New York: Bantam, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; They are myth and religion, art, language, history and science; aspects often disregarded by professional practice. Aravot suggests that the narrative-myth "imposes meaning specifically on what is still inexplicable", i.e. the essence of a city.

'''St. Joseph's Technical Institute''' is a [[Pakistan]]i [[vocational school]] for motor mechanics, welders and electricians in [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]].

==History and operations==
The institute to train school dropouts was the dream of Father Clement Sethupathy, a Sri Lankan [[missionary]] in Pakistan, since 1965. In 1985, he initiated a project that would make technical skills training available to them.

Feasibility studies were done, plans made, and funding agencies contacted over several years. In August 1990, [[Misereor]], the German Catholic bishops' development aid agency, agreed to finance the entire project.

Its first batch of motor mechanics, welders and electricians graduated in 1993, after a single year of operation.  The 27 graduates participating in the first commencement ceremonies on October 22, 1993, were addressed by Father Bashir Francis, vicar general of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Faisalabad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =UCANews.com December 3, 1993| url= http://www.ucanews.com/1993/12/03/churchrun-technical-school-produces-first-fruits/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, there were 45 young men learning and honing their skills in auto mechanics, electrical mechanics, plumbing and welding at the school, which has facilities to train 75 students at a time.

===Admission===
To qualify, a youth must be 15 to 24 years of age and must have completed eighth grade in school.

===Facilities===
The institute comprises the technical school and a residential Boys' Town. These are complementary and interdependent, both aiming to help young Christian men find more and better opportunities in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =UCANews.com June 11, 1997| url= http://www.ucanews.com/1997/06/11/faisalabad-diocese-runs-technical-school-for-dropouts/?key=technical+institute+faisalabad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spread over three hectares in the suburbs of Faisalabad, the institute houses boarders as well as enrolling day students for technical courses.

===Administration===
In 2003, the [[Marist Brothers]] took over the management of the institute. On September 11, 2006, the Marist Brothers celebrated their forty-year presence in Pakistan with a thanksgiving Mass at the institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =Forty years of Marist life in Pakistan 19/10/2006 | url=http://www.champagnat.org/pt/261000001.asp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the Finnish and Swedish internship (work experience) programs for middle school students||Tet (disambiguation){{!}}Tet}}

'''TET'''/'''PRAO''' (''Työelämään tutustuminen'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''Praktisk arbetslivsorientering'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], lit. ''familiarization with working life'') is a program providing one to three weeks of experience working in a real job during [[middle school]] (lower secondary education) in [[Finland]] and [[Sweden]].

The program is one to three weeks long and takes place in 7th, 8th or 9th grade, depending on the school. Each student can choose and apply to their job independently and has to sign a contract with both the school and the employer. Often students end up working with a relative or friend.

Students working in the program are normally entitled to one free meal per day, but they receive no salary or allowance. Costs incurred by the employer are paid by the Finnish/Swedish state.

The purpose of the program is to introduce students to real-life working environments. TET students normally have a six-hour workday, with only one mandatory 30-minute lunch break. Rules require that no heavy lifting (over 15&amp;nbsp;kg) be part of normal labour, and there are other specifications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4682">'''''The Baird Lecture''''' is a lectureship that was endowed by [[James Baird (industrialist)|James Baird]] to promote the Christian religion.

==History and endowment==
In 1873 [[James Baird (industrialist)|James Baird]] established The Baird Trust and gave into its care £500,000 to be used for aggressive Christian work. A part of the income of this fund was to provide for a series of lectures in [[Glasgow]] and also, if required, at one other of the Scottish university towns. Each course was to be delivered by a minister of the [[Church of Scotland]], who could be reappointed, and was to consist of at least six lectures.

The '''University of Rhode Island''', commonly referred to as '''URI''', is the flagship public research as well as the [[Land-grant university|land grant]] and [[National Sea Grant College Program|sea grant]] university for the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Rhode Island]]. Its main campus is located in the village of [[Kingston, Rhode Island|Kingston]] in southern Rhode Island. Additionally, smaller campuses include the Feinstein Campus in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], the Rhode Island Nursing Education Center in Providence, the Narragansett Bay Campus in [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]], and the W. Alton Jones Campus in [[West Greenwich, Rhode Island|West Greenwich]].

The university offers [[bachelor's degrees]], [[master's degrees]], and [[doctoral degrees]] in 80 undergraduate and 49 graduate areas of study through eight academic colleges. These colleges include Arts and Sciences, Business, Education and Professional Studies, Engineering, Health Sciences, Environment and Life Sciences, Nursing, and Pharmacy. Another college, University College for Academic Success, serves primarily as an advising college for all incoming undergraduates and follows them through their first two years of enrollment at URI.

The University enrolled about 13,600 undergraduate and 3,000 graduate students in Fall 2015.&lt;ref name=Enrollment/&gt; ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' classifies URI as a tier 1 national university, ranking it tied for 161st in the U.S.&lt;ref name=USNWR&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-rhode-island-3414 |title=U.S. News Best Colleges Rankings – University of Rhode Island |publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The university was first chartered as the state's agricultural school and [[agricultural experiment station]] in 1888. The site of the school was originally the Oliver Watson Farm, whose original farmhouse is now a small museum. In 1892, the school became known as the '''Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://smithlever.wvu.edu/r/download/199832 |title=Philosophical &amp; Institutional Innovations of Kenyon Leech Butterfield and the Rhode Island Contributions to the Development of Land Grant and Sea Grant Extension |author= Rice, M.A., S.

In 1909, the school's name was again changed to '''Rhode Island State College''' as the school's programs were expanded beyond its original agricultural education mandate. In 1951 the school was given its current title through an act of the General Assembly following the addition of the College of Arts and Sciences and the offering of doctoral degrees. The Board of Governors for Higher Education, appointed by the governor, became the governing body of the University in 1981 during the presidency of [[Frank Newman (educator)|Frank Newman]] (1974–1983). The Board of Governors was replaced by the Rhode Island Board of Education in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=New RI Board of Ed meets for first time|url=http://www.wpri.com/news/local/providence/providence-new-ri-board-of-ed-meets-for-first-time|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130818041102/http://www.wpri.com/news/local/providence/providence-new-ri-board-of-ed-meets-for-first-time|dead-url=yes|archive-date=August 18, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2013|date=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current president is David M.

==Main campus==
URI's main campus is located in northern [[South Kingstown, Rhode Island|South Kingstown]], and is accessed via [[Rhode Island Route 138]] from either the west ([[Interstate 95]]) or east ([[United States Route 1]]).  The campus was mostly farmland when it was purchased by the state in 1888, and still includes the c. 1796 Oliver Watson Farmhouse.  The early buildings of the campus are set around its main quadrangle, and were built out of locally quarried granite.  The campus master plan was developed by the noted landscape architects [[Olmsted, Olmsted &amp; Eliot]] in the 1890s.  The central portion of the campus, where most of its pre-1950 buildings are located,&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/sk_uri.pdf|title=Draft NRHP nomination for University of Rhode Island Historic District|publisher=Rhode Island Preservation|accessdate=November 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116031505/http://www.preservation.ri.gov/pdfs_zips_downloads/national_pdfs/sk_uri.pdf|archive-date=November 16, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2017.

'''Virtual reality''' ('''VR''') is an interactive [[Computer generated reality|computer-generated]] experience taking place within a simulated environment. It incorporates mainly auditory and visual feedback, but may also allow other types of [[Perception#Types|sensory feedback]] like [[Haptic perception|haptic]]. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical. [[Augmented reality]] systems may also be considered a form of VR that layers virtual information over a live camera feed into a headset or through a [[smartphone]] or tablet device giving the user the ability to view three-dimensional images.

Current VR technology most commonly uses [[virtual reality headset]]s or multi-projected environments, sometimes in combination with physical environments or props, to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual or imaginary environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to "look around" the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a [[head-mounted display]] with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens.

VR systems that include transmission of vibrations and other sensations to the user through a [[game controller]] or other devices are known as [[haptic technology|haptic]] systems. This tactile information is generally known as [[force feedback]] in medical, [[video gaming]], and military training applications.

==Etymology and terminology==
[[File:Linux kernel and gaming input-output latency.svg|thumb|Paramount for the sensation of [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersion]] into virtual reality are a high [[frame rate]] (at least 95 fps), as well as a low [[latency (engineering)|latency]].]]

"[[Virtual (philosophy)|Virtual]]" has had the meaning of "being something in essence or effect, though not actually or in fact" since the mid-1400s.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=virtual|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "virtual" has been used in the computer sense of "not physically existing but made to appear by software" since 1959.&lt;ref name="etymonline.com"/&gt; 
In 1938, the French avant-garde playwright  [[Antonin Artaud]] described the illusory nature of characters and objects in the [[theatre]] as [[:fr:Réalité virtuelle|"la réalité virtuelle"]] in a collection of essays, ''[[:fr:Le Théâtre et son double|Le Théâtre et son double]]''. The English translation of this book, published in 1958 as ''[[The Theater and its Double]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonin Artaud]], ''The Theatre and its Double'' Trans. Mary Caroline Richards. (New York: Grove Weidenfeld, 1958).&lt;/ref&gt; is the earliest published use of the term "virtual reality". The term "[[artificial reality]]", coined by [[Myron W. Krueger|Myron Krueger]], has been in use since the 1970s. The term "virtual reality" was first used in a science fiction context in ''The Judas Mandala'', a 1982 novel by [[Damien Broderick]].

A "[[cyberspace]]" is a networked virtual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/cyberspace|title=the definition of cyberspace|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual reality shares some elements with "[[augmented reality]]" (or AR).&lt;ref&gt;Myron Krueger. Artificial Reality 2, Addison-Wesley Professional, 1991. {{ISBN|0-201-52260-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; AR is a type of virtual reality technology that blends what the user sees in their ''real'' surroundings with digital content generated by computer software. The additional software-generated images with the virtual scene typically enhance how the real surroundings look in some way. Some AR systems use a camera to capture the user's surroundings or some type of display screen which the user looks at (e.g., Microsoft's [[HoloLens]], [[Magic Leap]]).

==Technology==
The [[VRML|Virtual Reality Modelling Language]] (VRML), first introduced in 1994, was intended for the development of "virtual worlds" without dependency on headsets.&lt;ref name="W3 VRML archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=VRML Virtual Reality Modeling Language|url=https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/VRML/|website=www.w3.org|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Web3D]] consortium was subsequently founded in 1997 for the development of industry standards for web-based 3D graphics. The consortium subsequently developed [[X3D]] from the VRML framework as an archival, [[open source software|open-source]] standard for web-based distribution of VR content.&lt;ref name="W3D Brutzman 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brutzman|first1=Don|title=X3D Graphics and VR|url=http://www.web3d.org/sites/default/files/presentations/X3D%20Graphics%20and%20VR/X3dGraphicsVirtualRealityW3cWorkshop2016October18.pdf|website=web3D.org|publisher=Web3D Consortium|accessdate=20 March 2017|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All modern VR displays are based on technology developed for [[smartphone]]s including: [[gyroscope]]s and motion sensors for tracking head, hand, and body positions; small HD screens for [[stereoscopic]] displays; and small, lightweight and fast [[processors]]. These components led to relative affordability for independent VR developers, and lead to the 2012 Oculus Rift Kickstarter offering the first independently developed VR headset.&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

Independent production of VR images and video has increased by the development of [[omnidirectional camera]]s, also known as 360-degree cameras or [[VR photography|VR cameras]], that have the ability to record in all directions, although at low-resolutions or in highly compressed formats for online streaming of [[360 video]].&lt;ref name="CNET May 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Orellana|first1=Vanessa Hand|title=10 things I wish I knew before shooting 360 video|url=https://www.cnet.com/how-to/360-cameras-comparison-video-things-to-know-before-you-buy/|website=CNET|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[photogrammetry]] is increasingly used to combine several high-resolution photographs for the creation of detailed 3D objects and environments in VR applications.&lt;ref name="RE7 80.lv"&gt;{{cite web|title=Resident Evil 7: The Use of Photogrammetry for VR|url=https://80.lv/articles/resident-evil-7-the-use-of-photogrammetry-for-vr/|website=80.lv|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="otherboard March 2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Leif|title=Forget 360 Videos, Photogrammetric Virtual Reality Is Where It's At - Motherboard|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/forget-360-videos-photogrammetric-virtual-reality-is-where-its-at|website=Motherboard|accessdate=20 March 2017|language=en-us|date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:View-Master with Reel.jpg|thumb|[[View-Master]], a stereoscopic visual simulator, was introduced in 1939]]

The exact origins of virtual reality are disputed, partly because of how difficult it has been to formulate a definition for the concept of an alternative existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theverge.com/a/virtual-reality/intro | title=Seeing is Believing: The State of Virtual Reality | author=Matthew Schnipper | publisher= The Verge | access-date= 7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of perspective in Renaissance Europe created convincing depictions of spaces that did not exist, in what has been referred to as the "multiplying of artificial worlds".&lt;ref name="Baltrušaitis 1977"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baltrušaitis |first1=Jurgis |last2=Strachan |first2=W.J. |title=Anamorphic art |date=1977 |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |isbn=9780810906624 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other elements of virtual reality appeared as early as the 1860s. Antonin Artaud took the view that illusion was not distinct from reality, advocating that spectators at a play should suspend disbelief and regard the drama on stage as reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vrs.org.uk/virtual-reality/beginning.html | title=How did virtual reality begin? | publisher=Virtual Reality Society | access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first references to the more modern concept of virtual reality came from [[science fiction]].

=== 1950–1970 ===
[[File:Sensorama-morton-heilig-virtual-reality-headset.jpg|upright|thumb|left|The [[Sensorama]] was designed in the 1960s]]

[[Morton Heilig]] wrote in the 1950s of an "Experience Theatre" that could encompass all the senses in an effective manner, thus drawing the viewer into the onscreen activity. He built a prototype of his vision dubbed the [[Sensorama]] in 1962, along with five short films to be displayed in it while engaging multiple senses (sight, sound, smell, and touch). Predating digital computing, the Sensorama was a [[Machine|mechanical device]]. Heilig also developed what he referred to as the "Telesphere Mask" (patented in 1960). The patent application described the device as "a telescopic television apparatus for individual use...The spectator is given a complete sensation of reality, i.e. moving three dimensional images which may be in colour, with 100% peripheral vision, binaural sound, scents and air breezes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.techradar.com/news/wearables/forgotten-genius-the-man-who-made-a-working-vr-machine-in-1957-1318253/2 | title=Forgotten genius: the man who made a working VR machine in 1957 | author=Holly Brockwell | date=3 April 2016 | publisher=Tech Radar | access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, [[Douglas Engelbart]] used computer screens both as input and output devices. In 1968, [[Ivan Sutherland]], with the help of his student [[Bob Sproull]], created what was widely considered to be the first [[head-mounted display]] (HMD) system for use in immersive simulation applications. It was primitive both in terms of [[user interface]] and [[realism (arts)|realism]], and the HMD to be worn by the user was so heavy that it had to be suspended from the ceiling. The graphics comprising the virtual environment were simple [[wire-frame model]] rooms. The formidable appearance of the device inspired its name, [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|The Sword of Damocles]].

=== 1970–1990 ===
The VR industry mainly provided VR devices for medical, flight simulation, automobile industry design, and military training purposes from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|title=National Center for Supercomputing Applications: History|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821054144/http://archive.ncsa.illinois.edu/Cyberia/VETopLevels/VR.History.html|archivedate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Em became the first artist to produce navigable virtual worlds at [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), where he was Artist in Residence from 1977 to 1984.&lt;ref name="Creative Computing March 1982"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nelson|first1=Ted|title=Report on Siggraph '81|journal=Creative Computing|date=March 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aspen Movie Map]] was created at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1978. The program was a crude virtual simulation of [[Aspen, Colorado]] in which users could wander the streets in one of the three modes: summer, winter, and polygons. 

In 1979 [[Eric Howlett]] developed the Large Expanse, Extra Perspective (LEEP) optical system. The combined system created a stereoscopic image with a field of view wide enough to create a convincing sense of space. The users of the system have been impressed by the sensation of depth [field of view] in the scene and the corresponding realism. The original LEEP system was redesigned for the NASA Ames Research Center in 1985 for their first virtual reality installation, the VIEW (Virtual Interactive Environment Workstation) by [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]]. The LEEP system provides the basis for most of the current virtual reality helmets available today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Wayne|title="Virtual Reality and Artificial Environments", A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation|date=December 2005|location=Section 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Musée Mécanique 205.JPG|thumb|upright|A 1980 Atari arcade video game ''[[Battlezone (1980 video game)|Battlezone]]'' used 3D vector graphics to immerse the player in a VR world]]

[[Atari]] founded a research lab for virtual reality in 1982, but the lab was closed after two years due to the Atari Shock ([[North American video game crash of 1983]]). However, its hired employees, such as Tom Zimmerman, [[Scott Fisher (technologist)|Scott Fisher]], [[Jaron Lanier]], [[Michael Naimark]], and [[Brenda Laurel]], kept their research and development on VR-related technologies. 

[[File:VPL DataSuit 1.jpg|upright|thumb|left|A VPL Research DataSuit, a full-body outfit with sensors for measuring the movement of arms, legs, and trunk. Developed circa 1989. Displayed at the Nissho Iwai showroom in Tokyo]]

By the 1980s the term "virtual reality" was popularized by Jaron Lanier, one of the modern pioneers of the field. Lanier had founded the company [[VPL Research]] in 1985. VPL Research has developed several VR devices like the Data Glove, the EyePhone, and the Audio Sphere. VPL licensed the Data Glove technology to [[Mattel]], which used it to make an accessory known as the Power Glove. While the Power Glove was hard to use and not popular, at US$75, it was an early affordable VR device.

=== 1990–2000 ===
In 1991, [[Carolina Cruz-Neira]], [[Daniel J. Sandin]] and [[Thomas A. DeFanti]] from the [[Electronic Visualization Laboratory]] created the [[Cave automatic virtual environment|first cubic immersive room]], The Cave. Developed as Cruz-Neira's PhD thesis, it involved a multi-projected environment, similar to the [[holodeck]], allowing people to see their own bodies in relation to others in the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goad|first1=Angela|title=Carolina Cruz-Neira {{!}} Introductions Necessary|url=http://introductionsnecessary.com/2016/01/18/carolina-cruz-neira/|website=Introductions Necessary|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arkansas Online Niera"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=David|title=Engineer envisions sci-fi as reality|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2014/nov/24/engineer-envisions-sci-fi-as-reality-20/?print|accessdate=28 March 2017|work=Arkansas Online|date=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1989-1992, [[Nicole Stenger]] created ''Angels'', the first real-time interactive immersive movie. The interaction was facilitated with a [[dataglove]] and high-resolution goggles.

In 1992, [[Louis Rosenberg (entrepreneur)|Louis Rosenberg]] created the [[Virtual fixture|Virtual Fixtures]] system at the [[Armstrong Laboratory|U.S. Air Force’s Armstrong Labs]] using a [[:File:Virtual-Fixtures-USAF-AR.jpg|full upper-body exoskeleton]], enabling a physically realistic virtual reality in 3D.  The system enabled the overlay of physically real 3D virtual objects registered with a user's direct view of the real world, producing the first true [[augmented reality]] experience enabling sight, sound, and touch.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1992"&gt;Rosenberg, Louis (1992).

In 1999, entrepreneur [[Philip Rosedale]] formed [[Linden Lab]] with an initial focus on the development of VR hardware. In its earliest form, the company struggled to produce a commercial version of "The Rig", which was realized in prototype form as a clunky steel contraption with several computer monitors that users could wear on their shoulders. The concept was later adapted into the personal computer-based, 3D virtual world [[Second Life]].&lt;ref&gt;Au, Wagner James. ''The Making of Second Life'', pg. 19.

In 2001, SAS Cube (SAS3) became the first PC based cubic room, developed by Z-A Production ([[Maurice Benayoun]], David Nahon), Barco, and Clarté. It was installed in [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]], France. The SAS library gave birth to Virtools VRPack. 

By 2007, [[Google]] introduced [[Google Street View|Street View]], a service that shows panoramic views of an increasing number of worldwide positions such as roads, indoor buildings and rural areas. It also features a stereoscopic 3D mode, introduced in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://readwrite.com/2010/04/06/google_street_view_in_3d_here_to_stay |title=Google Street View in 3D: More Than Just an April Fool's Joke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Palmer Luckey]] designed the first prototype of the [[Oculus Rift]]. This prototype, built on a shell of another virtual reality headset, was only capable of rotational tracking. However, it boasted a 90-degree field of vision that was previously unseen in the consumer market at the time.

In [[robotics]], virtual reality has been used to control robots in [[telepresence]] and [[telerobotic]] systems.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg 1993"&gt;Rosenberg, L., "Virtual fixtures as tools to enhance operator performance in telepresence environments," SPIE Manipulator Technology, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is useful in robotics development such as in experiments that investigate how robots—through virtual articulations—can be applied as an intuitive [[User interface|human interface]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Robotics and Virtual Reality|last=Gulrez|first=Tauseef|last2=Hassanien|first2=Aboul Ella|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=2012|isbn=9783642233623|location=Berlin|pages=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, researchers can simulate how robots are remotely controlled in different environments such as in space. Here, virtual reality not only offers insights into the manipulation and [[Locomotion in space|locomotion]] of robotic technology but also shows opportunities for inspection.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

VR has also been used in research of the behavior of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A study was conducted in which a two-dimensional avatar was used to compare the degree of mimicry in neurotypical and ASD participants. The study showed the potential for VR to promote mimicry and revealed the difference between neurotypical and ASD individuals in their response to a two-dimensional avatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Forbes |first1=Paul A.

Applications for VR are facilitated by technologies that go beyond the use of graphics and [[Virtual reality headset|headsets]]. There are a multitude of techniques, technologies, and hardware solutions to enhance the immersive experience and derive data from the users’ responses to that experience. The use of haptic clothing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://teslasuit.io/|title=Teslasuit - full body haptic suit|website=Teslasuit - full body haptic VR suit|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, eye tracking technologies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tobiipro.com/|title=Eye tracking technology for research - Tobii Pro|date=2015-04-27|website=www.tobiipro.com|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and “Fourth Dimension” sensory stimulation are becoming especially popular and useful&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mxtreality.co.uk/help/|title=Help - MXT|website=mxtreality.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== In fiction and popular culture ==
{{Main|Virtual reality in fiction}}

There have been many works of fiction that reference and describe forms of virtual reality. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, [[cyberpunk]]s viewed the technology as a potential means for social change. The [[recreational drug]] subculture praised virtual reality not only as a new art form, but as an entirely new frontier.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultronix.eserver.org/chesher/|title=Colonizing Virtual Reality: Construction of the Discourse of Virtual Reality|last=Chesher|first=Chris|date=1994|website=|publisher=Cultronix|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304125850/http://cultronix.eserver.org/chesher/|archive-date=2016-03-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concerns and challenges ==
===Health and safety===
There are many health and safety considerations of virtual reality. Most virtual reality systems come with consumer warnings, including: seizures; developmental issues in children; trip-and-fall and collision warnings; discomfort; repetitive stress injury; and interference with medical devices.&lt;ref name="Oculus Rift Warnings"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oculus Rift Health and Safety Notice|url=https://static.oculus.com/documents/310-30023-01_Rift_HealthSafety_English.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some users may experience twitches, seizures or blackouts while using VR headsets, even if they do not have a history of epilepsy and have never had blackouts or seizures before. As many as one in 4000 people may experience these symptoms. Since these symptoms are more common among people under the age of 20, children are advised against using VR headsets. Other problems may occur in physical interactions with one's environment. While wearing VR headsets, people quickly lose awareness of their real-world surroundings and may injure themselves by tripping over, or colliding with real-world objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Fagan |first1=Kaylee |title=Here's what happens to your body when you've been in virtual reality for too long |url=https://www.businessinsider.com/virtual-reality-vr-side-effects-2018-3 |accessdate=5 September 2018 |publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of unwanted symptoms have been caused by prolonged use of virtual reality,&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, B. D. (2014). Motion sickness symptomatology and origins. Handbook of Virtual Environments: Design, Implementation, and Applications, 531-599.&lt;/ref&gt; and these may have slowed proliferation of the technology. For example, in 1995, Nintendo released a gaming console known as the [[Virtual Boy]]. Worn as a headpiece and connected to a typical controller, the Virtual Boy received much criticism for its negative physical effects, including "dizziness, nausea, and headaches".&lt;ref&gt;Frischling, Bill. "Sideline Play." The Washington Post (1974-Current file): 11. ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Washington Post (1877-1995). October 25, 1995. Web. May 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; VR headsets may regularly cause eye fatigue, as does all screened technology, because people tend to blink less when watching screens, causing their eyes to become more dried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Mukamal |first1=Reena |title=Are Virtual Reality Headsets Safe for Eyes? |url=https://www.aao.org/eye-health/tips-prevention/are-virtual-reality-headsets-safe-eyes |website=American Academy of Ophthalmology |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been some concerns about VR headsets contributing to myopia, but although VR headsets sit close to the eyes, they may not necessarily contribute to nearsightedness if the focal length of the image being displayed is sufficiently far away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Langley |first1=Hugh |title=We need to look more carefully into the long-term effects of VR |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-long-term-brain-eyes-effects-6674 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virtual reality sickness]] (also known as cybersickness) occurs when a person's exposure to a virtual environment causes symptoms that are similar to [[motion sickness]] symptoms.&lt;ref name="Kiryu2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kiryu |first1=T |last2=So |first2=RH |title=Sensation of presence and cybersickness in applications of virtual reality for advanced rehabilitation |journal=Journal of Neuroengineering and Rehabilitation |date=25 September 2007 |volume=4 |pages=34 |doi=10.1186/1743-0003-4-34 |pmid=17894857 |pmc=2117018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common symptoms are general discomfort, headache, stomach awareness, nausea, vomiting, pallor, sweating, fatigue, drowsiness, disorientation, and apathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hicks |first1=Jamison S. |last2=Durbin |first2=David B. |title=ARL-TR-5573: A Summary of Simulator Sickness Ratings for U.S. Army Aviation Engineering Simulators |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a551763.pdf |publisher=US Army Research Laboratory |date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These motion sickness symptoms are caused by a disconnect between what is being seen and what the rest of the body perceives. When the vestibular system, the body's internal balancing system, does not experience the motion that it expects from visual input through the eyes, the user may experience VR sickness. This can also happen if the VR system does not have a high enough frame rate, or if there is a lag between the body's movement and the onscreen visual reaction to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Caddy |first1=Becca |title=Vomit Reality: Why VR makes some of us feel sick and how to make it stop |url=https://www.wareable.com/vr/vr-headset-motion-sickness-solution-777 |website=Wareable.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because approximately 25–40% of people experience some kind of VR sickness when using VR machines, companies are actively looking for ways to reduce VR sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Samit |first1=Jay |title=A Possible Cure for Virtual Reality Motion Sickness |url=http://fortune.com/2018/02/06/virtual-reality-motion-sickness/ |website=Fortune.com |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
The persistent tracking required by all VR systems makes the technology particularly useful for, and vulnerable to, mass [[surveillance]]. The expansion of VR will increase the potential and reduce the costs for information gathering of personal actions, movements and responses.&lt;ref name="Wired Magic Leap Apr2016" /&gt;

===Conceptual and philosophical concerns===
In addition, there are conceptual and philosophical considerations and implications associated with the use of virtual reality. What the phrase "virtual reality" means or refers to can be ambiguous. [[Mychilo S. Cline]] argued in 2005 that through virtual reality techniques will be developed to influence human behavior, [[interpersonal communication]], and [[cognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7OxbJWzIaVEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=power+madness+and+immortality&amp;q=|title=Power, Madness, &amp; Immortality: the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28|author1=Cline, Mychilo Stephenson|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com/index.php?itemid=25&amp;catid=4 |title=The Future of Virtual Reality with Mychilo Cline " Introduction to the Future of Virtual Reality |publisher=Virtualreality.universityvillagepress.com |accessdate=2009-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Power, Madness and Immortality {{!}} KurzweilAI|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/power-madness-and-immortality|website=www.kurzweilai.net|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Citizen Flag.svg|thumb|The flag of the WSA.]]
The '''World Service Authority''' ('''WSA'''), 
founded in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2006/03/whats_a_world_passport.1.html |title= What's a World Passport? |accessdate= 10 June 2015 |last= Engber |first= Daniel |date= 24 March 2006 |publisher= Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a non-profit organization that claims to educate about and promote "world citizenship", "world law", and [[World Government]]. It is best known for selling [[World Passport]]s.

==Organization==
WSA has an office in [[Washington, D.C.]] The office in [[Shanghai]], People's Republic of China, closed on 1 January 2010. {{As of|2017}} attorney David M. Gallup was the president of WSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7dvt.com/2001/passport-fame |title="Passport To Fame", 7 Days Vermont, 28 March 2001 |publisher=7dvt.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.martindale.com/David-M-Gallup/380116-lawyer.htm |title=Martindale.com, David M. Gallup |publisher=Martindale.com |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2017-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The WSA was founded by [[Garry Davis]], a former Broadway actor and [[World War II]] bomber pilot, who officially [[relinquishment of United States nationality|gave up his U.S. citizenship]] in 1948 to live as a "citizen of the world". It was set up to be the administrative agency of the "[[World government|World Government of World Citizens]]" which he declared on 4 September 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldservice.org/gov.html |title=What is the World Government of World Citizens? |publisher=Worldservice.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first office was opened in [[New York City]] in 1954. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldservice.org/gov.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, WSA also had offices in [[Basel]], [[London]] and [[Tokyo]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldservice.org/posipapr.html&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldservice.org/blog/2003/09/50th-anniversary-of-world-citizen.html|title=World Citizen Update: 50th Anniversary of the World Citizen Government|website=www.worldservice.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Besides selling World Passports,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/us/garry-davis-man-of-no-nation-dies-at-91.html|title=Garry Davis, Man of No Nation Who Saw One World of No War, Dies at 91|last=Fox|first=Margalit|date=2013-07-28|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-04-05|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; the WSA registers customers as "world citizens" and sells "world citizen" identity documents, such as fantasy birth certificates, identity cards, marriage certificates, political asylum cards, "International Exit Visas" and "International Residence Permits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldservice.org/doc.html |title=World Government Documents (Personal) |publisher=Worldservice.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's legal department is responsible to assist holders of its documents.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldservice.org/wsaljudc.html&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization also promotes programs, such as "Mundialization" – declaring cities and towns as "world territories"; "World Syntegrity Project" – an attempt to create a world constitution through meetings of citizens; and other programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://worldservice.org/programs.html?s=2&lt;/ref&gt;
WSA is also involved in a project to establish a World Court of Human Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcourtofhumanrights.net/home|title=World Court of Human Rights Development Project|website=www.worldcourtofhumanrights.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnx3b3JsZGNvdXJ0b2ZodW1hbnJpZ2h0c3xneDo0N2M3NzMzOWRkNzI5OTUy|title=WCHR Tri-fold.pdf|website=docs.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WSA has also allegedly sold World Government Postal Stamps,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldservice.org/cat.html?s=4#stamps |title=World Service Authority catalog |publisher=Worldservice.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which, according to Garry Davis, helped to convey thousands of letters between China and [[Taiwan]] in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name="onefilms2001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onefilms.com/garry-davis-herald-tribune-quixotic-quest-article.php|title=International Herald Tribune|author=|date=5 December 2001|publisher=Onefilms.com|accessdate=2013-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yenka''' is a suite of educational software products which lets students simulate scientific experiments, create mathematical models, design electronic circuits or learn computer programming. Yenka is developed by Crocodile Clips Ltd.

== Features ==
Yenka uses a unified interface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schoolzone.co.uk/evaluations/contentdesign.asp?evalID=4970|title=Schoolzone evaluation of Yenka 3D Shapes - content and design|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to model reactions in scientific and technological subject areas, often in 3D. Users see results in real time or simulated time at 0.1x or 10x speed, replicating actual results (a completed circuit will illuminate a [[light-emitting diode]] (LED), but applying too much [[electric current]] will destroy it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceman.com/pgs/reviews.php |accessdate=May 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410064110/http://scienceman.com/pgs/reviews.php |archivedate=April 10, 2009 |title=ScienceMan Review - Yenka}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teem.org.uk/2332/content3372.html ]{{dead link|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yenka also allows educators to design lessons and interactive content for students. The extension is .yka.

== Products ==
Yenka is divided into four main groupings: science, computing, mathematics and technology. The products include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yenka.com|title=Yenka.com|publisher=|accessdate=20 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
