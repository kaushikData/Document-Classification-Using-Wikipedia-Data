==Background==
The victims, twin brothers George and Vincent Chin (16) and their brother Winston (13), were from [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. &lt;ref name="NYDailyNews19960204"&gt;{{citation|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-02-04/news/17995836_1_hotel-pools-ramada-rolling-green-hotel-lifeguards|periodical=New York Daily News|date=1996-02-04|accessdate=2011-09-09|title=Pool Of Misery For Kin Of Drowned Teens Tragedy Destroyed Us, Dad Tells Mass. Court|last=O'Shaughnessy|first=Patrice}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were traveling with their uncle Steven Yee, who had paid for the three boys, two of their siblings, and his own three children to join him in a tour group to Boston.&lt;ref name="NYTimes19930409"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe19960131"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8358232.html|periodical=The Boston Globe|date=1996-01-31|accessdate=2011-09-10|last=Rakowsky|first=Judy|title=Drowning victims' parents say hotel too cheap for safety; Pool lacked fence, lifeguard, jury told}}. Also available at [http://www.halstrom.com/html/pdfs/drowning.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drownings==
The tour buses arrived at the Ramada Rolling Green Hotel in Andover just off [[Massachusetts Route 133|Route 133]] at around 9:30 PM. Yee took a shower, while the boys, who did not know how to swim, went to the pool. The pool had a sign posted stating that it closed at 10 PM;&lt;ref name="NYTimes19930409"/&gt; it also stated that no one under 14 was allowed in the pool without adult supervision.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe19960131"/&gt; No [[lifeguard]] was on duty, and [[law of Massachusetts|Massachusetts law]] does not require one at hotel pools.&lt;ref name="NYTimes19930409"/&gt; Nor did the pool have a fence or a ladder in the deep end. Andover town law did not require fences around indoor pools; however, Ramada corporate standards did, the Chin family alleged that state law also required it.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe19960131"/&gt; Their cousin began video-taping them as they played in the pool.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/16318555.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+01%2C+1996&amp;author=Judy+Rakowsky%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Man+tells+of+3+brothers%27+drownings+at+pool&amp;pqatl=google|periodical=Boston Globe|last=Rakowsky|first=Judy|date=1996-02-01|accessdate=2011-09-10|title=Man tells of 3 brothers' drownings at pool}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water was nine feet deep in the deep end.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe19930411"/&gt;

According to police, at one point Vincent and Winston began moving toward the deep end, until the water was above their heads; their siblings thought they were just playing, but when they did not emerge, their siblings began yelling for help and threw them a [[personal flotation device|life preserver]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes19930409"/&gt; George dived into the pool in a rescue attempt, while his cousin went into the hotel to try to find someone to help.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103061200.html?dids=103061200:103061200&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+1993&amp;author=By+Robert+Der.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Remorse+At+Failed+Rescue+Youth%2C+11%2C+saw+3+cousins+drown&amp;pqatl=google|periodical=Newsday|last=Der|first=Robert|date=1993-04-10|accessdate=2011-09-10|title=Remorse At Failed Rescue; Youth, 11, saw 3 cousins drown}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Swimming pool service technician|pool maintenance]] man would later testify that he saw them playing in the pool but did not mention this fact to co-workers or managers. At the time, the night manager and another employee were on the way to the pool to close it, but stopped to chat with the pool maintenance man, delaying their arrival. By the time they came to the pool, they found the boys already submerged.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe19960131"/&gt; The night manager jumped into the pool and pulled them out.&lt;ref name="NYTimes19930409"/&gt; However, the employees lacked [[lifesaving|aquatic rescue skills]] and could not render further assistance.&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe19960131"/&gt;

Vincent was taken to Lawrence General Hospital in the neighboring town of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], while Winston was taken to St. John's Hospital (now [[Saints Medical Center]]) in [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]]; both were declared [[dead on arrival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/68102116.html?dids=68102116:68102116&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+10%2C+1993&amp;author=JASON+B.+JOHNSON&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=Atty.+probes+boys'+deaths+Donors+seek+out+family&amp;pqatl=google|title=Atty. probes boys' deaths; Donors seek out family|last=Johnson|first=Jason B.|date=1993-04-10|accessdate=2011-09-10|periodical=Boston Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; George was still alive when removed from the pool, and was taken by [[air ambulance|helicopter]] to [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in Boston, where he was pronounced dead at 6:18 AM the following morning. The parents flew to Boston that day to identify the bodies and arrange their return to New York.&lt;ref name="NYTimes19930409"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
About 500 mourners attended the boys' funeral, which was held on 13 April at the Wah Wing Sang Buddhist funeral home.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103061187.html?dids=103061187:103061187&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+15%2C+1993&amp;author=By+Sheila+Thomson.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=500+Mourn+3+Brothers+Who+Drowned&amp;pqatl=google|periodical=Newsday|last=Thomson|first=Sheila|date=1993-04-15|accessdate=2011-09-10|title=500 Mourn 3 Brothers Who Drowned}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[David Dinkins]] spoke briefly.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=A8ZEAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hrYMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2260,2755119|periodical=The Albany Herald|date=1993-04-15|accessdate=2011-09-10|title=Friends, family and strangers attend Chin brothers' funeral}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|Brooklyn Chinatown]] branches of the [[Lions Club International|Lions Club]] and [[Kiwanis]], together with the Chinese-American Voters' Association, started a fund to provide aid to the family, as the father was then unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103060623.html?dids=103060623:103060623&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+13%2C+1993&amp;author=By+William+Douglas.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Fund+Started+to+Aid+Drowned+Kids'+Family&amp;pqatl=google|periodical=Newsday|last=Douglas|first=William|title=Fund Started to Aid Drowned Kids' Family|date=1993-04-13|accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramada Rolling Green and its owners offered the Chin family a $1.8 million settlement in January 1996, which they rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-22821032.html|title=Lawsuit blames hotel for drownings|periodical=Buffalo News|date=1996-01-30|accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, they filed a [[wrongful death]] and [[negligence]] suit. They hoped to spark changes in Massachusetts law to require lifeguards at hotel pools, in the way that law in New York City already did.&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews19960204"/&gt; Jury selection was completed on January 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/17253035.html?dids=17253035:17253035&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+30%2C+1996&amp;author=RALPH+RANALLI&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=Jury+set+in+suit+vs.+hotel+where+3+boys+drowned&amp;pqatl=google|title=Jury set in suit vs. hotel where 3 boys drowned|date=1996-01-30|accessdate=2011-09-09|last=Ranalli|first=Ralph|periodical=Boston Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; During deliberations, one member of the jury was dismissed for reading a newspaper article about the case.&lt;ref name="AlbanyHerald19960217"/&gt; The remaining members of the jury failed to reach a verdict.&lt;ref name="OrlandoSentinel19960217"/&gt; On February 16, presiding judge [[Nancy Gertner]] declared a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]].&lt;ref name="AlbanyHerald19960217"&gt;{{citation|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xu9EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LLcMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2735,2916036|periodical=The Albany Herald|date=1996-02-17|accessdate=2011-09-09|title=Mistrial declared in 1993 case of hotel drownings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pornography==
Brady changed his name to "Shaw" when began working in gay pornography in the early 1990s&lt;ref name="CoolBoy"/&gt; and appeared in over 50 films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2009/12/11/aiden-shaw-on-surviving-porn-prostitution/| publisher=Washington Blade| title=Aiden Shaw on surviving porn, prostitution |date=Dec 11, 2009| first=Tyrone| last=Ford| accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retired from the porn industry in 1999. But in 2004, he starred in another gay porn film with [[Hot House Entertainment|Hot House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Perfect Fit (2004) |publisher=IMDB |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455681/| accessdate=7 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Perfect Fit | publisher=Hot House| url=http://www.hothouse.com/en/dvd/Perfect-Fit/7911| accessdate=7 Oct 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing==
In 1991, Shaw collaborated with the New York artist [[Mark Beard (artist)|Mark Beard]] to produce a limited edition publication named ''Aiden''. The book included several portraits of Shaw, with text written by both Beard and Shaw as a form of dialogue.&lt;ref name="Aiden"/&gt;

Shaw published his first novel, ''Brutal'', in 1996. Also in 1996, The Bad Press published a collection of his poems, ''If Language at the Same Time Shapes and Distorts our Ideas and Emotions, How do we Communicate Love?''&lt;ref name=Shaw1996 &gt;{{citation |last=Shaw |first=Aiden |year=1996 |title=If language at the same time shapes and distorts our ideas and emotions, how do we communicate love?|series=Bemis/Flaherty Collection of Gay Poetry |publisher=The Bad Press |oclc=298124621}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote two more novels; ''Boundaries'' (1997) and ''Wasted'' (2001), and an autobiography, ''My Undoing'' (2006) in which he openly discusses his life in the sex industry as a porn star and sex worker, his drug use, and his HIV status (Shaw was diagnosed HIV positive in 1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Sparber |url=http://www.poz.com/articles/1666_9609.shtml |title=The Porn Identity (interview with Aiden Shaw) |publisher=Poz.com |date= September 2006 |accessdate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sam Page |url=http://www.hivplusmag.com/Story.asp?id=2033&amp;categoryid=1 |title=Coming To Terms (interview with Aiden Shaw) |publisher=HIVPLUSMAG.com |date=January 2010 |accessdate=12 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504170034/http://www.hivplusmag.com/Story.asp?ID=2033&amp;categoryid=1 |archivedate=4 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amadeus Arkham''' is a [[fictional character]] in [[DC Comics]]. He was the founder of [[Arkham Asylum]] and is the uncle of [[Jeremiah Arkham]].

==Publication history==
He was created in 1984 for the entry for Arkham Asylum in ''Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe'' #1. The story was retold and expanded in 1989 in ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]''. The graphic novel is interspersed with flashbacks to Arkham founder Amadeus Arkham's life and childhood. The character recently appeared in DC's [[The New 52]] as a [[protagonist]] of ''[[All Star Western]]'' alongside [[Jonah Hex]].

==Fictional character biography==
The ''Who's Who'' entry establishes that the Asylum was named after Elizabeth Arkham, the mother of founder Amadeus Arkham. The original name of the asylum was Arkham Hospital. Its dark history began in the early 1900s when Arkham's mother, having suffered from [[mental illness]] most of her life, committed [[suicide]] (it was later revealed that her son actually [[euthanasia|euthanized]] her and repressed the memory). Amadeus Arkham decided, then, as the sole heir to the Arkham estate, to remodel his family home in order to properly treat the mentally ill, so others might not suffer as his mother had. Prior to the period of the hospital's remodeling, Arkham treated patients at the State Psychiatric Hospital in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], where he, his wife Constance and daughter Harriet had been living for quite some time.

Upon telling his family of his plans, they moved back to his family home to oversee the remodeling. While there, Arkham received a call from the police notifying him that [[serial killer]] [[Mad Dog (DC Comics)|Martin "Mad Dog" Hawkins]] &amp;mdash; referred to Arkham by Metropolis Penitentiary while at State Psychiatric Hospital &amp;mdash; had escaped from prison, and sought his considered opinion on the murderer's state of mind. Shortly afterward, Arkham returned to his home to find his front door wide open. Inside, he discovered the [[rape]]d and mutilated bodies of his wife and daughter in an upstairs room with Hawkins' nickname carved on Harriet's body.

The shock of the murders brings back the memory of killing his mother. For many years, Elizabeth suffered delusions that she was being tormented by a supernatural creature and would call to her son to protect her. One day, however, he finally sees what his mother saw - a great bat, a spectre of death. Taking a pearl-handled straight razor from his pocket, he cuts his mother's throat to end her suffering. He then blocks out the memory and attributes her death to suicide.

Traumatized, Amadeus puts on his mother's wedding dress and takes out the pearl-handled razor. It is vaguely implied that Arkham cannibalizes his family's remains in a shamanic ritual.&lt;ref&gt;''Arkam Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth 15th Anniversary Edition'' ″This was originally a shamanic cannibal sequence, of which only vague hints, suggestions and shadowy threats remain″.&lt;/ref&gt; Kneeling in the blood of his family, he vows to bind the evil spirit of "The Bat," which he believes inhabits the house, through ritual and sorcery. He treats Hawkins for months until finally electrocuting him in a [[Electroconvulsive therapy|shock therapy]] session. This incident is treated as an accident by the authorities. Soon after, Arkham freefalls into madness.  He continues his mission even after he is incarcerated in the Asylum himself after trying to kill his stockbroker in [[Great Depression|1929]]; he scratches the words of a binding spell into the walls and floor of his cell with his fingernails and constantly belts out "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" in a loud voice until the day he dies.
 
Decades later Dr. Cavendish, another doctor in the asylum, believes he is a reincarnation of Amadeus and frees the inmates. Towards the end of the story, he takes another doctor, Dr. Adams, hostage, dresses himself in the dress of Amadeus' mother and relates Arkham's history to Batman before attempting to strangle him. Dr. Adams saves Batman by killing Cavendish with the same razor Amadeus used to kill his mother.

Amadeus' role in creating the asylum, Mad Dog's history with Amadeus and Amadeus' murder of Mad Dog and descent into madness have become canon and are the origin of Arkham Asylum in all incarnations of the asylum since.

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Amadeus Arkham is re-established as having been the partner of the [[bounty hunter]] [[Jonah Hex]]. Amadeus was a psychologist who specializes in criminal behavior and lived in a mansion with his mother. Amadeus often partners up with Jonah Hex in an effort to solve a series of murders that were committed by the Gotham Ripper and even uncovered a child slavery operation run by Thurston Moody of the [[Court of Owls]].&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Western'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Video Games===

* The spirit of Dr. Amadeus Arkham was featured in the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'' voiced by [[Tom Kane]]. The spirit of Arkham is unlocked by scanning several tablets scattered around Arkham, supposedly by Amadeus himself. They retell the story of Amadeus euthanizing his mother, the death of wife and daughter by Mad Dog, Mad Dog's death at the hands of Arkham's guards and finally Amadeus' descent into madness. It is hinted (and later confirmed) that Warden [[Quincy Sharp]], who believes that he is Amadeus reincarnated, is responsible for the messages as evidenced by his attempts to kill [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]], [[Killer Croc]], [[Joker (character)|Joker]] and [[Harley Quinn]] being recorded onto the tablets. While there is no knowledge as to how he attempted to kill them, Sharp mentions his plans to [[Lobotomized|lobotomize]] Harley and attempt to kill Joker in his sleep, which is thwarted by the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]]. If Batman scans all the tablets and comes back to the security office where he left Quincy Sharp, he will find in his place a final message telling Batman to continue his work. Amadeus' cell can also be found in the game, the entirety of its walls and floor covered with binding circles as in ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth]]''.
* In the video game ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', it is revealed that Sharp's delusions of being Arkham's reincarnation were the result of drugs and hypnotherapy delivered by [[Hugo Strange|Dr. Hugo Strange]] with the help of [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]]. Scanning items related to certain inmates reveal that Sharp had treated the inmates abusively, notably by locking Mad Hatter in the physically lowest cell in the Asylum with the clear intent of him never getting out (whether he meant to kill him is unclear) and again trying to murder Poison Ivy by locking her in a cell and letting her die of her Titan overdose caused by the Joker, only for a priest covered in pollen to give Ivy the needed ingredients from the pollen to heal herself. Listening to the [[Blackgate Penitentiary|Blackgate]] inmates shows that some of them are aware of Sharp's inhumane treatments towards his patients (having occasionally been victims themselves), as well as Sharp often murdering his patients.
* A statue of Amadeus Arkham can be seen outside on the Arkham Asylum stage in the 2017 fighting game ''[[Injustice 2]].''

{{Japanese name|Arisaka}}
Baron {{nihongo|'''Arisaka Nariakira'''|有坂 成章||extra=April 5, 1852 – January 12, 1915}} was a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], and as the inventor of the [[Arisaka|Arisaka Rifle]], is regarded as one of the leading arms designers in [[Japanese history]], alongside [[Kijiro Nambu]].

==Biography==
Arisaka was born in [[Iwakuni, Yamaguchi|Iwakuni]], [[Suo province]] (currently part of [[Yamaguchi prefecture]]) as the 4th son of a ''[[samurai]]'' retainer of [[Chōshū Domain]]. At the age of 11, he was adopted by firearms craftsman Arisaka Nagayoshi, from whom he took his family name. After the [[Meiji Restoration]], he enlisted in the fledgling Imperial Japanese Army. In 1891, he caught the attention of General [[Murata Tsuneyoshi]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}, designer of the [[Murata Rifle]], the standard Japanese Army [[rifle]], and was appointed to a position in the Tokyo Arsenal. 

In 1897, Arisaka completed work on the [[Type 30 Rifle]], an improvement on the Murata Rifle, which was adopted by the Japanese Army as its standard weapon in time for the [[Boxer Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, ''The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1898, he also completed design work on the [[Type 31 75mm Mountain Gun]], and his name became known in the world of [[artillery]] as well as [[small arms]]. However, his earlier designs were not well received by combat troops. The Type 30 Rifle was regarded as underpowered and lacked lethality. The Type 31 guns lacked [[recoil buffer]]s and had poor accuracy. 

In 1903, Arisaka was appointed head of the Army Technical Bureau. He oversaw a committee charged with improving older models, including the Type 30 Rifle. The chief designer on the project was Captain [[Kijirō Nambu|Nambu Kijirō]], who would later attain fame as a weapons designer on his own. The result of this project was the famous [[Type 38 Rifle]], otherwise known as the “Arisaka Rifle”, which was issued to front line [[infantry]] troops just in time for the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_5_50/ai_114283920] Japan's Intriguing Arisakas&lt;/ref&gt; The ruggedness of the Type 38 rifle was praised by combat troops, although the issue of its small caliber was not addressed until much later.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer. ''The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan''. pp44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The Type 38 Rifle, and its various modified versions, continued to be used by the Japanese military until the end of [[World War II]].

Throughout the Russo-Japanese War, Arisaka continued to work on improvements and variations to his rifles, and at the request of [[Imperial Japanese Army General Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Yamagata Aritomo]], he also worked on designs for large [[caliber]] siege weapons and fortress guns{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In 1906, Arisaka was awarded with the [[Order of the Golden Kite]] (2nd Class) and promoted to [[lieutenant general]]. In 1907, he was further elevated to the ''[[kazoku]]'' peerage when he was made a [[baron]] (''danshaku''). In 1910, he was awarded with the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] (1st class).

Arisaka died in 1915, and his grave is at the [[Yanaka Cemetery]] in Tokyo.

==Islamic tradition==
 
The story of Muhammad's encounter with Bahira occurs in the works of the early [[Muslim]] historians [[Ibn Hisham]] (died 833 CE), [[Ibn Sa'd al-Baghdadi]] (784-855), and [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (839-923), whose versions differ in some details. The young Muhammad, then either nine or twelve years old, met Bahira in the town of [[Bosra]] in [[Syria]] while travelling with a [[Mecca]]n [[Camel train|caravan]], accompanying his uncle [[Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib]].&lt;ref name="Bahira"/&gt; When the caravan passed by his cell, the monk invited the merchants to a feast. They accepted the invitation, leaving the boy to guard the camel. Bahira, however, insisted that everyone in the caravan should come to him.&lt;ref name="watt1"/&gt; Then a miraculous occurrence indicated to the monk that Muhammad would become a prophet.

The movement of a cloud that kept shadowing Muhammad regardless of the time of the day drew Bahira's attention. The monk revealed his visions of Muhammad's future to the boy's uncle (Abu Talib), warning him to preserve the child from the [[Jews]] (in Ibn Sa'd's version) or from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] (in al-Tabari's version). Both Ibn Sa'd and al-Tabari write that Bahira found the announcement of the coming of Muhammad in the original, unadulterated [[gospel]]s, which he possessed.&lt;ref name="Bahira"/&gt;

A similar tradition is attributed to [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]] in the works of the early ahadith compiler [[‘Abd al-Razzaq al-San‘ani]], in which the unnamed figure is a rabbi of [[Tayma]] instead of a Christian Syrian monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=9|title=The Expeditions: An Early Biography of Muhammad|publisher=NYU Press|last1=ibn Rashid|first1=Mamar|translator=Sean W. Anthony|isbn=978-0814769638}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rabbi warns Abu Talib against bringing Muhammad to Syria, as he predicts that Muhammad will be killed by the Syrian Jews if they proceed. Abu Talib returns back to Mecca with his nephew. Later Islamic writers gave the rabbi the name of Bahira.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of Sergius Baḥīrā: Eastern Christian Apologetics and Apocalyptic in Response to Islam|last1=Roggema|first1=Barbara|year=2009|publisher=Brill|page=44|isbn=978-9004167308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian tradition==
{{see also|Criticism of Muhammad}}
[[File:Mohammed2.jpg|thumb|''Muhammad and the Monk Sergius'', [[engraving]] of 1508 by [[Lucas van Leyden]] (The soldier takes Muhammad's sword. see text).]] 
In the Christian tradition Bahira became a [[heresy|heretical]] monk, whose errant views inspired the [[Qur'an]].  Bahira is at the center of the ''[[Apocalypse of Bahira]]'', which exists in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and [[Arabic]] which makes the case for an origin of the Qur'an from [[Christian apocrypha]]. Certain [[Arabist]] authors maintain that Bahira's works formed the basis of those parts of the Qur'an that conform to the principles of Christianity, while the rest was introduced either by subsequent compilers such as [[Uthman Ibn Affan]] or contemporary Jews and Arabs.
The names and religious affiliations of the monk vary in different Christian sources. For example, [[John of Damascus]] (d.749), a Christian writer, states that Muhammad "having chanced upon the Old and New Testaments and likewise, it seems, having conversed with an [[Arianism|Arian]] monk, devised his own heresy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx St. John of Damascus's Critique of Islam]; from ''Writings'', by St John of Damascus (''De Haeresibus'', chap. 101), ''The Fathers of the Church'' vol. 37 (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1958), pp. 153-160.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Apology of al-Kindy (book)|Abd-al-Masih al-Kindi]], who calls him Sergius and writes that he later called himself [[Nestorianism|Nestorius]], Bahira was a [[Nasorean]], a group usually conflated with the [[Nestorian Christian|Nestorians]]. After the 9th century, Byzantine polemicists refer to him as Baeira or Pakhyras, both being derivatives of the name Bahira, and describe him as an [[Byzantine iconoclasm|iconoclast]]. Sometimes Bahira is called a [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] or an [[Arianism|Arian]].  The [[Medieval Christian views on Muhammad|early Christian polemical biographies of Muhammad]] share in claiming that any supposed illiteracy of Muhammad did not imply that he received religious instruction solely from the [[angel Gabriel]], and often identified Bahira as a secret, religious teacher to Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Roggema" /&gt;

==1953–1972: Early life==
Chaka Khan was born Yvette Marie Stevens on March 23, 1953 into an artistic, [[bohemian]] household in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]]. The eldest of five children born to Charles Stevens and Sandra Coleman, she has described her father as a [[beatnik]] and her mother as "able to do anything." She was raised in the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] area, "an island in the middle of the madness" of Chicago's rough [[South Side (Chicago)|South Side]] [[Public housing in the United States|housing projects]].&lt;ref name="BBC Gilles Peterson interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04jrlw7 |accessdate=September 27, 2014|title = Words and Music with Chaka Khan|date = September 27, 2014|website = BBC 6 Music (Interview)|last = Peterson|first = Gilles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her sister Yvonne later became a successful musician in her own right under the name [[Taka Boom]]. Her only brother, Mark, who formed the funk group [[Aurra]], also became a successful musician. She has two other sisters, Zaheva Stevens and Tammy McCrary.&lt;ref name="imdb"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0451193/bio |title=Chaka Khan (I) |accessdate=August 24, 2010|website = IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan was raised as a [[Catholic]]. She attributed her love of music to her grandmother, who introduced her to [[jazz]] as a child. Khan became a fan of [[rhythm and blues]] music as a [[preteen]] and at eleven formed a [[girl group]], the Crystalettes, which included her sister Taka. In the late 1960s, Khan attended several [[civil rights]] rallies with her father's second wife, Connie, a strong supporter of the movement, and joined the [[Black Panther Party]] after befriending fellow member, activist, and Chicago native [[Fred Hampton]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/chaka-khan.html |title=Chaka Khan – Biography on Bio |publisher=Thebiographychannel.co.uk |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303234445/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/chaka-khan.html |archivedate=March 3, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though many think that she was given the name Chaka while in the Panthers she has made it clear that her name '''Chaka Adunne Aduffe Hodarhi Karifi''' was given to her at age 13 by a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] [[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]. In 1969, she left the Panthers and dropped out of high school, having attended [[Calumet High School (Chicago)|Calumet High School]] and Kenwood High School (now [[Kenwood Academy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpsalumni.org/school/kenwood-academy-high-school |title=Kenwood Academy High School |publisher=CPSalumni.org |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began to perform in small groups around the Chicago area, first performing with [[Cash McCall (musician)|Cash McCall]]'s group Lyfe, which included her then-boyfriend Hassan Khan.

She was asked to replace [[Baby Huey (singer)|Baby Huey]] of [[Baby Huey &amp; the Babysitters]] after Huey's death in 1970. The group disbanded a year later. While performing in local bands in 1972, Khan was spotted by two members of a new group called [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] and soon won her position in the group (replacing [[rock n roll]] singer Paulette McWilliams). They later signed with [[ABC Records]] in 1973. Prior to signing with the label, she married Khan, changing her stage name to ''Chaka Khan''.

==Career==

===1973–1978: Early career with Rufus===
{{main|Rufus (band)}}
In 1973, Rufus released their [[Rufus (1973 album)|eponymous debut album]]. Despite their fiery rendition of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "Maybe Your Baby" from Wonder's acclaimed ''[[Talking Book]]'' and the modest success of the Chaka-led ballad "Whoever's Thrilling You (Is Killing Me)", the album failed to garner attention. That changed when Wonder himself collaborated with the group on a song he had written for Khan. That song, "[[Tell Me Something Good]]", became the group's breakthrough hit, reaching number-three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1974, later winning the group their first [[Grammy Award]]. The single's success and the subsequent follow-up, "[[You Got the Love (Rufus song)|You Got the Love]]", which peaked at number eleven on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], helped their second parent album, ''[[Rags to Rufus]]'', go platinum, selling over a million copies. From 1974 to 1979, Rufus released six [[RIAA|platinum-selling]] albums including ''[[Rufusized]]'', ''[[Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan (album)|Rufus Featuring Chaka Khan]]'', ''[[Ask Rufus]]'', ''[[Street Player]]'' and ''[[Masterjam]]''. Hits the group scored during this time included "[[Once You Get Started]]," "[[Sweet Thing (Chaka Khan song)|Sweet Thing]]," "Hollywood," "[[At Midnight (My Love Will Lift You Up)]]," and "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]."

The band gained a reputation as a live performing act, with Khan becoming the star attraction, thanks to her powerful vocals and stage [[attire]]—which sometimes included [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] garb and showing her midriff. Most of the band's material was written and produced by the band itself with few exceptions. Khan has also been noted for being an instrumentalist playing drums and bass; she also provided percussion during her tenure with Rufus. Most of her compositions were collaborations with guitarist Tony Maiden. Relations between Khan and the group, particularly between her and Andre Fischer,{{Who|date=January 2018}} became stormy. Several members left with nearly every release. While Khan remained in the group, she signed a solo contract with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1978. While Khan was busy at work on solo material, Rufus released three albums without her participation including 1979's ''[[Numbers (Rufus album)|Numbers]]'', 1980's ''[[Party 'Til You're Broke]]'', and 1983's ''[[Seal in Red]]''.

===1978–1983: Early solo career and final years with Rufus===
In 1978, [[Warner Bros. Records]] released Khan's solo [[Chaka (1978 album)|debut album]], which featured the [[Crossover music|crossover]] [[disco]] hit, "[[I'm Every Woman]]", written for her by singers-songwriters [[Ashford &amp; Simpson]]. The success of the single helped the album go platinum, selling over a million copies. Khan also featured on [[Quincy Jones]]'s hit, "Stuff Like That", also released in 1978, which also featured Ashford &amp; Simpson as co-writers, along with Jones and several others. Ashford &amp; Simpson performed with Khan on the song.

In 1979, Khan reunited with Rufus to collaborate on the Jones-produced ''[[Masterjam]]'', which featured their hit "[[Do You Love What You Feel]]", which Khan sang with Tony Maiden. Despite her sometimes-acrimonious relationship with some of her bandmates, Khan and Maiden have maintained a friendship over the years. In 1979 she also [[duet]]ed with [[Ry Cooder]] on his album ''[[Bop Till You Drop]]''. In 1980, while Rufus released ''Party 'Til You're Broke'', again without Khan, she released her second solo album, ''[[Naughty (album)|Naughty]]'', which featured her on the cover with her six-year-old daughter Milini. The album yielded the disco hit "Clouds" and the R&amp;B [[ballad]] "Papillon".

Also in 1980, Khan had a [[cameo appearance]] as a [[church choir]] soloist in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' starring [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]]. Khan released two albums in 1981, the Rufus release, ''[[Camouflage (Rufus album)|Camouflage]]'' and the solo album ''[[What Cha' Gonna Do for Me]]''. The latter album went gold. The same year, Khan appeared on three tracks on [[Rick Wakeman]]'s concept album ''[[1984 (Rick Wakeman album)|1984]]''. In 1982, Khan issued two more solo albums, the jazz-oriented ''[[Echoes of an Era]]'' and a more [[funk]]/pop-oriented self-titled album ''[[Chaka Khan (1982 album)|Chaka Khan]]''. The latter album's track, the jazz-inflected "Be Bop Medley", won Khan a Grammy and earned praise from jazz singer [[Betty Carter]] who loved Khan's vocal [[scatting]] in the song.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r10811|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( Chaka Khan : Overview )))&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, following the release of Rufus's final studio album, ''Seal in Red'', which did not feature Khan, the singer returned with Rufus on a live album, ''[[Stompin' at the Savoy - Live]]'', which featured the studio single, "[[Ain't Nobody]]", which became the group's final charting success reaching number 22 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and number one on the Hot R&amp;B chart, while also reaching the top ten in the United Kingdom. Following this release, Rufus separated for good.

===1984–1996: Solo success===
In 1984, Khan released her sixth studio album, ''[[I Feel for You (album)|I Feel for You]]''. The [[I Feel for You|title track]], the first single released, was originally written and recorded by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in 1979 and had also been recorded by [[The Pointer Sisters]] and [[Rebbie Jackson]]. Khan's version featured a harmonica solo by [[Stevie Wonder]] and an introductory [[rap]] by [[Grandmaster Melle Mel]]. It became a million-selling smash in the U.S. and United Kingdom and helped to relaunch Khan's career. "[[I Feel for You]]" topped not only the U.S. R&amp;B and dance charts, but achieved great success on the U.S. pop chart and reached No. 1 in the U.K. The song reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in December 1984 and remained on that chart for 26 weeks, well into 1985. Additionally, it hit No. 1 on the [[Cash Box]] chart. It was listed as ''Billboard''′s No. 5 song for 1985 and netted Prince the 1985 [[Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song]]. In addition to the song's successful [[radio airplay]] and sales, a music video of Khan with [[breakdancer]]s in an inner-city setting enjoyed [[heavy rotation]] on television and helped to solidify Khan's notoriety in popular culture.

Other singles that helped the ''I Feel For You'' album go [[RIAA|platinum]] included "[[I Feel for You (album)|This is My Night]]" and the ballad "[[Through the Fire (song)|Through the Fire]]", the latter of which was also successful on the [[adult contemporary]] chart. Khan was featured in [[Steve Winwood]]'s 1986 number-one hit, "[[Higher Love]]". That same year, a [[duet]] was planned with [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]] for the song "[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted To Love]]". However, her manager declined to release the duet, citing the desire to not have too much product from her in the marketplace at one time. She was still credited for the vocal arrangements in the album's [[liner notes]], and the song became an international hit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wolf |first=Buck |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101024#.TrfT7LKwXAg |title=Robert Palmer Never Meant to Turn Us On – ABC News |publisher=ABC News |accessdate=February 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan followed up the success of the ''I Feel For You'' album with 1986's ''[[Destiny (Chaka Khan album)|Destiny]]'' and 1988's ''[[CK (album)|CK]]''. Khan found more success in the late 1980s with a [[remix album]], ''[[Life Is a Dance: The Remix Project]]'', which reached the top ten on the British albums chart. As a result, she performed regularly in the U.K., where she maintained a strong [[fan base]].

In 1990, she was a featured performer on another major hit when she collaborated with [[Ray Charles]] and [[Quincy Jones]] on a [[new jack swing]] cover of [[The Brothers Johnson]]'s "[[I'll Be Good to You]]", which was featured on Jones's ''[[Back on the Block]]''. The song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart, later winning her and Ray Charles a Grammy for Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance By a Duo or Group. Khan returned with her first studio album in four years in 1992 with the release of ''[[The Woman I Am]]'', which was a success due to the R&amp;B songs "Love You All My Lifetime" and "You Can Make the Story Right".

Khan also contributed to soundtracks and worked on a follow-up to ''The Woman I Am'' she titled ''Dare You to Love Me'', which was eventually shelved. In 1995, she and rapper [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] had a hit with the duet "Watch What You Say", in the U.K. That same year, she provided a [[contemporary R&amp;B]] cover of the classic [[Standard (music)|standard]], "[[My Funny Valentine]]", for the ''[[Waiting to Exhale (soundtrack)|Waiting to Exhale]]'' soundtrack. In 1996, following the release of her [[greatest-hits album]], ''[[Epiphany: The Best of Chaka Khan, Vol. 1]]'', Khan abruptly left Warner Bros. after stating the label had neglected her and failed to release ''Dare You to Love Me''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/301491|title=Interview, thestar.com February 9, 2008|work=thestar.com|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998–present===
[[File:Chaka Khan.jpg|thumb|170px|Khan performing in 2006]]
In 1998, Khan signed a contract with Prince's [[NPG Records]] label and issued ''[[Come 2 My House]]'', followed by the single "[[Don't Talk 2 Strangers]]", a cover of a 1996 [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song. She later went on a [[Tour (music)|tour]] with Prince as a co-headlining act. In 2000, Khan departed NPG and in 2004 released her first jazz [[Cover (music)|cover]]s album in twenty-two years with 2004's ''[[ClassiKhan]]''. She also covered "[[Little Wing]]" with [[Kenny Olson]] on the album ''[[Power of Soul: A Tribute to Jimi Hendrix]]''. Three years later, after signing with [[Burgundy Records]], Khan released what many critics called a "comeback album" with ''[[Funk This]]'', produced by [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] &amp; Big Jim Wright. The album featured the hit, "Angel", and the [[Mary J. Blige]] duet, "Disrespectful". The latter track went to number one on the U.S. dance singles chart, winning the singers a Grammy Award, while ''Funk This'' also won a Grammy for [[Best R&amp;B Album]]. The album was also notable for Khan's covers of [[Dee Dee Warwick]]'s "Foolish Fool" and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]'s "[[Sign o' the Times (song)|Sign o' the Times]]". In 2008, Khan participated in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of ''[[The Color Purple (musical)|The Color Purple]]'' playing Ms. Sofia to [[Fantasia Barrino]]'s Celie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/30/theater/30mcge.html?ex=1215061200&amp;en=660d853e43d071cd&amp;ei=5087&amp;WT.mc_id=TH-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M010-ROS-0108-HDR&amp;WT.mc_ev=click&amp;mkt=TH-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M010-ROS-0108-HDR |title=The Many Shades of Chaka Khan, Now in 'Purple' |work=The New York Times |author=McGee, Celia |date=December 30, 2007 |accessdate=January 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, Chaka Khan was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from [[Berklee College of Music]] during the inauguration of its president, Roger H. Brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mintel |first=Eric |url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/berklee-college-of-music-inaugurates-its-3rd-president-roger-h-brown-chaka-khan-and-dennis-chambers-accept-honorary-doctorates-of-music-james-taylor-lauds-colleges-choice-of-brown.php |title=Jazz news: Berklee College of Music Inaugurates its 3rd President, Roger H.

In a 2008 interview Khan said that she, unlike other artists, felt very optimistic about the current changes in the recording industry, including [[music downloading]]. "I'm glad things are shifting and artists – not labels – are having more control over their art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven't seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes [[Robert Palmer (singer)|Robert Palmer]]'s original recording of '[[Addicted to Love (song)|Addicted to Love]]' – which they took my vocals off of! We are working on getting it (and other tracks) all back now."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers [[Anastacia]] and [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]] for [[Here Come the Girls (concert tour)|Here Come the Girls]].

In 2009, Chaka was guest singer with the song "Alive"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKg-ZpXxwvc&amp;feature=fvwrel |title=CHAKA KHAN – BILLY COBHAM – GINO VANNELLI I – Drum 'n' voice vol.3 (produced by Nicolosi / Novecento) |accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; on jazz drummer [[Billy Cobham]]'s album ''Drum ' n voice 3''. In 2010, she contributed to vocals for [[Beverley Knight]]'s "[[Soul Survivor (Beverley Knight song)|Soul Survivor]]", collaborated with [[Clay Aiken]] on a song for the kids show ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'', and performed two songs with Japanese singer [[Ai (singer)|Ai]] on Ai's latest album ''The Last Ai''. Khan continues to perform to packed audiences both in her native United States and overseas.

On May 19, 2011, Khan was given the 2,440th [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star plaque on a section of Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles. Her family was present when the singer accepted the honor, as was [[Stevie Wonder]], who had written her breakout hit "[[Tell Me Something Good]]". On September 27, 2011, the [[Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame]] committee announced that Khan and her former band [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] were jointly nominated for induction to the hall. It was the collective's first nomination 13 years after they were first eligible. The group were nominated partly due to Khan's own storied reputation, including her own solo career in conjunction with her years with Rufus. Recently, Khan rerecorded her song, "Super Life", under the title "Super Life: Fear Kills, Love Heals" with [[Eric Benet]], [[Kelly Price]], and [[Luke James]] in tribute to [[Trayvon Martin]], a teenager who was killed on February 26. A number of celebrities also joined in the recording including [[Loretta Devine]], [[Terry Crews]], [[Eva Pigford]], and reporter [[Kevin Frazier]].

On December 6, 2012, Chaka Khan made a controversial decision to perform at a benefit for the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF originally invited Stevie Wonder, however after a successful lobbying campaign by the US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation, Wonder withdrew and was replaced by Khan who was able to raise $14&amp;nbsp;million for the IDF. This support contrasted with her earlier support for the Black Panther Party that publicly supported a Free Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/2012/12/28/arts-entertainment/gentiles-of-the-year-2012 |title="Gentiles of the Year 2012" | work=JTA (Jewish Telegraphic Agency) |author=JTA Staff |date=December 28, 2012 |accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=3379 |title=We Did It! | work=US Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation |date=December 27, 2012 |accessdate=August 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lebanesestudies.ojs.chass.ncsu.edu/index.php/mashriq/article/view/61/121 | title="Our Declaration of Independence": African Americans, Arab Americans and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1967–1979" |work=Mashriq &amp; Mahjar, vol. 3, no. 1 (2015) |accessdate=August 11, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2013, Khan was honored 40 years after signing her first recording contract with a ceremonial renaming of Blackstone Avenue between 50th and 51st street (where her former high school, Kenwood Academy, sits) as Chaka Khan Way and on July 28 the city declared the day Chaka Khan Day. She performed at [[Millennium Park]]'s [[Pritzker Pavilion]] on the 28th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2013/07/29/5605721/the-city-of-chicago-honors-ten.html|title=The City of Chicago Honors Ten-Time GRAMMY® Award Winner Chaka Khan with Street Naming|accessdate=July 31, 2013|date=July 29, 2013|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|author=Khan, Chaka|agency=[[PR Newswire]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130731104301/http://www.sacbee.com/2013/07/29/5605721/the-city-of-chicago-honors-ten.html|archivedate=July 31, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Khan served as grand marshal at the 85th annual [[Bud Billiken Parade and Picnic]] in her hometown of Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chicago.cbslocal.com/2014/08/09/bud-billiken-parade-like-a-big-homecoming-to-grand-marshal-chaka-khan/|title=CBS Chicago:Bud Billiken Parade ‘Like A Big Homecoming’ To Grand Marshal Chaka Khan (August 9, 2014)|publisher=|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018 she released a new single called "Like Sugar", a collaboration with [[Major Lazer]] member Switch. An album featuring the song is expected to be released later this year.

==Personal life==
Khan has been married twice and is the mother of two, daughter Indira Milini and son Damien Holland. Her first marriage was to Hassan Khan, in 1970, when she was 17, which ended in divorce a short time later. Milini's birth was the result of a relationship between Khan and Rahsaan Morris.&lt;ref name="imdb" /&gt; Khan married her second husband, Richard Holland, in 1976. The marriage reportedly caused a rift between Khan and several members of Rufus, in particular, Andre Fischer. Holland wanted her to tone down her sexy stage image, but she refused. He filed for divorce in 1980, citing "irreconcilable differences."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 6, 1982|title=Chaka Khan Reveals Feelings on Sex, Marriage, Drugs And Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rkEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;lpg=PA55&amp;dq=Richard+Holland+chaka+khan+1980&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qd0MDpONTe&amp;sig=LJPIPSKBy4p8kdiYZJafZeQr3iw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjz2u7Gzv_YAhWDuVMKHVVhAeA4ChDoAQhQMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Richard%20Holland%20chaka%20khan%201980&amp;f=false|journal=Jet Magazine|volume= 63| issue =  13|page=55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khan dated a Chicago-area [[schoolteacher]] in the mid-1980s in the middle of her solo [[stardom]]. Following their separation, Khan moved to Europe, first settling in London, later buying a residence in Germany. She lived in Germany for a while "in a little village in the Rhine Valley" and also in [[Mannheim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chaka Khan's Travelling Life|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/celebrity-interviews/Chaka-Khans-Travelling-Life/|website=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=April 23, 2016|date=July 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan is [[vegan]], saying she adopted the diet to lose weight and combat [[high blood pressure]] and [[Type-2 diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;Brennan Williams, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/18/chaka-khan-weight-loss-new-music-sex-symbol_n_1606606.html "Chaka Khan Opens Up on Weight Loss, New Music, Being a Sex Symbol"], ''Huffington Post'', June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, Khan struggled with [[drug abuse]] and alcoholism. Her drug use, which at times included [[cocaine]] and heroin, ended in the early 1990s. Khan had an on-and-off struggle with alcoholism until 2005 declaring herself [[sobriety|sober]]. In 2006, her son Damien Holland was accused of murder after 17-year-old Christopher Bailey was shot to death. Khan testified on her son's behalf. Holland claimed the shooting was an accident and was found not guilty.&lt;ref name="Arnold 2007 115–117"&gt;{{cite news | first = Chuck | last = Arnold | title = Chaka Khan Through the Fire | year = 2007 | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | url = http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=4&amp;hid=9&amp;sid=38820f2a-6b88-44ac-bc73-cbeeda037cf0%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=a2h&amp;AN=27180285 | pages = 115–117 | accessdate = May 18, 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she sang at both the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|2000 Democratic]] and [[2000 Republican National Convention|Republican convention]]s, Khan says that she is more of a "Democratic-minded person".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046343|title=Chaka Khan Siding with the Democratic Ticket|date=November 6, 2006|author=Rosen, Craig}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, she won permanent [[Custody transfer|custody]] of her granddaughter by son Damien Holland, Daija Jade Holland, after reporting that Daija's mother, Holland's girlfriend, was unable to raise her due to her [[drug addiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essence.com/2011/12/16/chaka-khan-awarded-custody-of-granddaughter/|title=Chaka Khan Awarded Custody of Granddaughter|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|date=December 16, 2011|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khan was featured in a 2013 episode of ''[[Celebrity Ghost Stories]]'' where she told the story of a [[Shadow person|shadow man]] who followed her on tour for years, until she met a [[guardian angel]] who admonished her to change her life or die.&lt;ref&gt;''Celebrity Ghost Stories,'' 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christabel Bielenberg''' (18 June 1909 – 2 November 2003) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] writer who was married to a [[Germany|German]] lawyer, Peter Bielenberg. She described her experiences living in Germany during the [[Second World War]] in two books: ''The Past is Myself'' (1968) and ''The Road Ahead''. She was educated at [[St Margaret's School, Bushey|St Margaret's School]], [[Bushey]], [[Hertfordshire]].

==Life==
'''Christabel Mary Burton''' was born in [[Totteridge]], [[Hertfordshire]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0081401/ Christabel Bielenberg - IMDb] Retrieved 2016-10-29.&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Anglo-Irish]] parents. Her mother, Christabel Harmsworth, was the sister of Lords [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Northcliffe]], [[Cecil Bisshopp Harmsworth, 1st Baron Harmsworth|Harmsworth]], and [[Harold Sidney Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere|Rothermere]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/christabel-bielenberg-730352.html Obituary] in ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Christabel Mary won a scholarship to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], but decided instead to study music in Germany. While there she met Peter Bielenberg (1911–2001), two years her junior, who was studying law with a view to joining his father's practice in [[Hamburg]]. 

They married in 1934 and she took [[German citizenship]], which required her to relinquish her [[British citizenship]]. The Bielenbergs lived initially in Hamburg, then moved to [[Berlin]] and had three sons, Nicholas, Christopher, and John. The heavy Allied bombing raids led Mrs Bielenberg and her children to leave the city, and they eventually settled in the village of Rohrbach, near [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald]], in the [[Black Forest]].

Both Christabel and Peter Bielenberg were opposed to [[Nazism]] and following [[Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933, participated in [[German resistance to Nazism|anti-Nazi activities]]. Peter Bielenberg was a close friend of [[Adam von Trott zu Solz]], who was involved in the [[July 20 Plot|Stauffenberg bomb plot against Hitler]] of 1944, and as a result of his suspect political views and this close association he was arrested, interrogated, and imprisoned in [[Ravensbrück concentration camp]] following the failure of the plot. In an effort to secure his release, Christabel Bielenberg asked to be interviewed by the [[Gestapo]] in order to convince them of her and her husband's political naivety and innocence. She was successful and he was released to a punishment unit but mistakenly allowed leave before joining it. He managed to slip away and remained in hiding near his family until the fighting ended.

After the war, she returned to Britain with her children, later visiting Germany as a [[foreign correspondent]] for ''[[The Observer]]''.  In 1948, the family settled in [[Tullow]], [[County Carlow, Ireland]], buying a dilapidated farm called "Munny House", which they transformed into a commercial success. As well as writing her autobiography she became involved with the Irish Peace Marches of the 1970s and lectured in Germany. She was made a Commander of the [[Federal Cross of Merit|German Federal Order of Merit]] and was also awarded a Gold Medal of Merit by the [[European Parliament]].

==Legacy==
Her experiences during the Second World War were made into the [[BBC television]] drama serial ''[[Christabel (1988 TV drama)|Christabel]]'' (1988), adapted from her memoir by [[Dennis Potter]]. [[Elizabeth Hurley]] starred in the title role. In 1974 Christabel described her experiences of attempting to shelter Jews hiding from persecution in the television series ''[[The World at War]]''.

== Portrait bust==
Christabel Bielenberg sat for sculptor [[Alan Thornhill]] for a portrait in clay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alanthornhill.co.uk/sm_008.htm Portrait head of Christabel Bielenberg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719115218/http://alanthornhill.co.uk/sm_008.htm |date=July 19, 2008 }}, image of sculpture&lt;/ref&gt;  The correspondence file relating to the Bielenberg bust is held in the archive of the [[Henry Moore Foundation]]'s [[Henry Moore Institute]] in [[Leeds]] and the terracotta remains in the collection of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=584 HMI Archive] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112193428/http://www.henry-moore-fdn.co.uk/matrix_engine/content.php?page_id=584 |date=January 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
She had three sons, Nicholas, John and Christopher ("Kim"). Nick's son Andy is a historian at [[University College Cork]]; Nick's son Kim works as a journalist in [[Dublin]]. Nicholas's wife was Charlotte, daughter of [[Fritz-Dietlof von der Schulenburg]].

'''Egyptians''' ({{lang-arz|مَصريين}} &amp;nbsp;{{IPA-arz|mɑsˤɾɪjˈjiːn|IPA}}; ''{{transl|arz|DIN|Maṣreyyīn}}''; {{lang-ar|مِصريّون}}; {{Lang-cop|ⲛⲓⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ}} ''Ni/rem/en/kīmi'') are an [[ethnic group]] native to [[Egypt]] and the citizens of that country sharing a common culture and a common dialect known as [[Egyptian Arabic]].

Egyptian identity is closely tied to [[Geography of Egypt|geography]]. The population of Egypt is concentrated in the lower [[Nile]] Valley, the small strip of cultivable land stretching from the [[Cataracts of the Nile|First Cataract]] to the Mediterranean and enclosed by desert both to the [[Eastern Desert|east]] and to the [[Western Desert (North Africa)|west]]. This unique geography has been the basis of the development of Egyptian society since [[Ancient Egypt|antiquity]].

The daily language of the Egyptians is the local [[variety of Arabic]], known as [[Egyptian Arabic]] or ''Masri. ''Additionally, a sizable minority of Egyptians living in Upper Egypt speak [[Sa'idi Arabic]]. Egyptians are predominantly adherents of [[Sunni Islam]] with a [[Shia]] minority and a significant proportion who follow native [[Sufi]] [[tariqah|orders]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman"&gt;Hoffman, Valerie J. ''Sufism, Mystics, and Saints in Modern Egypt''. University of South Carolina Press, 1995. [http://www.sc.edu/uscpress/1995/3055.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050829032403/http://www.sc.edu/uscpress/1995/3055.html|date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable percentage of Egyptians belong to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]], whose [[liturgical language]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], is the most recent stage of the indigenous [[Egyptian language]] and is still used in prayers along with [[Arabic]].

== Terminology ==
Egyptians receive or have received several names:
* '''Egyptians''', from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Αἰγύπτιοι}}, ''{{transl|grc|Aiguptioi}}'', from {{lang|grc|Αἴγυπτος}}, ''{{transl|grc|Aiguptos}}'' "Egypt". The Greek name is derived from [[Late Egyptian]] ''Hikuptah'' "[[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]", a corruption of the earlier [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name ''Hat-ka-Ptah'' ({{transl|egy|ḥwt-k3-ptḥ}}), meaning "home of the [[Egyptian soul|ka]] (soul) of Ptah", the name of a temple to the god [[Ptah]] at Memphis. [[Strabo]] provided a [[folk etymology]] according to which {{lang|grc|Αἴγυπτος}} had evolved as a compound from {{transl|grc|Aἰγαίου ὑπτίως}} ''{{transl|grc|Aegaeou huptiōs}}'', meaning "below the Aegean". In English, the noun "Egyptians" appears in the 14th century, in [[Wycliff's Bible]], as ''Egipcions''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
* '''[[Copts]]''' (قبط, ''{{transl|ar|qibṭ, qubṭ}}''), also a derivative of the [[Greek language|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|Αἰγύπτιος}}, ''Aiguptios'' ("Egyptian"), that appeared under [[Muslim empire|Muslim]] rule to refer to indigenous population of Egypt and to separate them from the Arabs. [[Coptic language|Coptic]] was the language of the state, Church and people &lt;ref&gt;http://cdm15831.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/cce/id/520&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://st-takla.org/books/pauline-todary/coptic-language/ages.html&lt;/ref&gt; but then got replaced by [[Arabic language|Arabic]] after the Muslim conquest&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://books.google.com.eg/books/about/The_Muslim_Conquest_of_Egypt_and_North_A.html?id=FZ8JAQAAIAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|title=The Muslim Conquest of Egypt and North Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/reference-populations-next-gen/|title=National Geographic Geno 2.0 Project - Egypt|quote=Egypt= 71% North and East African. As ancient populations first migrated from Africa, they passed first through northeast Africa to southwest Asia. The Northern Africa and Arabian components in Egypt are representative of that ancient migratory route, as well as later migrations from the Fertile Crescent back into Africa with the spread of agriculture over the past 10,000 years, and migrations in the seventh century with the spread of Islam from the Arabian Peninsula. The East African component likely reflects localized movement up the navigable Nile River, while the Southern Europe and Asia Minor components reflect the geographic and historical role of Egypt as a historical player in the economic and cultural growth across the Mediterranean region.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Islam became the dominant religion in Egypt due to mass [[religious conversion|conversions]] from Christianity to Islam mainly from the poor masses after being unable to regularly pay the [[Jizyah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://cairoscene.com/Buzz/National-Geographic-s-DNA-Analysis-Proves-Egyptians-Are-Only-17-Arab|title=National Geographic DNA analysis proves Egyptians are only 17% Arab}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the modern term then became exclusively associated with [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Christianity]] and Coptic Christians who are members of the Coptic Orthodox Church or Coptic Catholic Church, though references to native Muslims as Copts are attested until the [[Mamluk]] period.&lt;ref&gt;C.

There are an estimated 92.1 million Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Egypt" /&gt; Most are native to Egypt, where Egyptians constitute around 91% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martino (ed.)|first1=John|title=Worldwide Government Directory with Intergovernmental Organizations 2013|date=2013|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=1452299374|page=508|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=CQWhAQAAQBAJ&amp;q=%2299.6%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%2299.6%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 84–90% of the population of Egypt are [[Muslim]] adherents and 10–15% are [[Christian]] adherents (10–15% [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]], 1% other Christian) according to estimates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/281789/Egypt/Politics-/Egypts-Sisi-meets-world-Evangelical-churches-deleg.aspx|title=Egypt's Sisi meets world Evangelical churches delegation in Cairo |work=Al-Ahram Weekly |language=en|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Factbook"&gt;Egypt.

Close to half of the Egyptian people today are urban; most of the rest are [[fellahin]] that are native, along with descendants of several Arab tribes living in rural towns and villages. A large influx of fellahin into urban cities, and rapid urbanization of many rural areas since the early 20th century, have shifted the balance between the number of urban and rural citizens. Egyptians also form smaller minorities in neighboring countries, North America, Europe and Australia.

Egyptians also tend to be provincial, meaning their attachment extends not only to Egypt but to the specific [[Governorates of Egypt|provinces]], towns and villages from which they hail. Therefore, return migrants, such as temporary workers abroad, come back to their region of origin in Egypt. According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], an estimated 2.7 million Egyptians live abroad and contribute actively to the development of their country through remittances (US$7.8 billion in 2009), circulation of human and social capital, as well as investment. Approximately 70% of Egyptian migrants live in Arab countries (923,600 in [[Saudi Arabia]], 332,600 in [[Libya]], 226,850 in [[Jordan]], 190,550 in [[Kuwait]] with the rest elsewhere in the region) and the remaining 30% are living mostly in Europe and North America (318,000 in the [[United States]], 110,000 in [[Canada]] and 90,000 in [[Italy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |title=Migration And Development In Egypt |format=PDF |accessdate=2017-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501234716/http://www.egypt.iom.int/Doc/IOM%20Migration%20and%20Development%20in%20Egypt%20Facts%20and%20Figures%20(English).pdf |archive-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No Egyptian is ever far from his river and, except for the [[Alexandria|Alexandrines]] whose personality is split by looking outward toward the Mediterranean, the Egyptians are a hinterland people with little appetite for travel, even inside their own country. They glorify their national dishes, including the [[Ful Medames|variety of concoctions surrounding the simple bean]]. Most of all, they have a sense of all-encompassing familiarity at home and a sense of alienation when abroad ...

A sizable [[Egyptian diaspora]] did not begin to form until well into the 1980s, when political and economic conditions began driving Egyptians out of the country in significant numbers. Today, the diaspora numbers nearly 4 million (2006 est).&lt;ref name="Ahram Weekly 1"&gt;of which c. 4 million in the [[Egyptian diaspora]]. Newsreel.

On the other hand, Egyptians migrating to Arab countries almost always only go there with the intention of returning to Egypt; virtually none settle in the new country on a permanent basis.&lt;ref name="Talani"&gt;Talani, Leila S.

Prior to 1974, only few Egyptian professionals had left the country in search for employment. Political, demographic and economic pressures led to the first wave of emigration after 1952. Later more Egyptians left their homeland first after the 1973 boom in oil prices and again in 1979, but it was only in the second half of the 1980s that Egyptian migration became prominent.&lt;ref name="Talani" /&gt;

Egyptian emigration today is motivated by even higher rates of unemployment, population growth and increasing prices. Political repression and human rights violations by Egypt's ruling régime are other contributing factors (see {{format link|Egypt#Human rights}}). Egyptians have also been impacted by the wars between Egypt and [[Israel]], particularly after the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, when migration rates began to rise. In August 2006, Egyptians made headlines when 11 students from [[Mansoura University]] failed to show up at their American host institutions for a cultural exchange program in the hope of finding employment.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Josh. {{cite web |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_county/bal-md.co.egyptians13aug13,0,4970784.story?coll=bal-local-headlines |title=Egyptians came for jobs, then built lives |accessdate=2008-04-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819050909/http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/local/baltimore_county/bal-md.co.egyptians13aug13,0,4970784.story?coll=bal-local-headlines |archivedate=August 19, 2006 |df= }}.

{{further|Pan-Arabism|Pharaonism|Coptic identity}}
[[File:The-irrepressible-donkey-boys-at-Cairo.jpg|thumb|300px|Egyptian donkey herders at the start of the British occupation of Egypt, circa 1860s.]]
The degree to which Egyptians identify with each layer of Egypt's history in articulating a sense of collective identity can vary. Questions of identity came to fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to free themselves from British occupation, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as "Pharaonism"). After Egyptians gained their independence from Great Britain, other forms of nationalism developed, including secular [[Arab nationalism]] as well as [[Islamism]].

"Pharaonism" rose to political prominence in the 1920s and 1930s during the British occupation, as Egypt developed separately from the [[Arab world]]. A segment of the most Westernized upper class argued that Egypt was part of a [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean civilization]]. This ideology largely developed out of the country's lengthy pre-Islamic pre-Arab history, the relative isolation of the [[Nile Valley]] and the mostly homogeneous indigenous non-Arab genetic ancestry/ethnicity of the inhabitants,&lt;ref name="Hinnesbusch"&gt;Hinnesbusch, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of current religious identity. One of Pharaonism's most notable advocates was [[Taha Hussein]] who remarked "Pharaonism is deeply rooted in the spirits of the Egyptians. It will remain so, and it must continue and become stronger. The Egyptian is Pharaonic before being Arab."&lt;ref&gt;[[Taha Hussein]], "Kwakab el Sharq", August 12th 1933: إن الفرعونية متأصلة فى نفوس المصريين ، وستبقى كذلك بل يجب أن تبقى وتقوى ، والمصرى فرعونى قبل أن يكون عربياً ولا يطلب من مصر أن تتخلى عن فرعونيتها وإلا كان معنى ذلك : اهدمى يا مصر أبا الهول والأهرام، وانسى نفسك واتبعينا ... لا تطلبوا من مصر أكثر مما تستطيع أن تعطى ، مصر لن تدخل فى وحدة عربية سواء كانت العاصمة القاهرة أم دمشق أم بغداد&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharaonism became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists of the pre-war and inter-war periods. In 1931, following a visit to Egypt, Syrian Arab nationalist [[Sati' al-Husri]] remarked that "[Egyptians] did not possess an Arab nationalist sentiment; did not accept that Egypt was a part of the Arab lands, and would not acknowledge that the Egyptian people were part of the Arab nation."&lt;ref&gt;qtd in Dawisha, Adeed. ''Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century''. Princeton University Press. 2003, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; The later 1930s would become a formative period for Arab nationalism in Egypt, in large part due to efforts by Syrian, Palestinian and Lebanese intellectuals.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, "Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism", p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab-Islamic political sentiment was fueled by the solidarity felt between Egyptians struggling for independence from Britain and those across the Arab world engaged in similar anti-imperialist struggles. In particular, the growth of [[Zionism]] in neighboring Palestine was seen as a threat by many Egyptians and the cause of resistance there was adopted by rising Islamic movements such as the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] as well as the political leadership including [[Faruq I|King Faruq I]] and Prime Minister [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]].&lt;ref name="Hinnesbusch"/&gt; Nevertheless, a year after the establishment of the [[Arab League|League of Arab States]] in 1945, to be headquartered in Cairo, [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] historian H. S. Deighton was still writing:

{{quote|The Egyptians are not Arabs, and both they and the Arabs are aware of this fact. They are Arabic-speaking, and they are [predominantly] Muslim[. I]ndeed [the Muslim] religion plays a greater part in their lives than it does in those either of the [Muslim] Syrians or the Iraqi [Muslims]. But the Egyptian, during the first thirty years of the [twentieth] century, was not aware of any particular bond with the Arab East... Egypt sees in the Arab cause a worthy object of real and active sympathy and, at the same time, a great and proper opportunity for the exercise of leadership, as well as for the enjoyment of its fruits. But [Egypt,] she is still Egyptian first and Arab only in consequence, and her main interests are still domestic.&lt;ref&gt;Deighton, H. S. "The Arab Middle East and the Modern World", International Affairs, vol. xxii, no. 4 (October 1946), p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It was not until the [[Nasser era]] more than a decade later that Arab nationalism, and by extension [[Arab socialism]], became a state policy and a means with which to define Egypt's position in the Middle East and the world,&lt;ref&gt;"Before Nasser, Egypt, which had been ruled by Britain since 1882, was more in favor of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan-Arab ideology. Egyptians generally did not identify themselves as Arabs, and it is revealing that when the Egyptian nationalist leader [Saad Zaghlul] met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, claiming that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one." Makropoulou, Ifigenia. [http://www.ekem.gr/archives/2007/01/pan_arabism_wha.html Pan – Arabism: What Destroyed the Ideology of Arab Nationalism?]. Hellenic Center for European Studies. January 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; usually articulated vis-à-vis Zionism in the neighboring new state of [[Israel]]. Nasser's politics was shaped by his conviction that all the Arab states were contending with anti-imperialist struggles and thus solidarity between them was imperative for independence. He viewed the earlier Egyptian nationalism of [[Saad Zaghlul]] as too inward-looking and saw no conflict between Egyptian patriotism (''wataniyya'') and Arab nationalism (''qawmiyya'').&lt;ref name="Hinnesbusch94"&gt;Hinnesbusch, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while Egypt and [[Syria]] formed the [[United Arab Republic]] (UAR). When the union was dissolved, Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971, when Egypt adopted the current official name, the Arab Republic of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"1971 – Egypt's new constitution is introduced and the country is renamed the Arab Republic of Egypt." [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/790978.stm Timeline Egypt]. BBC News, Timeline: Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptians' attachment to Arabism was particularly questioned after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives, and the country became disillusioned with Arab politics.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Arabism instilled in the country by Nasser was not deeply embedded in society, a certain kinship with the rest of the Arab world was firmly established and Egypt saw itself as the leader of this larger cultural entity. Nasser's version of [[pan-Arabism]] stressed Egyptian sovereignty and leadership of Arab unity instead of the eastern Arab states.&lt;ref name="Hinnesbusch94"/&gt;

Nasser's successor [[Anwar el-Sadat]], both through public policy and his peace initiative with Israel, revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. According to Dawisha, the terms "Arab", "Arabism" and "Arab unity", save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent.&lt;ref&gt;Dawisha, pp. 264–65, 267&lt;/ref&gt; (See also [[Egyptians#Liberal age|Liberal age]] and [[Egyptians#Republic|Republic]] sections.) However, despite Sadat's systematic attempts to root out Arab sentiment, Arab nationalism in Egypt remained a potent force.&lt;ref name="Barakat4"/&gt;

During this era, in 1978, Egyptian-American sociologist [[Saad Eddin Ibrahim]] studied the national discourse between 17 Egyptian intellectuals relating to Egypt's identity and peace with Israel. He noted that in 18 articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|conflict]] opposed, while in eight articles Arab identity was acknowledged and neutrality supported and only in three articles written by author [[Louis Awad]] was Arab identity rejected and neutrality supported.&lt;ref name="Barakat5"/&gt; Egyptian scholar [[Gamal Hamdan]] stressed that Egyptian identity was unique, but that Egypt was the center and "cultural hub" of the Arab world, arguing that "Egypt in the Arab world is like Cairo in Egypt." Hamdan further contended "We do not see the Egyptian personality, no matter how distinct it may be, as anything other than a part of the personality of the greater Arab homeland."&lt;ref name="Barakat4"&gt;Barakat, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Egyptians today feel that Egyptian and Arab identities are inextricably linked, and emphasize the central role that Egypt plays in the Arab world. Others continue to believe that Egypt and Egyptians are simply not Arab, emphasizing indigenous Egyptian heritage, culture and independent polity, pointing to the perceived failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies. Egyptian anthropologist Laila el-Hamamsy illustrates the modern-day relationship between the two trends, stating: "in light of their history, Egyptians ... should be conscious of their national identity and consider themselves, above all, Egyptians. How is the Egyptian, with this strong sense of Egyptian identity, able to look himself as an Arab too?"&lt;ref&gt;Barakat, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Her explanation is that Egyptianization translated as Arabization with the result being "an increased tempo of Arabization, for facility in the Arabic language opened the windows into the rich legacy of Arabic culture. ... Thus in seeking a cultural identity, Egypt has revived its Arab cultural heritage."&lt;ref name="Barakat5"&gt;Barakat, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian critics of Arab nationalism contend that it has worked to erode and/or relegate native Egyptian identity by superimposing only one aspect of Egypt's culture. These views and sources for collective identification in the Egyptian state are captured in the words of a linguistic anthropologist who conducted fieldwork in Cairo:

{{quote|Historically, Egyptians have considered themselves as distinct from 'Arabs' and even at present rarely do they make that identification in casual contexts; ''il-'arab'' [the Arabs] as used by Egyptians refers mainly to the inhabitants of the Gulf states... Egypt has been both a leader of pan-Arabism and a site of intense resentment towards that ideology. Egyptians had to be made, often forcefully, into "Arabs" [during the Nasser era] because they did not historically identify themselves as such. Egypt was self-consciously a nation not only before pan-Arabism but also before becoming a colony of the British Empire. Its territorial continuity since ancient times, its unique history as exemplified in its pharaonic past and later on its Coptic language and culture, had already made Egypt into a nation for centuries. Egyptians saw themselves, their history, culture and language as specifically Egyptian and not "Arab."&lt;ref&gt;Haeri, Niloofar.

[[File:Egyptian school teacher.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Luxor]] school teacher lecturing on [[Eastern Arabic numerals]].]]
[[File:Coptic.jpg|thumb|A 3rd-century Coptic inscription.]]
In the [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]], Egyptians spoke the [[Archaic Egyptian language]]. In antiquity, Egyptians spoke the [[Egyptian language]]. It constitutes its own branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family. The [[Coptic language]] is the direct descendant of the Egyptian language, written in [[Coptic alphabet]].

[[Arabic language|Arabic]] was adopted by the rulers of Egypt after the Arab invasion and gradually came to replace [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/eamonn-gearon/arab-invasions-first-islamic-empire|title=Arab Invasions: The First Islamic Empire {{!}} History Today|website=www.historytoday.com|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoken Coptic was mostly extinct by the 17th century but may have survived in isolated pockets in [[Upper Egypt]] as late as the 19th century.&lt;ref name=extinct&gt;The language may have survived in isolated pockets in [[Upper Egypt]] as late as the 19th century, according to James Edward Quibell, "When did Coptic become extinct?" in ''Zeitschrift für ägyptische Sprache und Altertumskunde'', 39 (1901), p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[official language]] of Egypt today is [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The spoken vernacular is known as [[Egyptian Arabic]], while [[Modern Standard Arabic]] is reserved for more formal contexts as is the case in all Arab countries.

The recorded history of Egyptian Arabic as a separate dialect begins in [[Ottoman Egypt]] with a document by a 17th-century author writing about the peculiarities of the speech of the Egyptian people.&lt;ref&gt;''{{transl|ar|Dafʻ al-ʼiṣr ʻan kalām ʼahl Miṣr}}'' ('The Removal of the Burden from the Language of the People of Egypt') by {{transl|ar|[[Yūsuf al-Maġribi]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the language by then was spoken by the majority of Egyptians. It is represented in a body of [[vernacular literature]] comprising novels, plays and poetry published over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Classical Arabic]] is also a significant cultural element in Egyptian culture, as Egyptian novelists and poets were among the first to experiment with modern styles of Arabic literature, and the forms they developed have been widely imitated.

While a huge majority of the Egyptian Arabic dialect is derived from the formal Arabic language, it has also been highly influenced by many other languages such as [[French language|French]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and the old [[Egyptian language]]. This is widely thought to be the effects of being the victim of several invasions, including that of the Ottoman Empire as well as the French invasion. As each nation came and went, the Egyptians kept the few words and phrases that made the language seem easier.

It is also noteworthy that the Egyptian dialect is the most understood version of the Arabic language amongst the [[Arab world]]. This is because Egyptian movies have been the most influential in the Arabic movie industry and is therefore the most widespread. As a result, most Arabic countries have grown up listening to the dialect and therefore have no trouble understanding it, even though they actually speak their own.

Originally the Egyptians wrote in hieroglyphics. At first the meaning of the hieroglyphics was unknown; until one day in the year 1799 Napoleón Bonaparte's soldiers dug up the Rosetta stone. The Rosetta Stone was found broken and incomplete. It features 14 lines of hieroglyphic script, 32 lines in Demotic and 53 lines of Ancient Greek.

[[Ancient Egypt]] saw a succession of thirty [[Dynasty|dynasties]] spanning three millennia. During this period, Egyptian culture underwent significant development in terms of [[Egyptian mythology|religion]], [[Art of ancient Egypt|arts]], [[Egyptian language|language]] and customs.

Egypt fell under [[Hyksos]] rule in the Middle [[Bronze Age]]. The native nobility managed to expel the conquerors by the [[Late Bronze Age]], thereby initiating the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. During this period, the Egyptian civilization rose to the status of an empire under Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]] of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]]. It remained a super-regional power throughout the [[Amarna Period]] as well as during the [[Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt|19th]] and [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th]] dynasties (the Ramesside Period), lasting into the Early [[Iron Age]].

The [[Bronze Age collapse]] that had afflicted the Mesopotamian empires reached Egypt with some delay, and it was only in the 11th century BC that the Empire declined, falling into the comparative obscurity of the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt]]. The [[Twenty-fifth dynasty of Egypt|25th dynasty]] of [[Nubian people|Nubian]] rulers was again briefly replaced by native nobility in the 7th century BC, and in 525 BC, Egypt fell under [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian rule]].

[[Alexander the Great]] was greeted as a liberator when he conquered Egypt in 332 BC. The [[Late Period of ancient Egypt]] is taken to end with his death in 323 BC. The [[Ptolemaic Egypt|Ptolemaic dynasty]] ruled Egypt from 305 BC to 30 BC and introduced [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenic]] culture to Egyptians. 4,000 [[Celts|Celtic]] mercenaries under Ptolemy II had even attempted an ambitious but doomed coup d'état around the year 270 BC.

Throughout the Pharaonic epoch (viz., from 2920 BC to 525 BC in [[conventional Egyptian chronology]]), [[divine kingship]] was the glue which held Egyptian society together. It was especially pronounced in the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] and [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and continued until the Roman conquest. The societal structure created by this system of government remained virtually unchanged up to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of the king was considerably weakened after the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th dynasty]]. The king in his role as Son of Ra was entrusted to maintain [[Ma'at#Ma'at as a principle|Ma'at]], the principle of truth, justice and order, and to enhance the country's agricultural economy by ensuring regular [[Flooding of the Nile|Nile floods]]. Ascendancy to the Egyptian throne reflected the myth of Horus who assumed kingship after he buried his murdered father [[Osiris]]. The king of Egypt, as a living personification of Horus, could claim the throne after burying his predecessor, who was typically his father. When the role of the king waned, the country became more susceptible to foreign influence and invasion.

The attention paid to the dead, and the veneration with which they were held, were one of the hallmarks of [[Ancient Egypt|ancient Egyptian society]]. Egyptians built tombs for their dead that were meant to last for eternity. This was most prominently expressed by the [[Great Pyramids]]. The ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] word for tomb ''{{transl|egy|pr nḥḥ}}'' means 'House of Eternity.' The Egyptians also celebrated life, as is shown by tomb reliefs and inscriptions, papyri and other sources depicting Egyptians farming, conducting trade expeditions, hunting, holding festivals, attending parties and receptions with their pet dogs, cats and monkeys, dancing and singing, enjoying food and drink, and playing games. The ancient Egyptians were also known for their engaging sense of humor, much like their modern descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maler der Grabkammer der Bildhauer Nebamun und Ipuki 005.jpg|thumb|300px|A boat scene, the tomb of Nebamun, [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]], Thebes.]]
Another important continuity during this period is the Egyptian attitude toward foreigners—those they considered not fortunate enough to be part of the community of ''rmṯ'' or "the people" (i.e., Egyptians.) This attitude was facilitated by the Egyptians' more frequent contact with other peoples during the New Kingdom, when Egypt expanded to an empire that also encompassed [[Nubia]] through [[Jebel Barkal]] and parts of the [[Levant]].

The Egyptian sense of superiority was given religious validation, as foreigners in the land of ''Ta-Meri'' (Egypt) were anathema to the maintenance of Maat—a view most clearly expressed by the [[Ipuwer papyrus|admonitions of Ipuwer]] in reaction to the chaotic events of the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]]. Foreigners in Egyptian texts were described in derogatory terms, e.g., 'wretched Asiatics' (Semites), 'vile Kushites' (Nubians), and 'Ionian dogs' (Greeks). Egyptian beliefs remained unchallenged when Egypt fell to the Hyksos, [[Assyria]]ns, [[Berber people|Libyans]], Persians and Greeks—their rulers assumed the role of the Egyptian Pharaoh and were often depicted praying to Egyptian gods.

The ancient Egyptians used a solar calendar that divided the year into 12 months of 30 days each, with five extra days added. The calendar revolved around the annual [[Nile]] Inundation (''akh.t''), the first of three seasons into which the year was divided. The other two were Winter and Summer, each lasting for four months. The modern Egyptian ''[[fellah]]in'' calculate the agricultural seasons, with the months still bearing their ancient names, in much the same manner.

The importance of the Nile in Egyptian life, ancient and modern, cannot be overemphasized. The rich alluvium carried by the Nile inundation were the basis of Egypt's formation as a society and a state. Regular inundations were a cause for celebration; low waters often meant famine and starvation. The ancient Egyptians personified the river flood as the god [[Hapy]] and dedicated a ''Hymn to the Nile'' to celebrate it. ''km.t'', the Black Land, was as [[Herodotus]] observed, "the gift of the river."

===Graeco-Roman period===

[[File:Fayum-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman-era portrait of an Egyptian mummy from the [[Fayum mummy portraits|Fayum collection]], ''c.'' AD 125 − AD 150]]

When Alexander died, a story began to circulate that [[Nectanebo II]] was Alexander's father. This made Alexander in the eyes of the Egyptians a legitimate heir to the native pharaohs.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; The new Ptolemaic rulers, however, exploited Egypt for their own benefit and a great social divide was created between Egyptians and Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, Jill. ''Coptic Egypt: History and Guide''. Cairo: American University in Cairo, 1997. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; The local priesthood continued to wield power as they had during the Dynastic age. Egyptians continued to practice their religion undisturbed and largely maintained their own separate communities from their foreign conquerors.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The language of administration became [[Greek language|Greek]], but the mass of the Egyptian population was [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]-speaking and concentrated in the countryside, while most Greeks lived in Alexandria and only few had any knowledge of Egyptian.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ptolemaic rulers all retained their Greek names and titles, but projected a public image of being Egyptian pharaohs. Much of this period's vernacular literature was composed in the [[Demotic (Egyptian)|demotic]] phase and script of the Egyptian language. It was focused on earlier stages of Egyptian history when Egyptians were independent and ruled by great native pharaohs such as [[Ramesses II]]. Prophetic writings circulated among Egyptians promising expulsion of the Greeks, and frequent revolts by the Egyptians took place throughout the Ptolemaic period.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; A revival in animal cults, the hallmark of the Predyanstic and Early Dyanstic periods, is said to have come about to fill a spiritual void as Egyptians became increasingly disillusioned and weary due to successive waves of foreign invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] annexed Egypt in 30 BC, the social structure created by the Greeks was largely retained, though the power of the Egyptian priesthood diminished. The Roman emperors lived abroad and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship as the Ptolemies had. The art of [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraiture]] flourished, but Egypt became further stratified with Romans at the apex of the social pyramid, Greeks and [[Jews]] occupied the middle stratum, while Egyptians, who constituted the vast majority, were at the bottom. Egyptians paid a poll tax at full rate, Greeks paid at half-rate and Roman citizens were exempt.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] advocated the expulsion of all ethnic Egyptians from the city of Alexandria, saying "genuine Egyptians can easily be recognized among the linen-weavers by their speech."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Alan K. Bowman ''Egypt after the Pharaohs, 332 BC − AD 642''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996. p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude lasted until AD 212 when Roman citizenship was finally granted to all the inhabitants of Egypt, though ethnic divisions remained largely entrenched.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans, like the Ptolemies, treated Egypt like their own private property, a land exploited for the benefit of a small foreign elite. The Egyptian peasants, pressed for maximum production to meet Roman quotas, suffered and fled to the desert.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The cult of [[Isis]], like those of [[Osiris]] and [[Serapis]], had been popular in Egypt and throughout the [[Roman Empire]] at the coming of Christianity, and continued to be the main competitor with Christianity in its early years. The main temple of Isis remained a major center of worship in Egypt until the reign of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Justinian I]] in the 6th century, when it was finally closed down. Egyptians, disaffected and weary after a series of foreign occupations, identified the story of the mother-goddess Isis protecting her child [[Horus]] with that of the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] and her son [[Jesus]] escaping the emperor [[Herod the Great|Herod]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, many sites believed to have been the resting places of the holy family during their sojourn in Egypt became sacred to the Egyptians. The visit of the holy family later circulated among Egyptian Christians as fulfillment of the Biblical prophecy "When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt" (Hosea 11:1). The feast of the coming of the Lord of Egypt on June 1 became an important part of Christian Egyptian tradition. According to tradition, Christianity was brought to Egypt by [[Saint Mark the Evangelist]] in the early 40s of the 1st century, under the reign of the Roman emperor [[Nero]]. The earliest converts were Jews residing in [[Alexandria]], a city which had by then become a center of culture and learning in the entire Mediterranean ''[[oikoumene]]''.

[[File:Coptic manuscript.jpg|thumb|300px|A Coptic-Arabic manuscript, [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period, AD 1249–50. Images depict [[Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane, the kiss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]], the arrest of Christ, his appearance before [[Caiaphas]], Peter's denial at cockcrow, Christ before [[Pilate]], and the baptism of Jesus in the [[Jordan River]].]]
St. Mark is said to have founded the Holy Apostolic See of Alexandria and to have become its first [[List of Coptic Popes|Patriarch]]. Within 50 years of St. Mark's arrival in Alexandria, a fragment of [[New Testament]] writings appeared in [[Oxyrhynchus]] (Bahnasa), which suggests that Christianity already began to spread south of Alexandria at an early date. By the mid-third century, a sizable number of Egyptians were persecuted by the Romans on account of having adopted the new Christian faith, beginning with the Edict of [[Decius]]. Christianity was tolerated in the Roman Empire until AD 284, when the Emperor [[Diocletian]] persecuted and put to death a great number of Christian Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Jankowski, p. 32"&gt;Jankowski, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

This event became a watershed in the history of Egyptian Christianity, marking the beginning of a distinct Egyptian or [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. It became known as the 'Era of the Martyrs' and is commemorated in the [[Coptic calendar]] in which dating of the years began with the start of Diocletian's reign. When Egyptians were persecuted by Diocletian, many retreated to the desert to seek relief. The practice precipitated the rise of [[monasticism]], for which the Egyptians, namely [[Anthony the Great|St. Antony]], [[Pachomius|St. Bakhum]], [[Saint Shenouda the Archimandrite|St. Shenouda]] and [[Saint Amun|St. Amun]], are credited as pioneers. By the end of the 4th century, it is estimated that the mass of the Egyptians had either embraced Christianity or were nominally Christian.&lt;ref name="Jankowski, p. 32"/&gt;

The Catachetical School of Alexandria was founded in the 3rd century by [[Pantaenus]], becoming a major school of Christian learning as well as science, mathematics and the humanities. The [[Psalms]] and part of the New Testament were translated at the school from Greek to Egyptian, which had already begun to be written in Greek letters with the addition of a number of demotic characters. This stage of the Egyptian language would later come to be known as [[Coptic language|Coptic]] along with its [[Coptic alphabet|alphabet]]. The third theologian to head the Catachetical School was a native Egyptian by the name of [[Origen]]. Origen was an outstanding theologian and one of the most influential [[Church Fathers]]. He traveled extensively to lecture in various churches around the world and has many important texts to his credit including the ''[[Hexapla]]'', an [[exegesis]] of various translations of the [[Old Testament|Hebrew Bible]].

At the threshold of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, the New Testament had been entirely translated into Coptic. But while Christianity continued to thrive in Egypt, the old pagan beliefs which had survived the test of time were facing mounting pressure. The Byzantine period was particularly brutal in its zeal to erase any traces of ancient Egyptian religion. Under emperor [[Theodosius I]], Christianity had already been proclaimed the religion of the Empire and all pagan cults were forbidden. When Egypt fell under the jurisdiction of [[Constantinople]] after the split of the Roman Empire, many ancient Egyptians temples were either destroyed or converted into monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the defining moments in the history of the Church in Egypt is a controversy that ensued over the nature of Jesus Christ which culminated in the final split of the Coptic Church from both the Byzantine and Roman Catholic Churches. The [[Council of Chalcedon]] convened in AD 451, signaling the Byzantine Empire's determination to assert its hegemony over Egypt. When it declared that Jesus Christ was of two natures embodied in Christ's person, the Egyptian reaction was swift, rejecting the decrees of the Council as incompatible with the [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] doctrine of Coptic Orthodoxy. The Copts' upholding of the Miaphysite doctrine against the pro-Chalcedonian Greek [[Melkite]]s had both theological and national implications. As [[Coptologist]] Jill Kamil notes, the position taken by the Egyptians "paved [the way] for the Coptic church to establish itself as a separate entity...No longer even spiritually linked with Constantinople, theologians began to write more in Coptic and less in Greek. [[Coptic art]] developed its own national character, and the Copts stood united against the imperial power."&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic period from Late antiquity to Middle Ages===
&lt;!-- [[File:Abdelbaset.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Abdul Basit 'Abd us-Samad|Qari Abdul Baset]], renowned Egyptian [[Quran]] reciter.]] --&gt;

[[File:Invitation-d'un-marriage-arab.jpg|thumb|right|En Route to an [[Arab Wedding]] or Katb el-Kitāb in Cairo, Egypt]]
Before the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the Byzantine Emperor [[Heraclius]] was able to reclaim the country after a brief Persian invasion in AD 616, and subsequently appointed [[Cyrus of Alexandria]], a Chalcedonian, as Patriarch. Cyrus was determined to convert the Egyptian Miaphysites by any means. He expelled Coptic monks and bishops from their monasteries and sees. Many died in the chaos, and the resentment of the Egyptians against their Byzantine conquerors reached a peak.&lt;ref&gt;Watterson, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the new religion of [[Islam]] was making headway in [[Arabia]], culminating in the [[Muslim conquests]] that took place following [[Muhammad]]'s Passing on. In AD 639, the Arab general [['Amr ibn al-'As]] marched into Egypt, facing off with the Byzantines in the [[Battle of Heliopolis]] that ended with the Byzantines' defeat. The relationship between the Greek Melkites and the Egyptian Copts had grown so bitter that most Egyptians did not put up heavy resistance against the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Kamil, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Muslim rulers moved the capital to [[Fustat]] and, through the 7th century, retained the existing Byzantine administrative structure with [[Greek language|Greek]] as its language. Native Egyptians filled administrative ranks and continued to worship freely so long as they paid the [[jizya]] poll tax, in addition to a [[kharaj|land tax]] that all Egyptians irrespective of religion also had to pay. The authority of the Miaphysite doctrine of the Coptic Church was for the first time nationally recognized.&lt;ref name="Watterson, p. 268"&gt;Watterson, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ya'qubi|al-Ya'qubi]], repeated revolts by Egyptian Christians against the Muslim Arabs took place in the 8th and 9th centuries under the reign of the [[Umayyad]]s and [[Abbasid]]s. The greatest was one in which disaffected Muslim Egyptians joined their Christian compatriots around AD 830 in an unsuccessful attempt to repel the Arabs.&lt;ref name="Watterson, p. 268"/&gt; The Egyptian Muslim historian Ibn Abd al-Hakam spoke harshly of the Abbasids—a reaction that according to Egyptologist Okasha El-Daly can be seen "within the context of the struggle between proud native Egyptians and the central Abbasid caliphate in Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, Okasha. ''Egyptology: The Missing Millennium''. London: UCL Press, 2005. p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of Islam that eventually took hold in Egypt was [[Sunni]], though very early in this period Egyptians began to blend their new faith with indigenous beliefs and practices that had survived through Coptic Christianity. Just as Egyptians had been pioneers in early [[monasticism]] so they were in the development of the mystical form of Islam, [[Sufism]].&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; Various Sufi [[tariqa|orders]] were founded in the 8th century and flourished until the present day. One of the earliest Egyptian Sufis was [[Dhul-Nun al-Misri]] (i.e., Dhul-Nun the Egyptian). He was born in [[Akhmim]] in AD 796 and achieved political and social leadership over the Egyptian people.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, P.J. ''The History of Modern Egypt''. 4th ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991. p. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Dhul-Nun was regarded as the Patron Saint of the Physicians and is credited with having introduced the concept of [[Gnosis]] into Islam, as well as of being able to decipher a number of hieroglyphic characters due to his knowledge of [[Coptic language|Coptic]].&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; He was keenly interested in ancient Egyptian sciences, and claimed to have received his knowledge of alchemy from Egyptian sources.&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Al Azhar1.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Azhar Mosque]] founded in AD 970 by the Fatimids]]
[[File:Egypt.LuxorTemple.04.jpg|thumb|[[Mosque of Abu Haggag]] built in the 11th century over the ruins of a pharaonic temple. The ancient Opet festival associated with this temple is mirrored in the present day festival of Abu-l Haggag celebrated similarly by boat processions through the streets of [[Luxor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hethert.org/opetfestival.htm Opet Festival] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503064301/http://www.hethert.org/opetfestival.htm |date=May 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the years to follow the Arab occupation of Egypt, a social hierarchy was created whereby Egyptians who converted to Islam acquired the status of [[mawali]] or "clients" to the ruling Arab elite, while those who remained Christian, the Copts, became [[dhimmis]]. In time the power of the Arabs waned throughout the [[Islamic Caliphate|Islamic Empire]] so that in the 10th century, the Turkish [[Ikhshidid dynasty|Ikhshids]] were able to take control of Egypt and made it an independent political unit from the rest of the empire.

Egyptians continued to live socially and politically separate from their foreign conquerors, but their rulers like the Ptolemies before them were able to stabilize the country and bring renewed economic prosperity. It was under the [[Shi'a Islam|Shiite]] [[Fatimid]]s from the 10th to the 12th centuries that Muslim Egyptian institutions began to take form along with the [[Egyptian Arabic|Egyptian dialect]] of Arabic, which was to eventually slowly supplant native Egyptian or Coptic as the spoken language.

[[Al-Azhar]] was founded in AD 970 in the new capital [[Cairo]], not very far from its ancient predecessor in Memphis. It became the preeminent Muslim center of learning in Egypt and by the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] period it had acquired a Sunni orientation. The Fatimids with some exceptions were known for their religious tolerance and their observance of local Muslim, Coptic and indigenous Egyptian festivals and customs. Under the Ayyubids, the country for the most part continued to prosper

The [[Mamluks of Egypt]] (AD 1258–1517)  as a whole were,  some of the most enlightened rulers of Egypt, not only in the arts and in providing for the welfare of their subjects, but also in many other ways, such as efficient organisation of law and order and postal services, and the building of canals, roads, bridges and aqueducts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aero-comlab.stanford.edu/jameson/world_history/A_Short_History_of_Egypt.pdf A Short History of Egypt – to about 1970 from University of Standford]
&lt;/ref&gt; Though turbulent, often treacherous and brutal in their feuds, and politically and economically inept, the later Mameluks maintained the splendour and artistic traditions of their predecessors. The reign of Kait Bey (1468-1496) was one of high achievement in architecture, showing great refinement of taste in the building of elegant tombs, mosques and palaces. It was a period in which learning flourished.

Their rule is generally {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} regarded as one under which Egyptians, Muslims and Copts, greatly suffered. By the 15th century most Egyptians had already been converted to Islam, while Coptic Christians were reduced to a minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09996|title=The genetics of East African populations: a Nilo-Saharan component in the African genetic landscape|first1=Begoña|last1=Dobon|first2=Hisham Y.|last2=Hassan|first3=Hafid|last3=Laayouni|first4=Pierre|last4=Luisi|first5=Isis|last5=Ricaño-Ponce|first6=Alexandra|last6=Zhernakova|first7=Cisca|last7=Wijmenga|first8=Hanan|last8=Tahir|first9=David|last9=Comas|first10=Mihai G.|last10=Netea|first11=Jaume|last11=Bertranpetit|date=28 May 2015|publisher=|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=5|issue=1|doi=10.1038/srep09996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The Mamluks were mainly ethnic [[Circassians]] and [[Turkish people|Turks]] who had been captured as slaves then recruited into the army fighting on behalf of the Islamic empire. Native Egyptians were not allowed to serve in the army until the reign of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohamed Ali]]. Historian James Jankwoski writes:{{quote|Ultimately, Mamluk rule rested on force. The chronicles of the period are replete with examples of Mamluk violence against the indigenous population of Egypt...From horseback, they simply terrorized those lesser breeds who crossed their paths. The sudden and arbitrary use of force by the government and its dominant military elite; frequent resort to cruelty to make a point; ingenious methods of torture employed both for exemplary purpose and to extract wealth from others: all these measures were routine in the Mamluk era. Egypt under the Mamluks was not a very secure place to live.&lt;ref&gt;''A Short History of Egypt'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ottoman period===
Egyptians under the [[Ottoman Turks]] from the 16th to the 18th centuries lived within a social hierarchy similar to that of the Mamluks, Arabs, Romans, Greeks and Persians before them. Native Egyptians applied the term ''atrak'' (Turks) indiscriminately to the Ottomans and Mamluks, who were at the top of the social pyramid, while Egyptians, most of whom were farmers, were at the bottom. Frequent revolts by the Egyptian peasantry against the Ottoman-Mamluk [[Bey]]s took place throughout the 18th century, particularly in Upper Egypt where the peasants at one point wrested control of the region and declared a separatist government.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The only segment of Egyptian society which appears to have retained a degree of power during this period were the Muslim '''ulama'' or religious scholars, who directed the religious and social affairs of the native Egyptian population and interceded on their behalf when dealing with the Turko-Circassian elite. It is also believed that during the time of Ottoman period of Egypt, native Egyptians were allowed and required to join the army for the first time since the Roman period of Egypt, particularly Copts who were civil servants at the time of Mohammed Ali Pasha.

{{quote|From the Egyptian side, literary works from both the Mamluk and Ottoman eras indicate that literate Egyptians had not totally submerged their identity within Islam, but retained an awareness of Egypt's distinctiveness as a uniquely fertile region of the Muslim world, as a land of great historical antiquity and splendor... At least for some Egyptians, 'the land of Egypt' (''{{transl|ar|al-diyar al-misriyya}}'') was an identifiable and emotionally meaningful entity within the larger Muslim polity of which it was now a province.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Modern history===
{{Main|History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|History of modern Egypt}}
[[File:Francois-Louis-Joseph Watteau 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Battle of the Pyramids]]'' by [[François-Louis-Joseph Watteau]], 1798–1799]]
[[File:Women in Egypt.jpg|thumb|Egyptian women in traditional dress]]
Modern Egyptian history is generally believed to begin with the [[Napoleon I of France#The Egyptian expedition of 1798–99|French expedition]] in Egypt led by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1798. The [[French people|French]] defeated a Mamluk-Ottoman army at the [[Battle of the Pyramids]], and soon they were able to seize control of the country.

The French occupation was short-lived, ending when [[British Empire|British]] troops drove out the French in 1801. Its impact on the social and cultural fabric of Egyptian society, however, was tremendous. The Egyptians were deeply hostile to the French, whom they viewed as yet another foreign occupation to be resisted. At the same time, the French expedition introduced Egyptians to the ideals of the [[French Revolution]] which were to have a significant influence on their own self-perception and realization of modern independence.

When Napoleon invited the Egyptian ''ulama'' to head a French-supervised government in Egypt, for some, it awakened a sense of nationalism and a patriotic desire for national independence from the [[Ottoman Turks|Turks]]. In addition, the French introduced the printing press in Egypt and published its first newspaper. The monumental catalogue of Egypt's ecology, society and economy, ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Égypte]]'', was written by scholars and scientists who accompanied the French army on their expedition.

The withdrawal of French forces from Egypt left a power vacuum that was filled after a period of political turmoil by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Mohammed Ali]], an Ottoman officer of [[Albanians|Albanian]] ethnicity. He rallied support among the Egyptians until he was elected by the native Muslim ''ulama'' as governor of Egypt. Mohammed Ali is credited for having undertaken a massive campaign of public works, including irrigation projects, agricultural reforms and the cultivation of cash crops (notably [[cotton]], [[rice]] and [[sugarcane|sugar-cane]]), increased industrialization, and a new educational system—the results of which are felt to this day.&lt;ref name="Jankowskil, p. 74"&gt;Jankowskil, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to consolidate his power in Egypt, Mohammed Ali worked to eliminate the Turko-Circassian domination of administrative and army posts. For the first time since the Roman period, native Egyptians filled the junior ranks of the country's army. The army would later conduct military expeditions in the [[Levant]], [[Sudan]] and against the [[Wahhabism|Wahabis]] in [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name="Jankowskil, p. 74"/&gt; Many Egyptians student missions were sent to Europe in the early 19th century to study at European universities and acquire technical skills such as printing, shipbuilding and modern military techniques. One of these students, whose name was Rifa'a et-Tahtawy, was the first in a long line of intellectuals that started the modern Egyptian Renaissance.

====Nationalism====
[[File:Tahtawi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]], 1801–1873, laid the groundwork for the modern Egyptian Renaissance.]]
The period between 1860–1940 was characterized by an Egyptian ''nahda'', renaissance or rebirth. It is best known for the renewed interest in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquity]] and the cultural achievements that were inspired by it. Along with this interest came an indigenous, Egypt-centered orientation, particularly among the Egyptian intelligentsia that would affect Egypt's autonomous development as a sovereign and independent nation-state.&lt;ref name="Vatikiotis, p. 115-16"&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 115–16&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Egyptian renaissance intellectual was [[Rifa'a el-Tahtawi]]. In 1831, Tahtawi undertook a career in journalism, education and translation. Three of his published volumes were works of political and moral [[philosophy]]. In them he introduces his students to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideas such as [[secularism|secular]] authority and political rights and liberty; his ideas regarding how a modern civilized society ought to be and what constituted by extension a civilized or "good Egyptian"; and his ideas on public interest and public good.&lt;ref name="Vatikiotis, p. 115-16"/&gt;

Tahtawi was instrumental in sparking indigenous interest in Egypt's ancient heritage. He composed a number of poems in praise of Egypt and wrote two other general histories of the country. He also co-founded with his contemporary [[Ali Pasha Mubarak|Ali Mubarak]], the architect of the modern Egyptian school system, a native [[Egyptology]] school that looked for inspiration to medieval Egyptian scholars like [[Suyuti]] and [[Al-Maqrizi|Maqrizi]], who studied ancient Egyptian history, language and antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;El-Daly, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Tahtawi encouraged his compatriots to invite Europeans to come and teach the modern sciences in Egypt, drawing on the example of Pharaoh [[Psammetichus I|Psamtek I]] who had enlisted the [[Greeks]]' help in organizing the Egyptian army.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Among Mohammed Ali's successors, the most influential was [[Isma'il Pasha]] who became [[khedive]] in 1863. Ismail's reign witnessed the growth of the army, major education reforms, the founding of the [[Egyptian Museum]] and the [[Khedivial Opera House|Royal Opera House]], the rise of an independent political press, a flourishing of the arts, and the inauguration of the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1866, the Assembly of Delegates was founded to serve as an advisory body for the government. Its members were elected from across Egypt, including villages, which meant that native Egyptians came to exert increasing political and economic influence over their country.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Several generations of Egyptians exposed to the ideas of [[constitutionalism]] made up the emerging intellectual and political milieu that slowly filled the ranks of the government, the army and institutions which had long been dominated by an aristocracy of Turks, Greeks, [[Circassians]] and [[Armenians]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Ismail's massive modernization campaign, however, left Egypt indebted to European powers, leading to increased European meddling in local affairs. This led to the formation of secret groups made up of Egyptian notables, ministers, journalists and army officers organized across the country to oppose the increasing European influence.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

When the British deposed of Ismail and installed his son [[Tewfik Pasha|Tawfik]], the now Egyptian-dominated army reacted violently, staging a [[Urabi Revolt|revolt]] led by Minister of War [[Ahmed Urabi]], self-styled el-Masri ('the Egyptian'), against the Khedive, the Turko-Circassian elite, and the European stronghold. The revolt was a [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir|military failure]] and [[British Empire|British]] forces occupied Egypt in 1882. Technically, Egypt was still part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] with the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|Mohammed Ali family]] ruling the country, though now with British supervision and according to British directives. The Egyptian army was disbanded and a smaller army commanded by British officers was installed in its place.

====Liberal age====
{{Main|Liberalism in Egypt}}
[[File:Mustafa Kamil.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] (1874−1908), an anti-colonial nationalist famous for coining the phrase, "If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one".]]
Egyptian self-government, education, and the continued plight of Egypt's peasant majority deteriorated most significantly under British occupation. Slowly, an organized national movement for independence began to form. In its beginnings, it took the form of an Azhar-led religious reform movement that was more concerned with the social conditions of Egyptian society. It gathered momentum between 1882 and 1906, ultimately leading to a resentment against European occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh [[Muhammad Abduh]], the son of a Delta farmer who was briefly exiled for his participation in the Urabi revolt and a future Azhar [[Mufti]], was its most notable advocate. Abduh called for a reform of Egyptian Muslim society and formulated the [[modernism|modernist]] interpretations of [[Islam]] that took hold among younger generations of Egyptians. Among these were [[Mustafa Kamil Pasha|Mustafa Kamil]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], the architects of modern Egyptian nationalism. Mustafa Kamil had been a student activist in the 1890s involved in the creation of a secret nationalist society that called for British evacuation from Egypt. He was famous for coining the popular expression, "If I had not been an Egyptian, I would have wished to become one."

Egyptian nationalist sentiment reached a high point after the 1906 [[Dinshaway Incident]], when following an altercation between a group of British soldiers and Egyptian farmers, four of the farmers were hanged while others were condemned to public flogging. Dinshaway, a watershed in the history of Egyptian anti-[[colonialism|colonial]] resistance, galvanized Egyptian opposition against the British, culminating in the founding of the first two political parties in Egypt: the secular, liberal ''Umma'' (the Nation, 1907) headed by [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], and the more radical, pro-Islamic ''Watani'' Party (National Party, 1908) headed by Mustafa Kamil. Lutfi was born to a family of farmers in the Delta province of [[Ad Daqahliyah|Daqahliya]] in 1872. He was educated at al-Azhar where he attended lectures by Mohammed Abduh. Abduh came to have a profound influence on Lutfi's reformist thinking in later years. In 1907, he founded the Umma Party newspaper, el-Garida, whose statement of purpose read: "El-Garida is a purely Egyptian party which aims to defend Egyptian interests of all kinds."&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Vatikiotis, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the People and National parties came to dominate Egyptian politics until World War I, but the new leaders of the national movement for independence following four arduous years of war (in which Great Britain declared Egypt a British [[protectorate]]) were closer to the secular, liberal principles of [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]] and the People's Party. Prominent among these was [[Saad Zaghlul]] who led the new movement through the [[Wafd Party]]. Saad Zaghlul held several ministerial positions before he was elected to the Legislative Assembly and organized a mass movement demanding an end to the British Protectorate. He garnered such massive popularity among the Egyptian people that he came to be known as 'Father of the Egyptians'. When on March 8, 1919 the British arrested Zaghlul and his associates and exiled them to [[Malta]], the Egyptian people staged their [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919|first modern revolution]]. Demonstrations and strikes across Egypt became such a daily occurrence that normal life was brought to a halt.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wafd Party drafted a [[1923 Constitution of Egypt|new Constitution in 1923]] based on a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] representative system. Saad Zaghlul became the first popularly elected Prime Minister of Egypt in 1924. Egyptian independence at this stage was provisional, as British forces continued to be physically present on Egyptian soil. In 1936, the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936|Anglo-Egyptian Treaty]] was concluded. New forces that came to prominence were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and the radical [[Misr El-Fatah (Young Egypt) Party|Young Egypt Party]]. In 1920, [[Banque Misr]] (Bank of Egypt) was founded by [[Talaat Pasha Harb]] as "an Egyptian bank for Egyptians only",&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Jankowski p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; which restricted shareholding to native Egyptians and helped finance various new Egyptian-owned businesses.

[[File:Farouk family official.jpg|thumb|[[King Farouk I]], [[Farida of Egypt|Queen Farida]] and their first-born daughter [[Princess Farial of Egypt|Princess Ferial]] c. 1940.]]
Under the parliamentary monarchy, Egypt reached the peak of its modern intellectual Renaissance that was started by Rifa'a el-Tahtawy nearly a century earlier. Among those who set the intellectual tone of a newly independent Egypt, in addition to [[Muhammad Abduh]] and [[Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed]], were [[Qasim Amin]], [[Muhammad Husayn Haykal]], [[Taha Hussein]], [[Abbas Al-Akkad|Abbas el-'Akkad]], [[Tawfiq al-Hakeem|Tawfiq el-Hakeem]], and [[Salama Moussa]]. They delineated a liberal outlook for their country expressed as a commitment to individual freedom, [[secularism]], an [[evolution]]ary view of the world and faith in science to bring progress to human society.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; This period was looked upon with fondness by future generations of Egyptians as a [[Golden Age]] of Egyptian liberalism, openness, and an Egypt-centered attitude that put the country's interests center stage.

When Egyptian novelist and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate [[Naguib Mahfouz]] died in 2006, many Egyptians felt that perhaps the last of the Greats of Egypt's golden age had died. In his dialogues with close associate and journalist Mohamed Salmawy, published as ''Mon Égypte'', Mahfouz had this to say:

{{quote|Egypt is not just a piece of land. Egypt is the inventor of civilisation ... The strange thing is that this country of great history and unsurpassed civilisation is nothing but a thin strip along the banks of the Nile ... This thin strip of land created moral values, launched the concept of monotheism, developed arts, invented science and gave the world a stunning administration. These factors enabled the Egyptians to survive while other cultures and nations withered and died ... Throughout history Egyptians have felt that their mission is to tend to life. They were proud to turn the land green, to make it blossom with life. The other thing is that Egyptians invented morality long before the major religions appeared on earth. Morality is not just a system for control but a protection against chaos and death ... Egypt gave Islam a new voice. It didn't change the basic tenets of Islam, but its cultural weight gave Islam a new voice, one it didn't have back in Arabia. Egypt embraced an Islam that was moderate, tolerant and non-extremist. Egyptians are very pious, but they know how to mix piety with joy, just as their ancestors did centuries ago. Egyptians celebrate religious occasions with flair. For them, religious festivals and the month of Ramadan are occasions to celebrate life.&lt;ref&gt;Salmawy, Mohamed.

[[File:Tahrir Square - February 10, 2011.png|thumb|Over 2 million Egyptians protesting in Tahrir Square]]

Increased involvement by [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] in parliamentary affairs, government corruption, and the widening gap between the country's rich and poor led to the eventual toppling of the monarchy and the dissolution of the parliament through a ''[[coup d'état]]'' by a group of [[Free Officers Movement (Egypt)|army officers]] in 1952. The Egyptian Republic was declared on June 18, 1953 with General [[Muhammad Naguib]] as the first President of the Republic. After Naguib was forced to resign in 1954 and later put under house arrest by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], the real architect of the 1952 movement, mass protests by Egyptians erupted against the forced resignation of what became a popular symbol of the new regime.&lt;ref&gt;Jankowski, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser assumed [[Political power|power]] as President and began a [[nationalization]] process that initially had profound effects on the socioeconomic strata of Egyptian society. According to one historian, "Egypt had, for the first time since 343 BC, been ruled not by a Macedonian Greek, nor a Roman, nor an Arab, nor a Turk, but by an Egyptian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bm1YdwLQ3pYC&amp;pg=PA294 |title=Watterson, p. 294 |publisher=Books.google.ch |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser nationalized the [[Suez Canal]] leading to the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. Egypt became increasingly involved in regional affairs until three years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War]], in which Egypt lost the [[Sinai peninsula|Sinai]] to [[Israel]], Nasser died and was succeeded by [[Anwar Sadat]]. Sadat revived an ''Egypt Above All'' orientation, switched Egypt's [[Cold War]] allegiance from the Soviet Union to the United States, expelling Soviet advisors in 1972, and launched the [[Infitah]] economic reform policy. Like his predecessor, he also clamped down on religious and leftist opposition alike.

Egyptians fought one last time in the 1973 October War in an attempt to liberate Egyptian territories captured by Israel six years earlier. The October War presented Sadat with a political victory that later allowed him to regain the Sinai. In 1977, Sadat made a historic visit to Israel leading to the signing of the 1978 [[Camp David Accords|peace treaty]], which was supported by the vast majority of Egyptians,&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, p. 443&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange for the complete Israeli withdrawal from Sinai. Sadat was [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|assassinated]] in [[Cairo]] by members of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] in 1981, and was succeeded by [[Hosni Mubarak]].

Hosni Mubarak was the president from 14 October 1981 to 11 February 2011, when he resigned under pressure of [[2011 Egyptian protests|popular protest]]. Although power was ostensibly organized under a [[Multi-party system|multi-party]] [[semi-presidential system]], in practice it rested almost solely with the president. In late February 2005, for the first time since the 1952 coup d'état, the Egyptian people had an apparent chance to elect a leader from a list of various candidates, most prominently [[Ayman Nour]]. Most Egyptians were skeptical about the process of [[democratization]] and feared that power might ultimately be transferred to the president's first son, [[Gamal Mubarak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/africa/egyptians-stage-protest-over-call-for-mubarak-s-son-to-be-president-1.485475|title=Egyptians stage protest over call for Mubarak's son to be president}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the [[Kefaya|Egyptian Movement for Change]] or simply ''Kefaya'' (Arabic for "Enough!") was founded as a grassroots mobilization of Egyptians seeking a return to democracy, a transparent government and greater equality and freedom.

After the resignation of Hosni Mubarak presidential powers were transferred to the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], who relinquished power on 30 June 2012 when Mohamed Morsi became the first democratically elected head of state in Egyptian history. He was ousted in a [[June 2013 Egyptian protests|revolution]] a year after and is on trial.

In the presidential elections on 26–28 May 2014, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi won in a landslide, capturing 22 million of the nearly 23 million votes counted.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Egypt}}
{{See also|Ancient Egypt}}
Egyptian culture boasts five millennia of recorded history. Ancient Egypt was among the earliest and greatest civilizations during which the Egyptians maintained a strikingly complex and stable culture that influenced later cultures of Europe, the [[Near East]] and Africa. After the Pharaonic era, the Egyptians themselves came under the influence of [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenism]], [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christianity]] and [[Muslim culture|Islamic]] culture. Today, many aspects of ancient Egyptian culture exist in interaction with newer elements, including the influence of modern [[Western culture]], itself influenced by Ancient Egypt.

==Surnames==
[[File:Zangaki. 0263. Chech arab.jpg|thumb|An Egyptian elder, 1860s]] 
Today, Egyptians carry names that have Egyptian, Arabic, Turkish, and Greek origins (especially Coptic ones) among others. The concept of a [[surname]] is lacking in Egypt. Rather, Egyptians tend to carry their father's name as their first middle name, and stop at the 2nd or 3rd first name, which thus becomes one's surname. In this manner, surnames continuously change with generations, as first names of 4th or 5th generations get dropped.
[[File:Charmeur des serpents 1860s.jpg|thumb|A serpent charmer in Egypt, 1860s]]

It is not entirely unusual for families of Egyptian origin (especially Coptic ones) to have names or family names beginning with the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] masculine possessive pronoun ''pa'' (generally ''ba'' in Arabic, which lost the phoneme {{IPA|/p/}} in the course of developing from [[Proto-Semitic]]). For example, Bayoumi (variations: Baioumi, Bayoumi, Baioumy) "of Fayyoum", Fayyoum meaning "of the big water (yom)", Basyouni (of [[Aswan]]), Bashandi, Bakhoum ("the eagle"), Bekhit, Bahur ("of [[Horus]]") and Banoub ("of [[Anubis]]").

The name Shenouda, which is very common among [[Copt]]s, means "child of God". Hence, names and many [[toponym]]s may end with ''-nouda'', ''-noudi'' or ''-nuti'', which means ''Of God'' in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] and [[Coptic language|Coptic]]. In addition, Egyptian families often derive their name from places in Egypt, such as Minyawi from [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]] and [[Suyuti]] from [[Asyut]]; or from one of the local [[Sufi]] orders such as el-Shazli and el-Sawy. More examples of prominent surnames are [[Qozman]] and [[Habib]].

With the adoption of Christianity and eventually Islam, Egyptians began to take on names associated with these religions. Many Egyptian surnames also became [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] and [[Arabization|Arabized]], meaning they were altered to sound [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. This was done by the addition of the Greek suffix ''-ios'' to Egyptian names; for example, Pakhom to Pakhomios; or by adding the Arabic definite article ''el'' to names such as Baymoui to el-Bayoumi.

Names starting with the Egyptian affix ''pu'' ("of the place of") were sometimes Arabized to ''abu'' ("father of"); for example, [[Busiri]] ("of the place of [[Osiris]]") occasionally became [[Abusir]] and al-Busiri. Some people might also have surnames like el-Shamy ("the Levantine") indicating a possible Levantine origin, or Dewidar indicating an Ottoman-Mamluk remnant. Conversely, some Levantines might carry the surname el-Masri ("the Egyptian") suggesting a possible Egyptian extraction. The Egyptian peasantry, the fellahin, are more likely to retain indigenous names given their relative isolation throughout the Egyptian people's history.

With [[French people|French]] influence, names like [[Mounier]], [[Pierre]], and many others became common, particularly in the Christian community.

==Genetic history==
{{main|Population history of Egypt}}
Beginning in the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]], some differences between the populations of Upper and Lower Egypt were ascertained through their skeletal remains, suggesting a gradual [[Cline (population genetics)|clinal]] pattern north to south.&lt;ref&gt;Batrawi A (1945).

[[File:Rammumy.jpg|thumb|150px|The mummy of [[Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt|19th dynasty]] King [[Ramesses II]].]]

When Lower and Upper Egypt were unified ''c''. 3200 BC, the distinction began to blur, resulting in a more homogeneous population in Egypt, though the distinction remains true to some degree to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2799339 | last1 = Berry | first1 = AC | last2 = Berry | first2 = RJ | last3 = Ucko | first3 = PJ |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1967 | title = Genetical change in ancient Egypt | jstor = 2799339| journal = Man | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 551–568 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330360603 | last1 = Brace | first1 = CL | last2 = Tracer | first2 = DP | last3 = Yaroch | first3 = LA | last4 = Robb | first4 = J | last5 = Brandt | first5 = K | last6 = Nelson | first6 = AR |name-list-format=vanc | year = 1993 | title = Clines and clusters versus "race:" a test in ancient Egypt and the case of a death on the Nile | journal = Yearbook of Physical Anthropology | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 1–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Irish JD | title=Who were the ancient Egyptians?

Kittles. ''The Persistence of Racial Thinking and the Myth of Racial Divergence''. ''American Anthropologist'' Vol. 99, No. 3 (Sep., 1997), pp. 534–544&lt;/ref&gt;

Keita describes the northern and southern patterns of the early [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period as "northern-Egyptian-Maghreb" and "tropical African variant" (overlapping with [[Nubia]]/[[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]]) respectively. He shows that a progressive change in Upper Egypt toward the northern Egyptian pattern takes place through the predynastic period. The southern pattern continues to predominate in [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], Upper Egypt by the [[First dynasty of Egypt|First Dynasty]], but "lower Egyptian, [[Maghreb]]ian, and [[Genetic history of Europe|European]] patterns are observed also, thus making for great diversity."&lt;ref&gt;Keita 1992, p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of noted physical anthropologists conducted [[craniofacial]] studies of Egyptian skeletal remains and concluded similarly that "the Egyptians have been in place since back in the Pleistocene and have been largely unaffected by either invasions or migrations. As others have noted, Egyptians are Egyptians, and they were so in the past as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330360603| title = Clines and clusters versus "Race:" a test in ancient Egypt and the case of a death on the Nile| year = 1993| last1 = Brace | first1 = C.

[[genetic genealogy|Genetic]] analysis of modern Egyptians reveals that they have [[Haplogroup#Y chromosome DNA haplogroups|paternal]] [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineages]] common to indigenous North-East African populations primarily  and to [[Near East]]ern peoples to a lesser extent—these lineages would have spread during the [[Neolithic]] and were maintained by the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Arredi B, Poloni E, Paracchini S, Zerjal T, Fathallah D, Makrelouf M, Pascali V, Novelletto A, Tyler-Smith C | title=A Predominantly Neolithic Origin for Y-Chromosomal DNA Variation in North Africa | journal=Am J Hum Genet | volume=75 | issue=2 | pages=338–45 | year=2004 | doi = 10.1086/423147 | pmc=1216069 |  pmid=15202071}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Manni F, Leonardi P, Barakat A, Rouba H, Heyer E, Klintschar M, McElreavey K, Quintana-Murci L | title=Y-chromosome analysis in Egypt suggests a genetic regional continuity in Northeastern Africa | journal=[[Hum Biol]]| volume=74 | issue=5 | pages=645–58 | year=2002 | pmid=12495079 | doi = 10.1353/hub.2002.0054}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[University of Chicago]] Egyptologist [[Frank Yurco]] suggested a historical, regional and ethnolinguistic continuity, asserting that "the mummies and skeletons of ancient Egyptians indicate they were Africans of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] ethnic grouping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yurco|first1=Frank|title=Were the Ancient Egyptians Black or White?|journal=BAR Magazine|date=Sep–Oct 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; He writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Certainly there was some foreign admixture [in Egypt], but basically a homogeneous African population had lived in the Nile Valley from ancient to modern times... [the] [[Badari|Badarian people]], who developed the earliest Predynastic Egyptian culture, already exhibited the mix of North African and Sub-Saharan physical traits that have typified Egyptians ever since (Hassan 1985; Yurco 1989; Trigger 1978; Keita 1990; Brace et al., this volume)... The peoples of Egypt, the Sudan, and much of East Africa, Ethiopia and Somalia are now generally regarded as a [Nile Valley] continuity, with widely ranging physical features (complexions light to dark, various hair and craniofacial types) but with powerful common cultural traits, including cattle pastoralist traditions (Trigger 1978; Bard, Snowden, this volume). Language research suggests that this Saharan-[Nile Valley] population became speakers of the Afro-Asiatic languages... Semitic was evidently spoken by Saharans who crossed the Red Sea into Arabia and became ancestors of the Semitic speakers there, possibly around 7000 BC... In summary we may say that Egypt was a distinct Afro-Asiatic African culture rooted in the Nile Valley and on the Sahara."&lt;ref&gt;Frank Yurco, "An Egyptological Review" in Mary R. Lefkowitz and Guy MacLean Rogers, eds. ''Black Athena Revisited''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1996. p. 62-100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 2006 [[bioarchaeology|bioarchaeological]] study on the dental [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] of [[ancient Egyptians]] by Prof. Joel Irish shows dental traits characteristic of indigenous North Africans and to a lesser extent [[Southwest Asia]]n and southern European populations. Among the samples included in the study is skeletal material from the [[commons:Fayum mummy portraits|Hawara tombs of Fayum]], which clustered very closely with the [[Badarian]] series of the [[Predynastic Egypt|predynastic]] period. All the samples, particularly those of the Dynastic period, were significantly divergent from a neolithic West Saharan sample from Lower Nubia. Biological continuity was also found intact from the dynastic to the post-pharaonic periods. According to Irish:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Egyptian] samples [996 mummies] exhibit morphologically simple, mass-reduced [[dentition]]s that are similar to those in populations from greater North Africa (Irish, 1993, 1998a–c, 2000) and, to a lesser extent, western Asia and Europe (Turner, 1985a; Turner and Markowitz, 1990; Roler, 1992; Lipschultz, 1996; Irish, 1998a). Similar craniofacial measurements among samples from these regions were reported as well (Brace et al., 1993)... an inspection of MMD values reveals no evidence of increasing [[phenetic]] distance between samples from the first and second halves of this almost 3,000-year-long period. For example, phenetic distances between First-Second Dynasty Abydos and samples from Fourth Dynasty Saqqara (MMD ¼ 0.050), 11–12th Dynasty Thebes (0.000), 12th Dynasty Lisht (0.072), 19th Dynasty Qurneh (0.053), and 26th–30th Dynasty Giza (0.027) do not exhibit a directional increase through time... Thus, despite increasing foreign influence after the Second Intermediate Period, not only did Egyptian culture remain intact (Lloyd, 2000a), but the people themselves, as represented by the dental samples, appear biologically constant as well... Gebel Ramlah [Neolithic Nubian/Western Desert sample] is, in fact, significantly different from [[Badari]] based on the 22-trait MMD (Table 4). For that matter, the Neolithic Western Desert sample is significantly different from all others [but] is closest to predynastic and early dynastic samples.&lt;ref&gt;Irish pp. 10–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Genrikh Samoilovich Lyushkov''' ({{lang-ru|Генрих Самойлович Люшков}}; 1900 &amp;ndash; disappeared August 1945) was an officer in the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[secret police]] and its highest-ranking [[defector]]. His subsequent disappearance has been subject to controversy and speculation by journalists and scholars.

==Early life==
Lyushkov was born in [[Odessa]] in the [[Russian Empire]] in 1900. His [[Jews|Jewish]] father supported him and his siblings as a tailor. He began his education in 1908 in a state-owned, six-classroom school, continuing there until 1915. While in school, he was influenced by his brother (a member of the [[Bolshevik]] underground) to join the [[Bolshevik Party]] and take part in the [[Russian Revolution]] several years later.

In April 1919, he received political training in [[Kiev]] for the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]]. During this time, the [[Russian Civil War]] broke out and after his graduation in September of that year, Lyushkov was assigned to the [[Bolshevik]] 14th Army for political work, where he saw combat against [[Poland|Poles]] and the [[White movement|White Russian]] forces of [[Anton Denikin]]. By then, he was a fully-fledged [[Commissar#Political commissar|political commissar]] and had received the [[Order of the Red Banner]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=407}}&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt;

==Secret police==
In November 1920, he joined the [[Cheka]] of [[Odessa]], which became known for its ruthlessness.&lt;ref name="Berkman" /&gt; He also served in [[Moscow]] and [[Ukraine]]. When the Cheka was disbanded and reformed into the [[State Political Directorate|GPU]] (the Государственное политическое управление НКВД РСФСР or "State Political Directorate"), Lyushkov rose even further. Around 1930,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}} he carried out an [[industrial espionage]] assignment in [[Germany]], where he monitored activities within the [[Junkers (Aircraft)|Junkers]] aviation company, bringing him the favour of [[Joseph Stalin]]. This success led to his working again within the USSR, now as a member of the [[NKVD]] (the Народный комиссариат внутренних дел or "People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs"). He was quickly transferred to preferential positions such as his posting as the NKVD chief in the [[Sea of Azov]]-[[Black Sea]] region{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}} as well as being awarded the [[Order of Lenin]] "for exemplary performance of tasks of the Party and government."&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt; He was also made a deputy of the [[Supreme Soviet]] and a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]].

During the time of the [[Moscow Trials]], he was the one who led the interrogations of [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Kamenev]].&lt;ref name="Medvedev" /&gt; Later, he earned a reputation as "an arrogant, arbitrary and sadistic bully...."{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}} On 31 July 1937, he received his final posting, as the NKVD chief in the [[Russian Far East]], where he had direct command over "20,000&amp;ndash;30,000 élite NKVD troops."{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=409}}

When he was given the post, he was, according to a later interview with Japanese military officials, given personal orders to aid in the elimination of specific officials as a part of the [[Great Purge]]: [[Vsevolod Balitsky]] (the former [[NKVD]] chief in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]], whom Lyushkov was replacing), [[Vasily Blyukher]] (a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]]), and A. I. Lapin (the Far East Air Corps Commander). Balitsky, Blyukher, and Lapin all fell victim to the Great Purge. Balitsky's arrest and execution resulted from evidence gathered by Lyushkov. Blyukher's arrest and subsequent death resulted from blame being assigned to him for Lyushkov's defection. Lapin committed suicide while imprisoned.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=408}}

Prompted by his Japanese interrogators, Lyushkov gave one of the earliest explanations of the circumstances of the [[Great Purge]], arguing that he had been merely appeasing Stalin and that he had no choice but to carry out his orders. Lyushkov, immediately upon arriving in [[Khabarovsk]], saw that Balitsky had been arrested and sent to Moscow for trial and execution.

However, his time in the post proved to be short. When the Great Purge was near its peak and NKVD boss [[Nikolai Yezhov]] was gradually losing power, Lyushkov received a summons to return to Moscow, but strongly suspected that it would mean his own arrest and execution, since his own two predecessors in his post, [[Terenty Deribas]] and Balitsky, had both been purged. Balitsky had been convicted on information from Lyushkov himself, whom he had considered a friend.&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt;

By then, Lyushkov had been promoted to "third-rank commissar of state security" (комиссар госбезопасности 3-го ранга) or "Commissar 3rd Class", the approximate equivalent of a [[major-general]] in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=405}}

==Defection==
In preparation for his defection, Lyushkov arranged for his Jewish wife, Inna, to leave the country with his eleven-year-old daughter, for the daughter to receive medical treatment in [[Poland]]. The plan was for Inna to embed a secret codeword into a [[telegram]], which would signal to Lyushkov that it was safe for him to leave the [[Soviet Union]].

Under unknown circumstances, however, Inna and her daughter were captured. Though the daughter's fate remains unknown, Inna was kept at the [[Lubyanka prison]] and tortured for information throughout late 1938 before eventually being executed.&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt; Other members of Lyushkov's family were arrested and imprisoned in Siberian [[gulag]]s.&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt; While his mother and brother were both killed, his sister survived her imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt;

On 13 June 1938, Lyushkov defected from the [[Soviet Union]] by crossing the border into [[Manchukuo]] with valuable secret documents about the Soviet military strength in the region, which was much greater than the Japanese had realised. He was the highest-ranking secret police official to defect; he also had the greatest inside knowledge about the purges within the Soviet [[Red Army]] because of his own participation in carrying them out.

His defection was initially kept a state secret by [[Japan]], but the revelation of his defection was judged to have a high [[propaganda]] value,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=411}} so the decision was made to release the news to the world. A press conference was arranged at a [[Tokyo]] hotel on 13 July,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=411}} a month after Lyushkov had defected. He "categorically denied Moscow's allegation that he was an imposter"{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=411}} but some news agencies, such as the ''[[New York Times]]'' wondered if he was telling the truth.

During subsequent interviews and interactions with Japanese military personnel, Lyushkov adopted an anti-[[Stalinism|Stalinist]] position.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=412}} However, his professed political views remained [[socialism|socialistic]] in nature according to the recollections of some Japanese intelligence officers, with Lyushkov calling himself a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyite]],{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}} but some Japanese officers believed that he had later become a [[Liberal socialism|liberal communist]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=414}} Though Lyushkov was anti-Stalinist, he was resistant to the idea of creating a new regime led by Russian [[emigrants|émigrés]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=414}} He was, however, willing to include them in a proposed plan for the assassination of Stalin.

A resistance group of Russian emigrants would travel across the [[Turkey|Turkish]]-Soviet border when Stalin would travel south to a resort in [[Sochi]], which he had visited previously to swim in the [[Matsesta River]]. Lyushkov's intimate knowledge of NKVD procedures and the way Stalin's guard detail would be organised encouraged the Japanese to support the plan. However, a Soviet agent had infiltrated the group of Russian exiles and foiled the plan, which was considered the only serious attempt to assassinate Stalin.&lt;ref name="Kuksin" /&gt;

Lyushkov was able to detail the strength of the [[Red Army]] in the [[Russian Far East|Far East]], [[Siberia]] and [[Ukraine]], simultaneously providing Soviet military radio codes. He was considered highly intelligent and dedicated,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=412}} producing great volumes of written material,{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}} but there was some uncertainty about his ability to provide useful information specific to military operations.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=414}}

As he spent more time in Japan, his hard work impressed the Japanese intelligence officers with whom he had been assigned to work. The staff of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] had concerns, however, about his psychological state, especially pertaining to the status of his wife and daughter, about whom he had heard no news since his defection. After a failed search by Japanese intelligence agents for his family, a plan to both pacify and "domesticate"{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}} Lyushkov was decided upon: he would be paired with a woman, both to distract him from the question of his family's status and to keep him rooted in Japan. An eventual match was found after Lyushkov refused several [[White émigré]] women.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=413}}

At some point, he began to make plans to travel to the [[United States]] and contacted an American publisher about a possible autobiography that he would write. He had concerns that he might be prevented from leaving Japan and went as far as to negotiate a written safe-conduct guarantee.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=417}}

== Disappearance ==
After Germany's capitulation, Lyushkov was sent on 20 July 1945 to work for the Japanese [[Kwantung Army]]'s Special Intelligence authorities in the puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=418}} On 9 August 1945, the [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria]] commenced and Lyushkov vanished in the confusion of the assault, where he was reportedly last seen in a crowd at a [[Dalian|Dairen]] train station.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=418}}

Other theories hold that he was captured by the [[Red Army]] or that he was killed on the orders of a Japanese Special Intelligence officer to prevent him from giving away Japanese military secrets to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Coox|1968|p=418}}&lt;ref name="Memo.ru" /&gt; Lyushkov's ultimate fate remains unknown.

==Background==

===Historical===
{{Main article|History of Iraq|Saddam Hussein}}
In 1957, at the age of 20, Saddam Hussein joined the nascent [[Ba'ath Party]], which was founded on a [[socialism|socialist]] form of [[Pan-Arabism]]. After participating in an unsuccessful 1959 assassination attempt on then [[Prime Minister of Iraq]] [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]], Saddam became a fugitive, and eventually fled to Syria and then Egypt. Following the Ba'athists overthrow of the prime minister in the [[February 1963 Iraqi coup d'état]], and the counter-coup half a year later, Saddam was jailed in Iraq from 1964 to 1966. The Ba'ath party returned to power after another successful coup in 1968. General [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], a relative of Saddam Hussein, became President, and Saddam became his deputy. In 1979, Saddam Hussein displaced General Bakr, and a little more than a year later, he ordered Iraqi troops to invade Iran, starting the [[Iran–Iraq War]] that would continue until 1988. Iraq's 1990 [[Invasion of Kuwait]] led to the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. In 1998, Saddam halted Iraqi cooperation with the [[United Nations Special Commission]]  weapons inspections imposed on Iraq after the Gulf War, and kept U.N. inspectors out until 2002.&lt;ref name=Files&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/the-saddam-files-his-final-interviews-1732178.html |title=The Saddam Files: His final interviews |first= David | last =Connett |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2009-07-07 | date=2009-07-05|quote=The FBI has just been forced to release records detailing the ex-Iraqi President's interrogations. David Connett sifts them for the key comments.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2003, the United States led an [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]] that quickly toppled the government. Saddam fled the capital of [[Baghdad]] shortly before [[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|it fell in mid April]],&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt; and disappeared; he was finally captured on December 13 of that year by U.S. soldiers. Saddam remained in U.S. military custody throughout his subsequent [[Trial of Saddam Hussein|criminal trial]]. On November 5, 2006, Saddam was found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]], and was turned over to the [[Iraqi Interim Government]] for [[Execution of Saddam Hussein|his execution]] by [[hanging]] just before the end of that year, on the 30th of December.&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;

===Controlling agency===
When Saddam was initially questioned, he gave his [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Military Intelligence Corps]] interrogators only evasive or rhetorical answers.&lt;ref name=TIME&gt;{{cite news

'I have asked (CIA Director) [[George Tenet]] to be responsible for the handling of the interrogation of Saddam Hussein and his people,' Rumsfeld said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While Saddam's official status was initially undetermined pending legal review, the U.S. Defense Department announced that he was classified as a prisoner of war on January 9, 2004.&lt;ref name=Jehl&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/10/world/the-struggle-for-iraq-captive-hussein-given-pow-status-access-sought.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CAPTIVE; Hussein Given P.O.W.

After Saddam was declared a prisoner of war, he had to be repatriated to his home country of Iraq after cessation of hostilities, according to the [[International Red Cross]], who monitors compliance with the [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref name=Jehl/&gt;
The U.S. Government had also announced that it wanted to turn him over to a new Iraqi government for a public trial with international observers.&lt;ref name=Jehl/&gt; The CIA realized early on that covert officers conducting the interrogations could end up being called as witnesses in a future court proceeding, and invited the FBI to take a more active role.&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,107552,00.html |title=Saddam Interrogation Could Become Public |author= |publisher=[[Fox News Channel|FoxNews.com]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2009-07-07 |date=2004-01-06 |quote=CIA interrogators taking on Saddam Hussein must contend with the likelihood that some of their questioning could become public during his eventual trial.

Control of the interrogation was finally transferred to FBI agents, who are trained to interview suspects in preparation for prosecutions.&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jehl/&gt; The combined interrogation team was composed of CIA analysts and FBI agents, [[intelligence analyst]]s, [[language specialist]]s, and a [[Offender profiling|behavioral profiler]].&lt;ref name=FBI/&gt;

===Interrogation methods===
The FBI began documenting sessions they characterized as "formal interviews" beginning on February 7.&lt;ref name=NSA/&gt; There is little public information available on the interrogations prior to this date since the operations were [[Classified information|secret]], but one unnamed U.S. official described the process as "a chess game," because Saddam was facing a possible death sentence, and had little incentive to speak.&lt;ref name=Jehl/&gt; Several experts speaking publicly at the time made similar assessments, and set low expectations for the information that could be obtained from Saddam.&lt;ref name=TIME/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewsHour/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; Although it was speculated that the CIA would employ multiple interrogators using [[good cop/bad cop]] role play,&lt;ref name=NewsHour/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt;
the FBI used a single primary interrogator, SSA George Piro, who built up a rapport with Saddam over time.&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beyond&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/from-beyond-the-grave-saddam-reveals-all-nearly-1732167.html |title=From beyond the grave, Saddam reveals all (nearly) |first= David | last =Connett |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2009-07-07 | date=2009-07-05|quote=The documents suggest that an extraordinary rapport developed over time between Saddam and his interrogator, George L Piro, one of the very few FBI agents who spoke Arabic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piro said that their bond became so strong that he saw Saddam tear up when they said goodbye for the last time.&lt;ref name="isbn0-307-38214-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=60min/&gt;

Piro described how he seated Saddam with "his back against the wall" to reinforce that psychological impression, but denied using any of the [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] approved for use by the CIA, because he said it was against FBI policy,&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt; and would not have worked in this case.&lt;ref name=60min/&gt; In the 2008 ''60 Minutes''  interview, he revealed details of how he took total control over the prisoner's situation to create a dependence that he would use to obtain cooperation.&lt;ref name=60min/&gt; He also listened patiently as his subject gave his recollections and interpretation of historical events, appealing to Saddam's sense of [[Psychological egoism|self-importance]] to obtain information.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Prisoner of war status placed certain constraints on the permissible interrogation techniques; for example, threats of punishment or offers of improved conditions in return for cooperation were prohibited, according to [[Ruth Wedgwood]], an expert on the Geneva Conventions who is a professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name=Jehl/&gt;

==Notable quotations==
Although the FBI reports were generally written in a narrative fashion, they occasionally provided direct quotations attributed to Saddam Hussein, translated from Arabic to English by the FBI. Some of these quotes were highlighted in secondary source accounts of the reports, including these (grouped by subject in rough chronological order):

=== Iran-Iraq War===

* "Khomeini and Iran would have occupied all of the Arab world if it had not been for Iraq,"&lt;ref name=Cockburn&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockburn-a-man-of-brutality-and-arrogance-who-knew-how-to-play-to-american-suspicions-1732179.html |title=A man of brutality and arrogance who knew how to play to American suspicions |first= Patrick | last = Cockburn |authorlink= Patrick Cockburn |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2009-07-07 | date=2009-07-05|quote= The anti-Iranian theme is constant throughout, and no doubt Saddam believed it as well as saying it out of political calculation. Of the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, he says: ‘Khomeini and Iran would have occupied all of the Arab world if it had not been for Iraq.'&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical weapons===
*"If I had the [prohibited] weapons, would I have let United States forces stay in Kuwait without attacking?" referring to the 1991 Gulf War&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;
* "My God, if I had such weapons, I would have used them in the fight against the U.S," referring to the 2003 Iraq War&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=Meek0624/&gt;
* "I will not be cornered or caught on some technicality. It will not do you any good," in refusing to answer questions about use of chemical weapons in Iran and Iraq&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;
*"I am not going to answer that, no matter how you put the question. I will discuss everything unless it hurts my people, my friends and the army."&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;

===Israel / Palestine===
* "We accepted them as guests," referring to representatives of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]] and the [[Abu Nidal]] Organisation who were allowed entry to Iraq on the condition that they refrain from terrorism.&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;
* "A solution that does not convince the majority of Palestinians will not be successful"&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;
* "Every thing that happened to us was because of Israel. Israel pushes US politicians and fills them with hatred," referring to his decision to launch [[Scud]] missiles against Israel during the Gulf War.&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;

===Iraq war rationale===
* "The U.S. used the 9/11 attack as a justification to attack Iraq" and "lost sight of the cause of 9/11"&lt;ref name=Meek0624/&gt;
* "Osama Bin Laden's ideology was no different than the many zealots that came before him"&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jkp180hkTWA5Yz2zINywSGQFJ6cw |title= Saddam stayed in Baghdad until city fell: FBI| first=Jim | last=Mannion | agency=[[Agence France-Presse]]
 |publisher=[[Google News]] |quote=Bin Laden's ideology 'was no different than the many zealots that came before him,' Saddam told Piro, according to the summary, which said the two 'did not have the same vision or philosophy.'&amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"If you asked the American soldier, who came to Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction but none have been found, and who came to remove the leaders of the Saddam dictatorship who are now all in jail, whether he wanted to stay or go, he would say go."&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;

===Fugitive status===
* "This is movie magic, not reality," laughing off his alleged use of look-alike [[body double]]s for his personal security&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo/&gt;
*"We will struggle in secret," were his last words at the final meeting of senior Iraqi leadership, shortly before fleeing Baghdad in April 2003.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;

===The interrogation===
*"Do you think I would tell my enemy if I made a mistake?" referring to the American system of government, not the interviewer&lt;ref name=Files/&gt;
* "Perhaps a conversation between two such educated people will not be useful or successful," showing respect for Piro’s relative intelligence.&lt;ref name=Beyond/&gt;
* "I think the questions should be in the context of a dialogue, not an interrogation," in reference his questioning by Piro&lt;ref name=Meek0626/&gt;

== Disputed press reports ==
A number of press reports describe the Iraqi dictator admitting to a catastrophic miscalculation, having misled the United States into believing Iraq still possessed biological and chemical weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Nasaw, Daniel. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/02/saddam-hussein-fbi-iraq-iran FBI reports describe Saddam Hussein's reasons for refusing UN inspectors] ''The Guardian''. 2 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Associated Press'': "Saddam Hussein told an FBI interviewer before he was hanged that he allowed the world to believe he had weapons of mass destruction because he was worried about appearing weak to Iran".&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

This interpretation has been challenged by journalist Solomon Hughes, writing: "You might remember that we invaded Iraq because Saddam did have WMD, but was pretending he didn't. Now it turns out we invaded Iraq because Saddam did not have WMD, but pretended he did."

&lt;blockquote&gt;How did Saddam let the world believe Iraq had WMD by denying he had WMD? How does this story work? It doesn't, because the [Associated Press] report is false. FBI agent Pinto's actual record of a casual conversation with Saddam reads: "Even though Hussein claimed Iraq did not have WMD, the threat from Iran was a major factor as to why he did not allow the return of the UN inspectors. Hussein stated he was more concerned about Iran discovering Iraq's weaknesses and vulnerabilities than the repercussions of the United States for his refusal to allow UN inspectors back into Iraq." So in 1998 Saddam resisted the UN weapons inspectors because he did not want to look weak in front of Iran, with whom he had fought a vicious eight-year war. This is not the same as pretending to have WMD. Saddam did not want to look like he could be pushed around by the UN lest his neighbours scent weakness, but his government repeatedly—and accurately—denied having WMD.&lt;ref name=solomon&gt;Hughes, Solomon. "Lies, lies and more lies" ''Morning Star''. 09 July, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Itamar Augusto Cautiero Franco''' ({{IPA-pt|itaˈmaɾ ˈfɾɐ̃ku}}; June 28, 1930{{spaced ndash}}July 2, 2011) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of Brazil|33rd]]  [[President of Brazil]] from December 29, 1992 to December 31, 1994.&lt;ref name=galeria&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.planalto.gov.br/acervo/galeria-de-presidentes|title=Galery of presidents|language=portuguese|publisher=Palácio do Planalto|access-date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously he was [[Vice President of Brazil#List of Vice Presidents|Vice President of Brazil]] from 1990 until the resignation of President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]]. During his long political career Franco also served as [[Senate of Brazil|Senator]], Mayor, Ambassador and Governor. At the time of his death he was a Senator from [[Minas Gerais]], having won the seat in the 2010 election.

==Early life and family background==

Franco was born prematurely at sea,&lt;ref name="independent1993"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The Independent | url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/brazils-leader-all-at-sea-as-economy-sinks-itamar-francos-course-is-still-uncertain-writes-phil-davison-in-rio-de-janeiro-1454374.html | title=

His mother's name was "Itália", which means "Italy" in Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;KOIFMAN, Fábio. Presidentes Do Brasil: De Deodoro A Fhc.&lt;/ref&gt; Franco's father died before his birth.

His family was from [[Juiz de Fora]], Minas Gerais, where he grew up and became a civil engineer in 1955, graduating from the [[School of Engineering of Juiz de Fora]].

==Career before Vice Presidency==

[[File:Itamar Franco (17686209642).jpg|thumb|left|Franco in the 1970s]]
Entering politics in the mid-1950s, Franco first served as alderman and deputy mayor of Juiz de Fora, before getting elected as mayor (1967 to 1971 and again from 1973 to 1974). He resigned as mayor in 1974 and ran successfully for the Federal Senate as a representative of Minas Gerais.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/americas/former-president-of-brazil-itamar-franco-dies-at-age-81/2011/07/02/AGdG5AvH_story.html|title=Former Brazilian President Itamar Franco, known for dies of a stroke at age 81|date=July 2, 2011|work=Washington Post|accessdate=July 3, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He soon became a senior figure in the MDB (Movimento Democrático Brasileiro – Brazilian Democratic Movement he was deputy leader twice, in 1976 and 1977), the official opposition to the military regime that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. Re-elected as a senator in 1982, he was defeated in an attempt to be elected governor of Minas Gerais in 1986 as a candidate of the Liberal Party (PL). During his tenure he was one of the key figures of (then failed) initiative to immediate restoration of the direct elections for President. During his Senate term, Franco served as PL leader in that chamber.

As a member of the National Constituent Assembly which began on February 1, 1987, Franco voted for severance of relations between Brazil and countries that develop a policy of [[racial discrimination]] (as was then the case of South Africa), the establishment of the writ of mandamus Collective; 50% more pay for overtime after a forty-hour work-week, the legalization of abortion, the continuous shift of six hours of notice proportional to length of service, the union unity, popular sovereignty, the nationalization of subsoil, the nationalization of the financial system of a limiting the payment of external debt burden and creating a fund to support land reform.

Meanwhile, he voted against propositions to reintroduce the death penalty, confirming the [[presidential system]] and extension of President [[José Sarney]]'s term, whom he opposed and called for removal for an alleged corruption. When Franco became President, Sarney became one of his allies.

==Vice Presidency (1990-1992) ==

[[File:Fernando Collor e Itamar Franco 2.jpg|thumb|left|Franco with President [[Fernando Collor de Mello]]]] 
In 1989, Franco left PL and joined the small PRN (National Reconstruction Party) to be selected the running-mate of the presidential candidate [[Fernando Collor de Mello]]. A main reason behind Franco's selection was that he represented one of the largest states (in contrast to Collor, who was from small state of [[Alagoas]]), and publicity he gained during his call for impeachment against President [[José Sarney]] for alleged corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/brazil/97.htm Brazil – Franco's Presidency]&lt;/ref&gt;

Collor and Franco won a very narrow election against a man who would later become President (2003–2010), [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]].

Once in office, Franco broke with Collor, threatening a resignation several times, as he disagreed with some of the President's policies, especially regarding [[privatization]], voicing his opposition openly.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/brazil/97.htm Brazil – Franco's Presidency, 1992 – 94]&lt;/ref&gt;

On Tuesday, September 29, 1992, Collor was charged with corruption and was [[impeachment|impeached]] by the Congress. Under the Brazilian Constitution, an impeached president's powers are suspended for 180 days. As such, Franco served as acting president from October 2, 1992 until Collor resigned on December 29, at which point he formally took office as president.

When he became acting President, despite having been Vice President for nearly three years, polls showed that the majority of the population did not know who he was.&lt;ref name="independent1993"/&gt;

==Presidency (1992-1995) ==

===Domestic policy and presidential style===
[[File:Itamar Franco.jpg|thumb|left|President Franco in 1993]]
Franco took power as Brazil was in the midst of a severe economic crisis, with inflation reaching 1,110% in 1992 and rocketing to almost 2,400% in 1993. Franco developed a reputation as a mercurial leader, but he selected as his Finance Minister [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], who launched the "[[Plano Real]]" that stabilized the economy and ended inflation.

In an unusual gesture,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} moments before taking office, Franco handed senators a piece of paper on which he had listed his personal net worth and properties. Initially, his approval rating reached 60 percent.&lt;ref name="nytimes1992" /&gt;

After the troubled Collor Presidency, Franco quickly installed a politically-balanced cabinet and sought broad support in Congress.&lt;ref name="countrystudies.us"/&gt;

During his Presidency, in April 1993, Brazil held a long-announced [[Brazilian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum to determine the political system]] (remaining a Republic or restoration of the [[Brazilian Imperial Family|Monarchy]]) and the form of government (presidential or parliamentary system).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa4000/is_200110/ai_n8962604/pg_8 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Republican and presidential system prevailed by large majorities respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/22/world/brazilians-vote-down-kings-and-keep-presidents.html Brazilians Vote Down Kings and Keep Presidents, James Brooke, April 22, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; Franco always preferred the parliamentary government.

In 1993, Franco resisted calls from various military and civilian offices to shut down the Congress (described by some sources as a "coup attempt").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/world/brazilian-official-tells-of-93-plot.html Brazilian Official Tells of '93 Plot, January 7, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt;

His administration is credited for restoring integrity and stability in government, particularly after the troubled Collor presidency. The President himself kept his reputation of honesty, and his personal style was viewed as very different from Collor's, who practiced "an imperial and ceremonious presidential role". On the other hand, Franco's own personal behavior was sometimes described as temperamental and eccentric.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/brazil/97.htm Franco's Presidency, 1992 – 94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Ladle, Huw Hennessy, Brian Bell, ''Brazil'', Langenscheidt Publishing Group, 1998, {{ISBN|0-88729-130-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88729-130-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-876463.html Brazilian's Reputation Seen Reaching Bottom; President Again Fails to Skirt Controversy, The Washington Post, February 17, 1994, Jeb Blount]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1993, Franco offered a resignation in order to call an earlier election, but Congress turned it down.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/21/world/brazil-leader-s-offer-to-quit-is-turned-down-by-congress.html Brazil Leader's Offer to Quit Is Turned Down by Congress, Thursday, October 21, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of term, Franco's job approval rating soared to nearly 80–90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/brazil/97.htm Brazil – Franco's Presidency, 1992–94]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/31/opinion/l-brazil-s-ex-president-accomplished-much-871595.html Brazil's Ex-President Accomplished Much, Wednesday, May 31, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;
Until May 2016, Franco remained the last President of Brazil not to have been elected as such.

===Foreign policy===

[[File:ItamarFranco.jpg|thumb|120px|Itamar Franco in 2004]]

Despite being sometimes described as a "man with limited diplomatic skills", Franco is credited with launching of idea of a free trade zone covering the whole of South America, which was praised by such leaders as U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Also during his Government, Brazil ratified important pacts (for example the [[Tlatelolco Treaty]] and a quadripartite agreement also involving [[Argentina]] and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] on full-scope safeguards), which set Brazil on the nonproliferation path.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

==After the Presidency==
[[File:Presidentes do Brasil 2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Presidents Itamar Franco, [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] and [[José Sarney]], at the funeral of [[Pope John Paul II]] in 2005.]]
Franco was barred from running for a full term in 1994. Whenever a Brazilian vice president serves part of a president's term, it counts as a full term, and at the time Brazilian presidents were barred from immediate reelection.  Fernando Henrique Cardoso became the official (sometimes described as Franco's hand-picked) candidate to succeed Franco and was elected President in late 1994. Franco, however, soon became a severe critic of Cardoso's government and disagreed with the privatization program. Thereafter, he served as the Ambassador to Portugal in Lisbon and then as Ambassador to the [[Organization of American States]] in Washington, DC, until 1998.

[[File:Itamar Franco 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Senator Franco in May 2011.]]
Franco considered a presidential run in 1998, but ultimately backed off after constitution changes allowed Cardoso to run again. However, he was elected governor of Minas Gerais in 1998 against the Cardoso-supported incumbent in a landslide, and as soon as he took office, he enacted a moratorium on state debt payments, worsening the national economic crisis. Itamar Franco served in the governor's seat until 2003 (declining to seek reelection and supporting the eventual winning candidate [[Aécio Neves]]) and was then the ambassador to [[Italy]], until leaving the position in 2005. During the 2002 presidential election, Franco endorsed [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], who got elected,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanpost.com/index.php?mod=seccion&amp;secc=1&amp;conn=1123 Candidates brace for runoff in Brazil, LatinAmerican Post]&lt;/ref&gt; even if he, again, declined to run himself.

Having unsuccessfully sought, at age 76, the PMDB presidential nomination in [[Brazilian general election, 2006|2006]], he backed [[Geraldo Alckmin]] against Lula, despite having been considered again, despite his advanced age, as a candidate for [[Brazilian general election, 2010|President in 2010]].

Franco ran instead for to be a [[Senate of Brazil|Senator]] from Minas, and won the race along with Neves.

==Personal life==
Franco was divorced in 1971 and had two daughters.&lt;ref name="nytimes1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/27/style/a-squall-at-carnival.html A Squall At Carnival, JAMES BROOKE, Sunday, February 27, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; Before and during his presidency, he had a reputation as a ladies' man, and his personal life was a subject of huge public interest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/brazils-leader-all-at-sea-as-economy-sinks-itamar-francos-course-is-still-uncertain-writes-phil-davison-in-rio-de-janeiro-1454374.html Brazil's leader all at sea as economy sinks: Itamar Franco's course is still uncertain, writes Phil Davison in Rio de Janeiro, Saturday, April 10, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8618837/Itamar-Franco.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Itamar Franco | date=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He authored some 19 published works, ranging from discussions on nuclear energy to short stories.&lt;ref name="nytimes1992"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=The New York Times | title= Inheritor of Tarnished Presidency: Itamar Augusto Cantiero Franco | last= Nash | first= Nathaniel C. | date = December 30, 1992 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/30/world/man-in-the-news-inheritor-of-tarnished-presidency-itamar-augusto-cantiero-franco.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Having been diagnosed with [[leukemia]], Franco was admitted to the [[Albert Einstein Hospital]], in [[São Paulo]], on May 21, 2011. On June 28, his condition worsened and he developed severe [[pneumonia]], being taken to ICU and placed under [[mechanical ventilation]]. He died in the morning of Saturday, July 2, 2011, after suffering a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/04/world/americas/04franco.html?ref=deathsobituaries|title=Itamar Franco, Former President of Brazil, Dies at 81|author=[[Associated Press]]|date=July 3, 2011|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oglobo.globo.com.com"&gt;[http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/mat/2011/06/29/morre-senador-ex-presidente-itamar-franco-aos-81-anos-924793359.asp Morre o senador e ex-presidente Itamar Franco aos 81 anos, Saturday, July 2, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/07/02/brazil.former.president/index.html?eref=edition_americas Former Brazilian president dies, Saturday, July 2, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Seven days of mourning were declared by President [[Dilma Rousseff]].

A [[child prodigy]], Joey Alexander taught himself to play jazz at age six, by listening to his father's classic jazz albums.&lt;ref name="CBS0507" /&gt; He won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Master-Jam Fest when he was nine.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512"/&gt;

In 2014, [[Wynton Marsalis]] invited him to play at [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]], which, according to ''[[The New York Times]]'', made him an "overnight sensation".&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt; He released his first album, ''[[My Favorite Things (Joey Alexander album)|My Favorite Things]]'', in 2015 at age 11.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt; Joey Alexander played at the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival|Montreal]] and [[Newport Jazz Festival]]s in 2015, and has performed for [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Bill Clinton]], Wendy Kiess, and [[Barack Obama]].

==Early life==
Josiah Alexander Sila was born in [[Denpasar]], [[Bali]], Indonesia, to parents Denny Sila and Farah Leonora Urbach, who ran an adventure tourism business.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512"/&gt; His father was an amateur musician,&lt;ref name="Newport"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joey Alexander |publisher=[[Newport Jazz Festival]] |year=2015 |url=http://www.newportjazzfest.org/index.php?pID=15&amp;MUS=619&amp;GIG=28&amp;ARTIST=Joey%20Alexander |accessdate=24 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZXGYXbkB?url=http://www.newportjazzfest.org/index.php?pID=15 |archivedate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and both parents were fans of jazz, particularly [[Louis Armstrong]]. He is the nephew of the [[rock music|rock]] singer [[Nafa Urbach]],&lt;ref name="Chilton0513"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chilton |first=Martin |title=The 11-year-old taking jazz world by storm |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=13 May 2015 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/11601509/The-11-year-old-taking-jazz-world-by-storm.html |accessdate=24 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZXGdllGd?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/11601509/The-11-year-old-taking-jazz-world-by-storm.html |archivedate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Indonesian musician and songwriter [[Alam Urbach]]. He learned about jazz by listening to classic albums his father gave him.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt; By age six, he had taught himself to play piano using a miniature, electric keyboard his father brought home for him,&lt;ref name="CBS0507"&gt;{{cite news|title=10-Year-Old Piano Prodigy From Indonesia Takes New York By Storm |publisher=[[WCBS-TV]] |date=7 May 2014 |url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/07/10-year-old-piano-prodigy-from-indonesia-takes-new-york-by-storm/ |accessdate=24 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZXGiuaIY?url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/05/07/10-year-old-piano-prodigy-from-indonesia-takes-new-york-by-storm/ |archivedate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512"&gt;{{cite news|title=11-Year-Old Indonesian Jazz Piano Prodigy Releases Debut CD |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |date=12 May 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/12/arts/ap-us-music-joey-alexander.html |accessdate=24 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZXGogaVF?url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/05/12/arts/ap-us-music-joey-alexander.html?_r=0 |archivedate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; learning by ear compositions such as [[Thelonious Monk]]'s "[[Well, You Needn't]]" and other songs from his father's jazz collection.&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; He later said learning the instrument came naturally to him,&lt;ref name="CBS0507" /&gt; and considers his ability "a gift from God".&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; He cites as influences [[John Coltrane]], [[Harry Connick Jr.]], [[Bill Evans]], and [[Herbie Hancock]], and he particularly admires [[Clifford Brown]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[Brad Mehldau]], [[Lee Morgan]], [[Horace Silver]], and [[McCoy Tyner]].&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chilton0513" /&gt;

Due to the unavailability of jazz education in his home town,&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt; he participated in jam sessions in Bali and [[Jakarta]],&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt; where his family moved after disbanding their tourism business so he could live near Indonesia's top jazz musicians.&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; When he was eight, he played for Herbie Hancock when Hancock was visiting Jakarta as a [[UNESCO]] goodwill ambassador. Hancock told Joey Alexander that he believed in him, and Joey Alexander later called that time "the day I decided to dedicate my childhood to jazz".&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; At age 9, he won the Grand Prix at the 2013 Master-Jam Fest, an all-ages jazz competition in [[Odessa]], Ukraine, which included 43 musicians from 17 nations.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt; In 2014, he and his family moved to New York City to pursue a career in music.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;

==Career==
Jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, artistic director of [[Jazz at Lincoln Center]], learned about Joey Alexander after a friend suggested he watch a [[YouTube]] video clip of him playing compositions by Coltrane, Monk and [[Chick Corea]].&lt;ref name="Chilton0513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; Marsalis praised Joey Alexander as "my hero" on his [[Facebook]] page,&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt; and invited him to appear at his organization's gala in May 2014, when he was 10.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS0507" /&gt; It marked Joey Alexander's United States debut.&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; He received positive reviews for his performance, particularly for his solo version of the Monk song "[['Round Midnight (song)|'Round Midnight]]".&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' said he became an "overnight sensation" after the performance.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt; Allen Morrison of ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine said of the performance: "If the word 'genius' still means anything, it applies to this prodigy. He played his own solo variations on 'Round Midnight' with a breathtaking precocity and mastery of several decades of piano style."&lt;ref name="Downbeat0505"&gt;{{cite news|title=Jazz at Lincoln Center's Annual Gala Charms With an Evening of Inspired Riffs |work=[[Down Beat]] |date=5 May 2015 |url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=news&amp;subsect=news_detail&amp;nid=2374 |accessdate=24 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZXGvIskJ?url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=news |archivedate=24 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marsalis said of him: "There has never been anyone that you can think of who could play like that at his age. I loved everything about his playing – his rhythm, his confidence, his understanding of the music."&lt;ref name="Chilton0513" /&gt; Jeanne Moutoussamy-Ashe, widow of tennis player [[Arthur Ashe]], invited Joey Alexander to perform at the Arthur Ashe Learning Center gala, where he played for a crowd that included former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]]. Moutoussamy-Ashe introduced him to Gordon Uehling III, founder of the CourtSense Tennis Training Center, who has allowed Joey Alexander and his family to stay at his estate in [[Alpine, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;

Joey Alexander played at A Great Night in Harlem at the [[Apollo Theater]], a performance honoring Herbie Hancock. His performance at the [[University of the District of Columbia]] garnered [[Viral video|viral attention]] on the internet, drawing more than 500,000 views on Facebook.&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt; He also played in a concert with students of the [[Juilliard School]], the proceeds of which funded his continuing stay in New York City. The concert, which received national media attention on [[NBC News]], was successful enough for him to obtain an [[O visa|O-1B visa]], which is granted to "individuals with extraordinary ability".&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; He also gave concert performances in 2014 at the [[Copenhagen Jazz Festival]] and the International [[Java Jazz Festival]] in Jakarta.&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt;

Joey Alexander's debut album, ''[[My Favorite Things (Joey Alexander album)|My Favorite Things]]'', was released on 12 May 2015, on the Harlem-based label [[Motéma Music]] and produced by Jason Olaine.

It also includes an original composition called "Ma Blues", which was inspired by [[Bobby Timmons]]' "[[Moanin' (song)|Moanin']]".&lt;ref name="Chilton0513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; ''My Favorite Things'' featured Alexander alongside Russell Hall, Alphonso Horne and Sammy Miller, as well as guest performers [[Larry Grenadier]] and [[Ulysses Owens]].&lt;ref name="Newport" /&gt; He had several performances in 2015, including one at the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]],&lt;ref name="Chilton0513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; and another at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]] in August.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt; Newport producer George Wein is reluctant to sign alleged child prodigies, but made an exception after Moutoussamy-Ashe took Joey Alexander to Wein's [[Manhattan]] apartment to play for him. Wein said he distinguished himself with "the maturity of his harmonic approach".&lt;ref name="Chilton0513" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP0512" /&gt; The Jazz at Lincoln Center has expressed interest in incorporating Joey Alexander into its educational outreach efforts, hoping to encourage young people to listen to jazz music.&lt;ref name="Chinen0512" /&gt;

'''Jorge Alberto Bolaños Suarez''' (born  7 November 1936 in  [[Las Tunas (city)|Las Tunas]], [[Cuba]]) is a [[Cuba]]n [[politician]] and [[diplomat]].

Bolanos graduated in Political Sciences and International Law from the [[University of Havana]] and did postgraduate courses in Foreign Relations from the [[University of London]].

Ambassador Bolanos has been a member of the Cuban Foreign Ministry since 1963. He has served as ambassador to [[Poland]] (1971–1974), [[Czechoslovakia]] (1974–1977), [[United Kingdom]] (1977–1981), [[Brazil]] (1986–1995) and [[Mexico]] (2001–2007).  From 2007-2012, he served as head of the [[Cuban Interests Section]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and since 1981 he has served as First Vice Minister of the Cuban Foreign Ministry.

During his stay in Mexico, he is known to have had close links with Venezuelan Diplomat Livia Antonieta Acosta-Noguera; a lady who was later transferred to Peru and afterwards to Miami, to serve as Consul, and in December 2011 she appeared conspiring against the U.S. in a documentary made by the Spanish language TV Network UNIVISION called "The Iranian Threat". In January 29, 2012, one of the students from the University of Mexico UNAM publicly stated that Ambassador Bolanos was conspiring with Livia Acosta against the U.S., and Ambassador Bolanos continues to enjoy diplomatic immunity in the U.S.

He is married to Graciela Maria Queral-Queral.

PW1 Temenggong Datuk '''Kanang anak Langkau''', SP, PGB, PGBK, PBS (Rt) (2 March 1945&amp;nbsp;– 3 January 2013) was a [[Malaysia]]n hero and soldier from the [[Iban people|Iban]] [[Dayak people|Dayak]] community in [[Sarawak]]. He was in the [[Royal Ranger Regiment]] and [[Regimental Sergeant Major]] of '''8 Renjer''' (8th Rangers) of the [[Malaysian Army]] with his tag number of 901378. He was awarded the [[Panglima Gagah Berani]] and [[Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa]] medals from the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], [[Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad Shah]] on 3 June 1981. He is the sole recipient of both the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa and Pingat Gagah Berani, and was the last living recipient of the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa.&lt;ref name=klpost/&gt; In the annals of the Malaysian Military History, no one person was more decorated than Kanang anak Langkau of the Ranger Corps. He is one of the very few survivors ever conferred the "Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa" (Valour Award) whilst still alive and a "Pingat Gagah Berani" (the Bravery Medal). No other person has ever received two gallantry awards in the history of the Malaysian Armed Forces. No other Corps can boast of a warrior of his stature but the Ranger Corps.

==Early life and military service==
Kanang anak Langkau was born on 2 March 1945 in [[Julau]], [[Kingdom of Sarawak|Sarawak]]. He entered military service with the [[British Army]], as an Iban Tracker, attending Jungle Warfare School in Ulu Tiram in early 1962. Kanang was attached to the [[42 Commando]] serving during the [[Brunei Revolt]] and during the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]]. He later served with the [[Royal New Zealand Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Abdullah|first=Firdaus|title=Kanang, many times a hero|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-112597322.html|accessdate=10 January 2013|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=28 August 2005}} (Subscription Required)&lt;/ref&gt; He was absorbed into the [[Sarawak Rangers]] which eventually became part of the [[Royal Ranger Regiment|Malaysian Rangers]] when Malaysia was proclaimed on 16 September 1963.&lt;ref name=klpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=borneopost1-3&gt;{{cite news|title=Farewell soldier, "Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban" till the end|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/01/03/farewell-soldier-agi-idup-agi-ngelaban-till-the-end-new/|accessdate=7 January 2013|newspaper=Borneo Post online|date=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanang joined the Sarawak Rangers as an Iban tracker on 21 April 1962. (He was among those recruited by the late Bennett Jarrow). Sarawak Rangers was then part of the British Army and later absorbed into the Malaysian Army’s Royal Ranger Regiment upon the formation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 between the then Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah (then North Borneo) and Sarawak with Singapore ceded later and Brunei opted not to join.

In an operation in the Korbu Forest Reserve at Fort Legap on 1 June 1979 whilst on a mission tracking the enemy, Sergeant Kanang's group came across a temporary enemy resting camp. Sergeant Kanang ak Langkau from the 8th Battalion Royal Rangers immediately launched an attack on that enemy camp, an enemy that far outnumbered the Kanang's group. In this fierce contact with the enemy, two of the Rangers went down, mortally wounded. Five of the enemy were killed, enemy equipment too were captured. He was conferred the highest gallantry award, the "Pingat Gagah Berani" by his Majesty the King.

In an incident in Tanah Hitam, Perak on 8 February 1980 a soldier was killed. Kanang leading a platoon was sent to track the enemy down and destroy them. For eleven days they tracked the enemy until they stumbled upon a much larger enemy force at Ladang Kinding, Sungei Siput, Perak.

The tracking skills of Kanang and his courage led him successfully to follow up on the enemy. The enemy was cunning and skillful in the use of the ground to their advantage. The lay of the land at that time was an obstacle as they were in very difficult terrain. The enemy was very adept at concealment, with the years piled on fighting the British and the Malayans before that. The tactics used by the enemy to throw off Kanang and his group off their trail was never ending. Due to the courage of Kanang and his tracking skills, the Rangers managed to keep up with the enemy. Even as some of his men were disheartened, he kept their morale up by encouraging them.

Since the death of the soldier 11 days he managed to doggedly track and identify the enemy's exact route of escape. On the evening of 19 February 1980 at around 1500, after conducting a reconnaissance with great caution and care, his platoon managed to estimate the location of the enemy, which was located not very far from their location.

Actually they were inside the location of the enemy, as they were at the foot of the hill. They only realized that they were inside the enemy's location when they found a communication cord from the enemy sentry's location. This cord was running from the sentry's location to the enemy's main force. This cord is normally attached to a small bush or empty cans which make noise when pulled. This way the main force can be alerted by the sentry when an enemy approaches.

At that moment, Sergeant Kanang was approximately 8 meters from the enemy sentry's location. Realizing that, he launched the assault towards the right by firing towards the right of the enemy along with his platoon. After launching the attack to the right, it suddenly struck everyone that the enemy's main force was on the left, below the slope of the hill. Without losing his senses, he switched the direction of fire to the left, at the same time changing the direction of the assault to the left.

They ploughed into the enemy but a large force of the enemy managed to escape. The platoon and Kanang managed to bag five Communist Terrorists on that day. Even with that success, they were saddened by the loss of one of their group who was killed and one more seriously wounded. Whilst trying to rescue his wounded friends, Sergeant Kanang himself was repeatedly shot, he took three rounds from the enemy into his body. The will to live and fight another day was strong, he was in comma for two months in hospital but recuperated and was back on active duty. His fellow Ibans say Kanang died but came alive again!

==The legendary battle cry ==

Kanang’s battle cry ‘Agi Idup Agi Ngelaban’ (Still Alive, Still Fighting) inspired his men and other soldiers to fight to death in the defence of the nation. It is believed among the Ibans that this battle cry originated from the famous Iban warrior by the name of Libau "[[Rentap]]" who fought the Rajah of Sarawak, [[James Brooke]] at Skrang and Sadok Hill.

The son-in-law Of Libau "Rentap" named Layang was known to be the first Iban to kill (bedengah in Iban) a British officer in Sarawak by the name of Alan Lee at the battle of Lintang Batang at the newly built Skrang fort. It was this incident that caused the Brooke to refuse pardon or accept Rentap's surrender like the other Iban chiefs during that time, notably the sons of Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang" by the name of Nanang and his second brother Luyoh who turned rebels against the Brooke government for killing their third brother Ajie at the battle of Sungai Langit in Padeh. Nanang was later appointed Orang Kaya Pemancha to replace his father, for his surrender and his assistance to defeat his fellow Iban chief Libau "Rentap" at Sadok Hill who he followed just before that surrender. The cannon named "Bujang Timpang Berang" (One Shoulder Guy) marked with the year 1515 was actually obtained by Orang Kaya Pemancha Dana "Bayang" in a ngayau expedition to Sambas, Kalimantan and inherited by his sons.

Libau "Rentap" was only defeated after three repeated punitive expeditions by the Brooke force at Sadok Hill but he never surrendered to the White Man like his fellow countrymen did at that material time. He died as a hero and was accorded a warrior or chieftain cremation on a platform above the ground (called "dilumbong" in Iban) at the Sibau Hill in Pakan Sarawak and his bones were installed inside a jar in a traditional Iban ceremony called "ngerapoh" for safe keeping by his family vis-a-vis a normal burial under the ground for ordinary persons. In recent time, his bones were put inside a proper coffin and a sungkup hut built at the same Sibau Hill which can be visited by tourists.

Indeed, the ngayau or headhunting spirit of the Ibans for which they were legendary before the practice ceased, is still very much in the blood and body of Kanang and other heroes from Sarawak.

==Honors==

For his bravery, Kanang was awarded the nation’s two highest awards Sri Pahlawan Perkasa (SP) and the Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) by His Majesty the King Yang Di-Pertuan Agong Sultan Ahmad Shah in June 1981.

He retired as Warrant Officer One (WOI) after serving the army for more than 21 years.

A book entitled Kanang, The Story of a Hero was written about his military service and used as a literature text book in the Malaysian national secondary school.

Prior to Kanang, Awang anak Raweng who was an Iban Scout from Sarawak in Borneo, won the George Cross for gallantry as recorded in the London Gazette on 20 November 1951.[1] The only Sarawakian who was bestowed with the highest British gallantry award. King George bestowed the 83-year-old veteran from Nanga Skrang, Sri Aman with the George Cross on 20 November 1951 in recognition of his bravery in fighting the communists all by himself after he and four other British army personnel were ambushed in Kluang, Johor on 27 May 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibancustoms.wordpress.com/iban-heroes-part-2|title=IBAN HEROES PART 2|date=21 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Please note Nanga Skrang is the original place of the famous Iban warrior Libau "Rentap" during the James Brooke era.

==Retirement and recognition==
Kanang retired after 21 years of service as a [[First Warrant Officer]]. He was the [[Temenggong]] (paramount chief) of the Iban in [[Sri Aman]], his place of residence. He was awarded the [[Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak|Officer of the Most Exalted Order of the Star of Sarawak]] (PBS) ''(Malay: Pegawai Bintang Sarawak)'' in 1987.&lt;ref name=klpost/&gt;

Malaysia’s most decorated war hero Kanang Anak Langkau could have died as a pauper as his military services – helping to liberate Malaya (and later Malaysia) from the communists were not respected as a hero should be until he and few other war heroes made noise complaining that they had been treated shabbily both by the Federal Government and Sarawak State Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebrokenshield.blogspot.com/2013/01/kanang-ak-langkau-was-initially.html|title=The Broken Shield: Kanang Ak Langkau was initially shabbily treated|first=|last=Jetty|date=9 January 2018|publisher=|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their contributions were not financially recognized – not even a sen and their welfare were not taken care of, as compared to financial rewards and other perks given to communist terrorists who surrendered.

There were six holders of Sri Pahlawan (SP) Gagah Perkasa (the Gallantry Award) from Sarawak, and with the death of Kanang Anak Langkau, there is one SP holder in the person of Sgt. Ngalinuh (an Orang Ulu).

The heroes were 21 holders of Panglima Gagah Berani (PGB) with 16 survivors. Of the total, there are fourteen (14) Ibans, one Bidayuh, one Kayan, one Malay and two Chinese army officers. But the majorities in the Armed Forces are Malays, according to a book – Crimson Tide over Borneo. The youngest of the PGB holder is ASP Wilfred Gomez of the Police Force.

Kanang Anak Langkau was the holder of both the SP and PGB. Their contributions were initially not rewarded, not even a sen except they received pensions like other retired civil servants.

The heroes were not even invited to attend national day celebrations.

Angered by the ill-treatment, Kanang even refused ‘Datukship’ offered to him saying he was a poor man and could not afford to receive the title of ‘Datukship’.

Their woes got the attention of the Member of Parliament (MP) for Lubok Antu in Sarawak Mr. Jawah Gerang who raised the issue in Parliament some time in the 1980s. Approved by the government, a PGB holder was given a monthly allowance of RM300 and a SP holder RM400.

For PGB holders like Sgt Dajai Angie, their allowances were backdated to 1973. (Dajai was given the bravery medal in 1971).

In 2006, a delegation of the heroes from Sarawak met with the Defence Minister Najib Tun Razak and appealed to increase their monthly allowances by RM700.

Instead of accepting their recommendation, Najib who was also the Deputy Prime Minister decided to more than double the increase of the allowance by RM1,600. The issue was brought to Parliament and approved. Thus, a SP holder receives RM2,000 a month, while a PGB holder receives RM1,900 a month.

Promotionwise, only on 1 November 2010, an Iban Officer by the name of Stephen Mundaw was promoted to a Brigadier-General. He was the first Iban to become a General in the Malaysian Army since Sarawak became independent on 22 July 1963 from the British and forming The Federation of Malaysia on 16 September 1963 along with North Borneo (Sabah now) and Singapore which was ceded later. If you want to look further; he was the first Iban General in the long history of the Malaysian Rangers when its predecessor the Sarawak Rangers was formed by Rajah Charles Brooke in 1862. With this promotion, inadvertently, "an Iban allocation" might have been created in the Malaysian Army.

For his knowledge in Iban traditions and customs, Kanang was later made a Temenggong for the Iban community of Sri Aman division and last year he was conferred a Datukship by the state government.

On 15 April 2009, he made headlines after rescuing a baby orangutan from captivity with his friend, Tay Choon Yong. The baby orangutan was being handed to Semenggoh Wildlife Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/4/15/nation/20090415175444&amp;sec=nation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418154220/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/4/15/nation/20090415175444&amp;sec=nation |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 April 2009 |title=Rescued baby orangutan finds a new home - Nation &amp;#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2011, he was conferred the [[Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak|Commander of the Order of the Star of Hornbill Sarawak]] (PGBK) ''(Panglima Gemilang Bintang Kenyalang''), with the title of [[Datuk]] by the [[Abang Muhammad Salahuddin]], the [[List of Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Sarawak|Head of State's]] 90th Birthday.&lt;ref name=borneopost1-3/&gt;

In 2011, Kanang supervised Operation Mai Pulai.  This operation involved the locating and exhumation of the remains of 21 Iban Trackers and Sarawak Rangers who were killed during the Second Malayan Emergency. Their remains were exhumed from multiple location on the [[Malay Peninsula]] and returned to Sarawak where they were ceremonially reburied in July 2011.&lt;ref name=klpost/&gt;

==Death and Funeral==
On 3 January 2013, he collapsed while watching television at home in Sungai Apong, Sri Aman after complaining of chest pains. Immediately rushed to the Sarawak General Hospital, he was pronounced dead at the age of 67.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/217942 |title=Pahlawan Kanang Anak Langkau meninggal dunia |publisher=Malaysiakini |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nst.com.my/life-times/sunday-life-times/national-hero-datuk-kanang-anak-langkau-dies-1.195409 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130221021919/http://www.nst.com.my/life-times/sunday-life-times/national-hero-datuk-kanang-anak-langkau-dies-1.195409 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 February 2013 |title=National hero Datuk Kanang anak Langkau dies - Sunday Life &amp; Times - New Straits Times |publisher=Nst.com.my |date=3 January 2013 |accessdate=7 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried on 6 January with full military honours at the Heroes’ Grave at Jalan Budaya, Kuching.

Meanwhile, messages of condolences and sympathy have been received by the family of the late Kanang from government leaders including from the Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak and Sarawak Chief Minister Abdul Taib Mahmud.

According to the [[Ministry of Defence (Malaysia)#List of Ministers of Defence|Minister of Defence]], [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi|Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], he will be given a national burial. His coffin, draped in the [[Jalur Gemilang]] and the colours of the Malaysian Armed Forces, was first brought to the 1st Infantry Division base located at Bukavu Camp in Penrissen for the family members and friends to perform prayers and miring ceremony (offering ceremony), before being brought to [[Kuching Civic Centre]] for the public to pay their last respects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/01/05/kanangs-heroic-acts-to-be-immortalised/ |title=‘Kanang’s heroic acts to be immortalised’ – BorneoPost Online &amp;#124; Borneo , Malaysia, Sarawak Daily News &amp;#124; Largest English Daily In Borneo |publisher=Theborneopost.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried at the [[Kuching Heroes Cemetery|Heroes' Grave]] in Jalan Taman Budaya, after the funeral prayers at St.Thomas Cathedral in [[Kuching]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2013/01/07/farewell-to-a-true-soldier/ |title=Farewell to a true soldier *more photos updated – BorneoPost Online &amp;#124; Borneo , Malaysia, Sarawak Daily News &amp;#124; Largest English Daily In Borneo |publisher=Theborneopost.com |date= |accessdate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Ibans, Kanang/s acts in the military service is regarded as "raja berani tau serang" which is commensurate with the highest widower fee for Great War Leader. Otherwise, his temenggong chieftain title entitled him for the fifth widower fee.

==Names and epithets==

[[File:Krishna kills Shishupala.jpg|thumb|250px|Krishna slays Shishupala]]

{{Main article|List of titles and names of Krishna}}

The name "Krishna" originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''{{IAST|Kṛṣṇa}}'', which is primarily an adjective meaning "black", "dark", or "dark blue".&lt;ref name="dictionaries"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The waning moon is called Krishna [[Paksha]], relating to the adjective meaning "darkening".&lt;ref name="dictionaries"/&gt; The name is also interpreted sometimes as "all-attractive".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a name of [[Vishnu]], Krishna is listed as the 57th name in the ''[[Vishnu Sahasranama]]''. Based on his name, Krishna is often depicted in [[murti|idols]] as black- or blue-skinned. Krishna is also known by various [[List of titles and names of Krishna|other names, epithets, and titles]] that reflect his many associations and attributes. Among the most common names are ''Mohan'' "enchanter"; ''[[Govinda]]'' "chief herdsman",&lt;ref&gt;Monier Monier Williams, [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0300/mw__0399.html Go-vinda], Sanskrit English Dictionary and Ettymology, Oxford University Press, p. 336, 3rd column&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Gopala Krishna|Gopala]]'' "Protector of the 'Go'", which means "Soul" or "the cows".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilt"&gt;{{cite book|author = Hiltebeitel, Alf|title = Rethinking the Mahābhārata: a reader's guide to the education of the dharma king|publisher = University of Chicago Press|location = Chicago|year = 2001|pages = 251–53, 256, 259|isbn = 0-226-34054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some names for Krishna hold regional importance; ''[[Jagannatha]]'', found in [[Jagannatha Puri|Puri]] Hindu temple, is a popular incarnation in [[Odisha]] state and nearby regions of [[eastern India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = B.

==Iconography==
[[File:Krishna with flute.jpg|thumb|left|Krishna with cows, herdsmen, and [[Gopi]]s]]
Krishna is represented in the [[Indian tradition|Indian traditions]] in many ways, but with some common features. His iconography typically depicts him with black, dark, or blue skin, like [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T. Richard Blurton|title=Hindu Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJ-lzU_nj_MC&amp;pg=PA134 |year=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-39189-5|pages=133–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ancient and medieval reliefs and stone-based arts depict him in the natural color of the material out of which he is formed, both in India and in [[southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Guy, John|title=Lost Kingdoms: Hindu-Buddhist Sculpture of Early Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vO_-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA222|date=7 April 2014|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|isbn=978-1-58839-524-5|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[a] {{cite journal | last=Cooler | first=Richard M. | title=Sculpture, Kingship, and the Triad of Phnom Da | journal=Artibus Asiae | publisher=JSTOR | volume=40 | issue=1 | year=1978 | page=29 | doi=10.2307/3249812 | jstor=3249812}};&lt;br /&gt;[b] Bertrand Porte (2006), "La statue de Kṛṣṇa Govardhana du Phnom Da du Musée National de Phnom Penh." UDAYA, Journal of Khmer Studies, Volume 7, pages 199-205&lt;/ref&gt; In some texts, his skin is poetically described as the color of [[Jambul]] (''[[Jamun]]'', a purple-colored fruit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vishvanatha|first1=Cakravarti Thakura|title=Sarartha-darsini|date=2011|publisher=Sri Vaikunta Enterprises|isbn=978-81-89564-13-1|pages=790|edition=[[Bhanu Swami]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna is often depicted wearing a peacock-feather [[wreath]] or crown, and playing the [[bansuri]] (Indian flute).&lt;ref name="Grolier"&gt;{{cite book|author =|title = The Encyclopedia Americana|publisher = Grolier|location = [s.l.]|year = 1988|page = 589|isbn = 0-7172-0119-8|oclc =|doi =|accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Encyclopædia Britannica |author = Benton, William|authorlink= |year= 1974|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|isbn=9780852292907|page= 885|url= https://books.google.com/?id=G8YqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Krsna+blue+skin+deity&amp;dq=Krsna+blue+skin+deity}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in front of the other in the ''[[Tribhanga]]'' posture. He is sometimes accompanied by [[cow]]s or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman ''Govinda''. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the [[gopi]]s (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Harle, J.

In other icons, he is a part of battlefield scenes of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''. He is shown as a charioteer, notably when he is addressing the Pandava prince [[Arjuna]] character, symbolically reflecting the events that led to the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''{{snd}}a scripture of Hinduism. In these popular depictions, Krishna appears in the front as the charioteer, either as a counsel listening to Arjuna, or as the driver of the chariot while Arjuna aims his arrows in the [[Kurukshetra war|battlefield of Kurukshetra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ariel Glucklich|title=The Strides of Vishnu: Hindu Culture in Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KtLScrjrWiAC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971825-2|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=T.

[[File:Baby thief Krishna (bazaar art, c.1950's).jpg|thumb|left|Krishna is celebrated in the Vaishnava tradition in various stages of his life, such as ''Maakhan chor'' (butter thief).&lt;ref name=hawley3&gt;{{cite book|author=John Stratton Hawley|title=Krishna, The Butter Thief|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncb_AwAAQBAJ |year=2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5540-7|pages=3–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The earliest text containing detailed descriptions of Krishna as a personality is the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which depicts Krishna as an incarnation of Vishnu.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-357806/Mahabharata|title= Britannica: Mahabharata|accessdate=2008-10-13 |work = encyclopedia|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online |year= 2008|author = Wendy Doniger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krishna is central to many of the main stories of the epic. The eighteen chapters of the sixth book (''Bhishma Parva'') of the epic that constitute the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' contain the advice of Krishna to [[Arjuna]] on the battlefield. The ''[[Harivamsa]]'', a later appendix to the ''Mahabharata'' contains a detailed version of Krishna's childhood and youth.&lt;ref&gt;Maurice Winternitz (1981), History of Indian Literature, Vol. 1, Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-0836408010}}, pages 426–431&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'', estimated to have been composed sometime between the 8th and 6th{{nbsp}}centuries{{nbsp}}BCE, has been another source of speculation regarding Krishna in ancient India. The verse (III.xvii.6) mentions Krishna in "''Krishnaya Devakiputraya''" (Sanskrit: कृष्णाय देवकीपुत्राय) as a student of the sage ''Ghora'' of the ''Angirasa'' family. This phrase, which means "To Krishna the son of [[Devaki]]", has been mentioned by scholars such as [[Max Müller]]&lt;ref name=maxmuller316&gt;Max Müller, [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/48/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad 3.16–3.17], The Upanishads, Part{{nbsp}}I, Oxford University Press, pages 50–53 with footnotes&lt;/ref&gt; as a potential source of fables and Vedic lore about Krishna in the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and other ancient literature{{snd}} only potential, because this verse could have been interpolated into the text,&lt;ref name=maxmuller316/&gt; or the Krishna Devakiputra, could be different from the deity Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Bryant and Maria Ekstrand (2004), The Hare Krishna Movement, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231122566}}, pages 33–34 with note 3&lt;/ref&gt; These doubts are supported by the fact that the much later age ''Sandilya Bhakti Sutras'', a treatise on Krishna,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/ShandilyaBhaktiSutra/shandilya_bhakti_sutras#page/n0/mode/2up Sandilya Bhakti Sutra] SS Rishi (Translator), Sree Gaudia Math (Madras)&lt;/ref&gt; cites later age compilations such as the ''[[Narayana Upanishad]]'' but never cites this verse of the Chandogya Upanishad. Other scholars disagree that the Krishna mentioned along with Devika in the ancient Upanishad is unrelated to the later Hindu god of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' fame. For example, Archer states that the coincidence of the two names appearing together in the same Upanishad verse cannot be dismissed easily.&lt;ref&gt;WG Archer (2004), ''The Loves of Krishna in Indian Painting and Poetry'', Dover, {{ISBN|978-0486433714}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yāska]]'s ''[[Nirukta]]'', an etymological dictionary published around the 6th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BCE, contains a reference to the Shyamantaka jewel in the possession of [[Akrura]], a motif from the well-known Puranic story about Krishna.&lt;ref name = bryant4&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shatapatha Brahmana]] and ''Aitareya-Aranyaka'' associate Krishna with his Vrishni origins.&lt;ref&gt;Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya ''Krishna-cult in Indian Art''. 1996 M.

In ''Ashṭādhyāyī'', authored by the ancient grammarian [[Pāṇini]] (probably belonged to the 5th or 6th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BCE), ''Vāsudeva'', son of Vasudeva, and ''Arjuna'', as recipients of worship, are referred to together in the same ''[[sutra]]''.&lt;ref name="kurukshetra.nic.in"&gt;[http://kurukshetra.nic.in/museum-website/archeologicaltreasure.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217161420/http://kurukshetra.nic.in/museum-website/archeologicaltreasure.html|date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pâṇ.

[[Megasthenes]], a [[Greek ethnographer]] and an ambassador of [[Seleucus I]] to the court of [[Chandragupta Maurya]] towards the end of 4th{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BCE, made reference to [[Megasthenes' Herakles|Herakles]] in his famous work [[Indica (Megasthenes)|Indica]]. This text is now lost to history, but was quoted in secondary literature by later Greeks such as [[Arrian]], [[Diodorus]], and [[Strabo]].{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}} According to these texts, Megasthenes mentioned that the Sourasenoi tribe of India, who worshipped Herakles, had two major cities named Methora and Kleisobora, and a navigable river named the Jobares. According to [[Edwin Bryant (author)|Edwin Bryant]], a professor of Indian religions known for his publications on Krishna, "there is little doubt that the Sourasenoi refers to the Shurasenas, a branch of the [[Yadu]] dynasty to which Krishna belonged".{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}} The word Herakles, states Bryant, is likely a Greek phonetic equivalent of Hari-Krishna, as is Methora of Mathura, Kleisobora of Krishnapura, and the Jobares of [[Yamuna|Jamuna]]. Later, when [[Alexander the Great]] launched his campaign in the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], his associates recalled that the soldiers of [[King Porus|Porus]] were carrying an image of Herakles.{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=5}}

The Buddhist [[Pali canon]] and the Ghata-Jâtaka (No.{{nbsp}}454) [[polemic]]ally mention the devotees of Vâsudeva and Baladeva. These texts have many peculiarities and may be a garbled and confused version of the Krishna legends.{{sfn|Bryant|2007|pp=5–6}} The texts of [[Jainism]] mention these tales as well, also with many peculiarities and different versions, in their legends about [[Tirthankara]]s. This inclusion of Krishna-related legends in ancient [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and Jaina literature suggests that Krishna theology was existent and important in the religious landscape observed by non-Hindu traditions of [[Ancient india|ancient India]].{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;Hemacandra Abhidhânacintâmani, Ed.

The ancient Sanskrit grammarian [[Patanjali]] in his ''[[Mahabhashya]]'' makes several references to Krishna and his associates found in later Indian texts. In his commentary on Pāṇini's verse 3.1.26, he also uses the word ''Kamsavadha'' or the "killing of Kamsa", an important part of the legends surrounding Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 73|editor=K.S.

===Heliodorus pillar and other inscriptions===
A pillar with a Brahmi script inscription was discovered by colonial era archaeologists in the central Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. Using modern techniques, it has been dated to between 125 and 100{{nbsp}}BCE, and traced to an Indo-Greek who served as an ambassador of the Greek king [[Antialcidas]] to a regional Indian king.&lt;ref name="Bopearachchi"/&gt;&lt;ref name=allchin309/&gt; Named after the Indo-Greek, it is now known as the [[Heliodorus pillar]]. Its inscription is a dedication to "Vasudeva", another name for Krishna in the Indian tradition. Scholars consider the "Vasudeva" to be referring to a deity, because the inscription states that it was constructed by "the ''Bhagavata'' Heliodorus" and that it is a "''Garuda'' pillar" (both are Vishnu-Krishna-related terms). Additionally, the inscription includes a Krishna-related verse from chapter{{nbsp}}11.7 of the ''Mahabharata'' stating that the path to immortality and heaven is to correctly live a life of three virtues: self-[[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]] (''damah''), generosity (''cagah'' or ''tyaga''), and vigilance (''apramadah'').&lt;ref name=allchin309/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Salomon|title=Indian Epigraphy: A Guide to the Study of Inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYrG07qQDxkC|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-535666-3|pages=265–267}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamín Preciado-Solís|title=The Kṛṣṇa Cycle in the Purāṇas: Themes and Motifs in a Heroic Saga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvCaWvjGDVEC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-0-89581-226-1|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heliodorus inscription is not an isolated evidence. Three Hathibada inscriptions and one Ghosundi inscription, all located in the state of [[Rajasthan]] and dated by modern methodology to the 1st{{nbsp}}century{{nbsp}}BCE, mention Samkarsana and Vasudeva, also mention that the structure was built for their worship.

This summary is a mythological account, based on literary details from the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', the ''[[Harivamsa]]'', the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', and the ''[[Vishnu Purana]]''. The scenes from the narrative are set in ancient [[India]], mostly in the present states of [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Haryana]], [[Delhi]], and [[Gujarat]]. The legends about Krishna's life are called ''Krishna charitas'' ([[IAST]]: Kṛṣṇacaritas).{{sfn|Matchett|2001|p=145}}

===Birth===

[[File:Indischer Maler um 1755 002.jpg|thumbnail|right|Nanda and Yashoda pushing baby Krishna on a swing]]

In ''Krishna Charitas'', Krishna is born to [[Devaki]] and her husband, King [[Vasudeva]] of the [[Yadava]] clan in [[Mathura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmUssUXUFFYC&amp;pg=PA359 |title=The Poems of Sūradāsa|publisher=Abhinav publications|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devaki's brother is a tyrant named [[Kamsa|Kansa]]. At Devaki's wedding, according to Puranic legends, Kansa is told by fortune tellers that a child of Devaki would kill him. Kansa arranges to kill all of Devaki's children. When Krishna is born, Vasudeva secretly carries the infant Krishna away across the Yamuna and exchanges him. When Kansa tries to kill the newborn, the exchanged baby appears as the Hindu goddess [[Durga]], warning him that his death has arrived in his kingdom, and then disappears, according to the legends in the Puranas. Krishna grows up with [[Nanda Baba]] and his wife [[Yasoda]] near modern-day [[Mathura]].&lt;ref name="yashoda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/sss/ho_1982.220.8.htm|title=Yashoda and Krishna|date=2011-10-10|publisher=Metmuseum.org|accessdate=2011-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013214426/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ho/07/sss/ho_1982.220.8.htm|archivedate=13 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tkk"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UiwMRwcT-kC |title=The Krishna key|date=2012|publisher=Westland|isbn=9789381626689|location=Chennai|page=Key7|language=en|last1=Sanghi|first1=Ashwin|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lok Nath Soni"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wT-BAAAAMAAJ |title=The Cattle and the Stick: An Ethnographic Profile of the Raut of Chhattisgarh|publisher=Anthropological Survey of India, Government of India, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Department of Culture, 2000 Original from the University of Michigan|year=2000|isbn=978-8185579573|location=Anthropological Survey of India, Government of India, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Department of Culture, Delhi|pages=16|author=Lok Nath Soni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Krishna's siblings also survive, namely [[Balarama]] and [[Subhadra]], according to these legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=124–130,224}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day of birth of Krishna is celebrated as [[Krishna Janmashtami]].

Other legends describe him as an enchanter and playful lover of the [[gopi]]s (milkmaids) of Vrindavana, especially [[Radha]]. These metaphor-filled love stories are known as the ''[[Rasa lila]]'' and were romanticised in the poetry of [[Jayadeva]], author of the [[Gita Govinda]]. They are also central to the development of the Krishna [[bhakti]] traditions worshiping [[Radha Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Schweig, G.

Krishna's childhood illustrates the Hindu concept of ''lila'', playing for fun and enjoyment and not for sport or gain. His interaction with the gopis at the rasa dance or [[Rasa-lila]] is an example. Krishna plays his flute and the gopis come immediately, from whatever they were doing, to the banks of the [[Yamuna River]], and join him in singing and dancing. Even those who could not physically be there join him through meditation. He is the spiritual essence and the love-eternal in existence, the gopis metaphorically represent the ''[[prakṛti]]'' matter and the impermanent body.&lt;ref&gt;Largen, Kristin Johnston.

This ''lila'' is a constant theme in the legends of Krishna's childhood and youth. Even when he is battling with a serpent to protect others, he is described in Hindu texts as if he were playing a game.&lt;ref&gt;Largen, Kristin Johnston. ''God at Play: Seeing God Through the Lens of the Young Krishna''. Wiley-Blackwell. 1{{nbsp}}September 2011. p.{{nbsp}}255.&lt;/ref&gt; This quality of playfulness in Krishna is celebrated during festivals as Rasa-lila and [[Janmashtami]], where Hindus in some regions such as [[Maharashtra]] playfully mimic his legends, such as by making human gymnastic pyramids to break open ''handis'' (clay pots) hung high in the air to "steal" butter or buttermilk, spilling it all over the group.&lt;ref&gt;Largen, Kristin Johnston.

===Kurukshetra War and ''Bhagavad Gita''===

{{Main article|Kurukshetra War|Bhagavad Gita}}
[[File:Krishna tells Gota to Arjuna.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Krishna tells the Gita to Arjuna.]]

According to the epic poem ''Mahabharata'', Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the [[Kurukshetra War]], but on the condition that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom and put down his ''[[Gandiva|Gandiv]]'' (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita, by Robert N.

===Death and ascension===

[[File:Death of Krishna - Illustrations from the Barddhaman edition of Mahabharata.jpg|thumb|The hunter Jara about to shoot arrow towards Krishna]]

{{main article|Mausala Parva}}
It is stated in the Indian texts that the legendary Kurukshetra War leads to the death of all the hundred sons of Gandhari. After Duryodhana's death, Krishna visits Gandhari to offer his condolences when Gandhari and Drutarashtra visited Kurukshtra, as stated in Stree Parva. Feeling that Krishna deliberately did not put an end to the war, in a fit of rage and sorrow Gandhari said, 'Thou were indifferent to the Kurus and the Pandavas whilst they slew each other, therefore, O Govinda, thou shalt be the slayer of thy own kinsmen !' According to the ''Mahabharata'', a fight breaks out at a festival among the Yadavas, who end up killing each other. Mistaking the sleeping Krishna for a deer, a hunter named Jara shoots an arrow that fatally injures him. Krishna forgives Jara and dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bryant|2007|pp=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eck380&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana L.

There are numerous versions of Krishna's life story, of which three are most studied: the ''Harivamsa'', the ''Bhagavata Purana'', and the ''Vishnu Purana''.{{sfn| Matchett|2001|pp=9–14, 145–149}} They share the basic storyline but vary significantly in their specifics, details, and styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamín Preciado-Solís|title=The Kṛṣṇa Cycle in the Purāṇas: Themes and Motifs in a Heroic Saga |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JvCaWvjGDVEC&amp;pg=PA40 |year=1984|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-0-89581-226-1|page=40}}, Quote: "Within a period of four or five centuries [around the start of the common era], we encounter our major sources of information, all in different versions. The Mahabharata, the Harivamsa, the Visnu Purana, the Ghata Jataka, and the Bala Carita all appear between the first and the fifth century AD, and each of them represents a tradition of a Krsna cycle different from the others".&lt;/ref&gt; The most original composition, the ''Harivamsa'' is told in a realistic style that describes Krishna's life as a poor herder but weaves in poetic and [[Allusion|allusive]] fantasy. It ends on a triumphal note, not with the death of Krishna.{{sfn| Matchett|2001|pp=145, 44–49, 63–64}} Differing in some details, the fifth book of the ''Vishnu Purana'' moves away from ''Harivamsa'' realism and embeds Krishna in mystical terms and eulogies.{{sfn| Matchett|2001|pp=146, 89–104}} The ''Vishnu Purana'' manuscripts exist in many versions.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=18, 245–249}}

The tenth and eleventh books of the ''Bhagavata Purana'' are widely considered to be a poetic masterpiece, full of imagination and metaphors, with no relation to the realism of pastoral life found in the ''Harivamsa''. Krishna's life is presented as a cosmic play (''lila''), where his youth is set as a princely life with his foster father Nanda portrayed as a king.{{sfn| Matchett|2001|pp=146–147, 108–115}} Krishna's life is closer to that of a human being in ''Harivamsa'', but is a symbolic universe in the ''Bhagavata Purana'', where Krishna is within the universe and beyond it, as well as the universe itself, always.{{sfn| Matchett|2001|pp=145–149}} The ''Bhagavata Purana'' manuscripts also exist in many versions, in numerous Indian languages.{{Sfn|Rocher|1986|pp=138–149}}{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=112}}

According to Guy Beck, "most scholars of Hinduism and Indian history accept the historicity of Krishna - that he was a real male person, whether human or divine, who lived on Indian soil by at least 1000 BCE and interacted with many other historical persons within the cycles of the epic and puranic histories."

===Vaishnavism===

{{Main article|Vaishnavism}}
{{Vaishnavism}}
The worship of Krishna is part of [[Vaishnavism]], a major tradition within Hinduism. Krishna is considered a full avatar of Vishnu, or one with Vishnu himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=John Dowson |title=Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History and Literature |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |location= |year=2003 |page= 361|isbn=0-7661-7589-8| url = https://books.google.com/?id=6JB-KOXy5k8C&amp;pg=PA361&amp;dq=Vishnu+Sahasranama+Krishna}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact relationship between Krishna and Vishnu is complex and diverse,&lt;ref name = Beck&gt;See Beck, Guy, ''"Introduction"'' in {{Harvnb|Beck|2005|pp=1–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Krishna sometimes considered an independent deity and supreme.&lt;ref name=Knott55&gt;{{Harvnb|Knott|2000|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaishnavas accept many incarnations of Vishnu, but Krishna is particularly important. Their theologies are generally centered either on Vishnu or an avatar such as Krishna as supreme. The terms Krishnaism and Vishnuism have sometimes been used to distinguish the two, the former implying that Krishna is the transcendent Supreme Being.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p =117}}

All Vaishnava traditions recognise Krishna as the eighth avatar of Vishnu; others identify Krishna with Vishnu, while traditions such as [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]],&lt;ref name = McDaniel&gt;See McDaniel, June, ''"Folk Vaishnavism and {{IAST|Ṭhākur Pañcāyat}}: Life and status among village Krishna statues"'' in {{Harvnb|Beck|2005|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kennedy1925&gt;{{cite book| author = Kennedy, M.

===Bhakti tradition===
{{Main article|Bhakti movement|Bhakti yoga}}
[[File:Meerabai (crop).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Krishna has been a major part of the [[Bhakti movement]].]]
The use of the term bhakti, meaning devotion, is not confined to any one deity.

The bhakti movements devoted to Krishna became prominent in southern India in the 7th to 9th{{nbsp}}centuries CE.

[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|upright|Krishna (left) with Radha at [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]], [[Watford]], England]]
The movement originated in South India during the 7th{{nbsp}}CE, spreading northwards from Tamil Nadu through Karnataka and Maharashtra; by the 15th{{nbsp}}century, it was established in Bengal and northern India.{{sfnp|Schomer|McLeod|1987|pp=1–2|ps=}} Early Bhakti pioneers include [[Nimbarka]] (12th or 13th{{nbsp}}century CE),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nimbarka-Indian-philosopher Nimbarka], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; but most emerged later, including [[Vallabhacharya]] (15th{{nbsp}}century CE) and ([[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Lord Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. They started their own schools, namely [[Nimbarka Sampradaya]], [[Vallabha Sampradaya]], and [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], with Krishna as the supreme god.

In the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], particularly in [[Maharashtra]], saint poets of the [[Varkari]] sect such as [[Dnyaneshwar]], [[Namdev]], [[Janabai]], [[Eknath]], and [[Tukaram]] promoted the worship of [[Vithoba]],&lt;ref name = "vithoba"/&gt; a local form of Krishna, from the beginning of the 13th{{nbsp}}century until the late 18th{{nbsp}}century.&lt;ref name=" Mahony1987" /&gt; In southern India, [[Purandara Dasa]] and [[Kanakadasa]] of [[Karnataka]] composed songs devoted to the Krishna image of [[Udupi]]. [[Rupa Goswami]] of Gaudiya Vaishnavism has compiled a comprehensive summary of bhakti called Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu.&lt;ref name = "Klostermaier1974"/&gt;

In South India, the acharyas of the Sri Sampradaya have written reverentially about Krishna in most of their works, including the [[Thiruppavai]] by Andal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thiruppavai|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/tpv/|work=Ibiblio|accessdate=2013-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gopala Vimshati by [[Vedanta Desika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Desika|first=Vedanta|title=Gopala Vimshati|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/vdesikan/gopala_vimsati/index.html|work=Ibiblio, Sripedia|accessdate=2013-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Outside Asia====
[[File:New Mayapur - 30.jpg|thumb|An ISKCON temple in [[Luçay-le-Mâle]], France]]
By 1965 the ''Krishna-bhakti'' movement had spread outside India after [[Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]] (as instructed by his [[guru]], [[Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakura]]) traveled from his homeland in West Bengal to [[New York City]]. A year later in 1966, after gaining many followers, he was able to form the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] (ISKCON), popularly known as the Hare Krishna movement. The purpose of this movement was to write about Krishna in English and to share the [[Gaudiya Vaishnava]] philosophy with people in the Western world by spreading the teachings of the saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]]. In the biographies of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, the mantra he received when he was given [[diksha]] or initiation in [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] was the six-word verse of the ''[[Kali-Saṇṭāraṇa Upaniṣad|Kali-Santarana Upanishad]]'', namely "Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna Hare Hare; Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama Hare Hare". In Gaudiya tradition, it is the ''maha-mantra'', or great mantra, about Krishna [[bhakti]].{{Sfn|Bryant|2013|p=42}}&lt;ref&gt;Alanna Kaivalya (2014), Sacred Sound: Discovering the Myth and Meaning of Mantra and Kirtan, New World, {{ISBN|978-1608682430}}, pages 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; Its chanting was known as ''hari-nama sankirtana''.&lt;ref&gt;''Srila Prabhupada — He Built a House in which the whole world can live in peace'', Satsvarupa dasa Goswami, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, 1984, {{ISBN|0-89213-133-0}} page xv&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian dance and music theatre traces its origins and techniques to the ancient ''[[Samaveda|Sama Veda]]'' and ''[[Natyasastra]]'' texts.{{Sfn|Beck|1993|pp=107–108}}&lt;ref&gt;PV Kane, History of Sanskrit Poetics, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802742}} (2015 Reprint), pages 10–41&lt;/ref&gt; The stories enacted and the numerous choreographic themes are inspired by the mythologies and legends in Hindu texts, including Krishna-related literature such as ''[[Harivamsa]]'' and ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]''.{{sfn|Varadpande|1987|pages=92–94}}

The Krishna stories have played a key role in the history of Indian theatre, music, and dance, particularly through the tradition of [[Rasa leela|''Rasaleela'']]. These are dramatic enactments of Krishna's childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. One common scene involves Krishna playing flute in rasa leela, only to be heard by certain gopis (cowheard maidens), which is theologically supposed to represent divine call only heard by certain enlightened beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vemsani |first1=Lavanya |title=Krishna in history thought and culture |url= https://books.google.com/?id=4fw2DAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |year=2016 |publisher=ABC-Clio LLC|location=California |language=en |isbn=978-1-61069-210-6|pages=179–180 |chapter=Music and Krishna }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the text's legends have inspired secondary theatre literature such as the eroticism in [[Gita Govinda]].&lt;ref&gt;Graham Schweig ( 2007), Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions (Editor: Yudit Kornberg Greenberg), Volume{{nbsp}}1, {{ISBN|978-1851099801}}, pages 247–249&lt;/ref&gt;

Krishna-related literature such as the ''Bhagavata Purana'' accords a metaphysical significance to the performances and treats them as religious ritual, infusing daily life with spiritual meaning, thus representing a good, honest, happy life. Similarly, Krishna-inspired performances aim to cleanse the hearts of faithful actors and listeners. Singing, dancing, and performance of any part of ''Krishna Lila'' is an act of remembering the dharma in the text, as a form of ''para bhakti'' (supreme devotion). To remember Krishna at any time and in any art, asserts the text, is to worship the good and the divine.{{sfn|Varadpande|1987|pages=95–97}}

Classical dance styles such as [[Kathak]], [[Odissi dance|Odissi]], [[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]], [[Kuchipudi]] and [[Bharatnatyam]] in particular are known for their Krishna-related performances.{{sfn|Varadpande|1987|page=98}} [[Krisnattam]] (Krishnattam) traces its origins to Krishna legends, and is linked to another major classical Indian dance form called [[Kathakali]].&lt;ref name=Zarrilli2000&gt;{{cite book|author = Zarrilli, P.

===Jainism===

The [[Jainism]] tradition lists 63 ''[[Śalākāpuruṣa]]'' or notable figures which, amongst others, includes the twenty-four ''[[Tirthankara]]s'' (spiritual teachers) and nine sets of triads. One of these triads is Krishna as the ''Vasudeva'', [[Balarama]] as the ''[[Balabhadra|Baladeva]]'', and [[Jarasandha]] as the ''Prati-Vasudeva''. In each age of the Jain cyclic time is born a ''Vasudeva'' with an elder brother termed the ''Baladeva''.  Between the triads, ''Baladeva'' upholds the principle of non-violence, a central idea of Jainism. The villain is the ''Prati-vasudeva'', who attempts to destroy the world. To save the world, ''Vasudeva-Krishna'' has to forsake the non-violence principle and kill the ''Prati-Vasudeva''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Jaini|first=P. S.|authorlink=Padmanabh Jaini|date=1993|title=Jaina Puranas: A Puranic Counter Tradition|isbn=978-0-7914-1381-4|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&amp;pg=PA207}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories of these triads can be found in the ''[[Harivamsa Purana]]'' (8th{{nbsp}}century CE) of [[Jinasena]] (not be confused with its namesake, the addendum to ''Mahābhārata'') and the ''Trishashti-shalakapurusha-charita'' of [[Hemachandra]].{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=26}}&lt;ref name = Jer&gt;See Jerome H. Bauer "Hero of Wonders, Hero in Deeds: [https://books.google.com/books?id=0SJ73GHSCF8C&amp;pg=PA151 "Vasudeva Krishna in Jaina Cosmohistory]" in {{Harvnb|Beck|2005|pp=167–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of Krishna's life in the ''Puranas'' of Jainism follows the same general outline as those in the Hindu texts, but in details they are very different: they include Jain ''Tirthankaras'' as characters in the story, and generally are polemically critical of Krishna, unlike the versions found in the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Bhagavata Purana'', and the ''Vishnu Purana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cort| first=J. E.|date=1993|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=An Overview of the Jaina Puranas, in Purana Perennis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&amp;pg=PA191 |pages=220–233 |isbn=9781438401362}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Krishna loses battles in the Jain versions, and his ''gopis'' and his clan of Yadavas die in a fire created by an ascetic named Dvaipayana. Similarly, after dying from the hunter Jara's arrow, the Jaina texts state Krishna goes to the [[Naraka (Jainism)|third hell]] in [[Jain cosmology]], while his brother is said to go to the [[Svarga (Jainism)|sixth heaven]].&lt;ref name="Glasenapp1999p317"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helmuth von Glasenapp|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA317 |year=1999|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1376-2|pages=316–318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vimalasuri is attributed to be the author of the Jain version of the ''Harivamsa Purana'', but no manuscripts have been found that confirm this. It is likely that later Jain scholars, probably Jinasena of the 8th{{nbsp}}century, wrote a complete version of Krishna legends in the Jain tradition and credited it to the ancient Vimalasuri.&lt;ref name=Cort1993&gt;{{citation|last=Cort| first=J. E.|date=1993|editor=Wendy Doniger|title=An Overview of the Jaina Puranas, in Purana Perennis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&amp;pg=PA191 |page=191 |isbn=9781438401362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial and older versions of the Krishna story are available in Jain literature, such as in the ''Antagata Dasao'' of the ''[[Svetambara]]'' ''Agama'' tradition.&lt;ref name=Cort1993/&gt;

In other Jain texts, Krishna is stated to be a cousin of the twenty-second ''[[Tirthankara]]'', [[Neminatha]]. The Jain texts state that Naminatha taught Krishna all the wisdom that he later gave to Arjuna in the ''Bhagavad Gita''. According to [[Jeffery D. Long]], a professor of religion known for his publications on Jainism, this connection between Krishna and Neminatha has been a historic reason for Jains to accept, read, and cite the ''Bhagavad Gita'' as a spiritually important text, celebrate Krishna-related festivals, and intermingle with Hindus as spiritual cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffery D. Long|title=Jainism: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JmRlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA42 |year= 2009|publisher =I. B. Tauris|isbn= 978-1-84511-625-5|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhism===

The story of Krishna occurs in the [[Jataka]] tales in [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vipassana.info/ay/andhakavenhu_puttaa.htm|title = Andhakavenhu Puttaa|publisher = www.vipassana.info|accessdate = 2008-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Vidhurapandita Jataka'' mentions ''Madhura'' (Sanskrit: Mathura), the ''Ghata Jataka'' mentions Kamsa, Devagabbha (Sk: Devaki), Upasagara or Vasudeva, Govaddhana (Sk: Govardhana), Baladeva (Balarama), and Kanha or Kesava (Sk: Krishna, Keshava).&lt;ref name=Law1941&gt;{{cite book|author = Law, B. C.|year = 1941|title = India as Described in Early Texts of Buddhism and Jainism|publisher = Luzac|url =https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.513920/2015.513920.India-as#page/n5/mode/2up|pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jaiswal&gt;{{cite journal|author = Jaiswal, S.|year = 1974|title = Historical Evolution of the Ram Legend|journal = Social Scientist|jstor = 3517633|volume = 21|issue = 3–4|pages = 89–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like the Jaina versions of the Krishna legends, the Buddhist versions such as one in ''Ghata Jataka'' follow the general outline of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G.P. Malalasekera|title=Dictionary of Pali Proper Names|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=x8ObMQ1GGsUC&amp;pg=PA439|year=2003|publisher=Asian Educational Services|isbn=978-81-206-1823-7|page=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are different from the Hindu versions as well.&lt;ref name=Law1941/&gt;{{sfn|Bryant|2007|p=6}} For example, the Buddhist legend describes Devagabbha (Devaki) to have been isolated in a palace built upon a pole, after she is born, so no future husband could reach her. Krishna's father similarly is described as a powerful king, but who meets up with Devagabbha anyway, and to whom Kamsa gives away his sister Devagabbha in marriage. The siblings of Krishna are not killed by Kamsa, though he tries. In the Buddhist version of the legend, all of Krishna's siblings grow to maturity.&lt;ref name= Francis314/&gt;

Krishna and his siblings' capital becomes Dvaravati. The Arjuna and Krishna interaction is missing in the Jataka version. A new legend is included, wherein Krishna laments in uncontrollable sorrow when his son dies, and a Ghatapandita feigns madness to teach Krishna a lesson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gunapala Piyasena Malalasekera|title=Dictionary of Pāli Proper Names: A-Dh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=up5O9zrSX80C&amp;pg=PA825 |year=2007|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3021-9|pages=825–826}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jataka tale also includes an internecine destruction among his siblings after they all get drunk. Krishna also dies in the Buddhist legend by the hand of a hunter named Jara, but while he is traveling to a frontier city. Mistaking Krishna for a pig, Jara throws a spear that fatally pierces his feet, causing Krishna great pain and then his death.&lt;ref name= Francis314&gt;{{cite book|author1=H. T. Francis|author2=E.

At the end of this ''Ghata-Jataka'' discourse, the Buddhist text declares that [[Sariputta]], one of the revered disciples of the Buddha in the Buddhist tradition, was incarnated as Krishna in his previous life to learn lessons on grief from the Buddha in his prior rebirth:

{{Quote|Then he [Master] declared the Truths, and identified the Birth: 'At that time, Ananda was Rohineyya, Sariputta was Vasudeva [Krishna], the followers of the Buddha were the other persons, and I myself was Ghatapandita."

While the Buddhist Jataka texts co-opt Krishna-Vasudeva and make him a student of the [[Buddha]] in his previous life,&lt;ref name=cowell57/&gt; the Hindu texts co-opt the Buddha and make him an [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel E Bassuk |title=Incarnation in Hinduism and Christianity: The Myth of the God-Man |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k3iwCwAAQBAJ |date= 1987 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=978-1-349-08642-9 |pages=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Edward Geoffrey Parrinder|title=Avatar and Incarnation: The Divine in Human Form in the World's Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkV5AAAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Oxford: Oneworld|isbn=978-1-85168-130-3|pages=19–24, 35–38, 75–78, 130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'divine boy' Krishna as an embodiment of wisdom and endearing prankster forms a part of the pantheon of gods in [[Japanese Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 42, No. 1 (Spring, 1987 ), pp. 1–23|last = Guth|first = C.

'''Lulu M. Hefner''' (or Heffner, b. August 9, 1874 and d. July 19, 1954) was a [[Cherokee people|Cherokee]] businessperson from [[Nowata, Oklahoma]]. She is known as the first woman to drill a producing [[oil well]] on her own property, and the first female [[Oil in Oklahoma|oil operator in Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=starr1921 /&gt; As of 1821, Hefner had drilled 28 successful wells, managed a motion picture theater, and owned the largest garage in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Independent Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zBFAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT120|year=1921|publisher=National Federation of Business and Professional Women's Clubs|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was active in the civic and social affairs of the Nowata community. Her initial business in Nowata was the town's first [[millinery]] store.

Lula May, the daughter of James Marion and Annie Henrietta (Prather) Tittle, was born August 9, 1874, and educated at [[Vinita, Oklahoma]] and the [[Cherokee Female Seminary]]. She married John Emory Heffner at [[Lenapah, Oklahoma]] on December 29, 1892. They had four children: Roy Emory, born March 13, 1903, Edith Lena, born December 18, 1905; Helen K., born October 2, 1905 and Ruby L., born January 20, 1907.&lt;ref name=starr1921&gt;{{Cite book

'''Mahnaz Afkhami''' ({{lang-fa|مهناز افخمی}}) is an Iranian [[women's rights activist]] who served in the [[Cabinet of Iran]] from 1976 to 1978.

She is Founder and President of [[Women's learning partnership|Women's Learning Partnership]] (WLP), the Executive Director of the [[Foundation for Iranian Studies]]&lt;ref name="FIS staff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff &amp;#124; Foundation for Iranian Studies |url=http://fis-iran.org/en/about/staff |publisher=[[Foundation for Iranian Studies]] |accessdate=2013-03-09 |location=Bethesda, MD, USA |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117035840/http://fis-iran.org/en/about/staff |archivedate=2012-11-17 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the former Minister of Women's Affairs in [[Iran]]'s pre-[[Iranian Revolution|Revolution]] government.&lt;ref name="Jecks"&gt;{{cite news |first=Nicki |last=Jecks |title='I Was Iran's Last Minister' |date=August 19, 2009 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8207371.stm |work=[[BBC World Service]] |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has lived in exile in the United States since 1979.

Having founded and headed several international [[non-governmental organization]]s focused on advancing the status of women,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Ann |last=Hill |title=International Women's Rights Advocate Mahnaz Afkhami to Speak at Wellesley College April 6 |date=April 5, 2005 |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Releases/2005/040505.html |work=[[Wellesley College]] Office for Public Affairs |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afkhami has been an advocate of [[women's rights]] since the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Judith |last=Latham |title=Women's Learning Partnership's Goal Is to Empower Women, Says President of the Organization |date=June 11, 2008 |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2008-06-09-voa41.html |work=[[VOA News]] |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has lectured and published extensively on the international [[women's movement]], women's [[human rights]], women in [[leadership]], women and [[technology]], the status of women in [[Muslim world|Muslim-majority societies]] and on women's participation in [[civil society]]-building and [[democratization]]. Her books have been translated into multiple languages and distributed internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://word.world-citizenship.org/wp-archive/494 |title=Mahnaz Afkhami - Iran |publisher=World People's Blog |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learningpartnership.org/publications/training/ltc |title=Leading To Choices Manuals |publisher=Women's Learning Partnership |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activism ==

===Leadership and political participation===
At 17, Afkhami joined a trade union and successfully challenged a breach of her rights as a worker when an employer laid her off temporarily then rehired her to avoid paying for the vacation she had earned.&lt;ref name="Afkhami 2003"/&gt; She credits this incident with giving her the belief that organizing could bring about social change.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

In 1975, Afkhami was asked to join the cabinet of the Iranian government and became Minister of Women's Affairs.&lt;ref name="Jecks"/&gt; The post had not existed in Iran before and the only other person holding such a position was [[Françoise Giroud]] in [[France]].

In 2001, Afkhami published [http://www.learningpartnership.org/ltc Leading to Choices: A Leadership Training Handbook for Women] to encourage women to be leaders in their families, communities, and countries. It has been translated into 20 languages. In 2010, she published [http://www.learningpartnership.org/lta ''Leading to Action: A Political Participation Handbook for Women'']. The manuals have been used for training around the world, reaching thousands.

Afkhami and her sister Farah Abrahimi were featured in the [[PBS]] series [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYcL5WU7ACY ''Destination America''] in 2005. At the time Afkhami became Minister of Women's Affairs, her sister was a leader in the students' movement demanding the overthrow of the [[Shah]] [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]].

===Gender equality===
In 1969, two years after returning to Iran as a professor of literature and Chair of the Department of English at the National University of Iran, Afkhami was drawn into Iran's women's movement and founded the Association of University Women. In 1970, she became the secretary general of the Women's Organization of Iran (WOI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Liane |last=Hansen |title=Executed But Not Forgotten: Iran's Farrokhroo Parsay |date=August 23, 2009 |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=112150486 |work=[[NPR]] |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remained there for ten years, during which time she worked for Iranian women's rights.&lt;ref name="Afkhami 2003"/&gt;

While Afkhami was Minister of Women's Affairs, Iran's legislation granted women equal rights as regards divorce; raised the minimum age of marriage; supported women's employment with maternity leave and childcare provision; and built upon the family laws of 1967.&lt;ref name="Afkhami 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Noushin |last=Ahmadi Khorasani |title=The Fate of the Family Protection Law |date=October 14, 2008 |url=http://feministschool.org/english/spip.php?article158 |work=[http://feministschool.org The Feminist School] |accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afkhami has served as a member of Iran's High Council of Family Planning and Welfare and on the boards of trustees of Kerman University and Farah University for Women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://womenministers.government.is/Programme//nr/3236 |title=Special Meeting of Women Ministers of Culture: Keynote Speaker Biography |publisher=Special Meeting of Women Ministers of Culture - Reykjavik 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has written that "[w]omen's empowerment is a process, a holistic approach that involves raising consciousness, building skills and reforming unjust laws that limit women's education, their employment, their participation in decision making and, above all, their opportunities for economic independence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/2009/freedom-leads-to-empowerment/ Freedom leads to empowerment]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exile and involvement in the international women's movement===
When Iran's [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] began in 1979, Afkhami was at the United Nations in New York negotiating the establishment of the [[International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women]] (INSTRAW). She was charged ''[[:wikt:in absentia|in absentia]]'' with "Corruption on Earth and warring with God." She has never returned to Iran, living instead in exile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Afkhami |first=Mahnaz |title=Women In Exile |url=http://www.learningpartnership.org/mafkhami2/1994/women-in-exile/ |location= |publisher=The University Press of Virginia |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-8139-1543-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she has said she would like to return to help rebuild Iran if its political system changed.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite news |title=Destination America: Mahnaz Afkhami &amp; Farah Ebrahimi: Iran |date=October 1, 2005 |url=https://www.pbs.org/destinationamerica/ps_ctn_02.html# |work=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She contributed the piece "A future in the past, the prerevolutionary women's movement" to the 1984 anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology]]'', edited by [[Robin Morgan]].&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.vsc.edu/lscfind/Record/154795/TOC#tabnav |title=Table of Contents: Sisterhood is global : |publisher=Catalog.vsc.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1994, she published [https://books.google.com/books/about/Women_in_exile.html?id=t7VFxrziOSQC ''Women in Exile''], a collection of portraits of activist women in political exile.

Afkhami then joined the international women's rights movement, saying: "The conditions women have in common outrank and outvalue those that set them apart."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/1995/faith-and-freedom-introduction/&lt;/ref&gt; She became an advisor to [[Human Rights Watch]] and the Vice-President and Executive Director of [The Sisterhood is Global?].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sigi.org/about.html |title=About The Sisterhood Is Global Institute |publisher=Sisterhood Is Global Institute |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, she has written [http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/1996/towards-global-feminism-a-muslim-perspective/ ''Towards Global Feminism''].

Afkhami has served on a number of boards and committees of international organizations including the Steering Committee of the [[World Movement for Democracy]] (1999-2010), the [[International League for Human Rights]] (2000-2006), the [[Global Fund for Women]] (1998-2007), [[Gender At Work]] (2003-2008),  Women Leaders Intercultural Forum (2010) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Women Leaders Intercultural Forum Addresses Global Security |date=October 26, 2006 |url=http://www.realizingrights.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=217 |work=Realizing Rights: The Ethical Globalization Initiative (2002-2010)|accessdate=April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Global Women's Action Network for Children (2006-2009).,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdf.childrensdefense.org/site/PageServer?pagename=gwanc_home |title=The Global Women's Action Network for Children |publisher=Children's Defense Fund |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global Fund for Women]] (1998-2007),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/cms/spanish/consejeras.html |title=Global Fund for Women - Consejeras |publisher=Global Fund for Women |accessdate=2010-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401091752/http://www.globalfundforwomen.org/cms/spanish/consejeras.html |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Museum of Women]] (2000-2014),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imow.org/about/globalcouncil/index |title=Global Council - International Museum of Women |publisher=International Museum of Women |accessdate=2010-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521084638/http://www.imow.org/about/globalcouncil/index |archivedate=2010-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing Rights: The Ethical Globalization Initiative (2002-2010), and Women's Human Rights Net (2000-2004).

She currently serves on the Advisory Committee of the Women's Rights Division of [[Human Rights Watch]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/76172#_Women%27s_Rights |title=Human Rights Watch: Board of Directors |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Board of the [[Foundation for Iranian Studies]],&lt;ref name="FIS staff"/&gt; and the Board of Trustees for the Smithsonian's [[Freer Gallery of Art]] and [[Arthur M. Sackler Gallery]]

===Culture, Islam and universality of rights===
Afkhami believes that religion and [[feminism]] are not incompatible ([http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/2004/rights-of-passage/ "Women ought not to be forced to choose between freedom and God"]). Nonetheless, culture and religion can be problematic in terms of women's human rights: "We must pose the question: why is it that the denial of the most rudimentary rights to civil treatment for women is always based on some fundamental point of culture? Is this culture real, or is it a fetish that is used to maintain some economic, social, or simply psychological privilege?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/2009/women-and-culture/1999/a-vision-of-gender-in-culture A Vision of Gender in Culture]&lt;/ref&gt;

She has taken a stand against [[cultural relativism]] and Islamic [[exceptionalism]], stating clearly that human rights are universal and must supersede religious frameworks: "At the center of [the] conflict is the dilemma of Muslim women's human rights&amp;nbsp;– whether Muslim women have rights because they are human beings, or whether they have rights because they are Muslim women."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/1995/faith-and-freedom-introduction/ Faith and Freedom: Women's Human Rights in the Muslim World].

===Iranian Women's Movement===
Looking back on the changes which occurred in Iran just before the revolution, Afkhami said: "It seems to me that our main mistake was not that we did not do other things which we should have done. Our main mistake was that we created conditions in which the contradictions related to modernity, progress, equality, and human rights, especially women's rights, increased and the reaction to our work put perhaps too much pressure on the country's social fabric."&lt;ref name="Askary"&gt;{{cite news |first=Hooman |last=Askary |title=Fighting for Women's Rights: An Interview with Mahnaz Afkhami |date=November 16, 2011 |url=http://www.arsehsevom.net/2011/11/fighting-for-womens-rights-an-interview-with-mahnaz-afkhami/ |work=Arseh sevom civil society NGO website () |accessdate=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has publicly supported the Iranian [[One Million Signatures]] campaign to end discriminatory laws against women by promoting a book written by Iranian activist [[Noushin Ahmadi Khorasani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Judith |last=Latham |title=Iranian Women Campaign to End Discriminatory Laws Against Them |date=December 11, 2009 |url=http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/news-analysis/Iranian-Women-Campaign-to-End-Discriminatory-Laws-against-Them-79052162.html |work=[[VOA News]] |accessdate=April 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes that the movement is a new phase within a century-long cause.&lt;ref name="Askary"/&gt;

Afkhami's life and work in the women's movement in Iran, breaking with tradition, and living in exile are the topics of the 2012 [http://www.mahnazafkhami.net/2012/voa-extended-profile-in-persian/ ''Voice of America Persian biopic].

'''Abdelmalek "Malek" Boutih''' ({{IPA-fr|malɛk buˈti}}; born 27 October 1964) is a French retired politician and activist who served as a member of the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] from 2012 to 2017, representing the [[Essonne]] department. He previously was the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]]'s National Secretary for Social Issues (French: ''Secrétaire national chargé des questions de société'') from 2003 to 2008.

He also has had a long association with [[SOS Racisme]], a civil rights organisation with close ties to the Socialist Party. He joined in 1984 while a student at the [[Paris Nanterre University|University of Nanterre]] and served as Vice President from 1985 to 1992 and as President from 1999 to 2003. Boutih is known for his honesty and generosity; he is appreciated on both sides of the aisle for his patriotism and frankness. President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] asked him to enter the French Government in 2007 but he refused, preferring to focus on his social activism.

== Early life and education ==

Malek Boutih was born in a clinic in the wealthy neighbourhood of Neuilly-sur-Seine, although his family did not live there. He later chose to return to Neuilly-sur-Seine to attend La Folie-Saint-James high school (''[[Secondary education in France#Lyc.C3.A9e|lycée]]'').&lt;ref name="repdeslettres"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.republique-des-lettres.fr/10638-malek-boutih.php|title=Malek Boutih|last=republique-des-lettres.fr|work=republique-des-lettres.fr|access-date=2017-10-31|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born of [[Algeria]]n parents from [[Kabylie]]. His father was an [[National Liberation Front (Algeria)|FLN]] sympathiser and after independence, his parents went to France seeking work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Paris Alger: Une histoire passionnelle|last=Dubois|first=Christophe|last2=Tabet|first2=Marie-Christine|publisher=Stock|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked in the building industry and his mother as a cleaner. At the age of 9 months old he contracted [[poliomyelitis]] while his family was living in the [[slum]]s of [[Nanterre]],&lt;ref name="polio"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lirelactu.fr/source/le-parisien/71b76bd0-8923-4fdf-9b14-108af4d2016e|last=Méréo|first=Florence|work=Le Parisien|title=" Ma vie a basculé à cause d'un verre d'eau "|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later, [[Boulogne-Billancourt]]. He endured multiple operations until the age of 12 years. As a Deputy, he gave financial support to the Antony rehabilitation centre where he was cared for as a child.&lt;ref name="polio"/&gt;

== Activism ==

At the beginning of his study of Law at the University of Nanterre and at the ''École supérieure de journalism de Paris'', he became involved in activism and community work. In 1983 he took part in the [[March for Equality and Against Racism]]. Joining SOS Racisme in 1984, he became its vice-president from 1985 to 1992 and founded the [[Grigny, Essonne|Grigny]] ''Maison des Potes'' ("mate's house" — emergency accommodation) and the ''Banlieues du Monde'' association. He was editor-in-chief of the newspaper ''Pote à Pote'' ("Mate to Mate") for several years.

On 6 February 1990, he appeared on the TV talk show ''[[Ciel, mon mardi !]]'', a program that specialised in confrontation between people with opposing views.

His time as head of SOS Racisme was marked by the creation of the discrimination test and the first convictions in cases against racial [[discrimination]] in employment, housing and entry to night clubs. His greatest triumph being the validation of the use of discrimination tests by the [[Court of Cassation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.humanite.fr/node/266788|title=La pratique du testing validée par la Cour de cassation|date=2002-06-12|work=[[L'Humanité]]|first=Émilie|last=Rive|access-date=2017-11-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fight against racism and its rooks, he focussed on education at tackled urban ghettos with two priorities: mixing the population and fighting against violence. Finally, in 2002 he was one of the first to sound the alarm on the rise of [[anti-semitism]] in France, in the guise of [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/societe/20030326.OBS8611/sos-racisme-sonne-l-alerte.html|title=SOS-Racismesonne l'alerte|work=[[L'Obs]] (Nouvel Observateur)|access-date=2017-11-02|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A regular critic of its elder, rival anti-racism organisation [[MRAP]], in 2003 Malek Boutih declared "that there are several kinds of anti-racism in France, notable that of MRAP who march to cries of 'Death to the Jews!'". In September 2006, he was convicted, fined €1,000 and order to pay €1 damages by the Paris [[Tribunal correctionnel (France)|''tribunal correctionel'']] for defamation of MRAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/societe/2006/09/15/malek-boutih-condamne-pour-diffamation_51379|title=Malek Boutih condamné pour diffamation|work=[[Libération]].fr|access-date=2017-11-02|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He takes a position against separatism, ghetto mentality&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=4TV2HAAACAAJ&amp;dq=LA+FRANCE+AUX+FRAN%C3%87AIS+?+CHICHE+!&amp;cd=1|title=La France aux Français?: Chiche!|last=Boutih|first=Malek|last2=Lévy|first2=Elisabeth|date=2001|publisher=Mille et une nuits|isbn=9782842055646|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and positive discrimination. He states:

{{Quote|In France, minorities do not exist! We are not a threatened species. And if we [all] start speaking Arabic or Mandingo, or Breton or Corsican we will break apart the national community. France is the baguette, wine, cheese and now couscous, as well as 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity'. Two hundred years ago we got a head start in creating a political, rather than ethnic, national identity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Figaro]]'' - 10 juillet 2000&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] came into force on 1 December 2009, there has been a legal basis for the protection of minorities in Europe and hence in France.

For Malek Boutih, the children of immigrants have taken root in French society. They are French. To affirm that national identity is a sort of political rallying cry for that generation. Thus he hopes to persuade young people who are French, but have been convinced by the signals they are given (they are blacks, they are Arabs [''Beurs'']…) that they are not French, indeed they cannot even claim to be. According to him, France must finally recognize that integration has well and truly taken place and the country is now of mixed blood. He condemns religious extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.histoiresdememoire.org/spip.php?article171|title=Interview de Malek Boutih|last=Sabatier|first=Benoît|date=June 2005|work=Technikart|issue=n°93|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226024124/http://www.histoiresdememoire.org/spip.php?article171|archive-date=2008-12-26|access-date=2017-11-02|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his time as head of SOS Racisme, he conducted an ongoing fight against violence in poor suburbs which he branded "self-destructive and nihilist" in his ''Propositions pour un véritable Plan Marshall pour les [[Banlieue]]s'' ("Proposals for a real Marshall Plan for the Suburbs")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.herodote.org/article.php3?id_article=94|title=SOS Racisme et les " ghettos des banlieues " : Construction et utilisations d'une représentation|last=Robine|first=Jérémy|date=2004|work=''Hérodote:'' revue de géographie de de géopolitique|access-date=2017-11-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122083811/http://www.herodote.org/article.php3?id_article=94|archive-date=2009-01-22|dead-url=yes|issue=113 - Territoires de Pouvoirs en France (second trimestre 2004)|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was preventing the emancipation of a generation and could only end in failure. He refused to support violence as being the only response to marginalisation and preferred political, trade-union and community actions. Only the political commitment of that generation would allow the spiral of violence to end, according to him, and along with it the ethnic and geographic discrimination they suffered.

== Politics ==

A member of the Socialist Party since 1986, when his leadership of SOS Racisme ended he was appointed to the party's national hierarchy at the 2003 [[Dijon Congress|Congress of Dijon]] as National Secretary for Social Issues, a post that did not previously exist, despite never having had an elected position. The post was renewed at the [[Le Mans Congress]] in 2005. He had responsibility for [[immigration]], the fight against racism, AIDS and drug addiction.

He wrote a report on immigration, ''Une nouvelle politique de l'immigration'' (2004) ("A new politics of immigration"), called for by the national leadership of the party to define an official line on the subject. His goal was to convince the public that immigration was an essential contribution to France when it was properly controlled and organised. He declared himself in favour of quotas in line with a strategy of [[codevelopment]] creating a legal stream of immigration and regulating flows of migrants. This report was distributed by the Socialist Party leadership.&lt;ref name="minorites-17793"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.minorites.org/article.php?IDA%3D17793|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226022816/http://www.minorites.org/article.php?IDA=17793 |dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-12-26|title=Malek Boutih: "Chez nous, c'est "Good Bye Lénine" !"|last=Mandraud|first=Isabelle|date=2007-06-25|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Le Mans Congress, faced with a social crisis and questions of national identity, he defended the ideal of a "mixed-blood [[Republic]]" (''République métissée''). According to him, {{Quote|It is the mixed-blood Republic that must be the new flag to unite the whole French population, which can make our nation not one that is pointed out because of its unrest, but as a country that, true to its historic tradition, again opens a new page of history which enables bringing people together,…which will lead to a hope in the world which will be an alternative to that shock of civilisations, to the technicalities of religions, to the shock of difference, but more than that to a convergence of aspirations.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://congres2005.parti-socialiste.fr/article.php3%3Fid_article=393.html|title=C'est la République métissée qui doit être notre nouveau drapeau.|last=Boutih|first=Malek|date=2005-11-19|website=Congrès du PS au Mans (Parti socialiste)|language=French|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110090351/http://congres2005.parti-socialiste.fr/article.php3?id_article=393.html|archive-date=2008-01-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-11-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively he believes that the Republic is an idea that cannot remain fixed and that it should lean towards an ideal which "brings together the tradition of all that is best in French history, Republican history, but which also looks to the future, which accepts France's place in the world, which accepts the new generations of French people, which accepts diversity not as a handicap but as a treasure".

In his report on [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]], ''Cannabis : contrôler l'usage pour protéger les citoyens'' (2006) ("Cannabis: Controlling usage to protect citizens"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cannaweed.com/news/article-1030-boutih-imagine-nouvelle-filiere-agricole.html|title=Malek Boutih imagine une " nouvelle filière agricole "|last=Mandraud|first=Isabelle|date=2006-06-16|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=2017-11-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226015533/http://www.cannaweed.com/news/article-1030-boutih-imagine-nouvelle-filiere-agricole.html|archive-date=2008-12-26|dead-url=yes|language=French|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malek Boutih advocates taking public control of the market so as to combat the mafia, cannabis being, according to him, "the cornerstone of [[ghetto]]isation and insecurity in working-class neighbourhoods". This idea was taken into the platform of the Socialist Party in 2007 in the form of "public regulation".

Close to [[Julien Dray]], also a former member of SOS Racisme, he supported [[Ségolène Royal]] as Socialist Party candidate in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 French Presidential election]]. The new [[President of France|President]], [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], asked him to join his government, which he refused to do,&lt;ref&gt;''Sarkozy peaufine son ouverture'', ''[[Libération]]'', {{date|2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; affirming that there was no question of him "taking responsibilities in this government", all the while underlining "the reciprocal respect" which characterised his relationship with Nicolas Sarkozy.

He was not reappointed to the National Secretariat of the party in December 2008 and was summoned on 25 January 2009 by [[Pouria Amirshahi]] to clarify his attitude after his criticisms of the party's plan for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|financial crisis]] and his numerous accolades of Nicolas Sarkozy. "Malek Boutih should choose which side he's on."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/politique/20090125.OBS1372/malek_boutih_accuse_au_ps_detre_le_premier_des_sarkozys.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715060030/http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/politique/20090125.OBS1372/malek_boutih_accuse_au_ps_detre_le_premier_des_sarkozys.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 July 2012|title=Malek Boutih accusé au PS d'être le "premier des sarkozystes"|date=25 January 2009|work=[[L'Obs]]|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 Legislative elections ===

Malek Boutih was chosen as candidate for the [[Charente's 4th constituency]] in the [[French legislative election, 2007|2007 Legislative elections]] on 1 July 2006 at the national congress of the Socialist Party.

Almost all of the elected Socialists in the department made publicly known their hostility to his candidature and their willingness to block him since he was parachuted into the position.&lt;ref&gt;''Boutih, un parachuté vilipendé en Charente'', ''[[Libération]]'', {{date|13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The First Federal Secretary had effectively organised a consultative vote in the constituency between candidates [[Martine Pinville]] and Jeanne Filloux, before Malek Boutih's appointment. Selected by the local party members, Martine Pinville chose to keep her candidature with the official support of the Socialist Party, thus she was excluded at the national committee meeting of 22 May 2007, along with her alternate candidate, the outgoing Socialist deputy Jean-Claude Beauchaud.

Boutih was eliminated in the first round of the elections, coming third with 15.65% of the vote (9.54% of enrolled voters, although 12.5% was needed to progress to the second round), behind the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] Mayor of [[Angoulême]], Philippe Mottet (35.58% of the vote) and the dissident Socialist Martine Pinville (21.04%, 13% of enrolled voters). Boutih singled out the First Secretary François Hollande, accusing him of "throwing him to the wolves".&lt;ref&gt;''Malek Boutih (PS): «Hollande m'a envoyé au casse-pipe»'', [[Libération]], {{date|11 July 2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second round, the Socialist Party supported Martine Pinville who was elected with 57.03% of the vote.

He felt that he had been beaten by his own party&lt;ref name="minorites-17793" /&gt; and severely criticised its leaders "who formed a clique that disliked society as it was, who cannot see themselves as part of it and who cling to the melancholy of the 1970s. Where we come from it's Good Bye Lenin!" He rebuked them for having skimmed over the debate on diversity and not having taken it up seriously, like other subjects of real concern to French people: violence, work, the right to social emancipation, identity.

=== 2012 Legislative elections ===

Malek Boutih was chosen as a candidate in [[Essonne's 10th constituency]] following a vote of party members. He began his campaign using the words and images of [[Jean-Luc Mélenchon]] and in his campaign materials, despite Mélenchon supporting [[François Delapierre]], the candidate for the [[Left Front (France)|Left Front]] in the same constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jean-luc-melenchon.fr/2012/05/03/mise-au-point/|title=Communiqué du 03-05-12, Mise au point|website=www.jean-luc-melenchon.fr|date=2012-05-03|access-date=2017-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He led in the first round on 10 June 2012 with 34.56% of the vote and was elected on 17 June with 56.84% of the vote against the Radical Party candidate, Marianne Duranton (43.16%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://essonneinfo.fr/91-essonne-info/28123/lessonne-vire-a-gauche/|title=L'Essonne vire à gauche|date=2012-06-18|work=Essonne Info — Site d'actualité et d'information en Essonne|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/14/tribun/fiches_id/610045.asp|title=M.

=== Jihadism in France ===

In February 2015 the [[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]] [[Manuel Valls]] named Malek Boutih as parliamentarian assigned to consider the analysis and prevention of "new generations turning to terrorism in connection with [[Jihadism|jihadist]] networks".&lt;ref&gt;Lettre de mission du 26 février 2015, citée dans Rapport ''Génération radicale''&lt;/ref&gt; This report was handed over in June 2015, titled ''Génération radicale'' ("Radical Generation").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.youscribe.com/Product/DownloadFile/2589457?format=1&amp;key=d2064e274c0684e10268c25b4e33d6fac3217e78|title="Génération radicale" : rapport de Malek Boutih sur le djihadisme|last=YouScribe|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2015/07/02/01016-20150702ARTFIG00404-djihadisme-le-cri-d-alarme-de-malek-boutih.php|title=Djihadisme : le cri d'alarme de Malek Boutih|date=2015-07-02|work=[[Le Figaro]]|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its major conclusions was:

{{Quote|We no longer have the right to doubt, to quibble, to weigh up. The time has come for determined action to enforce the Republican project… Public action in response to radicalism must be part of a plan of counter-attack, giving the Republic all of its strength and all of its appeal.}}

Warmly welcomed by members of the opposition, but more discretely by the Socialist majority, this report was criticised especially for its sources, such as [[Frigide Barjot|Frigid Barjot]]&lt;ref name="LibéTableauNoir"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/france/2015/07/03/malek-boutih-dresse-un-tableau-noir-de-la-jeunesse_1342694|title=Malek Boutih dresse un tableau noir de la jeunesse|first=Jérémie|last=Lamothe|work=[[Libération]].fr|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the prominence granted to [[Pierre Bellanger]], founder and CEO of radio station [[Skyrock (radio)|Skyrock]] where Boutih worked as Manager of Institutional Relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.francetvinfo.fr/france/jihadistes-francais/ce-qui-derange-dans-le-rapport-du-depute-malek-boutih-sur-le-jihadisme_987939.html|title=Ce qui dérange dans le rapport du député Malek Boutih sur le jihadisme|date=2015-07-07|work=Franceinfo|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Libération]] the report "caricatures young people as thirsty for recognition, radicalised and inured to violence" and the daily laughs at certain suggestions such as creating "night clubs run by associations and publicly financed" to avoid people being turned away.&lt;ref name="LibéTableauNoir"/&gt;

=== Socialist Primary and 2017 Legislative election ===

In between the two rounds of the Socialist Party Primary to select a Presidential candidate, Malek Boutih vehemently attacked [[Benoît Hamon]] maintaining that he would be "in harmony with an [[Islamo-Leftism|Islamo-Leftist]] fringe [to whom] he would make a discreet electoral appeal" and branded him the candidate for ''Indigènes de la République'' (an anti-racist, anti-colonial, anti-Zionist party accused of racism, anti-semitism, homophobia and antifeminism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lelab.europe1.fr/islamisme-manuel-valls-justifie-les-attaques-de-malek-boutih-contre-benoit-hamon-2960330|title=Islamisme : Manuel Valls justifie les attaques de Malek Boutih contre Benoît Hamon - Le Lab Europe 1|first=Jérémie|last=Lamothe|work=[[Europe 1|europe1.fr]]|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remarks divided the supporters of Manuel Valls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/election-presidentielle-2017/article/2017/01/25/la-strategie-anti-hamon-divise-le-camp-valls_5068854_4854003.html|title=La stratégie anti-Hamon divise le camp Valls|last=Bonnefous|first=Bastien|date=2017-01-25|work=[[Le Monde]].fr|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March, he announced on [[Europe 1]] that he would support the candidate for [[En Marche!]], [[Emmanuel Macron]], from the first round of the presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.fr/2017/03/30/malek-boutih-annonce-son-soutien-a-emmanuel-macron_a_22018141/|title=Malek Boutih annonce qu'il votera Emmanuel Macron|date=2017-03-30|work=Le Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the 2017 Legislative elections, he sought nomination as a candidate for ''La République en marche !''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/elections-legislatives-2017/article/2017/05/09/legislatives-le-depute-ps-malek-boutih-sollicite-l-investiture-d-en-marche_5125117_5076653.html|title=Législatives : le député PS Malek Boutih sollicite l'investiture d'En marche !|date=2017-05-09|work=Le Monde.fr|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr|issn=1950-6244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nomination was refused and he competed in the election as an independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lci.fr/elections/boutih-touraine-valls-el-khomri-ils-ne-sont-pas-investis-par-la-republique-en-marche-pourtant-ils-se-revendiquent-de-la-majorite-presidentielle-2052905.html|title=Boutih, Touraine, El Khomri : ils ne sont pas investis par La République en marche, pourtant ils se revendiquent de la majorité présidentielle|work=LCI|access-date=2017-11-03|language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was eliminated in the first round with 12.39% of the vote.

'''Margaret Dorothy Foster''' (March 4, 1895 – November 5, 1970) was an American chemist. She was the first female chemist to work for the [[United States Geological Survey]], and was recruited to work on the [[Manhattan Project]].

==Life==
She was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her father was James Edward Foster and mother was Minnie (McAuley) Foster.
She graduated from [[Illinois College]], [[George Washington University]] and from [[American University]], with a Ph.D.&lt;ref name="am" /&gt;

Beginning in 1918, she became the first female chemist to work on the [[United States Geological Survey]], developing ways to detect minerals within naturally occurring [[body of water|bodies of water]].&lt;ref name=DayInSun&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Temple University Press|date=2003|title=Their Day in the Sun: Women of the Manhattan Project|author= Ruth H.

The [[Servant of God]] '''Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado''', [[Dominican Order|O.P.]] ({{lang-es|Sor María de Jesús}}), was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[lay brother|lay sister]], [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] and [[visionary]], known popularly as "La Siervita" (the Little Servant). She lived a life which was austere and simple, and many miracles were attributed to her, as well as [[levitation]], [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]], [[bilocation]], the [[stigmata]], [[clairvoyance]] and healing, among others.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios"&gt;[http://miguelbravo.com/LAGUNAPATRIMONIO/MONJASCATALINAS/SIERVITA/siervitasnotasprensa.pdf Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios]{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De León died with a reputation for [[sanctity]] and is one of the most revered of the natives of the [[Canary Islands]], together with [[Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur]] and [[José de Anchieta]]. The cause for her [[canonization]] has been submitted to the [[Holy See]] for review.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

== Early life ==
De León was born on March 23, 1643, in the town of [[El Sauzal]], located on the island of [[Tenerife]], one of the Spanish [[Canary Islands]], to Andrés de León y Bello and María Delgado y Perera, a humble family of noble origin, although in decline. She was of possible [[Guanches|Guanche]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revistacodice.es/publi_virtuales/v_congreso_mujeres/comunicaciones/analisis_iconografico_retrato_la_siervita.pdf Análisis iconográfico del retrato de sor María de Jesús "La Siervita de Dios"]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was their youngest child, having two sisters and a brother. According to the chronicles of the time, she was a woman of delicate features and a sweet face.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

From an early age, De León showed [[mysticism|mystical]] inclinations, especially in her feelings and great devotion to a miraculous image of the baby Jesus that was in the Church of St. Peter in her hometown. This image supposedly would open the doors of the church for her when she went to pray before it. There was also a laurel tree which would grow only under her care.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

With the death of De León's father in 1646, poverty overtook the family. Around this time, a couple from mainland Spain, who had relocated to the city of [[San Cristóbal de La Laguna]], where the husband was to practice medicine, had decided that they wanted another child to care for, along with their own child. Her mother, María Delgado, was convinced to give up her daughter by the doctor's wife with the promise of a better life for the child. Two years later, the couple made plans to move to [[New Spain]], with the intention of taking Mary with them. Before this could happen, she was recovered by her birth mother, who had learned of this plan. Delgado, however, died shortly after this, and her daughter was taken in by a good friend of her mother who lived in [[La Orotava]].&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

When De León was reaching her teenage years, two local woman, who had the reputation of leading simple lives, came to her foster mother, with a letter supposedly from the girl's maternal aunt, Catalina Delgado, which said that she and her husband wished to care for the care, and the bearers should accompany her to their farm. They then took her back to the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, where one of them approached a man in a back alley of the city. De León quickly realized that she was in danger and made her escape. She went to her aunt's home, where she was received and cared for by her and her uncle.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

Living there, De León gradually took over the care of the farm, doing the hardest jobs and organizing its operations. She would rise at dawn and spend the entire day at work, never showing signs of fatigue. Her spiritual qualities soon became apparent, as she treasured solitude and embraced the lowliest work. She led a life of strict penance, wearing the simplest clothing and sleeping on the floor. Over time, the farm flourished and her uncle, Miguel Pérez, felt that she should be the one to inherit their land. He drew up a will for this on 23 March 1665. Mary was torn. She felt a desire to live a religious form of life, one in which she could do the most needed work, living in total poverty, without even the [[dowry]] her inheritance would have provided. Finally she declared her intention to enter a monastery as a [[lay brother|lay sister]], a decision which her aunt and uncle accepted.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

Initially De León's guardians wanted her to enter the local monastery of the [[Poor Clares]] as the servant of their daughter, a [[choir nun]] in that community. She chose, however, to enter the monastery of the nuns of the [[Second Order (religious)|Dominican Second Order]],&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt; although she originally wanted to belong to the Order of [[Discalced Carmelites]], as she was very devoted to their foundress, St. [[Teresa of Ávila|Teresa of Jesus]]. As there had not yet been established any monasteries of the Discalced Carmelite nuns in the Canary Islands, De León entered the Dominican Order, due to a mysterious dream she had.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mdc.ulpgc.es/cdm/singleitem/collection/MDC/id/44036 Cuadros históricos de la admirable vida y virtudes de La Sierva de Dios: Sor María de Jesús de León Delgado]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LagunaCatalina01.jpg|thumb|250px|Monastery of St. [[Catherine of Siena]], where Sister Mary of Jesus' remains lie]]

==Entrance to the monastery==
In February 1668, De León was admitted to the Dominican Monastery of St. [[Catherine of Siena]] in San Cristóbal de La Laguna, located next to the Plaza del Adelantado in the center of the city, as a lay sister. There she was to care for an elderly nun of the community, Sister Jacobina de San Jerónimo Suárez, O.P. From that point on she would live within the monastery walls until her death, having never left the cloister. It was during this time that many miracles were attributed to her. One particular episode was one in which a [[devotional medal]] with the image of [[Our Lady of Solitude]] which she owned was reassembled spontaneously after having been broken into pieces several days before. Another possible episode of levitation was described by other nuns. As with other mystics, De León experienced [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]], during which the emission of light could be seen coming from her face. There were also reports of a marked heat emanating from her body, especially when receiving the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

De León had a great friendship with the famous pirate [[Amaro Rodríguez Felipe]], popularly known as the corsair "Amaro Pargo", whose sister was also a lay sister in the monastery and who shared a cell with De León. The privateer claimed to have experienced a great miracle through De León. Pargo recounted that he was assaulted by an individual when he was in [[Cuba]]. At the very instant when the attacker would have plunged his dagger into the body of the pirate, the figure of De León appeared, interceding and preventing Pargo's death. This phenomenon, known as ubiquity or [[bilocation]], and associated with many saints, is the capacity to be in two places simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

De León also had a great friendship with the Franciscan friar and mystic [[John of Jesus Hernández y Delgado|Fray Juan de Jesús]], who was her [[spiritual director]] and who gave her much counsel in pursuing the spiritual life.

De León died in monastery cloister on 15 February 1731, having lived within its walls for 63 years without leaving. Before her death, she fell into an ecstasy and died keeping a pulse and the pupils of her eyes clear for more than 24 hours. In her side, next to her heart, was found a wound, such as the one which would have been left by the side of Christ. Three years later her body was exhumed and was found incorrupt, whole and flexible. Her palate and tongue were preserved fresh and rosy, and [[jasmine]]-scented blood issued from her mouth.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

==Veneration ==
[[File:Cuerpo Incorrupto de La Siervita de Dios.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Incorruptibility|Incorrupt body]] of religious, Monastery of St. Catherine of Siena.]] 
De León's [[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]] body is still preserved in the Monastery of St. Catherine, where she lived out her life and died. Every 15 February (the anniversary of her death), her body is placed on public display in a glass-covered coffin, which was donated by the pirate Amaro Pargo, who was present at the exhumation. Because of the large numbers of pilgrims and devotees who desire to see her incorrupt body, the coffin is also displayed on the following Sunday.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

A formal inquiry into De León's life for possible canonization was begun in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, but soon ceased. The cause was reopened in 1992 and has been submitted to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. It remains pending. Supporters of her cause are dismayed by this lack of progress, despite a document from 1771 which lists 1,251 miracles attributed to her intercession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eldia.es/2011-02-15/LAGUNA/4-Sor-Maria-Jesus-aun-espera-milagro-beatifique.htm|work=El Día|date=15 February 2011|title=Sor María de Jesús aún espera por el milagro que la beatifique|last=Barbuzano|first=D.|accessdate=17 December 2012|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she has not yet been officially canonized, veneration of Sister Mary of Jesus has become the equivalent in the [[Canary Islands]] in cult of [[Teresa of Ávila|Saint Teresa of Jesus]] in the rest of [[Spain]], [[Saint Catherine of Siena]] in [[Italy]] and [[Rose of Lima|Saint Rose of Lima]] in [[Peru]] and [[Latin America]].{{cn|date=June 2018}}

== Miracles ==
Miracles associated with De León are:

*'''Levitation:''' The ability to maintain stable suspension in the air, and was described by several nuns of the monastery.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;
*'''Ecstasy:''' Is an experience of the divine, to feel the presence of God. La Siervita experienced this miracle several times, even as she lay dying.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;
*'''Bilocation:''' The ability to be in two places simultaneously. De León was credited with saving his life by the pirate Amaro Rodríguez through her sudden appearance during an assault on him while he was in [[Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;
*'''Hyperthermia:''' A remarkable elevation of body temperature and the emission of light from the head or face.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;
*'''Clairvoyance:''' The nun came to prophesy her own abduction, a great flood and an eruption of the [[Teide]] volcano, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eldia.es/2012-02-18/PRENSA/1-Candelaria-sor-Maria-Jesus-Siervita.htm La Candelaria de sor María de Jesús, la Siervita]{{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Stigmata:''' When she died, a wound as if by a [[lance]] was found by her heart.&lt;ref name="Notas sobre la Siervita de Dios" /&gt;

[[File:Maud Russell.jpg|thumb|Maud Russell]]
'''Maud Muriel Russell''' (August 9, 1893 – November 8, 1989) was an American social worker, educator, and writer. She is best remembered for her work as a social and political activist for the [[YWCA]] in China from 1917 to 1943. Returning to New York, she served as the executive director of the [[Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy]] from 1946 to 1951 and contributed to the journal ''[[Far East Reporter]]'' from 1953 until her death from lung cancer in 1989.

Russell was outspoken on the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the 1960s and 1970s and wrote many works and articles documenting it. In 1971, she was one of the inaugural members of the [[United States-China People's Friendship Association]].

==Early life and education==
Of British and Scottish descent, Russell was born in [[Hayward, California]]. Her parents were Thomas Russell and Lelia May (née Smalley); siblings included Jean, Thomas, Lloyd, Lelia, and David.{{sfn|Garner|2009|p=2}} Russell studied at [[University of California, Berkeley]], where she began her affiliation with the [[Young Women's Christian Association]], and here she met Mary Ingle Bentley (1878–1940), who became her life companion.&lt;ref name="nypl.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maud Russell papers 1914–1990 [bulk 1918–1989]|url=http://archives.nypl.org/mss/2649|publisher=New York Public Library|accessdate=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She studied for her master's degree at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1989"/&gt;

==Career==
Russell arrived in China in 1917.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1989"&gt;{{cite news|title=Maud Russell, 96; Aided Chinese|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/10/obituaries/maud-russell-96-aided-chinese.html|accessdate=March 6, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=November 10, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival, she studied the language in [[Nanjing]], and was subsequently appointed by the YWCA at a post in [[Changsha]] in Hunan. She worked in Changsha from 1919 to 1924, and later from 1928 to 1930, and again in 1932 to 1933.{{sfn|Sasaki-Gayle|2009|p=261}} When Changsha was invaded by the revolutionary army of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in 1930, Russell refused to leave the city and was mistakenly thought to have perished; a memorial service was held for her.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1989"/&gt;

During the 1930s, a turbulent and dangerous time to work in China during civil war and war with Japan,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1989"/&gt; she worked mainly at the headquarters of the YWCA in Shanghai. She participated in a [[Marx]]ist study group which included the likes of [[Rewi Alley]], [[Lily Haass]], [[Talitha Gerlach]] and [[Cora Deng]].{{sfn|Sasaki-Gayle|2009|p=261}}

Russell departed China in 1943, and began working for the YWCA in [[Passaic, New Jersey]] the following year.{{sfn|Sasaki-Gayle|2009|p=261}} She was appointed executive director of the Committee for a Democratic Far Eastern Policy in 1946, which she held for 6 years. In 1953, Russell began lecturing on contemporary China and began working on a self-published journal, ''Far East Reporter'',{{sfn|Garner|2009|p=208}} which she contributed to until her death in 1989.{{sfn|Wu|2015|p=320}} The ''Far East Reporter'' was described as a "magazine devoted to friendship and better understanding between the people of the U.S. and China".&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeingjohnsinclair.aadl.org/files/aa_sun_19740628_p008-003.jpg|title=Maud Russell at U:China's Cultural Revolution|publisher=''The Ann Arbor Sun ''|date=June 28, 1974|accessdate=March 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s, she was accused of being a member of the [[Communist Party]] and was called to appear before the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes that she "invoked her Fifth Amendment privilege against involuntary self-incrimination when asked if she was a member".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com1989"/&gt; Russell was outspoken on the [[Cultural Revolution]] in the 1960s and 1970s and wrote many works and articles documenting it. She pointed out that the "Chinese view the Cultural Revolution as a protracted struggle requiring many campaigns and revolutions in the cultural sphere, but that they are confident of victory and place their hope in China's young people, the tens of millions who will carry on the struggle".&lt;ref name="CR"/&gt; In New York in the summer of 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S.-China Review|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJe6AAAAIAAJ|year=1990|publisher=US-China Peoples Friendship Association|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was one of the inaugural members of the [[US–China Peoples Friendship Association]] (USCPFA), and revisited the country in 1972.{{sfn|Wu|2015|p=320}}

She was diagnosed with lung cancer in early summer 1989 and died at her home in New York on November 8, 1989 at the age of 96.{{sfn|Wu|2015|p=320}}&lt;ref name="CN"/&gt; After her death, she was described as a "truly remarkable person",&lt;ref name="CN"&gt;{{cite book|title=China Notes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iKWK4w3eI20C|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; who "led an extraordinary life of social and political activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Journal of American-East Asian Relations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hne5AAAAIAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Imprint Publications|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General]] '''Michel Micombero''' (August 26, 1940 – July 16, 1983) was a [[Burundi]]an politician and soldier who ruled the country as its first [[List of Presidents of Burundi|president]] and ''de facto'' [[dictator]] for the decade between 1966 and 1976. He was a member of the [[Tutsi|Tutsi ethnic group]].

Beginning his career as an officer in the [[Military of Burundi|Burundian army]], Micombero studied in [[Belgium]] and rose to prominence for his role in helping to foil an attempted [[1965 Burundian coup d'état attempt|coup d'état in October 1965]] where [[Hutu|ethnic Hutu]] soldiers attempted to overthrow the [[Kingdom of Burundi|country's (Tutsi) monarchy]]. After becoming prime minister in July 1966, Micombero led two further coup d'états against the monarchy, which he perceived as too moderate, and installed himself as president in November 1966. 

As President, Micombero ruled Burundi as a [[military dictator]]. He led a [[one-party state]] which centralised the country's institutions and adopted a neutral stance in the [[Cold War]]. Dissent was repressed and, in 1972, an attempt to challenge Micombero's power led to [[Burundian genocides|a genocide]] against the Hutu population in which around 100,000 people, mainly Hutus, were killed. His regime finally collapsed in 1976 when he was ousted in [[1976 Burundian coup d'état|a coup d'état]] by [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]]. Micombero went into exile in [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]] where he died in 1983.

==Biography==
===Origins and early political career===
Micombero was born in [[Rutovu]], [[Bururi Province]] in [[Ruanda-Urundi|Belgian-ruled Ruanda-Urundi]] on 26 August 1940. His parents were peasants from the [[Hema people]], part of the [[Tutsi]] ethnic group.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} Micombero studied at [[Catholicism|Catholic]] mission schools in [[Burundi]] and, in 1960, joined the [[Military of Burundi|Burundian military]] which was being formed ahead of planned independence in 1962.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} As part of his training, he was sent to study at the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]] in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]] to train as an officer.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} At the time of the independence of the [[Kingdom of Burundi]] in July 1962, he held the rank of [[captain]].{{sfn|African Biography|2008}}

In early post-independence Burundi, the Tutsi-dominated monarchy of [[Mwambutsa IV]] attempted to balance the interests of Tutsi with those of the Hutu majority. In 1963, Micombero joined the ruling [[Union for National Progress]] (UPRONA) party which, though dominated by Tutsi, also tried to attract Hutu members.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} In June, Micombero was named [[State Secretary for Defense]], making him head of the military at the age of 23.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} In October 1965, a group of ethnic Hutus [[1965 Burundian coup d'état attempt|attempted to overthrow the Burundian monarchy]]. Their attempt, though unsuccessful, led to Mwambutsa IV fleeing into exile. Micombero led the repression against the coup's perpetrators.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} In July 1966, a [[July 1966 Burundian coup d'état|second coup d'état]] brought the king's son, [[Ntare V]], to power and suspended the national constitution. However, when Ntare was on a [[state visit]] to the [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|neighbouring Republic of the Congo]] in November 1966, a [[November 1966 Burundian coup d'état|third coup d'état]] abolished the monarchy and a [[republic]] was proclaimed on 28 November.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} As a [[colonel]], Micombero took power as the country's first [[President of Burundi|President]] in December 1966.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}}

===Dictatorship===
[[File:Burundi in its region.svg|thumb|Location of [[Burundi]] in [[Central Africa]] ]]
As President of Burundi, Micombero ruled through UPRONA as a [[one-party state]]. His ideology of "democratic centralism" brought all the country's institutions and media under the regime's control.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} His regime combined ideas from [[Ujamaa|the socialist ideology]] of [[Tanzania]] with other doctrines from [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Joseph-Désiré Mobutu]]'s regime in the Congo.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} As a [[Cold War]] leader, he was able to play off both Communist and Western powers against one another.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}}

Micombero became increasingly paranoid after suffering an injury in a road accident in 1967.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} He was widely believed to be an [[alcoholic]]. Various plots against the regime were discovered and unrest remained.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} His base of support became increasingly restricted to Tutsi in the northern and central regions of Burundi.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}}

In April 1972, a major rebellion broke out among the Hutu in the south at the encouragement of the Tanzanian regime.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} In subsequent ethnic violence, as many as 1,000 Tutsi were killed. The reaction of the Micombero regime was to launch [[Burundian genocides|a genocidal campaign]] against the Hutu in the region in which around 100,000 people are thought to have been killed. The deposed king Ntare, said to have led the rebellion, was murdered.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} In 1973, after further violence, the Congolese Mobutu regime had to intervene to prevent Tanzanian invasion.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} Following the end of the crisis, Micombero introduced a new [[constitution]] allowing him to run for a further seven-year term. He also laid the foundation for the [[Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries]] the same year, along with the governments of [[Rwanda]] and Congo.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} 

In November 1976, opponents of Micombero's regime, led by Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Bagaza]], led a [[1976 Burundian coup d'état|successful coup d'état]]. Micombero himself was arrested and a second republic was declared under the dictatorship of Bagaza which would last until 1987.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}}

===Exile and death===
Micombero was exiled from Burundi in 1977.{{sfn|African Biography|2008}} He took up residence in [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]], then ruled by dictator [[Siad Barre]] who was a close friend. He gained a degree in economics from the [[University of Somalia]] in 1982.{{sfn|The New York Times|1983}} He died of a heart attack in 1983.{{sfn|The New York Times|1983}}

'''Francis T. "Mickey" Featherstone''' (born September 2, 1948) is a former [[Irish Mob|Irish American mobster]] and member of [[the Westies]], an [[organized crime]] syndicate from [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]], [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]], led by [[James Coonan]]. Featherstone committed several mob killings before he was convicted in 1986 of a murder he had not committed. Facing almost 25 years in jail, he became an informant and brought down Coonan's gang.

==Early life==
Featherstone was born on West 43rd St.,&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; one of nine children.&lt;ref name=ghosts&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oucCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|title=The Ghosts of Hell's Kitchen|last=Daly|first=Michael|author2=John Hamill|date=12 April 1982|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother helped with the [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] and his father was a [[United States Customs Service]] officer.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He had blond hair and was often said to be baby-faced.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He served in the [[Vietnam War]] as member of the [[Green Berets]] aged just 17 after lying about his age.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He served as a stock clerk.&lt;ref name=vicious&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/16/books/books-of-the-times-the-rise-and-fall-of-a-thoroughly-vicious-gang.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm|title=Books of The Times; The Rise and Fall of a Thoroughly Vicious Gang|last=Raab|first=Selwyn|date=16 April 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To his disappointment, he did not see combat, although he was circumcised by his friends in a drunken prank.&lt;ref name=vicious/&gt;&lt;ref name=stories&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/08/books/new-york-stories-hell-s-kitchen-killers.html|title=New York Stories: Hell's Kitchen Killers|last=Bain|first=David Haward|date=8 April 1990|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[military discharge|medical discharge]] in 1967 after just a year, claiming to have hallucinations.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

==Return to Hell's Kitchen==
When a group from New Jersey entered Hell's Kitchen called the Riley brothers a fight started with the outsiders, Featherstone returned with a rifle and shot one of the brothers John Riley in the arm, for which he was arrested and probationed.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He shot dead Linwood Willis in a confrontation outside a bar in 1971, but was found not guilty due to insanity.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; He spent time in a series of [[mental hospitals]], being released in 1975. He would act out frequently while in the hospitals, leading to him being restrained and injected with [[thorazine]].&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He began spending time in saloons like Club 596 and Sunbrite that were hangouts for the Westies.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

==The Westies==
Featherstone's penchant for violence and intimidation caught the eye of Coonan and Featherstone became Coonan's right-hand man by 1976.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; [[Mickey Spillane (mobster)|Mickey Spillane]], the mob leader in Hell's Kitchen at the time, was shot five times outside his apartment in August 1977, and Featherstone was arrested but acquitted for his killing.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; The police suspected him of a series of mob [[contract killing]]s. He went on trial with Coonan for the killing of a barman, but they were acquitted in December 1979 after one witness killed himself and another refused to testify.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt; He was finally jailed after using fake currency at a massage parlor - he was traced because the girl remembered seeing his name tattooed on his forearm. Featherstone did time in the Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield Missouri on the psychiatric ward in 1982. He was a model prisoner, seen daily picking fine lint off of his perfectly made bunk to pass inspection, and starting arguments with others for not polishing their door frame brass. The institution kept Featherstone working on the ward, out of General Population, for his own safety. In February 1982, he was sentenced to six years in jail for counterfeiting.&lt;ref name=ghosts/&gt;

Featherstone and Coonan had a falling out over the latter's alliance with the [[Gambino crime family]], which Featherstone saw as a betrayal of all the Irish-Americans in Hell's Kitchen.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt;

===Turning informer===
Featherstone was convicted in March 1986 for the April 1985 murder of Michael Holly, despite being innocent of this particular murder, which was a revenge attack probably carried out by another of the Westies, [[Billy Bokun]].&lt;ref name=lords&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/05/magazine/the-lord-s-of-hell-s-kitchen.html?src=pm|title=The Lords of Hell's Kitchen|last=Traub|first=James|date=5 April 1987|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was shocked at receiving his sentence of 25 years in prison, and concluded that he had been framed by his own gang.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; Rather than serving his sentence he instead told prosecutors that Bokun had committed the murder, and he became an [[informant]].&lt;ref name=lords/&gt;&lt;ref name=informed&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/01/nyregion/admitted-westies-killer-who-informed-is-free.html|title=Admitted Westies Killer Who Informed Is Free|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|date=1 January 1989|work=New York Times|accessdate=11 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Sissy co-operated with the District Attorney's office to tape incriminating conversations with gang members, including Bokun.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; In September 1986, Judge [[Alvin Schlesinger]] overturned Featherstone's conviction.&lt;ref name=lords/&gt; His testimony at Coonan's racketeering trial during 1987-8 helped to bring down Coonan's gang.&lt;ref name=stories/&gt; He pleaded guilty to a [[racketeering]] charge and received a suspended sentence of five years probation from Judge [[Robert W. Sweet]] due to his cooperation with the authorities.&lt;ref name=informed/&gt; He was freed in December 1988&lt;ref name=informed/&gt; and went into a [[witness protection]] program.&lt;ref name=informed/&gt;

The '''military career of Benedict Arnold in 1781''' consisted of service in the [[British Army]].  [[Benedict Arnold|Arnold]] had changed sides in September 1780, after his plot was exposed to surrender the key [[Continental Army]] outpost at [[West Point]].  He spent the rest of 1780 recruiting [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s for a new regiment called the [[American Legion (Loyalist)|American Legion]]. Arnold was then sent to [[Virginia]] with 1,600 men in late December by General [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Sir Henry Clinton]], with instructions to raid [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] and then establish a strong fortification at [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]].

He landed in Virginia on January 4, 1781 and raided Richmond the next day. They raided a few nearby communities, then returned to Portsmouth, where the troops established fortifications.  They remained there until late March, when 2,000 reinforcements arrived, led by General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]].  Phillips took command of the forces and Arnold served under him, as they resumed raiding operations aimed at potentially establishing a permanent presence at Richmond.  They fought off a spirited militia defense in the [[Battle of Blandford]] in late April, and the timely arrival of Continental forces under the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] prevented the taking of Richmond.  Phillips continued to raid, but was ordered to [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]] to effect a junction with General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], who was marching up from [[North Carolina]].  Phillips died on May 13 of a fever, and Arnold was briefly in command again until Cornwallis arrived a week later.  Arnold returned to New York, suffering from a recurrence of [[gout]].

French and American movements to encircle Cornwallis at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] became apparent to General Clinton, so he sent Arnold on a raiding expedition in early September to [[New London, Connecticut]] in an attempt to draw American resources away from Virginia.  Arnold raided the port, but a detachment of his troops was involved in the bloody [[Battle of Groton Heights]] at a fort across the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]].  The operation was the last command that Arnold held.  General Cornwallis had been released on parole after his [[Siege of Yorktown|surrender at Yorktown]], and he and Arnold sailed for England in December.

During his command of British troops, Arnold did not gain a great deal of respect from other officers.  His actions in Virginia and Connecticut were criticized, and allegations circulated in New York that he was primarily interested in money.  On his arrival in England, he was also unable to acquire new commands, either in the army or with the [[British East India Company]].  He resumed his business and trade activities, and died in London in 1801.

==Background==
[[Benedict Arnold]] was born in 1741 into a well-to-do family in the port city of [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] in the [[Connecticut Colony|colony of Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="Brandt4_6"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt;  He was interested in military affairs from an early age, serving briefly (without seeing action) in the colonial militia during the [[French and Indian War]] in 1757.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flexner|Flexner (1953)]], p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;  He embarked on a career as a businessman, first opening a shop in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and then engaging in overseas trade.  He owned and operated ships, sailing to the [[West Indies]], [[New France]], and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Flexner|Flexner (1953)]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  When the British Parliament began to impose taxes on its colonies, Arnold's businesses began to be affected by them and the resulting opposition, which he eventually joined.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 49–53&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1767, he married a local woman with whom he had three children, one of whom died in infancy.&lt;ref name="Brandt14"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="R62"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;  She died in 1775, and Arnold left his children under the care of his sister Hannah at his home in New Haven.&lt;ref name="Randall78_132"/&gt;

==Continental Army service, 1775–1780==
{{main|Military career of Benedict Arnold, 1775–1776|Military career of Benedict Arnold, 1777–1779}}
[[File:Valcour canadianarchive c013202k.jpg|thumb|right|Contemporary watercolor depicting Arnold's fleet in Valcour Bay]]
Arnold had distinguished himself early in the war, participating in the [[capture of Fort Ticonderoga]] in May 1775 and then boldly leading a raid on [[Fort Saint-Jean (Quebec)|Fort Saint-Jean]] near [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="Randall78_132"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 78–132&lt;/ref&gt;   He then led a small army from [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] to [[Quebec City]] on [[Arnold's expedition to Quebec|an expedition]] through the wilderness of present-day [[Maine]], where he was wounded in the climactic [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|Battle of Quebec]] on December 31, 1775.  After leading an ineffectual siege of Quebec until April 1776, he took over the military command of Montreal.&lt;ref name="Randall131_228"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 131–228&lt;/ref&gt;  He directed the American retreat from there on the arrival of British reinforcements, and his forces formed the rear guard of the retreating [[Continental Army]] as it headed south toward Ticonderoga.  Arnold then organized the defense of [[Lake Champlain]], and led the [[Continental Navy]] fleet that was defeated in the October 1776 [[Battle of Valcour Island]].&lt;ref name="Randall228_320"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 228–320&lt;/ref&gt;

During these actions, Arnold made a number of friends and a larger number of enemies within the army power structure and in Congress.  He established a decent relationship with [[George Washington]], commander of the army, as well as with [[Philip Schuyler]] and [[Horatio Gates]], both of whom had command of the army's Northern Department at different times during 1775 and 1776.&lt;ref name="Randall318_23"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 318–323&lt;/ref&gt;  However, an acrimonious dispute arose with [[Moses Hazen]], commander of the [[2nd Canadian Regiment]], which boiled into a court martial of Hazen at Ticonderoga during the summer of 1776. Only action by Gates, his superior at Ticonderoga, prevented his own arrest on countercharges leveled by Hazen.&lt;ref name="Randall262_4"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 262–264&lt;/ref&gt;  He also had disagreements with [[John Brown of Pittsfield|John Brown]] and [[James Easton (American Revolutionary War)|James Easton]], two lower-level officers with political connections.  His conflict with them resulted in ongoing suggestions of improprieties on his part.  Brown was particularly vicious, publishing a handbill that claimed of Arnold, "Money is this man's God, and to get enough of it he would sacrifice his country".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howe|Howe (1848)]], pp. 4–6{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arnold at Saratoga.jpg|thumb|left|Engraving depicting Arnold leading the attack on the redoubt at 2nd Saratoga]]
In December 1776, Washington sent Arnold to coordinate the defense of [[Rhode Island]] after the British occupied [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]]. No offensive action was possible, due to inadequate supplies and militia training.&lt;ref name="Randall321_25"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 321–325&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 1777, Arnold was passed over by Congress for promotion to major general—along with several other brigadiers.  While en route to Philadelphia to discuss the matter, he stopped in New Haven to visit his family, and fought in the rearguard [[Battle of Ridgefield]] against a British raiding party in which his left leg was injured once again.&lt;ref name="Randall331_6"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 331–336&lt;/ref&gt;  In Philadelphia, Arnold threatened to resign over the issue of rank, but demurred when it was learned that [[Siege of Fort Ticonderoga (1777)|Ticonderoga had fallen]].  He was sent north to assist in the defense of the Hudson River valley, and he helped lift the [[Siege of Fort Stanwix]] in August, and then played key roles in the two [[Battles of Saratoga]] in September and October.  He was stripped of his command after the first battle in a dispute with General Gates, who had come to see Arnold as a competitor for rank and glory. Midway through the second battle, he rode to the battlefield anyway and led the troops in a spirited attack on two British [[redoubt]]s, suffering serious injuries to his leg.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Martin|Martin (1997)]], pp. 333–405&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold recovered from his injuries, though he walked with a cane for the rest of his life, and Washington gave him the military command of Philadelphia after the British withdrew from the city in May 1778.  There his actions increased political opposition to him, and further inquiries were made into his affairs.&lt;ref name="Brandt146_70"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], pp. 146–170&lt;/ref&gt;  He also began consorting with Loyalist sympathizers, and married [[Peggy Shippen]], the daughter of one such man.&lt;ref name="Randall420_48"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 420–448&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after, he opened negotiations with British General Sir [[Henry Clinton (American War of Independence)|Henry Clinton]], mediated by British Major [[John André]], offering his services to their side.

He resigned his Philadelphia command in anger after poor treatment by Congress and local opponents. He then sought the command of [[West Point]], the key Continental Army base on the Hudson River, and acquired it in July 1780. He began to comply with plans to make it easier for the British to defeat West Point, systematically weakening its defenses.&lt;ref name="Randall452_582"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 452–582&lt;/ref&gt;  The plot was exposed in September 1780 when American forces captured Major André; Arnold fled to New York and was given a commission as a brigadier general in the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Arnold|Arnold (1905)]], pp. 342–348&lt;/ref&gt;  Major André was hanged as a spy, greatly upsetting the British.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 568&lt;/ref&gt;

The British gave Arnold a brigadier general's commission (one grade below his [[Continental Army]] rank) with an annual income of several hundred pounds, but they only paid him £6,315 ($350,000 in 2016) plus an annual pension of £360 ($19,000 in 2016) because his plot failed.&lt;ref name="DictCanBio"&gt;[[#Fahey|Fahey]]&lt;/ref&gt;  He and his wife settled in New York, where the Loyalist elites at first snubbed them, but they were eventually overcome by Peggy's charm.&lt;ref name=B249&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold began recruiting a new Loyalist regiment called the [[American Legion (Loyalist)|American Legion]], enrolling his young sons in the unit (at least on paper).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 577&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of it Loyalists and other defectors did not flock in larger numbers as Arnold and Clinton hoped.&lt;ref name="George Washington's War 1992"&gt;George Washington's War: The Saga of the American Revolution. Harper Collins. 1992. {{ISBN|0-06-016289-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton then assigned Arnold to lead an expedition to the [[Chesapeake Bay]].   As his force began to take shape in November and December, rumors swirled in the city that many officers were refusing to serve under him.&lt;ref name=B240&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the British soldiers in New York held Arnold responsible for the death of the popular Major André.&lt;ref name=B241&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore no British officer would serve under him.&lt;ref name="George Washington's War 1992"/&gt;

Arnold's preparations for the Chesapeake Bay expedition interrupted a scheme to kidnap him which was hatched by George Washington and [[Henry Lee III|Henry "Light Horse Harry" Lee]].  Pursuant to the plan, Lee's [[sergeant major]] [[John Champe (soldier)|John Champe]] staged a "desertion" from Lee's unit in New Jersey to British lines in New York late in October 1780, and convinced Arnold to take him on as a senior noncommissioned officer.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 578–579&lt;/ref&gt;  Champe was supposed to make contact with covert operatives working in New York, with whom he would work to kidnap Arnold.  After observing Arnold's habits, a plan was developed to be executed on the night of December 11.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 579&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold ordered his troops to embark on transports on December 11—including Champe—thus scuttling the attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 582&lt;/ref&gt;  Champe participated in the start of the expedition, and finally managed to escape several weeks later and return to Lee's unit.  Washington and Lee rewarded him richly, and convinced him to retire from military service so that he would not risk hanging for his role in the affair if he was captured.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rose|Rose (2006)]], p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Virginia===
[[File:William Phillips.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Arnold served under Brigadier General [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]] in Virginia.]]
Arnold's force of 1,600 troops arrived off [[Virginia]] on January 1, 1781, landing on January 4. They [[Raid of Richmond|captured Richmond]] by surprise and then went on a rampage through Virginia, destroying supply houses, foundries, and mills.&lt;ref name="R582_3"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 582–583&lt;/ref&gt;  This activity brought out Virginia's militia, led by Colonel [[Sampson Mathews]], initiating Arnold's return to [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]] to hold the port there.&lt;ref name=Waddell&gt;Wadell, Joseph (1902). Annals of Augusta County, Virginia, from 1726 to 1871. C. Russell Caldwell. p 278. Retrieved from https://books.google.com/books?id=rZbEC1kEdpcC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;lpg=PA278&amp;dq=%22sampson+mathews%22+benedict+arnold&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ogEYCfX4sU&amp;sig=fnh6UkBocVgPnZQdGyH-K_AIvR8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=AA6cUYyvL4jm9gSauIBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22sampson%20mathews%22%20benedict%20arnold&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The relative inactivity of holding the port led Arnold to request a change of command.  Reinforcements arrived in March, led by [[William Phillips (British Army officer)|William Phillips]] who had served under Burgoyne at Saratoga, and he took over the command.  However, Clinton did not issue orders recalling Arnold, so he accompanied Phillips on new raiding expeditions into the Virginia countryside.  The force advanced on [[Petersburg, Virginia|Petersburg]], where they defeated a militia force led by [[Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben|Baron von Steuben]] at the [[Battle of Blandford]] in late April.  The arrival at Richmond of the [[Marquis de Lafayette]] and 900 Continental troops sent by General Washington to oppose Arnold prompted Phillips to begin making his way back to Portsmouth.  While en route, they were ordered to return to Petersburg by [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Charles Cornwallis]], the commander of the British southern army, where he would join them with his force.  Phillips fell ill on the way and died of a fever at Petersburg on May 12.

Arnold commanded the army only until May 20, when Cornwallis arrived to take over.  One colonel wrote to Clinton of Arnold, "there are many officers who must wish some other general in command".&lt;ref name="R584_5"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 584–585&lt;/ref&gt;  Cornwallis disregarded advice proferred by Arnold to locate a permanent base away from the coast that might have averted his later [[Siege of Yorktown|surrender at Yorktown]].&lt;ref name="R584_5"/&gt;  Shortly after Cornwallis's arrival, Arnold suffered a severe attack of [[gout]] and returned to New York.&lt;ref name=B247&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sirhenryclinton2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry Clinton (1730–1795)|General Sir Henry Clinton]] treated Arnold poorly after Arnold criticized him.]]
During Arnold's time in Virginia, two things happened that had a negative impact on his reputation.  He wrote a letter to [[George Germain, 1st Viscount Sackville|Lord George Germain]], the British colonial secretary, criticizing Clinton's conduct of the war.  Word of this communication reached Clinton, and Arnold was met with a frosty reception on his return to New York, and with assignments to perform menial administrative tasks.&lt;ref name=B247_8&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold attempted to make amends, writing to Germain, "I find my letter has given umbrage; I am extremely sorry for it."&lt;ref name=B248&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

The second incident was a dispute with his naval counterpart on the Chesapeake, Captain [[Thomas Symonds]], over the distribution of [[prize (law)|prize]]s captured during the various expeditions.  Symonds was so incensed by Arnold's attitude that he refused to leave port to respond to reports of transports carrying Lafayette's troops on the bay.&lt;ref name=B246&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;  The incident became widely known when Arnold got back to New York, prompting one officer to write, "[Arnold] has hurt himself by discovering too much fondness for cash ... if he is attached to the latter ... he is no acquisition for us."&lt;ref name=B248/&gt;

Arnold's stint in Virginia also demonstrated that he was a target of Patriot wrath and revenge.  Virginia Governor [[Thomas Jefferson]] issued a large reward for his capture, and Washington gave orders to Lafayette to summarily [[Hanging|hang]] Arnold should he be captured.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;  Lafayette had shadowed Arnold and Phillips when they went to Petersburg to join with Cornwallis.  After Phillips died, Arnold tried to open communications with the marquis; the letters were returned unopened by Lafayette.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Unger|Unger (2002)]], p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington wrote to Lafayette, "Your conduct… meets my approbation… in refusing to correspond with Arnold."&lt;ref name=U141&gt;[[#Unger|Unger (2002)]], p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;  In conversation with one of Lafayette's officers sent to confer on prisoner exchanges, Arnold is said to have asked what would happen to him should he be captured.  The response was, "We should cut off the leg which was wounded in the country's service, and we should hang the rest of you."&lt;ref name=U141/&gt;  (The [[Boot Monument]] at the [[Saratoga National Historical Park]] honors his role there with a representation of his left boot, but it does not name him.)&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nelson|Nelson (2006)]], p. 400&lt;/ref&gt;

===New London===
On his return to New York in June, Arnold made a variety of proposals for continuing to attack economic or military targets (including West Point) in order to force the Americans to end the war.  Clinton was not interested in most of his aggressive ideas, but the arrival of 3,000 new Hessian troops led him to relent.&lt;ref name=B249/&gt;  He authorized an expedition against the port of [[New London, Connecticut]], near Arnold's childhood home of Norwich.  Arnold's force of more than 1,700 men [[Battle of Groton Heights|raided and burned New London]] on September 4, not long after the birth of his second son, and they captured [[Fort Griswold]], causing damage estimated at $500,000.&lt;ref name="R585_91"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 585–591&lt;/ref&gt;  British casualties were high; nearly one quarter of the force sent against Fort Griswold was killed or wounded, a rate at which Clinton claimed he could ill afford more such victories.&lt;ref name="R589"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], p. 589&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnold only reported 44 killed and 127 wounded in his official report, but there were unofficial whispers that between 400 and 500 casualties had occurred, with at least one claim that it had been like "a [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill expedition]]".&lt;ref name="Brandt252"/&gt;

The capture of Fort Griswold was followed by the British slaughtering the surviving garrison after the Americans had surrendered. Of a garrison numbering about 150, more than 130 were killed or seriously wounded.&lt;ref name=B250_2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ward|Ward (1952)]], p. 628&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen Hempstead was one of the American survivors; he stated, "After the massacre, they plundered us of everything we had, and left us literally naked."&lt;ref name="Allyn 53"&gt;Allyn, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Hempstead was among the wounded and reported that he was placed on a wagon with others to be taken down to the fleet.  The wagon was allowed to run down the hill, where it crashed into a tree, throwing some of the wounded men off the wagon and aggravating their injuries.&lt;ref name="Allyn 53"/&gt;
 
Arnold was not in a position to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions of his men.&lt;ref name=B250_2&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], pp. 250–252&lt;/ref&gt; American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.

==Later years==
{{quote box|alight=right|width=30%|quote=If [Arnold] really felt in his conscience that he had done wrong in siding against his mother country, he should have sheathed his sword and served no more [...] Gladly as I would have paid with my blood and my life for England's success in this war, this man remained so detestable to me that I had to use every effort not to let him perceive, or even feel, the indignation of my soul.|source=&amp;mdash; Hessian Captain [[Johann Ewald]] (translation by Joseph Tustin)&lt;ref name=E296&gt;[[#Ewald|Ewald (1979)]], p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Even before the surrender of Cornwallis in October, Arnold had requested permission from Clinton to go to England to give Lord Germain his thoughts on the war in person.&lt;ref name="Brandt252"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;  When word reached New York of the surrender, Arnold renewed the request, which Clinton then granted.  On December 8, 1781, Arnold and his family left New York for England.&lt;ref name="Brandt253"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 253&lt;/ref&gt;  In London, he aligned himself with the [[British Tory Party|Tories]], advising Germain and [[George III of Great Britain|King George III]] to renew the fight against the Americans. In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], [[Edmund Burke]] expressed the hope that the government would not put Arnold "at the head of a part of a British army" lest "the sentiments of true honor, which every British officer [holds] dearer than life, should be afflicted."&lt;ref name=Lomask&gt;[[#Lomask|Lomask (1967)]]&lt;/ref&gt;  To Arnold's detriment, the anti-war [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] had gotten the upper hand in Parliament, and Germain was forced to resign, with the government of [[Frederick North, Lord North|Lord North]] falling not long after.&lt;ref name="Brandt255"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold then applied to accompany General Carleton, who was going to New York to replace Clinton as commander-in-chief; this request went nowhere.&lt;ref name="Brandt255"/&gt;  Other attempts failed to gain positions within the government or the [[British East India Company]] over the next few years, and he was forced to subsist on the reduced pay of non-wartime service.&lt;ref name="Brandt257_9"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], pp. 257–259&lt;/ref&gt;  His reputation also came under criticism in the British press, especially when compared to that of Major André, who was celebrated for his patriotism.  One particularly harsh critic said that Arnold was a "mean mercenary, who, having adopted a cause for the sake of plunder, quits it when convicted of that charge."&lt;ref name="Brandt255"/&gt;  In turning him down for an East India Company posting, [[George Johnstone (Royal Navy officer)|George Johnstone]] wrote, "Although I am satisfied with the purity of your conduct, the generality do not think so.  While this is the case, no power in this country could suddenly place you in the situation you aim at under the East India Company."&lt;ref name="Brandt257"&gt;[[#Brandt|Brandt (1994)]], p. 257&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnold saw no further military duty, despite repeated attempts to gain command positions in the British Army or with the British East India Company.  He resumed business activities, engaging in trade while based in [[Saint John, New Brunswick]] and then [[London]].  He died in London in 1801, and was buried without military honors.&lt;ref name="Randall592_612"&gt;[[#Randall|Randall (1990)]], pp. 592–613&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mistawasis''' (Big Child) born as Pierre Belanger was also known as “Piwaspiskomostos” (Iron Buffalo), and “Mistahi Awas Asis, or Mistawasis” (Big Child).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/13514.Pierre%20Belanger%20Mistawasis2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Chief of the Sak-kaw-wen-o-wak Plains [[Cree]],&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saskatchewan First Nations: Lives Past and Present|last=Thompson|first=Christopher|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2004|isbn=0889771618|location=Regina|pages=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; notable for his role as the leader of his people during the signing of [[Treaty 6]] in 1876. He was born circa 1796 to a French father, Bernard Belanger (b.c. 1760), and a Nakoda mother,
Kakakewachin (b. 1765) near Slave Lake in what is now the province of [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=West|first=Ian|date=2014|title=Mistawasis -- Big Child c. 1880|url=|journal=Whispering Wind|volume=42|pages=21–23|via=EBSCOHOST}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the dwindling [[American bison|buffalo]] population caused by excessive hunting, he was forced to look for new strategies to ensure the survival of his people and their culture. The loss of the buffalo threatened his people and he believed that the only way to save his people would be to negotiate with the Canadian Government.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compact, Contract, Covenant: Aboriginal Treaty-making in Canada|last=Miller|first=James Rodger|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2009|isbn=0802097413|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held great influence over his people and it was due to this influence that he, and his close ally [[Ahtahkakoop]], were able to argue successfully for the adoption of [[Treaty 6]] by his fellow Cree. Mistawasis made history as the first signatory of Treaty 6.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After the treaty was signed he remained an ally of the Canadian government until his death.

== Early life ==
The exact date of Mistawasis’ birth is disputed. Estimations indicate that may have been born sometime between 1796 and 1813.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The location of his birth was in the area of Slave Lake, Saskatchewan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was born to a French father by the name of Bernard Belanger and a woman of [[Assiniboine]] descent.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His birth name was Pierre Belanger, though it was rarely used in his adulthood.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He had siblings, though the exact number is unknown, one of them went by the same name as their father, Bernard Belanger.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/pitikwahanapiwiyin_11E.html|title=PITIKWAHANAPIWIYIN (Poundmaker)|last=Dempsey|first=Hugh A.|date=|website=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mistawasis married Iskwesis Sitipinatowe and had at least two children. He then married married Ann Awasis Mashe Nah Sho Wishk (b. 1800) and had 5 children.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metismuseum.ca/media/document.php/13514.Pierre%20Belanger%20Mistawasis2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hudson’s Bay Company (HBC) would utilize his prowess as a provider, commonly trading for buffalo meat in exchange for other goods.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He also worked as a freighter for the HBC. He was known to some as Piwapiskomostos, a name meaning "Iron Buffalo". He received this name after a hunting accident where he was tossed from horseback onto one of the buffalo he was hunting. Despite this he sustained no injuries from the encounter, earning him the moniker of Piwapiskomostos.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The famous Cree Chief [[Pîhtokahanapiwiyin|Pitokwahanapiwiyin]] (Poundmaker) is his maternal nephew.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;



== Disappearance of the Buffalo ==
The American buffalo’s habitat once ranged in the general area from the American east coast, south-west to near Mexico, and northwards to Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Extermination of the American Bison|last=Hornaday|first=William Temple|publisher=Library of Alexandria|year=1887|isbn=1465543074|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the largest land mammals found on the continent of North America.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taylor|first=M.

This was due to their relative lightness as well as the ability to tan the furs at a quicker rate then the males.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The majority of hunts were carried out in the winter, due to the buffalo’s hair growing thicker in this time of the year.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Winter happened to coincide with the buffalo’s breeding season, meaning that many of the buffalo killed had a high possibility of being in some stage of pregnancy at the time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Being that buffalo only have one calf per year, the removal of large numbers of pregnant buffalo significantly weakened the animal’s ability to naturally replenish its population.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Significance of Buffalo to Cree ===
One of the most important features of the Cree’s way of life was the buffalo.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plains Cree: Trade, Diplomacy, and War, 1790 to 1870|last=Milloy|first=John S.|publisher=University of Manitoba Press|year=1990|isbn=0887553834|location=Winnipeg, Manitoba|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a resource which was used extensively by the Cree for many different purposes. Its meat was used as food for personal sustenance as well as for trade with the Hudson’s Bay Company.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Its skin was used in the construction of living quarters.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; It was also used by the various indigenous groups of the region to make clothing, amounting to roughly two buffalo skins per person per year to be dedicated to the production of new clothing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The animal’s bones were often used to create most of the tools used by the Cree people.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Buffalo were important for trade with the Hudson’s Bay Company as this trade was the only possible way for the Cree to acquire such useful goods as guns, as well as the ammunition needed to use the weapons.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The Cree would hunt buffalo often without horses, to over come the difficulties associated with this they would often herd the animals into corrals so they could then kill them in a more manageable way.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Buffalo Wars ===
The sudden decrease in buffalo further destabilized the region by causing the Cree to trespass into [[Blackfoot Confederacy|Blackfoot]] territory in search of buffaloes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This trespassing would often lead to skirmishes between the two groups which could often end in loss of life on both sides.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This fighting included numerous battles which resulted in the deaths of many Cree warriors.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Cree and Blackfoot would see peace in 1857, though it was short lived and war was restarted in 1860. The Cree would continue to use the war as a means to venture west, in search of the buffaloes which no longer existed in their homelands.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The war would then continue in a sporadic and destructive nature until a permanent peace was finally signed in 1871.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The war had caused extensive loss of life for the Cree and failed to result in the expansion of their territory to the buffalo rich areas of the west.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

[[File:Numbered-Treaties-Map.svg|thumb|277x277px|Area Covered by Treaty 6 (In Light Green)]]

== Treaty 6 ==
The sudden loss of an abundance of buffalo caused fear to spread throughout native communities in the 1870s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was from this fear, and a hope for the future, that Mistawasis began to think about what he wanted his people’s future to look like. It was from this perspective that Mistawasis and other leaders of the Cree communities began to believe that negotiation with the Canadian Crown Authorities would be their best course of action.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the items Mistawasis hoped to acquire for his people was access to education.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Shingwauk's Vision: A History of Native Residential Schools|last=Miller|first=J.R.|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1996|isbn=1442690739|location=Toronto, Ontario|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He perceived a European education as important to the future survival of his people and attempted to gain access to this through the Canadian government.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; He wanted to ensure that his people would be provided not only with school houses but also the teachers to operate and instruct in them.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It was due to this belief that his peoples' way of life was disappearing along with his hope of an improved future that caused him to attend the negotiations at Fort Carlton in late August 1876.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The British crown was represented by several men with British Treaty Commissioner [[Alexander Morris (politician)|Alexander Morris]] taking the leading role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aboriginal and Treaty Rights in Canada|last=Venne|first=Sharon|publisher=UBC Press|year=2011|isbn=0774842334|editor-last=Asch|editor-first=Michael|location=Vancouver, BC|pages=173–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistawasis argued for the treaty as a necessity for acquiring food by claiming that "Our way of living is gone, there are no more buffalo, we have to find a new way to feed our people."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During much of the treaty negotiation process, Mistawasis' points of view were shared by his friend and ally [[Ahtahkakoop]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ahtahkakoop, like Mistawasis, was also concerned about the decrease in available buffalo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ahtahkakoop was also quite interested in obtaining an education for his people, as well as help in gaining a better understanding of agriculture to fill the void in food left by the disappearance of the buffalo.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop were met with resistance by other Chiefs of the Cree nation. The Cree Chief Poundmaker disagreed with the ideas of Mistawasis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He was supported by other dissenting opinions of Chiefs Young Chipewyan, and The Badger.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Poundmaker’s main argument against the signing of the treaty was his belief that the Canadian government would only adhere to the Cree demands in exchange for hegemony over all of the Cree’s lands, a price he did not want to pay.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mistawasis countered the argument of the chiefs who shared Poundmaker’s outlook by challenging them to provide a better solution that what the Canadians were offering.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mistawasis further argued "…that the [[Queen Victoria|Great White Queen Mother]] has offered us a way of life when the buffalo are no more. Gone they will be before many snows have come to cover our heads or graves if such should be."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He further argued that the queen would "stop the senseless wars among our people, against the Blackfoot, Peigans, and Bloods."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; He also believed that by allying himself with the Queen that he could restrict the sale of alcohol to his people, a goal that he was personally passionate about.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On top of all this he argued that none of them could hope to survive in the face of the increasing flow of immigrants from the east on their own.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mistawasis ended his argument by declaring "I for one will take the hand that is offered."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ahtahkakoop shared the same sentiments as Mistawasis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After presenting his points to the other Chiefs, Mistawasis became the first of the men gathered to sign [[Treaty 6]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The other Cree Chiefs were swayed by the word of Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop and agreed to sign the treaty, which would from then on be known as Treaty 6.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-6/|title=Treaty 6|last=Filice|first=Michelle|date=11 Nov 2016|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treaty 6 would later be added onto by other members of the Cree nation at Fort Pitt in September 1876.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== The provisions of Treaty 6 ===
When the initial stage of Treaty 6 was complete it contained many provisions which were favorable to the Cree people. It contained all rights and protections previously awarded in Treaties One through Five.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; This meant that the Cree were entitled to: monetary compensation/assistance from the federal government, the establishment of reserve lands which were off limits to outsiders, they would be fully provided with farm equipment, and finally that their Chiefs would receive uniforms and medals befitting their positions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/treaty-5/|title=Treaty 5|last=Filice|first=Michelle|date=2016-08-24|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these basic tenets it also contained some additional decrees.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In response to the dwindling buffalo populations, the Cree were promised protection if they were to suffer from famine during their conversion to agriculture, in other words the Canadian Government agreed to send food relief in times of need.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The other major provision added to Treaty 6 was that each Indian agent would maintain a fully stocked medicine chest to be utilized by the Cree in the event of any disease outbreaks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Later life ==
After the signing of Treaty 6, Mistawasis maintained a close relationship to the crown authorities. He used his power to attempt to stop the flow of alcohol into his people’s territory, his work in doing so was one of the reasons the Canadian Government created the Northwest Mounted Police, to help in this venture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He is also responsible for the establishment of Mistawasis First Nation, which was named after him.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mistawasis.ca/about/history/|title=History|publisher=Mistawasis First Nation|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistawasis would later allow a Presbyterian Mission to be established on his reserve.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Honoré Jaxon: Prairie Visionary|last=Smith|first=Donald B.|publisher=Coteau Books|year=2007|isbn=1550503677|location=Regina, SK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mistawasis maintained a positive relationship with the Canadian Government during the 1885 Riel Rebellion, when he offered to defend the city of Prince Albert from any incursion by Riel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mistawasis was in attendance at the unveiling of the Joseph Brant Memorial in 1886.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During this visit to Ontario he met Prime Minister John A. MacDonald, and became enamored with the culture and technology of Canada.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Death ==
Like his birth date, the exact date of Mistawasis’ death is also not known, although his final resting place is in the cemetery of the Presbyterian church built on his reserve. Dates of 1886,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 1896,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; and 1903&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; have all been given as the true date. After his death he was succeeded as chief by George Dreaver, who remained Chief until he passed away in 1938.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; George was then succeeded by his son, and Mistawasis' grandson, Joe Dreaver who served as Chief of Mistawasis First Nation for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saskatchewan First Nations: Lives Past and Present|last=Crevier|first=Charlene|publisher=University of Regina Press|year=2004|isbn=9780889771611|editor-last=Thompson|editor-first=Christian|location=Regina, SK|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mohammad-Vali Gharani''' ({{lang-fa|محمدولی قرنی}}) was an [[Iran|Iranian]] military officer who served as the first Chief-of-Staff of the [[Iranian Army]] after the [[Iranian Revolution]], from 12 February 1979&lt;ref name="r"&gt;{{citation|author=Nikola B. Schahgaldian, Gina Barkhordarian|title=The Iranian Military Under the Islamic Republic|url=https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/reports/2007/R3473.pdf|publisher=RAND|isbn=0-8330-0777-7|date=March 1987|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 27 March 1979, when he was forced out.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt;

By August 1953, Gharani was commander of the Rasht Brigade and loyal to the Shah. He met with [[Ardeshir Zahedi]] and helped [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]]. Following the coup, he was promoted to vice Chief-of-Staff.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; In 1957, when [[SAVAK]] was established, he reportedly was a candidate to take office as head of the newly established secret service.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; Gharani however had become increasingly critical of regime due to 'endemic corruption' over the past years, unbeknownst to the authorities.&lt;ref name="EP"/&gt; He planned a coup d'état against the regime which was exposed, leading to [[dishonorable discharge]] in 1958. He was imprisoned twice in 1958 and 1963.&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

He was assassinated on 23 April 1979 by [[Forghan group]].&lt;ref name="r"/&gt;

==Accused activity==
Fadhil was accused of preparing TNT and loading that TNT plus other explosives into the truck which was used as a bomb in Tanzania. He was wanted on eleven counts of murder, several weapons and conspiracy charges, and charges which applied specifically to attacks against American government personnel and facilities.

Fadhil fled Nairobi to Karachi on 2 August 1998, on the same airliner as [[Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan]].

Fadhil was on the FBI's [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists|Most Wanted Terrorists]] list from its inception on 10 October 2001. He served as [[Abdul Hadi al-Iraqi]]'s second-in-command. A [[Guantanamo Bay files leak|leaked Guantanamo Bay file]] and an interrogation of al-Qaeda operative [[Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani]] revealed that Fadhil was eventually killed in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://media.mcclatchydc.com/smedia/2011/04/28/05/us9ym-000041dp.source.prod_affiliate.91.pdf See Page 8, Footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://americanjihadists.com/2008-12-Ghailani-Interrogation-all.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2005, Fadhil's name was removed from both the FBI's list and the US State Department's [[Rewards for Justice]] list.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050507062608/http://www.fbi.gov:80/mostwant/terrorists/fugitives.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050810074420/http://www.rewardsforjustice.net:80/english/wanted_captured/index.cfm?page=Wanted_Terrorist&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, [[al-Qaeda]] spokesperson [[Adam Gadahn]] confirmed the death of Fadhil, referring to him as a "martyr".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Rah_e_Hidayat/status/407745077147357184|title=Al Islah on Twitter|work=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prince (William Alexander Frederick) Ernest Casimir of the Netherlands, Prince of Orange-Nassau''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Willem Alexander Frederik Ernst Casimir, Prins der Nederlanden, Prins van Oranje-Nassau''; [[Soestdijk Palace]], 21 May 1822 – [[Brussels]], 22 October 1822) was the fourth son of the [[Prince of Orange]], later [[King William II of the Netherlands]] and his wife [[Anna Pavlovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna of Russia]].

He was baptised at 18 June 1822 in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Amsterdam)|Nieuwe Kerk]] in [[Amsterdam]]. Suffering from [[hydrocephalus]], he died the same year. He was buried in the Protestant Church in Brussels, until his body was transferred to the Royal Crypt in the [[Nieuwe Kerk (Delft)|Nieuwe Kerk]] ([[English language|English]]: New Church) in [[Delft]] in 1860.

'''Prophets in Islam''' ({{lang-ar|الأنبياء في الإسلام}}) include "messengers" (''rasul'', pl. ''rusul''), bringers of a [[Revelation|divine revelation]] via an angel (Arabic: {{lang|ar|ملائكة}}, [[Islamic view of angels|malāʾikah]]);&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shaatri, A. I. 2007"&gt;Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Prophet#Islam|prophet]]s" (''nabī'', pl. ''anbiyāʼ''), lawbringers that [[Muslim]]s believe were sent by [[God in Islam|God]] to every person, bringing God's message in a language they can understand.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo|first1=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816054541|pages=559–560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=prophethood+in+islam+encyclopedia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pTKIVduAEobuoAS0-Yi4Ag&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=prophethood%20in%20islam%20encyclopedia&amp;f=false|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|30|47|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge of the Islamic prophets is one of the [[Iman (concept)#The_Six_Articles_of_Faith|six articles of the Islamic faith]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|title=BBC - Religions - Islam: Basic articles of faith|last=|first=|date=|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813005904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/beliefs.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and specifically mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{quran-usc|2|285|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims believe that the first prophet was also the first human being, [[Adam]] ([[Adam in Islam|ادم]]), created by Allah (الله). Many of the revelations delivered by the 48 [[prophets in Judaism]] and many [[prophets of Christianity]] are mentioned as such in the Quran but usually in slightly different forms. For example, the Jewish [[Elisha]] is called [[Elisha#In Islam|Eliyas]], [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] is [[Job in Islam|Ayyub]], [[Jesus]] is [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]], etc. The [[Torah]] given to [[Moses]] ([[Moses in Islam|Musa]]) is called ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'', the [[Psalms]] given to [[David]] ([[David in Islam|Dawud]]) is the ''[[Zabur]]'', the [[The gospel|Gospel]] given to Jesus is ''[[Gospel in Islam|Injil]]''.&lt;ref name=campo-2009-559/&gt;

Unique to Islam is [[Muhammad]] ([[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad ibn ʿAbdullāh]]), who Muslims believe is the "Seal of the Prophets" (''[[Khatam an-Nabiyyin]]'', i.e. the last prophet); and the [[Quran]], revealed to Muhammad but not written down by him,&lt;ref name=denffer&gt;{{cite book|last=Denffer|first=Ahmad von|title=Ulum al-Qur'an : an introduction to the sciences of the Qur an|year=1985|publisher=Islamic Foundation|isbn=0860371328|pages=37|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Muslims believe is unique among divine revelations as the only correct one protected by [[God in Islam|God]] from distortion or corruption,&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding the Qurán'' - Page xii, Ahmad Hussein Sakr - 2000&lt;/ref&gt; destined to remain in its true form until the [[End time|Last Day]].&lt;ref name="The Qur'an Surah 15:9"&gt;{{Cite quran|15|9|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe Muhammad to be the last prophet, although after the prophets there are still [[Wali|saints]]&lt;ref&gt;Neal Robinson ''Christ in Islam and Christianity'' SUNY Press 1990 {{ISBN|978-0-791-40558-1}} page 58&lt;/ref&gt; (though some modern schools, such as [[Salafism]] and [[Wahhabism]], reject the theory of sainthood&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, B., Lory, P., Zarcone, Th., DeWeese, D., Gaborieau, M., F. M. Denny, Françoise Aubin, J. O. Hunwick and N. Mchugh, "Walī", in: ''Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition'', Edited by: P. Bearman, Th. Bianquis, C. E. Bosworth, E. van Donzel, W. P. Heinrichs.&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Muslim belief, every prophet in Islam preached the same main Islamic beliefs, the [[Tawhid|Oneness of God]], worshipping of that one God, avoidance of [[Shirk (Islam)|idolatry]] and [[Islamic views on sin|sin]], and the belief in the [[Islamic eschatology|Day of Resurrection]] or the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgement]] and life after death. Each came to preach Islam at different times in history and some told of the coming of the final ''Islamic prophet and messenger'' of [[God in Islam|God]], who would be named "[[Ahmad|Ahmed]] and Muhammad". 

This narrative is found in "Chapter of the Ranks", Qur'an, 61:6 as Allah asked Jesus to remind the Children of Israel but they accused him of the prophecy:

&lt;big&gt;وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ٱبْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَـٰبَنِى إِسْرَٰعِيلَ إِنِّى رَسُولُ ٱللهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَىَّ مِنَ ٱلتَّوْرىٰةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِى مِن بَعْدِى ٱسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ فَلَمَّا جَآءَهُم بِٱلْبَيِّنَـٰتِ قَالُواْ هَـٰذَا سِحْرٌ مُّبينٌ&lt;/big&gt;  

''wa-idh qāla ‘Īsā ’b·nu Maryama: "yā Banī Israā‘īla innī Rasūlu ’llāhi ilay-kum muṣaddiqal li-mā bayna yadayya mina ’t-Tawraāti wa-mubash·shiram bi-Rasūlin ya’tī mim ba‘dī ’s·mu-huū Aḥmadu, fa-lammā jaā’a-hum bi’l-bayyināti, qālū "hādhā siḥrum mubīn!"''

{{quote|&lt;nowiki&gt;And remember, Jesus, the son of Mary, said: "O Children of Israel! I am the messenger of Allah (sent) to you, confirming the Law [=Torah] (which came) before me, and giving Glad Tidings of a Messenger to come after me, whose name shall be Ahmad." But when he came to them with Clear Signs, they said, "this is evident sorcery!"&lt;/nowiki&gt;|Quran, sura 61 (As-Saf), ''[[ayah]]'' 6|source=}}

== Etymology ==
In Arabic and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]],&lt;ref&gt;The Hebrew root [[Nun (letter)|nun]]-[[Bet (letter)|vet]]-[[Aleph|alef]] ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-vet which denotes hollowness or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself "open". Cf. [[Rashbam]]'s comment to {{Bibleverse||Genesis|20:7|105}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''nabī'' (Arabic plural form: &lt;big&gt;أَنْبِيَاء&lt;/big&gt; ''anbiyāʼ'') means "prophet". Forms of this noun occur 75 times in the Quran. The term ''[[nubuwwah]]'' ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;نُبُوَّة&lt;/big&gt; meaning "prophethood") occurs five times in the Quran. The terms ''rasūl'' ([[Arabic]] plural: &lt;big&gt;رُسُل&lt;/big&gt; ''rusul'') and  ''mursal'' ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَل&lt;/big&gt; ''mursal''; plural: &lt;big&gt;مُرْسَلُون&lt;/big&gt; ''mursalūn'') denote "messenger with law given/ received by GOD" and occur more than 300 times. The term for a prophetic "message" ([[Arabic|ِArabic]] singular: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَة&lt;/big&gt; ''risālah''; plural: &lt;big&gt;رِسَالَات&lt;/big&gt; ''risālāt''), appears in the [[Quran]] in ten instances.&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Uri Rubin, "Prophets and Prophethood", ''[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syriac language|Syriac form]] of ''rasūl Allāh'' (literally: "messenger of God"), ''s̲h̲eliḥeh d-allāhā'', occurs frequently in the [[New Testament apocrypha|apocryphal]] ''[[Acts of Thomas|Acts of St. Thomas]]''. The corresponding verb for ''s̲h̲eliḥeh''—''s̲h̲alaḥ'', occurs in connection with the prophets in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:13-14|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|4:13|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:8|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Jeremiah|1:7|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;A. J. Wensinck, "Rasul", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "prophet" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|نبي}} {{transl|ar|''nabī''}}) and "messenger" (Arabic: {{lang|ar|رسول}} {{transl|ar|''rasūl''}}) appear several times in the [[Old Testament]] and the [[New Testament]].

In the Hebrew Bible, the word ''[[Nevi'im|nabi]]'' ("spokesperson, prophet") occurs more commonly, and the Hebrew word ''mal'akh'' ("messenger") refers to [[Angels in Judaism]]. According to Judaism, [[Haggai]], [[Zechariah (Hebrew prophet)|Zaqariah]], and [[Malachi]] were the last prophets, all of whom lived at the end of the 70-year [[Babylonian exile]]. With them, the authentic period of ''[[Prophecy#Judaism|Nevuah]]'' ("prophecy") died,&lt;ref&gt;According to the [[Vilna Gaon]], based on the opinion that [[Nechemyah]] died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE). Nechemya was governor of [[Yehud Medinata|Persian Judea]] under [[Artaxerxes I of Persia]] in the 5th century BCE. The [[Book of Nehemiah]] describes his work in rebuilding Jerusalem during the [[Second Temple period]]. {{Cite journal | title = Babylonian Talmud | first = Vilna |last=Gaon |authorlink=Vilna Gaon| volume = San.11a, Yom.9a/Yuch.1.14/Kuz.3.39,65,67/Yuch.1/Mag.Av.O.C.580.6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nowadays only the "[[Bath Kol]]" (בת קול, lit. ''daughter of a voice'', "voice of God") exists ([[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 11a).

In the New Testament, however, the word "messenger" becomes more frequent, sometimes in association with the concept of a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|3:1|1000}}; [[Gospel of John|John]] {{bibleverse-nb||John|17:3|1000}}; [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|11:10|1000}}; [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:2|1000}}; [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|3:5|1000}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|4:11|1000}}; [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Corinthians|28:12|1000}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Messenger" may refer to Jesus, to his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]] and to John the Baptist. But the last book of the Old Testament, the [[Book of Malachi]], speaks of a messenger that Christian commentators interpret as a reference to the future prophet [[John the Baptist]] (Yahya).&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Barnes (theologian)|Albert Barnes]] under {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:7|1000}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Malachi|3:1|1000}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2018}}
In Muslim belief, every Islamic prophet preached Islam. The beliefs of [[Charity (practice)|charity]], prayer, pilgrimage, worship of God and fasting are believed to have been taught by every prophet who has ever lived.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Quran itself calls Islam the "religion of [[Abraham]]" ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|67|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to [[Jacob]] ([[Jacob in Islam|Yaqub]]) and the [[Israelites|Twelve Tribes of Israel]] as being Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|123|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran says
{{quote|The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah—the which We have sent by inspiration to thee—and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:...|Quran, sura 42 ([[Ash-Shura]]), ayah 13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Status ===
Islam teaches that prophets were "protected from sin" by God, so unlike lesser human beings they cannot commit a sin.&lt;ref name="Auda-2016"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Auda |first1=Jasser |title=Were Prophets and Companions Infallible? |url=http://aboutislam.net/counseling/ask-about-islam/prophets-companions-infallible/ |website=About Islam |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=Nov 17, 2016 |quote=Regarding the issue of the prophets being sinless or infallible, there is an agreement among scholars that prophets are protected from sins. The protection of all prophets from sins is an Islamic belief, which is a precondition to trusting the prophets’ message and following their example.
However, there is a debate among scholars on whether prophets (peace be upon them all) are subject to error in judgments in “human” matters. The word `issmah (literally: protection) is mentioned in the Quran in the context of the Prophet being protected from people’s whims and Satan’s delusions while he conveys the message of God.
However, the Quran did correct Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) on a few occasions in matters of human judgment (Quran 8:67; 9:43; and 80:1-3).
Nevertheless, some scholars rejected the possibility of erring in any prophetic decision whatsoever (for example, Al-Amedi, Al-Ihkaam fi Usul Al-Ahkam, vol.4, p. 99, Dar Al-Kitab Al-Arabi, Beirut, AH 1404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IQA"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Saalih al-Munajjid |first1=Muhammad |title=248875: Infallibility of the Prophets |url=https://islamqa.info/en/248875 |website=Islam Question and Answer |accessdate=8 July 2018 |date=4 January 2017 |quote=The Prophets were infallible in conveying the message from Allah, may He be exalted, so their words could not be but true and they did not make any mistake, whether deliberate or otherwise, in conveying the message.  They were also infallible and protected from committing major sins such as zina (adultery) and theft.  They were also infallible and protected from committing minor sins that are indicative of baseness, such as stealing a morsel of food or giving short measure.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran speaks of the ''Islamic prophets'' as being the greatest human beings of all time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Prophets"&lt;/ref&gt; A prophet, in the Muslim sense of the term, is a person whom God specially chose to teach the faith of Islam.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some were called to prophesy late in life, in Muhammad's case at the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, ''Historical Dictionary of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', "Noah"&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as John the Baptist, were called to prophesy while still at a young age and Jesus prophesied while still in his cradle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|30|e=33|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Quran verse 4:69 lists various virtuous groups of human beings, among whom prophets (including messengers) occupy the highest rank. Verse 4:69 reads:&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

{{quote|All who obey [[Allah]] and the messenger are in the company of those on whom is the Grace of Allah—of the prophets (who teach), the sincere (lovers of Truth), the witnesses (who testify), and the Righteous (who do good): Ah! what a beautiful fellowship!|Quran, sura 4 (An-Nisa), ''[[ayah]]'' 69&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|69|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Biblical stories retold in the Quran in the Arabic language (e.g., Job, Moses, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]] ([[Joseph in Islam|Yusuf]]) etc.) certainly differ from the Jewish [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[Greek Old Testament]] and the Greek [[New Testament]], in that the Quran always demonstrates that it is "God's practice" (''[[sunnat Allah]]'') to make faith triumph finally over the forces of evil and adversity. "We have made the [[Shaitan|evil ones]] friends to those without faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|7|27|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Assuredly God will defend those who believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|22|49|e=133|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eoi-84&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosskeen Gibb,|first1=Hamilton Alexander|last2=Pellat|first2=Charles|last3=Schacht|first3=Joseph|last4=Lewis,|first4=Bernard|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|date=1973|publisher=Brill|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the [[Islamic view of Jesus' death|Islamic Isa]] did not die on the cross like the Christian thought about Jesus, but deceived his enemies and ascended to heaven.

The prophets and messengers "share no divine attributes", and possess "no knowledge or power" other than that granted to them by God.&lt;ref name=EHHoF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Al-Amriki|first1=Yusuf Talal Ali|last2=Ullah|first2=Qazi Thanaa|title=Essential Hanafi Handbook of Fiqh|date=1985|publisher=Kazi Publications|location=Lahore, Pakistan|pages=23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Numbers ===
Muslims believe that many prophets existed, including many not mentioned in the Quran.

But Abu’l-Faraj ibn al-Jazwi disagreed with him and included this hadeeth in his book ''al-Mawdoo‘aat'' (the fabricated hadeeths) and accused Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam of fabricating the hadeeth. There is no doubt that more than one of the imams of ''al-jarh wa’t-ta‘deel'' (evaluation of hadeeth narrators) criticised him because of this hadeeth. "&lt;/ref&gt; and Shu'ayb al-Arna'oot&lt;ref&gt;''Tahqeeq Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan'', 2/79, "Shu‘ayb al-Arna’oot said: Its ''isnaad'' is ''da‘eef jiddan'' (very weak) – and he quoted the comments of the scholars about Ibraaheem ibn Hishaam."&lt;/ref&gt; the narration is weak, if not fabricated.

=== Female prophets ===
Most mainstream [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] scholars agree that prophets were males only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = There were no female prophets - Islam web - English|url = http://www.islamweb.net/emainpage/index.php?page=showfatwa&amp;Option=FatwaId&amp;Id=31788|website = www.islamweb.net|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}} Still, some like [[Ibn Hazm]], [[Al-Qurtubi|Qartubi]], [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]], and [[Ash'ari|al Ash‘ari]] thought that the verses that mention angels speaking to Mary are proofs of her prophethood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Surat 'Ali `Imran [3:42] - The Noble Qur'an - القرآن الكريم|url = http://legacy.quran.com/3/42|website = legacy.quran.com|accessdate = 2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/158044&lt;nowiki/&gt;With regard to Prophethood, some of the scholars – such as Abu’l-Hasan al-Ash‘ari, al-Qurtubi and Ibn Hazm – were of the view that there were some female Prophets! including Maryam bint ‘Imraan. Their evidence is the verses in which it says that Allah, may He be exalted, sent revelation to the mother of Moosa, for example, and what it says about the angels speaking to Maryam (peace be upon her), and also what it says about Allah, may He be exalted, having chosen her above the women of the world.
&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=October 2018}}  Also, [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani|Ibn Hajir]] interprets the Hadith "Many among men attained perfection but among women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of `Imran; and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh." He said perfection is prophethood, hence his claim that Mary and [[Asiya]] were prophets.&lt;ref&gt;http://islamqa.info/en/7181&lt;nowiki/&gt;The scholars differed as to the meaning of the perfection of women. Some said, it refers to Prophethood.

Ibn Hajar said in "''al-Fath''":

"… it is as if he said: No women attained Prophethood except for So and so and So and so." (''al-Fath'', 6/447).
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptures and other gifts ==

=== Holy books ===
{{See also|Islamic holy books}}
The revealed books are the records which Muslims believe were dictated by God to various Islamic prophets throughout the history of mankind, all these books promulgated the code and laws of Islam. The belief in all the revealed books is an [[Creed#Islamic creed|article of faith]] in Islam and Muslims must believe in all the scriptures to be a Muslim. Muslims believe the Quran, the final holy scripture, was sent because all the previous holy books had been either [[Tahrif|corrupted]] or lost.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Holy Books"&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Islam speaks of respecting all the previous scriptures, even in their current forms.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Quran mentions some Islamic scriptures by name, which came before the Quran:
* ''[[Torah in Islam|Tawrat]]'' ([[Torah]]): According to the Quran, the Tawrat (Torah) was revealed to Moses,&lt;ref name="Q5336"&gt;{{Cite quran|53|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims believe that the current Pentateuch, although it retains the main message,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|87|18|e=19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; has suffered corruption over the years. Moses and his brother Haroon ([[Aaron]]) used the Torah to preach the message to the Children of Israel. The Quran implies that the Torah is the longest-used scripture, with the [[Jews|Jewish]] people still using the Torah today, and that all the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] prophets would warn the people of any corruptions that were in the scripture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|5|44|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus, in Muslim belief, was the last prophet to be taught the [[Law of Moses|Mosaic Law]] in its true form.
* ''[[Zabur]]'' ([[Psalms]]): The Quran mentions the Psalms as being the holy scripture revealed to David. Scholars have often understood the Psalms to have been holy songs of praise.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Psalms"&lt;/ref&gt; The current Psalms are still praised by many Muslim scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Martin Lings, ''Mecca''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdul Malik, ''In Thy Seed''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Muslims generally assume that some of the current Psalms were written later and are not divinely revealed.
* Book of Enlightenment ([[Arabic]]: &lt;big&gt;كِتَابُ ٱلْمُنِير&lt;/big&gt; ''Kitābu ’l-Munīr''): The Quran mentions a ''Book of Enlightenment'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}} and {{Cite quran|35|25|s=ns|b=n}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has alternatively been translated as ''Scripture of Enlightenment'' or the ''Illuminating Book''. It mentions that some prophets, in the past, came with clear signs from God as well as this particular scripture.
* Books of Divine Wisdom ([[Arabic]]: possibly identified as &lt;big&gt;الْزُبُر&lt;/big&gt; ''az-Zubur''): The Quran mentions certain ''Books of Divine Wisdom'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|184|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; translated by some scholars as ''Books of Dark Prophecies'', which are a reference to particular books vouchsafed to some prophets, wherein there was wisdom for man. Some scholars have suggested that these may be one and the same as the Psalms as their root Arabic word, ''Zubur'' (Quran 35:25) - the plural for the word "Scriptures", comes from the same source as the Arabic ''Zabur'' for the Psalms.
* ''[[Gospel in Islam|İnjil]]'' ([[Gospel]]): The İnjil (Gospel) was the holy book revealed to Jesus, according to the Quran. Although many lay Muslims believe the ''Injil'' refers to the entire New Testament, scholars have clearly pointed out that it refers not to the New Testament but to an original Gospel, which was sent by God, and was given to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary'', Appendix: "On the Injil"&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, according to Muslim belief, the Gospel was the message that Jesus, being divinely inspired, preached to the Children of Israel. The current [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonical Gospels]], in the belief of Muslim scholars, are not divinely revealed but rather are documents of the life of Jesus, as written by various contemporaries, disciples and companions. These Gospels contain portions of Jesus's teachings but do not represent the original Gospel, which was a single book written not by a human but was sent by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', "Injil"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Scrolls of Abraham]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ إِبْرَهِيم ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’Ibrahīm'') The Scrolls of Abraham are believed to have been one of the earliest bodies of scripture, which were vouchsafed to Abraham,&lt;ref name="quran8719"&gt;{{Cite quran|87|19|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later used by Ishmael and Isaac. Although usually referred to as 'scrolls/ manuscript', many translators have translated the Arabic ''Suhuf'' as 'the Scriptures'.&lt;ref&gt;Marmaduke Pickthall, ''The Meaning of the Glorious Quran''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}; Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Scrolls of Abraham are now considered lost rather than corrupted, although some scholars{{who ?|date=May 2018}} have identified them with the [[Testament of Abraham]], an [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic piece of literature]] available in Arabic at the time of Muhammad{{source needed|date=May 2018}}. The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".
* [[Scrolls of Moses]]: ([[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ ٱلْأُولَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Ūlā'' - "Books of the Earliest Revelation" and/or [[Arabic]]: الْصُّحُفِ مُوسَى ''aṣ-Ṣuḥufi ’l-Mūsā'') These scrolls, containing the revelations of Moses, which were perhaps written down later by Moses, Aaron and [[Joshua]], are understood by Muslims to refer not to the Torah but to revelations aside from the Torah. Some scholars have stated that they could possibly refer to the [[Book of the Wars of the Lord]],&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah Yusuf Ali, ''The Holy Quran: Text, Translation and Commentary''{{page needed|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a lost text spoken of in the Hebrew Bible.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers 21:14&lt;/ref&gt; The verse mentioning the "Scriptures" is in Quran 87:18-19 where they are referred to "Books of the Earliest Revelation".

=== Holy gifts ===
{{Religious text primary|section|date=June 2011}}
The Quran mentions various divinely-bestowed gifts given to various prophets. These may be interpreted as books or forms of celestial knowledge. Although all prophets are believed by Muslims to have been immensely gifted, special mention of "wisdom" or "knowledge" for a particular prophet is understood to mean that some secret knowledge was revealed to him. The Quran mentions that Abraham prayed for wisdom and later received it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|26|83|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also mentions that Joseph&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|10|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Moses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|28|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; both attained wisdom when they reached full age; David received wisdom with kingship, after slaying [[Goliath]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|2|251|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]] ([[Lot in Islam|Lut]] received wisdom whilst prophesying in [[Sodom and Gomorrah]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|21|74|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Baptist received wisdom while still a mere youth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|19|14|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesus received wisdom and was vouchsafed the Gospel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|3|48|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prophets and messengers ==

=== Prophethood in Ahmadiyya ===
{{main article|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}
The [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadiyya Community]] does not believe that messengers and prophets are different individuals. They interpret the Quranic words ''warner'' (''[[nadhir]]''), ''prophet'', and ''messenger'' as referring to different roles that the same divinely appointed individuals perform. Ahmadiyya distinguish only between law-bearing prophets and non-law-bearing ones. They believe that although law-bearing prophethood ended with Muhammad, non-law-bearing prophethood subordinate to Muhammad continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brand|first=Alexa|date=2016|title=Placing the Marginalized Ahmadiyya in Context with the Traditional Sunni Majority|url=https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|dead-url=no|journal=3|publisher=Journal of Mason Graduate Research|volume=3|pages=122-123|issn=2327-0764|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006041014/https://journals.gmu.edu/jmgr/article/download/1330/1142|archive-date=2018-10-06|via=Mason Publishing Journals (at [[George Mason University]])}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e85|title=Ahmadis - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ahmadiyya Community recognizes [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] also known as Mirza Qadiani (1835–1908) as such a “prophet” of gods and the promised [[Messiah]] and [[Imam]] [[Mahdi]] of the latter days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mirza-Ghulam-Ahmad|title=Mirza Ghulam Ahmad {{!}} Biography &amp; Facts|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement for the Propagation of Islam|Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement]] rejects his status as a prophet, instead considering him to be a renewer of the faith.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, all other Muslims and their scholars argue and firmly establish that the Ahmadiyya community are not even Muslim due to the fact their beliefs violate the Muslim belief in Muhammad as the "Seal of the Prophets" (Khatam an-Nabiyyin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Other persons ==
The Quran mentions 25 prophets by name but also tells that God (Allah) sent many other prophets and messengers, to all the different nations that have existed on Earth. Many verses in the Qur'an discuss this:
* "We did aforetime send messengers before thee: of them there are some whose story We have related to thee, and some whose story We have not related to thee...."&lt;ref name="quran4078"&gt;{{cite quran|40|78|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "For We assuredly sent amongst every People a messenger, ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|16|36|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other special persons in the Qur'an ===
* [[Caleb#Quranic account|Caleb (Kaleb)]]: In the Quran, Caleb is mentioned in the 5th [[surah]] of the Quran (5:20-26).
* [[Dhul-Qarnayn]]: Dhul-Qarnayn.  
* [[Joachim#In Islam|Joachim (Imran)]]: The [[Al Imran|Family of Imran]] ([[Arabic]]: '''آل عمران''') is the 3rd chapter of the Quran. ''Imran'' is [[Arabic]] for the biblical figure [[Amram]], the father of Moses and Aaron, who is regarded by Muslims as being the ancestor of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] ([[Mary in Islam|Maryām]]) and Jesus through his son Aaron. In Muslim belief, however, the [[Christian]] Joachim has been attributed the name Imran as well.
* [[Khidr]]: The Quran also mentions the mysterious Khidr (but does not name him), identified at times with [[Melchizedek]], who is the figure that Moses accompanies on one journey. Although most Muslims regard him as an enigmatic saint or an angel,&lt;ref&gt;Jill Caskey, Adam S. Cohen, Linda Safran ''Confronting the Borders of Medieval Art'' BRILL 2011 {{ISBN|978-9-004-20749-3}} page 124&lt;/ref&gt; some see him as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/863824465|title=The A to Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism|last=Noegel|first=Scott B.|last2=Wheeler|first2=Brannon M.|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9781461718956|location=Lanham|pages=196-197|oclc=863824465}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luqman]]: The Quran mentions the [[Wise old man|sage]] Luqman in [[Luqman (sura)|the chapter]] named after him, but does not clearly identify him as a prophet. The most widespread Islamic belief&lt;ref&gt;''A-Z of Prophets in Islam'', B. M. Wheeler, "Luqman"&lt;/ref&gt; views Luqman as a [[saint]], but not as a prophet. The Arabic term ''[[wali]]'' (Arabic ولي, plural Awliyā' أولياء) is commonly translated into English as "Saint". However, the wali should not be confused with the Christian tradition of sainthood. A key difference is that the wali continues what a prophet taught without any change. However, other Muslims regard Luqman as a prophet as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Concise Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Cyril Glasse, "Prophets in Islam"&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary in Islam|Mary (Maryam)]]: A few scholars (such as [[Ibn Hazm]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|title=Imam Ibn Hazm: On Prophethood of Women|last=Farooq|first=Mohammad Omar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050312084433/http://www.globalwebpost.com/farooqm/study_res/islam/gender/women_prophethood.html|archive-date=2005-03-12|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ibrahim|first=Mohammed Zayki|date=2015|title=Ibn Ḥazm’s theory of prophecy of women: Literalism, logic, and perfection|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|dead-url=no|journal=Intellectual Discourse|publisher=IIUM Press|volume=23|issue=1|pages=76-77|issn=0128-4878|eissn=2289-5639|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006035648/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.831.1259&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|archive-date=2018-10-05|via=[[CiteSeerX]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; see Maryam (Mary) as a ''nabi'' and a prophetess, since God sent her a message via an angel. The Quran, however, does not explicitly identify her as a prophet. Islamic belief regards her as one of the holiest of women, but not as a prophet.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond The Exotic: Women's Histories In Islamic Societies'', p. 402. Ed. Amira El-Azhary Sonbol. [[Syracuse University Press]], 2005. {{ISBN|9780815630555}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[People of Ya-Sin|Three persons of the town]]: These three unnamed person, who were sent to the same town, are referenced in [[Ya Sin|chapter 36]] of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|36|13|e=21|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}}
* [[Saul#In Islam|Saul]] ([[Talut]]): Saul is not considered a prophet, but a divinely appointed king.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2115|title=Saul - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|last=|first=|date=|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacob#Children of Jacob|Sons of Jacob]]: These men are sometimes not considered to be prophets, although most exegesis scholars consider them to be prophets, citing the hadith of Muhammad and their status as prophets in Judaism. The reason that some do not consider them as prophets is because of their behaviour with Yusuf (Joseph) and that they lied to their father.

=== Other people mentioned in Islamic literature ===
Numerous other people have been mentioned by scholars in the Hadith, [[exegesis]], [[Tafsir|commentary]]. These people include:

'''Rajan Srinivasan Mahadevan''' is an Indian [[mnemonist]].

== Early life ==
Mahadevan was  born in [[Madras]] in 1957 and moved to [[Mangalore]] in 1959. He discovered his ability to memorize numbers at the age of 5 during a party hosted by his family. During the party, Rajan wandered to a parking lot and committed the license plate numbers of every guest's car for recitation later.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Education ==
In 1977, after losing interest in engineering, Mahadevan set to memorize substantial parts of [[pi (mathematical constant)|pi]]. On 5 July 1981, he recited from memory the first 31,811 digits of [[pi (mathematical constant)|pi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brainyhistory.com/events/1981/july_5_1981_154000.html Rajan Mahadevan recites 31,811 digits of ã from memory 5 July in History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This secured him a place in the 1984 ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'', and he has been featured on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.undergrad.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/~blstuart/accomplishments.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051221103731/http://undergrad.ahs.uwaterloo.ca/~blstuart/accomplishments.html |archivedate=21 December 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahadevan received his bachelor's degree in psychology in 1984 and his master's degree in clinical psychology from the [[University of Mysore]] in 1986 during his extended participation in memory study. Mahadevan's [[digit span]] was found to be nearly ten times the average; it is estimated that, before the effects of practice, it was 15 digits.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Although Mahadevan is adept at remembering numbers, he nevertheless displays only an average memory when it comes to prose passages or geometric shapes.&lt;ref&gt;DAVID R. SHANKS, Science Spectra, 1999, Number 18. [http://www.indiana.edu/~jkkteach/P335/shanks_expertise.html Outstanding Performers: Created, Not Born? NEW RESULTS ON NATURE VS. NURTURE.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahadevan holds the position of Distinguished Lecturer at the [[University of Tennessee]], where he teaches courses in learning and thinking as well as cognitive psychology.

He was the host of the shows ''[[This Week in Enterprise Tech]]'' and ''[[Know How...]]'' on the [[TWiT.tv]] network.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Ballecer was born on May 29, 1978 in [[Hayward, California]],&lt;ref name="Mission"/&gt; and grew up in [[Fremont, California]].&lt;ref name="Mercury News"/&gt; His parents had emigrated to the United States in 1970, and he grew up in a traditional Filipino household.&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt;  He would [[dumpster dive]] for computer parts and built his own computer.&lt;ref name="Mercury News"/&gt;  In the 1980s, he ran an online bulletin board system.&lt;ref name="PCmag"/&gt;  He started working for R&amp;A Professional Consultants in 1988.&lt;ref name="TWiT profile"/&gt;

===Education===
Ballecer studied at [[Bellarmine College Preparatory]] and [[Santa Clara University]], where he majored in computer engineering, though he also became interested in becoming a Catholic priest.&lt;ref name="NCR1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury News"/&gt;  He joined the [[Jesuit]]s in 1994 and ran a computer server to put the order's California Province online.&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt; He studied philosophy at [[Loyola University Chicago]], and then taught computer programming at [[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola High School]] in [[Los Angeles]]. He studied theology at the [[Jesuit School of Theology of Santa Clara University]].&lt;ref name="Mission"/&gt;

===Career===
Ballecer helped the Jesuits set up their own email addresses and started websites for Jesuit high schools.&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt;  He served at the Most Holy Trinity Catholic Church in San Jose, and was named director of the Center for Apostolic Technology. In his vocation, he oversaw efforts to encourage young men to pursue the priesthood.&lt;ref name="Mercury News"/&gt;  For four years starting in 2009, he worked for the [[Jesuit Conference]] as the National Director of Vocation Promotion in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercury News"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jesuits West"/&gt;  He produced a series of short films titled ''Jesuits Revealed'' to improve the Jesuits' online image.&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt;

He became a fan of the [[TechTV]] show ''[[The Screen Savers]]'', which ran in the late 1990s and 2000s.&lt;ref name="PCmag"/&gt;  He started blogging for "The Tech Stop" in 2001.&lt;ref name="TWiT profile"/&gt;  [[Leo Laporte]] found Ballecer in TWiT's chat room in 2010. Laporte asked the chat room who could host show on enterprise technology, and the chat room suggested "PadreSJ", the chat handle for Robert Ballecer, could host this show. Ballecer started hosting the show ''This Week in Enterprise Tech'', anchoring live events, and hosting the [[do-it-yourself]] show ''Know How...''.&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt;  He has also appeared as a guest on other [[TWiT.tv]] shows, and hosted ''Coding 101'' and ''Padre's Corner''.&lt;ref name="TWiT profile"/&gt;  Ballecer lived in [[St. Ignatius College Preparatory]] in San Francisco in 2016.&lt;ref name="NCR2"/&gt;

'''Robert Rhett''' (born '''Robert Barnwell Smith'''; December 21, 1800{{spaced ndash}}September 14, 1876) was an American [[politician]] who served as a deputy from [[South Carolina]] to the [[Provisional Confederate States Congress]] from 1861 to 1862, a member of the [[US House of Representatives]] from South Carolina from 1837 to 1849, and [[US Senator]] from South Carolina from 1850 to 1852. A pro-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] extremist and an early advocate of [[secession]], he was a "[[Fire-Eaters|Fire-Eater]]".

Rhett published his views through his newspaper, the ''[[Charleston Mercury]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZZdJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dQwNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3798,3556997&amp;dq=charleston+mercury&amp;hl=en The Secession] Charleston ''News and Courier'' - December 18, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
He was born Robert Barnwell Smith in [[Beaufort, South Carolina|Beaufort]], South Carolina, United States. He later studied law.

==Early career==
He was a member of the South Carolina legislature in 1826 until 1832. He was extremely pro-slavery in his views. At the end of the [[Nullification Crisis]] in 1833, he told the South Carolina Nullification Convention:

{{quote|A people, owning slaves, are mad, or worse than mad, who do not hold their destinies in their own hands.&lt;ref&gt;Freehling, William W. ''Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816-1836'', p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1832, Rhett became South Carolina [[attorney general]] and served until 1837. He was then elected US Representative and served until 1849. In 1838, he changed his last name from Smith to that of a prominent colonial ancestor, Colonel [[William Rhett]]. He objected vehemently to the protectionist [[Tariff of 1842]].

==Support for secession==
On July 31, 1844, he launched the [[Bluffton Movement]], which called for South Carolina to return to nullification or else declare secession. It was soon repudiated by more moderate South Carolina Democrats, including even Senator [[John C. Calhoun]], who feared it would endanger the presidential candidacy of [[James K. Polk]].

Rhett opposed the [[Compromise of 1850]] as against the interests of the slave-holding South. He joined fellow Fire-Eaters at the [[Nashville Convention]] of 1850, which failed to endorse his aim of secession for the whole South. After the Nashville Convention, Rhett, [[William Lowndes Yancey]], and a few others met in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] on August 21, 1850, and formed the short-lived Southern National Party. In December 1850, he was became US Senator to complete the term left by the death of Calhoun. He continued to advocate secession in response to the Compromise, but in 1852, South Carolina refrained from declaring secession and merely passed an ordinance declaring a state's right to secede. Disappointed, he resigned his Senate seat.

He continued to express his fiery secessionist sentiments through the ''Charleston Mercury'', now edited by his son, Robert Jr.

The [[1860 Democratic National Conventions|1860 Democratic National Convention]] met in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] and a large bloc of Southern delegates walked out when the platform was insufficiently pro-slavery. That led to the division of the party and separate Northern and Southern nominees for President, which practically guaranteed the election of an anti-slavery [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], which in turn triggered declarations of secession in seven states. During the [[United States presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential campaign]], a widely-credited report in the ''Nashville Patriot'' said that the outcome was the intended result of a conspiracy by Rhett, Yancey, and [[William Porcher Miles]] hatched at the Southern Convention in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], [[Alabama]], in May 1858.&lt;ref&gt;[[Allan Nevins]], ''The War for the Union'', vol. 1: ''The Improvised War, 1861-1862'' (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1959), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confederate States==
After the election of the Republican Party's [[Abraham Lincoln]], Rhett was elected to the South Carolina Secession Convention, which declared secession in December. He was chosen as deputy from South Carolina to the Provisional Confederate States Congress in Montgomery. He was one of the most active deputies and was the chairman of the committee that reported the [[Confederate States Constitution]]. He was then elected to the [[Confederate Congress|Confederate House of Representatives]]. He received no higher office in the Confederate government and returned to South Carolina. During the rest of the [[American Civil War]], he sharply criticized the policies of [[President of the Confederate States of America|President]] [[Jefferson Davis]].

==Later life==
After the war. Rhett settled in [[Louisiana]]. Contrary to rumors, he was not a delegate to the [[1868 Democratic National Convention]], but it was his son, Robert Rhett Jr., who had shared his father's editorship responsibilities. He died in [[St. James Parish, Louisiana|St. James Parish]], [[Louisiana]], and is interred at Magnolia Cemetery in Charleston.

==Ancestry==
Rhett was of English ancestry. On his mother's side, he was related to U.S. Representative [[Robert Barnwell]] (his great-uncle) and Senator [[Robert Woodward Barnwell]] (son of Robert). A cousin of the Barnwells was the wife of [[Alexander Garden (soldier)|Alexander Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Davis |first=William C. |author-link=William C.

'''Reverend Robert Taylor''' (18 August 1784 – September 1844), was an early 19th-century [[Historical radicalism|Radical]], a [[clergyman]] turned [[freethought|freethinker]]. His "Infidel home missionary tour" was an incident in [[Charles Darwin's education]], leaving Darwin with a memory of "'''the Devil's Chaplain'''" as a warning of the dangers of dissent from [[Church of England]] doctrine.

==Early life==

He was the sixth son of John and Elizabeth Taylor, born at Walnut Tree House, [[Edmonton, London]], on 18 August 1784. His father, an ironmonger in [[Fenchurch Street]], London, died when he was young, leaving him under the guardianship of his uncle, Edward Farmer Taylor of Chicken Hall, [[Bridgnorth]], [[Shropshire]]. Having been at school under John Adams at Edmonton, he was articled as house pupil to Samuel Partridge, then house surgeon at the [[Birmingham General Hospital]].&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Taylor, Robert (1784-1844)|volume=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Birmingham Taylor underwent a religious conversion, after hearing [[Edward Burn]] preach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=27078|title=Taylor, Robert|first=K. D.|last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805 Taylor continued as a medical student, walking Guy's and St. Thomas's hospitals in London under [[Sir Astley Paston Cooper]] and [[Henry Cline]], and was admitted a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|College of Surgeons]] in 1807. Under the influence of Thomas Cotterill, perpetual curate of [[Lane End, Staffordshire]], he decided to study for the church.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Qualification and turn to anti-clericalism==
Taylor studied at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] for three years to qualify as a clergyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TLR808R|name=Taylor, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time the [[University of Cambridge]] was dominated by the established [[Church of England]] and most students were preparing for positions in the Anglican church. The Revd. [[Charles Simeon]] got Taylor his first curacy, but five years after ordination Taylor abandoned [[orthodox Christianity]] for [[evangelism]] and then eccentric [[anti-clericalism]].

Taylor set up a ''Christian Evidence Society'' and lectured in [[London]] [[public house|pubs]] dressed in elaborate vestments, attacking the Anglican [[liturgy]] and the barbarities of the Establishment for what he called its "Pagan creed". At this time [[blasphemy]] was a criminal offence against the faith "by law established", and he was sentenced to a year in [[gaol]]. In his cell he wrote ''The Diegesis'', attacking Christianity on the basis of [[comparative mythology]] and attempting to expound it as a scheme of [[solar myth]]s.

He was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]] and has been described as a "staunch defender of the mythicist thesis".&lt;ref&gt;Jongeneel, Jan A. B. (2009). ''Jesus Christ in World History: His Presence and Representation in Cyclical and Linear Settings''. Peter Lang. p. 210. {{ISBN|978-3-631-59688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George H. Smith|Smith, George H]]. (1991). ''Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies''. Prometheus Books. p. 177. {{ISBN|978-0879755775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infidel home missionary tour==
Upon his release, with his book newly published, he joined forces with the Radical [[Richard Carlile]] for an "infidel home missionary tour". On Thursday 21 May 1829, they arrived in [[Cambridge]], strolled round the colleges, and in the evening attended Holy Trinity Church for a hell-fire sermon by the Revd. Simeon, which they sneered at as "one of the worst imaginable for the morals of mankind".

Next day they rented lodgings for a fortnight above a print shop in Rose Crescent from the unsuspecting landlord William Smith, as their "Infidel Head-Quarters". By noon they had sent a printed challenge to the Vice-Chancellor, the leading Doctors of Divinity, the heads of all the colleges and the Revd. Simeon:

{{quotation|
:::CIRCULAR

:The Rev. Robert Taylor, A.B., of Carey Street, Lincoln's Inn, and Mr. Richard Carlile, of Fleet-street, London, present their compliments as Infidel missionaries, to (''as it may be'') and most respectfully and earnestly invite discussion on the merits of the Christian religion, which they argumentatively challenge, in the confidence of their competence to prove, that such a person as Jesus Christ, alleged to have been of Nazareth, never existed; and that the Christian religion has no such origin as has been pretended; neither is it in any way beneficial to mankind; but that it is nothing more than an emanation from the ancient Pagan religion. The researches of the Rev. Robert Taylor, on the subject, are embodied in his newly published work, THE DIEGESIS, in which may be found the routine of their argument.

:They also impugn the honesty of a continued preaching, while discussion is challenged on the whole of the merits of the Christian religion.

:At home, for conversation, at any appointed time. 7, Rose Crescent.}}

They then went around the University precincts, with Taylor immaculately dressed in university cap and gown greeting old friends, giving out circulars and seeking out [[freethought|freethinkers]].

On the Saturday morning an anticipated article about their mission failed to appear in the morning paper. The university Proctors who were in charge of discipline interrogated the landlord, then demanded his lodging-house licence. Smith refused to hand it over, and appealed to the Vice-Chancellor, "most deferentially" asking the reason as he had not violated any regulations, and the licence had been granted its annual renewal the day before, but received no reply. The Vice-Chancellor and Proctors revoked the licence and made the lodgings out of bounds, posting a notice in the butteries of all the colleges to warn the students, among them [[Charles Darwin]], then in his second year.

The Radical pair responded to this "paltry spite" the next day by putting a public notice on the door of the University Library, challenging a university that "punishes the innocent... crushes the weak... oppresses [and] persecutes", taking away half the livelihood of Smith, with his wife and six children. On Monday all the students were talking about this iniquitous situation, and a group of "young men" prepared vigilante action against the Radicals to avenge the landlord. Carlile and Taylor heard of this, and on Tuesday apologised to the landlord, prodded the authorities to restore his licence, and slipped out of town. They were satisfied that they had uncovered "about fifty... young collegians, who were somewhat bold in vowing Infidelity among each other", though few would "break... the shackles" of their education and they would have "a most painful conflict to endure."

Their tour included [[Lancashire]], and at a meeting in [[Bolton]] they met [[Eliza Sharples]], who was to continue propagating their message in performances at the Rotunda while they were imprisoned.&lt;ref name=Pythoness&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Pythoness of the Temple’: Eliza Sharples and the gendered public of the Rotunda|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/apps/bookworm/view/Radical+Spaces%3A+Venues+of+popular+politics+in+London,+1790%E2%80%93c.+1845/5621/ch08.xhtml|publisher=ANU|accessdate=27 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Devil's Chaplain==
Amidst public unrest in July 1830 when [[Charles X of France]] was deposed by middle class republicans and given refuge in England by the [[Tory]] government of [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], Carlile gave Taylor a platform in the [[Blackfriars Rotunda]], a ramshackle building on the south bank of the [[River Thames]] where [[Republicanism|republican]] [[atheist]]s gathered. Several times a week Taylor dressed in "canonicals", staged infidel melodramas, preaching bombastic sermons to [[artisan]]s. Two Sunday sermons on "The Devil" caused particular outrage when he pronounced "God and the Devil... to be but one and the self-same being... Hell and Hell-fire... are, in the original, nothing more than names and titles of the Supreme God." He was then dubbed "The Devil's Chaplain", and thousands of copies of his ceremonies were circulated in a seditious publication, ''The Devil's Pulpit''. As the Tory government collapsed in November, Taylor preached against the establishment while a revolutionary tricolour flew from the roof of ''The Rotunda''.

At the start of April 1831 Taylor was again indicted for blasphemy over two Easter sermons in the last days of ''The Rotunda''. He was sentenced to two years' imprisonment in [[Horsemonger Lane Gaol]] whence he sent protesting letters to ''[[The Times]]'', but his pleas were snubbed by the [[Home Secretary]] [[William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne]]. In a letter to W.Watts, Taylor described his physical decline and fear that "the Christians have determined to kill me... I never expect to leave this Bastile but Heels foremost. Your greatly obliged Murdered Friend, Robert Taylor." (Despite his fears, he lived until 1844. The letter is now in the possession of Larry M. Wright, author of 'Christianity Astrology and Myth'.)

By January 1832 a "new occupation of the building" was promoted around London. From prison Taylor wrote that "the spirit of the Rotunda lives", and "it opens with new spirit, with new attraction, with all that is lovely and virtuous in woman to grace it." From 9 February [[Eliza Sharples]] appeared as "Isis", the "Lady of the Rotunda", giving theatrically presented lectures which energetically decried Christianity, the priesthood, and the political establishment. In the first lecture she said she was "neither of Taylor nor Carlisle; neither of Owen nor St Simon", but would "be the little busy bee extracting honey from all their doctrines". There were soon claims that her lectures were, at least in part, written by Taylor and Carlisle. Her fiery presentations initially attracted attention, but interest fell away and her lectures finished at the end of April.&lt;ref name=Pythoness /&gt;

==Darwin recalls Taylor ==
Taylor would be remembered by Charles Darwin as a warning example of a social pariah. In 1857 as he worked towards the [[Publication of Darwin's theory|publication of his theory]] he wrote "What a book a Devil's Chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering low &amp; horridly cruel works of Nature!" in what Desmond and Moore argue is a reference to Taylor's nickname. However the term "the Devil's Chaplain" goes back to [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] who has [[The Parson's Prologue and Tale|his Parson]] say "Flatereres been the develes chapelleyns, that [[Placebo (at funeral)|syngen evere placebo]]."

As the [[reaction to Darwin's theory]] developed in March 1860 he described his close ally [[Thomas Huxley]] as his "good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel &amp;ndash; i.e. the devil's gospel."

The Gordons were [[crime fiction]] [[author]]s '''Gordon Gordon''' (born March 12, 1906, [[Anderson, Indiana]] – died March 14, 2002), and his wife, '''Mildred Nixon Gordon''' (born June 24, 1912, [[Kansas]] – died February 3, 1979, [[Tucson, Arizona]]). Both attended the [[University of Arizona]] where they met and later married in 1932. They wrote numerous [[crime fiction]] novels, some of which were filmed.&lt;ref name="Gordon Gordon"&gt;[http://iwp.iweb.bsu.edu/IndianaAuthors/Pages/Gordon%20Gordon.html Gordon Gordon profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060914210445/http://iwp.iweb.bsu.edu/IndianaAuthors/Pages/Gordon%20Gordon.html |date=2006-09-14 }}, iwp.iweb.bsu.edu; accessed November 19, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these feature fictional protagonist FBI agent John "Rip" Ripley (as noted below). After they learned that the screenwriter of ''Make Haste to Live'' received $40,000 while they, the authors, only received $5000, the Gordons insisted on writing the screenplays for their books being filmed.&lt;ref name="Gordon Gordon"/&gt; Gordon was an editor of the ''[[Tucson Citizen]]'' newspaper and a publicist with [[20th Century Fox]] from 1935 to 1942, and later served as an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] [[counter-intelligence]] agent during [[World War II]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;''Society of Former Agents of the FBI'' 1998, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Mildred Gordon was a teacher and an editor for ''[[Arizona Highways]]'' magazine. She worked for [[United Press]] and wrote ''The Little Man Who Wasn't There'' (1946). After Mildred's death in 1979, Gordon remarried Mary Dorr (1918–2004) on March 16, 1980. They wrote ''Race for the Golden Tide'' (1983) and ''The Hong Kong Affair'' (1998).{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} Gordon and Dorr created the Excellence in Media Angel Awards.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

He served as Speaker of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|House of Representatives]] from November 2003 until August 2009, when the LDP lost its majority in the [[Japanese general election, 2009|2009 election]]. Kōno served as speaker for the longest length since the set up of House of Representatives in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kono's tenure longest as speaker|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20081120a9.html|accessdate=22 November 2008|work=The Japan Times |date=20 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He was the president of the [[Japan Association of Athletics Federations]] from 1999 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaaf.or.jp/rikuren/about.html {{Nihongo||日本陸連歴代会長・理事長・専務理事|The Successive President and Vice-President and Senior-Managing-Director of JAAF}}] {{ja icon}} [[Japan Association of Athletics Federations]]. Retrieved 13 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Kōno is the eldest son of [[Ichirō Kōno]], a former minister dealing with the [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympic Games]].  [[Kenzō Kōno]], the chairman of the [[House of Councillors]] is his younger uncle.

After graduating from [[Waseda University]], Kōno worked with the [[Marubeni]] company. In 1967, Kono's political career began due to the death of his father.

== Political career ==

He was Deputy Prime Minister from 1994 to 1995. He was Minister of Foreign Affairs under Prime Minister [[Tomiichi Murayama]] and Murayama's successor [[Yoshirō Mori]]. He is a member of the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP). He was once President of the LDP from 1993 to 1995, and to date is the only LDP leader except for [[Sadakazu Tanigaki]] to have never served as [[Prime Minister of Japan]]. As he is one of the pro-Chinese members of the LDP, he came under pressure domestically in the spring of 2005 when anti-Japanese movements in China became intense.

Kōno is well known as a controversial figure within the ''[[comfort women]]'' debate, for the [[Kono Statement of 1993|official statement he made in 1993]], when he was Chief Cabinet Secretary. In his statement, made after historian [[Yoshiaki Yoshimi]] announced he had discovered in the Defense Agency library in Tokyo documentary evidence that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] established and ran "comfort stations", he essentially admitted that the Japanese Imperial Army had been involved, directly and indirectly, in the establishment of ''comfort facilities'', and that coercion had been used in the recruitment and retention of the women. His subsequent call for historical research and education aimed at remembering the issue became the basis for addressing the subject of forced prostitution in school history textbooks.
