'''Arkansas Railroad Museum''' is located on Port Road in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Arkansas]] at the former [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway|Cotton Belt]] (SSW) yard.

The former SSW shops are occupied by the historic collection of railroad equipment. This museum is about an hour's drive from Little Rock, AR, and is one of the largest displays of historic railroad equipment in Arkansas. Between the disappearance of SSW in 1992 into parent Southern Pacific and the size of the collection, Arkansas Railroad Museum can be considered an upper-level railroad preservation facility. The Museum is operated by the Cotton Belt Rail Historical Society and local volunteers. The Museum is open Monday through Saturday from 9 AM to 2 PM and on Sunday afternoon by appointment.

Arkansas Railroad Museum is most famous for stabling [[St. Louis Southwestern 819|SSW #819]], the last steam locomotive built by SSW in February 1943. The 819 was restored to operation in 1986. It operated on 13 excursions between 1986 and 1993, but is currently out of service pending completion of an overhaul mandated by the [[Federal Railroad Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;[[St. Louis Southwestern 819]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} A collection of historical passenger cars, mostly lightweight Pullman-Standard equipment, is also kept for use behind 819. The 819 is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The following equipment is at the museum:

Cotton Belt 336, a D3 Mogul built by Baldwin in 1909, is in poor condition and will be cosmetically restored. This locomotive is also listed on the National Register.

== Facility ==
The equipment is mostly housed in the former SSW shops, which was the main heavy repair and erection shop for SSW during the steam era. The shop has such heavy repair equipment as pits, massive overhead cranes, and tools for servicing large railroad equipment. On the east side of the former shops is a transfer table that is still operable. The transfer table is used to move exhibits from time to time. The best time to see the exhibits outside is the first weekend in April (unless that weekend is Easter) when the Museum has its annual show. Many of the exhibits are taken outside so that tables can be set up inside the museum for vendors.

The '''''Art of Mentoring''''' series is a series of books published by [[Basic Books]] from 2001 to 2008, beginning with [[Alan Dershowitz]]'s ''Letters to a Young Lawyer'' and [[Christopher Hitchens]]' ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]''. The books were all titled in the form "Letters to a Young ____", in the spirit of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s book ''[[Letters to a Young Poet]]''. They were meant to be relatively short guides to various occupations or life paths for someone starting out in that field, from the point of view of an expert.

==Creator==
The series was the brainchild of [[John Donatich]], who was the publisher at Basic Books from 1997 to 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v31.n15/story8.html Former Basic Books publisher takes the helm at Yale Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018101216/http://www.yale.edu/opa/arc-ybc/v31.n15/story8.html |date=2012-10-18 }}, ''Yale Bulletin &amp; Calendar'', January 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Board of Education of Oklahoma City v.

'''Bret Sergeant Hart''' (born July 2, 1957) is a [[Canadian-American]] retired professional wrestler, retired amateur wrestler, writer and actor. A member of the [[Hart wrestling family]] and a second-generation wrestler, he has an [[amateur wrestling]] background, wrestling at [[Ernest Manning High School]] and [[Mount Royal University|Mount Royal College]]. A major international [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Draw|draw]] within professional wrestling, he has been credited with changing the perception of mainstream North-American professional wrestling in the early 1990s by bringing technical in-ring performance to the fore.&lt;!--LEDE MATERIAL CITED WITHIN ARTICLE PER WP:LEDE.--&gt; Hart is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time; [[Sky Sports]] noted that [[#Legacy|his legacy]] is that of "one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle". For most of his career, he used the nickname, "Hitman".

Hart joined his father [[Stu Hart]]'s [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] [[Stampede Wrestling]] in 1976 as a referee, and made his in-ring debut in 1978. He gained championship success throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]), where he helmed [[The Hart Foundation]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]]. He left for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) following the controversial "[[Montreal Screwjob]]" in November 1997, where he remained until October 2000. Having been inactive from in-ring competition since January 2000, owing to a December 1999 [[concussion]], he officially retired in October 2000, shortly after his departure from the company. He returned to sporadic in-ring competition from 2010–2011 with WWE, where he won his final championship, headlined the [[SummerSlam (2010)|2010]] [[SummerSlam]] event, and served as the [[Professional wrestling authority figures#Raw brand authorities|general manager]] of [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]. Throughout his career, Hart headlined [[WrestleMania IX]], [[WrestleMania X|X]], and [[WrestleMania XII|XII]], and participated in the main event of [[Starrcade (1997)|Starrcade 1997]] and [[Starrcade (1999)|1999]] – as a [[Professional wrestling match types#Special referee|special enforcer]] and referee in the former.{{Efn|Hart had been a special guest referee for the match before the main event, Larry Zbyszko vs. Eric Bischoff but returned to restart the main event after he deemed Hulk Hogan's victory over Sting illegitimate, he then acted as a refeere for the rest of the main event.&lt;ref name="books.google.se"&gt;https://books.google.se/books?id=G4aFAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT140&amp;dq=sting+hogan+bret&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVpa636MPWAhWKNJoKHZ5kBmIQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sting%20hogan%20bret&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hart has held championships in five decades from the 1970s to the 2010s, with a total of 32 held throughout his career, and 17 held between the WWF/WWE and WCW. Among other accolades, he is a [[List of WWE Champions|five-time]] [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] and a [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions|two-time]] [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship|WCW World Heavyweight Champion]]. Hart has most [[List of WWE Champions#Reigns|combined days as WWF World Heavyweight Champion]] during the 1990s (654), and was the [[List of WCW World Heavyweight Champions#Title history|first]] WCW World Heavyweight Champion born outside the United States. He is the second [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#List of WWE Triple Crown Champions|WWF Triple Crown Champion]] and fifth (with [[Bill Goldberg|Goldberg]]) [[Triple Crown (professional wrestling)#List of WCW Triple Crown Champions|WCW Triple Crown Champion]], and the first man to win both the WWF and WCW Triple Crown Championships. Hart is also the [[Royal Rumble (1994)|1994]] [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] winner (with [[Lex Luger]]), and the only two-time [[King of the Ring]], winning the [[King of the Ring 1991|1991 tournament]] and the first [[King of the Ring (1993)|King of the Ring pay-per-view in 1993]]. [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], with whom Hart headlined multiple [[List of WWE pay-per-view events|pay-per-view events]] as part of [[#Championships and accomplishments|an acclaimed rivalry]] from 1996 to 1997, inducted him into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (2006)|class of 2006]].&lt;!-- ALL MATERIAL IN LEDE CITED WITHIN ARTICLE. --&gt;

Outside of wrestling Hart has appeared in numerous films and television shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as well as featuring in several documentaries, both about himself specifically and others about the wrestling industry in general. Hart also helped found and lent his name to the [[junior hockey|major junior]] [[ice hockey]] team the [[Calgary Hitmen]], and has written two biographies along with a weekly column for the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' for over a decade.

== Early life ==
The eighth child of wrestling patriarch [[Stu Hart]] and his wife Helen, Bret Hart was born in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] into the [[Hart wrestling family]]. He is of [[Greeks|Greek]] descent through his maternal grandmother and Irish through his maternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hart|first1=Diana|last2=McLellan|first2=Kirstie|authorlink=Diana Hart|title=[[Under the Mat: Inside Wrestling's Greatest Family]]|publisher=[[Fenn]]|year=2001|isbn=1-55168-256-7|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|McCoy|2007|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was mainly of [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]] descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=John Lister|title=Slamthology: Collected Wrestling Writings 1991–2004|publisher=jnlister|year=2005|isbn=1-4116-5329-7|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|McCoy|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States since his mother Helen was born in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[Martha Hart]]|author2= Eric Francis|title=Broken Harts: The Life and Death of Owen Hart|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|year=2004|isbn=978-1-59077-036-8|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SLAM!"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingBretHart9799/hitman_may17.html|title=An open letter to Shawn Michaels|date=May 17, 1997|publisher=Slam Wrestling|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305011939/http://slam.canoe.com/SlamWrestlingBretHart9799/hitman_may17.html|archivedate=March 5, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart has stated that he considers himself to be North American and that he is equally proud of his U.S. and Canadian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=412}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather was long-distance runner [[Harry Smith (athlete)|Harry Smith]].

Hart grew up in a household with eleven siblings, seven brothers [[Smith Hart|Smith]], [[Bruce Hart (wrestler)|Bruce]], [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]], [[Wayne Hart (wrestling)|Wayne]], [[Dean Hart|Dean]], [[Ross Hart|Ross]] and [[Owen Hart|Owen]], as well as four sisters, Ellie, Georgia, Alison and [[Diana Hart|Diana]]. As a child he was the closest with his older brother [[Dean Hart|Dean]] who was the nearest to him in age of all his older brothers, being three years his senior. Together they would often fight with Bret's two older sisters, Ellie, who was two years older, and Georgia, who was one year older.&lt;ref name="Hart 2007 11"&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart's family were non-denominational Christians, but he and all of his siblings were baptized by a local Catholic priest.&lt;ref name="Hart 2007 11"/&gt;

Hart spent the vast majority of his childhood in the [[Hart House (Alberta)|Hart family mansion]] which was owned by his father. During one period his father was housing a bear known as [[Terrible Ted]] chained under the building, the bear had had all of its teeth removed and Hart would sometimes as a very young child let the bear lick ice cream off his toes since he thought it was a good way to keep them clean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Hitman/2004/04/17/426674.html|title=Positive heroes key for kids|work=Slam!

His introduction to professional wrestling came at an early age. As a child, he witnessed his father training future wrestlers like [[Superstar Billy Graham|Billy Graham]] in the [[Hart Dungeon|Dungeon]], his household basement which served as a training room. Before school, Hart's father, also a wrestling promoter, had him hand out fliers to local wrestling shows. In the 1998 documentary ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'', Hart reflected on his father's discipline, describing how Stu uttered morbid words while inflicting excruciating [[Grappling hold|submission holds]] that left broken blood vessels in Bret's eyes. Hart claimed his father had an otherwise pleasant demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart's first work in wrestling involved pulling out lucky numbers out of a metal box during intermission at the Stampede Wrestling shows when he was four years old. When he got slightly older he would sell programs to the shows, something all Hart's seven brothers would do. He would often compete for customers with his little brother [[Ross Hart|Ross]] since the fans would often want to buy from the youngest Hart child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amateur wrestling ==
Like his father, Hart was an excellent amateur wrestler since an early age, having begun training as a nine year old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|McCoy|2007|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Ernest Manning High School]], Hart became a standout student in the [[scholastic wrestling|amateur wrestling]] division. Hart has stated that he joined the wrestling team "for the sole reason that my dad expected me to... no-one asked me to."&lt;ref name="DVD"&gt;''[[Bret "Hit Man" Hart: The Best There Is, The Best There Was, The Best There Ever Will Be]]'' (aka "''The Bret Hart Story''"), [[WWE Home Video]] (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; He won significant championships in tournaments throughout [[Alberta]], including the 1974 city championships in Calgary. He scored a victory over competitor Bob Eklund – who would go on to become a [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] national champion, winning "Outstanding Wrestler of the Year 1980–1981"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportuniversitaire.ca/e/championships/wrestling/2008/past.cfm |title="Championship History" |accessdate=2010-08-07 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706204255/http://www.sportuniversitaire.ca/e/championships/wrestling/2008/past.cfm |archivedate=July 6, 2011 |df=mdy }}. [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]]. [[Wayback Machine]]. Retrieved July 6, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; – en route to the championship.&lt;ref name="Hart, Bret 2007 p. 32"&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart describes the moment where he displayed the medal to his father, Stu, as a "powerful moment", and that the relationship with his father "took a different direction from that point on."&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; Hart considered the medals to be one of his most prized possessions.&lt;ref name="Historical Dictionary of Wrestling"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=John Grasso|title=Historical Dictionary of Wrestling|publisher=Scarecrow Press, inc.|year=2014|isbn = 978-0-8108-7926-3|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1977, Hart was [[Collegiate wrestling|collegiate]] champion at [[Mount Royal University|Mount Royal College]], where he was studying filmmaking;&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart, Bret 2007 p. 36"&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; his coaches and other people around him felt that he had shown sufficient promise to compete at the following year's [[Commonwealth Games]] and encouraged him to begin training for the event. Hart, however, was beginning to find amateur wrestling unrewarding amid injuries and [[Scholastic wrestling#Unhealthy weight loss|fluctuating weight]].&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stu still believed his son capable of making it to the Olympic or Commonwealth Games if he put forth the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart has expressed that he believed that even if he became an exceptionally successful sports wrestler it would not have led to a career afterwards which he was interested in, stating that he thought that he would end up as a wrestling coach or phys-ed teacher at a high-school if he pursued the olympic route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2000|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart felt that the only way to give up amateur wrestling without disappointing his father was to become a professional wrestler. His college grades became poorer as his interest in filmmaking waned; he dedicated himself to professional wrestling and began training with his father's [[Stampede Wrestling]] promotion.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; Hart has spoken of how helpful his amateur background was in his professional wrestling career, and also of what a positive effect amateur wrestling has on junior high school and high school-aged boys in terms of building self-confidence.&lt;ref name="slam"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hart, Bret|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBretHart/010127-sun.html|title=Special Memories|via=Canoe.com|publisher=|date=January 27, 2001|accessdate=2010-08-07|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130120202935/http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingBretHart/010127-sun.html|archivedate=January 20, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Stampede Wrestling (1976–1984) ===
In 1976, Hart began working for his father's [[Stampede Wrestling]] promotion in Calgary. Hart first began helping the promotion by refereeing matches.&lt;ref name="debut"/&gt; At a 1978 event in [[Saskatoon]], Saskatchewan, a wrestler was unable to perform his match, forcing Stu to ask his son to stand in as a replacement. Before long, he became a regular contender, eventually partnering with brother [[Keith Hart (wrestler)|Keith]] to win the Stampede International Tag Team Championship four times.

Hart gained some of his most prominent experience with Japanese combatants and real-life trainers [[Mr. Hito]] and [[Kazuo Sakurada|Mr. Sakurada]]. Hart also had high-impact matches against Tom Billington, the [[Dynamite Kid]]. In the midst of wrestling alongside his family, Hart made a point not to [[Nepotism|ride on the shoulders of his elders]]. Hart faithfully [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobbed]] as requested of him, taking pride in the believability of his performances. As he said himself, "No one could take a shit kicking like Bret Hart".&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; Although he dreaded partaking in interviews and speaking in front of a crowd, Hart went on to win the promotion's top titles, including two British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championships, five International Tag Team Championships, and six North American Heavyweight Championships. Hart also wrestled [[Satoru Sayama|Tiger Mask]] in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW), a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promotion|promotion]] for whom he often wrestled during the early to mid-1980s. He remained one of Stampede's most successful performers until the promotion, along with several wrestlers, was acquired by the [[History of WWE#World Wrestling Federation|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in August 1984.

==== Early tenure and The Hart Foundation (1984–1991) ====
{{main|The Hart Foundation}}
[[File:The Hart Foundation Tag Team.jpg|thumb|right|Hart (left) with [[Jim Neidhart]] behind him as [[The Hart Foundation]]]]
Hart was asked to start out in the WWF as a singles wrestler with a [[cowboy]] [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] but refused, stating that where he comes from "if you called yourself a cowboy, you'd better be one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his televised WWF debut on August 29, 1984, in a [[Professional wrestling match types|tag team match]] where he teamed with the [[Dynamite Kid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/84.htm|title=WWF @ Brantford, Ontario – August 29, 1984|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, in [[Poughkeepsie, New York]], Hart defeated [[Aldo Ortiz|Aldo Marino]] in his televised debut singles match, which aired on the September 29 edition of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]''. In 1985, after acquiring the nickname of "Hit Man",&lt;ref name="wwebio"/&gt; he requested to join [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], [[The Hart Foundation#The Hart Foundation|The Hart Foundation]], which included brother-in-law [[Jim Neidhart]]. Bret began to increasingly team with Neidhart,&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; in order to build the promotion's tag team division. The "Hart Foundation" name then became exclusive to Bret, Neidhart and manager Jimmy Hart, due to the similar family names of both team members and their manager.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/hart-foundation-original.html|title=Hart Foundation Profile|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bret's agile, technical style – which earned him the moniker "The Excellence of Execution" (coined by [[Gorilla Monsoon]])&lt;ref name="wwebio"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''WWE Byte This'' interview (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; – created a contrast with his partner Neidhart's strength and brawling skills. During this time, Hart began wearing his signature&lt;ref name="glasses"&gt;{{cite web|author=Zeigler, Zack|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/08202007/articles/trevorshat|title=Hats off to Trevor Murdoch|publisher=WWE|date=August 21, 2007|accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sunglasses]], initially to conceal his nervousness during [[Promos (professional wrestling)|promos]]. Hart considers his microphone work to have been a weakness throughout his early career.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pwtorchbyte"/&gt;

In 1986, Hart began his first singles program with [[Ricky Steamboat]], and in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Singles match|singles match]] originally planned for [[WrestleMania 2]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; he lost to Steamboat at the [[Boston Garden]] on March 8, 1986, which would be included on Hart's 2005 DVD as one of his all-time favorite matches.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; At WrestleMania 2, Hart instead participated in a [[Professional wrestling battle royal|20-man battle royal]] which was eventually won by [[André the Giant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results|title=WrestleMania 2 Official Results|accessdate=2008-10-29|publisher=WWE|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210055536/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/|archivedate=December 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost to Steamboat again on the July 28, 1986 edition of ''[[WWF Prime Time Wrestling|Prime Time Wrestling]]''.&lt;ref name="prime"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wwf/wwfprimetime.htm|title=''WWF Prime Time Wrestling'' results|work=Wrestling Information Archive|accessdate=2012-09-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104003624/http://www.100megsfree4.com/wiawrestling/pages/wwf/wwfprimetime.htm|archivedate=January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart headlined his first televised WWF card when he beat [[Raymond Rougeau|Ray Rougeau]], of [[The Fabulous Rougeaus]], in the main event of the November 3, 1986 edition of ''Prime Time Wrestling''.&lt;ref name="prime"/&gt;

The Hart Foundation won their first of two [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championship]] on the February 7, 1987 edition of ''Superstars of Wrestling'' when they defeated [[The British Bulldogs]]. They then teamed with [[Daniel Briley|Danny Davis]] to face The British Bulldogs and [[Tito Santana]] at [[WrestleMania III]].

The Hart Foundation adopted the nickname, "The Pink and Black Attack", which Hart continued to use after the [[tag team]]'s disbandment. This was in reference to the team's ring attire, as well as Hart's signature mirrored sunglasses, which he would routinely give away to a young audience member before matches, following his [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] in 1988.&lt;ref name="glasses"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12282009/|title=''Raw'' results, December 28, 2009|work=[[WWE]]|first=Greg|last=Adkins|accessdate=2010-02-01|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109114326/http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/12282009/|archivedate=January 9, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Hart's WWF career progressed, he increasingly described himself as "The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be" (derived from the 1984 film ''[[The Natural (film)|The Natural]]''), which he would later justify through three claims: he never injured an opponent through any fault of his own; through the entire course of his career, he missed only one show (as a result of flight difficulties); and that he only once refused to lose a match – his final WWF match with long-time adversary Shawn Michaels at the [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] event in 1997, which culminated in the [[Montreal Screwjob]].&lt;ref name="brethartonflair"&gt;{{cite web|author=Hart, Bret|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/columns/news/brethartonflair.html|title=Bret "Hitman" Hart Responds to Ric Flair's Book|quote=When I boast about being the best there is, it is because of three reasons...|publisher=Calgary Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hart Foundation lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to [[Strike Force (professional wrestling)|Strike Force]] on the October 27 edition of ''Superstars of Wrestling''.

When Bret appeared to have the match won, with Yokozuna locked in the sharpshooter, Owen came to ringside to congratulate his brother. The referee began questioning Owen's motives, which allowed Fuji to assault Bret. Owen then involved himself in the match, resulting in a victory for Yokozuna via disqualification. On the [[House show|non-televised]] but now-[[Canon (fiction)|canon]] November 22 edition of ''Monday Night Raw'', Hart again challenged Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and again failed to regain the championship due to similar involvement from Owen.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} The brothers' disagreements set the wheels in motion for a family feud that would span the entirety of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|WWF Superstars]]''.

Hart continued to feud with his brother Owen while he also started feuding with [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]. Hart's friend and former tag team partner Jim Neidhart returned to the WWF and reunited with Hart. At [[King of the Ring (1994)|King of the Ring]], Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Diesel. When Hart was winning the match, Shawn Michaels interfered on Diesel's behalf; Diesel appeared close to victory after he delivered a [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife Powerbomb]] yet before he could pin Hart, Neidhart interfered, therefore Diesel won by disqualification, but Hart retained his title. Neidhart left when Diesel and Michaels attacked Hart following the match.

Over the summer, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]], who was fresh from winning the [[King of the Ring (1996)|1996 King of the Ring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwwew.net/ppv/wwf/june/1996.htm|title=King of the Ring 1996|publisher=pwwew.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; continually taunted Hart and challenged him to come back and have a match.

The building tension between Hart and Michaels climaxed after the match, when Hart assaulted Michaels. Hart's feud with Austin escalated at the [[Royal Rumble (1997)]], when Hart tossed Austin out of the ring, only for Austin (unbeknownst to the referees) to climb back into the ring and win the Rumble, while the referees were distracted by [[Mick Foley|Mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/1988114111/results|title=1997 Royal Rumble results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart quit the WWF the next night on ''Raw'' in protest.

At WrestleMania 13, Hart and Austin had their rematch in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|submission match]] that would later get a 5-star rating from [[Dave Meltzer]]. In the end, Hart locked the Sharpshooter on a bloody Austin, who refused to give up. In fact, Austin never quit, but passed out from the blood loss and pain. [[Ken Shamrock]], the special guest referee, awarded Hart the match, after which he continued to assault Austin, thus turning heel for the first time since 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/13/results|title=WrestleMania 13 official results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named "[[List of Wrestling Observer Newsletter awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]]" by ''Wrestling Observer Newsletter'' and voted "[[List of Pro Wrestling Illustrated awards#Match of the Year|Match of the Year]]" by ''Pro Wrestling Illustrated'' readers.&lt;ref name=MOTY/&gt; Later that night, Hart confronted Sycho Sid and The Undertaker prior to their match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship; Hart insulted Undertaker and told Shawn Michaels (who was a guest commentator for the match) not to interfere. Undertaker won the match, which ended with Hart hotshotting Sid on the ropes, therefore costing him the title.

Hart challenged [[Dwayne Johnson|Rocky Maivia]] for the Intercontinental Championship in the main event of the March 31 edition of ''Raw''. Rocky Maivia won by disqualification when Hart refused to release a figure-four leglock applied around the ringpost. He faced Austin again in the main event of [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker]], to determine who would challenge the WWF World Heavyweight Champion in a title match at the following month's [[In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell]]. Austin had Hart locked in his own finishing move, the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], in the middle of the ring when [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]] interfered on Hart's behalf, resulting in disqualification and giving Austin the victory and title match. They met once again in a street fight on the April 21 edition of ''Raw Is War'', in which Austin injured Hart's ankle with a steel chair. The match was ruled a no contest and Austin afterward continued to beat Hart while on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance.

==== Departure and the Montreal Screwjob (1997) ====
{{main||Montreal Screwjob|Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows}}
[[File:WWF Champion Bret Hart.jpg|thumb|left|Hart (along with [[Hulk Hogan]]) held the record for most [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] reigns until [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]'s sixth reign in 2001]]
Around this time, Hart's on-air rivalry with Vince McMahon also escalated. A heated ringside altercation between the two led many fans to dislike McMahon, who at the time was being exposed as owner of the WWF more and more frequently on-air. Although Hart had signed a 20-year contract back in 1996, the WWF was in a rough financial position by late 1997 and could no longer afford to honor the contract. Although Hart was arguably the biggest wrestler in the world during the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="darkdays"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/theirdarkdays/|title=Their Dark Days: How can you be so Hart-less?|work=[[WWE]]|first=James|last=Vermillion|accessdate=2009-12-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015044627/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/theirdarkdays/|archivedate=October 15, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon also felt that the value of his character was beginning to wane,&lt;ref&gt;''Off The Record'' with Vince McMahon, [[The Sports Network|TSN]], 2–24–98: "...his value was beginning to wane..."

This was despite Hart's reluctance to leave the WWF and willingness to re-negotiate.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jay 1998, [[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hart subsequently signed a three-year contract with WCW. His final match with the WWF would be a title match against his real life rival Shawn Michaels at [[Survivor Series (1997)|Survivor Series]] in Montreal. Hart did not want to end his WWF career with a loss to Michaels in his home country particularly with the context of their nationality-fueled feud; and offered to lose, forfeit or otherwise give over the belt to Michaels in any other way that McMahon wanted. McMahon agreed to Hart's idea of forfeiting the championship the next night on ''Raw Is War'' or losing it a few weeks later.

Although Hart stated to McMahon he would not take the WWF World Heavyweight Championship with him to WCW TV and despite insistence from then-WCW President [[Eric Bischoff]],&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt; that Hart would join WCW with a "clean slate", McMahon was still concerned and paranoid; this led to him breaking his word in what eventually came to be known as the [[Montreal Screwjob]]. Even though Hart did not submit to the Sharpshooter, referee [[Earl Hebner]] called for the bell as if he had, on McMahon's orders. This resulted in Hart "losing" the title to Michaels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1997/mainevent|title=Survivor Series 1997 main event (Montreal Screwjob)|publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The night ended with an irate Hart spitting in McMahon's face, destroying television equipment, and punching McMahon backstage in front of [[Gerald Brisco]], [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]], and McMahon's son [[Shane McMahon|Shane]]. Hart also confronted Michaels backstage about the match finish. Many behind-the-scenes events leading up to the Montreal Screwjob were filmed for the documentary ''[[Hitman Hart: Wrestling with Shadows]]'', released in 1998. WWE has described the Montreal Screwjob as "arguably the most controversial, most jarring moment in the annals of sports entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tello, Craig|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/harttenyearslaterpt1|title=The Hit Man: Ten years later – Part One|publisher=WWE|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=December 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart subsequently asked the fans for forgiveness, turning his back on Hogan and the nWo. A match between Hart and Hogan was booked for the September 28 edition of ''Nitro''. During the match, Hart sustained a knee injury, with the bout ending in a no-contest; [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] came to Hart's aid and initiated a match with Hogan. Hart turned on Sting, delivering a DDT, and this bout was also ruled a no-contest. Sting, a member of the rival [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|nWo Wolfpac]], was assaulted after the match; this betrayal began an intense feud between Hart and Sting.

Finally, he called out "franchise player" [[Bill Goldberg]], claiming he could beat him in five minutes and verbally coercing Goldberg into giving him the spear. Hart was wearing a metal [[breastplate]] under his [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] jersey, which resulted in Goldberg being knocked out. Hart then counted his own [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] over Goldberg's unconscious body and announced over the mic: "Hey Bischoff, and the WCW, I quit!" In reality, he had suffered a [[groin]] injury at the hands of [[Dean Malenko]] in November and needed time off for surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|pp=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart took a further four months off from WCW to be with his family.

Out of respect for Goldberg, Hart vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the December 20 episode of ''Nitro'' and suggested that he, without the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Championship advantage|championship advantage]], face Goldberg that night to determine the true champion. During the match, [[Scott Hall]] and [[Kevin Nash]] came to the ring looking to attack Goldberg with baseball bats. Hart convinced them to stop, then hit Goldberg with one of the bats.

WCW terminated Hart's contract via FedEx letter on October 20, 2000, due to his ongoing incapacity, and he announced his retirement from professional wrestling soon afterward.&lt;ref name="retirement"/&gt;

Hart and several critics considered his storylines during his tenure to be lacklustre.&lt;ref name="DVD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bischoff, Eric: ''Controversy Creates Cash'', [[WWE Books]], 2006 (p.265)&lt;/ref&gt; Former WCW wrestler [[Chris Jericho]] attributed this to backstage politics and creative mayhem.&lt;ref name="MondayNightWars01-6"/&gt; Hart cited his "steel plate" segment with Goldberg and his tribute match to Owen, against Chris Benoit, as his two worthwhile moments with the company.

On February 1, 2016, Hart announced through a [[Facebook]] post that he had been diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f4wonline.com/other-wrestling/bret-hart-reveals-he-has-prostate-cancer-makes-statement-206751 |title=Bret Hart reveals he has prostate cancer, makes statement |date=February 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 1, 2016 |work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202014959/http://www.f4wonline.com/other-wrestling/bret-hart-reveals-he-has-prostate-cancer-makes-statement-206751 |archivedate=February 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Ross claimed on March 2, 2016 that Hart had beaten the disease following successful surgery and that it appeared not to have spread to other areas of his body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/35714206/wwes-bret-the-hitman-hart-beats-prostate-cancer-after-having-surgery|title=WWE's Bret 'the Hitman' Hart beats prostate cancer after having surgery|work=[[BBC Newsbeat]]|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart responded to Jim Ross' comments through Facebook saying that although the surgery was a success and that he and his doctors were optimistic, he would continue to be monitored every three months by doctors until he can actually be cancer free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/bret-hart-hitman-prostate-cancer-recovery-1.3480166|title=Bret 'The Hitman' Hart, pro wrestler, hopeful about cancer recovery|work=[[CBC.ca]]|date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal issues with Ric Flair ===
In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview in which he said [[Ric Flair]] "sucks", and described his workplace, WCW, as "minor league".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Oliver, Sean (director)|year=2014|title=Timeline: History of WCW – 93 – Told by Vader|medium=DVD|publisher=Kayfabe Commentaries|quote=1993 – October – Bret Hart buries Ric Flair and WCW – Bret Hart was on Toronto all-sports radio station 'The FAN' and buried WCW and Ric Flair during an interview, saying WCW is 'minor league' and Flair 'sucks'.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography, Flair accused Hart of exploiting the death of his brother, [[Owen Hart]], and the controversy surrounding the [[Montreal Screwjob]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=887C21B7-3048-52EA-1E34C39B8C6042BE|title=Flair Pulls No Punches in Book|author=Mike Mooneyham|date=July 4, 2004|accessdate=2007-05-14|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224923/http://www.mikemooneyham.com/pages/viewfull.cfm?ObjectID=887C21B7-3048-52EA-1E34C39B8C6042BE &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flair also claimed in his autobiography that, despite Hart's popularity in Canada, he was not a formidable money-making [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#D|draw]] in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as "plain ridiculous" in a column written for the ''[[Calgary Sun]]''.&lt;ref name="brethartonflair"/&gt; Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold-out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers [[Mick Foley]] and [[Randy Savage]]. Hart did acknowledge a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he, and others, felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well-publicised sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWF stars.&lt;ref name="brethartonflair"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/wwf-aims-shoots-high-wrestling-garden-roll-article-1.803878|title=Wwf Aims Low, Shoots High Wrestling Comes to the Garden on a Roll|publisher=Nydailynews.com|date=December 27, 1998|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/World-Wrestling-Federation-Entertainment-Inc-Company-History.html|title=World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. – Company History|publisher=Fundinguniverse.com|accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hart also took aim at Flair in his autobiography, criticizing his in-ring talents and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle [[Blading (professional wrestling)|blading]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Hart, Bret|2007|pp=286; 303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flair and Hart have since reconciled and are now friends.&lt;ref&gt;Flair, Ric; Bret Hart, ''WOOOOO! Nation with Ric Flair'', "Episode 3: Bret "The Hitman" Hart", [[CBS Local Media]], 2015-05-19&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4674">The '''British Record Society''' is a British [[learned society]] that focuses on publishing [[archive|historic records]], or, more specifically, [[Index (publishing)|indexes]] to such records. In recent years, the Society has concentrated on the publication of name indexes to English [[probate]] records, and the texts of 17th-century [[Hearth Tax]] returns.

==Foundation and early history==
The Society was founded in 1889 to take over the [[Index Library]], which had begun life the previous year as [[William Phillimore Watts Phillimore|W.P.W. Phillimore's]] private scheme for the publication of indexes to British public records, which is now the brief of the List and Index Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listandindexsociety.org.uk |title=serving the historical community |publisher=List and Index Society |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society was also always interested in record conservation, and to act as what would now be called a pressure group for [[archive]]s and their users, pushing for the creation of county record offices and county record societies. The inception of an official series of Lists and Indexes in 1892 reduced the need for private publication of indexes to records in the [[Public Record Office]]. The Society consequently turned its attention to records held in other repositories.

In 1898 the Society’s Scottish section became the totally independent [[Scottish Record Society]]. In 1933 the Society’s Record Preservation Section similarly took off to become the germ of the [[British Records Association]] (B.R.A).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishrecordsassociation.org.uk |title=British Records Association |publisher=British Records Association |date=2012-05-12 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Since the 1930s, the British Record Society has been primarily a publishing society for English records, frequently in conjunction with county historical societies. By 2012, 126 volumes of the Index Library had been published over 123 years, besides two extra volumes and some microfiche. Over the past half century the Society has largely, but not exclusively, concentrated on the publication of name indexes to [[probate]] records, and the texts of [[Hearth Tax]] returns from the 1660s and 1670s.

A longer history of the Society and its current activities will be found on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishrecordsociety.org |title=contact |publisher=Britishrecordsociety.org |date=2011-02-17 |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete list of its publications up to 1982 will be found in E.L.C. Mullins, ''Texts and Calendars'', I and II, Royal Historical Society, 1958 and 1983. Details of those published after 1982 can be found on the [[Royal Historical Society]]'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/textandcalendars.htm |title=(RHS) |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614165832/http://www.royalhistoricalsociety.org/textandcalendars.htm |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Buyer credit''' is a short  term [[Credit (finance)|credit]] available to an [[Importer|importer (buyer)]] from overseas lenders such as [[bank]]s and other [[financial institution]] for goods they are importing. The overseas banks usually lend the importer (buyer) based on the [[letter of comfort]] (a bank guarantee) issued by the importer's bank. For this service the importer's bank or buyer's credit consultant charges a fee called an arrangement fee.

Buyer's credit helps local importers gain access to cheaper foreign funds  that may be closer to [[London Interbank Offered Rate|LIBOR]] rates as against local sources of funding which are more costly.

The duration of buyer's credit may vary from country to country, as per the local regulations. For example, in India, buyer's credit can be availed for one year in case the import is for tradeable goods and for three years if the import is for capital goods.

== Benefits to importer ==
Buyer's credit has several advantages for the importer.
The exporter gets paid on due date; whereas importer gets extended date for making an import payment as per the cash flows.
The importer can deal with exporter on sight basis, negotiate a better discount and use the buyers credit route to avail financing.
The funding currency can be depending on the choice of the customer and availability of LIBOR rates in the exchange market.  
The importer can use this financing for any form of payment mode, such as: open account, collections, or LCs.

== Steps involved  ==
# The customer requests the Buyer's Credit Arranger to arrange the credit before the due date of the bill 
# Arrange to request overseas bank branches to provide a buyer's credit offer letter in the name of the importer. Best rate of interest is quoted to the importer
# Overseas bank to fund Importer's bank [[Nostro and vostro accounts|Nostro account]] for the required amount
# Importer's bank to make import bill payment by utilizing the amount credited (if the borrowing currency is different from the currency of Imports then a cross currency contract is utilized to effect the import payment)
# Importer's bank will recover the required amount from the importer and remit the same to overseas bank on due date.
# It helps importer in working capital management.

== Cost involved ==
Interest cost is charged by overseas bank as a financing cost.

== Risk involved ==
Buyer's credit is associated with [[currency risk]].
Thus, [[Hedge (finance)|Hedging]] may be required as foreign currency is involved, making Buyer's Credit risky at times.

== Indian regulatory framework ==
Banks can provide buyer’s credit up to US$20 million (US$ 2 crore) per import transactions for a maximum maturity period of one year from date of shipment. In case of import of capital goods, banks can approve buyer’s credits up to $20 million per transaction with a maturity period of up to three years. No rollover beyond that period is permitted.

As per RBI directives dated 11.07.13, at the time of availment of trade credit, the period of trade credit should be linked to the operating cycle and trade transaction. AD banks need to  ensure that these instructions are strictly complied with.

RBI has issued directions under Sec 10(4) and Sec 11(1) of the [[Foreign Exchange Management Act]], 1999, stating that authorized dealers may approve proposals received (in Form ECB) for short-term credit for financing—by way of either suppliers' credit or buyers' credit—of import of goods into India, based on uniform criteria. Credit is to be extended for a period of less than three years; amount of credit should not exceed $20 million, per import transaction; the `all-in-cost' per annum, payable for the credit is not to exceed 6 months LIBOR + 350 basis points for credit up to one year, and LIBOR + 125 basis points for credits for periods beyond one year but less than three years, for the currency of credit.

All applications for short-term credit exceeding $20 million for any import transaction are to be forwarded to the Chief General Manager, Exchange Control Department, [[Reserve Bank of India]], Central Office, External Commercial Borrowing (ECB) Division, Mumbai. Each credit has to be given `a unique identification number' by authorised dealers and the number so allotted should be quoted in all references. The International Banking Division of the authorised dealer is required to furnish the details of approvals granted by all its branches, during the month, in Form ECB-ST to the RBI, so as to reach not later than 5th of the following month. (Circular AP (DIR Series) No 24 dated September 27, 2002.

As per RBI Master circular on External Commercial Borrowing and Trade Finance 1 July 2011, the all-in cost ceiling for interest is now six month L + 200 {{Not a typo|bps}}(bps is Basis Points  . A unit that is equal to 1/100th of 1%) for buyer's credit arrange for tenure up to three years. All cost ceiling includes arranger fee, upfront fee, management fee, handling and processing charges, out-of-pocket and legal expenses, if any.

The above ceiling got revised on 15/11/2011 to 6 Month Libor + 350 {{Not a typo|bps}} and got further extended on 30/03/2012 till 30/09/2012. From 01-10-2012 Maximum cap of 6 Month Libor + 350 bsp has been extended till further review.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">The '''''Chronicle of Ioannina''''' is a [[prose]] [[chronicle]] written in Greek about the history of [[Ioannina]] during the rule of [[Thomas Preljubović]], the Serb [[Despot of Epirus]], who was based in Ioannina in the second half of the 14th century.

The ''Chronicle'' was first attributed to the monks Proklos and Komnenos, and was therefore initially known as the ''Chronicle of Proklos and Komnenos''. The ''Chronicle'' is deeply prejudiced&lt;ref name="Nicol1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nicol|first=Donald MacGillivray|authorlink=Donald MacGillivray Nicol|title=The Despotate of Epiros, 1267-1479: A Contribution to the History of Greece in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XIj0FfKto9AC&amp;pg=PA143|year=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-26190-6|page=143|quote= The Chronicle of Ioannina is deeply prejudiced against Thomas Preljubovic.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hostile against Preljubović.&lt;ref name="EllisKlusáková2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Steven G.|last2=Klusáková|first2=Lud'a|title=Imagining Frontiers, Contesting Identities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3zXFCs9EfEYC&amp;pg=PA149|year=2007|publisher=Edizioni Plus|isbn=978-88-8492-466-7|page=139|quote=...the Chronicle of Ioannina, hostile to Thomas Preljubovic...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It portrays Thomas Preljubović as a ruthless and despotic tyrant, while his wife [[Maria Angelina Doukaina Palaiologina]] is described with more flattering words.

The ''Chronicle of Ioannina'' is an invaluable source of information on the history of the [[Epirus]] region during the late [[Middle Ages]]. Among other information, it mentions a naval landing in [[Lake Pamvotis]] on February 26, 1379, by Albanian, Bulgarian and Vlach raiders.

==Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden (Hirshhorn) ==
Within the conservation lab at the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]], specialized activities for the treatment and care of paintings, sculpture, works on paper, and time-based media are performed. As an aid in treatment and to better understand the artist’s creative methods and materials, conservators closely examine works of art using a variety of technical tools, including stereo-binocular microscopes and ultraviolet light. Conservators also use an array of analytical methods to identify under-drawings, pigments, binding media, and coating materials. All treatments involve collaboration with curators, and frequently scientists, to determine the condition of a work of art, guide treatment decisions, and examine the artist’s working methods and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conservation - Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|url = http://hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/conservation/#collection=conservation&amp;detail=http%253A//hirshhorn.si.edu/bio/conservation-department/&amp;title=Conservation+Department|website = Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden {{!}} Smithsonian|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Allen Hodge''' (born May 13, 1932) is a retired American wrestler and boxer. He is renowned for his wrestling career, both [[Amateur wrestling|amateur]] and [[Professional wrestling|professional]]. He was born and raised in [[Perry, Oklahoma]], where he continues to live. He is famous for the ability to crush apples with one hand,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://okgazette.com/2013/05/14/attempting-a-reversal |title=Attempting a reversal: Oklahoma’s wrestling greats grapple with the International Olympics Committee to return the sport to the games. |date=May 15, 2013 |last=Fairley |first=Tim |accessdate=May 19, 2013 |work=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; a feat which he demonstrated live on [[ESPN]] during the [[2006 NCAA Wrestling Championships]]. He said his strength was due to having double tendons in his hands.

==Amateur wrestling career==
At Perry High School in Oklahoma, Hodge won the 165-pound title at the state tournament in 1951. As a [[Collegiate wrestling|collegiate wrestler]] for the [[University of Oklahoma]], Hodge was undefeated at 46-0, with 36 pins and reportedly was never taken off his feet during his collegiate career. He was a three-time Big Seven conference champ at 177 pounds (1955–1957), and won the 177-pound title at the NCAA championships those same three years, pinning all three of his finals opponents. (Hodge is only one of two three-time NCAA Division I champs to have done that, the other being Oklahoma A&amp;M's Earl McCready in 1928–1930.) He is the only amateur wrestler to be on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]] as an amateur wrestler.  He worked as a [[professional wrestler]] for eighteen years, and was a 5-time USA Tag Team Champion, with [[Skandor Akbar]], among others.

His reputation as a high school wrestler preceded him when he joined the US Navy in 1951. At Ames, Iowa, in April 1952, Hodge survived the US Olympic Trials, and was coached by Naval Academy Instructor Ray Swartz in the 174-pound division.&lt;ref name=p224&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 224, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Helsinki Olympics, Hodge was defeated by [[USSR]]'s David Cimakuridze. Going into May 1956 wrestling trials for US Olympic team, Hodge was middleweight favorite. He was eliminated on May 2 by William Smith. Smith was embroiled in controversy with the Central AAU and Hodge was his substitute.&lt;ref name=p224 /&gt; After two [[Olympics]] appearances, Hodge placed 5th in 1952, and won the [[Silver Medal]] in 1956, in [[Melbourne, Australia]] after being defeated at the final by [[Bulgaria]]n [[Nikola Stanchev]].

The [[Dan Hodge Trophy]], named after him, is the amateur wrestling equivalent of the [[Heisman Trophy]].

==Professional wrestling career==
Trained by [[Leroy McGuirk]] and [[Ed Lewis (wrestler)|Ed "Strangler" Lewis]], Hodge made his debut as a professional wrestler in October 1959.&lt;ref name=p224 /&gt; Hodge's first major feud was with [[National Wrestling Alliance]] Junior Heavyweight Champion [[Angelo Savoldi]]. Hodge's rivalry with Savoldi led to a bizarre event. Hodge's father entered the ring during a boxing match on May 27, 1960, between Hodge and Savoldi, and stabbed Savoldi with a penknife.&lt;ref name=p224 /&gt; Savoldi required 70 stitches at a local hospital, while Hodge's father was arrested.&lt;ref name=p225&gt;National Wrestling Alliance, The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling, p. 225, Tim Hornbaker, ECW Press, 2007, {{ISBN|1-55022-741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 22, 1960, Hodge defeated Savoldi for the [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship]] at the Stockyards Coliseum in Oklahoma City. Hodge became McGuirk's principal headliner, and by 1962, Hodge was making upwards of $80,000 a year.&lt;ref name=p225 /&gt;

Hodge was a perennial NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion, holding the title eight times for a total of over ten years, longer than anyone else. In 2007, Hodge was inducted into the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]]. Hodge has made appearances in [[WWE]] on ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' in 2005 and 2012 in which he honored fellow Oklahoma wrestling native [[Jim Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/36192-wwe-posts-video-of-jim-ross-appreciation-night |title=WWE posts video of Jim Ross Appreciation Night |last=Martin |first=Adam |date=October 1, 2012 |publisher=WrestleView |accessdate=October 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WWE Hall of Fame]]r and seven-time world champion [[Bret Hart]] has referred to Hodge as "one of the greatest wrestlers in pro wrestling or amateur wrestling there’s ever been",&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"&gt;http://www.baltimoresun.com/bs-mtblog-2008-07-transcript_of_bret_harts_hall_of_fame_speech-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; and described being in the same room as Hodge at the 2008 [[National Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]]'s award ceremony as "a big, big honor for me".&lt;ref name="baltimoresun.com"/&gt;

==Boxing career==
Danny won the 1958 Chicago Golden Gloves at Heavyweight, then won a Chicago-NY Intercity bout in October, beating Charley Hood. He finished his amateur career with 17 wins, no losses and 12 KO's. Convinced by boxing manager Art Freeman that he was a better prospect than [[Rocky Marciano]], Hodge decided to become a professional boxer rather than pursue the opportunity to compete as a boxer and a wrestler at the [[1960 Summer Olympics]] in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name=p224 /&gt; In his professional boxing debut, he scored a first-round knockout victory over Norm Jackson.&lt;ref name=p224 /&gt; As a professional, he had a reported record of 8-2, although only 7 wins have been documented.  He retired on July 9, 1959.&lt;ref name=p224 /&gt;

==Other==
On March 29, 2005, Hodge was honored by [[Oklahoma]] state lawmakers as an "Oklahoma Sports Hero".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20090510/ARCHIVES/305109918 |title=Hodge has lived the American dream |last=Mooneyham |first=Mike |date=May 10, 2009 |publisher=The Post and Courier |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He serves as chairman of the Oklahoma Professional Boxing Commission, which regulates professional boxing, wrestling, and mixed martial arts in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ok.gov/osac/Oklahoma_State_Athletic_Commission/Commissioners/index.html |title=Oklahoma State Athletic Commission- Commissioners |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The records are unclear as to where two of Hodge's eight NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship reigns began. The records are also unclear as to which NWA affiliated promotion or promotions Hodge wrestled for when he won the championship on those two occasions.&lt;/small&gt;

'''''Dead Tired''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Grosse Fatigue'''}}) is a 1994 French [[comedy film]] directed by [[Michel Blanc]]. It was entered into the [[1994 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2970/year/1994.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Grosse Fatigue |accessdate=26 August 2009 |work=festival-cannes.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822170809/http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2970/year/1994.html |archivedate=22 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Michel Blanc is a great film actor. However, he's been accused of sexually abusing actresses Josiane Balasko, Charlotte Gainsbourg and Mathilda May, of behaving like a cad at Cannes and of accepting dubious publicity deals, such as appearances in supermarkets, behind the back of his agent. The evidence is there for everyone to see, but Blanc knows he is innocent. He seeks assistance from fellow actress Carole Bouquet to shed light on this matter, and he discovers that he has a perfect double, Patrick Olivier, who, having suffered all his life from his likeness to Michel Blanc, has decided to use this to his financial advantage.

The '''Dering Roll'''&lt;ref&gt;British Library Digitised Manuscripts, ref. [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/FullDisplay.aspx?ref=Add_Roll_77720 Add. Roll 77720].&lt;/ref&gt; is the oldest English [[roll of arms]] surviving in its original form. It was made between 1270 and 1280 and contains the [[coat of arms]] of 324 knights, starting with two illegitimate children of [[John, King of England|King John]]. [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]]&lt;ref&gt;S.P. Salt, 'Dering, Sir Edward, first Baronet (1598-1644)', ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/7/101007531/ Online Edition (2008)], subscription needed).&lt;/ref&gt; acquired the roll during the 17th century and modified it to include a fictitious ancestor of his own.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Wagner, ''English Genealogy'' (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1960), p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually purchased by the [[British Library]] (as Add Roll 77720) following fund raising involving a number of other charities and individuals.

Glover's Roll, made in 1586, is a copy of a now lost roll dating from even earlier, from the reign of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] (1216–1272).&lt;ref&gt;[[James Planché|Planché, J.R.]], ''The Pursuivant of Arms; or Heraldry Founded on Facts'', London, 1873, p.30: "Our earliest heraldic information is derived, at present (1852), from a copy made in 1586 by Glover, [[Somerset Herald]], of a roll of arms of the reign of Henry III"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Dering Roll depicts the coats of arms of around a quarter of the English [[baronage]] during the era of [[Edward I of England|Edward I]].&lt;ref name=artfund&gt;{{cite web|title=The Dering Roll|url=http://www.artfund.org/artwork/10300/the-dering-roll|publisher=Artfund|accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis was given to knights from [[Sussex]] and [[Kent]],&lt;ref name=artfund/&gt; as it was produced in [[Dover]] between 1270 and 1280 and the document was designed to list the knights who owed [[feudal]] service there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harrison|first=John|title=Riding to rescue vital record of English medieval knights|url=http://www.mla.gov.uk/news_and_views/press_releases/2008/English-medieval-knights|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Museums, Libraries &amp; Archives|date=20 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette&gt;{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Stephanie|title=British Library wins unique key to medieval English heraldry|url=http://www.antiquestradegazette.com/news/6858.aspx|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Antiques Trade Gazette|date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts 324 [[coats of arms]],&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24&gt;{{cite news|title=British Library Acquires Dering Roll - A Who's Who Of Medieval Arms|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history+%26+heritage/time/medieval+britain/art60428|accessdate=22 May 2011|newspaper=Culture 24|date=2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with [[Richard Fitz Roy]] and [[William de Say]], two of [[John, King of England|King John]]'s illegitimate sons.&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; The shields are arranged in 54 rows, with six shields on each line. Above each shield reads the knight's name, except in six cases where it has been omitted or removed.&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; [[Stephen de Pencester]] may have commissioned the roll during his time as [[Constable of Dover Castle]].&lt;ref name=antiquesgazette /&gt;

==Dering's amendment==
[[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]] acquired the Roll whilst lieutenant of [[Dover Castle]],&lt;ref name=libraryacquires24 /&gt; and made his modification after 1638, removing the coat of arms of [[Nicholas de Crioll]] and inserting his own coat of arms with a fictitious ancestor named Ric[hard] fi[t]z Dering&lt;ref&gt;British Library, Digitized manuscripts viewer, Add Roll 77720, [http://www.bl.uk/manuscripts/Viewer.aspx?ref=add_roll_77720_f001r Image 1], row 11 nos. 1 &amp; 2.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to prove the history of his own family.&lt;ref name=artfund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Greenstreet and C. Russell, 'The "Dering" Roll of Arms (continued)', ''The Reliquary, Quarterly Archaeological Journal and Review'' (ed. Llewellynn Jewitt), XVI (1875-76), pp. 235-40, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TKxDAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA239#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false at p. 239 &amp; note].&lt;/ref&gt; This appears adjacent to the shield for Thomas de Marines (''or a cross engrailed gules'').&lt;ref&gt;W.S. Ellis, 'Early Kentish Armory', ''Archaeologia Cantiana'' XV (1883), [http://www.kentarchaeology.org.uk/Research/Pub/ArchCant/Vol.015%20-%201883/015-01.pdf pp. 1-30], at p. 9 &amp; note.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trail of Richard fitz Dering (built upon sources dependent upon Dering's collections) leads, or was intended to lead, to the manor of Heyton in [[Stanford, Kent]] (where the connection with the family of Marinis was mentioned by [[Edward Hasted]]&lt;ref&gt;E. Hasted, 'Parishes: Stanford', in ''The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent'', Vol. 8 (Canterbury, 1799), [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-kent/vol8/pp63-78 pp. 63-78] (British History Online, accessed 11 October 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;), and exemplified by charters like that in [[Thomas Willement]]'s hands.&lt;ref&gt;T. Willement, ''Heraldic Notices of Canterbury Cathedral with Genealogical and Topographical Notes'' (Harding, Lepard &amp; Co, London 1827), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=I4NPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA106#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 106, no. 351, and note 'k'].&lt;/ref&gt; A descent through a branch of the [[Nicholas Haute|de Haute family]] of Wadenhall, [[Waltham, Kent]] was then indicated, but Sir Edward Dering's constructive approach to genealogy leaves many of the sources bedevilled by doubts of authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;O.D. Harris, 'Lines of Descent: Appropriations of Ancestry in Stone and Parchment', in T. Rist and A. Gordon (eds), ''The arts of remembrance in early modern England: memorial cultures of the post-Reformation" (Routledge, London 2016), pp. 85-104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R.H.

[[File:Museu efemero.jpg|thumb|300px]]

The '''Ephemeral Museum''' is the first [[ephemeral art]] museum in the world.

It is located in ''[[Bairro Alto]]'', in the heart of [[Portugal]]’s capital, [[Lisbon]]. This museum is sponsored by [[Pampero Fundación]] and it is part of the [[Pampero Rum]] campaign, developed by [[Leo Burnett]] Lisboa advertising agency.

The first '''Ephemeral Museum''' of the world, created by [[Leo Burnett]] for the [[Pampero Fundación]], expands its frontiers. After its inauguration in [[Bairro Alto]], new spots have “opened its doors” in São Bento and Amoreiras, where new and classic talents unite to promote the best of national and international street art. It can be seen after January 29.

In July 2008, [[Leo Burnett]] transformed the streets of [[Bairro Alto]] – Lisbon’s bohemian quarter - into a true outdoor museum. The concept fit in perfectly with the [[Lisbon]] streets, known for being the stage for the [[graffiti]] cult and other forms of street art. In these very streets, the Ephemeral Museum is born.

The [[Museum]]’s success was immediate. Soon, and keeping up the same concept, São Bento and Amoreiras were elected as the new sites for the [[Museum]]’s expansion as a dynamic space in constant growth, with the endless ambition of becoming the world’s largest street gallery.  

The idea jump-started when [[Leo Burnett]] set up a marketing plan for [[Pampero Fundación|Pampero]]’s rum, creating a place where everyday street artists could be acknowledged. For this vision to become reality, careful analysis of [[street art]] manifestations had to take place ([[graffiti]], [[stencils]], [[stickers]]) in order to separate true art from vandalism. We identify and catalogue the works (author and title). 
Most importantly, it makes sense to state that this project is in no means an incentive for [[graffiti]] creation and acts of vandalism (which are normally associated to street art), but as a project that aims to draw attention to the need of a space that voices out and exhibits this style of art as an independent form of manifestation from vandalism, similar to the example in the [[Tate Modern]] Museum, in [[London]].

In the new sites located in São Bento and Amoreiras, it is possible to contemplate the work of various generations of artists from all over the world. The galleries renown such artists like Exas, Creyz, Rote, Eko and Mito, Time, Pariz, Youth, From the Cave, Mace, as well as the international Kenor. [[Bairro Alto]] exhibits the works of international artists Dolk and Jef Aerosol, as well as national artists in the making such as Efeito Magenta and O Colectivo Bitmap.

'''European Pressphoto Agency B.V.''' (epa) is an international news [[photo agency]].

[[Image]]s from all parts of the [[world]] covering [[news]], [[politics]], [[sports]], [[business]], [[finance]] as well as [[arts]], [[culture]] and [[entertainment]] are provided by a global network of over 400 professional [[photographer]]s and included in the epa news photo service. The epa picture service is based both on the broad network of epa's staff photographers all over the world and on the daily production of its member agencies, which are all market leaders in their respective countries. All [[photos]] are edited and distributed to clients and partners worldwide by the editorial headquarters in [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]], which is staffed 24 hours daily.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.eu/products-and-services/epa-service&lt;/ref&gt;

== The epa service ==
epa built up a reputation for reliable, independent and unique photo coverage.

The international picture service of epa is used by diverse [[News media|media]] as well as epa's partners and shareholders worldwide. At present epa’s editorial service offers approximately 2,000 new [[image]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.eu/products-and-services&lt;/ref&gt; on an average day.

The service includes photographs in the areas of news, sports, arts, culture and entertainment, economy, human interest, and science.

== The epa archive ==
The epa photo archive dates back to 1997 and has over six million images on stock,&lt;ref name="epa-about"&gt;http://www.epa.eu/about-epa&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of which can be accessed online.

== History ==
epa was founded in 1985 by seven European [[news agencies]]. The agencies, [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] of [[France]], [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau|ANP]] of the [[Netherlands]], [[ANOP]] (now Lusa) of [[Portugal]], [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]] of [[Italy]], [[Belga (news agency)|Belga]] of [[Belgium]], [[Deutsche Presse-Agentur|dpa]] of [[Germany]] and [[EFE]] of [[Spain]] were motivated by what they saw as a lack of alternatives to the Anglo-Saxon picture services offered at the time.

Originally conceived as a vehicle to exchange the pictures of the member agencies’ domestic service; it also included the world service of AFP and other European services and suppliers. It expanded to a more independent entity as [[Eastern Europe]] opened up. The opening of these new markets, along with the war in the former [[Yugoslavia]], led epa to employ its own photographers in those regions. Despite these developments, epa remained under the auspices of their member/owners whom it exclusively served.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.eu/about-epa/history&lt;/ref&gt;

=== epa shareholders and epa going global ===
By 1995 epa had ten members with the additions of Keystone later in 1985, [[Austria Presse Agentur|APA]] of [[Austria]] in 1986, and Lehtikuva of [[Finland]] in 1987. Pressensbild of [[Sweden]] joined in 1997 followed by Scanfoto (later Scanpix Norway) of [[Norway]] and Nordfoto (later Scanpix Denmark) of [[Denmark]] in 1999. [[Polska Agencja Prasowa|pap]] of [[Poland]] joined epa in 2001.

In early 2003 after extensive restructuring and the departure of AFP, epa successfully made its service available to the worldwide market. Later in 2003 Lehtikuva, Scanpix Denmark/Norway and Pressensbild (later Scanpix Sweden) decided not to continue as a [[shareholder]] of epa. However, Scanpix Norway, Sweden and Denmark continued cooperation with epa under the name of [[Scanpix]] Scandinavia.

ANA of [[Greece]] (now [[ANA-MPA]]) joined epa as a shareholder in 2004 followed by mti of [[Hungary]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="epa-about" /&gt;

Today epa has nine shareholders, all being market leaders in their respective countries:

* Athens News Agency-Macedonian Press Agency ([[ANA-MPA]]) in Greece
* [[Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau]] (ANP) in [[the Netherlands]]
* [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata]] (ANSA) in Italy
* [[Austria Presse Agentur]] (APA) in Austria
* Agencia [[EFE]] in Spain
* Keystone in [[Switzerland]]
* [[Lusa news agency|Lusa]] – Agência de Notícias de Portugal in Portugal
* [[Magyar Távirati Iroda]] (mti) in Hungary
* [[Polska Agencja Prasowa]] (pap) in Poland

== Photojournalists ==
[[Lucas Dolega]], an epa [[photojournalist]], was the first journalist to have been killed during the [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests]] and the first journalist to have died during the [[Arab Spring]] uprisings.&lt;ref&gt;Committee to Protect Journalists. 17 January 2011. “Lucas Mebrouk Dolega.” Retrieved 16 October 2011 [http://cpj.org/killed/2011/lucas-mebrouk-dolega.php CPJ].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

'''Finday''' is a social [[web directory]] and [[search engine]] based on [[Google]]'s technology. It provides users a website ranking system that isn't based on statistics but on human criteria (''see below:'' [[#FindayScore|FindayScore]]), and a directory of websites commented and evaluated on by users.

The website also includes a large amount of important data concerning each site: who owns it, where it's located, what language it's available in, web traffic figures or its popularity within the ranks of the largest Internet communities among others.

==FindayScore==
Finday users can rate with a score from 0 to 10 the most relevant aspects of the sites listed in the search listings.  There are different parameters users can use to rate a site based on its content. The current score for each site is listed to the right of its description, this is called "FindayScore".

The FindayScore of a website represents the value attributed to it by Finday users. It isn't a simple average based on all the scores the website has received, but a weighted average. This means it's modified by other factors such as its popularity on Finday, loading speed, its traffic according to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]], etc.  In other words, the FindayScore mainly considers reviews submitted by users on the most important aspects of a website, but it's automatically modified by other parameters that contribute to improving the validity of the review.

==Domain names==
In addition to the main URL [http://finday.com finday.com], Finday owns [http://es.finday.com es.finday.com] for its localized contents in Spanish.

== Company Information ==
Finday is headquartered in [[Barcelona]], Spain, and it's funded by Grupo Intercom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grupointercom.com/ingles/home.cfm Grupo Intercom web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Flora of North America North of Mexico''''' (usually referred to as '''''FNA''''') is a multivolume work describing the [[native plant]]s of [[North America]]. Much of the Flora is already available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efloras.org/flora_page.aspx?flora_id=1 |title=Flora of North America |work=eFloras.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to fill 30 volumes when completed and will be the first work to treat all of the known flora north of [[Mexico]].

It is a collaboration of over 800 authors, who collaborate over the web.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | doi = 10.1109/HICSS.1998.651712 | title = Managing cognitive overload in the Flora of North America project | year = 1998 | author = Tomlinson, K.L. | volume = 2 | page = 296 | last2 = Sanchez | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Spasser | first3 = M.A. | last4 = Schnase | first4 = J.L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="978">In '''''Govender v Ragavayah''''', an important case in the [[South African law of succession]], the applicant was a woman married in terms of Hindu rites, whose husband had died intestate. Accordingly, the parents of her husband stood to inherit his estate. The court noted that Hindu marriages were not recognised in South African law, which violated section 9 of the Constitution. Accordingly, the court ordered that the definition of “spouse” in section 1 of the Intestate Succession Act include the surviving spouse of a monogamous Hindu marriage. It is important to note that the ambit of this judgment was restricted to ''de facto'' monogamous Hindu marriages.

'''The Guantanamo Bay Museum of Art and History''' is a fictional museum created by the American artist [[Ian Alan Paul]]. The museum exists virtually as a [http://www.guantanamobaymuseum.org/ website] and is also installed in real-world galleries in a series of satellite exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;UC Berkeley hosts the Guantanamo Bay Museum of Art and History Satellite Exhibition http://www.worthrydergallery.org/2013/08/guantanamo-bay-museum-of-art-and.html&lt;/ref&gt; The museum claims to be based in [[Guantanamo Bay, Cuba]] at the site of the former [[Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp]] which according to the museum's history has been closed since 2012 when the museum was built to replace it.&lt;ref&gt;"Exploring the History of The  Guantanamo Bay Museum of Art and History" http://www.guantanamobaymuseum.org/?url=about&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum hosts [http://www.guantanamobaymuseum.org/?url=exhibitions artists works] in its collection which reflect on and critique the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility]], contains a [http://www.guantanamobaymuseum.org/?url=critstudies center for critical studies] which collects texts about Guantanamo Bay including essays from [[Judith Butler]] and [[Derek Gregory]], and runs an [http://www.guantanamobaymuseum.org/?url=residency artist in residency program] that produces new works for exhibitions. The museum is also listed as a real place on [[Google Maps]] just north of the detention facility.&lt;ref&gt;"The Imaginary Art Museum at Gitmo" https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/the-imaginary-art-museum-at-gitmo/261740/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

When the fictional museum was first made public it was covered by a variety of international publications including by the [[Agence France-Presse]],&lt;ref&gt;"Un musée virtuel à Guantanamo en souvenir de la prison" http://www.lapresse.ca/international/amerique-latine/201209/08/01-4572300-un-musee-virtuel-a-guantanamo-en-souvenir-de-la-prison.php&lt;/ref&gt; Studio Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;"C’è un museo a Guantanamo" http://www.rivistastudio.com/editoriali/arte/ce-un-museo-a-guantanamo/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[the Atlantic]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Imaginary Art Museum at Gitmo" https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/the-imaginary-art-museum-at-gitmo/261740/&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Atlantic]] described the museum in this way after its opening:

{{Quote|text="While creating imaginary entities is a tried-and-true protest technique, its application in this specific case is brilliant. Gitmo is a peculiar invention that only exists thanks to a tangle of legal rulings that allow Americans to pretend that Gitmo is not a part of America, even though it’s governed and controlled by Americans. No one really gets to see the place, as reporters’ and other visitors’ experiences are crafted by the authorities. The detention camp, as a place where people are held and interrogated, remains an imaginary place for all but the prisoners and the national security officials who operate it. The imaginary museum draws its power from this resonance: If Gitmo exists because of one fiction, perhaps it can be closed by another? Or put another (augmented) way, germane to this digital project: if we change Gitmo’s website, can it actually change its physical and legal reality? That’s what the museum’s organizers are hoping."|sign=[[Alexis Madrigal]]|source=''"The Imaginary Art Museum at Gitmo" | https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/the-imaginary-art-museum-at-gitmo/261740/''}}

After the project's launch, [[Ian Alan Paul]] has given lectures and talks at universities, museums, and conferences as the head curator and creator of the museum, and the artworks from the museum are shown in galleries as an extension and elaboration of the project's fiction.&lt;ref&gt;"Differential Mobilities: The Guantanamo Bay Museum of Art and History"http://www.mobilities.ca/ian-alan-paul/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harley Leland Race''' (born April 11, 1943)&lt;ref name="Book"&gt;{{cite news|first=Harley|last=Race|title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story|publisher=Sports Publishing|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American former [[professional wrestler]] and current [[professional wrestling promotion|promoter]] and trainer.&lt;ref name=oww&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/h/harley-race.html|title=Harley Race|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2009-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his career as a wrestler, Race worked for all of the major wrestling promotions, including the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now [[WWE]]), and [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). He has held the [[WWA World Heavyweight Championship]] once and the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] [[List of NWA World Heavyweight Champions|seven times]] and was the first [[List of WWE United States Champions|NWA United States Heavyweight Champion]], which is now known as the WWE's [[WWE United States Championship|United States Championship]].

Race is one of six men inducted into each of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]], the [[NWA Hall of Fame]], the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] and the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]], and is considered by many wrestlers, promoters and fans as one of the best/if not the  best  professional wrestler of all time.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} He is highly respected for his toughness and lifelong dedication to the business.

== Early life ==
Race was an early fan of professional wrestling, watching programming from the nearby [[Chicago]] territory on the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont Network]]. After overcoming [[Poliomyelitis|polio]] as a child,&lt;ref&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.234)&lt;/ref&gt; he began training as a professional wrestler as a teen under former world champions [[Stanislaus Zbyszko|Stanislaus]] and [[Wladek Zbyszko]], who operated a [[farm]] in his native Missouri. While in [[high school]], an altercation with another classmate led to the principal kneeing Race in the back of the head as he tried to break up the fight. Enraged, Race attacked him, resulting in his expulsion. Already {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m|abbr=on}} and {{convert|225|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, Race decided to get his start in professional wrestling. Race then became the driver of [[Happy Humphrey]] who was too large to drive at the time.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1960–1965)===
Race was recruited by St. Joseph wrestling promoter Gust Karras who hired Race to do odd jobs for his promotion, including [[chauffeur]]ing the {{convert|800|lb|kg|abbr=on}} wrestler [[Happy Humphrey]]. Eventually, Race started wrestling on some of his shows and some of Karras' veteran wrestlers helped further Race's training. At the age of 18, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] and began wrestling under the [[ring name]] of '''Jack Long''', forming a tag team with [[Kayfabe|storyline]] brother John Long. The duo quickly captured the Southern Tag Team Championship. Race was seen as a rising star in the business with a bright future until a car accident put him out of action, with his leg coming close to being amputated. His pregnant first wife, Vivian Louise Jones, died instantly; they had been married just over a month. Karras heard about his employee's condition, went rushing into the hospital, and blocked the planned amputation, declaring it "over my dead body." In doing so, he saved Race's leg. Although he recovered, doctors told Race that he might never walk again, and his wrestling career was over. Undaunted, Race endured grueling physical therapy for several months and made a full recovery. Race next went on to face Jack Pfefer and Tony Santos in the Boston territory as the Great Mortimer in 1963.

He returned to the ring in 1964, wrestling for the [[Terry Funk|Funks']] [[Amarillo, Texas]], territory. This time, he wrestled as '''Harley Race''', after his father told him that he should not work to make anyone else's name famous. Race never again used a different ring name. In Amarillo, Race met fellow up-and-coming wrestler [[Larry Hennig]] (later Larry "The Axe" Hennig and father of [[Curt Hennig|"Mr. Perfect" Curt Hennig]]). The two formed a tag team and moved to the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA).

=== American Wrestling Association (1965–1986, 1990) ===
In the AWA, Race and Hennig branded themselves as "Handsome" Harley Race (which was actually a moniker given to him by fans in [[Japan]]) and "Pretty Boy" Larry Hennig, portraying a cocky [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] (villain) [[tag team]] with a penchant for breaking the rules to win matches. They quickly became top contenders, and in January 1965, they were scripted [[Dick the Bruiser]] and [[The Crusher (wrestler)|The Crusher]] and granted the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]]. Race and Hennig were designated to feud with the Bruiser and Crusher and other top teams for the next several years, and were given three title reigns. [[Verne Gagne]], in particular, was promoted as a hated rival of the team, and was assigned many different partners to wrestle against Race and Hennig during their AWA run. In October 1967, Gagne was credited with "breaking" one of Hennig's legs, thus giving him some much needed time off from the ring. Race (as the storyline went), was allowed to choose a new partner and retain the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Harley's choice was Chris Markoff, but the duo was relieved of the championship for their first title defense match against the team of [[Pat O'Connor (wrestler)|Pat O'Connor]] and Wilbur Snyder in November 1967. For the next several months, Race teamed with Hard Boiled Haggerty (Don Stansauk) who over the years presented Verne Gagne with some of his greatest matches. Together, Race and Haggerty often were cast against Gagne and [[Bill Watts|"Cowboy" Bill Watts]]. In March 1968, after Hennig's return to the ring, he and Harley were back together, though the two never were reassigned the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Despite his tag team success, Race left the AWA after several years at the top of the division to pursue a singles' career in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA).

Race returned to the AWA in 1984 to wrestle [[Curt Hennig]]. The confrontation was fueled by Larry Hennig confronting his former tag team partner at the end of the match. Race would also wrestle former [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship|AWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Rick Martel]] as part of [[WrestleRock 86|WrestleRock]] in April 1986. Toward the end of his in-ring career, he would return to the AWA, most notably cast against [[Larry Zbyszko]] for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship match in 1990, which was featured as the main event of an AWA broadcast on [[ESPN]]. However, all of these matches from 1990 ended up as just special appearances and Race ultimately did not sign with the promotion.

=== National Wrestling Alliance (1970–1984) ===
[[File:Dusty and Harley 2.jpg|thumb|[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] prepares to face Race (in the background) in 1979]]

Race jumped from territory to territory in the early 1970s, renewing his rivalry with [[Terry Funk]] in [[Amarillo, Texas]] and winning a regional title. He was seen as a gifted territorial wrestler, not quite ready for the worldwide spotlight, until 1973. In [[Kansas City]], he did very well teaming with Roger "Nature Boy" Kirby. As a singles wrestler, he held the [[NWA Missouri Heavyweight Championship]] as well as the [[Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling|Mid-Atlantic]] version of the [[WWE United States Championship|NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]]. He also started what would be many tours to Japan where he faced [[Giant Baba]].

In 1973, Race took the nickname "Mad Dog" and faced [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in Kansas City. Race emerged from the battle as the new world champion in what was perceived by fans as a stunning upset. Behind the scenes, Funk had pulled out of losing the title to [[Jack Brisco]], citing injuries in a truck accident; in truth, Amarillo promoter [[Dory Funk Sr.]] did not want his son losing the title to a fellow [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] (a fan favorite). Race, a known tough street fighter, was under orders from the NWA not to let Funk leave the ring as champion that night.&lt;ref name=won&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Dave Meltzer|last=Meltzer|first=Dave|title=A Definitive Look At Jack Brisco; his life and times|journal=Wrestling Observer Newsletter|date=February 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ending was a "work" with Funk dropping the title in a third fall as planned and TV announcer Bill Kersten dropping the "Mad Dog" nickname during the match.

A televised title defense from this first reign, held in [[Calgary]] against [[Klondike Bill]] and aired as the main event on an episode of the promotion's eponymous ''[[Stampede Wrestling]]'' program (where Race successfully defended his title), resurfaced during the 21st century as part of the [[WWE Video Library]]. Most of his televised matches of this era were [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squash matches]] held in television studios. Though Race held the title for only a few months, losing it to Brisco in [[Houston, Texas]] in July, he became a worldwide superstar and perennial championship contender.

Race was determined to eventually regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, often moving between territories and collecting several regional titles, including eight Central States Heavyweight Championship, seven Missouri Heavyweight Championship, the Georgia Heavyweight Championship, the [[Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship]] in [[Canada]], the [[Japan]]-based [[NWA United National Heavyweight Championship|NWA United National Heavyweight]] and [[PWF World Heavyweight Championship]]s, and becoming the first-ever holder of the Mid-Atlantic United States Heavyweight Championship, still defended today as the [[WWE United States Championship]]. This kept Race in contention for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, and Race vowed that he would only need one chance against the champion to regain it.

Race finally got his wish in 1977, facing familiar rival Terry Funk, who had become the champion since their previous encounters, in [[Toronto]]. Race won the title by submission with the Indian Death Lock, a rarely used submission move but one that put great pressure on Funk's injured leg. The NWA World Heavyweight Champion once again, Race this time established his dominance, defending the title up to six times a week and holding it for almost five years (excluding extremely short reigns by Tommy Rich, Dusty Rhodes, and Giant Baba). Race feuded with many of the legends of the NWA including Dory Funk, Dusty Rhodes, Dick the Bruiser, Pat Patterson and Angelo Poffo. In 1978, he had a series of violent matches throughout the Midwest with the Sheik, culminating in a bloody "2x4 with a nail in it" match in front of 12,313 at Cobo Hall. The NWA, AWA and WWF were on good terms, and Race engaged in title versus title matches with [[WWE World Champion|WWF Heavyweight Champions]] [[Superstar Billy Graham]] and [[Bob Backlund]], as well as AWA World Heavyweight Champion Nick Bockwinkel. Race toured extensively all over the country and the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and many stints in [[Japan]], where he was already well known from his visits with Larry Hennig. On October 13, 1978, Harley Race body slammed [[André the Giant]].

[[File:Dusty and Harley 3.jpg|thumb|Race battles longtime rival [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]]]
Race, after countless victories over many years over Rhodes and other great wrestlers, lost the title to Dusty Rhodes in 1981.  Rhodes lost the title to up-and-coming star [[Ric Flair]], though Race was able to defeat Flair in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] in 1983 for his seventh reign as champion, breaking the record previously held by [[Lou Thesz]]. What followed was one of the classic [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#A|angles]] of the 1980s, which led to the first-ever NWA's [[Starrcade (1983)|Starrcade]] event. Determined not to lose the title again, Race offered a $25,000 bounty to anyone who could eliminate Flair from the NWA. Bob Orton, Jr. and Dick Slater attacked Flair, inflicting what appeared to be a career-ending neck injury, and collecting the bounty from Race after Flair announced his retirement. Flair's retirement was a ruse, however, and he eventually returned to action, much to Race's surprise. NWA officials set up a championship rematch, to be titled "Starrcade: A Flare for the Gold". The match was to be held in Flair's backyard, [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], which enraged Race. Race lost the title to Flair in the bloody and memorable Starcade [[Professional wrestling match types#Steel cages|steel cage match]] (with [[Gene Kiniski]] as the special referee.) Flair jumped on top of Race from top rope and pinned him to become champion.

He would regain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a short two-day reign in [[New Zealand]] in 1984, after many years,it is now a recognized title change.., but his loss to Flair at Starrcade was largely seen as the torch-passing from Race to Flair. Flair would go on and he credits Race for igniting his career. Later, Race left NWA because NWA President Sam Mushnick was "losing his capabilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2015/0825/599933/harley-race-talks-leaving-nwa-for-wwf/|title=Harley Race Talks Leaving NWA For WWF, Why He Left, Hulk Hogan, The 'King' Gimmick, Vince, More - WrestlingInc.com|work=WrestlingInc.com|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wrestling Federation (1986–1989) ===
In May 1986, Race entered the WWF managed by longtime friend [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]], bleaching his hair blond and billing himself again as "Handsome" Harley Race. During a time when the WWF did not recognize the existence of other promotions and the accomplishments a wrestler made there, WWF officials came up with a solution to recognize his wrestling pedigree by having him win the [[King of the Ring]] tournament. After this, he referred to himself as "King" Harley Race, coming to the ring in a royal crown and cape, to the ceremonial accompaniment of the tenth movement (known as "The Great Gates of Kiev") of ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]]. After winning a match, Harley would make his defeated opponent "bow and kneel" before him. Usually Bobby Heenan would assist the defeated opponent to "bow and kneel" by grabbing their hair and forcing them to bow before King Harley Race.

He participated in a notable feud with the [[Junkyard Dog]], culminating in a match at [[WrestleMania III]] at the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], in which Race cleanly pinned The Junkyard Dog after a textbook [[Suplex#Belly-to-belly suplex|Belly-to-belly suplex]]. As per the stipulations of the match, the JYD was required to bow to Race as the winner, but after he bowed and Race got up, JYD grabbed the chair he was sitting on and attacked Race before leaving with The King's cape to a standing ovation. Race would spend 1987 feuding with [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Jim Duggan]], who during a televised confrontation took Race's crown and robe, though Race later attacked Duggan, and then took them back.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} The latter of his feud with Duggan was highlighted by an extended brawl at the 1987 [[Slammy Awards]]. In early 1988, he suffered an abdominal injury in a match against Hogan in which he tried to hit Hogan, prone on a table at ringside, with a swandive headbutt. Hogan moved out of the way and Race impacted the table inwards. The metal edge forced its way up into Race's abdomen giving him a [[hernia]]. Following this incident and during his recovery, the WWF ran an angle where they acknowledged his injury, and his manager Bobby Heenan vowed to crown a new king. He left the WWF in early 1989, following a brief comeback from hernia surgery and an attempt to regain his crown from the new King, [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]], at the [[Royal Rumble (1989)|Royal Rumble]].

=== Post-WWF endeavors (1989–1991)===
After leaving the WWF, Harley continued to wrestle until the spring of 1991, most notably with [[World Wrestling Council]] (WWC) in [[Puerto Rico]], Stampede Wrestling in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta]] the NWA, and the AWA. During this period, Race would received one last shot at a recognized world title when he faced AWA champion [[Larry Zbyszko]] at the final AWA television taping in August 1990. The match ended in a double countout.

=== World Championship Wrestling (1990–1995, 1999)===
Race made his return to the promotion at [[The Great American Bash (1990)|The Great American Bash]] on July 7, 1990 when he defeated former NWA World Heavweight Champion [[Tommy Rich]]. He began making appearances on [[house show]]s and immediately would fill in for Ric Flair in several tag team matches, pairing up with [[Barry Windham]] against [[Lex Luger]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw90.htm WWE History - 1990] thehistoryofwwe Retrieved 16 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Race would continue a program with Tommy Rich through the rest of the summer, as well as facing [[Brian Pillman]] and Wendell Cooley. In September, he received several United States Heavyweight Championship title shots against then champion [[Lex Luger]]. In October, Race renewed his rivalry with The Junkyard Dog in two matches on the WCW house show circuit and finished the year facing [[Michael Wallstreet]]. During a house show match in St. Joseph, Missouri on December 7, 1990, he sustained a shoulder injury and would ultimately retire from active competition.

Race made his first subsequent appearance six months later as a guest referee during a house show on June 14, 1991 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. One year after making his initial return on The Great American Bash in 1990, Race returned at the [[The Great American Bash (1991)|1991 The Great American Bash]] to become the adviser/manager to Lex Luger. Excelling as a manager as he had as a wrestler, he immediately lead Luger to the [[WCW World Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name=cold102&gt;Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt; He managed Luger throughout his title run, as well as acquiring the contract for [[Curtis Hughes|Mr. Hughes]] from [[Terri Runnels|Alexandra York]].

In 1992, Race began to add other wrestlers to a stable that would include [[Big Van Vader]], [[Hercules (wrestler)|Super Invader]] and Vinnie Vegas ([[Kevin Nash]]). The stable was short-lived, and after Vader defeated Sting for the world championship on July 12, 1992 he became Race's primary charge. During his management of Vader, Race met with racial controversy when Vader was feuding with WCW wrestler [[Ron Simmons]] when saying during a [[Promo (professional wrestling)|promo]], "When I was world champion, I had a boy like you to carry my bags!". This was actually part of the booking strategy of then-WCW head [[Bill Watts]] to build support for Simmons, whom he would eventually make champion. The wily veteran was popular among the young WCW talent, and developed close friendships with [[Mick Foley]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Steve Austin]], among others. On June 9, 1993 at a TV taping in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]], he began managing The Colossal Kongs, and on July 7 at ''[[WCW WorldWide|WorldWide]] tapings in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[Yoshi Kwan]] joined his stable.

Harley Race returned to the ring a final time on a trio of Florida house shows (November 26, 1993 in Davie, November 27 in Orlando, and November 28 in Jacksonville), when he substituted for an injured Vader to face Ric Flair. His former rival would come out victorious on each occasion. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/wcw93.htm&lt;/ref&gt; These would be the last wrestling matches of his career. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=341&amp;page=4&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing the title at [[Starrcade (1993)|Starrcade]] in December 1993, Big Van Vader quickly became Race's sole stable member again. Race continued to manage Vader in the following months in rematches against Flair, and on May 22, 1994 he was inducted into the [[WCW Hall of Fame]] during the Slamboree 94 PPV.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He continued to appear at Vader's side through the rest of the year.

As his early wrestling career had been nearly derailed due to a car accident, another car accident in January 1995 forced Race out of the wrestling business altogether. Race required hip replacement surgery, which, along with injuries accumulated after years in the ring, prevented him from even being a manager. He would make a few independent appearances against another Nature Boy, Ric Flair but his inability to work was just too great. He would make one last return to WCW television in October 1999 as the ring announcer for the [[Bret Hart]] vs. [[Chris Benoit]] tribute to [[Owen Hart]] match in his hometown of Kansas City.

=== Later career ===
Race returned to WWE television in 2004 shortly after being inducted into their Hall of Fame. On an episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', [[Randy Orton]] confronted Race and spat in his face, to go with Orton's "Legend Killer" persona. Race returned again for ''Raw''{{'}}s ''WWE Homecoming'' episode in October 2005, marking the show's return to the [[USA Network]]. Race, along with the other legends who were in the ring, gave [[Rob Conway]] a lesson in respect.

In 2004, Harley Race was recruited to be a part of [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] as a member of their NWA Championship Committee. Despite reportedly being an authority figure as a member of the committee, he never made any official decisions and only made the occasional on-screen appearance for the company. In 2006 he appeared at a Scott D`Amore card in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].

At the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2007)|class of 2007]] ceremony on March 31, 2007, Race and [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] were "inducted" into the [[Four Horsemen (professional wrestling)|Four Horsemen]] by [[Ric Flair]] and [[Arn Anderson]]. On the August 8, 2008 episode of ''Monday Night Raw'', Race sat in the front row and was acknowledged by commentators [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] and [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry "The King" Lawler]]. Before the show, Race accompanied then-[[GHC Heavyweight Champion]] [[Takeshi Morishima]] to the ring for a dark match against [[Charlie Haas]].

Race also made an appearance at [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]]'s [[TNA Lockdown (2007)|Lockdown]] pay-per-view in 2007 as the special guest gatekeeper for the main event. Race made a special guest appearance at the second night of [[Ring of Honor]]'s Glory by Honor VI: Night Two at the [[Manhattan Center]] on November 3, 2007 in [[New York City]].

On January 4, 2014, Race took part in [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]]'s [[Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome]] event, taking part in the title presentation before a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and punching out defending champion [[Rob Conway]]'s manager Bruce Tharpe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/otherppvs/article_75461.shtml|title=Caldwell's NJPW Tokyo Dome results 1/4: Complete "virtual-time" coverage of New Japan's biggest show of the year - four title changes, former WWE/TNA stars featured, more|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2014-01-04|accessdate=2014-01-05|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promoting career ==

=== Heart of America Sports Attractions (1973–1986) ===
Earlier in his career, Race became involved in the ownership side of wrestling, buying a portion of the Kansas City and later St. Louis territories known as [[Heart of America Sports Attractions]]. St. Louis was a stronghold of the NWA, and around this time in 1984, WWF owner [[Vince McMahon|Vincent K. McMahon]] began his invasion of NWA territories, including St. Louis, in his ambition to build a truly national wrestling promotion. Race was enraged, famously confronting [[Hulk Hogan]] and the Funk brothers at a WWF event in Kansas City. Race lost over $500,000 as an owner of the Kansas City territory, and despite his championship years being at an end and wishing to retire from active competition, was forced to rely on continuing to wrestle to make a living. He continued to travel in the United States and abroad, and signed with McMahon's WWF in 1986.

=== World League Wrestling (1999–present) ===
Race spent several years away from the business, working briefly as a process server before retiring with his wife in small-town Missouri. In 1999, he started [[World League Wrestling]] (originally called World Legion Wrestling, but the name was changed a year later), an independent promotion which runs shows near Race's hometown of [[Eldon, Missouri]] and other cities in Missouri including Kansas City. A year later, he started [[Harley Race's Wrestling Academy]], which seeks to train up-and-coming wrestlers who could benefit from Race's unique experience and perspective on the wrestling business. Race's events are family-oriented, and usually raise funds for local charities. As well as featuring his students, legends like [[Mick Foley]], [[Terry Funk]], [[Bret Hart]], and even [[Mitsuharu Misawa]] make guest appearances. WLW had a working agreement with Misawa's [[Japan]]ese promotion, [[Pro Wrestling NOAH]] and had NOAH star [[Takeshi Morishima]] as a former heavyweight champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harleyrace.com/morishima.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-02-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228112356/http://www.harleyrace.com/morishima.htm |archivedate=2007-02-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with training [[Trevor Murdoch]] who was then known as Trevor Rhodes, and NOAH veterans Superstar Steve, Wild Wade Chism, [[Matt Murphy (wrestler)|Matt Murphy]] and Daniel Cross.

In 2014, Race and World League Wrestling relocated to Troy, MO. Along with relocating his wrestling academy and promotion, Race also built the Race Wrestling Arena - where events are put on once a month.

== Personal life ==
Race was born to sharecroppers George and Mary Race in 1943. He married three times. Race married his first wife, Vivian Jones, in 1960. She died five weeks after their wedding in the same car crash in which Race nearly lost a leg. His second wife, whom Race refused to mention by name in his 2004 book ''King of the Ring'', divorced him after a few years of marriage in 1990. Together they had a son, Justin Race, who was an [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]] but never a professional. His third wife Beverley, also known as B.J. was [[vice president]] of the Commerce Bank of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] when they married in late 1995 after Race's career-ending car crash earlier that year. She often traveled with Race until she died of pneumonia. Race has five grandchildren.

Race continued running World League Wrestling (WLW) and his wrestling camp in [[Eldon, Missouri]]. He later moved the businesses to nearby Troy. Many of his trainees were sent to the NOAH promotion in [[Japan]] for extra seasoning. Over the years he needed [[surgery]] to his neck, hip replacements, knee replacements and had five [[vertebra]] in his back fused together due to the years of taking hard bumps. In May 2017 he broke both legs in a fall at his home, one in several places. He needed four [[blood transfusion]]s during surgery. As of December 2017, Harley is still promoting WLW as he continues his rehab.

== Other media ==
Race participated in the 1999 [[NBC]] special, ''[[Exposed! Pro Wrestling's Greatest Secrets]]''. His face was covered to conceal his identity as he broke kayfabe and discussed the inner workings of the business. Harley's autobiography, ''King of the Ring: the Harley Race Story'' ({{ISBN|1-58261-818-6}}), was released on November 19, 2004. Along with [[Ricky Steamboat]] and [[Les Thatcher]], Race is author of ''The Professional Wrestler's Workout and Instructional Guide''.

Race played himself as the distinguished [[ring announcer]] for a tag team match involving [[Mil Mascaras]] and [[El Hijo del Santo]] in the 2007 film ''[[Mil Mascaras vs. the Aztec Mummy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmvsam.com |title=MMvsAM}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="popmatters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/mil-mascaras-resurrection|title=PopMatters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2598">{{Short description|American painter}}
'''Hereward Lester Cooke''' (1916–1973) was an [[United States|American]] painter.

Cooke was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]] in 1916. He studied at [[Oxford University]], the [[Art Students League]] (under [[George Bridgman]]), the [[Yale University]] School of Fine Art, and [[Princeton University]] Graduate School, where he received his Ph.D.

Cooke is known more for his work in art history than for his painting, having written several texts, especially ''Painting Lessons from the Great Masters'' in 1967. He was the Curator of Painting at the [[National Gallery of Art]] from 1961–1973, and before that a National Gallery Aide and its acting assistant director, beginning in 1956. Part of his duties as curator included heading the Expert Opinions Section of the National Gallery, where owners of artworks could come and have their art appraised or otherwise identified. He was a well-known authority on fakes and forgeries and was called the "Sherlock Holmes of the Art World" for his work in solving art mysteries of attribution. As a curator, Cooke was also very influential in the government-sponsored art programs, helping to select artists for the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] art program and serving as art advisor to [[NASA]] for ten years. He organized the National Gallery Exhibit of NASA art in 1969.

Cooke's successes may have been more visible in art history, but he was also well regarded as an artist. Not only was he appointed director of the American pavilion at the [[Venice Biennale|Venice Biannual International Art Exhibition]], he was also named artist-in-residence at Princeton for four years and later won the [[Rome Prize|Prix de Rome]] and a [[Fulbright Fellowship]]. In 1940 he won the American Beaux Arts prize for [[mural]]s. Cooke died in 1973.

{{notability|date=September 2011}}
'''HotJava Views''' was a [[productivity suite|productivity]] [[software suite]] developed by [[Sun Microsystems]] and implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. It was released in 1996 and was intended primarily for [[JavaStation]] or other [[JavaOS]]-based [[network computer]]s.

HotJava Views consisted of four applications:

;MailView: [[IMAP4]] [[e-mail client]]
;CalendarView: Group scheduling
;WebView: [[HotJava]] [[web browser]]
;NameView: Directory services

The [[graphical user interface]] of HotJava Views was quite novel in that it dispensed with some of the common features of GUIs in order to simplify the interface. [[Menu bar]]s and overlapping, resizable windows were eliminated and a simple ''Selector'' icon bar was used to switch between applications. Other third-party Java applications could be added to the Selector.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18626">In [[Japanese mythology]], the story of the {{nihongo|birth of the gods|神産み|'''Kamiumi'''}} occurs after the creation of Japan (''[[Kuniumi]]'') and refers to the birth of the ''[[kami]]'', descendants of [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]].

==Story==
[[File:Creation myths of Japan 3-eng.svg|thumb|400px|Genealogy of Izanagi and Izanami according to the [[Kojiki]]]]
According to the [[Kojiki]], various gods were born from the relationship between Izanagi and Izanami until the fire deity, [[Kagutsuchi]], at birth burned Izanami's genitals and wounded her fatally.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p77-78"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kojiki-p79"/&gt; Izanagi, witnessing the death of his beloved wife, in rage took the ten-grasp&lt;ref group="nb" name="grasp"&gt;A "grasp" is the breadth of four fingers when the hand is clenched.&lt;/ref&gt; sabre and crushed his child, Kagutsuchi.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p80-81"/&gt; A number of gods were born from the blood and remains of Kagutsuchi.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p80-81"/&gt; Subsequently, Izanagi went to the land of [[Yomi]] (the world of the dead) to find Izanami, however when he found her, she had become a rotting corpse and from her parts other gods had arisen, causing the flight of Izanagi to the world of the living.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt; Then Izanagi performed the [[misogi]] [[ritual purification]] through which more gods are born.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p84-85"/&gt;  The last of these are the three most important gods of [[Shinto]]: [[Amaterasu]], goddess of the sun; [[Tsukuyomi]], deity of the moon; and [[Susanoo]], god of the sea.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p86"/&gt;

===Birth of the gods===
After having created the Eight Large Islands (''[[Ōyashima]]'') and other islands during the [[Kuniumi|creation of Japan]], Izanagi and Izanami decided to give birth to other gods, among them household deities,&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Despite the existence of the Japanese article, {{nihongo|''Katakurokushin''|[[:ja:家宅六神|家宅六神]]}} usually refers to Chinese deities and extending the term to Japanese gods has no long history or has any appreciably wide acceptance.&lt;/ref&gt; deities of the wind, trees and meadows, all born spontaneously:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p77-78"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|pp=77–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Creation myths of Japan 4-eng.svg|thumb|300px|Gods born during the agony and death of Izanami.]]

During Kagutsuchi's birth, Izanami's genitals were burned and she was mortally wounded. In her agony, from her vomit, urine and feces more gods were born.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p79"/&gt;
# &lt;li value="18"&gt;{{nihongo|'''[[Kanayamabiko]]'''|[[:ja:金山彦神|金山毘古神]]}}, born from the [[vomiting|vomit]] and [[feces]] of Izanami&lt;/li&gt;

#: Wakumusuhi had a daughter:
## {{nihongo|'''[[Toyouke-Ōmikami|Toyouke]]'''|豊宇気毘売神}}

===Death of Kagutsuchi===
After the agony, Izanami dies. At the time Izanagi crept moaning about the body and mourned her death. From his tears {{nihongo|'''[[Nakisawame]]'''|[[:ja:ナキサワメ|泣沢女神]]}} was born. Subsequently Izanagi buried Izanami on [[Mount Hiba (Shimane)|Mount Hiba]]. His sadness turned into anger and he decided to kill Kagutsuchi with a ten-grasp&lt;ref group="nb" name="grasp"/&gt; sword called {{nihongo|'''[[Ame-no-ohabari]]'''|[[:ja:天之尾羽張]]|extra=also known as Itsu-no-ohabari}}.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kojiki-p80-81"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|pp=80–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the blood of Kagutsuchi the following gods emerged:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p80-81"/&gt;

# {{nihongo|'''[[Iwasaku]]'''|[[:ja:イワサク・ネサク|石折神]]}}&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chamberlain: Ihasaku&lt;/ref&gt;

#: The gods above were born from the blood that fell from the tip of the sword in the rocks.

# {{nihongo|'''[[Odoyamatsumi]]'''|淤縢山津見神}}, from the chest;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Okuyamatsumi]]'''|奥山津見神}}, from the abdomen;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Kurayamatsumi]]'''|闇山津見神}}, from the genitals;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Shigiyamatsumi]]'''|志藝山津見神}}, from the left arm;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Hayamatsumi]]'''|羽山津見神}}, from the right arm;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Harayamatsumi]]'''|原山津見神}}, from the left foot;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Toyamatsumi]]'''|戸山津見神}}, from the right foot.

===Land of Yomi===
Izanagi then decided to bring back Izanami and goes to [[Yomi-no-kuni]], the underworld. Crossing the gates to that world, he met Izanami and says to her:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The countries that you and me have created have not been completed yet. Let us return!&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;「あなたと一緒に創った国土はまだ完成していません。帰りましょう。」. ''[[Kojiki]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Izanami replied:

{{quote|Too bad you did not come before, for I have eaten in the country of Yomi! [By eating food in the land of Yomi, one ends up stuck being a resident of Yomi. This concept is called, "Yomotsu Hegui (黄泉戸喫)."]&lt;ref&gt;戸部民夫 『日本神話』 29-30頁。&lt;/ref&gt; ... however, I will consult with the gods of Yomi. Under no circumstances you may look at me!&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;「黄泉の国の食べ物を食べてしまったので、生き返ることはできません」「黄泉神と相談しましょう。お願いですから、私の姿は見ないで下さいね。」. ''[[Kojiki]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On saying this, Izanami entered the palace of these gods. However, time passed and she did not return and Izanagi began to despair. So he broke one of the tines of his ornamental comb mizura that he wore in the left bun of his hair, lit it in order to light the place and decided to enter the world of dead. He manages to find Izanami but is surprised to see that she lost her beauty and had become a rotting corpse, covered with maggots. Of her body were born the eight Gods of thunder, which were:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt;

# {{nihongo|'''Ōikazuchi'''|大雷}}, from the head of Izanami;
# {{nihongo|'''Honoikazuchi'''|火雷}}, from her chest;
# {{nihongo|'''Kuroikazuchi'''|黒雷}}, from her abdomen;
# {{nihongo|'''Sakuikazuchi'''|折雷}}, from her genitals;
# {{nihongo|'''Wakaikazuchi'''|若雷}}, from her left arm;
# {{nihongo|'''Tsuchiikazuchi'''|土雷}}, from her right arm;
# {{nihongo|'''Naruikazuchi'''|鳴雷}}, from her left foot;
# {{nihongo|'''Fusuikazuchi'''|伏雷}}, from her right foot.

Izanagi, shocked, decided to return home, but Izanami was embarrassed by his appearance and commanded the {{nihongo|Yomotsushikome|黄泉 丑女|lit. "horrible women from the world of darkness"}} to chase Izanagi. In his flight, he took the head-dress from his head, and threw it to the ground where it turned into a bunch of grapes. The Yomotsushikome started to eat them but kept chasing the fleeing Izanagi. So he broke the tine of the comb that he wore in his right bun, and as he threw it to the ground it became bamboo shoots, prompting the Yomotsushikome to eat them and enabling Izanagi to flee.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt;

However, Izanami decided to release the eight gods of thunder and 1,500 warriors from Yomi to continue the pursuit. Izanagi drew and brandished his [[Totsuka-no-Tsurugi]]&lt;ref group="nb" name="grasp"/&gt; sword to continue his flight. As they pursued him, Izanagi reached the {{nihongo|Yomotsu-hirasaka|黄泉比良坂}}, the slope that descends from the land of the living to Yomi. He took three peaches from a tree that had grown in that place and threw them at his pursuers so that they fled.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt;

Izanagi commented:

{{quote|Assistance to all people when they are tired and face difficulties.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;「人々が困っている時に助けてくれ」. ''[[Kojiki]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These peaches were called {{nihongo|Ohokamuzumi-no-mikoto|意富加牟豆美命}}.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt;

Finally, Izanami persecuted Izanagi, but he lifted a rock that a thousand men could not move and blocked the slope with it. At that moment, their eyes met for the last time.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt;

Izanami said:

{{quote|If you behave in this way, I will strangle and kill one thousand men of your land in one day!&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;「私はこれから毎日、一日に千人ずつ殺そう」. ''[[Kojiki]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Izanagi replied:

{{quote|If you do this, I will in one day set up 1,500 parturition houses. So in one day indeed 1,000 men will die and indeed 1,500 are going to be born.&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;「それなら私は人間が決して滅びないよう、一日に千五百人生ませよう」. ''[[Kojiki]]''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These words justified the circle of life and death in humans. For the same reason, Izanami is also called {{nihongo|'''Yomotsu-ohokami'''|黄泉津大神}} or {{nihongo|'''Chishiki-no-ohokami'''|道敷大神}} and the boulder that covers the entrance to the world of the dead is known as {{nihongo|'''Chikaeshi-no-ohokami'''|道返之大神}} or {{nihongo|'''Yomido-no-ohokami'''|黄泉戸大神}} and is today known as {{nihongo|slope of Ifuya|伊賦夜坂}} in [[Izumo, Shimane|Izumo]], [[Shimane Prefecture]].&lt;ref name="kojiki-p82-83"/&gt;

===Purification of Izanagi===
[[File:Creation myths of Japan 5-eng.svg|thumb|300px|Gods that emerged during the purification of Izanagi.]]
Leaving Yomi, Izanagi decided to remove all [[Kegare|uncleanness]] in his body through a purification ceremony (''[[misogi]]'') consisting of a bath in the river at Ahakihara in Tachibana no Ono in Tsukushi. As he stripped his clothes and accessories on the floor the following twelve gods are born:&lt;ref name="kojiki-p84-85"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|pp=84–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# {{nihongo|'''[[Chimata-no-kami|Tsukitatsufunato]]'''|衝立船戸神}}, emerges from the staff;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Michi-no-nagachiha]]'''|道之長乳歯神}}, from the [[Obi (sash)|obi]];
# {{nihongo|'''[[Tokihakashi]]'''|時量師神}}, from the handbag;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Wazurai-no-ushi]]'''|和豆良比能宇斯能神}},&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chamberlain: Wazurahinoushi&lt;/ref&gt; from cloths;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Michimata]]'''|道俣神}}, from the [[hakama]];
# {{nihongo|'''[[Akiguhi-no-ushi]]'''|飽咋之宇斯能神}}, from the crown [[corona]];
# {{nihongo|'''[[Okizakaru]]'''|奥疎神}}, from the armband of the left hand;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Okitsunagisabiko]]'''|奥津那芸佐毘古神}}, from the armband of the left hand;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Okitsukaibera]]'''|奥津甲斐弁羅神}},&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chamberlain: Okitsukahibera&lt;/ref&gt; from the armband of the left hand;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Hezakaru]]'''|辺疎神}}, from the armband of the right hand;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Hetsunagisabiko]]'''|辺津那芸佐毘古神}}, from the armband of the right hand;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Hetsukaibera]]'''|辺津甲斐弁羅神}}, from the armband of the right hand;

Subsequently Izanagi is stripped of impurities from the land of Yomi. In this moment two gods were born:
 
# {{nihongo|'''[[Yasomagatsuhi]]'''|[[:ja:禍津日神|八十禍津日神]]}}
# {{nihongo|'''[[Ōmagatsuhi]]'''|[[:ja:禍津日神|大禍津日神]]}}

Then, shaking off the curse, three gods were born:

# {{nihongo|'''[[Kamunaobi]]'''|神直毘神}}
# {{nihongo|'''[[Ōnaobi]]'''|大直毘神}}
# {{nihongo|'''[[Izunome]]'''|伊豆能売}}

Then, when washing with water the lower parts of his body, two gods were born;

# {{nihongo|'''[[Sokotsuwatatsumi]]'''|底津綿津見神}}
# {{nihongo|'''[[Sokotsutsunoo]]'''|底筒之男神}}

When washing the middle of his body, two more gods were born:

# {{nihongo|'''[[Nakatsuwatatsumi]]'''|中津綿津見神}}
# {{nihongo|'''[[Nakatsutsunoo]]'''|中筒之男神}}

Finally, washing the upper part of his body, two more gods were born:

# {{nihongo|'''[[Uwatsuwatatsumi]]'''|上津綿津見神}}&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;Chamberlain: Uhatsuwatatsumi&lt;/ref&gt;
# {{nihongo|'''[[Uwatsutsunoo]]'''|上筒之男神}}

The trio of Sokotsuwatatsumi, Nakatsuwatatsumi and Uhatsuwatatsumi make up the group of deities called [[Sanjin Watatsumi]], or the gods of water. The trio of Sokotsutsunoo, Nakatsutsunoo and Uhatsutsunoo make up the [[Sumiyoshi Sanjin]] group of deities, gods of fishing and sea, to whom tribute is paid at [[Sumiyoshi Taisha]].&lt;ref name="kojiki-p84-85"/&gt;

In the last step of the purification ceremony, Izanagi washed his left eye from which
{{nihongo|'''[[Amaterasu|Amaterasu Ōmikami]]'''|天照大御神}} was born; washed his right eye from which {{nihongo|'''[[Tsukuyomi|Tsukuyomi-no-mikoto]]'''|月読命}} was born; and when washing his nose, {{nihongo|'''[[Susanoo|Takehayasusanoo-no-mikoto]]'''|建速須佐之男命}} was born.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p84-85"/&gt;

With these three gods called {{nihongo|[[Mihashira-no-uzu-no-miko]]|三貴子|extra=”Three precious children”}}, Izanagi ordered their investiture. Amaterasu received the mandate to govern [[Takamagahara]] and a necklace of jewels called {{nihongo|Mikuratanano-no-kami|御倉板挙之神}} from Izanagi. Tsukuyomi is mandated to govern over the Dominion of the Night, and Takehayasusanoo is to rule the seas.&lt;ref name="kojiki-p86"&gt;{{Harvnb|Chamberlain|2008|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kua Fu''' ({{zh|c=夸父|p=Kuāfù|w=K'ua-fu}}) is a [[giant (mythology)|giant]] in [[Chinese mythology]] who wished to capture the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lib.blcu.edu.cn/per/981/ch/myth/myth.htm |title=Chinese Myth |accessdate=2007-05-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101123124/http://lib.blcu.edu.cn/per/981/ch/myth/myth.htm |archivedate=2007-01-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a grandson of [[Houtu]].&lt;ref&gt;Yang, 155 and 263&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
One day, Kua Fu decided to chase and catch the Sun. He followed the Sun from the East to the West, draining the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Wei River]] (all rivers and lakes crossing his path) to quench his burning thirst.  As he searched for more water, he died of [[Terminal dehydration|dehydration]]. The wooden club he was carrying grew into a vast forest of peach trees called Deng Forest (邓林).&lt;ref&gt;Summary of the story given in the definition of 夸父追日 {{cite book|last1=|first1= |title=现代汉语词典(第七版). A Dictionary of Current Chinese (Seventh Edition) |date=1 September 2016|publisher=商务印书馆. [[The Commercial Press]].|isbn=978-7-100-12450-8|location=北京. [[Beijing]]|pages=513, 755}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one version, Kua Fu turns into a mountain range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uexpress.com/tell-me-a-story/2014/7/20/kua-fu-chases-the-sun-a|title=Kua Fu Chases the Sun (A Chinese Folktale)|last1=Friedman|first=Amy|last2=Johnson|first2=Meredith|publisher=[[uexpress]]|date=2014-07-20|accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Chinese usage, the story of Kua Fu chasing the Sun ([[wikt:夸父追日|夸父追日]]) is used to describe a person who fails to obtain his goal because he greatly overestimates himself.

==Tribe==
"Kua Fu" can also be taken to refer to his people, the Kuafu-shi (s 夸父氏) or "Clan of Kuafu". Since shi can mean both "clan" and "maiden name" and serve as a masculine honorific like "mister" or "sir", it is sometimes used in reference to his people, sometimes in reference to the individual.

During the [[battle of Banquan]], [[Chi You]]'s tribes allied themselves with the Kua Fu tribe and the ''Sanmiao'' (三苗) tribe and attacked the Yan Emperor's tribe, driving them into the lands of the Yellow Emperor.

From 1993 to 2012, '''The London Consortium''' was a graduate school in the UK offering multidisciplinary Masters and Doctoral programs in the [[humanities]] and [[cultural studies]] at the [[University of London]]. It was administered by [[Birkbeck, University of London]], one of the constituent colleges of the [[University of London]], and fell under the Humanities list of courses at Birkbeck.

The London Consortium was a collaborative program composed of Birkbeck, the [[Architectural Association]], [[Institute of Contemporary Arts]], the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] and the [[Tate Gallery]]. As of 2013, The London Consortium exists solely as a legacy partnership between the constituent institutions for the benefit of the remaining PhD students until the completion of their dissertations.

==History==
The Consortium was founded in 1993 by the late social philosopher [[Paul Hirst]] (1947-2003), Mark Cousins, Richard Humphreys, and Colin MacCabe.  Until 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] was part of the Consortium.  After the BFI (British Film Institute) removed its involvement (due to policy changes and external pressures at that institution), it was replaced by the Institute of Contemporary Arts.  In 2007, the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] joined the collaboration, with its Head of Research, Peter Morris, contributing as a core faculty member.

==Faculty==
The Consortium's permanent and adjunct faculty included figures such as the psychoanalytic theorist Parveen Adams, cultural theorist [[Steven Connor]], architectural theorist and philosopher [[Mark Cousins (writer)|Mark Cousins]], Tate curators [[Marko Daniel]] and [[Richard Humphreys (writer)|Richard Humphreys]], film theorist and producer [[Colin MacCabe]], artist and writer [[Tom McCarthy (novelist)|Tom McCarthy]], and film theorist [[Laura Mulvey]]. Past supervisors and visiting faculty have included cultural theorist [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], psychoanalytic theorist [[Juliet Mitchell]], writer [[Marina Warner]], and psychoanalytic philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]].  Its chairman was the lawyer and writer [[Anthony Julius]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mishcon.com/people/anthony_julius&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic Programmes==
The Consortium offered courses taught by faculty from across all five constituent institutions, including professors from Birkbeck and the Architectural Association, curators from the Tate and the Institute of Contemporary Arts, as well as external faculty drawn from various institutions in London and across the UK. Classes were taught in venues at Birkbeck, the Tate Modern and Tate Britain, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the Science Museum.

===Masters===

====MRes Humanities and Cultural Studies====
The Master of Research programme was available only as a one-year full-time course. It was a unique and challenging post-graduate introduction to theories, methods and knowledges in the humanities and cultural studies. Students combined coursework and research throughout, culminating in the production of a dissertation. The Master of Research was taken as a stand-alone degree in its own right, and also acted as a pathway into the Consortium PhD programme.

====MA in Film Curating====
The MA in Film Curating, which was offered for two years beginning in October 2010, was a collaboration between the London Consortium and the London Film School. Bringing together recent thinking about curating contemporary art with the constantly evolving world of film, film festivals, and the movie business, it offered a theoretical exploration into the role of film curating in an age in which digital distribution technologies have transformed both the traditional notion of curating and the commercial film distribution sector. Students also gained practical experience in curating, within the context of existing film festivals like Cannes and Rotterdam, both of which were visited, and through the practical curation of film or film/related events.

===Doctoral===

====PhD Humanities and Cultural Studies====
The Consortium PhD included a taught component. First year PhD students followed the same core courses as those studying towards the MRes, courses designed to give a grounding in multidisciplinary research. Previous core courses included 'Catastrophe', 'St. Paul', 'Godard's ''Contempt'': Text and Pretext', 'Shit and Civilization', 'Metamorphosis', and 'Whiteness'.  Through courses like these, the Consortium could be thought of as developing an original conception of [[Cultural Studies]]. While the [[Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies]] at [[Birmingham University]]—founded by [[Richard Hoggart]] and for a long time the institutional home of [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]]—conceived of Cultural Studies as the study of contemporary [[popular culture]], the London Consortium has sought to develop a research and teaching climate where the study of older historical periods, on the one hand, and of 'high' culture on the other, can take its place alongside the more traditional foci of the discipline. This also entails a different approach to interdisciplinarity. Where interdisciplinary studies had often been content to merely ignore the traditional academic disciplines, and run roughshod over disciplinary boundaries, the London Consortium preferred to describe its activities as ''multidisciplinary'', reflecting the belief that while the best research benefited from being approached from two or more disciplinary perspectives, it must also stand up to the most exacting standards of the disciplines.

== Early life and education ==
Martha Goodway was raised in [[Roslindale, Massachusetts]]. She graduated from Roslindale High School in 1952,&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/roslindalehighsc1952rosl/roslindalehighsc1952rosl_djvu.txt Roslindale High School Yearbook, 1952.]&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a bachelor's degree in general engineering at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cee.mit.edu/cee-in-focus/2011/spring/alumni-news CEE in Focus: Alumni News] (Spring 2011), Civil and Environmental Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; She was one of only nineteen women to earn degrees at MIT that year.&lt;ref&gt;Lynne Robinson,  "Martha Goodway: How History is Made" ''Journal of Metallurgy'' 67(9)(2015): 1918–1920. {{DOI|10.1007/s11837-015-1572-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
After college she became interested in conservation science, and studied with William Young at the Objects Conservation and Scientific Research Laboratory in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. Through Young's connections, she became a metallurgist at the [[Museum Conservation Institute|Conservation Analytical Laboratory]] of the Smithsonian Institution.

'''Maximum Security Prison''' is an inactive prison at [[Robben Island]] in Table Bay, 6.9 kilometers (4.3 mi) west of the coast of [[Bloubergstrand]], [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]]. It was prominent because of [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate and former [[President of South Africa]] [[Nelson Mandela]] was imprisoned there for 18 of the 27 years he served behind bars before the fall of [[apartheid]]. After that, three former inmates of this prison [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Kgalema Motlanthe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7634845.stm|publisher=[[BBC News]]|title=New S.

==History==
Since 1961, Maximum Security Prison was used by the [[South African government]] for political prisoners and convicted criminals.

The maximum security prison for political prisoners closed in 1991 and the medium security prison for criminal prisoners was closed five years later in 1996.&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;[http://www.robben-island.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=62 Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215011620/http://www.robben-island.org.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=62 |date=15 February 2010 }}, Robben Island Museum website, retrieved 8 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Museum of European Cultures''' ({{lang-de|Museum Europäischer Kulturen}}) - [[Berlin State Museums|National Museums in Berlin]] - [[Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation]] came from the unification of the Europe-Department in the Berlin Museum of Ethnography and the Berlin Museum for Folklore in 1999. The museum focuses on the lived-in world of Europe and European culture contact, predominantly in Germany from the 18th Century until today.

The museum, together with the [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]] and the [[Museum of Asian Art]], is located in the Dahlem Museums. The building was named after the architect [[Bruno Paul]] (1874 – 1968) and is located in the modern district of [[Steglitz-Zehlendorf]].  The museum’s exhibition rooms occupy the oldest building in the Dahlem Museums.

==History==
[[File:Exhibition at the Museum Europäischer Kulturen, Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Exhibit of European costumes in the museum]]
The current Museum of European Cultures was established from several previous institutions which arose at the beginning of the 19th century and are due in part to private initiatives as well as governmental foundations.

===The Europe Cabinet===

The basis of the exhibit was two shaman drums of the northern European [[Sami People|Sámi]] which came to the Königlich Preußische Kunstkammer (Royal Prussian Art Collection) at the beginning of the 19th century. In 1859 the [[Neues Museum]] opened which, among others, had an ethnological collection. This collection also held the “Europa” Cabinet, which surmises the nucleus of the current Museum for European Cultures.

===Museum for Folklore===

The Ethnological Museum of the Königlich Preußischen Museen (Royal Prussian Museums) was institutionally founded in 1873. In 1886 the Museum opened in a new building, which also contained European ethnographica, although no collections explicitly from Germany. Plans for a combined exhibit of both non-European objects and European objects, with special consideration of German culture, failed both because of lack of room as well as the founding of a “National Museum”, which presented the history of the European “folk” with a focus on German culture from pre-history until the then present day.&lt;ref&gt;Karasek, Erika/Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (1999): „Das Museum Europäischer Kulturen: Entstehung – Realität – Zukunft, in: Karasek, u.a. (Hg.): Faszination Bild. Kulturkontakte in Europa, Potsdam  Pg. 7-19, Pg. 8f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum for German Traditional Costumes and Handicrafts===

The private initiative of the Berliner physician, anthropologist, and politician [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821-1902) and other members of the Berliner Anthropoligischen Gesellschaft (Berlin Anthropological Organization) led in 1889 to the founding and facilitation of the first Germany-wide central “Museum für deutsche Volkstrachten und Erzeugnisses des Hausgewerbes” (Museum for German Traditional Costumes and Handicrafts). From 1891 the Museum was financed through the Museum Association which was specifically established for this purpose. The goal of the museum was to give room to the cultural objects of their “own people” that had been excluded in ethnology as well as bordering, German-speaking lands. Furthermore, the material goods from the country and farms, which in the wake of [[Industrialization]] had begun to disappear, would be protected.&lt;ref&gt;Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2003): „Wie gegenwartsorientiert können ethnologische Museen Kulturen der Welt darstellen?“ In: Martina Krause, Dagmar Neuland-Kitzerow, Karoline Noack (Hg.), Ethnografisches Arbeiten in Berlin. Wissenschaftsgeschichtliche Annäherungen, Berliner Blätter. Ethnographische und ethnologische Beiträge, Issue 31, Pg. 75-83, Pg. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Royal Collection for German Folklore===

The private Museum for German Traditional Costume and Handicrafts, with the support of the Patron [[Henri James Simon|James Simon]] (1851-1932, from 1904 President of the Museum’s Association) and under the leadership of Karl Brunner (1904-1928), was in 1904 made part of the “Königliche Sammlung für Deutsche Volkskunde” (Royal Collection for German Folklore), part of the Königlich Preußischen Museen zu Berlin. The institution would administratively shelter and take care of the prehistoric department of the Museum for Ethnology. Due to the inexpedient incorporation of the department, the folklore collection there played only a marginal role.&lt;ref&gt;Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2003): „Wie gegenwartsorientiert können ethnologische Museen Kulturen der Welt darstellen?“ In: Martina Krause, Dagmar Neuland-Kitzerow, Karoline Noack (Hg.), Ethnografisches Arbeiten in Berlin. Wissenschaftsgeschichtliche Annäherungen, Berliner Blätter. Ethnographische und ethnologische Beiträge, Issue 31, Pg. 75-83, Pg. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Staatliches Museum für deutsche Volkskunde===

First in 1929 an independent „Staatliches Museum für deutsche Volkskunde“ (State Museum for German Folklore) was established. This museum was legally supported by the National Museums of Berlin. Director Konrad Hahm (1928-1943) preoccupied himself with intensive public work, varying exhibits, and purposeful lectures so that the richness and variety of the museum’s collections could be made known to a large audience. On top of that, he compiled numerous memoirs and conceptions of various forms of the folklore performances in a central Folklore Museum. 
From 1934 until 1945 the Museum for German Folklore received its own building in the [[Bellevue Palace (Germany)|Bellevue Palace]]. The relocation of the exhibition and administration buildings to the Prinzessinnenpalais (Princess Palace) next to the [[Berlin State Opera]] on [[Unter den Linden]] followed in 1938. The collections and workshops were moved as well into the former main building of the German Freemasons in the Splittgerbergasse. Occasionally, the museum made concessions to the ruling ideology of [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. However, numerous exhibits coined from National Socialism and large propaganda shows were not achieved.

Konrad Hahm dedicated himself to the founding of an “Instituts für Volkskunstforschung” (Institute for Folk Art Research) that under his guidance became associated with the Berlin University in 1940. One of the museum affiliated branches, “Schule und Museum” (School and Museum) appeared as early as 1939 in a museum pedagogic perspective. [[Adolf Reichwein]], a progressive and humanistic educator and active resistance fighter in the [[Kreisau Circle]], took over leadership until his arrest and later execution in October 1944.

With the establishment of a “Eurasian” department in the Museum for Ethnology, whose institution was consistent with the National Socialist ideology, the folklore collections had to give all of their “non-German” collection to the Museum for Ethnology. The museum, meanwhile, had to transfer all of their “German” objects to the Museum for German Folklore.  Thereby a new institutional separation occurred between the two fields. In World War II, the museums lost numerous objects due to destruction, looting, and relocation to other places.&lt;ref&gt;Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2001): „Tarnung oder Opportunismus? Der Berliner Museumsethnologe Kunz Dittmer im Nationalsozialismus“, in: Berliner Blätter, Ethnographische und ethnologische Beiträge, 22, Pg. 31-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel Folklore Museums in East and West (1945-1989)===
Although the most valuable items of the museums’ collection were evacuated to nine different places in [[Berlin]], [[Brandenburg]], and [[Vorpommern]] in the last years of the war, around 80% of the collection was destroyed. The objects from the Berlin Flak Tower at the Zoo that were brought to [[Thuringia]] were carried from US garrisons back to Wiesbaden. The Soviet occupying forces transported the objects that remained at the flak tower as well as other valuable museum goods back to the Soviet Union in the summer of 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Karasek, Erika (2010): „Vom Museum für Deutsche Volkskunde zum Museum Europäischer Kulturen“, in: Akteure, Praxen, Theorien. Der Ethnografin Ute Mohrmann zum siebzigsten Geburtstag, Berliner Blätter, Book 52, Pg. 38-46, Pg. 38f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political separation of post-war Germany led to the foundation of two parallel museums in Berlin: a part of the collection was housed in the “Museum für Volkskunde” (Museum for Folklore) in the [[Pergamon Museum]] on the Museum Island, where after contextual-conceptual controversy it finally established itself with a new public collection. The other part in West Berlin was shortly affiliated with the Museum for Ethnology, but won its autonomy in the framework of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation as the “Museum für Deutsche Volkskunde” (Museum for German Folklore) in 1963. Even so, it was first in 1976 when the museum moved to the reopened warehouse wing of the [[Prussian Privy State Archives]] in Berlin-Dahlem that it was accessible to the public. A ministerial dictate that forbid employees of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (East) to have contact with institutions of the Preußischen Kulturbesitzes in Berlin (West) was a crucial factor to the estrangement of both institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Karasek 1989, Pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s both museums increasingly dedicated themselves to the cultural change from the industrial era right up to the life of the city dweller. With special exhibitions like “Großstadtproletariat” (Big City Proletariat) (1980–87) or “Dienstbare Geister” (Willing Hands) (1981) the museums were able to overcome the confinements of the pre-industrial country and farm culture. The aspiration of the collection-politic to direct itself to modern dynamics was only partly fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Tietmeyer, Elisabeth (2003), Pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt; After the cooperation between the European Department of the Museum for Ethnology and the Museum for German Folklore, the idea came about in 1988 to found a “European Museum” as a reaction to the social and cultural processes of change as part of the advanced political and economical European integration.&lt;ref&gt;Karasek 2010, Pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

During the celebrations for the 100-year anniversary in 1989 of the Museums for (German) Folklore the latent contact between the two museums began to revive.

===Museum for Folklore by the National Museums in Berlin /Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation===

In connect to the political reunification of Germany the collections of the State Museums were brought together with the support of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. As part of the new orientation the separated museum inventories we initially unified into the “Museum für Volkskunde bei den Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin/Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz” (Museum for Folklore by the National Museums in Berlin /Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation). This complex organizational challenge triggered a wave of controversial contentual/conceptual discussions that entailed reconciling and compromising in regards to the prospective structure of the museum. The original idea from the Museum for Ethnology at the end of the 1980s for a new concept of a museum with a European direction was elaborated: the Europe Department and the Museum for Folklore would be consolidated into one new museum.&lt;ref&gt;Karasek 2010, Pg. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum of European Cultures===
As a result, the Museum of European Cultures, with its new programmatic direction, was founded in 1999. This new founding took into account the present societal, political, and cultural developments in Europe. The Museum explored historical, cultural, and nationalistic borders between the “us” and the purportedly foreign “them”. The museum also documented and collected, within European context, international exchange processes of the every day life of European societies and its accompanying changes. At the same time the museum busies itself with issues of the plural society in Germany, such as migrant movements, cultural diversity, its expression and societal effects, especially in urban settings.

The museum moved its exhibits to the [[Dahlem Museums]] in 2011 in the Bruno-Paul Building in Arnimallee 25. The workshops, warehouse, and employee offices can still be found in the old exhibit rooms on Im Winkel 6/8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5656">[[File:ARtDeco55.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Musée des Arts Décoratifs at the Louvre]]
'''Musée des Arts Décoratifs''' (Museum of Decorative Arts), a [[museum]] of the [[decorative arts]] and [[design]], located in the [[Palais du Louvre]]'s western wing, known as the Pavillon de Marsan, at 107 rue de Rivoli, in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris]], [[France]]. It is one of three museum locations of [[Les Arts Décoratifs]].

The museum also hosts exhibitions of [[fashion]], [[advertising]] and [[graphic arts]] from its collections from the formerly separate but now defunct [[Musée de la Publicité]] and [[Musée de la mode et du textile]].

==Displays==

The museum collection was founded in 1905 by members of the Union des Arts Décoratifs. The architect was [[Gaston Redon]].  It houses and displays furniture, interior design, altarpieces, religious paintings, ''objets d'arts'', tapestries, wallpaper, ceramics and glassware, plus toys from the [[Middle Ages]] to the present day.

The collection is primarily composed of French furniture, tableware, carpets such as those from [[Aubusson, Creuse|Aubusson]], porcelain such as that by the [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]], and a large number of glass pieces  by [[René Lalique]], [[Émile Gallé]] and many others. It includes numerous works in the [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Déco]] styles and modern examples by designers like [[Eileen Gray]] and [[Charlotte Perriand]]. However, the museum's deep holdings range back to 13th-century [[Europe]].

Of interest to the public are the period rooms. Examples include part of [[Jeanne Lanvin]]'s house (decorated by [[Albert-Armand Rateau]] [1884–1938] in the early 1920s) at 16 rue Barbet-de-Jouy in Paris. Others are graphic artist [[Eugène Grasset]]'s dining room of 1880, and the 1752 Gold Cabinet of [[Avignon]]. And, peculiar to a French museum it seems, there is the 1875 bedroom of courtesan Lucie Émilie Delabigne, purportedly the inspiration for the main character in [[Émile Zola]]'s novel ''Nana'' (1880).

There is a distinctive ceiling there once owned by [[Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes]], mistress of then [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|duke of Savoy]].

==Exhibitions==
Some of the museum's vast number of exhibitions have been distinguished. Yvonne Brunhammer, a curator and then director of the museum for over four decades from the early 1950s and the person who rediscovered Eileen Gray, organized the 1966 exhibition, "Les Années '25': Art Déco/[[Bauhaus]]/Stijl Esprit Nouveau". The exhibition served to coin "Art Déco", the term that came to describe design between the World Wars, particularly French modern design.

The museum is somewhat on a par with similar and venerable decorative-arts and design-focused institutions such as the more international [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in [[London]] and was the inspiration for the Hewitt sisters' collection in the [[Cooper Union]] (the ancestor of the no-longer-affiliated [[Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum]]) in [[New York City]]. However, due to a large number of fine-art, publicity, fashion and design exhibitions mounted at the Paris museum, its focus has been diluted and caused its name, Musée des "Art Decoratifs", to be a misnomer. Thus, its name for popular use became MAD (mode, arts, design or, in English, fashion, arts, design) in January 2016&lt;ref https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/arts/an-old-paris-museum-makes-a-new-name-for-itself.html&lt;/ref&gt;, even though the acronym is the same as MAD (Museum of Arts and Design) in New York City.

==Renovation==
The Musée des Arts Décoratifs was closed from 1996 due to a renovation of the building and of about 6,000 works from the collection; the renovation cost €35 million (about $45 million in 2006). The museum reopened on September 15, 2006. Béatrice Salmon, the current director and overseer of the restoration, has called the collection "the history of French taste and of the decorative arts and design in France" and has suggested: "People [in France] understand how to relate to paintings and sculpture in a museum, but they don't know how to interpret objects"&lt;ref https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/03/style/03iht-design4.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Pierre-Alexis Dumas]], a principal of [[Hermès]] International and the president of the Fondation Hermès, was elected president in 2015. He succeeded Bruno Roger.

===Archives on public display===
On September 17, 2009 the National Geographic Image Collection opened its first exhibition of vintage National Geographic images at the [http://www.stevenkasher.com/html/home.asp Steven Kasher Gallery ] in [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/arts/design/19geographic.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=kasher&amp;st=cse Randy Kennedy, "Treasures From an Underground Trove", New York Times August 18, 2009 ]''&lt;/ref&gt;  150 vintage prints, many of which were never published in National Geographic Magazine, from a dozen photographers, were on display.  The images, which make up a collective portrait of the Society’s early years, are stored in a {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} windowless, [[Climate control|climate-controlled]], underground archive with roots reaching back more than a century.

The National Geographic Image Collection archive also includes glass-plate negatives and [[Autochrome Lumière|auto chromes]], the earliest examples of color photography.

'''''Orang-Outang, sive Homo Sylvestris: or, the Anatomy of a Pygmie Compared with that of a Monkey, an Ape, and a Man''''' (1699) is a book by the British scientist [[Edward Tyson]]. Regarded as a seminal work on anatomy, this volume led to Tyson being known as the father of [[comparative anatomy]]. The book characterizes in detail the anatomy of a creature described as a ''pygmy'' (later known as a [[chimpanzee]]) and contains Tyson's views on the [[phylogeny]] of the pygmy and its relationship to humans, apes, and monkeys.

[[File:Anatomy of a pygmy.jpg|thumb|Title page of ''Anatomy of a Pygmy'']]

The use of the phrase "orang-outang" does not refer to members of the [[orangutan]] genus ''Pongo'', but rather uses the phrase to refer to the habitat of the subject; that is, a "person of the forest" (''orangutan'' translates from Malay as "person of the forest/jungle".&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web| title = Orangutan | url = http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/orangutan.html| publisher = [[National Geographic Society]] |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Due to the absence of previous literature concerning chimpanzees, it is not clear whether or not the titular subject was a [[bonobo]], ''Pan paniscus'', or a [[common chimpanzee]], ''Pan troglodytes'', as there was not great prior distinction between the two. Following his summary of the anatomy of the subject, Tyson attaches fours essays concerning the ancients' knowledge of [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pygmies]], [[cynocephali]], [[satyr]]s, and [[sphinges]].

The book was originally published in 1699 and was republished in 1894 with an introduction which contains a biography of Edward Tyson by Bertram C. A. Windle. Large portions of the book are block quotations in Latin of works from antiquity regarding the anatomy and socialization of the pygmy, much of which Tyson regarded as inaccurate myths and hearsay.

==Letter of dedication==
The letter of dedication is addressed to John Sommers, a Lord High Chancellor of England and President of the [[Royal Society]]. The letter thanks him for his dedication to the advancement of knowledge, specifically "experimental natural philosophy".

==Preface==
The preface consists of Tyson giving his reasons for conducting the study, "to find out the truth, than to enlarge in the mythology; to inform the judgement, than to please the fancy". He also laments his inability to compare his findings directly to apes and monkeys, instead having to rely on the works of others, such as [[Aristotle]], [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], [[Galen]], and [[Vesalius]]. Lastly he apologizes in advance for any mistakes on his part within the book.

==Organization==
The book itself is roughly divided into three parts containing Tyson's findings from his dissection of the pygmy and his comparison to previous findings, many of which are in Latin or Greek.

===Overview===
Tyson summarizes his observations on the external and internal anatomy of the pygmy, making note of their similarity or differences to humans. Most often he finds that the pygmy is different and "inferior" to humans, which is typical of the anthropocentrism of the time. Much of the text where he addresses previous findings are in Latin or Greek, although he does give explanations for why these authors' drew the conclusions they did, and why they are different or similar from his, in English.

===Skeleton===
This section is further subdivided into five sections, with much of the text being in Latin or Greek.

===Muscles===
This section is not divided, but addresses the musculature of the pygmy from head to feet.

===Synopsis===
Here Tyson gives the reader two lists, the first how the pygmy is more like a man than an ape, and the second how the pygmy is more like an ape than a man.

====Similarities====
A list of features Tyson found present in the pygmy which are more similar to a human than to an ape or a monkey; the terms use modern, common, anatomical terms which may differ from what is found in the book, but have been changed to ease the readers' understanding.

# Similar hair morphology of the shoulder and arm.
# Similar facial structure: forehead larger than the chin.
# The shape of the outer ear, except that the cartilage is thinner and more like an ape.
# Thicker fingers than an ape has.
# Primarily bipedal.
# Larger buttocks than an ape.
# Calf muscles.
# Wider in the shoulders and pectorals.
# Longer heel.
# Adipose membrane next to the skin.
# Unperforated peritoneum in the groin.
# Longer small intestine.
# Larger intestinal canal.
# Presence of a vermiform appendix;  beginning of the colon is not extended.
# Insertion of the bile and pancreatic ducts are in the same location. The ape also has this same location, but not a monkey.
# Longer large intestine.
# The liver is not divided into lobes (which humans do have; this differs from modern anatomical understanding).
# Similar bile vessels.
# Same spleen.
# Same pancreas.
# Same number of lobes in each lung.
# Pericardium attached to diaphragm.
# More rounded apex of the heart.
# No pouches in the chaps (unclear).
# Much larger brain than in apes, with the same structures as a human brain.
# More globular skull; twice as big as an ape's or monkey's.
# Same number of cranial sutures. Wormian (intra-sutural) bones also present (though not present in all humans).
# Cribriform plate and crista galli are present (present also in apes but not monkeys).
# Sella turcica is less prominent than in apes and monkeys.
# Pterygoid process present.
# Temporal and anterior fontanelle are different in monkeys (but not in apes).
# Zygomatic bone more similar to humans (smaller than in monkeys and apes).
# Shape of the teeth, especially the canines and molars.
# Transverse apophysis of C6 and C7 vertebra are more like a human's.
# Cervical vertebra lack foramen for containing the nerves (not the spinal cord, but rather peripheral nerves which travel to the rest of the body) which are present in monkeys.
# Number of thoracic and lumbar apophyses.
# Five vertebrae in the loins (could refer to lumbar vertebrae, of which monkey and apes have six).
# Lumbar vertebrae are straight.
# Five sacral elements; three in apes and monkeys.
# Four unperforated segments of the coccyx; monkeys have more.
# Seven true ribs which articulate in the body of the vertebrae; in apes and monkeys there are eight which articulate in the interstices of the vertebrae.
# Broad sternum; narrow in monkeys.
# Larger phalanges than in apes.
# Femur articulates and is shaped more like a human's.
# Round, single patella, not long and double like in an ape.
# Same heel, tarsals, and metatarsals as a human.
# Middle toe is not the longest, as it is in apes and monkeys.
# The obliquus capitis inferior, pyriformis, and biceps femoris are a human's. All other muscles are like the human's as well, but are not distinguishably different from an ape or monkey the same, either from lack of subject or previous observations.

====Differences====
A list of features Tyson found were more similar between the pygmy and the ape and monkey, and less similar to a human.
# Stature.
# Flat nose.

# Eye orbit protrudes inward, toward the brain.
# Lack of cavities beneath the sella turcica.
# The mastoid and styloid processes are very small, almost absent.

# Number of teeth.
# Short, flat-front cervical vertebra without bifide spines.
# No spine in the fifth cervical vertebra.
# Number of thoracic vertebra: twelve in man, ten in apes, thirteen in a pygmy.
# Same number of vertebra or elements in the sacrum as an ape.
# Thirteen ribs on each side; humans have twelve.
# Smaller thumb bones than humans have.
# The ilium is exactly like an ape's, that is longer, narrower, and less concave than a man's.
# Length of the bones of the toes; the great toe is opposable like an ape's.
# Lack of occipitalis, frontalis, dilator naris, levator labii superioris, interspinales cervicis, gluteus minimus, extensor digitorum pedi brevis, and transversalis pedi.
# Lack of pyramidales, palmaris longus, attollens auriculum, and retrains auriculum.
# Levator claviculae are present (absent in humans).
# Longus colli, pectoralis, latissimus dorsi, gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, psoas major, psoas minor, iliacus internus, and the gastrocnemius internalis are more similar to apes and monkeys than humans.

{{Main article| Denis Gifford}}

''In addition to published work on cinema, this article also includes Denis Gifford's film credits.''

Denis Gifford provided one of the earliest researched archives of early cinema, with [[The British Film Catalogue|''The British Film Catalogue, 1895–1970'']], and produced numerous authoritative works on previously uncatalogued films from the UK and the US. Gifford had a particular interest in early horror and science fiction, and early comedy including [[Laurel and Hardy]].

==Articles and interviews on cinema==
Gifford's involvement in cinema fanzines dates back to the early 1950s, and he continued to write for the fan press well into the 1980s, long after he was well established in large circulation magazines such as ''House of Hammer''. Gifford also conducted a large number of recorded interviews with of vintage showbusiness figures, including actors and filmmakers, intended for personal reference. Many of these are now kept as an archive by the BFI.

[[File:Columbia University Rare Book and Manuscript Library.jpg|thumb]]
'''Columbia University's Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library''' is located on the 6th Floor of [[Columbia University]]'s [[Butler Library]].  The library holds the special collections of Columbia University, as well as the Columbia University Archives.  The range of the library's holdings spans more than 4,000 years, from cylinder seals created in Mesopotamia to contemporary artists' books. In addition to printed and manuscript resources, the library contains [[cuneiform]] tablets, [[papyri]], [[ostraca]], astronomical and [[mathematical instrument]]s, maps, works of art, photographs, posters, early printing presses and papermaking equipment, type specimens, sound and moving image recordings, theater set models, puppets, masks, ephemera and memorabilia. The Rare Book and Manuscript Library includes unique and rare materials related to all subject areas.

==History==
The history of the rare book and manuscript collections dates from the founding of King's College, now Columbia University, in 1754.  The library holds materials related to both the first and third presidents of the University, Samuel Johnson and his son [[William Samuel Johnson]], donated by the family in 1914.  In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the University acquired significant materials though gifts from Stephen Whitney Phoenix, [[Richard J. H. Gottheil]], [[Brander Matthews]], [[Robert H. Montgomery]], [[David Eugene Smith]], and [[George Plimpton]].  These gifts included medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, materials related to the history of accountancy, education, and mathematics, and the Dramatic Museum collections.  The University’s first major collection purchase was Professor [[Edwin R. A. Seligman]]’s library on the history of economics in 1929.  This purchase, and the creation of the Friends of the Libraries Group in the late 1920s, was the impetus for growth in the 1930s.  The University moved to make provisions for the care of these types of materials, and the Trustees allowed for the establishment of the Rare Book Department on July 1, 1930.  By the end of the 1930s, the library was housed on the sixth floor of Butler Library.  As the library increased its collecting of archives and manuscripts, the name of the division was changed from the Rare Book Department to the Department of Special Collections in 1946.  Its current name was adopted in 1975.

Although many of these collections contained significant manuscripts, the collecting of manuscripts and archives in their own right took on greater importance after World War II.  The library acquired several significant manuscript collections in the 1930s and 1940s, including those of editor [[Park Benjamin]] and author [[Stephen Crane]].  This work continued into the 1950s, during which time the library acquired significant collections related to American history and diplomacy, including those of [[John Jay]].  Over the years, the library has acquired archival materials in several key collecting areas—economics and banking, graphic arts, history, human rights, literature, performing arts, printing history, and publishing.  In addition, the library includes a number of separately curated archival units, such as the '''Carnegie Philanthropy Collections''', the '''Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European Culture''' (named for [[Boris Bakhmeteff]]), and the '''[[Herbert H. Lehman]] American History Collections'''.

==Holdings==
The library’s collections are particularly strong in English and American history and literature, children's literature, economics and banking, education, graphic arts, human rights, journalism history, librarianship, mathematics and astronomy, New York City politics, philanthropy, printing history, social welfare and social work, theater history, and the performing arts.

==Units==
The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library has eleven units:
*Bakhmeteff Archive of Russian and East European Culture, preserves and documents the heritage of Russian and East European émigrés.
*Carnegie Collections, the repository for the records of four philanthropic organizations founded and endowed by the Scottish steel magnate Andrew Carnegie.
*Center for Human Rights Documentation and Research, which currently includes the records of several human rights NGOs.
*Herbert H. Lehman Collections, include both Lehman’s papers and other related collections.
*John Jay Papers Project, is a publication project for [[The Selected Papers of John Jay]]
*Manuscripts, Papers, and Records; the University’s principal repository for primary resources.
*Medieval and Renaissance Manuscripts
*Oral History Research Office
*Papyri and Ostraca
*Rare Books, cares for printed books, ancient writing surfaces, other codex manuscripts, art, and ephemera.
*University Archives

===Columbia University Archives===
These are located within the Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library on the 6th floor of [[Butler Library]]; they collect, preserve, and make available for research the administrative records of Columbia University, as well as personal papers, publications, and memorabilia related to the University’s history. 

Archival holdings date from the 18th through the early 21st centuries and document the evolution of University governance and administration; the history and development of individual schools, colleges, and academic departments; the professionalization of higher education and the development of academic disciplines; curriculum development, including the formation of the Core Curriculum; the careers of noteworthy faculty and officers; the design and construction of the Morningside campus; and the University’s relationships with city, state, and federal governments. Administrative records available for research in 2007 are those that were created prior to 1982. In addition the UA retains University publications from bulletins to yearbooks; a library of books and pamphlets on Columbia’s history; scrapbooks and memorabilia; in excess of 60,000 images, as well as some 50,000 negatives (both glass plate and film); a collection of lantern slides; and biographical information on students, faculty, and alumni.

'''''Relic''''' is a 1995 novel by American authors [[Douglas Preston]] and [[Lincoln Child]], and the first in the Special Agent Pendergast series.  As a [[techno-thriller]], it comments on the possibilities inherent in [[Genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], and is critical of [[museum]]s and their role both in society and in the scientific community.  It is the basis of the film ''[[The Relic (film)|The Relic]]'' (1997).

==Plot==

In September 1987, Dr. Julian Whittlesey is leading an expedition through the [[Amazon Basin]], in the [[Brazil]]ian [[rainforest]], in search of the lost Kothoga tribe. He hopes to prove that they still do exist and in the process learn more about their culture, including their [[lizard]] god Mbwun ("He Who Walks On All Fours"), supposedly the son of [[Satan]]. However, Whittlesey disappears after finding the mutilated body of his partner, Crocker, and realizes that a creature in [[the bush]] is stalking him. A year later, in [[Belem]], a dock worker named Ven is suddenly and brutally killed when a freighter arrives with a shipment of crates from Whittlesey's expedition.

Seven years later, in a fictionalized version of [[New York City]]'s [[American Museum of Natural History]], two young boys are found dead in a museum stairwell, having gotten lost in the late hours of the museum. [[New York Police Department|NYPD]] Lieutenant [[Vincent D'Agosta]] leads the subsequent investigation. He has the museum under tight lockdown and its staff placed under curfew, for fear the murderer is still hiding somewhere in the museum or the many catacombs that run underneath it. The three prominent leaders of the museum - curator Winston Wright, deputy head Ian Cuthbert, and public relations director Lavinia Rickman - all try to keep the murders under wraps, as the grand gala opening of the new "Superstition" exhibition, led by George Moriarty, draws nearer, an event that will feature many wealthy benefactors as well as Mayor Harper. Rickman even hires ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter Bill Smithback, Jr. to cover the murder investigation but repeatedly edits his reports so they will appear more favorable towards the museum and its leadership. Assistant Curator Gregory Kawakita jokingly begins spreading the rumor of the "Museum Beast", a legendary monster that has allegedly been roaming the tunnels under the museum for years and is responsible for the murders. Although the rumors are initially dismissed as myth, D'Agosta is shocked during the autopsy to discover a claw buried in one of the boy's brains.

When a security guard suffers a similarly brutal death, [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] Special Agent [[Aloysius Pendergast]] arrives to aid in the investigation, having taken a personal interest in the unique nature of the kills. The investigation intensifies as the gala draws nearer, with the search spreading to the tunnels under the museum. Dr. Margo Green and her mentor, Dr. Whitney Frock, initially take little to no interest in the investigation, but Pendergast eventually approaches them when he realizes the claw from the autopsy matches the claws on a Mbwun figurine that had been sent back to the museum in a crate in 1987 and is set to be put on display in the new exhibition. Green, with Smithback's help, manages to get into the secure vault and gain access to some letters that Whittlesey had sent to a museum colleague named H.C. Montague, detailing the struggles the 1987 expedition had been going through. Pendergast then reveals the primary reason for his interest in the case: the nature of the murders of the two boys and the security guard matches the murder of the Brazilian dock worker in 1988, as well as several other dock workers in Louisiana later that year. Pendergast was able to trace back to the one connection among the museum murders, the Louisiana murder, and the Belem murder: the shipment of crates Whittlesey had sent the museum in 1987. However, other than one smaller crate containing the Mbwun figurine, the crates were empty, save massive quantities of local plant leaves apparently used as packaging. Frock reveals that those crates have been moved into the heavily reinforced secure vault as well, and after Green and Smithback's stunt to get the letters, the directors are well aware of their intentions and will never allow them access to the crates. Pendergast hints at the possibility that the murders might not have been committed by a human, and that the Mbwun monster may somehow have been sent to the museum by Whittlesey's shipment.

Reading through more of Whittlesey's letters, Green and Smithback discover one other major colleague of Whittlesey's who is still working at the museum, and to whom one of the letters was addressed, Dr. Jorgensen. They ask Jorgensen about the nature of the expedition and its aftermath. Jorgensen explains that Whittlesey was determined to prove that the Kothoga tribe had not gone extinct, and that he had found it at long last on a ''tepui'' deep in the Brazilian jungle. In addition, Whittlesey had apparently discovered a unique plant at the base of the ''tepui'' that had some kind of protein-like quality to it. However, Whittlesey was being accompanied by a museum bureaucrat simply identified as "Maxwell", whose job was to hinder Whittlesey's progress so that the find would not collide with the local government's discovery of an undisclosed natural resource that had been discovered on the ''tepui''. Determined to mine the entire area, the government dropped [[napalm]] on the ''tepui'' in 1988, killing all of the remaining Kothoga and destroying the plant. Jorgensen also reveals that Whittlesey's colleague Montague had disappeared rather suddenly several years ago. Green and Frock soon realize that the plant Whittlesey discovered was the same plant that had been sent back as packaging in the crates, and that Whittlesey had never sent the crates back to the museum empty; that the main content of the crates was the plant itself. The day of the gala, Green and Frock then begin running computer analyses on samples of the plant as well as the claw from the autopsy. The results reveal that the plants are rich in thalamoid hormones, which can also be found in the human [[hypothalamus]] gland, though to a much lesser extent. After reviewing the autopsy reports, Green realizes that what all of the murders - in the museum and in Louisiana and Brazil - all had in common was that the hypothalamus had been ripped out of the victim's heads and was completely missing. The analysis of the claw creates a general caricature of the creature in the question, comprising a primary mix of primate, reptile, and human genes; a nocturnal nature; a strong sense of smell; a quadruped build; a maximum speed of 60-70 KPH; and thick muscle definition and bone structure. Frock describes this hypothetical combination as having the strength of a grizzly bear, the speed of a greyhound, and the intelligence of a human being - the ultimate predator. Frock and Green finally discover the truth behind the entire ordeal, but their efforts to warn their superiors before the gala are thwarted.

As the investigation ultimately did not produce a suspect, the gala is allowed to begin, with a tightened security presence by the NYPD and the FBI, under the official command of Special Agent Coffey. The exhibition initially appears to be going fine until the body of NYPD officer Fred Beauregard drops down from the rafters above the exhibition and right into the crowd, causing a mass panic. At the same time, an NYPD officer named Waters, assigned to monitor the museum's security control room, hears a strange noise in the generator room (revealed to be merely the air conditioner pump) and opens fire, only to completely destroy the central switching box and shut down the museum's power. This results in the museum's massive, metal security doors automatically closing, separating the museum into five cells and trapping a handful of guests, staff, and security personnel alike inside the museum. When the chaos settles, dozens of people have either been killed by the stampeding crowd or crushed by the closing doors, and the roughly three-dozen who are trapped inside the area where the exhibition is includes D'Agosta, Smithback, Cuthbert, Wright, Rickman, Mayor Harper, museum security director Ippolito, and NYPD officer John Bailey. Coffey and Kawakita manage to make it outside the museum, while Green, Frock, and Pendergast are all in the tunnels under the museum, and all three soon encounter the creature. Pendergast manages to fire a single shot, which simply bounces off the creature's skull.

Pendergast manages to communicate with D'Agosta via radio, to warn him about the creature, and explains that the best way for the trapped crowd to escape is down through the museum tunnels, which eventually lead to the sewer systems of New York. The three directors refuse to head down into the tunnels, and instead retreat into Wright's office on the fourth floor. Just as D'Agosta prepares to lead the crowd down the first stairwell, the creature attacks and kills Ippolito and an injured guest. The rest of the crowd manages to escape down into the tunnels. Although extremely skeptical of the consistent reports of a creature's being responsible, Coffey eventually orders a SWAT team to descend into the museum through the skylights, to eliminate the creature. The Mbwun then enters the office where the three directors are hiding, and Cuthbert sends Rickman and a now-drunk Wright into the adjacent dinosaur area to safety, while he draws a pistol to make a stand. However, the creature suddenly leaves him alone and pursues the other two, killing both of them. Cuthbert is rescued by the SWAT team shortly before they move in to attack the creature, only for the entire team to be slaughtered.

The crowd manages to navigate the tunnels and reaches the sewers just before the creature returns, killing Bailey. They then reach a massive underground chamber that is filled with skeletons and torn meat, presumably the creature's lair. They struggle to stay above the rising water as the storm outside intensifies, and another woman is dragged away by the current and dies, shortly before the crowd finally reaches a manhole and escapes back out onto the streets of New York. Pendergast and Green devise a plan to make a final stand against the creature, with Pendergast hoping to use his old hunting techniques of shooting the creature's legs in order to stop its charge. However, the shots do not penetrate the hide, and the creature closes in. At the last second, Green shouts for Pendergast to shoot through the creature's eye, allowing the bullet to pass straight through the skull and into the brain, which kills it instantly.

In the epilogue four weeks later, Green, Frock, Kawakita, Pendergast, D'Agosta, and Smithback all convene in Frock's office to discuss the events of that night. Pendergast explains everything in great detail: the Kothoga legend claimed that Mbwun was given to them by Satan in order to slay their enemies in battle, when in actuality, the Kothoga created the Mbwun by feeding a human the strange plant that Whittlesey had discovered and shipped back to the museum. Eating the plant resulted in the human subject's undergoing the transformation process into the creature known as Mbwun, larger, faster, stronger, and slightly smarter. However, the Mbwun subsequently needed a consistent supply of the plant in order to survive, like an addictive drug. When the ''tepui'' where the Kothoga and Mbwun lived was completely destroyed, the Mbwun knew the last surviving samples of the plant were in the crates Whittlesey had shipped back, and thus, it followed the crates all the way to New York. It initially lived off the plants in a steady ration for years, and in the process, killed Montague one day when he came down to investigate the crates. Montague's disappearance was marked by a puddle of blood by the crates, but when it was discovered by Cuthbert, Wright, and Rickman, they washed it away to preserve the museum's reputation. As part of the cover-up, the crates were moved into the heavily fortified vault, moving them permanently out of the Mbwun's reach. Thus, in order to stay alive, it needed the next best substitute: the human hypothalamus. Though it tried its best to keep its existence a secret by living off smaller animals and homeless individuals in the sewers, it eventually turned to the murders of the boys and the security guard. Even during the police investigation, it could no longer deny its appetite, and thus ran amok during the exhibition. Pendergast also reveals that, among the bodies that were found in the lair were the remains of Moriarty and a pendant that Whittlesey had always worn on him, serving as proof that the creature killed both of them. Cuthbert has since been institutionalized, Coffey was demoted and sent to the [[Waco]] field office, and Smithback reveals that he will release a book on the entire event, with half of the money going to a memorial fund for the late Bailey and his family.

In his lab, Kawakita has realized an horrific truth; the creature didn't kill Whittlesey and take his pendant as a trophy, it actually WAS Whittlesey. He speculates that the Kothoga, having failed with Mbwun using their own people, had decided to feed the plant to a white man instead, hoping the resulting creature would be easier to control. The gamble failed, and Whittlesey was able to survive on the plants for years before their destruction, and he followed his own samples back home to the museum. Thanks to the samples that survived and were analyzed, Kawakita manages to develop a drug that would turn the users into addicts first, then into Mbwun. He begins selling it on the street, reflecting that the Kothoga's problem had been that Mbwun was able to feed on the plants himself whenever he wanted, and so they had no hold over it. Now, as the only person alive capable of making the drug, the creatures would never turn on him; he would have total control over the creatures and succeed where the Kothoga failed.

== Film adaptation ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:The Relic cover.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''The Relic'' movie poster]] --&gt;
{{main article|The Relic (film)|l1=The Relic (film)}}
A [[film]] based on the book was released in 1997, but changed several aspects of the story, omitting numerous characters and changing the setting to the [[Chicago Museum of Natural History]] rather than the New York Museum of Natural History (fictional but strongly based on the [[American Museum of Natural History]]).  The film was directed by [[Peter Hyams]] and stars [[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Dr. Margo Green, [[Tom Sizemore]] as Lt. Vincent D'Agosta, and [[Linda Hunt]] as Dr. Ann Cuthbert.

=== Changes from the novel ===
The film gives away key plot points throughout its duration of the film; in contrast, in the novel, the explanation is delivered in the last few pages, giving the book a [[twist ending]]. The movie has a similar twist during its climax. The following table details additional changes.

{|class="wikitable"
|- bgcolor="White"
| '''Name'''
| '''Character description from the novel'''
| '''Character description from the film'''
|-
| Margo Green
| Is described as an introverted graduate student. Had an indirect role in the killing of the creature by assisting [[Agent Pendergast|Pendergast]].
| Is a Doctor of evolutionary biology.  Is brownish blonde, feisty, and assertive. In addition, she kills the creature. Played by [[Penelope Ann Miller]]
|-
| Lt. Vincent D’Agosta
| Described as overweight, and approaching early middle age; disdainful of [[superstition]]s
| Is younger and more athletic. Also extremely superstitious. Played by [[Tom Sizemore]].
|-
| Dr. Frock
| Survives by hiding in an office in his wheelchair while Margo and Pendergast run on ahead to get to a place where they are able to kill the creature.
| Is slain by the creature; character is played by  [[James Whitmore]].
|-
| Dr. Ian Cuthbert
| Survives a close encounter with the monster, at the expense of his sanity, his boss, and his public relations director.
| Changed to a female character, Dr. Ann Cuthbert, played by actress [[Linda Hunt]].
|-
| Gregory Kawakita
| An intellectual loner, prefers to research on his own. Born in [[Japan]], raised in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. It is shown in the epilogue that he figured out the origins of the creature.
| Is renamed Greg Lee; he is a Chinese-American and is depicted as obsequious and underhanded. He is played by [[Chi Moui Lo]]. Is killed by the monster.
|-
| [[Agent Pendergast]]
| Smooth-talking, urbane, and extremely clever [[FBI]] Agent from [[New Orleans]]
| He is completely written out; his role is combined with Lt. Vincent D’Agosta.
|-
| William "Bill" Smithback
| Entertaining but nosy journalist writing a book for the museum's "Superstition" exhibit; friend of Margo Green. Helps D'Agosta get a group of guests, including the [[Mayor]] of [[New York City]], out of the Museum.
| Completely cut from film, no replacement.
|-
| The Museum Monster
| Named "Mbwun" (translation: "He Who Walks On All Fours"). It is worth noting that this translation matches the Navajo name for a [[Skinwalker#Navajo skinwalker: the yee naldlooshi|Skinwalker (yee naaldlooshii)]] or, "With it, He goes on all fours." Description, at best, is a "scaly primate." Characterized by an unusual smell and glowing red eyes. The [[DNA]] of this creature includes [[gecko]] genes. Is described as being "as fast as a [[greyhound]] with the intelligence of a [[human]]." Was much stealthier than its movie counterpart. Received more sympathy in the novel; both Margo and Ian Cuthbert described it as "lonely" and "sad." Used to be archaeologist Julian Whittlesey.  Transformation time may have been the same, but the time from arrival in [[New York City|New York]] to killing humans is measured in years rather than weeks, and begins with small animals. There is some evidence of the monster retained some sentimental feelings of his human life.  The packing crate that contained the Mbwun plant the monster needed was stored for a time at the museum and allowed the monster to survive without killing.  Only after the crate and dried plants were moved beyond its reach did it turn to killing.
The creature's skull and hide were durable enough that bullets fired at its head were deflected.  It is finally killed by Agent Pendergast, who shoots it through its eye socket with a large caliber handgun.
| Named "Kothoga" (the name was used for the tribe worshipping/creating Mbwun in the novel). Is more massive and somewhat insect-like, it has large mandibles sprouting form the side of its face, similar to a [[stag beetle]], resembles a reptilian [[tiger]] and walks and runs like a big cat. It had a hairy spine and a forked tongue, with long and curvy sharp teeth, it also has a long and flexible reptillian tail. Instead of red, its eyes are green. There was also very little sympathy towards it. Used to be archaeologist John Whitney, and it has subtle human features as it has wide shoulders, and a human like forehead.  Began killing humans almost immediately upon arrival in [[Chicago]] and actually killed the crew of the ship that brought it to the city.  The crate containing the plant was destroyed almost immediately upon arrival in the museum in Chicago as a precaution against possible biohazard.

NOTE: Actually, there are ''two'' museum monsters in the movie; the other is a bug which eats the Kothoga plant and, as a result, becomes a massive and hideous exaggeration of itself. Margo crushes it to death with a biochemistry textbook.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Plot summaries must remain between 400-700 words --&gt;
Marty is a struggling writer who dreams of finishing his screenplay, ''Seven Psychopaths''. Marty's best friend, Billy, makes a living by kidnapping dogs and collecting the owners' rewards for their safe return. Billy's partner-in-crime is Hans, a religious man with a cancer-stricken wife, Myra.

Marty writes a story for another psychopath, the "Quaker", who stalks his daughter's killer for decades, driving the killer to suicide. Billy suggests Marty use the "Jack of Diamonds" killer, perpetrator of a recent double murder, as one of the psychopaths. Billy places an advertisement in the newspaper inviting psychopaths to call and share their stories for Marty to use in his script. A man named Zachariah Rigby approaches Marty and shares his story, with the condition that the movie include a message to his partner in crime.

Billy and Hans steal a [[Shih Tzu]] named Bonny, unaware that it is the beloved pet of Charlie Costello, an unpredictable and violent gangster. Charlie's thugs, led by Paulo, discover Hans' connection to the kidnapping. They threaten to kill Marty and Hans, but the Jack of Diamonds killer arrives and kills the thugs. Charlie traces Myra to the cancer ward and kills her after she refuses to tell him anything.

Billy goes to Costello's house to meet his girlfriend, Angela, who is also Charlie's girlfriend. After Billy reveals to her that he kidnapped Bonny, she calls Charlie to tell him. Billy, after finding out that Charlie killed Myra, shoots Angela in retaliation. Charlie arrives at Billy's address and discovers many packs of playing cards with the jack of diamonds missing, and realizes Billy is the "Jack of Diamonds" killer.

Marty, Billy, and Hans leave the city with Bonny. Hans reveals that he was the Quaker. Marty wrote his story after hearing it from a drunken Billy. The trio drive into the desert and set up camp. Billy suggests ''Seven Psychopaths'' end with a shootout between the psychopaths and Charlie's forces.

Marty and Hans see a headline saying that Billy is wanted in connection with the Jack of Diamonds killings. Marty confronts Billy, who reveals that he assumed the Jack of Diamonds persona to give Marty inspiration. Marty tells Billy they must go home. Meanwhile, Hans has a vision of Myra in which she is in a "grey place," leading Hans to question his belief in the [[afterlife]]. He ignores Marty's reassurances that his vision was a [[peyote]]-induced hallucination. Billy sets the car on fire, stranding the trio, and calls Charlie, telling him their location. Billy claims he impersonated Myra, causing Hans to leave.

Billy, with Bonny in tow, anxiously waits for Charlie to arrive, intending to have a climactic shootout. Charlie arrives alone, without a weapon apart from a flare gun. An enraged Billy shoots Charlie, feeling cheated out of a shootout. Marty drives away with Charlie, intending to take him to a hospital, while Billy realizes the flare gun's purpose and fires it. Hans finds Charlie's thugs awaiting the flare signal. The large group catches the attention of the police, who draw closer. Hans pretends to draw a weapon, causing Paulo to shoot him in front of the police. Before dying, Hans says "It isn't grey at all".

The thugs head towards the signal, with police in pursuit, and encounter Marty and Charlie, who reveals that he only suffered a flesh wound. With backup, Charlie returns to Billy's location. After a shootout, Charlie and Billy have a stand-off, respectively holding Marty and Bonny hostage. Charlie releases Marty and shoots Billy just as the police arrive. Charlie and Paulo are arrested, but Bonny stays at the dying Billy's side. Marty visits the scene of Hans's death, and finds a tape recorder with suggestions for ''Seven Psychopaths''.

Marty, having adopted Bonny, finishes the screenplay. Some time later, after the ''Seven Psychopaths'' movie is shown in theater, Marty receives a call from Zachariah, who intends to kill him for forgetting to leave a message as promised. On hearing Marty's weary and resigned acceptance, Zachariah realizes that Marty's experiences have left him a changed man, and decides to spare him.

==Production==
The first casting announcements were made on 12 May 2011.&lt;ref name="EmpireOnline"&gt;Williams, Owen (12 May 2011). [http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=30959 "Walken &amp; Rourke Join Seven Psychopaths"]. ''Empire Online''. Retrieved 28 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mickey Rourke]] dropped out of ''[[The Expendables 2]]'' to co-star in the film. He later dropped out of ''Seven Psychopaths'' after having disagreements with McDonagh, calling him a "jerk-off." He was replaced by [[Woody Harrelson]].&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;Schreffler, Laura (11 November 2011).

Colin Farrell gets frisky with a bottle of whisky on the set of his new film"]. ''Daily Mail''. Retrieved 28 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the incident, McDonagh said "I was fine with it. Mickey's a great actor [...] I've known Woody [Harrelson] for years and years, and he was a perfect choice for this too. He's got those great dramatic elements which he's shown in ''[[Rampart (film)|Rampart]]'' recently, and he's always been a fantastic comedian. You need that in this – someone who can be out-and-out funny, but also turn sinister on a dime."&lt;ref name="EntertainmentWeekly"&gt;{{cite web|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|title=Colin Farrell goes barking mad in 'Seven Psychopaths' -- FIRST LOOK PHOTOS|url=http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/02/09/seven-psychopaths-first-look/|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=21 February 2012|date=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
''Seven Psychopaths'' received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 82%, based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Seven Psychopaths'' delivers sly cinematic commentary while serving up a heaping helping of sharp dialogue and gleeful violence."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seven_psychopaths |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=Rotten Tomatoes |publisher= [[Flixster]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film holds a score of 66 out of 100, based on 43 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."&lt;ref name="Metacritic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/seven-psychopaths |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eric Kohn of ''[[IndieWire]]'' gave the film a positive review and a "A-" grade, praising McDonagh's writing, stating that it "hits a unique pitch between dark, bloody satire and interpersonal conflicts that makes his finest work play like a combination of [[Quentin Tarantino]] and [[Aaron Sorkin]]." About the film itself, he wrote: "A less controlled and slapdash character piece than ''In Bruges'', McDonagh's new movie benefits greatly from a plethora of one-liners that toy with crime movie clichés in the unlikely context of writerly obsessions."&lt;ref name="Kihn"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kohn, Eric |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/martin-mcdonaughs-seven-psychopaths-is-a-gloriously-absurd-satire-of-the-writing-process |title=Toronto 2012: Martin McDonagh's 'Seven Psychopaths' Is a Gloriously Absurd Satire of the Writing Process |work=IndieWire.com |publisher=A SnagFilms Co |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'' also gave the film a positive review, writing that "men in movies are often just overgrown boys, and ''Seven Psychopaths'' is out to prove it – in the most twisted, hilarious way possible."&lt;ref name="Puig"&gt;{{cite web |author=Puig, Claudia |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2012/10/10/seven-psychopaths-review/1610879 |title=Deranged comedy 'Seven Psychopaths' has your number |work=USAToday.com |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four. He praised the performances of main cast members and McDonagh's writing, stating that "Walken sometimes leans toward self-parody, but here his performance has a delicate, contained strangeness. All of the actors are good, and Farrell wisely allows the showier performances to circle around him. Like any screenwriter – like [[Quentin Tarantino|Tarantino]], for example, who is possibly McDonagh's inspiration here – he brings these people into being and stands back in amazement." About the film, he added: "This is a delightfully goofy, self-aware movie that knows it is a movie."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ebert|first=Roger |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20121010/REVIEWS/121019997/1023 |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=Chicago Sun-Times |publisher=RogerEbert.com |date=10 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lisa Schwarzbaum]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a "B+" grade, stating: "An energetically demented psycho-killer comedy set in faux-noir L.A., ''Seven Psychopaths'' rollicks along to the unique narrative beat and language stylings of Anglo-Irish writer-director Martin McDonagh (''In Bruges''), channeling Quentin Tarantino."&lt;ref name="Schwarzbaum"&gt;{{cite web |last=Schwarzbaum|first=Lisa |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20620064,00.html |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=EW.com |publisher=Entertainment Weekly Inc |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' praised the performances of the main cast members, he stated: "As creatively bankrupt Marty, Farrell is in subdued mode here, his performance largely defined by the endless expressivity of his eyebrows. He serves as an excellent foil for Rockwell, whose line readings continually dance between knowingness and idiocy, and Walken, who ventures as far into deadpan as you can go while remaining conscious. And Harrelson has fun contrasting his devotion to Bonny with his contempt for humanity." He wrote about the film that "while it's way behind the ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' curve, ''Seven Psychopaths'' can be terrifically entertaining."&lt;ref name="Rooney"&gt;{{cite web |last=Rooney|first=David |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com//review/seven-psychopaths-toronto-review-369669 |title='Seven Psychopaths: Toronto Review |work=The Hollywood Review |date=11 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine Shoard of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the film four stars out of five, indicating a positive review, she wrote: "There are scenes of complete brilliance, Walken is better than he's been in years, cute plot loops and grace notes."&lt;ref name="Shoard"&gt;{{cite web |author=Shoard, Catherine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/07/seven-psychopaths-review |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=Guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |date=7 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave the film three stars out of four, stating: "Blood splatters, heads explode, and McDonagh takes sassy, self-mocking shots at the very notion of being literary in Hollywood. It's crazy-killer fun."&lt;ref name="Travers"&gt;{{cite web |author=Travers, Peter |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/seven-psychopaths-20121011 |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=RollingStone.com |publisher=Wenner Media |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ty Burr]] of ''[[Boston Globe]]'' also gave the film three stars out of four, stating that the film is "absurdly entertaining even after it disappears up its own hindquarters in the last act, and it gives some of our weirder actors ample room to play."&lt;ref name="Burr"&gt;{{cite web |author=Burr, Ty |url=http://www.boston.com/ae/movies/2012/10/11/seven-psychopaths-crazy-good-fun/jn6RF9b5EHI4veztwlBznK/story.html |title='Seven Psychopaths' is crazy, good fun |work=Boston.com |publisher=NY Times Co |date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film three stars out of four, writing that "the result is a clever, violent daydream. But McDonagh's skill behind the camera has grown considerably since ''In Bruges''. And the way he writes, he's able to attract the ideal actors into his garden of psychopathology."&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite web |author=Phillips, Michael |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-1009-seven-psychopaths-20121011,0,6121240.column |title=McDonagh sets violently funny 'Seven Psychopaths' in epic desert|work=Chicago Tribune|date=11 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine gave the film a positive review, stating: "It's at once a gangster movie, a buddy comedy, and a meta-fictional exploration of the limits of both genres - and if that sounds impossible to pull off, well, McDonagh doesn't, quite. But the pure sick brio of ''Seven Psychopaths'' takes it a long way."&lt;ref name="Stevens"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stevens, Dana |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2012/10/seven_psychopaths_reviewed_martin_mcdonagh_s_caper_film_about_dog_nappers.html |title=Pulp Meta-Fiction |work=Slate.com |publisher=The Slate Group, LLC |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]] of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine also gave the film a positive review, writing that "small in stature but consistently entertaining, ''Seven Psychopaths'' is a vacation from consequence for the Tony- and Oscar-winning author, and an unsupervised play date for his cast of screw-loose stars."&lt;ref name="Corliss"&gt;{{cite web |author=Corliss, Richard |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/10/11/seven-psychopaths-smart-violent-crazy-fun|title=Seven Psychopaths: Smart, Violent, Crazy Fun |work=Time.com|publisher=Time Inc|date=11 October 2012|accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ''[[ReelViews]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four, stating: "On balance, one could argue that ''Seven Psychopaths'' warrants a better rating than a mediocre **1/2, but the aftertaste is so bitter that it diminishes the sweetness that started off the meal."&lt;ref name="Berardinelli"&gt;{{cite web |author=Berardinelli, James |url=http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2535 |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=ReelViews.net |date=12 October 2012 |accessdate=15 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peter Debruge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' magazine gave the film a mixed review, stating that "the film's overall tone is so cartoony, it's easy to imagine someone spinning off a macabre animated series of the same name....." and that "compared to McDonagh's best work for stage (''[[The Lieutenant of Inishmore]]'') and screen (''In Bruges''), ''Seven Psychopaths'' feels like either an older script knocking around the bottom of a drawer or a new one hastily tossed off between more ambitious projects."&lt;ref name="Debruge"&gt;{{cite web |author=Debruge, Peter |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117948249 |title=Seven Psychopaths |work=Variety |publisher=Reed Elsevier Properties Inc |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kevin Jagernauth of ''The Playlist'' also gave the film a mixed review, stating that "somewhat spastic and overcooked, ''Seven Psychopaths'' might have a few too many."&lt;ref name="Jagernauth"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jagernauth, Kevin |url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/tiff-review-manic-meta-seven-psychopaths-both-exhausts-delights-20120908 |title=TIFF Review: Manic &amp; Meta 'Seven Psychopaths' Both Exhausts &amp; Delights |work=The Playlist |publisher=IndieWire.com |date=8 September 2012 |accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called '''''Sudovian Book'''''&lt;ref name=title group=nb/&gt; ({{lang-de|Sudauer Büchlein}}, {{lang-lt|Sūduvių knygelė}}) was an anonymous work about the customs, religion, and daily life of the [[Old Prussians]] from [[Sambia]].&lt;ref name=schma/&gt; The manuscript was written in German in the 16th century. The original did not survive and the book is known from later copies, transcriptions and publications. Modern scholars disagree on the origin and value of the book. Despite doubts about its reliability, the book became popular and was frequently quoted in other history books. Much of the [[Prussian mythology]] is reconstructed based on this work or its derivatives.&lt;ref name=schma/&gt;

==Authorship==
According to [[Aleksander Brückner]],&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt; the book originated from letters written around 1545 by Protestant priest Hieronymus Malecki using information from ''Constitutiones Synodales'' published in 1530. The letters were expanded and translated by Malecki's son, who published the Sudovian Book in 1561.&lt;ref name=bojtar/&gt; Therefore, it contained no new or valuable information and could not be considered an independent source of Prussian mythology.&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt;

[[Wilhelm Mannhardt]] believed that Malecki only prepared previously written anonymous manuscript for publication.&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt; According to Mannhardt, the book predated and was used as a source for ''Constitutiones Synodales''. He claimed that the book was written by Lutheran clergy – [[Georg von Polenz]], [[Bishopric of Samland|Bishop of Sambia]], Erhard von Queis, [[Bishopric of Pomesania|Bishop of Pomesania]], and [[Paul Speratus|Paulus Speratus]], preacher of [[Albert, Duke of Prussia]], and later Bishop of Pomesania.&lt;ref name=mle/&gt; During the 1520s they visited different parishes, collected information about pagan beliefs, and memorialized the findings in the ''Sudovian Book'', which was then summarized in the ''Constitutiones Synodales''.&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt;

Lithuanian historian [[Ingė Lukšaitė]] claimed that both the ''Sudovian Book'' and ''Constitutiones Synodales'' were parts of a larger more extensive work.&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt; She noted that these works written in [[Renaissance]] style – the author did not condemn the pagan beliefs and rituals, which was improbable if the works were prepared by Christian clergy seeking to eradicate paganism. Therefore, authors cannot be ascertained.&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt;

==Content==
The book included a list of Prussian gods, sorted in a generally descending order from sky to earth to underworld: Ockopirmus (chief god of sky and stars), Swayxtix (god of light), Auschauts (god of the sick), Autrimpus (god of sea), [[Potrimpus]] (god of running water), Bardoayts (god of boats), Pergrubrius (god of plants), Pilnitis (god of abundance), [[Perkūnas|Parkuns]] (god of thunder and rain), [[Peckols]] (god of hell and darkness), Pockols (flying spirit or devil), Puschkayts (god of earth) and his servants Barstucke (little people) and Markopole.&lt;ref name=schma/&gt;

The book also discussed in detail traditional weddings, funerals, and honoring of the dead.&lt;ref name=mle/&gt; In particular, the book described ritual sacrifice of a goat by a priest (called ''Wourschaity'') in great detail. The work describes customs of [[Sudovians]] living in [[Sambia]]. It is known from [[Peter von Dusburg]] that 1600 and 1500 Sudovians were relocated to Sambia at the end of the 13th century.&lt;ref name=kreg/&gt; Their descendants still lived in the so-called Sudovian Corner and were known as determined believers in their pagan gods. Therefore, [[Norbertas Vėlius]] suggested that the work dealt not with Prussian, but with Sudovian gods and traditions.&lt;ref name=schma/&gt;

==Notes==

&lt;ref name=title&gt;The full title varied greatly between different copies of the manuscript. The title of the printed version is usually given as ''Warhafftige Beschreibung der Sudawen auf Samlandt sambt jhren Bockheyligen vnd Ceremonien'' (''Truthful Description of Goat Sacrifice and Ceremonies by Sudovians from Samland'') . The manual copies were usually titled ''Der Vnglaubigen Sudauen ihrer Bockheiligung mit sambt andern Ceremonien, so sie tzu brauchen gepflegeth'' (''The Goat Sacrifice by the Unbelieving Sudovians Along with Other Ceremonies which They Are in the Habit of Performing'').&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''Tel Aviv Cinematheque''' (also called: '''Doron Cinema center''') is a [[cinematheque]] and movie archive, opened in [[Tel Aviv]] on 12 May 1973.

The Cinematheque, located at [[HaArba'a Street]] 2, has five screening halls . The Cinematheque programming includes Israeli and foreign films  and offers private business screenings to help support the enterprise. Sometimes screenings are held for new Israeli films.

Film festivals  held at the cinematheque include [[TLVFest]], "Doc Aviv" Documentary Film Festival, "Moments of French Cinema", an Australian Film Festival and more. The festivals are supported by groups such as the [[Tel Aviv Museum of Art]].

The cinematheque lobby hosts photo exhibitions by Israeli artists. It also publishes a film journal called "Cinematheque".

The current building was designed by Israeli Architect Salo Hershman, and was opened in 1989.

== Israeli Cinema center ==
In September 2011 the '''Israel Cinema Center''' opened adjacent to the cinematheque. The new wing is three times the size of the original space and contains three new theaters, offices, a library and a restaurant. Like the original building, the new wing was designed by Salo Hershman.

'''''The Sense of Style: The Thinking Person's Guide to Writing in the 21st Century''''' is a 2014 English [[style guide]] written by cognitive scientist, linguist and popular science author [[Steven Pinker]]. Building upon earlier guides, such as Strunk &amp; White's ''[[The Elements of Style]]'' and Fowler's ''[[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]]'', it applies science to the process of writing, and explains its prescriptions by citing studies in related fields – e.g., grammatical phenomena, mental dynamics, and memory load – as well as history and criticism, to "distinguish the rules that enhance clarity, grace, and emotional resonance from those that are based on myths and misunderstandings".

Pinker's prescriptions combine data from ballots given to the Usage Panel of the ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]]'', the usage notes of several dictionaries and style guides, the historical analyses in ''[[Merriam–Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]'', the meta-analysis in Roy Copperud's ''American Usage and Style: The Consensus'', and views from modern linguistics represented in ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'' and the blog [[Language Log]].

==Contents==

===Prologue===
"Style" is the effective use of words to engage the human mind. Style manuals that are innocent of linguistics are crippled in dealing with the aspect of writing that evokes the most emotion: correct and incorrect usage. Orthodox stylebooks are ill-equipped to deal with a fundamental fact about language: it changes over time. Language is not a protocol legislated by an authority but rather a wiki that pools the contributions of millions of writers and speakers.

===Good writing===
''Reverse-engineering good prose as the key to developing a writerly ear'' – The starting point for becoming a good writer is to be a good reader. Good writers are avid readers. They have absorbed a vast inventory of words, idioms, constructions, tropes, and rhetorical tricks, and with them a sensitivity to how they mesh and how they clash. This is the elusive "ear" of a skilled writer – the tacit sense of style which cannot be explicitly taught.

===A window onto the world===
''Classic style as an antidote for academese, bureaucratese, corporatese, legalese, officialese, and other kinds of stuffy prose'' – The key to good style, far more than obeying any list of commandments, is to have a clear conception of the make-believe world in which you're pretending to communicate. A writer of classic prose must simulate two experiences: showing the reader something in the world, and engaging the reader in conversation. Classic style is an ideal. Not all prose should be classic, and not all writers can carry off the pretense. But knowing the hallmarks of classic style will make anyone a better writer, and it is "the strongest cure for the disease that enfeebles academic, bureaucratic, corporate, legal, and official prose".

===The curse of knowledge===
The main cause of incomprehensible prose is the [[curse of knowledge]] – the difficulty of imagining what it is like for someone else not to know something that you know. Be aware of specific pitfalls that it sets in your path, e.g., the use of jargon, abbreviations, and technical vocabulary. Show a draft to some people who are similar to your intended audience, and find out whether they can follow it. Show a draft to yourself, after enough time has passed that the text is no longer familiar. Rework and revise.

===The web, the tree, and the string===
''Understanding syntax can help a writer avoid ungrammatical, convoluted, and misleading prose'' – Learning how to bring the units of language into consciousness can allow writers to reason their way to grammatically consistent sentences, and to diagnose problems. Grammar is a fascinating subject in its own right, when it is properly explained.

===Arcs of coherence===
''How to ensure that readers will grasp the topic, get the point, keep track of the players, and see how one idea follows from another'' – Even if every sentence in a text is crisp, lucid, and well formed, a succession of them can feel choppy, disjointed, unfocused, incoherent. A coherent text is a designed object: an ordered tree of sections within sections, crisscrossed by arcs that track topics, points, actors, and themes, and held together by connectors that tie one proposition to the next. Like other designed objects, it comes about not by accident but by drafting a blueprint, attending to details, and maintaining a sense of harmony and balance.

===Telling right from wrong===
''How to make sense of the rules of correct grammar, word choice, and punctuation'' – The idea that there are exactly two approaches to usage – all the traditional rules must be followed, or else anything goes – is a myth. The first step in mastering usage is to understand why the myth is wrong. There is no such thing as a "language war" between [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptivists]] and [[descriptive linguistics|descriptivists]]. "The alleged controversy is as bogus as other catchy dichotomies such as ''nature versus nurture'' and ''America: Love It or Leave It''." The key is to recognize that the rules of usage are ''tacit conventions''. A convention is an agreement among the members of a community to abide by a single way of doing things. Linguists capture their regularities in "descriptive rules" – that is, rules that describe how people speak and understand. A subset of these conventions is less widespread and natural, but has become accepted by a smaller community of literate speakers for use in public forums such as government, journalism, literature, business, and academia. These conventions are "prescriptive rules" – rules that prescribe how one ought to speak and write in these forums. Unlike the descriptive rules, many of the prescriptive rules have to be stated explicitly, because they are not second nature to most writers: the rules may not apply in the spoken vernacular, or they may be difficult to implement in complicated sentences which tax the writer's memory. This raises the question of how a careful writer can distinguish a legitimate rule of usage from a tall tale. The answer: look it up. Pinker includes a short guide to a hundred of the most commonly raised issues of grammar, word usage, and punctuation. (For Pinker's Top 10 list, see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=10 'grammar rules' it's OK to break (sometimes)|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/15/steven-pinker-10-grammar-rules-break|website=The Guardian|accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

The '''Virtual International Authority File''' ('''VIAF''') is an international [[authority file]]. It is a joint project of several national libraries and operated by the [[OCLC|Online Computer Library Center]] (OCLC).&lt;ref name=LibraryJournal-VIAFtoOCLC&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelley|first1=Michael|last2=Schwartz|first2=Meredith|year=2012|title=VIAF service transitions to OCLC|journal=[[Library Journal]]|volume=137|issue=8|page=16| publisher=[[Media Source Inc.]]}}&amp;nbsp;{{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Discussion about having a common international authority started in the late 1990s. After a series of failed attempts to come up with a unique common authority file, the new idea was to link existing national authorities. This would present all the benefits of a common file without requiring a large investment of time and expense in the process.&lt;ref name=IFLA-VIAF-Origins-2016&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Neill|first1=Edward T.|title=VIAF: Origins|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC4Gt5xXLzo|website=Authority Data on the Web, a Satellite Meeting of the 2016 [[International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions|IFLA]] World Library and Information Congress|publisher=[[OCLC]]|format=Video presentation|date=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was initiated by the US [[Library of Congress]] (LC), the [[German National Library]] (DNB) and the OCLC on August 6, 2003. The [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] (BnF) joined the project on October 5, 2007.

The project transitioned to being a service of the OCLC on April 4, 2012.&lt;ref name=OCLC-VIAF-Service-2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Bob|title=Virtual International Authority File service transitions to OCLC; contributing institutions continue to shape direction through VIAF Council|url=http://www.oclc.org/en/news/releases/2012/201224.html|website=[[OCLC]]|location=Dublin, OH|language=en|format=Press release|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim is to link the national authority files (such as the German [[Name Authority File]]) to a single virtual authority file. In this file, identical records from the different data sets are linked together. A VIAF record receives a standard data number, contains the primary "see" and "see also" records from the original records, and refers to the original authority records. The data are made available online and are available for research and data exchange and sharing. Reciprocal updating uses the [[Open Archives Initiative]] [[Protocol for Metadata Harvesting]] (OAI-PMH) protocol.

The file numbers are also being added to [[Wikipedia]] biographical articles and are incorporated into [[Wikidata]].&lt;ref name=OCLC-VIAFbot-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klein|first1=Max|last2=Renspie|first2=Melissa|title=VIAFbot Edits 250,000 Wikipedia Articles to Reciprocate All Links from VIAF into Wikipedia|url=http://www.oclc.org/research/news/2012/12-07a.html|work=[[OCLC]]|date=7 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Code4Lib-VIAFbot-2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Maximilian|last2=Kyrios|first2=Alex|title=VIAFbot and the Integration of Library Data on Wikipedia|journal=The Code4Lib Journal|date=14 October 2013|issue=22|url=http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8964|issn=1940-5758}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== VIAF clusters ==
VIAF's clustering algorithm is run every month.

The [[Right Reverend|Rt Rev]] ''' William Charles White ''' (22 August 1873 – 24 January 1960), [[Doctor of Divinity|DD]], [[Royal Society of Canada|FRCS]] was an [[Anglican]] [[missionary]] [[bishop]] to [[China]] and later an [[academic]] specializing in Chinese study.&lt;ref&gt;Amongst others he wrote "Tombs of Old Lo-yang", 1934; "Tomb Tile Pictures of Ancient China", 1938; "Chinese Temple Frescoes", 1940; " Bone Culture of Ancient China", 1945; and "Bronze Culture of Ancient China", 1955   &gt; [[British Library]]  website accessed 19:09 [[GMT]] 31 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first bishop of [[Henan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Wickeri|first=Philip L.|title=Anglicanism in China and East Asia, 1819–1912|date=2017-02-02|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199699704.001.0001/acprof-9780199699704-chapter-15|work=The Oxford History of Anglicanism, Volume III|pages=318–337|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199699704.003.0015|isbn=9780199699704|access-date=2018-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his missionary work he was a great collector of Chinese artifacts. A majority of his collection are the foundation for the Chinese collections at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop White, Royal Ontario Museum Re:Collects series [http://www.rom.on.ca/en/romrecollects/stories/keyword/bishop-white]. (retrieved 11-Oct-2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
William C. White was born in [[Devonshire, England]], August 22, 1873. Little is known about his early childhood in England. He was known as Will in his early years,  and was an outgoing child with dark hair and bright blue eyes. In 1880, his father emigrated to [[Canada]] in search of a more stable future for his family. In 1881, Will White, his mother and siblings, sailed to the new world and met their father in [[Norwood, Ontario]]. Will attended the public school and assisted his father in the labors (his father was a mason and contractor by trade). Norwood was a booming town and boasted a number of churches, stores and sports teams.  Norwood would be a place of comparison for White the rest of his life, as he recognized the importance each building and group of people played in his life.

White's boundless energy and an interest in improving the lives of children, moved him to first to [[Kingston, Ontario]] where he began a career with the [[YMCA]] and later to [[Ottawa, Ontario]](around 1892).&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley, Lewis C. (1974). The Bishop of Honan: Mission and Museum in the Life of William C. White. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually rose to the position of administrator at the YMCA which proved an excellent training ground for his future career as a missionary.  At the YMCA he was in charge of planning meetings, conferences and public programing, soliciting funds and meeting with influential people, in an effort to share the mission of the YMCA with the greater community.

In his spare time he was enraptured by the developments in photography. He would spend a number of hours a week taking pictures and developing his own negatives. Unfortunately, his superiors at the YMCA suggested he do something more productive with his time.  He put away his camera (but only temporarily as he would find use for it again in China).  His next interest centered around cycling.  [[Bicycles]] were an easy mode of transportation at the turn of the twentieth century and White was ecstatic to spend hours biking through the countryside around Ottawa visiting families and soliciting donations for the YMCA.  It may have been at one of these outings, or a meeting he hosted at the YMCA, that first piqued his interest in [[missionary]] work.

Initially, White wanted to join fellow missionaries in Africa. But his mother's refusal to support him held off his application until the end of 1893. At which point, the missionary program which White applied to collapsed under financial and political strains.  He was saddened by the loss of opportunity, but continued on with his work in Ottawa. Soon another opportunity arose, this time in China.  He was invited to go to China with the Stewart family, an establish missionary family in Fukien, but he declined as he felt he was not yet ready to leave Canada. This was a small blessing for White, as in 1895 the whole family was massacred in Fukien. It was at this point that White decided he was ready to embark on his missionary work, but felt his high school education inadequate for his career goals. After consulting with family and friends he enrolled in the [[Wycliffe College]] in Toronto.

==Education==
Will White enrolled in Wycliffe College in the spring of 1894, where he studied religion, languages and other academic fields. While at Wycliffe, White attended many lectures and mission programs put on by fellow missionaries around the college campus.  He attended a number of services, in many denominations, so as to broaden his understanding of religion and the Bible. He also participated in local missions in Toronto and would have a "square talk" to anyone who asked. Will White's "square talks" became infamous among people who worked with him during his years at college. He had the ability to turn any conversation towards religion, establish the listener's confidence in him, bread down any resistance and relate intimate religious experiences through a matter of fact tone.  His talks never embarrassed or created resentment among those who listened.&lt;ref&gt;Walmsley, Lewis C. (1974). The Bishop of Honan: Mission and Museum in the Life of William C. White. University of Toronto Press.&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, White inspired his listeners to embark on their own spiritual journey. Although his evangelism seemed to mellow as he aged, he never lost his passion for connecting people to a spiritual path. On May 31, 1896, William C. White was ordained deacon in St. Alban's Cathedral in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Who's Who|"Who was Who" 1897–1990]] London, [[A &amp; C Black]] 1991 {{ISBN|0-7136-3457-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October of the same year he was advised of his appointment to be the next missionary to China through the Missionary Society of Canada.  In January 1897 he was advised to sail to China.

==Missionary to China==
He was a [[Anglican Church of Canada|Canadian Church]] [[Missionary]] in [[Fuhkien|Fukien]] (Fujing) until 1909, however he was sent by the missionary society to survey areas throughout China. In 1909 he was recalled to Toronto and elevated to the rank of Bishop, at which point he returned to his work in China and became the first [[Bishop]] of Henan, a post he held for 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Crockford's Clerical Directory]]1940-41 Oxford, [[OUP]],1941&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in China, White quickly learned local dialects, including Fukien dialect and slowly started to adopt the Chinese way of dress.  Although his stature didn't fool anyone, he felt if he gave an effort to learn the language and dress in familiar garments, those around him would be more open to discussing church matters with him. In 1910 he arrived at his new headquarters in [[Kaifeng]].  His new station came with hefty responsibilities. Aware of his new station in the church, White pushed other people hard, as he had once been as a new missionary. During his tenure in Honan, White was responsible for the building of eleven churches, each with an ordained Chinese pastor. Although his primary focus was the building of the Anglican missions, he also made significant contributions to health programs, welfare and educational programs in local villages throughout Honan.&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Lovat.(1986) ''The Museum Makers: The Story of the Royal Ontario Museum''. Toronto. The Bryant Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting with the Chinese Revolution in 1911, the world around Honan started to change, although Bishop White seemed oblivious to it, he was probably aware of changing political scenes in the east, and west.  After World War I, Bishop White felt he was nearing the end of his work. Although he had been collecting pieces of interest throughout his time in China, he turned his attention to collecting starting in the 1920s. By 1934, the church (including Bishop White) were being driven out of China by civil war and the Whites decided to return to Toronto.

==The Royal Ontario Museum==
During White's time in China he learned a great deal of about Chinese art, religion, industry and traditional life. In 1924, while on leave in Toronto, White had a meeting with [[Charles Trick Currelly|Charles T. Currelly]], a charismatic archaeologist who had been charged with establishing a museum for the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref&gt;Dickson, Lovat. (1986). ''The Museum Makers: The Story of the Royal Ontario Museum''. Toronto. The Bryant Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This chance meeting and budding friendship lead to a decade long partnership in the pursuit of museum specimens.

Today a number of the items in the Asian Galleries and collections at the ROM reflect Bishop White's commitment to preserving specimens that were reflective of his time in China.  Artifacts range from pottery to art work and textiles.  As well as parts of structures that were sent to Currelly for reconstruction in the museum.

==Marriage and Family==
In October 1897, Annie Ray, a fellow student and missionary with the Missionary Society of Canada, joined White in China.  Prior to White's departure from Canada, they had hoped to be married, but forces kept them apart for most of 1897.  They were married in Shanghai shortly after Annie arrived in China. The Whites were then sent to survey the province of Honan, one of the last provinces opened to the western world. The Whites had three children, Stewart, Gordon, and Mary.  After the death of Annie, White's social and professional life became chaotic. By 1935 he had reestablished a connection with another missionary, Daisy Masters, and they were married in Quebec City later that year. Upon his return to Toronto, the Whites hoped to establish a home of refuge from the busy schedules of both Will and Daisy. They purchased a small cottage in [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]] where they would take weekend and summer rest-bits from the city.

==Post Mission Work==
Upon his permanent return to Toronto in 1935 until his retirement 1948, White was [[Professor]] of [[China|Chinese]] [[Academia|Studies]] at the [[University of Toronto]]. He died on 24 January 1960.

'''Wordia''' is an online [[visual dictionary]] which has the published aim of 'redefining the dictionary'. It asks members of the public and celebrity 'orators' to upload videos explaining what words mean to them. The videos are then published on the site alongside the traditional textual definition sourced from the Collins English Dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordia.com/who_are_we |title=Who Are We |accessdate=2008-10-02 |publisher=Wordia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920220157/http://wordia.com/who_are_we |archivedate=September 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was founded in 2008 by TV producer Ed Baker, backed by the online entrepreneur [[Michael Birch (businessman)|Michael Birch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/09/18/birch-backs-wordia-a-video-dictionary-oh-yes/ | title=Birch backs Wordia – a video dictionary? Oh yes.
