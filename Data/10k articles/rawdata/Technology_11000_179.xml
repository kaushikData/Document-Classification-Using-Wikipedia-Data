Its product range consists of low-power desktop and server computers. Its products are used in the developing world and as [[original design manufacturer|original base designs]] for externally branded products.&lt;ref name="about_us"/&gt; Its computers have been purchased by [[Unicef]], [[Tesco]], [[Schlumberger]], [[Pret a Manger]], [[Virgin Media]], and the [[National Health Service]].&lt;ref name="about_us"/&gt; All computers come with the option to ship a version of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] or [[Linux Mint]], alongside the mainstream choice of [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name="aleutia_products"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleutia.com/products|title=Products|publisher=Aleutia|accessdate=13 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707105757/http://www.aleutia.com/products|archive-date=7 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Aleutia was founded in [[London]] by Michael Rosenberg in October 2006,&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aleutia.com/overview |title=Overview |publisher=Aleutia |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227030144/http://aleutia.com/overview |archivedate=27 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; motivated by the unreliability, inefficiency, and expense of the [[Hewlett-Packard]] PCs in the [[internet cafe]] he had set up in [[Takoradi]], [[Ghana]] in the summer of 2006.&lt;ref name="about_us_20100726"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleutia.com/about-us |title=About Us |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726144208/http://www.aleutia.com/about-us |archivedate=26 July 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="about_us_20130420"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleutia.com/about-us |title=About Us |accessdate=2013-11-12 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420052058/http://www.aleutia.com/about-us |archivedate=20 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first product was the E1, which was introduced for public sale in October 2007, was a fanless, low-power computer targeting the need for energy efficient computers in Africa.&lt;ref name="ZDNet E1 review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/reviews/desktop-pcs/2008/02/21/aleutia-e1-39327049/ |title=Aleutia E1 |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |accessdate=19 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223210513/http://www.zdnet.co.uk/reviews/desktop-pcs/2008/02/21/aleutia-e1-39327049/ |archivedate=23 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the company's employees as shown on the website are now either retired or working elsewhere. The company stopped responding to telephone calls and emails in early 2018 and has effectively ceased trading.

'''Ammonium nitrate''' is a [[chemical compound]], the [[nitrate]] salt of the [[ammonium]] [[cation]]. It has the chemical formula [[Nitrogen|N]][[Hydrogen|H]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;[[Nitrogen|N]][[Oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, simplified to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a white crystal solid and is highly soluble in water. It is predominantly used in [[agriculture]] as a high-nitrogen [[fertilizer]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Karl-Heinz Zapp "Ammonium Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2012, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a02_243}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its other major use is as a component of [[explosive]] mixtures used in mining, quarrying, and civil construction. It is the major constituent of [[ANFO]], a popular industrial explosive which accounts for 80% of explosives used in North America; similar formulations have been used in [[improvised explosive device]]s. Many countries are phasing out its use in consumer applications due to concerns over its potential for misuse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dallasnews.com/news/news/2013/10/05/ammonium-nitrate-sold-by-ton-as-u.s.-regulation-is-stymied Ammonium nitrate sold by ton as U.S. regulation is stymied.] - [[The Dallas Morning News]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Ammonium nitrate is found as a natural mineral ([[gwihabaite]] — the ammonium analogue of [[saltpetre]], which is correctly called niter, and other nitre minerals such as [[sodium nitrate]] known as nitratine) in the driest regions of the [[Atacama Desert]] in Chile, often as a crust on the ground and/or in conjunction with other nitrate, [[iodate]], and [[halide minerals]]. Ammonium nitrate was mined there in the past, but virtually 100% of the chemical now used is synthetic.

==Production==
The industrial production of ammonium nitrate entails the [[acid-base reaction theories|acid-base reaction]] of [[ammonia]] with [[nitric acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/patents/pdf/Process_of_producing_concentrated_soluti.pdf?id=XronAAAAEBAJ&amp;output=pdf&amp;sig=ACfU3U0iYFRDUxltKLaVind-3wwP_JYPxg&lt;/ref&gt;
:HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
Ammonia is used in its [[anhydrous]] form (i.e., gas form) and the nitric acid is concentrated. This reaction is violent owing to its highly exothermic nature. After the solution is formed, typically at about 83% concentration, the excess water is evaporated to an ammonium nitrate (AN) content of 95% to 99.9% concentration (AN melt), depending on grade. The AN melt is then made into "prills" or small beads in a [[spray tower]], or into granules by spraying and tumbling in a rotating drum. The prills or granules may be further dried, cooled, and then coated to prevent caking. These prills or granules are the typical AN products in commerce.

The ammonia required for this process is obtained by the [[Haber process]] from nitrogen and hydrogen. Ammonia produced by the Haber process is oxidized to nitric acid by the [[Ostwald process]]. Another production method is a variant of the [[Nitrophosphate process|Odda process]]:

:[[calcium nitrate|Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] +  [[ammonia|2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

The products, [[calcium carbonate]] and ammonium nitrate, may be separately purified or sold combined as [[calcium ammonium nitrate]].

Ammonium nitrate can also be made via [[metathesis reaction]]s:
:[[ammonium sulfate|(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[barium nitrate|Ba(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + [[barium sulfate|BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]
:[[ammonium chloride|NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl]] + [[silver nitrate|AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + [[silver chloride|AgCl]]

===Reactions===
Ammonium nitrate reacts with metal hydroxides, releasing ammonia and forming alkali metal nitrate:

: NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + MOH → NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + MNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (M = Na, K)

Ammonium nitrate leaves no residue when heated:

: NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

When rapidly heated or exploded the predominant reaction is:

: 2NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Ammonium nitrate is also formed in the atmosphere from emissions of NO, SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a secondary component of some [[PM10|PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] particulates.&lt;ref name="Int Panis"&gt;{{cite journal

===Crystalline phases===
Transformations of the crystal states due to changing conditions (temperature, pressure) affect the physical properties of ammonium nitrate. These crystalline states have been identified:

The type V crystal is a quasi[[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] form related to [[caesium chloride]], the nitrogen atoms of the nitrate anions and the ammonium cations are at the sites in a cubic array where Cs and Cl would be in the CsCl lattice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=C.

J. |last2=Prask |title=The structure of ND&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase V by neutron powder diffraction |journal=Acta Crystallographica B |year=1983 |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=414–420 |doi=10.1107/S0108768183002669 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
===Fertilizer===
Ammonium nitrate is an important fertilizer with the [[NPK rating]] 34-0-0 (34% nitrogen).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fieldcrops/forages/events/SHC12/03%20Fertilization%20Outlook%20for%20Hay%20Producers/Nutrient%20Content%20of%20Fertilizer%20Materials.pdf |title=Nutrient Content of Fertilizer Materials |access-date=2012-06-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224131002/http://www.caes.uga.edu/commodities/fieldcrops/forages/events/SHC12/03%20Fertilization%20Outlook%20for%20Hay%20Producers/Nutrient%20Content%20of%20Fertilizer%20Materials.pdf |archive-date=2012-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is less concentrated than [[urea]] (46-0-0), giving ammonium nitrate a slight transportation disadvantage. Ammonium nitrate's advantage over urea is that it is more stable and does not rapidly lose nitrogen to the atmosphere.

===Explosives===
Ammonium nitrate is not, on its own, an explosive,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/19/nyregion/new-york-explosion-chelsea.html Manhattan Bombs Provide Trove of Clues] - [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; but it readily forms explosive mixtures with varying properties when combined with primary explosives such as [[Azide#Applications|azides]] or with fuels such as [[tannerite|aluminum powder]] or [[ANFO|fuel oil]].

====Mixture with fuel oil====
{{main|ANFO}}
ANFO is a mixture of 94% ammonium nitrate ("AN") and 6% [[fuel oil]] ("FO") widely used as a bulk industrial [[explosive]].&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Melvin A. |title=The Science of Industrial Explosives |publisher=IRECO Chemicals |year=1974 |page=1 |asin=B0000EGDJT}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} It is used in [[coal mining]], [[quarrying]], metal [[mining]], and civil construction in undemanding applications where the advantages of ANFO's low cost and ease of use matter more than the benefits offered by conventional industrial explosives, such as water resistance, oxygen balance, high detonation velocity, and performance in small diameters.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;{{rp|2}}

====Terrorism====
Ammonium nitrate-based explosives were used in the [[Sterling Hall bombing]] in Madison, Wisconsin, 1970, the [[Oklahoma City bombing]] in 1995, the [[2011 Delhi bombing]]s, the [[2013 Hyderabad blasts]], and the [[2011 Norway attacks|2011 bombing in Oslo]].

In November 2009, a ban on [[ammonium sulfate]], ammonium nitrate, and [[calcium ammonium nitrate]] fertilizers was imposed in the former [[Malakand Division]]—comprising the [[Upper Dir]], [[Lower Dir]], [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]], [[Chitral]], and [[Malakand District|Malakand]] districts of the [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) of [[Pakistan]]—by the NWFP government, following reports that those chemicals were used by militants to make explosives. Due to these bans, "[[Potassium chlorate]] — the stuff that makes matches catch fire — has surpassed fertilizer as the explosive of choice for insurgents."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/06/25/ammonium-nitrate-potassium-chlorate-ieds-afghanistan/2442191/ Potassium chlorate — the stuff that makes matches catch fire — has surpassed fertilizer as the explosive of choice for insurgents.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===
Ammonium nitrate is used in some [[instant cold pack]]s, as its dissolution in water is highly [[endothermic]]. It also was used, in combination with independently explosive "fuels" such as [[guanidine nitrate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=US|number=5531941}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/business/compound-in-takata-airbags-is-inquirys-focus.html Airbag Compound Has Vexed Takata for Years] - [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; as a cheaper (but less stable) alternative to [[5-aminotetrazole]] in the inflators of [[airbag]]s manufactured by [[Takata Corporation]], which were recalled as unsafe after killing 14 people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/business/takata-airbag-recall-crisis.html?hpw&amp;rref=automobiles&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well A Cheaper Airbag, and Takata’s Road to a Deadly Crisis.] - [[The New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety, handling, and storage==
Health and safety data are shown on the [[safety data sheet]]s available from suppliers and found on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927336 Ammonium nitrate MSDS]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to several explosions resulting in the deaths of numerous people, U.S. agencies of Environmental Protection (EPA), Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms jointly issued safety guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo45474 Chemical Advisory: Safe Storage, Handling, and Management of Ammonium Nitrate] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heating or any ignition source may cause violent [[combustion]] or explosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author= Pradyot Patnaik| title= Handbook of Inorganic Chemicals| publisher= McGraw-Hill| year= 2002| ISBN= 0-07-049439-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium nitrate reacts with combustible and reducing materials as it is a strong [[oxidant]]. Although it is mainly used for fertilizer, it can be used for explosives. It was sometimes used to blast away earth to make farm ponds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.library.wisc.edu/EcoNatRes/EFacs/DNRResearch/DNRRep045/reference/econatres.dnrrep045.i0012.pdf Pothole pond]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Progressive Farmer Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium nitrate is also used to modify the detonation rate of other explosives, such as [[trinitrotoluene]] in the form of [[amatol]].

Numerous safety guidelines are available for storing and handling ammonium nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg230.pdf Storing and handling ammonium nitrate]&lt;/ref&gt; It should not be stored near combustible substances.  Ammonium nitrate is incompatible with certain substances such as [[chlorate]]s, [[mineral acid]]s and [[metal sulfide]]s, contact with which can lead to vigorous or even violent decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidic.it/lp2013/webpapers/141cagnina.pdf Chemical Engineering Transactions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414164158/http://www.aidic.it/lp2013/webpapers/141cagnina.pdf |date=2016-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium nitrate has a [[critical relative humidity]] of 59.4%, above which it will absorb moisture from the atmosphere. Therefore, it is important to store ammonium nitrate in a tightly sealed container. Otherwise, it can coalesce into a large, solid mass. Ammonium nitrate can absorb enough moisture to liquefy. Blending ammonium nitrate with certain other fertilizers can lower the critical relative humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The potential for use of the material as an explosive has prompted regulatory measures. For example, in Australia, the Dangerous Goods Regulations came into effect in August 2005 to enforce licensing in dealing with such substances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.nsw.gov.au/sessionalview/sessional/subordleg/2005-531.pdf Dangerous Goods (HCDG) Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt; Licenses are granted only to applicants (industry) with appropriate security measures in place to prevent any misuse.&lt;ref&gt;Ammonium Nitrate-Regulating its use, Balancing Access &amp; Protection from {{cite web| url= http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/wsinternet/worksafe/home/forms+and+publications/publications/import_ammonium+nitrate+-+regulating+its+use%2C+balancing+access+_+protection| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110311054639/http://www.worksafe.vic.gov.au/wps/wcm/connect/wsinternet/worksafe/home/forms+and+publications/publications/import_ammonium+nitrate+-+regulating+its+use%2C+balancing+access+_+protection| dead-url= yes| archive-date= 2011-03-11| title= Worksafe Victoria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional uses such as education and research purposes may also be considered, but individual use will not. Employees of those with licenses to deal with the substance are still required to be supervised by authorized personnel and are required to pass a security and national police check before a license may be granted.

==Health hazards==
Health and safety data are shown on the [[material safety data sheet]]s, which are available from suppliers and can be found on the internet.&lt;ref name ="MSDS"/&gt;

Ammonium nitrate is not hazardous to health and is usually used in fertilizer products.&lt;ref name="MSDS"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.cfindustries.com/pdf/Ammonium-Nitrate-Amtrate-MSDS.pdf| title =Ammonium nitrate MSDS| author =CF Industries| date =| work =| publisher =| accessdate =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140327104129/http://www.cfindustries.com/pdf/Ammonium-Nitrate-Amtrate-MSDS.pdf| archivedate =2014-03-27| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/ammonium%20nitrate.htm|title=Chemicalland21 – Ammonium Nitrate|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110035253/http://chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/inorganic/ammonium%20nitrate.htm|archivedate=2012-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title= Ammonium Nitrate| publisher= Paton Fertilizers Pty Ltd | year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonium nitrate has an [[median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] of 2217&amp;nbsp;mg/kg,&lt;ref name=MSDS1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927336|title=Material Safety Data Sheet, Ammonium nitrate MSDS}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for comparison is about two-thirds that of [[sodium chloride|table salt]].

==Disasters==
{{main|Ammonium nitrate disasters}}
Ammonium nitrate decomposes into the [[gas]]es [[nitrous oxide]] and [[water vapor]] when heated (not an explosive reaction); however, it can be induced to decompose explosively by [[detonation]]. Large stockpiles of the material can be a major fire risk due to their supporting [[oxidation]], and may also detonate, as happened in the [[Texas City disaster]] of 1947, which led to major changes in the regulations for storage and handling.

Two major classes of incidents resulting in explosions are:
* The explosion happens by the mechanism of shock-to-detonation transition. The initiation happens by an explosive charge going off in the mass, by the detonation of a shell thrown into the mass, or by detonation of an explosive mixture in contact with the mass. The examples are [[Ammonium nitrate disasters#Kriewald.2C Germany.2C 1921|Kriewald]], [[Ammonium nitrate disasters#Morgan.2C New Jersey.2C 1918 .28Now Sayreville.29|Morgan]] (present-day [[Sayreville, New Jersey]]), [[Oppau explosion|Oppau]], and [[Tessenderlo]].
* The explosion results from a fire that spreads into the ammonium nitrate itself ([[Texas City Disaster|Texas City]], [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Oakdale, Pennsylvania|Oakdale PA]]), or from a mixture of ammonium nitrate with a combustible material during the fire ([[Repauno]], Cherokee, [[Nadadores]]). The fire must be confined at least to a degree for successful transition from a fire to an explosion (a phenomenon known as "[[deflagration-to-detonation transition]]"). Pure, compact AN is stable and very difficult to ignite, and numerous cases exist when even impure AN did not explode in a fire.

'''Ammunition''' (informally '''ammo''') is the material fired, scattered, dropped or detonated from any [[weapon]]. Ammunition is both expendable weapons (e.g., [[bomb]]s, [[missile]]s, [[Grenade|grenades,]] [[land mine]]s) and the component parts of other weapons that create the effect on a target (e.g., [[bullet]]s and [[Warhead|warheads)]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ammunition|title=the definition of ammunition|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all mechanical weapons require some form of ammunition to operate.

The term ammunition can be traced back to the mid-17th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The word comes from the French ''la munition,'' for the material used for war. Ammunition and munitions are often used interchangeably, although munition now usually refers to the actual weapons system with the ammunition required to operate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/munitions|title=the definition of munitions|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages other than English ammunition is still referred to as munition, such as  French (''"munitions"''), German (''"Munition"'') or Italian (''"munizione"'').

The purpose of ammunition is to project a force against a selected [[Targeting (warfare)|target]] to have an effect (usually, but not always, lethal). The most iconic example of ammunition is the firearm [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]], which includes all components required to deliver the weapon effect in a single package.

Ammunition comes in a great range of sizes and types and is often designed to work only in specific weapons systems. However, there are internationally recognized standards for certain ammunition types (e.g., [[5.56×45mm NATO]]) that enable their use across different weapons and by different users. There are also specific types of ammunition that are designed to have a specialized effect on a target, such as [[armor-piercing shell]]s and [[tracer ammunition]], used only in certain circumstances. Ammunition is commonly colored in a specific manner to assist in the identification and to prevent the wrong ammunition types from being used accidentally.

== Glossary ==
{{main|Glossary of firearms terms}}
* A '''round''' is a single [[Cartridge (firearms)|cartridge]] containing a [[projectile]], [[propellant]], [[Blasting cap|primer]] and [[cartridge (firearms)|casing]].
*A '''shell''' is a form of ammunition that is fired by a large [[caliber]] [[cannon]] or artillery piece. Before the mid-19th century, these shells were usually made of solid materials and relied on kinetic energy to have an effect. However, since that time, they are more often filled with high-explosives (see [[artillery]]).
* A '''shot''' refers to a single release of a weapons system. This may involve firing just one round or piece of ammunition (e.g., from a [[semi-automatic firearm]]), but can also refer to ammunition types that release a large number of projectiles at the same time (e.g., [[cluster munition]]s or [[Shotgun|shotgun shells).]] 
* A '''[[dud]]''' refers to loaded ammunition that fails to function as intended, typically failing to detonate on landing. However, it can also refer to ammunition that fails to fire inside the weapon, known as a misfire, or when the ammunition only partially functions, known as a '''[[hang fire]]'''. Dud ammunition, which is classified as an [[unexploded ordnance]] (UXO), is regarded as highly dangerous. In former conflict zones, it is not uncommon for dud ammunition to remain buried in the ground for many years. Large quantities of ammunition from [[World War I]] continue to be regularly found in fields throughout France and Belgium and occasionally still claim lives. Although classified as an [[unexploded ordnance]], landmines that have been left behind after conflict are not considered duds as they have not failed to work and may still be fully functioning and simply forgotten.
* A '''bomb,''' or more specifically a '''[[guided bomb|guided]]''' or '''[[unguided bomb]]''' (also called an '''aircraft bomb''' or '''[[aerial bomb]]'''), is typically an airdropped, unpowered explosive weapon. Mines and the warheads used in guided missiles and rockets are also referred to as bomb-type ammunition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aircraft ordnance|url=http://www.usna.edu/Training/_files/documents/References/2C%20MQS%20References/NAVEDTRA%2014014A%20Ch.%209%20Aircraft%20Ordnance.pdf|publisher=United States Naval Academy|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
[[Image:Battery Rodgers magazine.jpg|thumb|right|[[Projectile|Cannonballs]] from the [[American Civil War]]]]

Ammunition design has evolved throughout history as different weapons have been developed and different effects required. Historically, ammunition was of relatively simple design and build (e.g., sling-shot, stones hurled by catapults), but as weapon designs developed (e.g., [[rifling]]) and became more refined, the requirement for more specialized ammunition increased. Modern ammunition can vary significantly in quality but is usually manufactured to very high standards.

For example, ammunition for hunting can be designed to [[Expanding bullet|expand]] inside the target, maximizing the damage inflicted by a single round. Anti-personnel shells are designed to fragment into many pieces and can affect a large area. Armor-piercing rounds are specially hardened to penetrate armor, while smoke ammunition covers an area with a fog that screens people from view. More generic ammunition (e.g., [[5.56×45mm NATO]]) can often be altered slightly to give it a more specific effect (e.g., tracer, incendiary), whilst larger explosive rounds can be altered by using different fuzes.

== Components==
[[File:US Army 53437 091014-A-8267F-221.jpg|thumb|Preparing 105mm M119 howitzer ammunition: powder propellant, cartridge, and shell with fuze.]]
The components of ammunition intended for rifles and munitions may be divided into these categories:
* [[Fuze|Fuze or primer]]
* [[explosive material]]s and [[gunpowder|propellants]]
* [[projectile]]s of all kinds
* [[cartridge (firearms)|cartridge casing]]

=== Fuzes ===
{{Main|Fuze}}
The term "fuze" refers to the [[detonator]] of an explosive round or shell. The spelling is different in British English and American English (fuse/fuze respectively) and they are unrelated from a [[fuse (electrical)]]. A [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] was earlier used to ignite the propellant (e.g., such as on a firework) until the advent of more reliable systems such as the [[Primer (firearm)|primer]] or igniter that is used in most modern ammunitions.

The fuze of a weapon can be used to alter how the ammunition works. For example, a common artillery shell fuze can be set to 'point detonation' (detonation when it hits the target), delay (detonate after it has hit and penetrated the target), time-delay (explode a specified time after firing or impact) and proximity (explode above or next to a target without hitting it, such as for airburst effects or anti-aircraft shells). These allow a single ammunition type to be altered to suit the situation it is required for. There are many designs of a fuze, ranging from simple mechanical to complex radar and barometric systems.

Fuzes are usually armed by the acceleration force of firing the projectile, and usually arm several meters after clearing the bore of the weapon. This helps to ensure the ammunition is safer to handle when loading into the weapon and reduces the chance of the detonator firing before the ammunition has cleared the weapon.

=== Propellant or explosive ===
{{Main|gunpowder|propellant}}The propellant is the component of ammunition that is activated inside the weapon and provides the kinetic energy required to move the projectile from the weapon to the target. Before the use of gunpowder, this energy would have been produced mechanically by the weapons system (e.g., a catapult or crossbow); in modern times, it is usually a form of chemical energy that rapidly burns to create kinetic force, and an appropriate amount of chemical propellant is packaged with each round of ammunition. In recent years, compressed gas, magnetic energy and electrical energy have been used as propellants.

Until the 20th-century, [[gunpowder]] was the most common propellant in ammunition. However, it has since been replaced by a wide range of fast-burning compounds that are more reliable and efficient.

The propellant charge is distinct from the projectile charge which is activated by the fuze, which causes the ammunition effect (e.g., the exploding of an artillery round).

=== Cartridge case or container ===
{{Main|cartridge (firearm)}}
[[Image:Inspecting Cases.jpg|thumb|Female ordnance workers inspecting cartridge cases in [[Los Angeles]], 1943]]

The cartridge is the container that holds the projectile and propellant. Not all ammunition types have a cartridge case. In its place, a wide range of materials can be used to contain the explosives and parts. With some large weapons, the ammunition components are stored separately until loaded into the weapon system for firing. With small arms, [[caseless ammunition]] can reduce the weight and cost of ammunition, and simplify the firing process for increased firing rate, but the maturing technology has functionality issues.

=== Projectile ===
The projectile is the part of the ammunition that leaves the weapon and has the effect on the target. This effect is usually either kinetic (e.g., as with a standard bullet) or through the delivery of explosives.

== Storage ==
See [[ammunition dump]] and [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]] for a discussion of modern ammunition storage facilities.

==Common types==
[[Image:Rifle cartridge comparison.jpg|thumb|right|Various [[Cartridge (firearms)|rifle cartridges]] compared to the height of a US$1 bill.]]

=== Small arms ===
{{see also|bullet}}
The standard weapon of a modern soldier is an [[assault rifle]], which, like other small arms, uses cartridge ammunition in a size specific to the weapon. Ammunition is carried on the person in box magazines specific to the weapon, ammo boxes, pouches or bandoliers. The amount of ammo carried is dependent on the strength of the soldier, the expected action required, and the ability of ammunition to move forward through the logistical chain to replenish the supply. A soldier may also carry a smaller amount of specialized ammunition for heavier weapons such as machine guns and mortars, spreading the burden for squad weapons over many people. Too little ammunition poses a threat to the mission, while too much limits the soldier's mobility.

=== Shells ===
{{main|Shell (projectile)}}

A shell is a payload-carrying [[projectile]] which, as opposed to a [[Round shot|shot]], contains explosives or other fillings, in use since the 19th century.

==== Artillery ====
{{main|artillery|cannon}}
[[Image:M107 Shells.JPEG|thumb|left|[[M107 projectile|M107]] Shells]]
Artillery shells are ammunition that is designed to be fired from [[artillery]] which has an effect over long distances, usually indirectly (i.e., out of sight of the target). There are many different types of artillery ammunition, but they are usually high-explosive and designed to shatter into pieces of [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] on impact to maximize damage. The fuze used on an artillery shell can alter how it explodes or behaves so it has a more specialized effect. Common types of artillery ammunition include high explosive, smoke, illumination, and practice rounds. Some artillery rounds are designed as [[cluster munition]]s. Artillery ammunition will almost always include a projectile (the only exception being demonstration/blank rounds), fuze and propellant of some form. When a cartridge case is not used, there will be some other method of containing the propellant explosion, usually a [[breech-loading weapon]].
{{-}}

==== Tank ====
{{main|Tank|Shaped charge}}
[[File:IMI120shells.jpg|thumb|upright|Modern 120 mm tank gun cartridges with different projectiles]]
Tank ammunition was developed in WWI as tanks first appeared on the battlefield. However, as tank-on-tank warfare developed (including the development of anti-tank artillery), more specialized forms of ammunition were developed such as [[high-explosive anti-tank warhead]]s and [[armour-piercing discarding sabot|armor-piercing discarding sabot]] rounds. The development of [[shaped charge]]s has had a significant impact on anti-tank ammunition design, now common on both tank-fire ammunition and in anti-tank missiles.

==== Naval ====
[[File:Unexploded shell in the cathedral in Genoa (Italy).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Armor-piercing naval shell – with [[APCBC|cap]] (left) fired on 9 February 1941 in the [[nave]] of Genoa cathedral]] 
Naval weapons were originally the same as many land-based weapons, but the ammunition was designed for specific use, such as a solid shot designed to hole the enemy ship and [[chain-shot]] to cut the rigging and sails. Modern naval engagements have taken place over much larger distances than historic battles, so as ship armor has increased in strength and thickness, the ammunition to defeat it has also changed. Naval ammunition is now designed to reach very high velocities (to improve its armor-piercing capabilities) and may have specialized fuzes for defeating specific types of vessels. However, due to the extended ranges at which modern naval combat may take place, guided missiles have largely supplanted guns and shells.

=== Aircraft and anti-aircraft ===
{{main|Bomb|Anti-aircraft warfare}}

== Logistics ==
With every successive improvement in military arms, there has been a corresponding modification in the method of supplying ammunition in the quantity required. As soon as projectiles were required (such as javelins and arrows), there needed to be a method of replenishment. When non-specialized, interchangeable or recoverable ammunition was used (e.g., arrows), it was possible to pick up spent arrows (both friendly and enemy) and reuse them. However, with the advent of explosive or non-recoverable ammunition, this was no longer possible and new supplies of ammunition would be needed.

The weight of ammunition required, particularly for artillery shells, can be considerable, causing a need for extra time to replenish supplies. In modern times, there has been an increase in the standardization of many ammunition types between allies (e.g., the NATO [[Standardization Agreement]]) that has allowed for shared ammunition types (e.g., [[5.56×45mm NATO]]).

==Environmental problems==
{{As of|2013|post=,}} lead-based ammunition production is the second-largest annual use of lead in the US, accounting for over 60,000 metric tons consumed in 2012.&lt;ref name=usgs113&gt;{{cite web|author1=USGS |title=Mineral Industry Surveys, Lead |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/mineral |publisher=United States Geological Survey |accessdate=30 December 2014 |date=January 2013 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead bullets that miss their target or remain in a carcass or body that was never retrieved can enter environmental systems and become toxic to wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dr. Göttlein Axel|title=Eco-toxicological assessment of hunting  rifle ammunition|url=http://www.leadinammunition.com/independent-studies-002/|publisher=Bavarian Ministry of Nutrition, Agriculture and Forestry upon an initiative of the Bavarian Hunting Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US military has experimented with replacing lead with copper as a slug in their [[green bullet]]s which reduces the dangers posed by lead in the environment as a result of artillery. Since 2010, this has eliminated over 2000 tons of lead in waste streams.&lt;ref name="army713"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Audra Calloway|title=Picatinny ammo goes from regular to unleaded|url=http://www.army.mil/article/106710/Picatinny_ammo_goes_from_regular_to_unleaded/|publisher=Army.mil|accessdate=30 December 2014|date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Arctic Sun Temperature Management System''' is a non-invasive [[targeted temperature management]] system, a [[medical device]] used to modulate patient temperature with precision by circulating chilled water in pads directly adhered to the patient's skin. Using varying water temperatures and a sophisticated computer algorithm, a patient's body temperature can be controlled to the nearest 0.2&amp;nbsp;°C. It is produced by Medivance, Inc. of [[Louisville, Colorado]].

==Background==
Body temperature, which is systematically measured and reported as a vital sign, contributes to maintenance of normal physiology and affects the processes that lead to recovery after illness. Complete and proper functioning of the body is dependent on maintaining a core temperature between {{convert|36.5|-|38.5|C|F}}. A core temperature above 41.5&amp;nbsp;°C or below 33.5&amp;nbsp;°C causes a fast decline in proper functioning of the body and may result in injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moran|first=Daniel S.|author2=Mendal, Liran|title=Core Temperature Measurement: Methods and Current Insights|journal=Sports Medicine|date=2002|volume=32|issue=14|pages=879–885|doi=10.2165/00007256-200232140-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional manipulation of body temperature has been studied as a treatment strategy for head injuries since the 1900s. In the 1980s, the use of hypothermia on dogs after cardiac arrest demonstrated positive outcomes including neurological status and survival. In 2005, the American Heart Association implemented recommendations and guidelines for mild hypothermia in post-resuscitation support after cardiac arrest with return of spontaneous circulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKean|first=Staci|title=Induced Moderate Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest|journal=AACN Advanced Critical Care|date=2009|doi=10.1097/NCI.0b013e3181bcea4e|pmid=19893373|volume=20|issue=4|pages=342–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common practices of targeted temperature management is to reduce body temperature to a “mild hypothermic state” (per the AHA guidelines is 33&amp;nbsp;°C (91.4&amp;nbsp;°F) for 12–24 hours and then slowly re-warm the body back to normal 37&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F). The purpose of this is to slow the metabolic processes and the chemical cascade that occurs when the brain goes without oxygen for a period of time. A study conducted in 2002-2004 showed that treatment with therapeutic hypothermia for patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation led to a positive outcome (Glasgow-Pittsburgh Cerebral Performance category 1 or 2) in 24 of 43 patients compared to only 11 of 43 patients in the standard resuscitation group where no hypothermia was used in treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oddo|first=Mauro |author2=Schaller, MD. |author3=Feihl, F. |author4=Ribordy, V. |author5=Liaudet, L.|title=From evidence to clinical practice: Effective implementation of therapeutic hypothermia to improve patient outcome after cardiac arrest|journal=Critical Care Medicine|date=2006|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1865–1873|pmid=16715035|doi=10.1097/01.CCM.0000221922.08878.49|pmc=2764536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Therapeutic hypothermia]], which lowers the patient's body temperature to levels between {{convert|32|-|34|C|F}}, is used to help reduce the risk of the [[ischemic injury]] to the [[brain]] following a period of insufficient blood flow. Periods of insufficient blood flow may be caused by [[cardiac arrest]], [[stroke]], or [[acquired brain injury|brain trauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Polderman Kees H | year = 2004 | title = Application of therapeutic hypothermia in the ICU | url = | journal = Intensive Care Med. | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 556–575 | doi=10.1007/s00134-003-2152-x | pmid=14767591}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-invasively induced therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to reduce mortality of successfully resuscitated cardiac arrest victims by 35 percent and increase the chance of a good neurologic outcome by 39 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holzer Michael | year = 2002 | title = Mild Hypothermia to Improve the Neurologic Outcome After Cardiac Arrest | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 346 | issue = 8 | doi = 10.1056/nejmoa012689 | pmid=11856793 | pages=549–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Device description==
The Arctic Sun has been explained as dry water immersion. It is a non-invasive precision temperature management system that is used to induce hypothermia in comatose patients that have suffered from Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) and patients at risk for [[ischemic]] brain damage. The Arctic Sun has distinctive gel pads, which stick to a patient’s body using an adhesive called hydrogel—a substance that adheres to the skin without removing hair follicles. The gel pads cover only a portion of a patient’s body and subsequently leave most of the body free for augmenting medical procedures. The device operates under negative pressure and circulates water through these pads at a temperature between {{convert|4|-|42|C|F}}. Water is pulled through the pads, which minimizes the risk of leakage. By controlling the temperature of the water running through the gel pads, the Arctic Sun’s adjusts a patient’s temperature.  Arctic Sun can also rewarm patients. Controlled rewarming has been cited in the literature as beneficial in preventing reperfusion injury. Because of the Arctic Sun’s noninvasive nature, treatment can be delivered without the host of adverse events associated with invasive procedures such as cooling catheters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medivance.com/ Medivance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A former complaint levied against the Arctic Sun relates to the risk of skin injury.  A study published in 2007 found that the Arctic Sun was, "highly effective in lowering patients’ temperature rapidly without inducing skin irritations.".&lt;ref name="ASA"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haugk Moritz | year = 2007 | title = Feasibility and efficacy of new non-invasive cooling device in post resuscitation intensive care medicine | url = | journal = Resuscitation | volume = 75 | issue = | pages = 76–81 | doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.03.001 | pmid=17462808|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invasive cooling catheter companies have claimed that catheters can lower body temperature at a faster rate, which is relevant because most of the clinical data suggests that the sooner cooling initiates the better a patient’s outcome. However, there exists a 75 minute delay on average between admittance and catheter insertion.  Even with a physician readily available to place the cooling catheter, the operating instructions underline the importance of the device set up with takes a minimum of 25 minutes. When objectively evaluating the published data the average cooling rate for cooling catheters is 1.12°C.  Treatment with the Arctic Sun can be administered within 10 minutes by unsupervised nursing professionals.

Historically, clinicians reported that catheters cool at a quicker rate, however, a 2011 study published in the Society of Critical Care Medicine where 167 patients treated either with the Arctic Sun or the Alsius Coolgard Catheter showed the following:

There was no significant difference in survival with good neurologic function, either to hospital discharge or at follow-up. Time from cardiac arrest to achieving mild therapeutic hypothermia was equal with both devices (surface, 273 min, core, 270 min).”
* Cooling was initiated immediately in the emergency department on hospital arrival with ice packs around groin, armpits and neck and infusion of up to 3 L of refrigerated saline
* All patients were "deeply sedated"
* No device-specific patient injuries were observed; skin injuries with the Arctic Sun or DVT with Coolgard
* No differences in shivering: "
* Article quote: "Skin temperature is known to influence thermoregulatory control, and it previously has been speculated that core cooling could result in less shivering.
However, this could not be confirmed in the present study, because there was no difference in the rate of shivering in surface-cooled or core-cooled patients.”
* No differences were observed in Lengths of ICU stay, durations of respirator dependency, rates of MTH discontinuation, and post cooling

It was concluded that “Surface and core cooling of out-of hospital cardiac arrest patients following the same established postresuscitation treatment protocol resulted in similar survival to hospital discharge and comparable neurologic function at follow-up.”

In May 2008, the Arctic Sun was used to induce hypothermia in a 59-year-old woman in [[West Virginia]] who had suffered 3 cardiac arrests within a 24-hour period. For more than 17 hours the woman had no measurable brain waves, according to her doctors, and her heart had been stopped for a prolonged period of time. The family decided to take her off [[life support]]. Shortly after being disconnected from the [[ventilator]], the woman unexpectedly recovered, regaining consciousness, motor function, and speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4923465&amp;page=1 |author=Stone, Gigi |author2=Tracey Marx |author3=Stephanie Dahle |title=Doctor Calls Near-Death Experience a 'Miracle': Hospital Took Velma Thomas off Life Support &amp;ndash; Then She Woke Up. |publisher=abcnews.go.com |date= 24 May 2008 |accessdate= 27 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dailymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.com/News/200805200160 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20080720130624/http://www.dailymail.com/News/200805200160 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 July 2008 |last=Pettit |first=Zack |title=Son making funeral plans gets call that mom's alive: New apparatus helped stave off brain injury |publisher=Charleston Daily Mail |date=20 May 2008 |accessdate=27 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ClimbingAscenders.jpg|thumb|Two right-handed ascenders, left rigged for ascending, right shown open]]
[[File:Žumarování.JPG|thumb|Ascenders in use on a steep mountain slope, offering the two climbers both security plus an additional aid to their upward ascent. Note that they are not roped together, but are climbing independently of one another.]]
An '''ascender''' is a device (usually mechanical) used for directly ascending a rope, or for facilitating protection with a fixed rope when climbing on very steep mountain terrain. 

Ascenders can also be used as a braking component within a rope hauling system, often used in rescue situations. 

== Use ==
Ascenders are usually used in pairs, and offer similar functionality to [[friction hitch|friction knot]]s, but are faster, safer and easier to use,&lt;ref name="Fawcett" /&gt; albeit still with consequences in weight and in security (as ascenders can, even with a locking carabiner, come off the rope, and fail by shredding the rope at high loads, rather than slipping and fusing as with friction knots). A mechanical ascender employs a [[cam]] which allows the device to slide freely in the intended direction of movement, but provide a firm grip on the rope when pulled in the opposite direction. To prevent an ascender from accidentally coming off the rope, a locking mechanism or trigger is deployed. The ascender is first attached to the climber's harness by a piece of webbing or sling, and then is clipped onto the rope and locked on. 

Ascenders are usually used in pairs, so that one is free to be slid up the rope whilst the other bears the weight of the climber. The ascender which has just been slid upwards is then made to take the climbers load, so locking him to the rope, and freeing the other one so it, too, can then be slid upwards too. The process is then repeated to ascend the rope.&lt;ref name="Fawcett" /&gt; 

For climbing on with a fixed rope attached for security (for example, to snow anchors on a steep slope) only one ascender is used, keeping the other hand free for holding an [[ice axe]].

Ascenders are not typically used on [[free climbing]] routes, where a climber uses his or her hands and feet on the rock, climbing the features, edges, cracks, and pockets that the route provides without artificial aids. Instead, they are more likely to be used in [[aid climbing]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/55672068|title=Alpine climbing : techniques to take you higher|last=Houston|first=Mark|last2=Cosley|first2=Kathy|date=|publisher=Mountaineers Books|others=|year=2004|isbn=0898867495|location=Seattle, WA|pages=86|oclc=55672068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jumar==
One such ascender device is a jumar, named for its manufacturer Jümar Pangit, a company in turn named after jumar inventors Adolph Jüsi and Walter Marti. The first iteration of the tool was sold in 1958. The device's name also engendered the verb "to jumar" for the process of using such a device. In jumaring, the second climber (the one who [[belay]]s the lead climber on the route) uses ascenders to climb the rope instead of climbing directly on the rock. Other terms for this process include ascending and jugging.&lt;ref name="freedom"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]]|publisher=The Mountaineers|year=2003-09|isbn=0-89886-828-9|editor=Cox, Steven M.|edition=7|location=Seattle|editor2=Kris Fulsaas}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This process is similar to [[Prusik|prusiking]], except using an ascender device instead of friction knots.

== Non-mechanical devices ==
In place of mechanical ascenders, one or more thin rope slings (or [[prusik]] loops) may be used which can be slid along the thicker climbing rope when not under tension. These friction knots will lock under load to enable the climber to use the strength of their leg to step up and ascend the rope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ukclimbing.com/articles/skills/self_rescue_for_climbers_4_-_prusiking_up_a_rope-3627|title=Self Rescue for Climbers 4 - Prusiking Up a Rope|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fawcett&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ron|first1=Fawcett|last2=Jeff|first2=Lowe|last3=Paul|first3=Nunn|last4=Alan|first4=Rouse|title=Climbing|date=1986|publisher=Bell &amp; Hyman Ltd|isbn=0713526203}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46-48}} Prusik knots are much lighter, but are not capable of taking a dynamic load, such as arresting a falling climber, because they are prone to melting or fusing under such extreme forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Rope Techniques in Mountaineering|last=March|first=Bill|publisher=Cicerone Press|year=1983|isbn=0902363409|location=|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Single-rope technique==
In [[caving]], ascending a rope by means of mechanical devices is often necessary and is the main alternative to ladder use. This is termed [[Single-rope technique]]. The rock which forms the cave is often wet, slippery, relatively featureless and often unreachable from the necessary rope locations. So climbing the rope may well be preferable to climbing the rock or a ladder, provided that a belay location that provides an ascent has already been found. Although climbers may regard a climb as a challenge to be tackled with minimal aids, cavers are likely to consider it as an obstacle to their progress to be overcome as conveniently as possible, and are more inclined to make use of mechanical ascenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author=Elliot, Dave| title=Single rope technique: a training manual | year=1986 | publisher=Troll Safety Equipment | location=Oldham  | isbn=978-0-904405-68-2 | pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== History ==
The first mechanical rope ascending devices were created by Henri Brenot, and were used in France both for mountaineering and caving as early as 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Chevalier, Pierre ''Subterranean Climbers'' Faber &amp; Faber, London, 1951. {{ISBN|0-914264-14-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jümar Pangit, a Swiss manufacturer located then in [[Reichenbach im Kandertal|Reichenbach]] (Switzerland), was founded by Adolph Jüsi and Walter Marti. Jüsi was studying eagles for the Swiss government and needed to ascend on ropes in order to perform his work, so Marti developed the ascender for him. In 1958, the first jumar was introduced to the climbing market. [https://web.archive.org/web/20050729084811/http://storrick.cnchost.com/VerticalDevicesPage/Ascender/HandleEC.html This page] (archived) gives an overview on the older jumar models. A current model is still in production.

French caver [[Fernand Petzl]] developed a mechanical rope ascender in 1968, and his company [[Petzl]] continues to produce both handled and handleless models that are popular with mountaineers and cavers today.

Other countries, notably the United States, have also produced rope ascenders. Other names for different styles of ascenders include 'ropeman' and 'tibloc'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine''' ('''AAAM''') is a non-profit education and research organization founded in 1957 by the Medical Advisory committee to the [[Sports Car Club of America]].  It is the first and premier professional multidisciplinary [[organization]] dedicated entirely to the prevention and control of [[injuries]] from [[motor vehicle]] crashes.

AAAM is an international association with professionals representing more than 20 countries committed to reducing motor vehicle trauma and improving highway safety around the world.  Its strength lies in its membership representing medicine, engineering, biomechanics, law, education, and public policy.  This combination of clinical, research and administrative backgrounds forms a unique blend of leaders in traffic injury control and it is these professionals who comprise the AAAM membership.

The AAAM has furthered the development and publishes the [[Abbreviated Injury Scale]] (AIS), a widely used description system for individual injuries.  The Abbreviated Injury Scale is an internationally accepted tool for assessing the injury severity of individual injuries. It contains no information on injury aggregation. The AIS codebook is protected by copyright.

'''Baby powder''' is an [[astringent]] [[powder (substance)|powder]] used for preventing [[diaper rash]], as a [[deodorant]], and for other cosmetic uses.  It may be composed of [[talcum]] (in which case it is also called talcum powder) or [[corn starch]] (in which case it is also called corn starch).  Talcum powder is dangerous if inhaled since it may cause [[aspiration pneumonia]] or [[granuloma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harper|first=John|author2=Arnold Oranje |author3=Neil Prose |title=Textbook of Pediatric Dermatology|publisher=Blackwell Science|year=2000|page=156|isbn=0-86542-939-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pediatricians generally prefer cornstarch to talc because it is unlikely to be easily inhaled.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Baby powder can also be used as a [[shampoo]], [[cleaning agent]], and [[freshener]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/7271/lifehacks/20-brilliant-uses-for-baby-powder | title=20 Brilliant Uses for Baby Powder You’ve Never Considered | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=15 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BlogHer''' is a community and media company founded by Elisa Camahort Page, Jory des Jardins, and Lisa Stone in 2005. The company, Blogher LLC, includes conferences and a blog advertising network. In 2007, it expanded to include BlogHers Act, a political blogging network by and for women. [[Dan Gillmor]] quoted the site's community guideline "We embrace the spirit of civil disagreement" as an ideal.&lt;ref name=Guardian2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Gillmor|first=Dan|title=TechCrunch's teachable moment: media sites must own the conversation|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/25/techcrunch-teachable-moment-media-comment|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|accessdate=14 February 2013|location=London|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
BlogHer began as a conference in 2005 in San José, California. It began with an idea and a blog, and once announced, quickly grew to a 300-person conference on women and blogging. {{citation needed span|text= The BlogHer team in 2005 included Elisa Camahort,  Jenn Satterwhite,  Jory Des Jardins, Lisa Stone, Lisa Williams,  Maria Niles, Mir Verburg, and Toby Bloomberg.|date=July 2015}}

The second BlogHer conference was held in San José and was much larger than the first, with at least 750 attendees. {{citation needed span|text=Keynote speakers included [[Arianna Huffington]], [[Catarina Fake]], Caroline Little, Chris Nolan, Mena Trott, [[Grace Davis]], [[Meg Hourihan]], and [[Marnie Webb]].|date=July 2015}}

BlogHer '07 keynote speakers in Chicago include [[Rashmi Sinha]], [[Gina Bianchini]], [[Annalee Newitz]], [[Elizabeth Edwards]], and [[Esther Dyson]]. In 2007, the community events also expanded to a business blogging conference in March in New York City. BlogHer Business keynote speakers included Elisa Camahort, Jeannette Gibson, Stephanie Bergman, Rachel Clarke, Lisa Weinstein, Lisa Stone, Debi Fine, [[Marissa Mayer]], [[Stacy Morrison]], and Caroline Little.

In 2008, the BlogHer cofounders were honored with the [[Social Impact ABIE Award]] from [[the Anita Borg Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anitaborg.org/profiles/abie-award-winners/blogher-inc-co-founders/|title=BlogHer Inc Co-founders - AnitaB.org|date=2008-10-01|work=AnitaB.org|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anitaborg.org/awards-grants/abie-awards/|title=Abie Awards - AnitaB.org|last=|first=|date=|work=AnitaB.org|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2008, [[iVillage]], a network of online media outlets owned by [[NBC Universal]], announced that it had reached a partnership with the BlogHer network to provide content for sites across the iVillage network. Additionally, BlogHer received [[United States dollar|$]]5 million in funding from Peacock Ventures, NBC Universal's venture investment arm.&lt;ref name="TechCrunch"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/16/AR2008071602439_pf.html | title=BlogHer Inks Deal With NBC Universal, Raises $5 Million | publisher=TechCrunch | date=2008-07-16 | accessdate=2009-03-15 | last=Nye | first=Calley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blogher 2010 was held in [[New York City]] from August 6–7, at the [[Hilton New York]]. Blogher 2011 was held in [[San Diego]] in August. Blogher 2012 was held in [[New York City]] from August 2–5, at the [[Hilton New York]]. The conference was the largest ever, with more than 5,000 registered attendees. Many notable speakers were a part of the conference, including a live video appearance from President [[Barack Obama]]. Also featured were keynote sessions with [[Martha Stewart]], [[Katie Couric]], and a panel of celebrities-doing-good: [[Soledad O'Brien]] (moderator), former model [[Christy Turlington]] and Malaak-Compton Rock, a philanthropist and comedian Chris Rock's wife. Blogher 2013 was held in [[Chicago]] at [[McCormick Place]] from July 25–27, and featured speakers [[Guy Kawasaki]] and [[Sheryl Sandberg]].

On November 3, 2014, BlogHer was bought by [[SheKnows Media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://adage.com/article/media/sheknows-buys-blogher/295684/ | title=SheKnows Buys BlogHer, Expanding Its Reach Among Women | work=AdAge | date=November 3, 2014 | accessdate=November 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2015, Builddirect acquired DraftingSpace, a software company based in Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crompton|first1=Trish|title=BuildDirect Acquires DraftingSPACE, Plots Waterloo Office|url=http://www.techvibes.com/blog/builddirect-acquires-draftingspace-plots-waterloo-office-2015-06-10|website=TechVibes|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heavyweight Supply Chain   ==

The average weight of a BuildDirect product order is 1,500 pounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.builddirect.com/Shipping|title=BuildDirect® - Flooring, Decking, Siding, Roofing, and More|website=www.builddirect.com|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2014/12/10/builddirect-50-million-battle-lowes-home-depot/|title=Dot-Com Survivor BuildDirect Bets The House To Battle Lowe's and Home Depot|website=Forbes|accessdate=2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To ship these heavy materials, BuildDirect built a new system. The company utilizes an existing network of primary transporters including freight, rail, and truck to import products to North America, move them to warehouses, and deliver them to customers. BuildDirect also uses technology and a competitive bidding process to calculate delivery methods.&lt;ref name="cantech-20121127" /&gt;

=== Gateway Supply Chain ===

In February 2017, BuildDirect opened its global supply chain platform for heavyweight goods. The BuildDirect Gateway provides any third party access to BuildDirect's network of warehousing services, ground and ocean logistics for any part of the shipping process, from point of manufacture through last-mile delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/21/builddirect-opens-up-its-platform-for-heavyweight-shipping/|title=BuildDirect opens its freight-shipping platform|last=Lardinois|first=Frederic|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
BuildDirect has built its own proprietary analytics and forecasting tools; BuildDirect Demand Rank, BuildDirect Product Rank, and BuildDirect Inventory Rank. These tools are used to analyze product specific data relating to consumer interest, market competitiveness, and geographic performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OMERS Ventures|url = http://www.omersventures.com/builddirect.aspx|website = www.omersventures.com|access-date = 2016-02-10|last = OMERS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demand data is also available to suppliers, which provides opportunities for them to manage their own inventory planning, production and shipping.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In February 2016, BuildDirect launched the BuildDirect Home Marketplace; an online platform that connects consumers with home improvement products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The platform also offers a self-service model for sellers to onboard their products.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Locations ==

BuildDirect has many distribution points across North America, with 6 super warehouses in [[Vancouver|Vancouver B.C]]., [[Los Angeles]], [[Dallas]], [[Atlanta]], [[Chicago]], and [[New Jersey]]. The company headquarters is located in Vancouver, B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = BuildDirect® - Flooring, Decking, Siding, Roofing, and More|url = http://www.builddirect.com/Contact#warehouseLocations|website = www.builddirect.com|accessdate = 2015-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Single Lens Ceilometer.JPG|thumb|right|Laser ceilometer]]
A '''ceilometer''' is a device that uses a [[laser]] or other light source to determine the height of a [[Ceiling (cloud)|cloud ceiling]] or [[cloud base]]. Ceilometers can also be used to measure the [[aerosol]] concentration within the atmosphere. When based on laser, it is a type of [[atmospheric lidar]].

== Hazards ==
Ceilometers that use visible light can sometimes be fatal to birds, as the animals become disoriented by the light beams and suffer exhaustion and collisions with other birds and structures.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8005051/10000-birds-trapped-in-Twin-Towers-memorial-light.html 10,000 Birds Trapped In The World Trade Center, The Telegraph], The Telegraph, September 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the worst recorded ceilometer non-laser light beam incident, approximately 50,000 birds from 53 different species died at [[Robins Air Force Base|Warner Robins Air Force Base]] in the United States during one night in 1954.&lt;ref name="Johnston"&gt;{{cite journal

Laser ceilometers use invisible lasers to observe the cloud base. Using optical instruments such as binoculars near ceilometers is not recommended, because lenses in instruments could concentrate the beam and damage one's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.iag.co.at/uploads/tx_iagproducts/pdf_handbuch/CL31.de.pdf | title = Vaisala Ceilometer CL31 User'S Guide | website = www.iag.co.at|accessdate = 2015-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceilometers can be installed on angles{{clarify|date=October 2017}} in the approach of aircraft to a runway.

==Optical drum ceilometer==
An optical drum ceilometer uses [[triangulation]] to determine the height of a spot of light projected onto the base of the [[cloud]]. It consists essentially of a rotating projector, a detector, and a recorder. The projector emits an intense beam of light above into the sky at an angle that varies with the rotation. The detector, which is located at a fixed distance from the projector, uses a [[photodetector]] pointing vertically. When it detects the projected light return from the cloud base, the instrument notes the angle and the calculation gives the height of clouds.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Laser ceilometer==
A laser ceilometer consists of a vertically pointing laser and a receiver in the same location. A laser pulse with a duration on the order of nanoseconds is sent through the atmosphere. As the beam travels through the atmosphere, tiny fractions of the light are scattered by aerosols. Generally, the size of the particles in question are similar in size to the wavelength of the laser. This situation leads to [[Mie scattering]]. A small component of this scattered light is directed back to the [[lidar]] receiver. The timing of the received signal can be transformed into a spatial range, ''z'', by using the speed of light. That is,

:&lt;math&gt;distance = \frac {c \delta t}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where c is the light speed in the air.

In this way, each pulse of laser light results in a vertical profile of aerosol concentration within the atmosphere. Generally, many individual profiles will be averaged together in order to increase the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] and average profiles are reported on a time scale of seconds. The presence of clouds or water droplets leads to a very strong return signal compared to background levels, which allows for cloud heights to be easily identified.

For cloud base determination purpose, due to the ceilometer's ability to pick up any particle in the air (dust, [[precipitation]], smoke, etc.), it will give occasional false readings. As an example, depending on the threshold used, falling [[diamond dust]] (ice crystals) may cause the ceilometer to report a cloud height of zero, even though the sky is clear.

Using these last properties, ceilometers will have other uses. Since the instrument will note any returns, it is possible to locate any faint layer where it occurs, additionally to the cloud's base, by looking at the whole pattern of returned energy. Furthermore, the rate at which diffusion happens can be noted by the diminishing part returned to the ceilometer in clear air, giving the coefficient of extinction of the light signal. Using these data could give the vertical visibility and the possible concentration of air [[pollution|pollutants]]. This has been developed in research and could be applied for operational purpose.

== Volcanic ash detection ==
In New Zealand, MetService operates a network of laser ceilometers for cloud base measurements at commercial airports. These sensors are also used to map volcanic ash clouds to allow commercial air traffic to avoid damage caused by ash.

The different types of '''[[bladed weapons]]''' ([[Sword|swords]], [[Small sword|dress-swords]], [[Sabre|sabers]], [[Rapier|rapiers]], [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], [[Machete|machetes]], [[Dagger|daggers]], [[Knife|knives]], [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]], etc..) have been of great importance throughout history. In addition to its use for fighting, or in wars, the ''[[bladed weapons]]'' have been the object of special considerations forming part of funerary rituals, mythology and other ancestral traditions.

The manufacture of a [[Bladed weapons|''bladed weapon'']] of a certain quality (either of bronze or iron alloy) requires a certain degree of mastery in metallurgy: obtaining metals and alloys from the minerals of the mines, mastery on forging, casting or forming techniques and heat treatments; without forgetting the artistic aspects or the crafts related to the complements (pods, belts, shawls, knobs, decoration, etc...).

== Chronology details ==
The present [[chronology]] it's a compilation that includes diverse and relatively uneven documents about different families of ''[[bladed weapons]]'': [[Sword|swords]], [[Small sword|dress-swords]], [[Sabre|sabers]], [[Rapier|rapiers]], [[Foil (fencing)|foils]], [[Machete|machetes]], [[Dagger|daggers]], [[Knife|knives]], [[Arrowhead|arrowheads]], etc..., with the sword references being the most numerous but not the unique included among the other listed references of the rest of ''[[bladed weapons]]''. The reason to group them into a single list responds to a goal for simplification, instead of making a different [[chronology]] article for each type of bladed weapon.

== Chronology (until the Christian Era) ==

=== Bronze Swords ===
[[File:Nebra_Schwerter.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt; [[Sword]]s found next to [[Nebra sky disk]] &lt;/Center&gt;]]
The first bronze swords with a length equal to or greater than 60&amp;nbsp;cm date from the 17th century BC in regions of the [[Black Sea]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. They emerged as an evolution of shorter weapons of the type of the daggers or daggers. To make a sword useful in combat, you must have a correct alloy, give it the right shape and apply the necessary thermal (and finishing) treatments. The longer a sword, the stresses (bending and buckling) are more important. What is needed is a weapon that is hard enough (to cut), fairly flexible (without being fragile) and quite tenacious enough to withstand the blows in the fights.

The manufacturing process is summarized as follows: The bronze swords were cast into moulds, heated to a certain temperature and allowed to cool slowly. Finally they cold hammered (hitting them with a hammer on a type of anvil) to increase its hardness.

'''DBmaestro''' is computer software service company with sales headquartered near [[Boston]], and development in [[Petah Tikva]], Israel. It markets its services for [[DevOps]]: collaboration between development and IT operations teams.

==History==
DBmaestro was co-founded in 2008 by Yariv Tabac who became chief executive, and Yaniv Yehuda who became chief technical officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Database Development without Enforced Roles and responsibilities is a reckless security risk |url = http://www.dbmaestro.com/2015/04/database-development-without-enforced-roles-and-responsibilities-is-a-reckless-security-risk/ |work= Company blog |author= Yariv Tabac |date= April 17, 2015 |access-date= April 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Yaniv Yehuda|url = http://www.cmcrossroads.com/users/yaniv-yehuda|website = CMCrossroads|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was founded in Israel, and competes with [[Redgate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Applied Rapid Development Techniques for Database Engineers |author= Dominic Delmolino |date= January 31, 2012 |publisher= Redgate |url= http://allthingsoracle.com/applied-rapid-development-techniques-for-database-engineers/ |access-date= April 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DBmaestro's DevOps Suite software focuses on [[database]] development and controls application specific data.
DBmaestro integrates with other technology such as [[Oracle Database]] and [[Microsoft SQL Server]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title = DBmaestro Pushes DevOps Into Microsoft SQL Server Shops |author= Pedro Hernandez |work= eWeek |date= April 10, 2014 |url = http://www.eweek.com/database/dbmaestros-teamwork-pushes-devops-into-microsoft-sql-server-shops.html |access-date= April 15, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DBmaestro Brings DevOps for Database to Microsoft SQL Server|url = http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/04/DBmaestro|website = InfoQ|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DBmaestro Now Supports SQL Server and Oracle|url = http://www.dbta.com/Editorial/News-Flashes/DBMaestro-TeamWork-Now-Supports-SQL-Server-and-Oracle-96243.aspx|website = Database Trends and Applications|date = 2014-04-09|accessdate = 2015-11-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DBmaestro [[software as a service]] is designed to reduce errors in database branch merges, prevent unintended database drift, expedite database changes, limit inter-team asynchronicity, ensure compliance, improve change logs and change storage, and decrease the responsibilities of [[database administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Perion Database Change Management Case Study|url = http://www.dbmaestro.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/perion.pdf|website = DBmaestro|date = 2014-08-15|accessdate = 2016-09-26|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DBmaestro Opens Relational Database Change Management API|url = http://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/it-unmasked/dbmaestro-opens-relational-database-change-management-api.html|website = www.itbusinessedge.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, DBmaestro was recognized by the editors of [[SD Times]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The 2015 SD Times 100: 'Best in Show' in Software Development|url = http://sdtimes.com/sdtimes-100/2015/best-in-show/database-database-management-2015/|website = SDTimes|accessdate = 2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computing (magazine)|Computing]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Computing Vendor Excellence Awards shortlist announced|url = http://www.computing.co.uk/ctg/news/2410216/computing-vendor-excellence-awards-shortlist-announced|website = www.computing.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5713">[[File:Domino Logic Gates.svg|thumb|The two domino logic gates, from which all others can be built. The XOR gate is dependent on timing.]]
A '''domino computer''' is a [[mechanical computer]] built using [[dominoes]]&lt;ref name=domcom&gt;[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1764437 Domino computer]&lt;/ref&gt;  to represent mechanical [[Operational amplifier|amplification]] or [[Logic gate|logic gating]] of [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s. Because of the existence of multiple schemes, '''domino computer''' will be used in this article to denote any particular scheme that uses the mentioned base phenomenon (of domino sequences) for building machines equivalent to a computer. This choice of terminology may be somewhat arbitrary, because only few resources write on this topic.&lt;ref name=comdomcon&gt;[http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html Domino computers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060816075615/http://www.pinkandaint.com/oldhome/comp/dominoes/index.html |date=August 16, 2006 }}, a detailed description written by [http://www.pinkandaint.com/ David Johnston]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Basic phenomenon ==

Sequences of standing [[dominoes]] (so that each topples the next one) can be arranged to demonstrate digital concepts such as [[amplifier|amplification]] and [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]]s. It is some digital information that is conducted by a string of dominoes, thus this effect differs from [[Phenomenon|phenomena]] where:
* ''energy'' is conducted ''without amplification'', thus dissipating; or
* ''amplification'' is applied to non-digital signals, allowing noise effects to occur.

The [[Domino Day]] event shows many constructs, mainly with purpose of entertainment. Some constructs may remind people of [[digital circuit]]s. Some of them suggest that not only telegraph-like tools can be shown, but also simple [[information processing]] modules can be built.

It is possible to use this [[phenomenon]] for constructing [[unconventional computing]] tools.&lt;ref name=domcom/&gt;&lt;ref name=comdomcon/&gt;&lt;ref name=moldom&gt;James Maguire: [http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/19781.html IBM Creates Molecular Computer Circuit] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719210141/http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/19781.html |date=July 19, 2006 }} NewsFactor Magazine Online, 2006. A topic in the intersection of [[Molecular computer|molecular computing]] and domino computer&lt;/ref&gt; The base phenomenon is sufficient to achieve this goal,&lt;ref name=comdomcon/&gt; but also sophisticated “mechanical synapses” can be used (see online &lt;ref name=per-domtop&gt;Perrucci, Mike: [http://www.mazeguy.net/dominoes.html Domino Toppling].&lt;/ref&gt;), to the analogy of [[electrical synapse]]s or [[chemical synapse]]s.

==Logical aspects==
The logic gate OR is very natural in dominoes.
The problem is which gate we should add to OR, and obtain a functionally complete set.
Note that no domino gate can produce output 1 with all inputs 0,
so we cannot make NOT, therefore we cannot even make IMPLIES without an external 'power source' sequence.
Once we admit it, NOT is realized and we have a complete set.

But it is however distant to lead in a sequence from one source to many gates in each suitable timing.
Let us suppose we do not have one.

A root breaking system is basically needed if one wants a logical connective with output 0 for input 1.
Let P$Q be the gate in which the sequence to be turned down by P is broken by that by Q.
Then P$Q is logically equivalent to P AND (NOT Q), if the input Q is earlier than P.
The set of OR and $ can represent any logical connectives in any arity except for ones which generates 1 with all inputs 0.

Similarly, XOR can be realized with the gate in a diagram above as a bi-root breaking system.

The problems of these two  root breaking systems is that they heavily depend on the simultaneity of two inputs.
In the gate of XOR one input may destroy the opposite input root tracking back.
Note that the expression of P AND Q, P$(P$Q) OR Q$(Q$P) is symmetric,
hence does not depend on the simultaneity, and with no worry of tracking back, though it is complicated.

==Record==
The current record for domino computers is a 5 bit adder.

At the Manchester Science Festival in 2012, mathematician [[Matt Parker]] and a team of volunteers worked together to build a domino binary adder which could add two three-bit inputs and produce a 4-bit output, which ran successfully. The following day, they attempted to build a 5-bit adder, which they completed, but the final test run had some errors (one due to signal bleed between chains of dominoes, and one timing issue).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w&lt;/ref&gt;

At American British Academy (ABA), Muscat, a team of Grade 12 students lead by Saatvik Suryajit Korisepati, supported by Alex Freyer, Zoltan Sojitory and rest of computers students had executed a 5-bit adder which will be able to add any numbers up to the sum of 63. The previous world record is a 4-bit adder that can only add up numbers up to 31. They had used 15,000 dominoes to build the circuit at Bank Muscat headquarters Oman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.omanobserver.om/aba-oman-students-set-world-record-for-dominoes-circuit/&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dry run''' (or a '''practice run'''{{hsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/2009/07/dry-run/ |title=Dry Run « The Word Detective |publisher=Word-detective.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a testing process where the effects of a possible failure are intentionally mitigated. For example, an aerospace company may conduct a “dry run” test of a jet’s new pilot ejection seat while the jet is parked on the ground, rather than while it is in flight.

The usage of “dry run” in acceptance procedures (for example in the so-called FAT = [[acceptance testing|factory acceptance testing]]) is meant as following: the factory – which is a subcontractor – must perform a complete test of the system it has to deliver ''before'' the actual acceptance by customer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12344">[[File:Flarm in rega helicopter.jpg|thumb|right|A FLARM system installed in a REGA helicopter. Most helicopters in Europe already have FLARM.]]
[[Image:FLARM logo.png|thumb|right|FLARM Logo]]
'''FLARM''' is an electronic system used to selectively alert pilots to potential collisions between aircraft. It is not formally an implementation of [[ADS-B]], as it is optimized for the specific needs of light aircraft, not for long-range communication or ATC interaction. FLARM is a [[portmanteau]] of "flight" and "alarm". The installation of all FLARM devices is approved as a [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] Standard Change&lt;ref name=cstan2&gt;[https://www.easa.europa.eu/system/files/dfu/CS-STAN%20-%20Issue%202.pdf CS-STAN Issue 2]&lt;/ref&gt;, and PowerFLARM Core specifically has been approved as a Minor Change by EASA&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/powerflarm-mca-approved-by-easa/ PowerFLARM MCA approved by EASA]&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to the Standard Change, the Minor Change approves PowerFLARM Core to be used during IFR and at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/shop/easa-minor-change-approval-mca/ EASA Minor Change Approval]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==

FLARM obtains its position and altitude readings from an internal [[Global positioning system|GPS]] and a [[barometric sensor]] and then broadcasts this together with forecast data about the future 3D flight track. At the same time, its receiver listens for other FLARM devices within range and processes the information received. Advanced motion prediction [[algorithm]]s predict potential conflicts for up to 50 other aircraft and alert the pilot using visual and aural warnings. FLARM has an integrated obstacle [[collision warning system]] together with an obstacle database. The database includes both point and segmented obstacles, such as split power lines and cableways.

Unlike conventional [[transponder]]s, FLARM has low power consumption and is relatively inexpensive to purchase and install. Furthermore, conventional [[Airborne Collision Avoidance System]]s (ACAS) are not effective in preventing light aircraft from colliding with each other as light aircraft can be close to each other without danger of collision. ACAS would issue continuous and unnecessary warnings about all aircraft in the vicinity, whereas FLARM only issues selective warnings about collision risks.

== Appraisal and attention ==

FLARM Technology and the inventors of FLARM have won several awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerokurier.de/general-aviation/motorflug/aerokurier-innovation-award-verliehen/621164?special_id=612932 FLARM wins aerokurier Innovation Award]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/flarm-awarded-at-aero-2012/ FLARM awarded at AERO 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fai.org/news/31951-fai-news-07-07 FLARM wins Prince Alvaro de Orleans Borbon Prize for technical innovation in air sports]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.ostiv.org/o_fame.htm OSTIV-Prize] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201100558/http://old.ostiv.org/o_fame.htm |date=2016-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss Office of Civil Aviation (FOCA) also published&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/BFU_1854_WispileMidair.pdf Safety recommendation]&lt;/ref&gt; in Dec 2010: "''The rapid distribution of such systems only a few months after their introduction was not accomplished through regulatory measures, but rather on a voluntary basis and as a result of the wish on the part of the involved players to contribute towards the reduction of collision risk. The FOCA recommends that glider tow planes and helicopters that operate in lower airspace should also use collision warning systems''."

In addition, FLARM is mandatory in several countries including France,&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/FFVV_CirculaireFlarmEN.pdf FLARM mandatory in France]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Soaring Society of America (SSA) strongly recommends FLARM in lieu of ADS-B Out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.org/GeneralNews?show=blog&amp;id=4035 Soaring Society of America (SSA) strongly recommends FLARM in lieu of ADS-B Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versions ==

Versions are sold for use in light aircraft, helicopters, and gliders. Newer PowerFLARM models extend the FLARM range to over 10&amp;nbsp;km. They also have an integrated ADS-B and transponder Mode-C/S receiver, making it possible to also avoid mid-air collisions with large aircraft.

Newer devices can also act as authorized flight recorders by producing files in the [[FAI Gliding Commission#GNSS flight recorders|IGC]] [[filename extension|format]] defined by the [[FAI Gliding Commission]]. All FLARM devices can be connected to FLARM displays or compatible avionics (EFIS, moving map, etc.) to give visual and aural warnings and also to show the intruder's position on the map. Licensed manufacturers produce integrated FLARM devices in different [[avionics]] products. FLARM devices can issue spoken warnings similar to TCAS.

== Hardware ==
[[File:LXFlarm RedBox Hardware.png|thumb|LX FLARM Red Box remote transceiver unit]]
A typical FLARM system consists of the following hardware components:
* Central microcontroller for data processing, e.g. [[Atmel AVR]]
* [[Industrial, Scientific and Medical band|ISM]]/[[Short_Range_Devices|SRD]] band transceiver, e.g. NRF905 (Europe: 868 MHz)
* GPS module, e.g. U-blox LEA-4S
* Barometric pressure sensor, which measures cabin pressure to estimate the altitude (not used for collision avoidance, which uses GPS altitude)
* Traffic and collision warning display, e.g. [[LED|light emitting diodes]] or [[LCD|LC display]] and a [[Buzzer|buzzer]] (not installed in case of special remote units)
* [[Secure_Digital|(micro)SD]] card slot for configuration, logging and firmware updates
* [[RS-232]] interface for external displays and firmware updates

== Protocol ==

The FLARM radio protocol has always been encrypted, which is reasoned by the manufacturer to ensure the integrity of the system and also because of privacy and security considerations. Version 4 used in 2008 and Version 6 used in 2015 were [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineered]] despite its encryption.&lt;ref name=protocol&gt;[http://www.dotmana.com/weblog/wp-content/uploads/FLARM-RADIO-PROTOCOL-VERSION-4-2008.txt FLARM PROTOCOL VERSION 4 (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://pastebin.com/YK2f8bfm FLARM PROTOCOL VERSION 6 (2015)]&lt;/ref&gt;However, FLARM changes the protocol on a regular basis {{citation needed span|text=to add functionality and protect security|reason=Who says that?|date=February 2016}}.

The decryption of the FLARM radio protocol might be illegal, especially in EU countries. Article 6 of EU Directive 2013/40/EU&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32013L0040&amp;from=EN Directive 2013/40/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 August 2013 on attacks against information systems]&lt;/ref&gt; states that "''[...] intercepting, by technical means, non-public transmissions of computer data to, from or within an information system, including electromagnetic emissions from an information system carrying such computer data, intentionally and without right, is punishable as a criminal offence [...]''".  "Information system" is defined in Article 2 as "''a device or group of interconnected or related devices, one or more of which, pursuant to a programme, automatically processes computer data, as well as computer data stored, processed, retrieved or transmitted by that device or group of devices for the purposes of its or their operation, use, protection and maintenance''". The Convention on Cybercrime&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/rms/0900001680081561 Convention on Cybercrime CETS No.185]&lt;/ref&gt; has a similar text in its Article 3. The Convention on Cybercrime has been ratified by most signatory countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/185/signatures?p_auth=KQ1dEX3w Chart of signatures and ratifications of Treaty 185]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{citation needed span|text=It is questionable, however,|reason=By whom?|date=September 2017}} if encrypted traffic advisory data, published in agreement of the operator to be received by an undetermined number of other aviation participants, enforces cybercrime data protection claims if the data is being decrypted solely for the purpose of nearby traffic advisory by third party systems, which is the intended use of the system. In addition, it is not clear if the data processed by the FLARM system can reasonably be considered "non-public", as it could be argued that the vast majority of users install the device in order to freely broadcast their position to other airspace users in order to reduce the chance of collisions and thereby implicitly allow other parties access to the signal. That is the only function of the system.

The radio protocol has been criticised for its proprietary encryption, including a petition encouraging a change to an open protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aerokurier.de/luftsport/segelflug/codierung-schadet-der-sicherheit-petition-gegen-flarm-verschluesselung/629798|title=Petition gegen FLARM-Verschlüsselung|last=|first=|date=2015-05-28|website=aerokurier.de|language=de|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been argued that encryption increases processing time and contradicts the goal to increase aviation safety due to a closed monopoly market, because an open protocol could enable third party manufacturers to develop compatible devices, spreading the use of interoperable traffic advisory systems.
FLARM Technology opposed these claims as published on the petition page and published a white paper&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/newsroom/white-papers/compatibility/ System Design and Compatibility]&lt;/ref&gt; explaining the design of the system. They offer the technology to third parties&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/products/oem-module/ OEM Module]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flarm.com/products/powerflarm/product-selector/ FLARM Product Selector]&lt;/ref&gt;, which requires the implementation of the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] circuit board in compatible devices. Radio protocol specifications and crypto keys are not shared to third party manufacturers.

While the FLARM serial data protocol is public, the prediction engine of FLARM is patented by [[ONERA|Onera]] (France)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent |country=US |number=6438492 |status=patent |title=Device for improving the security of aircraft in visual flight regime|gdate=August 20, 2002 |fdate=July 2, 1999 |invent1=Claude Le Tallec|invent2=Boris Gravier |assign1=Onera|class=	G08G5/04 |accessdate=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Property|proprietary]]. It is licensed to manufacturers by FLARM Technology in Switzerland.

== Company ==

FLARM was founded by Urs Rothacher and Andrea Schlapbach in 2003, who were later joined by Urban Mäder in 2004.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://flarm.com/about-us/history/ FLARM Company History]&lt;/ref&gt; First sales were made in early 2004. Currently there are nearly 30,000 FLARM-compatible devices (around half of them produced by FLARM Technology, the rest by licensed manufacturers who have now overtaken FLARM in current sales) in use mainly in [[Switzerland]], [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], the [[Benelux]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Hungary]], [[Israel]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]].

FLARM's technology is also used in ground-based vehicles including vehicles used in [[Surface mining|surface-mining]]. These products are designed and produced by the Swiss company [[SAFEmine]], now being owned by Swedish Hexagon Group.

A '''foot towel''' is a small, rectangular [[towel]] which, in the absence of a rug, [[carpet]] or [[bathroom]] mat, is placed onto the bathroom floor to dry the feet on emerging from the shower or bath.

Craig Kelston is believed to be the inventor of the foot towel which dates back to 1532.
[[Image:pescatowel.jpg|thumb|Foot Towel with a fish stamp]]

==Usage==

The use of the foot towel is not widespread. A reason for this may be the fact that it tends to slip and slide around on tiled floors and does not have the same grip or [[friction]] of a rug, carpet or mat. However, some of the more recently produced foot towels include a specially designed under-surface, which improves grip and makes use safer.

There are two main types of foot towel:

* A large foot towel with space for both feet can be employed
* Two separate and smaller foot towels can be placed side by side to serve the same purpose. This allows one to widen the distance between both towels. The disadvantage being potential separation of the towels which could result in injury to the user.

Both varieties of foot towel are widely available.

==Appearance==

As with regular bath towels, foot towels come in a variety of colours. Decorative foot towels can be purchased, albeit at a higher price. Some foot towel manufacturers feature landscapes and cartoon characters on their products.

==Technological development==

The Integrated Convertible Foot Towel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/20060288477.html Integrated convertible foot towel - Patent 20060288477&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; enables an individual to dry his or her feet without stooping or bending over, and without putting a towel or rug on the floor.

'''GamersGate AB''' (formerly '''Gamer's Gate''') is a Sweden-based online [[video game]] store offering electronic [[strategy guide]]s&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.gamershell.com/news_81204.html Prima Strategy Guides via GamersGate]". ''Gamershell.com''. 30 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and games for Windows, OS X, and Linux via [[direct download link|direct download]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thatvideogameblog.com/2009/04/03/review-gamers-gate-pc-digital-download-service/ | title=Review / GamersGate (PC digital download service) | last=Lawler | first=Tommy | work=That VideoGame Blog | date=4 March 2009 | accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a competitor to online video game services such as [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[GOG.com]], [[Direct2Drive]], and [[Impulse (content delivery)|Impulse]].

GamersGate sells games for over 250 publishers and developers, including [[Electronic Arts]], [[Atari]], [[Bethesda Softworks]], [[2K Games]], [[Ubisoft]], [[SEGA]], [[Capcom]], [[Paradox Interactive]] and [[Epic Games]] as well as smaller [[independent video game development|independent developers]] such as [[2D Boy]], [[Jonathan Blow]] and [[Amanita Design]]. {{As of|September 2014}}, there are over 6000 games available through GamersGate.&lt;ref name=gamersgateaboutus&gt;{{cite web | work=GamersGate | title=About GamersGate | url= http://www.gamersgate.com/info/about-us|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of GamersGate was conceived by [[Paradox Interactive]] in 2004&lt;ref name=caoili08&gt;Caoili, Eric. "[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112397/GamersGate_Launches_Microtransactions_Platform.php GamersGate Launches Microtransactions Platform]". ''[[Gamasutra]]''. 9 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; after numerous fan requests for better access to Paradox's games were finally answered in the form of direct downloads. After Paradox sold a game to an Argentine fan via a download link that was later removed, word spread on the Paradox forums and international fans began asking if they too could purchase video games through downloads.&lt;ref name=reid&gt;Reid, Christos. "[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_212/6304-Gateway-to-Gaming Alternative Access: Gateway to Gaming]" (cont. [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/issues/issue_212/6304-Gateway-to-Gaming.2 p.2]). ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. Issue 212. 28 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking to provide cheap distribution of games to countries that did not offer them in physical retail stores, Paradox developed a [[digital distribution in video games|digital distribution]] system called "Paradox on Demand"&lt;ref name=reid/&gt; and commenced trial operations in April 2006. On 20 November 2006, the system was officially launched under the name "Gamer's Gate". Interest in the service grew such that in 2008, after other publishers requested that Gamer's Gate distribute their games as well, Paradox decided to separate the service into an independent company called "GamersGate".&lt;ref name=globenewswire&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/news.html?d=109087 |title=Paradox Interactive Launches Large-Scale International Digital Distribution Service |date=20 November 2006 |publisher=GlobeNewswire |accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2009, GamersGate was offering 1000 video game titles.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, James. "[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamersgate-catalog-surpasses-1000-titles GamersGate catalogue surpasses 1000 titles]". ''Gameindustry.biz''. 21 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By April of the following year, they had doubled their offering to 2000 titles.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamersgate-celebrates-2-000th-title-available-for-sale-digital-distribution-is-booming GamersGate celebrates 2,000th title available for sale]". ''Gamesindustry.biz''. 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; An additional 1000 games were added in 2011, bringing the company's total to 3000 games.&lt;ref name=caoili11&gt;Caoili, Eric. "[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/125342/GamersGate_To_Launch_AdSupported_FreeGames.php GamersGate To Launch Ad-Supported FreeGames]". ''[[Gamasutra]]''. 9 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern has repeated each year with 4000 games offered in 2012, 5000 offered in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/read/leading-digital-distribution-platform-gamersgate-announces-massive-summer-sale/0118292 LEADING DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM GAMERSGATE ANNOUNCES MASSIVE SUMMER SALE]".

==Features==
As a digital distribution company, GamersGate offers [[digital rights management]]-free (DRM-free) games and [[downloadable content]] (DLC) for PC, Mac, Linux, and Android platforms. GamersGate is a client-free service that does not require users to [[log on]] in order to play purchased games. In a January 2012 article for ''[[Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]'' magazine, columnist Shamus Young speculated that these features would appeal to gamers opposed to the passive DRM validation, [[always-on DRM]], and mandatory client program downloads that were common to many of GamersGate's top competitors.&lt;ref name=young&gt;Young, Shamus. "[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/9374-Digital-Distribution-The-Other-Guys Experienced Points: Digital Distribution: The Other Guys]" (cont. [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/columns/experienced-points/9374-Digital-Distribution-The-Other-Guys.2 p.2]). ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. 27 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; GamersGate accepts online payment by credit card or cash via [[Rixty]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.gamershell.com/news_115344.html GamersGate and Rixty Sign Deal: Flexible cash payment options for the GamersGate website]". ''Gamershell.com''. Accessed 11 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; From 2012-2013, it offered a catalog of free games via its Void system.&lt;ref name=wittenkeller&gt;Wittenkeller, Josh. "[http://www.gamezebo.com/2012/05/22/gamersgate-officially-announces-ad-supported-free-games-platform-void Gamersgate officially announces ad-supported free games platform VOID]". ''[[Gamezebo]]''. 22 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

GamersGate is one of the earliest digital distribution sites&lt;ref name=nunneley&gt;Nunneley, Stephany. "[http://www.vg247.com/2010/07/23/impulse-and-gamersgate-dont-agree-with-npd-digital-sales-results Impulse and GamersGate don't agree with NPD digital sales results]". ''[[VG247]]''. 23 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and has undergone major aesthetic redesigns over the years. The first major redesign occurred in May 2009&lt;ref&gt;Ziemer, Joe. "[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gamersgate-digital-distribution-site-gets-a-lick-of-paint GamersGate: Digital distribution site gets a lick of paint]". ''Gameindustry.biz''. 20 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; when they adopted a design that ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'''s Alec Meer described as "[[GOG.com|GoG]]-esque" and "shiny".&lt;ref&gt;Meer, Alec. "[http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/05/27/gamersgate-redesigned-crazy-sales GamersGate: Redesigned, Crazy Sales]". ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]''. 27 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The second redesign occurred in July 2011&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Erin. "[http://www.gamezebo.com/2011/07/22/gamersgatecom-gets-overhaul-adds-achievements-amp-more GamersGate.com gets an overhaul, adds achievements &amp; more]". ''[[Gamezebo]]''. 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and was interpreted by some as a response to changes in the industry including the launch of [[Origin (digital distribution software)|Origin]] and the acquisitions of [[Direct2Drive]] by [[GameFly]] and [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]] by [[GameStop]].&lt;ref&gt;Meer, Alec. "[http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/07/22/gamersgate-redesign A New Suit Of Clothes For GamersGate]". ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]''. 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downloadable content and developer tools===
GamersGate was one of the earliest video game stores to offer [[downloadable content]] for PC games, starting with downloadable content for the ''[[Hearts of Iron]]'' and ''[[Europa Universalis]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;Tanelon, James. "[http://www.wargamer.com/article/3596/editorial-the-paradoxical-pay-policy Editorial: The Paradoxical Pay Policy]". ''[[The Wargamer (website)|The Wargamer]]''. 24 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Quintin. "[http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2010/08/26/online-outlined-paradox-connect-announced Online Outlined: Paradox Connect Announced]". ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]''. 26 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, GamersGate began offering developers MicroSuite, a free in-game downloadable-content [[API]] that allows game companies to insert DLC [[microtransaction]]s into gameplay.&lt;ref name=caoili08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/12/09/gamersgate-launches-new-micro-transaction-platform/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210135535/http://venturebeat.com/2008/12/09/gamersgate-launches-new-micro-transaction-platform/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-12-10 |title=GamersGate launches new micro-transaction platform |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |date=2008-12-08 |accessdate=23 August 2011 |work=[[VentureBeat]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of MicroSuite came only a few months after GamersGate's release of the GameNerve Publishing Suite, a management tool allowing users to publish and digitally distribute newly created games in order to maximize profits for the creator rather than an intermediate distribution company.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. "[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/110099/Gamersgate_Announces_GameNerve_Publishing_Suite.php Gamersgate Announces GameNerve Publishing Suite]". ''[[Gamasutra]]''. 23 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Client-free===
GamersGate initially required a [[software client]] for its customers to download their purchased games, but on 28 January 2009, the company began allowing customers to download games through a micro-download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/press-releases/gamersgate-to-offer-ldquo-client-free-rdquo-experience/0130609| work=[[Develop (magazine)|Develop]] | last=Zeimer | first=Joel | date=28 January 2009 | accessdate=23 August 2011 | title=GamersGate to Offer"Client-Free" Experience}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this system, every game is associated with a small corresponding program that, when downloaded, will retrieve the install files for the customer's computer. Upon retrieval, the user installs the game and may then remove the downloader from the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/25/review-gamersgate-an-alternative-direct-download-games-service/ | title=Review: GamersGate, an alternative direct-download games service | last=Coldewey | first=Devin | work=[[TechCrunch]] | date=25 February 2009 | accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO Theo Bergquist has touted the client-less feature of GamersGate as a way to distinguish it from more dominant video game distribution platforms like [[Valve Corporation|Valve]]'s [[Steam (software)|Steam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/107625-GamersGate-CEO-Were-Not-Afraid-of-Steam/ | title=GamersGate CEO: "We're Not Afraid of Steam" | last=Chalk | first=Andy | work=[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]] | date=8 February 2011 | accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DRM-free===
Since its inception, GamersGate has eschewed the use of controversial [[digital rights management]] (DRM) schemes common to other digital video game distribution services. Games downloaded from GamersGate are released free of passive DRM validation and [[always-on DRM]], and GamersGate users have the option of transferring purchased games to other accounts.&lt;ref name=reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=young/&gt; Company CEO Theo Bergquist has emphasized the need for digital distribution companies to trust consumers. Although the potential for [[video game piracy]] and similar abuses are present through its method, GamersGate believes that trust in consumers acts as "a source of comfort" for its customers.&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Susan. "[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/93540-Digital-Distribution-Is-a-Matter-of-Trust Digital Distribution Is a Matter of Trust]". ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. 31 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The company has sought to work against piracy by cultivating mutual respect between itself and its strong player community.&lt;ref name=rosen/&gt; In an article for ''Information &amp; Communications Technology Law'', Peter Holm suggests that perhaps GamersGate's best DRM-free defense against piracy is simply that it makes the legal purchase of games easy and cheap.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Peter. "Piracy on the simulated seas: the computer games industry's non-legal approaches to fighting illegal downloads of games". ''Information &amp; Communications Technology Law''. Vol.23, Issue 1. Pp.61-76. 2014. DOI 10.1080/13600834.2014.899770&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to GamersGate's customer-friendly policies, rulings by the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]] on the topic of digital [[right of first sale]] have clarified that lessors who indefinitely license software thereby exhaust their property rights to the software.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-07/cp120094en.pdf Judgment in Case C-128/11: UsedSoft GmbH v.

[[Court of Justice of the European Union]]. Luxembourg. 3 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this ruling is that European digital distribution customers may resell downloaded games on the secondary market. Because GamersGate is based in Sweden and serves French, German, Italian, Polish, Spanish, and Swedish customers, this ruling has significance for GamersGate's European sales.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Walker (journalist)|Walker, John]].

Initially distributing only PC games, GamersGate began offering Mac games in June 2009&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141087/2009/06/gamersgate.html | accessdate=23 August 2011 | date=10 June 2009 | last=Cohen | first=Peter | work=[[Macworld]] | title=GamersGate makes play for Mac gamers }}&lt;/ref&gt; and later added Linux games and Android games.&lt;ref&gt;Peeples, Jemery.

Because it was formed as a split from a strategy game developer, the majority of the company's initial offerings were strategy war games. However, as third party developers signed on to distribute with Gamersgate, the site's offerings became increasingly eclectic. ''Rock, Paper, Shotgun'''s [[Kieron Gillen]] noted in 2008 that GamersGate's Top 10 Sales chart provided "a snapshot of a completely alien PC gaming world" with obscure but meritorious titles outperforming mainstream titles. Gillen suggested that this was evidence that "downloadable games enable niches."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kieron Gillen|Gillen, Kieron]]. "[http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/14/gamersgate-top-10-analysis Gamersgate Top 10 analysis]". ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]''. 14 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This pattern has lessened through the years but has never entirely disappeared. ''[[New Tang Dynasty Television]]'' drew attention to GamersGate's charts in 2014, when the free-to-play co-op game ''[[Warframe]]'' ranked alongside ''[[Castle of Illusion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

GamersGate frequently offers special deals and sales on its inventory. It has been praised by critics for its innovative [[product bundling|bundling]] that, during some sales, allows purchasers to opt out of individual games enclosed within the bundle for a reduction in the bundle's price.&lt;ref&gt;Peeples, Jeremy.

GamersGate officially launched the follow-up program to FreeGames, christened "Void", on 28 May 2012. Like FreeGames, the service allowed customers with an account to download certain games for free in exchange for watching a few short advertisements.&lt;ref name=wittenkeller/&gt; At release, nearly 100 games were available in the Void catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=GamersGate |title=VOID - GamersGate |url=http://www.gamersgate.com/void?skipintro=1 |accessdate=12 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531022811/http://www.gamersgate.com/void?skipintro=1 |archivedate=May 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company ended the Void service in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=GamersGate |title=VOID - GamersGate |url=http://www.gamersgate.com/void |accessdate=11 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130111181655/http://www.gamersgate.com/void |archivedate=January 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Market share==
As one of the earliest digital distribution services, GamersGate saw rapid expansion in its earlier years with over 100 percent in growth from launch through 2009.&lt;ref name=reid/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elliott, Phil. "[http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/the-gate-keeper The Gate Keeper]". ''Gamesindustry.biz''. 4 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporaneously, GamersGate's parent company, Paradox Interactive, saw digital distribution overtake retail sales. In January 2011, it reported that GamersGate digital downloads accounted for 70 percent of Paradox's total revenue, which had grown over 1000 percent since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Tito, Greg. "[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup Misc - The State of PC Games: Paradox's 2011 Lineup]" (cont. pp.[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup.2 2], [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup.3 3], [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup.4 4], [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup.5 5], [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup.6 6], [http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/video-games/editorials/misc/8599-The-State-of-PC-Games-Paradox-s-2011-Lineup.7 7]). ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. 27 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By July of the same year, Paradox reported that 90 percent of its sales were digital (through both Steam and GamersGate).&lt;ref&gt;Senior, Tom. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20130720173740/http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/07/06/paradox-sales-are-90-digital-we-don%E2%80%99t-really-need-retailers-any-more-says-ceo Paradox sales are 90% digital, “we don’t really need retailers any more” says CEO]". ''[[PC Gamer]]''. 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total market share of digital downloads going to GamersGate, however, is considerably smaller than its major competitor, Steam. It has also faced competition from newer companies like [[GOG.com]] and from contemporaries like [[Impulse (software)|Impulse]] and [[Direct2Drive]].&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Owen.

Stardock's claim that Impulse controlled 10 percent of the market was vocally disputed by both Direct2Drive and GamersGate, with GamersGate's Theo Bergquist arguing that "in many, many cases we know that GamersGate sell as many units as Steam for the mid-size segment of titles."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Alice.

===Competition with other distributors===
GamersGate has been in active competition with digital distributors including Steam, Impulse, Direct2Drive, and to a lesser extent OnLive, and Origin. Notably, GamersGate has gained a reputation for sharp criticism of Steam&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Brenna. "[http://www.vg247.com/2011/12/20/gamersgate-ceo-dismisses-onlive-origin-and-steam GamersGate CEO dismisses OnLive, Origin and Steam]". ''[[VG247]]''. 20 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; which in 2011 Theo Bergquist suggested was "peaking".&lt;ref&gt;Hillier, Brenna.

''[[VG247]]''. 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Although market statistics convincingly show Steam to be the most dominant player in the digital distribution market, Bergquist argues that this is strictly due to the fact that the market is currently oriented toward the [[hardcore gamers|hardcore gamer]] subculture.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Dan.

''[[Gamasutra]]''. 9 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergquist predicts that Steam will lose market share as the market widens in the future and that GamersGate, with its considerably less cumbersome client-free and DRM-free system, is well positioned to grow rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Chalk, Andy.

''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''. 8 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreement over Steam's embracing of DRM technologies has led GamersGate and others to boycott the distribution of popular titles like ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' that contain software such as IWNET, a player matchmaking service that works through Steam and therefore requires a Steam client and account.&lt;ref&gt;Purchese, Robert.

GamersGate's criticism of Impulse has also received extensive coverage in the gaming press. As early as 2009, GamersGate criticized Impulse owner Stardock's analysis of its share of the digital download market as misleadingly self-aggrandizing. A series of back and forth comments between the companies prompted ''Kotaku'''s Luke Plunkett to describe GamersGate, Impulse, and Direct2Drive as "guys jostling over the last spot on the podium".&lt;ref name=plunkett/&gt; Criticism was again levied by GamersGate against Impulse in April 2011 in response to GameStop's acquisition of Impulse from Stardock. GamersGate's Theo Bergquist questioned the wisdom of the purchase, describing Impulse as Steam's "lesser talented stepchild"&lt;ref&gt;Westbrook, Logan.

'''Ground Based Strategic Deterrent''' is a US land-based [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] system in the early stages of development, slated to replace all 450 [[Minuteman III]] missiles in service with the [[United States Air Force]] from 2027 onward. 

==History==
A request for proposal for development and maintenance of a Ground Based Strategic Deterrent next-generation nuclear ICBM, was made by the US Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, ICBM Systems Directorate, GBSD Division on 29 July 2016. The GBSD would replace the Minuteman III in the land based portion of the US Nuclear Triad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Boeing_Ready_to_Design_Next_Generation_of_US_Nuclear_Missiles_999.html|title=Boeing Ready to Design Next Generation of US Nuclear Missiles|author=|date=|website=spacedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new missile to be phased in over a decade from the late 2020s are estimated over a fifty-year life cycle to cost around $86 billion. Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman are competing for the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/US_Air_Force_set_to_replace_intercontinental_nuke_arsenal_999.html|title=US Air Force set to replace intercontinental nuke arsenal|author=|date=|website=spacedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 21 August 2017 the US Air Force awarded 3-year development contracts to Boeing and Northrop Grumman, for $349 million and $329 million, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Aaron Gregg ''Washington Post'' (21 August 2017) "Pentagon narrows competition for the next big U.S. nuclear missile" &lt;/ref&gt; One of these companies will be selected to produce this ground-based nuclear ICBM in 2020. In 2027 the GBSD program is expected to enter service and remain active until 2075.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Boeing_Northrop_Grumman_receive_development_contracts_for_new_ICBM_999.html|title=Boeing, Northrop Grumman receive development contracts for new ICBM|author=|date=|website=spacedaily.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Handkerchief.jpg|right|thumb|[[Linen]] handkerchief]]

A '''handkerchief''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|ŋ|k|ər|tʃ|ɪ|f}}; also called a '''hankie''' or, historically, a '''handkercher''') is a form of a [[kerchief]] or bandanna, typically a hemmed square of thin [[fabric]] or [[paper]] which can be carried in the [[pocket]] or [[handbag]], and which is intended for personal [[hygiene]] purposes such as wiping one's [[hand]]s or face, or [[nose-blowing|blowing one's nose]]. A handkerchief is also sometimes used as a purely decorative accessory in a suit pocket, it is then called a '''pocket square'''. It is also an important accessory in many folkdances in many regions like the [[Balkans]] and the [[Middle East]]; an example of a folkdance using handkerchiefs is [[Kalamatianos]].

==Modern usage==
The material of a handkerchief can be symbolic of the socioeconomic class of the user, not only because some materials are more expensive, but because some materials are more absorbent and practical for those who use a handkerchief for more than style.  Handkerchiefs can be made of [[cotton]], cotton-synthetic blend, synthetic fabric, [[silk]], or [[linen]].

Handkerchiefs are also used as an impromptu way to carry around small items when a bag or basket is unavailable. They could also serve as a substitute for a bandage over a small injury.  In the [[United Kingdom]], the habit of wearing a handkerchief with tied corners on one's head at the beach has become a [[Seaside postcard#British seaside postcards|seaside postcard]] stereotype.

Signals may also be sent by handkerchief, such as the American [[LGBT]] (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender) [[handkerchief code]]s. In [[Spanish football]] or in [[bullfighting]], it is a common sight to see supporters waving white handkerchiefs as an expression of deep emotion. It is used both positively, in admiration of an exceptional performance by a team or player, or as a negative sign of disgust at an especially bad performance.

From the late 18th century white handkerchiefs were waved, generally by women (men usually waved their hats), to demonstrate approval at public events such as processions or political rallies.&lt;ref&gt;"Mr. PITT's carriage was nearly the last...he was received with very general applause; the ladies waving their white handkerchiefs from the windows as he passed." "The Procession To St. Paul's." Times [London, England], 20 December 1797, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;General Lafayette was greeted on a visit to Providence, R.I., by "nearly 200 Misses, arrayed in white," who strewed flowers in his path  "at the same time waving their white handkerchiefs." "Lafayette In America." Times [London, England] 16 October 1824, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Using handkerchiefs to accentuate hand movements while dancing is a feature of both West African and African-American traditional dance, in the latter case especially in wedding celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;'Information About Dancing And Waving White Handkerchiefs In Ewe Cultures Of Ghana &amp; Togo And The Igbo Culture Of Nigeria' Edited by Azizi Powell [http://pancocojams.blogspot.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Handkerchiefs are also traditional [[accoutrements]] in certain kinds of English folk dance, such as the [[Morris dance]].

Besides their intended use, they could be used for cleaning equipment, polishing shoes, cleaning hands and face, signalling for attention, as a sweat band, neckerchief, as protection from dust inhalation, to repair footwear, cut out pieces to patch clothes, cut up as emergency firearms cleaning patches, Molotov cocktail wick (fire-bomb), hot cooking utensil holder, a makeshift bandage, tourniquet, or arm sling.

==Origin==
Before people used the word handkerchief, the word kerchief alone was common. This term came from two French words: couvrir, which means “to cover,” and chef, which means “head.”

In the times of ancient Greece and Rome, handkerchiefs were often used the way they are today.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} But in the Middle Ages, kerchiefs were usually used to cover the head.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Then in the 16th century, people in Europe began to carry kerchiefs in their pockets to wipe their forehead or their nose. To distinguish this kind of kerchief from the one used to cover the head, the word "hand" was added to "kerchief".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

King [[Richard II of England]], who reigned from 1377 to 1399, is widely believed to have invented the cloth handkerchief, as surviving documents written by his courtiers describe his use of square pieces of cloth to wipe his nose.&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]]. ''[[A Distant Mirror]]'', 473.&lt;/ref&gt; Certainly they were in existence by [[Shakespeare]]'s time, and a handkerchief is an important plot device in his play ''[[Othello]]''.

==Pocket square==
[[Image:Grey and navy suit on mannequin.jpg|thumb|[[Suit (clothing)|Suits]] with pocket handkerchief]]

In addition to carrying for practical purposes, handkerchiefs have long been displayed in the top pocket of men's jackets. Used in this way, they are referred to as a '''pocket handkerchief''' or '''pocket square'''. A traditional pocket square will have the hem rolled, contrary to handkerchiefs.

The trend of pocket squares as a fashion accessory really started during the 1920s, and continued until the 1960s. During that period, actors such as [[Cary Grant]], [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Gary Cooper]] wore them regularly. The pocket square subsequently fell into disuse until the late 2000s when it made a comeback thanks in part to popular television shows such as ''[[Mad Men]]''.

Pocket squares are usually made in fabrics such as silk, cotton, linen or wool.

As a visible fashion item there are a wide variety of ways to fold a pocket square, ranging from the austere to the flamboyant:
* The Presidential, or Flat Fold, perhaps the simplest, is folded at right angles to fit in the pocket.
* The Winged Puff, a simple and elegant fold.
* The Puff or the [[Gary Cooper|Cooper]] is simply shaped into a round puff.
* The Reverse Puff, or The Crown Fold, is like the Puff, except with the puff inside and the points out, like petals.
* The Westo Four Point fold, the quickest way to achieve a four-point fold effect.
* The TV Fold looks similar but is folded diagonally with the point inside the pocket.
* The One-point Fold is folded diagonally with the point showing.
* The Two-point Fold is folded off-center so the two points do not completely overlap.
* The Three-point Fold is first folded into a triangle, then the corners are folded up and across to make three points.
* The Four-point Fold is an off-center version of the Three-point Fold.
* The [[James Cagney|Cagney]] is basically a backwards version of the Four-point Fold.
* The [[Fred Astaire|Astaire]] is a puff with a point on either side.
* The Straight Shell is pleated and then folded over to give the appearance of nested shells.
* The Diagonal Shell is pleated diagonally and then folded.

'''Heterogeneous combustion''', otherwise known as '''combustion in porous media''', is a type of [[combustion]] in which a solid and gas phase interact to promote the complete transfer of reactants to their lower energy potential products. In this type of combustion a high surface area solid is immersed into a gaseous reacting flow, additional fluid phases may or may not be present. Chemical reactions and heat transfer occur locally on each phase and between both phases. Heterogeneous Combustion differs from [[catalysis]] as there is no focus to either phase individually but rather both examined simultaneously. In some materials, such as [[silicon carbide]] (SiC), oxide layers, SiO and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which form on the surface enable the adsorption of water vapor from the gas phase onto the solid lowering partial pressures.&lt;ref name=[1]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terracciano|first1=Anthony|title=Design and development of a porous heterogeneous combustor for efficient heat production by combustion of liquid and gaseous fuels|journal=Applied Energy|date=2016|volume=179|issue=1|pages=228–236|doi=10.1016/S0082-0784(81)80052-5|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0082078481800525}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this regime of combustion, thermal heat released from the combustion byproducts are transferred into the solid phase by [[convection]]; conduction and radiation both then conduct heat upstream (along with adverse convection within the gas phase). Heat is then convectively transferred to the unburnt reactants.&lt;ref name=[2]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Takeno|first1=Tadao|title=A theoretical study on an excess enthalpy flame|journal=Symposium (International) on Combustion|date=1981|volume=18|issue=1|pages=465–72|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.128|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261916309035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

Within the literature, there many applications of heterogeneous combustion which are derived from the unique manner in which this combustion process recirculates heat. These devices may be utilized as either stand alone devices, or in conjunction with other means of energy conversion for highly efficient [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) applications. For example, electricity production via both radiative and convective heat exchange with the combustion chamber can be accomplished using Organic Rankine Cycles in a multi step heating process,&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt; or using strictly radiative emissions via [[photovoltaic]] and [[thermionic]] generators.&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt; 
Heterogeneous combustors may be utilized for small-scale heating purposes,&lt;ref name=[3]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Babkin|first1=V|title=Seepage gas combustion|journal=Applied Energy|date=2010|volume=87|issue=7|pages=2148–2155|doi=10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.11.010|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261909004978}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as oxidizers of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs).&lt;ref name=[4]&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Avdic|first1=F|title=Seepage gas combustion|journal=Combustion, Explosion and Shock Waves|date=1987|volume=23|issue=5|pages=531–547|doi=10.1007/BF00756535|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00756535?LI=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterogeneous combustion may also be combined in series and parallel with multiple injection stages for use in gas flares at chemical manufacturing plants or oil wells.&lt;ref name=[1] /&gt;

==Flame structure==

[[File:Schematic of Heterogenous flame structure.png|thumb|left|A diagram for a simple heterogeneous combustor, showing the flame location in red which exists within voids of a solid structure.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;]]
[[File:Temperature Distribution of Heterogenous flame structure.png|thumb|A plot showing the temperature of gas and solid phases for heterogeneous combustion with the direction of heat transfer marked in red.&lt;ref name=[5] /&gt;]]

Within a combustion chamber containing porous media, structure of the environment can be assumed as follows. A preheating region exists prior to the surface of the flame front denoted by δ&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;. Preheating length is marked by the beginning of the porous solid where appreciable heat transfer to the gas phase occurs and ends when the solid and gas phase reach equilibrium temperature. The region of chemical heat release, the flame, whose thickness can be given as δ&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, exists following the preheat region and its length is dependent upon mass flux, surface properties, and equivalence ratio. Beyond the flame, where minimal chemical heat release occurs, heat is convectively transferred from the post combustion gasses into the solid. Heat then conducts and radiates through the solid structure upstream through the flame. Within the preheating region, heat is again convectively transferred from the solid structure to the gas.&lt;ref name=[5]&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Terracciano |first=Anthony Carmine |title=DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF HETEROGENEOUS COMBUSTION SYSTEMS FOR LEAN BURN APPLICATIONS |type=M.S.M.E |url=http://etd.fcla.edu/CF/CFE0005269/thesis_Final.pdf |year=2014 |publisher=University of Central Florida}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New weapons, however, such as Germany's giant cannons,  the "[[Paris Gun]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/parisgun.htm|title=Paris Gun|website=www.astronautix.com|access-date=2016-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105000000/http://www.astronautix.com/lvs/parisgun.htm|archivedate=2017-11-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;" (Encyclopedia Astronautica) and "[[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]]," and the [[V-2 rocket]], meant that projectiles would travel hundreds of miles in distance and dozens of miles in height, in all weathers. As a result, variables such as diminished wind resistance in thin atmospheres and changes in [[gravitational pull]] reduced accuracy using the historic methodology. There was the additional problem of planes that could now fly hundreds of miles an hour. Differential equations were applied to [[stochastic process]]es. Developing machines that could speed up human calculation of differential equations led in part to the creation of the modern computer through the efforts of [[Vannevar Bush]], [[John von Neumann]] and others.

According to Mary Croarken in her paper "Computing in Britain During World War II," by 1945, the Cambridge Mathematical Laboratory created by [[John Lennard-Jones]] utilized the latest computing devices to perform the equations. These devices included a model "[[differential analyser]]," and the [[Mallock machine]], described as "an electrical simultaneous equation solver." According to Croarken, the Ministry was also interested in the new arrival of a differential analyzer accommodating eight integrators. This exotic computing device built by Metropolitan-Vickers in 1939 consisted of wheel and disk mechanisms that could provide descriptions and solutions  for differential equations. Output resulted in a plotted graph.

At the same time, in the United States, [[analog computer]] pioneer Vannevar Bush took on a similar role to that of Lennard-Jones in the military effort after President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] entrusted him with the bulk of wartime research into automatic control of fire power using machines and computing devices.

According to Sarah Bergbreiter in her paper "Moving from Practice to Theory: Automatic Control after World War II," fire control for the downing of enemy aircraft by anti-aircraft guns was the priority. The analog electro-mechanical computing machines plotted the differential firing data while servos created by H.L. Hazen adapted the data to the guns for precise firing control and accuracy. Other improvements of a similar type by Bell Labs increased firing stability so that output from the differential engines could be fully used to compensate for stochastic behaviors of enemy aircraft and large guns. A new age of intelligent warfare had begun.

This work at [[MIT]] and Bell Labs would later lead to [[Norbert Wiener]]'s development of the electronic computer and the science of [[cybernetics]] for the same purpose, speeding the differential calculation process exponentially and taking one more giant step toward the creation of the modern digital computer using [[von Neumann architecture]]. Dr. von Neumann was one of the original mathematicians employed in the development of differential equations for ballistic warfare.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4441">'''Hydrogen purity''' or hydrogen quality is a term to describe the lack of impurities in [[hydrogen]] as a [[fuel gas]]. The purity requirement varies with the application, for example a H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Internal combustion engine|ICE]] can tolerate low hydrogen purity where a hydrogen fuel cell requires high hydrogen purity to prevent [[catalyst poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy07osti/41541.pdf 2007-DOE-Hydrogen Fuel Quality]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hydrogen purity requirements for fuel cells==
In the first generation of [[fuel cell]]s [[catalyst]]s like [[palladium]], [[ruthenium]] and [[platinum]] are used in combination with [[hydrogen production]] from hydrocarbons which results in performance degradation. 

The catalyst poisoning induced by some impurities like [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide,]] [[formic acid]], or [[formaldehyde]] can be reversed with a high purity hydrogen stream. Presence of other impurities like sulfurs may lead to permanent degradation of the fuel cells&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=X. Cheng, Z. Shi, N. Glass, L. Zhang, J. Zhang, D. Song, Z.-S. Liu, H. Wang and J. Shen|first=|date=|title=A review of PEM hydrogen fuel cell contamination:Impacts, mechanisms, and mitigation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378775306025304|journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=165|pages=739-756|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;.&lt;/sup&gt; The kind of impurities and their level depends on the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production process (e.g., steam methane reforming, electrolysis) but impurities can also be introduced due to transport, cleaning of the refueling station, leakages or maintenance. 

In Europe, the Directive 2014/94/EU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0094&amp;from=EN|title=Directive 2014/94/EU on the deployment of alternative fuels structure|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure states that the hydrogen purity dispensed by hydrogen refuelling points shall comply with the technical specifications included in the ISO 14687-2 standard. ISO 14687-2 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/55083.html|title=ISO 14687-2:2012|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifies maximum impurities levels for particles and several gaseous impurities. For many compounds the limit values are very low including total sulfur (4 nmol/mol) or carbon monoxide (200 nmol/mol). The least stringent limits are for helium (300 µmol/mol) and total nitrogen/argon (300 µmol/mol).  The sum of the impurities should be less than 300 µmol/mol (e.g. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purity is 99.97%). 

== Analytical methods for hydrogen purity analysis ==
As the limit values for many impurities are very low this sets stringent demands on the sensitivity of the analytical methods. Moreover, the high reactivity of some impurities requires use of a properly passivated sampling and analytical systems. A combination of different instruments (e.g. gas chromatography, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy) is now needed to cover all components listed in ISO 14687-2. Currently, several research efforts are directed to address the existing problems focusing on new multi-component analytical methods, risk assessments to limit the number of impurities to be analyzed (e.g. by using information from the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production process) and lay the metrological foundation for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; purity analysis (&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.lne.eu/jrp-hydrogen/|title=EMPIR hydrogen project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hycora.eu/workshops/09102015/Aarhaug_WP2.pdf|title=Hycora workshop|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319918308450|title=Risk assesment impurities ISO 14687-2|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

An '''integrated route network''' is one that allows the traveller to experience a safe, convenient, and comfortable trip door-to-door.&lt;ref&gt;Fang, Ke; Zimmerman, Samuel L.. 2015. Public transport service optimization and system integration. China transport topics; no. 14. Washington, DC: World Bank Group. [http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/322961468019179668/Public-transport-service-optimization-and-system-integration]&lt;/ref&gt; Segments of journeys are continuous in space, services are scheduled to minimize waiting times, and ticketing or other administrative tasks are reduced to the minimum.&lt;ref&gt;What is successful transport integration? Professor Phil Charles. Transport Futures Institute. February 22, 2014. http://www.transport-futures.com/what-is-successful-transport-integration/ accessed 6/11/2017&lt;/ref&gt; The concept may be applied to single transport modes or to combinations. Key elements include coordinated planning, continuous [[infrastructure]], carefully-timed operations, and information to users. 

==Planning==

In order to achieve an integrated network including different [[modes of transport]], all agencies responsible for the various modes must work effectively together. If they are fragmented, and especially if they are in direct competition with each other, effective joint working is unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Transport Committee. Evidence. pp. 149-155. Reg Harman. Integrated Transport: The future of light rail and modern trams in Britain. https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cVfnWO9pC8oC&amp;pg=PA150&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traveller information==
Prospective travellers must be able to access information about their possible journey. For public transport services, travellers should be able to access real-time information on services, or should (in high-use areas) be confident that the next service will arrive very shortly.

'''Krakatoa''' is a modular explosive device used for [[explosive ordnance disposal]] (EOD) or demolitions developed by the British company [[Sidney Alford|Alford Technologies]]. The device is designed to fire a number of different projectiles, operates both in air and underwater, and can be used in a vertical or horizontal orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jeod/jeoda044.html |title=Krakatoa{RT} large point-focal, explosively formed projectile shaped charge kit |accessdate=2008-10-13 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2008-03-10 |work=Jane's Explosive Ordnance Disposal |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |location= |pages= |language= |doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412165224/http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jeod/jeoda044.html |archivedate=April 12, 2009 |quote= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The device was featured during the second season of [[Discovery Channel]]'s television series ''[[Future Weapons]]'', in which it was shown penetrating an inch of steel plate at 25 yards. The device's casing is made of plastic which is packed with plastique  ([[C-4 (explosive)|C4]]) and capped with an inverted copper cone.

The device itself is "no bigger than a standard can of coke."

It is named after the famous [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa]], which resulted in the loudest sound ever heard and was the second [[List of volcanic eruptions by death toll|deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history]].

== Uses ==
This explosive device was designed to play a role in covert operations, as a small but extremely powerful device that can disable tanks, vehicles, or even a warship. The device can be used underwater, at high altitudes, and in snow, hail, sleet, or any form of weather.

The device has copper cone with a driving charge of very fast high explosive behind it.  The metal cone is the difference between a regular C4 'slappack' or hollow charge and a HEAT device.

When detonated, the copper cone is inverted into a narrow stream of copper and fired at extremely high velocity at the target, this can pierce certain thicknesses of steel armor or concrete.

== Characteristics and use ==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Krakatoa_Shaped_Charge_System_-_by_Alford_Technologies_Ltd.jpg|thumb|right|The Krakatoa Shaped Charge System by Alford Technologies Ltd.]] --&gt;
The weapon looks like a small circular tube, no wider than a tea-cup plate and no taller than a soft-drink can. On one end, it is covered with plastic, but the other end houses the copper cone. Inside the actual device is C4, and this is used to form the copper into an [[explosively formed penetrator]] and turn it into a weapon. So far unused in war, it is tested standing on a small pair of bipod legs, and the copper cone is faced toward the target. There is a 'stand off distance' to allow correct formation of the penetrator stream. This is the reason for its legs.

For a special ops team, the weapon will already have the C4 placed inside, about two pounds of it, and being a versatile explosive, the weapon will not set off in any condition. One uses it by placing it on the stand, moving far away from it and then pressing the detonator. The whole weapon itself explodes, so it is not a handheld weapon or a device to stand near when operating or firing.

An '''LCR meter''' is a type of [[electronic test equipment]] used to measure the [[inductance]] (L), [[capacitance]] (C), and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (R) of an [[electrical component| electronic component]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ietlabs.com/lcr-meter-informational-guide&lt;/ref&gt;. In the simpler versions of this instrument the [[electrical impedance|impedance]] was measured internally and converted for display to the corresponding capacitance or inductance value. 
Readings should be reasonably accurate if the capacitor or inductor device under test does not have a significant resistive component of impedance. More advanced designs measure true inductance or capacitance, as well as the [[equivalent series resistance]] of capacitors and the [[Q factor]] of inductive components.

==Operation==
Usually the [[device under test]] (DUT) is subjected to an [[alternating current|AC]] [[voltage source]]. The meter measures the [[voltage]] across and the [[electrical current|current]] through the DUT. From the ratio of these the meter can determine the magnitude of the impedance. The [[phase angle]] between the voltage and current is also measured in more advanced instruments; in combination with the impedance, the equivalent capacitance or inductance, and resistance, of the DUT can be calculated and displayed. The meter must assume either a parallel or a series model for these two elements. An ideal capacitor has no characteristics other than capacitance, but there are no physical ideal capacitors.  All real capacitors have a little inductance, a little resistance, and some defects causing inefficiency.  These can be seen as inductance or resistance in series with the ideal capacitor or in parallel with it.  And so likewise with inductors.  Even resistors can have inductance (especially if they are wire wound types) and capacitance as a consequence of the way they are constructed. The most useful assumption, and the one usually adopted, is that LR measurements have the elements in series (as is necessarily the case in an inductor's  coil) and that CR measurements have the elements in parallel (as is necessarily the case between a capacitor's 'plates').  Leakage is a special case in capacitors, as the leakage is necessarily across the capacitor plates, that is, in series. 

An LCR meter can also be used to measure the inductance variation with respect to the rotor position in permanent magnet machines. (However, care must be taken, as some LCR meters will be damaged by the generated EMF produced by turning the rotor of a permanent-magnet motor;  in particular those intended for electronic component measurements.)

Handheld LCR meters typically have selectable test frequencies of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz, 120&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1&amp;nbsp;kHz, 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, and 100&amp;nbsp;kHz for top end meters. The display resolution and measurement range capability will typically change with the applied test frequency since the circuitry is more sensitive or less for a given component (ie, an inductor or capacitor) as the test frequency changes.

Benchtop LCR meters sometimes have selectable test frequencies of more than 100&amp;nbsp;kHz. They often include options to superimpose a DC voltage or current on the AC measuring signal. Lower end meters might offer the possibility to externally supply these DC voltages or currents while higher end devices can supply them internally. In addition benchtop meters typically allow the usage of special fixtures (ie, Kelvin wiring, that is to say, 4-wire connections)  to measure SMD components, air-core coils or transformers.

==Bridge circuits==
[[File:P1010777 (5751552740) (2).jpg|thumb|[[General Radio]] model 716-C capacitance bridge.  This model was first made early 1940s and remained in production throughout the 1950s and 1960s.]]
Inductance, capacitance, resistance, and dissipation factor can also be measured by various [[bridge circuit]]s. They involve adjusting variable calibrated elements until the signal at a detector becomes null, rather than measuring impedance and phase angle.

Early commercial LCR bridges used a variety of techniques involving the matching or "nulling" of two signals derived from a single source.  The first signal was generated by applying the test signal to the unknown and the second signal was generated by using a combination of known-value R and C standards.  The signals were summed through a detector (normally a panel meter with or without some level of amplification).  When zero current was noted by changing the value of the standards and looking for a "null" in the panel meter, it could be assumed that the current magnitude through the unknown was equal to that of the standard and that the phase was exactly the reverse (180 degrees apart).  The combination of standards selected could be arranged to read out C and DF directly which was the precise value of the unknown.  An example of this is the [[GenRad]]/IET Labs Model 1620 and 1621 Capacitance Bridges.

'''Linens''' are fabric household goods intended for daily use, such as [[bedding]], [[tablecloth]]s and [[towel]]s. "Linens" may also refer to church linens, meaning the [[altar cloth]]s used in church.

==History==
[[File:Linen, Texture (2242358989).jpg|thumb|A close-up of the texture of hand-woven linen fabric made in the early 20th century in the [[Balkans]].]]
[[File:Fig. 41. Linen darning.jpg|thumb|An illustration of how to [[Darning|darn]] linen, from the ''Encyclopedia of Needlework'' (1884) by Thérèse de Dillmont.]]
[[File:Armoire avec linge de maison2.jpg|thumb|A French [[armoire]] with home linens arranged in a traditional manner, with [[Embroidery|embroidered]] dust covers over the shelves.]]
The earliest known household linens were made from thin yarn spun from [[flax]] fibres to make [[linen]] cloth. [[Ancient Egypt]], [[Babylon]], and [[Phoenicia]] all cultivated flax crops. The earliest surviving fragments of linen cloth have been found in Egyptian tombs and date to 4000 BCE. Flax fibres have been found in cloth fragments in Europe that date to the [[Neolithic]] prehistoric age.&lt;ref name=Sekhri&gt;{{cite book|last=Sekhri|first=Seema|title=Textbook of Fabric Science Fundamentals to Finishing|year=2011|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788120341838}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}}

[[Cotton]] is another popular fibre for making cloth used for household linens. Its use in cloth-making also dates back to prehistoric times, in [[Indian subcontinent]], [[China]], [[Peru]] and [[Egypt]]. The Indian subcontinent was especially well known for high quality cotton cloth as early as 1500 BCE.&lt;ref name=Sekhri/&gt;{{rp|66}}

Linen was an especially popular cloth during the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe, when cotton was an exotic import.  It was used for underclothing, [[chemise]]s, shifts, shirts and blouses, in fact most clothing worn next to the skin, by those able to afford an extra layer of clothing. The tradition of calling household fabric goods "linens" dates from this period,&lt;ref name=Sekhri/&gt;{{rp|76}} but meant clothing as much as large sheets.  According to medieval tradition, which survived up until the modern era, a bride would often be given a gift of linens made by the women in her family as a wedding present, to help her set up her new married home. In France this was called a [[wikt:trousseau|trousseau]], and was often presented to the bride in a wooden [[hope chest]].  

The [[Industrial Revolution]] brought huge changes to cloth manufacturing. The rise of European colonialism at the same time helped support the rapid growth of cloth production by creating many cheap sources of raw materials. British cloth manufacturers would import raw cotton from America  and the [[British West Indies]] to [[Ireland]], where it would be spun into yarn. The yarn would be imported into England, where mechanized factories employed thousands of workers, who would weave cloth on industrial looms. In 1781, a cloth producer from [[Manchester]] testified about his business to a committee of the House of Commons in the [[British Parliament]]. He stated that he employed 6000 workers, who would print and stamp 60,000 yards of cotton and linen fabric a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Debrett, J.|title=The Parliamentary register: or, History of the proceedings and debates of the House of Commons, Volume 3|year=1782|publisher=Google eBook, British House of Commons|location=Harvard University|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cotton gradually replaced linen for most uses in clothing, but remained preferred for bedsheets and tablecloths.  Other European countries manufactured and traded their own types of household linens as well, and mass manufacturing techniques and trade competition gradually made affordable household linens common.

Today, the term "linen" is still used for bedsheets, tablecloths and similar household textiles, even though most are made of cotton, synthetic fabrics, or blends.  Especially in [[American English]], they may be called "white goods", otherwise a term for kitchen [[major appliance]]s.

==Cleaning and storage of linens==
Cleaning household linens is done as appropriate to the type of cloth. Household linens are most likely to have stains from organic sources such as food, blood, and soil. If the linens are made of natural fibres such as linen or cotton, the cloth will need to be rinsed as soon as possible in cold water to prevent the stain from becoming permanent. Stains from red wine, or red or purple berries and fruit are an exception and must be washed in boiling water,&lt;ref name=Trontz&gt;{{cite book|last=Trontz|first=Jennifer McKnight|title=Home Economics: Vintage Advice and Practical Science for the 21st Century Household|year=2010|publisher=Quirk Books|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9781594744617}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|97}} yet despite this, these stains may be impossible to remove. Otherwise, regular washing of household linens should be done in hot water for [[hygiene|hygienic]] reasons, to destroy [[bacteria]] left on the linens from frequent use. Linen and cotton that are white may also become yellow over time, but this is eliminated by bleaching, either with liquid [[bleach]], or by the traditional method of hanging the linens in the sun to let the sunlight bleach out the discoloration.&lt;ref name=Trontz/&gt;{{rp|94}}

Household linens are stored near the area where they are used, when possible, for convenience. Otherwise, bed and kitchen and dining linens may be  stored together in a linen closet or cupboard. There are many methods of folding linens for storage. For formal occasions, table linens may be ironed before use. Traditionally, table linens could be [[Laundry starch|starched]] while ironing, to decrease wrinkling and retain a smooth, pristine appearance. Seasonal storage of linens led to the development of natural pest control methods in Europe to prevent [[moth]] [[larva]]e and other insects or rodents from eating the cloth. [[Sachet (scented bag)|Sachet]]s made of dried [[Margosa]] (neem), [[clove]]s, [[lavender]], and other herbs are traditional, as are [[cedar wood]] chips.&lt;ref name=DSouza&gt;{{cite book|last=D'Souza|first=Noemia|title=Fabric Care|year=1998|publisher=New Age International|isbn=9788122411430}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133}}

===Industrial cleaning of linens===
Industrial laundries were developed in the Middle Ages, when large convents and monasteries used their own facilities. Hospitals and boarding schools followed this example. Today, there are several types of industrial laundries. Hospitals often use laundry chutes to collect used linens. These are transported to an industrial laundry, where they are sorted into three categories: regularly soiled, infected, or staff uniforms. They are laundered as appropriate, usually at high temperatures, to ensure that viruses, bacteria, and soil are cleaned and that the linens are hygienic before being returned to the hospital.&lt;ref name=DSouza/&gt;{{rp|138}}

In India, [[Dhobi]] ghats provide laundry service to both institutions and households. Household linens and clothing are both collected on a fixed day of the week by the Dhobi, who washes the laundry at a ghat, which is often in a large Dhobi ghat zone where many Dhobis work at their own stall. Each stall is approximately four square metres. Laundry is washed in large tubs, rinsed, cleaned by beating on a stone made for the purpose, and then the linens are hung on lines to dry. Industrial linens are treated in steamers for several hours for hygienic reasons. Dhobis also iron linens.&lt;ref name=DSouza/&gt;{{rp|142}}

==Antique linens==
The collecting and restoring of antique linens can be complex, depending upon the condition of the cloth. Many old household linens were stored filled with starch, which damages the cloth over time since it hardens and causes wearing and tears in the fabric where it is folded and creased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Frances|title=Collecting antique linens, lace &amp; needlework|year=1991|publisher=Wallace-Homestead Book Co.|isbn=9780870696336|pages=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of an antique linen must determine if conserving, repairing, or mending are appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Colonial homes, Vol. 15|year=1989|publisher=Hearst Corp.|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of antique linens may be identified by the place where they were made. Some well-known locations for making heirloom-quality household linens include Ireland, for its [[Irish linen]] and lace, and [[Madeira]], known for a type of linen called [[Madeira cloth]]. The type of embellishment on the linens may make them collectable, especially [[embroidery]], including Victorian-era [[redwork]] and [[bluework]], which use only red or blue thread. Lace embellishments on linens also make them collectable, such as [[Battenberg lace]].

==White sale==
January "[[White sale]]s" have been a custom in the [[United States]] since the late 19th century. White sales are held by department stores to sell household linens, bedding and towels, at a price discount. The sales are called "White sales" since the sales started during an era when these items were only available in white.

==Addendum angle==
'''Addendum angle''' in  a bevel gear, is the angle between face cone and pitch cone.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Addendum circle==
[[Image:Internal diameters.JPG|thumb|150px|Internal gear diameters]]
[[Image:Root circle.JPG|thumb|150px|Root circle]]

The '''addendum circle''' coincides with the tops of the teeth of a gear and is concentric with the standard (reference) [[pitch circle]] and radially distant from it by the amount of the [[addendum#In engineering|addendum]].  For [[external gear]]s, the addendum circle lies on the outside cylinder while on [[internal gear]]s the addendum circle lies on the internal cylinder.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

'''Apex to back''', in a bevel gear or hypoid gear, is the distance in the direction of the axis from the apex of the pitch cone to a locating surface at the back of the blank.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Back angle==
The '''back angle''' of a bevel gear is the angle between an element of the back cone and a [[plane of rotation]], and usually is equal to the pitch angle.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Back cone==
[[Image:Conical surfaces.jpg|thumb|150px|Principal dimensions]]

The '''back cone''' of a bevel or hypoid gear is an imaginary cone tangent to the outer ends of the teeth, with its elements perpendicular to those of the pitch cone.  The surface of the gear blank at the outer ends of the teeth is customarily formed to such a back cone.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Back cone distance==
'''Back cone distance''' in a bevel gear is the distance along an element of the back cone from its apex to the pitch cone.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Backlash==
{{main article|Backlash (engineering)}}
In [[mechanical engineering]], backlash is the striking back of connected wheels in a piece of mechanism when pressure is applied. Another source defines it as the maximum distance through which one part of something can be moved without moving a connected part. It is also called lash or play. In the context of [[gears]], backlash is clearance between mating components, or the amount of lost motion due to clearance or slackness when movement is reversed and contact is re-established. In a pair of gears, backlash is the amount of clearance between mated gear teeth.

Backlash is unavoidable for nearly all reversing mechanical couplings, although its effects can be negated. Depending on the application it may or may not be desirable. Reasons for requiring backlash include allowing for [[lubrication]] and [[thermal expansion]], and to prevent jamming. Backlash may also result from manufacturing errors and [[Deflection (engineering)|deflection]] under load.

==Base circle==
{{section-links|zh=齿轮基圆}}
[[Image:Involute teeth.jpg|thumb|150px|Involute teeth]]

The '''base circle''' of an [[#Involute gear|involute gear]] is the circle from which [[#Involute teeth|involute tooth]] profiles are derived.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Base cylinder==

==Bevel gear==
{{main article|Bevel gear}}

==Bull gear==
The term '''bull gear''' is used to refer to the larger of two [[spur gear]]s that are in engagement in any machine.  The smaller gear is usually referred to as a [[pinion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bullgearinc.com/9.html |title=Bull Gear, Inc. - What is a Bull Gear!? |author=Tony Casey, President Bull Gear, Inc.  |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Center distance==
[[File:Center distance.svg|thumb|150px|Center distance]]

'''Center distance''' (operating) is the shortest distance between non-intersecting axes.  It is measured along the mutual perpendicular to the axes, called the line of centers.  It applies to spur gears, parallel axis or crossed axis helical gears, and worm gearing.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Central plane==
[[Image:Central plane.svg|thumb|150px|Central plane]]

The '''central plane''' of a worm gear is perpendicular to the gear axis and contains the common perpendicular of the gear and worm axes.  In the usual case with axes at right angles, it contains the worm axis.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Composite action test==
[[File:Composite action.svg|thumb|Schematic of the composite action test]]

The '''composite action test''' (double flank) is a method of inspection in which the work gear is rolled in tight double flank contact with a master gear or a specified gear, in order to determine (radial) composite variations (deviations).  The composite action test must be made on a variable center distance composite action test device.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;
and this is composite action test for double flank
{{clear}}

==Cone distance==
[[File:Cone distance.svg|thumb|Cone distance]]

'''Cone distance''' in a bevel gear is the general term for the distance along an element of the pitch cone from the apex to any given position in the teeth.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

Outer cone distance in bevel gears is the distance from the apex of the pitch cone to the outer ends of the teeth. When not otherwise specified, the short term cone distance is understood to be outer cone distance.

Mean cone distance in bevel gears is the distance from the apex of the pitch cone to the middle of the [[#Face width|face width]].

Inner cone distance in bevel gears is the distance from the apex of the pitch cone to the inner ends of the teeth.

{{clear}}

==Conjugate gears==
'''Conjugate gears''' transmit uniform rotary motion from one shaft to another by means of [[gear]] teeth.  The normals to the profiles of these teeth, at all points of contact, must pass through a fixed point in the common centerline of the two shafts.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt; Usually conjugate gear tooth is made to suit the profile of other gear which is not made based on standard practice.

{{clear}}

==Crossed helical gear==
A '''crossed helical gear''' is a gear that operate on non-intersecting, non-parallel axes.

The term crossed helical gears has superseded the term ''spiral gears''.  There is theoretically point contact between the teeth at any instant.  They have teeth of the same or different helix angles, of the same or opposite hand.  A combination of spur and helical or other types can operate on crossed axes.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Crossing point==
The '''crossing point''' is the point of intersection of bevel gear axes; also the apparent point of intersection of the axes in hypoid gears, crossed helical gears, worm gears, and offset face gears, when projected to a plane parallel to both axes.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Crown circle==
The '''crown circle''' in a bevel or hypoid gear is the circle of intersection of the back cone and face cone.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Crowned teeth==
[[Image:Crowned gear.jpg|thumb|Crowned gear]]

'''Crowned teeth''' have surfaces modified in the lengthwise direction to produce localized contact or to prevent contact at their ends.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;
{{clear}}

==Dedendum angle==
'''Dedendum angle''' in a bevel gear, is the angle between elements of the root cone and pitch cone.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Equivalent pitch radius==
[[Image:Pitch radius.JPG|thumb|right|Back cone equivalent]]

'''Equivalent pitch radius''' is the radius of the pitch circle in a cross section of gear teeth in any plane other than a plane of rotation.  It is properly the radius of curvature of the pitch surface in the given cross section.  Examples of such sections are the transverse section of bevel gear teeth and the normal section of helical teeth.

{{clear}}

==Face (tip) angle==
'''Face (tip) angle''' in a bevel or hypoid gear, is the angle between an element of the face cone and its axis.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Face cone==
The '''face cone''', also known as the '''tip cone''' is the imaginary surface that coincides with the tops of the teeth of a bevel or hypoid gear.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Face gear==
[[Image:Face Worm Gear.jpg|thumb|Face worm gear]]

A '''face gear''' set typically consists of a disk-shaped gear, grooved on at least one face, in combination with a spur, helical, or conical [[pinion]]. A face gear has a planar pitch surface and a planar root surface, both of which are perpendicular to the axis of rotation.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt; It can also be referred to as a '''face wheel''', '''crown gear''', '''crown wheel''', '''contrate gear''' or '''contrate wheel'''.

{{clear}}

==Face width==
[[Image:Face width.jpg|thumb|Face width]]

The '''face width''' of a gear is the length of teeth in an axial plane.  For double helical, it does not include the gap.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

Total face width is the actual dimension of a gear blank including the portion that exceeds the effective face width, or as in double helical gears where the total face width includes any distance or gap separating right hand and left hand helices.

For a cylindrical gear, effective face width is the portion that contacts the mating teeth.  One member of a pair of gears may engage only a portion of its mate.

For a [[bevel gear]], different definitions for effective face width are applicable.

{{clear}}

==Form diameter==
[[Image:Form diameter.jpg|thumb|150px|Form diameter]]

'''Form diameter''' is the diameter of a circle at which the trochoid (fillet curve) produced by the tooling intersects, or joins, the involute or specified profile.  Although these terms are not preferred, it is also known as the true involute form diameter (TIF), start of involute diameter (SOI), or when undercut exists, as the undercut diameter.  This diameter cannot be less than the base circle diameter.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Front angle==
The '''front angle''', in a [[bevel gear]], denotes the angle between an element of the front cone and a plane of rotation, and usually equals the pitch angle.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Front cone==
The '''front cone''' of a hypoid or [[bevel gear]] is an imaginary cone tangent to the inner ends of the teeth, with its elements perpendicular to those of the pitch cone.  The surface of the gear blank at the inner ends of the teeth is customarily formed to such a front cone, but sometimes may be a plane on a pinion or a cylinder in a nearly flat gear.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Gear center==
A '''gear center''' is the center of the pitch circle.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Gear range==
The '''gear range''' is difference between the highest and lowest gear ratios and may be expressed as a percentage (e.g., 500%) or as a ratio (e.g., 5:1).

==Heel==
[[Image:Heel toe.jpg|thumb|Heel and toe]]

The '''heel''' of a tooth on a bevel gear or pinion is the portion of the tooth surface near its outer end.

The '''toe''' of a tooth on a bevel gear or pinion is the portion of the tooth surface near its inner end.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Helical rack==

==Index deviation==
The displacement of any tooth flank from its theoretical position, relative to a datum tooth flank.

Distinction is made as to the direction and algebraic sign of this reading.  A condition wherein the actual tooth flank position was nearer to the datum tooth flank, in the specified measuring path direction (clockwise or counterclockwise), than the theoretical position would be considered a minus (-) deviation.  A condition wherein the actual tooth flank position was farther from the datum tooth flank, in the specified measuring path direction, than the theoretical position would be considered a plus (+) deviation.

The direction of tolerancing for index deviation along the arc of the tolerance diameter circle within the transverse plane.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Standard pitch circle==
The '''standard pitch circle''' is the circle which intersects the involute at the point where the pressure angle is equal to the profile angle of the basic rack.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Standard pitch diameter==
The '''standard reference pitch diameter''' is the diameter of the standard pitch circle.  In spur and helical gears, unless otherwise specified, the standard pitch diameter is related to the number of teeth and the standard transverse pitch. The diameter can be roughly estimated by taking the average of the diameter measuring the tips of the gear teeth and the base of the gear teeth.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

The pitch diameter is useful in determining the spacing between gear centers because proper spacing of gears implies tangent pitch circles. The pitch diameters of two gears may be used to calculate the gear ratio in the same way the number of teeth is used.

:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{N}{P_d} = \frac{pN}{\pi} \qquad \text{spur gears}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; d = \frac{N}{P_{nd}\cos \psi } \qquad \text{helical gears}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the total number of teeth, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the circular pitch, &lt;math&gt;P_d&lt;/math&gt; is the diametrical pitch, and &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is the helix angle for helical gears.

==Standard reference pitch diameter==
The '''standard reference pitch diameter''' is the diameter of the standard pitch circle.  In spur and helical gears, unless otherwise specified, the standard pitch diameter is related to the number of teeth and the standard transverse pitch.  It is obtained as:&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; d = km = \frac{zp}{\pi} = z\frac{m_n}{\cos\beta } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{N}{P_d} = \frac{Np}{\pi}= \frac{N}{P_{nd} \cos\psi} &lt;/math&gt;

==Test radius==
The '''test radius''' ('''R&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;''') is a number used as an arithmetic convention established to simplify the determination of the proper test distance between a master and a work gear for a composite action test.  It is used as a measure of the effective size of a gear.  The test radius of the master, plus the test radius of the work gear is the set up center distance on a composite action test device.  Test radius is not the same as the operating pitch radii of two tightly meshing gears unless both are perfect and to basic or standard tooth thickness.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Throat diameter==
[[Image:Wormgear diameters.JPG|thumb|150px|Wormgear diameters]]

The '''throat diameter''' is the diameter of the addendum circle at the central plane of a wormgear or of a double-enveloping wormgear.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

{{clear}}

==Throat form radius==
'''Throat form radius''' is the radius of the throat of an enveloping wormgear or of a double-enveloping worm, in an axial plane.&lt;ref name="agma" /&gt;

==Tip radius==
[[Image:Tip radius.jpg|thumb|150px|Tip radius]]

'''Tip radius''' is the radius of the circular arc used to join a side-cutting edge and an end-cutting edge in gear cutting tools.  Edge radius is an alternate term.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Tip relief==
[[Image:Tip relief.jpg|thumb|150px|Tip relief]]

'''Tip relief''' is a modification of a tooth profile whereby a small amount of material is removed near the tip of the gear tooth.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

==Tooth surface==
[[Image:Tooth surface.jpg|thumb|Profile of a spur gear]]
[[Image:External numbering.jpg|left|thumb|Notation and numbering for an external gear]]
[[Image:Internal numbering.jpg|thumb|center|Notation and numbering for an internal gear]]

The '''tooth surface''' (flank) forms the side of a gear tooth.&lt;ref name="agma"/&gt;

It is convenient to choose one face of the gear as the reference face and to mark it with the letter “I”.  The other non-reference face might be termed face “II”.

For an observer looking at the reference face, so that the tooth is seen with its tip uppermost, the right flank is on the right and the left flank is on the left. Right and left flanks are denoted by the letters “R” and “L” respectively.

After their rejection, the founders of Apigy, Cameron Robertson and Paul Gerhardt, built their own crowdfunding website in a matter of days and used it to garner over 1.5 million USD in preorders during the first week of their campaign in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/49302775|title=Lockitron: How a Startup Overcame Kickstarter's Rejection|first=Erin Horan|last=CNBC.com|date=8 October 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apigy subsequently open-sourced their crowdfunding software as [[Selfstarter]], an alternative crowdfunding site.&lt;ref name="techcrunch20121007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/design/2012/12/kickstarter-rejects/|title=Rejected Kickstarter Projects Build Their Own Success Stories|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/lockitron/selfstarter|title=lockitron/selfstarter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selfstarter was used in the successful [[Tile (software)|Tile]] crowdfunding campaign and later formed the basis of Crowdhoster and CrowdTilt Open.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.tilt.com/updating-crowdhoster-building-accessible-open-source/|title=Updating Crowdhoster: Building Accessible, Open-Source Crowdfunding|date=2013-05-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Crowdtilt/CrowdtiltOpen|title=Crowdtilt/CrowdtiltOpen|website=GitHub|access-date=2016-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crowdfunded Lockitron was significantly delayed from its originally anticipated ship date of July 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.lockitron.com/post/51665008951/lockitron-has-a-ship-date|title=Lockitron has a Ship Date|website=Lockitron Blog|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; shipping in small numbers through the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.lockitron.com/post/57846644957/shipping-update|title=Shipping Update|website=Lockitron Blog|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By February 2014, the crowdfunded Lockitron had still not yet shipped in substantial numbers prompting coverage by the blog TechCrunch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/01/16/lockitrons-long-march/|title=Lockitron Still Hasn’t Shipped To Most Backers Over A Year After Its $2.2M Crowdfunding Effort|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2014 thousands of units had been shipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.lockitron.com/post/97765021837/shipment-updates-ios-app-release-and-upcoming-bug|title=Shipment Updates, iOS App Release and Upcoming Bug Fixes|website=Lockitron Blog|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Apigy announced its new product, Lockitron Bolt, as a replacement for the crowdfunded Lockitron and that it had ceased production of the crowdfunded Lockitron due to manufacturing and product issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7920963/lockitron-bolt-door-lock|title=A crowdfunded startup explains why crowdfunding can be a complete disaster|last=Popper|first=Ben|date=2015-01-27|website=The Verge|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lockitron Bolt==
Lockitron Bolt is priced at 99 USD and offers Bluetooth only connectivity in comparison to its predecessor which was priced at 179 USD and offered built-in WiFi; an optional 79 USD device called Bridge connects Lockitron Bolt to WiFi networks giving it the same remote capabilities as the 2012 Lockitron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/so-long-lockitron-version-1-0-hello-lockitron-bolt/|title=So long, Lockitron version 1.0, hello Lockitron Bolt|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/27/lockitron-announces-the-99-bolt-a-deadbolt-you-can-unlock-with-your-phone/|title=Lockitron Announces The $99 Bolt, A Deadbolt You Can Unlock With Your Phone|last=Russell|first=Kyle|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2015/01/27/lockitron-revamps-its-smartlock-with-a-price-cut-and-new-design/|title=Lockitron revamps its smart lock with a price cut and new design|last=Higginbotham|first=Stacey|date=2015-01-27|website=gigaom.com|access-date=2016-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Low technology''', often abbreviated '''low tech''' (adjective forms '''low-technology''', '''low-tech''', '''lo-tech''') is simple technology, often of a traditional or non-mechanical kind, such as [[crafts]] and [[tool]]s that pre-date the [[Industrial Revolution]]. It is the opposite of [[high technology]].

Low technology can typically be practised or fabricated with a minimum of [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment by an individual or small group of individuals. Also, the knowledge of the practice can be completely comprehended by a single individual, free from increasing [[Departmentalization|specialization]] and [[wikt:compartmentalization|compartmentalization]]. Low-tech techniques and designs may fall into disuse due to changing socio-economic conditions or priorities.

==Examples of low technology==

'''Note:''' almost all of the entries in this section should be prefixed by the word ''traditional''.

* [[weaving]] produced on non-automated looms, and [[basketry]].
* hand [[wood-working]], [[joiner]]y, [[coopering]], and [[carpentry]].
* the trade of the [[shipwright|ship-wright]].
* the trade of the [[Wheelwright|wheel-wright]].
* the trade of the [[wainwright]]: making wagons. (the Latin word for a two-wheeled ''wagon'' is ''carpentum'', the maker of which was a ''carpenter''.)

(''Wright'' is the [[agent form]] of the word ''wrought'', which itself is the original [[past passive participle]] of the word ''work'', now superseded by the [[Light verb|weak verb]] forms ''worker'' and ''worked'' respectively.)

* [[blacksmithing]] and the various related [[smithing]] and metal-crafts.
* [[folk music]] played on [[acoustic instruments]].
* [[mathematics]] (particularly, ''[[pure mathematics]]'')
* [[organic farming]] and [[animal husbandry]] (i.e.; agriculture as practiced by all American farmers prior to World War II).
* [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] in the sense of operating hand-constructed equipment with the intent to either grind grain, or the reduction of timber to lumber as practiced in a [[saw-mill]].
* [[fulling]], [[felt]]ing, [[spindle (textiles)|drop spindle]] spinning, [[hand knitting]], [[crochet]], &amp; similar textile preparation.
* the production of [[charcoal]] by the [[Charcoal maker|collier]], for use in [[home heating]], [[foundry]] operations, [[smelting]], the various [[smithing]] trades, and for brushing ones teeth as in [[Colonial America]].
* [[glass-blowing]].
* various subskills of [[food preservation]]:
** [[Smoking (food)|smoking]]
** [[salting (food)|salting]]
** [[pickling]]
** [[drying (food)|drying]]

'''Note''': [[home canning]] is a counter example of a '''low technology''' since some of the supplies needed to pursue this skill rely on a [[global trade network]] and an existing manufacturing [[infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

* the production of various [[alcoholic beverage]]s:
** [[wine]]: poorly preserved fruit juice.
** [[beer]]: a way to preserve the calories of grain products from decay.
** [[whiskey]]: an improved ([[distilled]]) form of beer.
* [[flint-knapping]]
* [[masonry]] as used in [[castles]], [[cathedrals]], and [[root cellar]]s.

==Legal status of low-technology==
{{See also|Handicraft|Organic food|Natural foods}}
By federal law in the United States, only those articles produced with little or no use of machinery or tools with complex mechanisms may be stamped with the designation "hand-wrought" or "hand-made". Lengthy court-battles are currently underway over the precise definition of the terms "organic" and "natural" as applied to [[foodstuff]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Groups associated with low-technology==
* [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], popularized by [[Gustav Stickley]] in America around 1900.
* [[Bauhaus]] movement of Germany around the same time.
* [[Do-It-Yourself]] phenomenon arising in America following [[World War II]].
* [[Back-to-the-land movement]] beginning in America during the 1960s.
* [[Luddites]], whose activities date to the very beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]].
* Living history and [[open-air museum]]s around the world, which strive to recreate bygone societies.
* [[Simple living]] adherents, such as the [[Amish]] and to a lesser extent some sects of the [[Mennonites]], who specifically refuse some newer technologies to avoid undesirable effects on themselves or their societies.
* [[Survivalists]] are often proponents,{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} since low-technology is inherently more [[:wikt:robust|robust]] than its [[high-technology]] counterpart.

A '''motion detector''' is a device that detects moving objects, particularly people. Such a device is often integrated as a component of a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. They form a vital component of security, [[Lighting control system|automated lighting control]], home control, energy efficiency and other useful systems.

==Overview==
[[File:All about motion detector.JPG|250px|thumb|Low-cost motion detector used to control lighting.]]
An electronic motion detector contains an optical, microwave, or acoustic sensor, and in many cases a transmitter for illumination. However, a ''passive'' sensor senses a signature only from the moving object via emission or reflection, i.e., it can be emitted by the object, or by some ambient emitter such as the sun or a radio station of sufficient strength. Changes in the optical, microwave, or acoustic field in the device's proximity are interpreted by the electronics based on one of the technologies listed below. Most low-cost motion detectors can detect up to distances of at least {{convert|15|ft|m}}. Specialized systems cost more, but have much longer ranges. Tomographic motion detection systems can cover much larger areas because the radio waves are at frequencies which penetrate most walls and obstructions, and are detected in multiple locations, not only at the location of the transmitter.

Motion detectors have found wide use in domestic and commercial applications. One common application is activating automatic door openers in businesses and public buildings. Motion sensors are also widely used in lieu of a true [[occupancy sensor]] in activating street lights or indoor lights in walkways, such as lobbies and staircases. In such ''[[smart lighting]]'' systems, energy is conserved by only powering the lights for the duration of a timer, after which the person has presumably left the area. A motion detector may be among the sensors of a [[burglar alarm]] that is used to alert the home owner or security service when it detects the motion of a possible intruder. Such a detector may also trigger a [[security camera]] to record the possible intrusion.

==Sensor technology{{anchor|Technology}}==
{{see also|Motion detection#Methods}}
[[File:Photospirp.jpg|200px|thumb|A passive infrared detector mounted on circuit board (right), along with photoresistive detector for visible light (left). This is the type most commonly encountered in household motion sensing devices and is designed to turn on a light only when motion is detected ''and'' when the surrounding environment is sufficiently dark.]]
Several types of motion detection are in wide use:
;Passive infrared (PIR): [[Passive infrared sensors|Passive infrared (PIR) sensors]] are sensitive to a person's skin temperature through emitted [[black body radiation]] at [[Infrared#ISO 20473 scheme|mid-infrared]] wavelengths, in contrast to background objects at room temperature. No energy is emitted from the sensor, thus the name ''passive infrared''. This distinguishes it from the [[electric eye]] for instance (not usually considered a ''motion detector''), in which the crossing of a person or vehicle interrupts a visible or infrared beam.
;Microwave: These detect motion through the principle of [[Doppler radar]], and are similar to a [[radar speed gun]]. A [[continuous wave]] of [[microwave]] radiation is emitted, and phase shifts in the reflected microwaves due to motion of an object toward (or away from) the receiver result in a [[heterodyne]] signal at a low [[audio frequency]].
;Ultrasonic: An [[ultrasonic transducer]] emits an [[ultrasonic wave]] (sound at a frequency higher than a human ear can hear) and receivers reflections from nearby objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-ultrasonic-motion-detector.htm |title=What Is an Ultrasonic Motion Detector? (with picture) |publisher=Wisegeek.com |date=2016-01-19 |accessdate=2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly as in [[Doppler radar]], heterodyne detection of the received field indicates motion. The detected [[doppler shift]] is also at low audio frequencies (for walking speeds) since the ultrasonic [[wavelength]] of around a centimeter is similar to the wavelengths used in microwave motion detectors. One potential drawback of ultrasonic sensors is that the sensor can be sensitive to motion in areas where coverage is undesired, for instance, due to reflections of sound waves around corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology comparison of Motion Sensors|url=http://www.ecosirius.com/technology%20-%20page%201.html|website=ecosirius.com|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such extended coverage may be desirable for lighting control, where the goal is detection of any occupancy in an area. But for opening an automatic door, for example, a sensor selective to traffic in the path toward the door is superior. 
;Tomographic motion detector: These systems sense disturbances to radio waves as they pass from node to node of a mesh network. They have the ability to detect over large areas completely because they can sense through walls and other obstructions.
;Video camera software: With the proliferation of low-cost [[digital camera]]s able to shoot video, it is possible to use the output of such a camera to detect motion in its field of view using [[software]]. This solution is particularly attractive when the intent is to record video triggered by motion detection, as no hardware beyond the camera and computer is needed. Since the observed field may be normally illuminated, this may be considered another ''passive'' technology. However it can also be used together with [[near-infrared]] illumination to detect motion in the ''dark'', that is, with the illumination at a wavelength undetectable by a human eye.
;Gesture detector: Photodetectors and infrared lighting elements can support digital screens to detect hand motions and gestures with the aid of machine learning algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Cho |first=Youngjun |year=2014 |title= US patent: Electronic device having proximity touch function and control method thereof |url=http://www.google.com/patents/US20150062087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual-technology motion detectors==
Many modern motion detectors use combinations of different technologies. While combining multiple sensing technologies into one detector can help reduce false triggering, it does so at the expense of reduced detection probabilities and increased vulnerability.{{Fact|date=January 2017}} For example, many dual-tech sensors combine both a PIR sensor and a microwave sensor into one unit. For motion to be detected, both sensors must trip together.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} This lowers the probability of a false alarm since heat and light changes may trip the PIR but not the microwave, or moving tree branches may trigger the microwave but not the PIR. If an intruder is able to fool either the PIR or microwave, however, the sensor will not detect it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Often, PIR technology is paired with another model to maximize accuracy and reduce energy use.{{Fact|date=January 2017}}  PIR draws less energy than emissive microwave detection, and so many sensors are calibrated so that when the PIR sensor is tripped, it activates a microwave sensor.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}  If the latter also picks up an intruder, then the alarm is sounded.

&lt;/ref&gt;  Later it was used for natural gas exploration in the UK section of the North Sea. In 1967, ''Mr. Louie'' was a part of the unique action for that time when for the first time in the North Sea, it went to dock for reparations and maintenance and was replaced by another rig (''Orion'') during the drilling.&lt;ref name=hill&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  After the structural repairs and maintenance work at [[Bremerhaven]], ''Mr. Louie'' continued drilling at the North Sea for the Gas Council – [[Amoco]] group.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

After the North Sea, ''Mr. Louie'' was moved to [[West Africa]]. Between 1977 and 1978 it drilled six appraisal wells at the Saltpond Oil Field in offshore Ghana.  After completing the drilling in 1978, ''Mr. Louie'' was converted into an oil platform at this field.&lt;ref name=COVER&gt;{{cite web

An '''oil burner''' is a heating device which burns #1, #2 and #6 [[heating oil|heating oils]], [[diesel fuel]] or other similar [[fuel oil|fuels]]. In the United States ultra low #2 diesel is the common fuel used.  It is dyed red to show that it is road-tax exempt.  In most markets of the United States heating oil is the same specification of fuel as on-road un-dyed diesel.  

An oil burner is a part attached to an oil furnace, water heater, or boiler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thermopride.com/products/oil-products/|title=Thermopride Oil Furnaces|first=|date=March 28, 2018|website=http://www.thermopride.com/products/oil-products/|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It provides the ignition of heating oil/biodiesel fuel used to heat either air or water via a heat exchanger.  The fuel is [[Atomizer nozzle|atomized]] into a fine spray usually by forcing it under pressure through a [[nozzle]] which gives the resulting flame a specific flow rate, angle of spray and pattern (variations of a cone shape). This spray is usually ignited by an [[electric spark]] with the air being forced through around it at the end of a blast tube, by a fan driven by the oil burner motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Home Heating &amp; Air Conditioning Systems |author= James L. Kittle|year=1990|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0830632573&amp;id=f5Md9EaJ-xEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=GeVhH98zFc&amp;dq=%22Oil+Burner%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=-kcv0gXQHE68o3PzzUNbkR5rH_w|isbn=0-8306-3257-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fuel pump is typically driven via a coupling connecting its shaft to that of the motor's. Oil burners also include combustion-proving devices to prevent out-of-control combustion - Primary Control; Safety Control; Cad Cell Control; Master Control; Fire-Eye Control are all common names for the 'combustion safety control'.

In the United States residential home heating oil market the "vaporizing gun burner" is the most common mechanical device used to heat a home or small commercial forced air space with&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.beckettcorp.com/|title=Beckett Burner Corp|last=|first=|date=March 28, 2018|website=https://www.beckettcorp.com/|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on the manufacturer these simple burners will see a lifespan if regularly maintained for decades.  Currently, old installations from the 1950s and 1960s are still in operation today if they received regular maintenance.  

The maintenance involved in a gun burner usually is a replacement of the nozzle used to atomize the fuel, replacing the filter located at the air handler, replacing the fuel filter on the heating oil system from the tank, cleaning out any soot or deposits in the heat exchanger of the furnace, and ensuring the system is in good working order, and also involves checking and adjusting the fuel-air mixture for efficiency with a combustion analyzer.  

If a heating oil burner runs out of oil it often must be [https://www.staroilco.net/how-do-you-restart-your-oil-furnace-after-running-out-of-oil/ primed to be restarted].  Priming involves purging any air from the fuel lines so that a steady flow of oil can find its way to the burner. 

If an oil burner wears out it can usually be upgraded and replaced with a more efficient modern burner. If the heat exchanger wears out that requires a new furnace. Oil furnaces will last nearly forever if maintained regularly ensuring the heat exchanger is vacuumed out and cleaned. Oil burners deposit soot in the heat exchanger which is an un-even insulator.  The heat distribution in the heat exchanger is un-even causing wear on this critical steel part causing an eventual cracking.  Annual or every other year tune-ups guarantee this wear is far reduced.  Oil furnace lifespans of fifty to seventy-five years with regular service is not uncommon compared to an average wear out of natural gas furnaces every twenty years. 

==Fuel injection==
[[File:Zerstäuberdüse Oelbrenner FA Steinen.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Used nozzles from an oil burner]]
Fuel is injected into the combustion chamber by a [[spray nozzle]].

The nozzles are usually supplied with high pressure oil. Because [[erosion]] from friction with the oil, and possible blockage due to lumps in it, they need replacement when worn. Fuel nozzles are usually rated in [[Volume flow rate|fuel volume flow per unit time]] e.g. USGal/h (U.S. Gallons per hour).

A fuel nozzle is characterized by three features:
* Flow at 100psi pump pressure (e.g. 0.65 USGal/h)
* Spray characteristic (e.g. "S")
* Spray angle (e.g. 60 °)

Alternatively fuel may be passed over a tiny [[:wikt:orifice|orifice]] fed with compressed air. This arrangement is referred to as Babington atomiser/nozzle, named after its inventor Robert Babington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert S. BABINGTON Nebulizer Fuel Burner|url=http://www.rexresearch.com/babingtn/babingtn.htm|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the oil flows over the nozzle, the fuel needn't be under any great pressure. If the pump can handle such the oil may even contain lumps such as scraps of food. Because it is only compressed air that passes through the orifice hole, such nozzles do not suffer much from erosion.

== Oil pump ==
[[File:Internal gear pump.gif|thumb|150px|Oil pump]]
A [[gear pump]] of two parts:

===Gear pump assembly===
This pumps the oil in and increases the pressure in the nozzles to 15 bar maximum (217.5 psi). Usually a [[gerotor]] of the sickle type is used. Gear pumps are used frequently in oil burners because of their simplicity, stability and low price.

===Pressure regulator===
To set the heat output of the burner, the rate of fuel delivery via the nozzle must be adjustable. This is often achieved by an adjustable [[pressure relief valve]] between the pump and the nozzle. When the set pressure is reached (usually 100psi), this valve opens and allows excess oil to flow through a bypass back to the fuel tank or the pump suction side.

== Electromagnetic valve ==
[[File:Light fuel oil burner.JPG|thumb|right|A small two-stage industrial burner. The blue cubes are the coils of the two electromagnetic valves.]]
This allows fuel to be shut off from the sprayer by electrical control. It helps avoid drips when the valve is closed. It also eases the purging of the burner (and any boiler) of fuel mist during startup, or while restarting after a misfire. If the burner were not purged the oil/air mixture could explode dangerously.

== Fan ==
The fan blows [[air]] into the combustion chamber. The [[Pistonless rotary engine|rotor]] of the fan is powered by an [[electric motor]].

==Igniters==
Some oil burners use glow bars which operate much like the [[glow plug]]s of a diesel engine.

Many use high voltage generated by a voltage-step up transformer to create a spark for ignition, somewhat similar to a [[spark plug]].

Original oil burner transformers were copper wire conductors wrapped around an iron core. A standard type of transformer to this day. In the mid-90s electronic igniters replaced the copper and iron transformer, solving many problems related to the old style transformer. This new technology in igniters would soon replace all old style transformers throughout the oil burner industry. The new igniters would run cooler so the output voltage could be increased from 10,000 to 20,000 VAC.

This increase of voltage would be more reliable, reduce delayed ignition, run cooler and all while using less energy. The voltage is high, but a standard igniter will only pull around 35 milliamps.

== Safety control==
[[File:LDR07 Light-dependent CdS photoresistor.jpg|thumb|60px|LDR]]
Oil-fired burners are fitted with a safety mechanism for determining if the fuel has ignited and a flame present.  The terms "primary control", "safety control", "cad cell control", "master control", and "fire-eye control" are variously used to describe a light dependent electrical resistor ([[Photoresistor|LDR]]) which detects the flame whose value changes by the amount of [[light]] it is exposed to. The resistance decreases as the LDR is exposed to more light. The material is usually [[cadmium]] [[sulfide]], hence the name "cad cell" for this component. In darkness the resistance is around 1 MΩ, while when exposed to light from a properly ignited flame the resistance is significantly lower, around 75–300 Ω.

Older oil burners were equipped with a primary control installed on the exhaust stack with a bimetallic heat sensing element protruding into the stack, such a control was referred to as a "stack relay" or a "stack control". It performed the same function as the newer cad-cell control but instead of sensing light from the burner flame it sensed heat from the flame exhaust gases to prove that ignition took place.

== Capacitor start motor ==
[[File:Condensatormotor.svg|thumb|left|200px|Schematic of a capacitor start motor.]]
The motor which drives the fan and the oil pump is usually a 
[[AC motor#Capacitor start motor|capacitor start motor]]. It is a vortex shortage tank motor because it also contains a [[short cage]] or [[Cage (enclosure)|cage]] holds. The difference with a three-phase motor is in the [[stator]]. Where the vortex power motor has three coils aligned at 120° in the stator, the capacitor start motor holds one main winding and one auxiliary winding aligned at 90°. The phase shift of 90° between the main winding and the auxiliary winding is achieved by a connected capacitor which feeds the auxiliary winding and is connected on the single-phase AC mains. The capacitor will achieve a phase shift of 90° between the main and the auxiliary winding, producing an acceptable initial torque. This motor is intended for continuous operation.

[[File:orrery small.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A small orrery showing earth and the inner planets]]

An '''orrery''' is a mechanical [[Solar system model|model of the solar system]] that illustrates or predicts the relative positions and motions of the [[planet]]s and [[natural satellite|moon]]s, usually according to the [[heliocentric]] [[Scientific modelling|model]]. It may also represent the relative sizes of these bodies; but since accurate scaling is often not practical due to the actual large ratio differences, a subdued approximation may be used instead. Though the Greeks had working [[planetaria]], the first orrery that was a planetarium of the modern era was produced in 1704, and one was presented to [[Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery]] – whence came the name. They are typically driven by a [[clockwork]] mechanism with a globe representing the [[Sun]] at the centre, and with a planet at the end of each of the arms.

The [[Antikythera mechanism]], discovered in 1900 in a wreck off the Greek island of [[Antikythera]] and extensively studied, exhibited the [[diurnal motion]]s of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and the five known [[planet]]s. It has been dated between 150 and 100 BC. The Antikythera hand driven mechanism is now considered one of the first orreries, but for many decades was ignored as it was thought to be far too complex to be genuine.&lt;ref name="HMSO"&gt;{{cite book|last=Calvert|first=H.R.|title=Astronomy: Globes Orreries and other Models |publisher=H.M.S.O|location=London|date=1967|asin=B001A9C9SQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was [[geocentric]] and used as a mechanical calculator designed to calculate astronomical positions.

According to [[Cicero]], the Roman philosopher who was writing in the first century BC, [[Posidonius]] constructed a planetary model.

In 1348, [[Giovanni Dondi dell'Orologio|Giovanni Dondi]] built the first known clock driven mechanism which displays the ecliptical position of [[Moon]], [[Sun]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]] according to the complicated ptolemeic planetary theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Henry C.|last2=Millburn|first2=John R.|title=Geared to the stars : the evolution of planetariums, orreries, and astronomical clocks|date=1978|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|location=Toronto|isbn=0-8020-2312-6|pages=28–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|first1=H.

As late as 1650, P. Schirleus built a geocentric [[planetarium]] with the Sun as a planet, and with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] and [[Venus]] revolving around the Sun as its [[Natural satellite|moon]]s.&lt;ref name="EE"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewster|first=David|title=The Edinburgh Encyclopedia |publisher=William Blackwood et al.|location=Edinburgh|date=1830|volume=16|pages=624|chapter=Planetary Machines|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q2tTt_NNr2YC&amp;pg=PA646#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the court of [[William IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel]] two complicated astronomic clocks were built in 1561 and 1563-1568, which show on four sites the ecliptical position of [[Sun]], [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], the [[Moon]], Sun and Dragon (Nodes of the Moon) according to [[Ptolemy]], a Calendar, the Sunrise and Sunset and an automated [[celestial sphere]] with an animated Sun symbol which, for the first time on a celestial globe, show the real position of the sun, including the equation of time.&lt;ref name=Lloyd2&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lloyd|first1=Alan|title=Some Outstanding Clocks Over Seven Hundred Years|date=1958|publisher=Leonard Hill Books Limited|pages=46–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poulle|first1=Emmanuel|author1-link=Emmanuel Poulle|last2=Sändig|first2=Helmut|last3=Schardin|first3=Joachim|last4=Hasselmeyer|first4=Lothar|title=Die Planetenlaufuhr : ein Meisterwerk der Astronomie und Technik der Renaissance geschaffen von Eberhard Baldewein 1563 - 1568|date=2008|publisher=Dt.

In ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'', published in Nuremberg in 1543, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] challenged the Western teaching of a [[Geocentric model|geocentric]] universe in which the Sun revolved daily around the [[Earth]]. He observed that some Greek philosophers had proposed a heliocentric universe. This simplified the apparent [[epicycle|epicyclic]] motions of the planets, making it feasible to represent the planets' paths as simple circles. This could be modelled by the use of gears. [[Tycho Brahe]]'s improved instruments made precise observations of the skies (1576–1601), and from these [[Johannes Kepler]] (1621) deduced that planets orbited the Sun in [[ellipse]]s. In 1687 [[Isaac Newton]] explained the cause of elliptic motion in his [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|theory of gravitation]].&lt;ref name="Ronan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ronan|first=Colin |title=The Practical Astronomer|publisher=Bloomsbury Books|location=London|origyear=First published 1981|date=1992|pages=108–112|isbn=1-85471-047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To put this in chronological context, in 1762 [[John Harrison]]'s [[marine chronometer]] first enabled accurate measurement of [[longitude]]. In 1766, astronomer [[Johann Daniel Titius]] first demonstrated that the mean distance of each planet from the Sun could be represented by the following progression:

&lt;small&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{4+0}{10},\frac{4+3}{10},\frac{4+6}{10},\frac{4+12}{10},\frac{4+24}{10},\frac{4+48}{10},.....&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

That is, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, 1.6, 2.8, 5.2 ... The numbers refer to [[astronomical unit]]s, the mean distance between Sun and Earth, which is 1.496 × 10⁸ km (93 × 10⁶ miles). The Derby Orrery does not show mean distance, but demonstrated the relative planetary movements.

[[Eisinga Planetarium|Eisinga's Planetarium]] was built from 1774 to 1781 by Eise Eisinga in his home in [[Franeker]], in the Netherlands. It displays the planets across the width of a room's ceiling, and has been in operation almost continually since it was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetarium-friesland.nl/en|title=Welcome - Planetarium Friesland|website=www.planetarium-friesland.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; This orrery is a planetarium in both senses of the word: a complex machine showing planetary orbits, and a theatre for depicting the planets' movement. Eisinga house was bought by the Dutch Royal family who gave him a pension.
[[File:Planetarium in Putnam Gallery 2, 2009-11-24.jpg|thumb|A 1766 Benjamin Martin Orrery, used at Harvard]]

In 1764, Benjamin Martin devised a new type of planetary model, in which the planets were carried on brass arms leading from a series of concentric or coaxial tubes. With this construction it was difficult to make the planets revolve, and to get the moons to turn around the planets. Martin suggested that the conventional orrery should consist of three parts: the planetarium where the planets revolved around the Sun, the [[tellurion]] (also ''tellurian'' or ''tellurium'') which showed the inclined axis of the Earth and how it revolved around the Sun, and the lunarium which showed the eccentric rotations of the Moon around the Earth. In one orrery, these three motions could be mounted on a common table, separately using the central spindle as a prime mover.&lt;ref name="HMSO"/&gt;

== Explanation ==

All orreries are ''planetariums'' or ''planetaria'' (alternative plural). The term '''orrery''' has only existed since 1714. A '''grand orrery''' is one that includes the [[outer planets]] known at the time of its construction. The word [[planetarium]] has been captured, and now usually refers to hemispherical theatres in which images of the night sky are projected onto an overhead surface. Planetariums (orreries) can range widely in size from hand-held to room-sized. An orrery is used to demonstrate the motion of the planets, while a mechanical device used to predict [[eclipse]]s and [[Astronomical transit|transits]] is called an [[astrarium]].

An orrery should properly include the Sun, the Earth and the Moon (plus optionally other planets). A model that only includes the Earth, the Moon and the Sun is called a [[tellurion]] or tellurium, and one which only includes the Earth and the Moon is a [[lunarium]]. A [[jovilabe]] is a model of [[Jupiter]] and its moons.&lt;ref name="OU_S100_22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pentz|first=M.J.|title=The Earth, Its Shape, Internal Structure and Composition|publisher=[[Open University Press]]|location=Bletchley|date=1971|volume=OU_S100_22|isbn=978-0-335-02034-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A planetarium will show the ''orbital period'' of each planet and the ''rotation rate'', as shown in the table above.

Orreries are usually not built to [[scale model|scale]]. Human orreries, where humans move about as the planets, have also been constructed, but most are temporary. There is a permanent human orrery at [[Armagh Observatory]] in [[Northern Ireland]], which has the six ancient planets, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], and comets [[Halley's Comet|Halley]] and [[Comet Encke|Encke]]. Uranus and beyond are also shown, but in a fairly limited way.&lt;ref name="Armagh Observatory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://star.arm.ac.uk/orrery|title=Armagh Observatory Human Orrery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is at Sky's the Limit Observatory and Nature Center in Twentynine Palms, CA.  This is a true to scale (20 billion to one), true to position (accurate to within four days) human orrery.  The first four planets are relatively close to one another, but the next four require a certain amount of hiking in order to visit them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysthelimit29.org/orrery.html|title=Sky's the Limit Observatory and Nature Center Human Orrery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A normal mechanical clock could be used to produce an extremely simple orrery with the Sun in the centre, [[Earth]] on the minute hand and [[Jupiter]] on the hour hand; Earth would make 12 revolutions around the Sun for every 1 revolution of Jupiter. Note however that Jupiter's actual year is 11.86 Earth years long, so this particular example would lose accuracy rapidly. A real orrery would be more accurate and include more planets, and would perhaps make the planets rotate as well.

==Projection orreries==

Many planetariums (buildings) have a [[Planetarium projector|projection orrery]], which projects onto the dome of the planetarium a Sun with either dots or small images of the planets. These usually are limited to the planets from [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] to [[Saturn]], although some include [[Uranus]]. The light sources for the planets are projected onto mirrors which are geared to a motor which drives the images on the dome. Typically the Earth will circle the Sun in one minute, while the other planets will complete an orbit in time periods proportional to their actual motion. Thus Venus, which takes 224.7 days to orbit the Sun, will take 37 seconds to complete an orbit on an orrery, and Jupiter will take 11 minutes, 52 seconds.

Some planetariums have taken advantage of this to use orreries to simulate planets and their moons. Thus Mercury orbits the Sun in 0.24 of an Earth year, while [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] and [[Deimos (moon)|Deimos]] orbit [[Mars]] in a similar 4:1 time ratio. Planetarium operators wishing to show this have placed a red cap on the Sun (to make it resemble Mars) and turned off all the planets but Mercury and Earth. Similar tricks can be used to show [[Pluto]] and its five moons.

==Notable orreries==

[[File:Thinktank Birmingham - object 1956S00682.00001(1).jpg|thumb|An orrery made by [[Robert Brettell Bate]], circa 1812. Now in [[Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum]]. ]]

Shoemaker [[John Fulton (instrument maker)|John Fulton]] of Fenwick, Ayrshire, built three between 1823 and 1833. The last is in Glasgow's [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]].

The [[Eisinga Planetarium|Franeker Planetarium]] built by a [[Carding|wool carder]] named Eise Eisinga in his own living room, in the small city of [[Franeker]] in [[Friesland]], is in fact an orrery. It was constructed between 1774 and 1781. The "face" of the model looks down from the ceiling of a room, with most of the mechanical works in the space above the ceiling. It is driven by a pendulum clock, which has 9 weights or ponds. The planets move around the model in real time.&lt;ref name="Sixma"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sixma|first=H|date=November 1934|title=The Franeker Planetarium|journal=Popular Astronomy|publisher=SAO/NASA ADS|volume=XLII|issue=9|pages=489–495|url=http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1934PA.....42..489S&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=0&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES|accessdate=2011-06-22|bibcode=1934PA.....42..489S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An innovative concept is to have people play the role of the moving planets and other Solar System objects. Such a model, called a human orrery, has been laid out with precision at the [[Armagh Observatory]].&lt;ref name="Armagh Observatory"/&gt;

[[File:LEO Propellant Depot.jpg|thumb|Artist's concept of a proposed [[United Launch Alliance]] propellant depot with sun shields.]]

An orbital '''propellant depot''' is a cache of [[propellant]] that is placed in orbit around Earth or another body to allow [[spacecraft]] or the transfer stage of the spacecraft to be fueled in space.  It is one of the types of space resource depot that have been proposed for enabling infrastructure-based [[space exploration]].&lt;ref name=iac2012/&gt;
Many different depot concepts exist depending on the type of fuel to be supplied, location, or type of depot which may also include a '''propellant tanker''' that  delivers a single load to a spacecraft at a specified orbital location and then departs.  In-space fuel depots are not necessarily located near or at a [[space station]].

Potential users of in-orbit refueling and storage facilities include [[List of space agencies|space agencies]], defense ministries and [[communications satellite]] or other [[private spaceflight|commercial]] companies.

Satellite servicing depots would extend the lifetime of satellites that have nearly consumed all of their orbital maneuvering fuel and are likely placed in a geosynchronous orbit. The spacecraft would conduct a [[space rendezvous]] with the depot, or ''vice versa'', and then transfer propellant to be used for subsequent [[orbital maneuver]]s. In 2011, [[Intelsat]] showed interest in an [[Space Infrastructure Servicing|initial demonstration mission]] to refuel several satellites in [[geosynchronous orbit]], but all plans have been since scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.space.com/14287-satellite-refueling-deal-scrapped-mda-intelsat.html |title=Plans Scrapped for Private Robotic Gas Station in Space |work=Space.com |first=Charles Q. |last=Choi |date=January 19, 2012 |access-date=January 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A low earth orbit (LEO) depot's primary function would be to provide propellant to a transfer stage headed to the moon, Mars, or possibly a geosynchronous orbit.  Since all or a fraction of the transfer stage propellant can be off-loaded, the separately launched spacecraft with payload and/or crew could have a larger mass or use a smaller launch vehicle.  With a LEO depot or tanker fill, the size of the launch vehicle can be reduced and the flight rate increased—or, with a newer mission architecture where the beyond-Earth-orbit spacecraft also serves as the second stage, can facilitate much larger payloads—which may reduce the total launch costs since the fixed costs are spread over more flights and fixed costs are usually lower with smaller launch vehicles.  A depot could also be placed at Earth-Moon [[Lagrangian point|Lagrange point]] 1 (EML-1) or behind the Moon at EML-2 to reduce costs to travel to the moon or Mars.  Placing a depot in Mars orbit has also been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf |title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots |author=Jon Goff |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2009 |display-authors=etal}} page 13&lt;/ref&gt;

== LEO depot fuels ==
For rockets and space vehicles, propellants usually take up 2/3 or more of their total mass.

Large upper-stage rocket engines generally use a [[cryogenic fuel]] like [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]] (LOX) as an oxidizer because of the large specific impulse possible, but must carefully consider a problem called "boil off". The boil off from only a few days of delay  may not allow sufficient fuel for higher orbit injection, potentially resulting in a mission abort. Lunar or Mars missions will require weeks to months to accumulate tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilograms of propellant, so additional equipment may be required on the transfer stage or the depot to mitigate boiloff.

Non-cryogenic, earth-storable [[liquid rocket propellants]] including [[RP-1]] ([[kerosene]]), [[hydrazine]] and [[nitrogen tetroxide]] (NTO), and mildly cryogenic, space-storable propellants like [[liquid methane]] and [[liquid oxygen]], can be kept in liquid form with less boiloff than the cryogenic fuels, but also have lower specific impulse.&lt;ref name=aiaa2004&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2014/37950 |title=Advanced Space Storable Propellants for Outer Planet Exploration |conference=40th AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit, Ft.

== Propellant launch costs ==
Ex-NASA administrator Mike Griffin commented at the 52nd AAS Annual Meeting in Houston, November 2005, that "at a conservatively low government price of $10,000/kg in LEO, 250 MT of fuel for two missions per year is worth $2.5 B, at government rates."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/138033main_griffin_aas1.pdf Remarks For AIAA Space 2005 Conference &amp; Exhibition&lt;/ref&gt;

If one assumes that a 130 metric tonne launch vehicle could be flown twice a year for $2.5B, the price is about $10,000/kg.

== Cryogenic depot architectures and types ==
In the depot-centric architecture, the depot is filled by tankers, and then the propellant is transferred to an upper stage prior to orbit insertion, similar to a gas station filled by tankers for automobiles.  By using a depot, the launch vehicle size can be reduced and the flight rate increased.  Since the accumulation of propellant may take many weeks to months, careful consideration must be given to boiloff mitigation.

In simple terms, a passive cryogenic depot is a transfer stage with stretched propellant tanks, additional insulation, and a sun shield.  In one concept, hydrogen boiloff is also redirected to reduce or eliminate liquid oxygen boiloff and then used for attitude control, power, or reboost.  An active cryogenic depot is a passive depot with additional power and refrigeration equipment/cryocoolers to reduce or eliminate propellant boiloff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf |title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots |author=Jon Goff |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2009 |display-authors=etal}} page 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Other active cryogenic depot concepts include electrically powered attitude control equipment to conserve fuel for the end payload.

== Heavy lift versus depot-centric architectures ==
In the heavy lift architecture, propellant, which can be two thirds or more of the total mission mass, is accumulated in fewer launches and possibly shorter time frame than the depot centric architecture.  Typically the transfer stage is filled directly and no depot is included in the architecture.  For cryogenic vehicles and cryogenic depots, additional boiloff mitigation equipment is typically included on the transfer stage, reducing payload fraction and requiring more propellant for the same payload unless the mitigation hardware is expended.

Heavy lift advocates{{who|date=February 2013}} state that the total mass to orbit required for a mission can actually increase because of the need to launch more propellant tanks and boil-off mitigation hardware.  Heavy launch vehicles are not developed, so these costs are added to the trade, rather than using existing smaller rockets.  Heavy lift advocates{{who|date=February 2013}} question the cost model for propellant depots and cite the need for development and demonstration.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Depot advocates claim this increase in mission mass would be offset by a decrease in the cost per launch and the elimination of the fixed costs of the heavy lift launch vehicle when not required in a given time frame.  Further, long life components including insulation, power and cryocoolers could be placed on the depot and not expended, further reducing the mass per mission and hence costs.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Heavy Lift is compared with using Commercial Launch and Propellant Depots in this power point by Dr. Alan Wilhite given at FISO Telecon.&lt;ref name=PDref049&gt;{{cite web |last=Dr Alan Wilhite |title=A Sustainable Evolved Human Space Exploration Architecture Using Commercial Launch and Propellant Depots |url=http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Wilhite_2-13-13/Wilhite_2-13-13.pdf |publisher=FISO Telecon (February 13, 2013) |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704093405/http://spirit.as.utexas.edu/~fiso/telecon/Wilhite_2-13-13/Wilhite_2-13-13.pdf |archive-date=July 4, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feasibility of propellant depots ==

Both theoretical studies and funded development projects that are currently underway aim to provide insight into the feasibility of propellant depots. Studies have shown that a depot-centric architecture with smaller launch vehicles could be {{USD|57 billion}} less expensive than a heavy-lift architecture over a 20-year time frame.&lt;ref name="images.spaceref.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://images.spaceref.com/news/2011/F9Prop.Depot.pdf |title=Near Term Space Exploration with Commercial Launch Vehicles Plus Propellant Depot |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology / National Institute of Aerospace |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The cost of large launch vehicles is so high that a depot able to hold the propellant lifted by two or more medium-sized launch vehicles may be cost effective and support more payload mass on [[beyond Earth orbit|beyond-Earth orbit]] trajectories.

In a 2010 NASA study, an additional flight of an [[Ares V|Ares V heavy]] launch vehicle was required to stage a US government Mars reference mission due to 70 tons of boiloff, assuming 0.1% boiloff/day for [[hydrolox]] propellant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20100042324 |title=Ares V Utilization in Support of a Human Mission to Mars |author=J. Holiday |date=November 1, 2010 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study clearly identified the need to decrease the design boiloff rate by an order of magnitude or more.

Approaches to the design of [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) propellant depots were also  discussed in the  [[Review of United States Human Space Flight Plans Committee|2009 Augustine report]] to [[NASA]], which "examined the [then] current concepts for in-space refueling."&lt;ref name=hsf200910&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/396093main_HSF_Cmte_FinalReport.pdf HSF Final Report: Seeking a Human Spaceflight Program Worthy of a Great Nation], October 2009, ''Review of U.S. Human Spaceflight Plans Committee'', p. 65-66.&lt;/ref&gt;  The report determined there are essentially two approaches to refueling a [[spacecraft]] in LEO:&lt;ref name=hsf200910/&gt;
* '''Propellant tanker'''&lt;!-- Bolded per [[WP:MOS]]/[[WP:MOSBOLD]] since this term is redirected to here. --&gt; delivery. In this approach, a single tanker performs a rendezvous and docking with an on-orbit spacecraft.  The tanker then transfers propellant, then departs.  This approach is "much like an [[Aerial refueling|airborne tanker]] refuels an aircraft."
* In-space depot.  An alternative approach is for many tankers to rendezvous and transfer propellant to an orbital depot.  Then, at a later time, a spacecraft may dock with the depot and receive a propellant load before departing Earth orbit.
Both approaches were considered feasible with 2009 spaceflight technology, but anticipated that significant further engineering development and in-space demonstration would be required before missions could depend on the technology. Both approaches were seen to offer the potential of long-term life-cycle savings.&lt;ref name=hsf200910/&gt;

Beyond theoretical studies, since at least 2016, [[SpaceX]] has undertaken funded [[New product development|development]] of an [[Interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] set of technologies called the [[Interplanetary Transport System]] (ITS).  While the [[system]] consists of a combination of [[Interplanetary_Transport_System#Description|several elements]] that are considered by SpaceX to be key to making long-duration [[beyond Earth orbit]] (BEO) spaceflights possible by reducing the cost per ton delivered to Mars by multiple [[orders of magnitude]] over what NASA approaches have achieved,&lt;ref name="spacex-itsvideo201609-09:20"&gt;

refilling of propellants in orbit is one of the four key elements.  In a novel mission architecture, the SpaceX design intends to enable the [[Interplanetary Spaceship|long-journey spacecraft]] to expend most all of its propellant load during the launch to [[low Earth orbit]] while it serves as the second stage of the [[ITS launch vehicle|launch vehicle]], and then—after refilling on orbit by an ''[[ITS tanker]]''—provide the significant amount of [[delta-V|energy]] necessary to put the spacecraft onto an interplanetary trajectory. The ''ITS tanker'' is designed to transport approximately {{convert|380|tonne|lb}} of propellant to low Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=sfi20160927&gt;

A second propellant tanker concept is underway.

The baseline 41-mT propellant load is contained in a 5m diameter, common bulkhead stage that is about the same length as ULA's existing upper stages.

Because a large portion of a rocket is propellant at time of launch, proponents point out several advantages of using a propellant depot architecture.

== History and plans ==

Propellant depots were proposed as part of the [[Space Transportation System]] (along with nuclear "tugs" to take payloads from LEO to other destinations) in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name=dewar2003&gt;Dewar, James.  "To The End Of The Solar System: The Story Of The Nuclear Rocket".  Apogee, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, the [[U.S. Air Force|Air Force]] and [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) performed an experimental [[low Earth orbit|on-orbit]] demonstration on a modified [[Centaur (rocket stage)#Test bed for cryogenic fluid management experiments|Centaur upper stage]] on the [[DMSP-18]] [[Atlas V#Atlas V launches&lt;!-- Atlas launch ID "AV-017" --&gt;|launch]] to improve "understanding of [[Propellant depot#Propellant settling|propellant settling]] and [[Slosh dynamics|slosh]], pressure control, [[RL10]] chilldown and RL10 two-phase shutdown operations."  "The light weight of DMSP-18 allowed {{convert|12000|lbs}} of remaining LO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and LH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; propellant, 28% of Centaur’s capacity," for the [[low Earth orbit|on-orbit]] demonstrations.  The post-spacecraft mission extension ran 2.4 hours before executing the [[Orbital maneuver#Impulsive maneuvers|deorbit burn]].&lt;ref name=ula200910&gt;

NASA's [[Launch Services Program]] is working on an ongoing [[Launch Services Program#Slosh Fluid Dynamics Experiments|slosh fluid dynamics experiments]] with partners called CRYOTE. ULA is also currently&lt;!-- 2010, and now also in Aug 2011 --&gt; planning additional in-space laboratory experiments to further develop [[Centaur (rocket stage)#Test bed for cryogenic fluid management experiments|cryogenic fluid management]] technologies using the Centaur upper stage after primary payload separation.

The "Simple Depot" mission was proposed by NASA in 2011 as a potential first PTSD mission, with launch no earlier than 2015, on an [[Atlas V#Versions|Atlas V 551]].  ''Simple Depot'' would utilize the "used" (nearly-emptied) [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage LH2 tank for long-term storage of LO2 while LH2 will be stored in the Simple Depot LH2 module, which is launched with only ambient-temperature gaseous Helium in it.  The SD LH2 tank was to be {{convert|3|m}} diameter and {{convert|16|m}} long, {{convert|110|m3}} in volume, and store 5 mT of LH2.  "At a useful mixture ratio (MR) of 6:1 this quantity of LH2 can be paired with 25.7 mT of LO2, allowing for 0.7 mT of LH2 to be used for vapor cooling, for a total useful propellant mass of 30 mT. ... the described depot will have a boil-off rate of approaching 0.1 percent per day, consisting entirely of hydrogen."&lt;ref name=ns20110810&gt;

In September 2010, ULA released a ''Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture'' concept to propose propellant depots that could be used as way-stations for other spacecraft to stop and refuel—either in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO)  for beyond-LEO missions, or at [[Lagrangian point]] {{L2}} for interplanetary missions—at the [[AIAA]] Space 2010 conference.  The concept proposes that waste gaseous [[hydrogen]]—an inevitable byproduct of long-term [[liquid hydrogen]] storage in the [[Radiative heat transfer|radiative heat]] environment of [[outer space|space]]—would be usable as a [[Monopropellant rocket|monopropellant]] in a [[Solar thermal rocket|solar-thermal propulsion system]].  The waste hydrogen would be productively utilized for both [[orbital stationkeeping]] and [[attitude control]], as well as providing limited propellant and thrust to use for [[Orbital maneuver#Non-impulsive maneuvers|orbital maneuvers]] to better [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with other spacecraft that would be inbound to receive fuel from the depot.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902p3&gt;

As part of the Depot-Based Space Transportation Architecture, ULA has proposed the [[Advanced Common Evolved Stage]] (ACES) [[upper stage]] [[rocket]].

== Engineering design issues ==
There are a number of design issues with propellant depots, as well as several tasks that have not, to date, been tested in space for [[On-orbit satellite servicing|on-orbit servicing]] missions.  The design issues include propellant settling and transfer, propellant usage for attitude control and reboost, the maturity of the refrigeration equipment/cryocoolers, and the power and mass required for reduced or zero boiloff depots with refrigeration.

=== Propellant settling ===
Transfer of liquid propellants in [[microgravity]] is complicated by the uncertain distribution of liquid and gasses within a tank. Propellant settling at an in-space depot is thus more challenging than in even a slight gravity field. ULA plans to use the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]]-18 mission to flight-test centrifugal propellant settling as a cryogenic fuel management technique that might be used in future propellant depots.&lt;ref name=goff2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/NearTermPropellantDepots.pdf |title=Realistic Near-Term Propellant Depots |author=Jon Goff |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |year=2009 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed Simple Depot PTSD mission utilizes several techniques to achieve adequate settling for propellant transfer.&lt;ref name=ns20110810/&gt;

=== Propellant transfer ===
In the absence of gravity, propellant transfer is somewhat more difficult, since liquids can float away from the inlet.

As part of the [[Orbital Express]] mission in 2007, [[hydrazine]] propellant was successfully transferred between two single-purpose designed technology demonstration spacecraft.  The [[Boeing]] servicing spacecraft [[ASTRO (satellite)|ASTRO]] transferred propellant to the [[Ball Aerospace]] serviceable client spacecraft [[NEXTSat]].  Since no crew were present on either spacecraft, this was reported as the first autonomous spacecraft-to-spacecraft fluid transfer.&lt;ref name="boeing20070417"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q2/070417c_nr.html |title=Boeing Orbital Express Conducts First Autonomous Spacecraft-to-Spacecraft Fluid and Component Transfer |publisher=Boeing |date=April 17, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070505101041/http://www.boeing.com/news/releases/2007/q2/070417c_nr.html |archivedate=May 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Refilling ===
After propellant has been transferred to a customer the depot's tanks will need refilling. Organizing the construction and [[space logistics|launch of the tanker rockets bearing the new fuel]] is the responsibility of the propellant depot's operator. Since space agencies like NASA hope to be purchasers rather than owners, possible operators include the aerospace company that constructed the depot, manufacturers of the rockets, a specialist space depot company, or an oil/chemical company that refines the propellant. By using several tanker rockets the tankers can be smaller than the depot and larger than the spacecraft they are intended to resupply.  Short range chemical propulsion tugs belonging to the depot may be used to simplify docking tanker rockets and large vehicles like Mars Transfer Vehicles.

Transfers of propellant between the LEO depot, reachable by rockets from Earth, and the deep space ones such as the [[Lagrange Point]]s and Phobos depots can be performed using [[Solar electric propulsion]] (SEP) tugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar_knowledge/connolly.pdf |title=Human Lunar Exploration Mission Architectures, page 22 |publisher=NASA |date=March 1–2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two missions are currently under development or proposed to support propellant depot refilling.  In addition to refueling and servicing [[geostationary]] communications satellites with the fuel that is initially launched with the MDA [[Space Infrastructure Servicing]] vehicle, the SIS vehicle is being designed to have the ability to [[orbital maneuver|orbitally maneuver]] to [[space rendezvous|rendezvous]] with a replacement fuel canister after transferring the {{nowrap|2000 kg}} of fuel in the launch load, enabling further refueling of additional satellites after the initial multi-satellite servicing mission is complete.&lt;ref name=sn20110318&gt;

These canisters would be much lighter than the SIS vehicle and thus much less expensive to launch.

The proposed Simple Depot cryogenic PTSD mission utilizes "remote berthing arm and docking and fluid transfer ports" both for propellant transfer to other vehicles, as well as for refilling the depot up to the full 30 tonne propellant capacity.&lt;ref name=ns20110810/&gt;

S.T. Demetriades&lt;ref name=Demetriades&gt;{{cite journal |last=Demetriades |first=S.T. |title=The Use of Atmospheric and Extraterrestrial Resources in Space Propulsion Systems |journal=Electric Propulsion Conference |date=March 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a method for refilling by collecting atmospheric gases. Moving in [[low Earth orbit]], at an altitude of around 120&amp;nbsp;km, Demetriades' proposed depot extracts air from the fringes of the atmosphere, compresses and cools it, and extracts liquid oxygen. The remaining nitrogen is used as propellant for a nuclear-powered [[magnetohydrodynamics|magnetohydrodynamic]] engine, which maintains the orbit, compensating for atmospheric [[Drag (physics)|drag]].&lt;ref name=Demetriades /&gt; This system was called “PROFAC” ([[Propulsive Fluid Accumulator|PROpulsive Fluid ACcumulator]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Demetrades |first=S.T. |title=Plasma Propulsion |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |date=April 1962 |volume=18 |issue=10 |pages=392 |bibcode=1962JBIS...18..392D}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, safety concerns with placing a nuclear reactor in low Earth orbit.

Demetriades' proposal was further refined by Christopher Jones and others&lt;ref&gt;Jones, C.,  Masse, D.,  Glass, C.,  Wilhite, A., and Walker, M. (2010), "PHARO: Propellant harvesting of atmospheric resources in orbit," IEEE Aerospace Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; In this proposal, multiple collection vehicles accumulate propellent gases at around 120&amp;nbsp;km altitude, later transferring them to a higher orbit. However, Jones' proposal does require a network of [[Space-based solar power|orbital power-beaming satellites]], to avoid placing nuclear reactors in orbit.

Asteroids can also be processed to provide liquid oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094576506001147 |title=A captured asteroid : Our David's stone for shielding earth and providing the cheapest extraterrestrial material |author=Didier Massonnet, Benoît Meyssignac |journal=Acta Astronautica |date=July–September 2006 |volume=59 |issue=1-5 |pages=77–83 |doi=10.1016/j.actaastro.2006.02.030 |bibcode=2006AcAau..59...77M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orbital planes and launch windows ===

Propellant depots in LEO are of little use for transfer between two low earth orbits when the depot is in a different orbital plane than the target orbit. The [[delta-v]] to make the necessary [[Orbital inclination change|plane change]] is typically extremely high. On the other hand, depots are typically proposed for exploration missions, where the change over time of the depot's orbit can be chosen to align with the departure vector. This allows one well-aligned departure time minimizing fuel use that requires a very precisely-timed departure. Less efficient departure times from the same depot to the same destination exist before and after the well-aligned opportunity, but more research is required to show whether the efficiency falls off quickly or slowly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}  By contrast, launching directly in only one launch from the ground without orbital refueling or docking with another craft already on orbit offers daily launch opportunities though it requires larger and more expensive launchers.&lt;ref name=spaceshow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thespaceshow.com/show/06-sep-2010/broadcast-1420-special-edition |title=Broadcast 1420 (Special Edition) |work=The Space Show |first1=David M. |last1=Livingston |first2=Dan |last2=Adamo |date=6 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The restrictions on departure windows arise because low earth orbits are susceptible to significant perturbations; even over short periods they are subject to [[nodal regression]] and, less importantly, [[precession]] of perigee. Equatorial depots are more stable but also more difficult to reach.&lt;ref name=spaceshow/&gt;

However, it is possible to do a three-burn orbital transfer which includes a plane change, and which wastes very little propellant to reach almost any final trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://selenianboondocks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/AAS-17-696-1.pdf |title=Practiacal Methodologies for Low Delta-V Penalty, On-Time Departures to Arbitrary Interplanetary Destinations From a Medium-Inclination Low-Earth Orbit Depot |conference=2017 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference. 20-24 August 2017.

=== Specific issues of cryogenic depots ===

==== Boil-off mitigation ====
Boil-off of [[cryogenic]] propellants in space may be mitigated by both technological solutions as well as system-level [[space logistics|planning and design]].
From a technical perspective:  for a propellant depot with passive insulation system to effectively store [[cryogenic]] fluids, boil-off caused by heating from [[Radiative heat transfer|solar]] and other sources must be mitigated, eliminated,&lt;ref name=goff2009/&gt; or used for economic purposes.&lt;ref name=aiaa20100902/&gt;  For non-cryogenic propellants, boil-off is not a significant design problem.

Boil off rate is governed by heat leakage and by the quantity of propellant in the tanks. With partially filled tanks, the percentage loss is higher. Heat leakage depends on surface area, while the original mass of propellant in the tanks depends on volume. So by the [[cube-square law]], the smaller the tank, the faster the liquids will boil off.
Some propellant tank designs have achieved a liquid hydrogen boil off rate as low as approximately 0.13% per day (3.8% per month) while the much higher temperature cryogenic fluid of liquid oxygen would boil off much less, about 0.016% per day (0.49% per month).&lt;ref name="Drawbacks ThinkQuest"&gt;{{cite web |title=Drawbacks of Cryogenic Propellants |publisher=Space Travel Guide on Oracle ThinkQuest Education Foundation |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/text/propulsion/propellents/crydraw.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628054254/http://library.thinkquest.org/03oct/02144/text/propulsion/propellents/crydraw.htm |archivedate=June 28, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to achieve zero boil-off (ZBO) with cryogenic propellant storage using an active thermal control system. Tests conducted at the NASA [[Glenn Research Center|Lewis Research Center]]'s Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility (SMIRF) over the summer of 1998 demonstrated that a hybrid thermal control system could eliminate boiloff of cryogenic propellants. The hardware consisted of a pressurized 50-ft³ (ca. 1416 litres) tank insulated with [[multi-layer insulation]] (MLI) of 34 layers, a condenser, and a [[Cryocooler#GM-refrigerators|Gifford-McMahon (GM) cryocooler]] that has a cooling capacity of 15 to 17.5 watt (W). Liquid hydrogen was the test fluid. The test tank was installed into a vacuum chamber, simulating space vacuum.&lt;ref name="SMIRF test"&gt;{{cite web |title=Zero Boiloff Storage of Cryogenic Propellants Achieved at Lewis’ Supplemental Multilayer Insulation Research Facility |publisher=Glenn Research Center |url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/RT1998/5000/5870plachta.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, a cooperative effort by NASA's [[Ames Research Center]], [[Glenn Research Center]], and [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) was implemented to develop zero-boiloff concepts for in-space cryogenic storage. Main program element was a large-scale, zero-boiloff demonstration using the MSFC multipurpose hydrogen test bed (MHTB) - 18.10 m3 LH2 tank (about 1300&amp;nbsp;kg of H2). A commercial cryocooler was interfaced with an existing MHTB spray bar mixer and insulation system in a manner that enabled a balance between incoming and extracted thermal energy.&lt;ref name="ZBO Large-Scale Demonstration"&gt;{{cite web |title=Large-Scale Demonstration of Liquid Hydrogen Storage With Zero Boiloff for In-Space Applications |publisher=Glenn Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20110004377_2011003898.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another NASA study in June 2003 for conceptual Mars mission showed mass savings over traditional, passive- only cryogenic storage when mission durations are 5 days in LEO for oxygen, 8.5 days for methane and 64 days for hydrogen. Longer missions equate to greater mass savings. Cryogenic xenon saves mass over passive storage almost immediately. When power to run the ZBO is already available, the break-even mission durations are even shorter, e.g. about a month for hydrogen. The larger the tank, the fewer days in LEO when ZBO has reduced mass.&lt;ref name="ZBO LEO"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Updated Zero Boil-Off Cryogenic Propellant Storage Analysis Applied to Upper Stages or Depots in an LEO Environment |publisher=Glenn Research Center |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030067928_2003079547.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to technical solutions to the challenge of excessive boil-off of cryogenic rocket propellants, system-level solutions have been proposed.  From a systems perspective, reductions in the standby time of the [[LH2]] cryogenic storage in order to achieve, effectively, a [[Just in time (business)|just in time]] (JIT) delivery to each customer, matched with the balanced [[Oil refinery|refinery]] technology to split the long-term storable feedstock—water—into the [[stoichiometric]] [[LOX]]/[[LH2]] necessary, is theoretically capable of achieving a system-level solution to boil-off.  Such proposals have been suggested as supplementing good technological techniques to reduce boil-off, but would not replace the need for efficient technological storage solutions.&lt;ref name=ss20121214&gt;

==== Sun shields ====
[[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA) has proposed a cryogenic depot which would use a conical sun shield to protect the cold propellants from solar and Earth radiation. The open end of the cone allows residual heat to radiate to the cold of deep space, while the closed cone layers attenuates the radiative heat from the Sun and Earth.&lt;ref name=Kutter2008&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ulalaunch.com/docs/publications/APracticalAffordableCryogenicPropellantDepotBasedonULAsFlightExperience20087644.pdf |title=A Practical, Affordable Cryogenic Propellant Depot Based on ULA’s Flight Experience |author=Bernard F.

==== Other issues ====
Other issues are [[hydrogen embrittlement]], a process by which some metals (including [[iron]] and [[titanium]]) become brittle and fracture following exposure to hydrogen. The resulting leaks makes storing cryogenic propellants in zero gravity conditions difficult.&lt;ref name="Hydrogen embrittlement"&gt;{{cite book |last=Jewett |first=R.P. |title=Hydrogen Environment Embrittlement of Metals |publisher=NASA CR-2163 |year=1973 |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In-space refueling demonstration projects ==

In the early 2010s, several in-space refueling projects got under-way.  Two [[Private spaceflight|private initiatives]] and a government-sponsored test mission were in some level of [[New product development|development]] or testing {{asof|2010|lc=y}}.

=== Robotic Refueling Mission ===

The NASA [[Robotic Refueling Mission]] was launched in 2011 and successfully completed a series of [[robotics|robotically-actuated]] [[propellant transfer]] experiments on the exposed facility platform of the International Space Station in January 2013.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125&gt;
{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |title=Satellite refueling testbed completes demo in orbit |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1301/25rrm/#.UQQMpvJ5GIR |accessdate=January 26, 2013 |newspaper=Spaceflight Now |date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The set of experiments included a number of propellant [[valve]]s, [[nozzle]]s and [[Seal (mechanical)|seals]] similar to those used on many satellites and a series of four [[prototype]] tools that could be attached to the distal end of a Space Station [[robotic arm]].  Each tool was a prototype of "devices that could be used by future satellite servicing missions to refuel spacecraft in orbit.  RRM is the first in-space refueling demonstration using a platform and fuel valve representative of most existing satellites, which were never designed for refueling. Other satellite servicing demos, such as the U.S. military's [[Orbital Express]] mission in 2007, transferred propellant between satellites with specially-built pumps and connections."&lt;ref name=sfn20130125/&gt;

=== MDA in-space refueling demonstration project ===
{{Main|MDA Space Infrastructure Servicing vehicle}}
{{as of|2010|03}}, a small-scale refueling demonstration project for [[reaction control system]] (RCS) fluids is under development. [[Canada]]-based [[MDA Corporation]] announced in early 2010 that they were designing a single spacecraft that would refuel other spacecraft in orbit as a satellite-servicing demonstration.  "The business model, which is still evolving, could ask customers to pay per kilogram of fuel successfully added to their satellite, with the per-kilogram price being a function of the additional revenue the operator can expect to generate from the spacecraft’s extended operational life."&lt;ref name=sn20100303&gt;
{{cite news |last=de Selding |first=Peter B. |title=MDA Designing In-orbit Servicing Spacecraft |url=http://spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100303-mda-planning-inorbit-servicing-demo.html |accessdate=March 14, 2011 |newspaper=Space News |date=March 3, 2010 |quote=''the refueling vehicle would dock at the target satellite’s apogee-kick motor, peel off a section of the craft’s thermal protection blanket, connect to a fuel-pressure line and deliver the propellant. MDA officials estimate the docking maneuver would take the communications satellite out of service for about 20 minutes. ... The servicing robot would have an in-orbit life of about five years, and would carry enough fuel to perform 10 or 11 satellite-refueling or orbital-cleanup missions.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130105074228/http://spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/100303-mda-planning-inorbit-servicing-demo.html |archivedate=January 5, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan is that the fuel-depot vehicle would [[Orbital maneuver|maneuver]] to an operational [[communications satellite]], dock at the target satellite’s [[Apogee kick motor|apogee-kick motor]], remove a small part of the target spacecraft’s thermal protection blanket, connect to a fuel-pressure line and deliver the propellant.  "MDA officials estimate the docking maneuver would take the communications satellite out of service for about 20 minutes."&lt;ref name=sn20100303/&gt;

{{as of|2011|03}}, MDA has secured a major customer for the initial demonstration project.  [[Intelsat]] has agreed to purchase one-half of the {{convert|2000|kg}} propellant payload that the MDA spacecraft would carry into [[geostationary orbit]].  Such a purchase would add somewhere between two and four years of additional service life for up to five Intelsat satellites, assuming 200&amp;nbsp;kg of fuel is delivered to each one.&lt;ref name=sn20110314&gt;
{{cite news |last=de Selding |first=Peter B. |title=Intelsat Signs Up for Satellite Refueling Service |url=http://www.spacenews.com/satellite_telecom/intelsat-signs-for-satellite-refueling-service.html |accessdate=March 15, 2011 |newspaper=Space News |date=March 14, 2011 |quote=''if the MDA spacecraft performs as planned, Intelsat will be paying a total of some $200 million to MDA. This assumes that four or five satellites are given around 200 kilograms each of fuel. ... The maiden flight of the vehicle would be on an International Launch Services Proton rocket, industry officials said. One official said the MDA spacecraft, including its 2,000 kilograms of refueling propellant, is likely to weigh around 6,000 kilograms at launch.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{as of|2010|03}}, the spacecraft could be ready to begin refueling communication satellites by 2015.&lt;ref name=cnw20110315&gt;

The first refueling mission is to be available 3.5 years following the commencement of the build phase. ... The services provided by MDA to Intelsat under this agreement are valued at more than US$280 million.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512175952/http://www.canadanewswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2011/15/c2866.html |archivedate=May 12, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{asof|2013|01}}, no customers have signed up for an MDA refueling mission.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125/&gt;

=== Space tug alternatives to direct refueling ===

[[Competition|Competitive]] design alternatives to in-space [[reaction control system|RCS]] fuel transfer exist.  It is possible to bring additional propellant to a space asset, and utilize the propellant for attitude control or orbital velocity change, without ever [[propellant transfer|transferring]] the propellant to the target space asset.

The [[ViviSat]] [[Mission Extension Vehicle]], also under development since the early 2010s, illustrates one alternative approach that would connect to the target satellite similarly to MDA SIS, via the kick motor, but will not transfer fuel.  Rather, the Mission Extension Vehicle will use "its own thrusters to supply [[attitude control]] for the target."&lt;ref name=av20110321&gt;
{{cite news |last=Morring |first=Frank, Jr. |title=An End To Space Trash? |url=http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story.jsp?id=news/awst/2011/03/21/AW_03_21_2011_p23-297586.xml&amp;headline=An%20End%20to%20Space%20Trash?&amp;channel=awst |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |newspaper=Aviation Week |date=March 22, 2011 |quote=''ViviSat, a new 50-50 joint venture of U.S. Space and ATK, is marketing a satellite-refueling spacecraft that connects to a target spacecraft using the same probe-in-the-kick-motor approach as MDA, but does not transfer its fuel. Instead, the vehicle becomes a new fuel tank, using its own thrusters to supply attitude control for the target. ... [the ViviSat] concept is not as far along as MDA.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ViviSat believes their approach is more simple and can operate at lower cost than the MDA propellant transfer approach, while having the technical ability to dock with and service a greater number (90 percent) of the approximately 450 [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] satellites in orbit.&lt;ref name=av20110321/&gt;
{{asof|2013|01}}, no customers have signed up for a ViviSat-enabled mission extension.&lt;ref name=sfn20130125/&gt;

In 2015, [[Lockheed Martin]] proposed the [[Jupiter (spacecraft)|Jupiter]] [[space tug]].  If built, Jupiter would operate in [[low Earth orbit]] shuttling [[Exoliner|cargo carriers]] to and from the [[International Space Station]], remaining on orbit indefinitely, and refueling itself from subsequent transport ships carrying later cargo carrier modules.&lt;ref name=sn20150313&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9230">'''Radiolocating''' is the process of finding the [[location (geography)|location]] of something through the use of [[radio wave]]s. It generally refers to passive uses, particularly [[radar]]&amp;mdash;as well as detecting buried cables, [[water main]]s, and other [[public utilities]]. It is similar to [[radionavigation]], but radiolocation usually refers to passively finding a distant object rather than actively one's own position. Both are types of [[radiodetermination]]. Radiolocation is also used in [[real-time locating systems]] (RTLS) for tracking valuable assets.

==Basic principles==
An object can be located by measuring the characteristics of received radio waves. The radio waves may be transmitted by the object to be located, or they may be [[backscatter]]ed waves (as in radar or passive [[RFID]]).  A [[stud finder]] uses radiolocation when it uses radio waves rather than [[ultrasound]].

One technique measures a distance by using the difference in the power of the received signal strength (RSSI) as compared to the originating signal strength.  Another technique uses the [[time of arrival]] (TOA), when the time of transmission and speed of propagation are known. Combining TOA data from several receivers at different known locations (time difference of arrival, TDOA) can provide an estimate of position even in the absence of knowledge of the time of transmission. The [[angle of arrival]] (AOA) at a receiving station can be determined by the use of a directional antenna, or by differential time of arrival at an array of antennas with known location. AOA information may be combined with distance estimates from the techniques previously described to establish the location of a transmitter or backscatterer. Alternatively, the AOA at two receiving stations of known location establishes the position of the transmitter. The use of multiple receivers to locate a transmitter is known as [[multilateration]]. 

Estimates are improved when the transmission characteristics of the medium is factored into the calculations. For RSSI this means [[permeability (electromagnetism)|electromagnetic permeability]]; for TOA it may mean [[Non-line-of-sight propagation#How is_positioning accuracy affected by NLOS conditions.3F|non-line-of-sight]] receptions. 

Use of RSSI to locate a transmitter from a single receiver requires that both the transmitted (or backscattered) power from the object to be located are known, and that the propagation characteristics of the intervening region are known. In empty space, signal strength decreases as the [[inverse square]] of the distance for distances large compared to a wavelength and compared to the object to be located, but in most real environments, a number of impairments can occur: absorption, refraction, shadowing, and reflection. Absorption is negligible for radio propagation in air at frequencies less than about 10&amp;nbsp;GHz, but becomes important at multi-GHz frequencies where rotational molecular states can be excited. Refraction is important at long ranges (tens to hundreds of kilometers) due to gradients in moisture content and temperature in the atmosphere. In urban, mountainous, or indoor environments, obstruction by intervening obstacles and reflection from nearby surfaces are very common, and contribute to [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] distortion: that is, reflected and delayed replicates of the transmitted signal are combined at the receiver. Signals from different paths can add constructively or destructively: such variations in amplitude are known as [[fading]]. The dependence of signal strength on position of transmitter and receiver becomes complex and often non-monotonic, making single-receiver estimates of position inaccurate and unreliable. Multilateration using many receivers is often combined with calibration measurements ("fingerprinting") to improve accuracy.

TOA and AOA measurements are also subject to multipath errors, particularly when the direct path from the transmitter to receiver is blocked by an obstacle. Time of arrival measurements are also most accurate when the signal has distinct time-dependent features on the scale of interest—for example, when it is composed of short pulses of known duration—but [[Fourier Transform|Fourier transform]] theory shows that in order to change amplitude or phase on a short time scale, a signal must use a broad bandwidth. For example, to create a pulse of about 1&amp;nbsp;ns duration, roughly sufficient to identify location to within 0.3 m (1&amp;nbsp;foot), a bandwidth of roughly 1&amp;nbsp;GHz is required. In many regions of the radio spectrum, emission over such a broad bandwidth is not allowed by the relevant regulatory authorities, in order to avoid interference with other narrowband users of the spectrum. In the United States, unlicensed transmission is allowed in several bands, such as the 902-928&amp;nbsp;MHz and 2.4-2.483&amp;nbsp;GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical [[ISM band]]s, but high-power transmission cannot extend outside of these bands. However, several jurisdictions now allow [[ultrawideband]] transmission over GHz or multi-GHz bandwidths, with constraints on transmitted power to minimize interference with other spectrum users. UWB pulses can be very narrow in time, and often provide accurate estimates of TOA in urban or indoor environments.

Radiolocation is employed in a wide variety of industrial and military activities. Radar systems often use a combination of TOA and AOA to determine a backscattering object's position using a single receiver. In [[Doppler radar]], the [[Doppler shift]] is also taken into account, determining [[velocity]] rather than location (though it helps determine future location). Real Time Location Systems RTLS using calibrated RTLS, and TDOA, are commercially available. The widely used Global Positioning System ([[GPS]]) is based on TOA of signals from satellites at known positions.

==Mobile phones==
Radiolocation is also used in [[cellular telephony]] via [[base station]]s. Most often, this is done through [[trilateration]] between [[radio masts and towers|radio tower]]s. The location of the [[Caller (telecommunications)|Caller]] or [[handset]] can be determined several ways:
* '''angle of arrival''' ('''AOA''') requires at least two towers, locating the caller at the point where the lines along the angles from each tower [[Line-line intersection|intersect]]
* '''time difference of arrival''' ('''TDOA''') resp. '''time of arrival''' ('''TOA''') works using [[multilateration]], except that it is the networks that determine the time difference and therefore distance from each tower (as with [[seismometer]]s)
* '''location signature''' uses "[[RF fingerprint|fingerprint]]ing" to store and recall [[pattern]]s (such as multipath) which mobile phone signals are known to exhibit at different locations in each cell

The first two depend on a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line-of-sight]], which can be difficult or impossible in [[mountain]]ous [[terrain]] or around [[skyscraper]]s. Location signatures actually work ''better'' in these conditions however. [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] and [[GSM]] networks such as [[Cingular]] and [[T-Mobile]] use TDOA.

[[CDMA]] networks such as [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[Sprint PCS]] tend to use handset-based radiolocation technologies, which are technically more similar to radionavigation. GPS is one of those technologies.

Composite solutions, needing both the handset and the network include:
* [[assisted GPS]] ([[wireless]] or [[Television|TV]]) allows use of GPS even indoors
* [[Advanced Forward Link Trilateration]] ([[A-FLT]])
* [[Timing Advance/Network Measurement Report]] ([[TA/NMR]])
* [[Enhanced Observed Time Difference]] ([[E-OTD]])

Initially, the purpose of any of these in mobile phones is so that the [[public safety answering point]] (PSAP) which answers [[telephone call|call]]s to an [[emergency telephone number]] can know where the caller is and exactly where to send [[emergency services]]. This ability is known within the [[NANP]] ([[North America]]) as wireless [[enhanced 911]]. Mobile phone users may have the option to permit the location information gathered to be sent to other [[phone number]]s or [[data]] networks, so that it can help people who are simply lost or want other [[location-based service]]s. By default, this selection is usually turned off, to protect [[privacy]].

[[File:Female driver buckling seatbelt.jpg|thumb|A woman buckling a three-point seat belt]]

A '''seat belt''' (also known as a '''seatbelt''' or '''safety belt''') is a [[vehicle safety]] device designed to secure the occupant of a [[vehicle]] against harmful movement that may result during a [[collision]] or a sudden stop. A seat belt functions to reduce the likelihood of [[death]] or serious [[injury]] in a [[traffic collision]] by reducing the force of [[Second Impact (safety)|secondary impacts]] with interior strike hazards, by keeping occupants positioned correctly for maximum effectiveness of the [[airbag]] (if equipped) and by preventing occupants being ejected from the vehicle in a crash or if the vehicle rolls over.

When in motion, the driver and passengers are travelling at the same speed as the car. If the driver makes the car suddenly stop or crashes it, the driver and passengers continue at the same speed the car was going before it stopped. A seatbelt applies an opposing force to the driver and passengers to prevent them from falling out or making contact with the interior of the car. Seatbelts are considered Primary Restraint Systems (PRS), because of their vital role in occupant safety.

[[File:Lives Saved by Safety Belts and Air Bags, NHTSA, DOT.svg|thumb|Lives saved by seat belts and airbags in the United States, 1991–2001]]
An analysis conducted in the [[United States]] in 1984 compared a variety of seat belt types alone and in combination with [[Airbag|air bags]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite report|author = National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Plans and Programs, Office of Planning and Analysis|url = http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/806572.pdf|date = 11 July 1984|title = Passenger Car Front Seat Occupant Protection|accessdate = 2016-02-14|page = IV-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of fatality reduction for front seat passengers was broad, from 20% to 55%, as was the range of major injury, from 25% to 60%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; More recently, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] has summarized this data by stating "seat belts reduce serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about half."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Seat Belts: Get the Facts|url = https://www.cdc.gov/Motorvehiclesafety/seatbelts/facts.html|website = Motor Vehicle Safety|access-date = 2016-02-15|publisher = Centers for Disease Control|date = 20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most seatbelt malfunctions are a result of there being too much slack in the seatbelt at the time of the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tragoslaw.com/clearwater-car-accident-lawyer/injuries/|title=Clearwater Car Accident Injuries {{!}} Whiplash Injuries|newspaper=Clearwater Injury Lawyer|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Seat belts were invented by English engineer [[George Cayley]] in the mid-19th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/features/Clunk-click--an-invention.5583475.jp?articlepage=1|title=Clunk, click – an invention that's saved lives for 50 years|author=Manby, Frederic|date=24 August 2009|accessdate=2010-12-04|publisher=Johnston Press Digital Publishing|newspaper=Yorkshire Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Edward J. Claghorn of New York, was granted the first patent ({{US patent|312085}}, on February 10, 1885 for a safety belt).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

|isbn=91-630-9389-8|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claghorn was granted United States Patent #312,085 for a Safety-Belt for tourists, painters, firemen, etc. who are being raised or lowered, described in the patent as "designed to be applied to the person, and provided with hooks and other attachments for securing the person to a fixed object."

In 1946, Dr. C. Hunter Shelden opened a neurological practice at [[Huntington Memorial Hospital]] in [[Pasadena, California]]. In the early 1950s, Dr. Shelden made a major contribution to the automotive industry with his idea of retractable seat belts. This came about his from his care of the high number of head injuries coming through the emergency room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmri.org/HMRI_News/HMRI_News_-_May_2003/Shelden_Memorial/shelden_memorial.html |title=HMRI News |publisher=Hmri.org |accessdate=2011-02-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110226051243/http://www.hmri.org/HMRI_News/HMRI_News_-_May_2003/Shelden_Memorial/shelden_memorial.html |archivedate=February 26, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He investigated the early seat belts whose primitive designs were implicated in these injuries and deaths. To reduce the high level of injuries he was seeing, he proposed, in late 1955, retractable seat belts, recessed [[steering wheel]]s, reinforced roofs, [[roll cage|roll bars]], automatic door locks, and passive restraints such as the [[air bag]].&lt;ref name="JAMA"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prevention, the only cure for head injuries resulting from automobile accidents |author=C.

American car manufacturers [[Nash Motors|Nash]] (in 1949) and Ford (in 1955) offered seat belts as options, while Swedish [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] first introduced seat belts as standard in 1958.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/the-man-who-saved-a-million-lives-nils-bohlin--inventor-of-the-seatbelt-1773844.html |title=The man who saved a million lives: Nils Bohlin - inventor of the seat belt - Features, Gadgets &amp; Tech |publisher=The Independent |date=2009-08-19 |accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Saab GT750|Saab GT 750]] was introduced at the New York Motor Show in 1958 with safety belts fitted as standard, the practice became commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trollhattansaab.net/page/5 |title=Trollhattan Saab—Saab 9-1, 9-3, 9-4x, 9-5, 9-7x News |publisher=Trollhattansaab.net |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Glenn Sheren, of Mason, Michigan, submitted a patent application on March 31, 1955 for an automotive seat belt and was awarded US Patent 2,855,215 in 1958. This was a continuation of an earlier patent application that Mr. Sheren had filed on September 22, 1952.&lt;ref name="www.freepatentsonline.com" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/2855215.html |title=Automobile safety belt system - Patent 2855215 |publisher=Freepatentsonline.com |date=1958-10-07 |accessdate=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first modern three point seat belt (the so-called ''CIR-Griswold restraint'') used in most consumer vehicles today was patented in 1955 {{US patent|2,710,649}} by the Americans Roger W. Griswold and [[Hugh DeHaven]].

The Swedish [[Vattenfall|national electric utility]], did a study of all fatal, on-the-job accidents among their employees. The study revealed that the majority of fatalities occurred while the employees were on the road on company business. In response, two Vattenfall safety engineers, Bengt Odelgard and Per-Olof Weman, started to develop a seat belt. Their work was presented to Swedish manufacturer [[Volvo]] in the late 1950s, and set the standard for seat belts in Swedish cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In addition to designing an effective three-point belt, Bohlin demonstrated its effectiveness in a study of 28,000 accidents in Sweden. Unbelted occupants sustained fatal injuries throughout the whole speed scale, whereas none of the belted occupants were fatally injured at accident speeds below 60&amp;nbsp;mph. No belted occupant was fatally injured if the passenger compartment remained intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The world's first seat belt law was put in place in 1970, in the state of [[Victoria, Australia]], making the wearing of a seat belt compulsory for drivers and front-seat passengers. This legislation was enacted after trialing Hemco seatbelts, designed by Desmond Hemphill (1926–2001), in the front seats of police vehicles, lowering the incidence of officer injury and death.&lt;ref name="drivers-tech"&gt;{{cite web

==Types==
===Two-point===
A 2-point belt attaches at its two endpoints, and was invented in the early 1900s by [[Jack Swearingen]] of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Lap====
[[File:Airplane seat belt 1.jpg|thumb|A lap ("2-point") belt in an airplane]]
A lap belt is a strap that goes over the waist. This was the most commonly installed type of belt prior to legislation requiring three-point belts, and is primarily found in older cars. [[coach (bus)|Coaches]] are equipped with lap belts (although many newer coaches have three-point belts), as are passenger aircraft seats.

University of Minnesota Professor James J. (Crash) Ryan was the inventor of and held the patent on the automatic retractable lap safety belt. [[Ralph Nader]] cited Ryan's work in [[Unsafe at Any Speed]] and in 1966 President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] signed two bills requiring safety belts in all passenger vehicles starting in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;''SEE''"Crash" Was His Name; Car Safety Was His Game" in Minnesota Medicine http://www.minnesotamedicine.com/Past-Issues/Past-Issues-2006/May-2006/Pulse-Crash-May-2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1980s, three-point belts were commonly available only in the front outboard seats of cars; the back seats were only often fitted with lap belts. Evidence of the potential of lap belts to cause separation of the [[lumbar vertebrae]] and the sometimes associated [[paralysis]], or "[[seat belt syndrome]]", led to progressive revision of passenger safety regulations in nearly all developed countries to require three-point belts first in all outboard seating positions and eventually in all seating positions in passenger vehicles. Since September 1, 2007, all new cars sold in the U.S. require a lap and shoulder belt in the center rear seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/Anton_FRNov16.html |title=Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection. Final Rule |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Besides regulatory changes, "seat belt syndrome" has led to tremendous [[legal liability|liability]] for vehicle manufacturers. One Los Angeles case resulted in a $45 million jury verdict against the [[Ford Motor Company]]; the resulting $30 million judgment (after deductions for another defendant who settled prior to trial) was affirmed on appeal in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Karlsson v. Ford Motor Co.'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/CA4/140CA4t1202.htm 140 Cal. App. 4th 1202] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sash====
[[File:Seat belt BX.jpg|thumb|upright|A seat belt and buckle]]
A "sash" or shoulder harness is a strap that goes diagonally over the vehicle occupant's outboard shoulder and is buckled inboard of his or her lap. The shoulder harness may attach to the lap belt tongue, or it may have a tongue and buckle completely separate from those of the lap belt. Shoulder harnesses of this separate or semi-separate type were installed in conjunction with lap belts in the outboard front seating positions of many vehicles in the North American market starting at the inception of the shoulder belt requirement of the U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]'s Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 on 1 January 1968. However, if the shoulder strap is used without the lap belt, the vehicle occupant is likely to "submarine", or slide forward in the seat and out from under the belt, in a frontal collision. In the mid-1970s, three-point belt systems such as [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler's]] "Uni-Belt" began to supplant the separate lap and shoulder belts in American-made cars, though such three-point belts had already been supplied in European vehicles such as [[Volvo]]s, [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]s for some years.

===Three-point===
[[File:Seatbelt.jpg|thumb|upright|A three-point seat belt]]
A three-point belt is a '''Y'''-shaped arrangement, similar to the separate lap and sash belts, but unitized. Like the separate lap-and-sash belt, in a collision the three-point belt spreads out the energy of the moving body over the chest, pelvis, and shoulders. Volvo introduced the first production three-point belt in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/press/releases/2007/20_years_air_bags.shtml |title=Volvo Cars airbag celebrates 20 years |publisher=Volvoclub.org.uk |date=2007-05-26 |accessdate=2009-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first car with a three-point belt was a [[Volvo PV444/544|Volvo PV 544]] that was delivered to a dealer in Kristianstad on August 13, 1959. However, the first car model to feature the three-point seat belt as a standard item was the 1959 [[Volvo 122]], first outfitted with a two-point belt at initial delivery in 1958, replaced with the three-point seat belt the following year.&lt;ref name=VolvoLindh&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three-point belt was developed by [[Nils Bohlin]] who had earlier also worked on [[ejection seat]]s at [[Saab Group|Saab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alltommotor.se/artiklar/nyheter/trepunktsbaltet-50-ar-1.14639 |title=Allt om Motor: Trepunktsbältet 50 år |publisher=Alltommotor.se |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volvo then made the new seat belt design patent open in the interest of safety and made it available to other car manufacturers for free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/three-point-seatbelt-inventor-nils-bohlin-born Three-point seatbelt inventor Nils Bohlin born], History Channel&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2009/08/11/473711.html Volvo's Three-Point Safety Belt Celebrates 50 Years of Saving Lives], The Auto Channel&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belt-in-Seat (BIS)====
The BIS is a three-point harness with the shoulder belt attached to the seat itself, rather than to the vehicle structure. The first car using this system was the [[Range Rover Classic]]. Fitment was standard on the front seats from 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lankard |first=Tom |url=http://editorial.autos.msn.com/article.aspx?cp-documentid=434695 |title='&amp;#39;The first seat offered in the U.S. that incorporated a three-point belt—on the 1990 Mercedes-Benz SL—'&amp;#39; |publisher=Editorial.autos.msn.com |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cars like the [[Renault Vel Satis]] use this system for the front seats. A General Motors assessment concluded seat-mounted three-point belts offer better protection especially to smaller vehicle occupants,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080612131300/http://www.khou.com/news/upclose/stories/khou030630_ds_UpCloseConsumerSafetybelts.44b60c63.html "Up Close: Seatbelt safety in question"]— KHOU News, 20 June 2003 {{Dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though GM did not find a safety performance improvement in vehicles with seat-mounted belts versus belts mounted to the vehicle body.&lt;ref name=MSN&gt;{{cite web

BIS type belts have been used by automakers in convertibles and pillarless hardtops, where there is no "B" pillar to affix the upper mount of the belt. Chrysler and Cadillac are well known for using this design. Antique auto enthusiasts sometimes replace original seats in their cars with BIS-equipped front seats, providing a measure of safety not available when these cars were new. However, modern BIS systems typically use electronics that must be installed and connected with the seats and the vehicle's electrical system in order to function properly.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

===4-, 5-, and 6-point===
[[File:Bucket seat with Schroth six-point harness in a 2010 Porsche 997 GT3 RS 3.8.jpg|thumb|[[Bucket seat]] combined with a Schroth 6-point harness]]
[[Five-Point Harness|Five-point harnesses]] are typically found in [[child safety seat]]s and in [[automobile racing|racing]] cars. The lap portion is connected to a belt between the [[human leg|leg]]s and there are two shoulder belts, making a total of five points of attachment to the seat. A 4-point harness is similar, but without the strap between the legs, while a 6-point harness has two belts between the legs. In [[NASCAR]], the 6-point harness became popular after the [[death of Dale Earnhardt]], who was wearing a five-point harness when he suffered his fatal crash; as it was first thought that his belt had broken, and broke his neck at impact, some teams ordered a six-point harness in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/nascar/cup/columns/story?columnist=hinton_ed&amp;id=6116145 |title=Earnhardt's death a watershed moment |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seven-point===
[[Aerobatic]] [[aircraft]] frequently use a combination harness consisting of a five-point harness with a redundant lap-belt attached to a different part of the aircraft. While providing redundancy for negative-g manoeuvres (which lift the pilot out of the seat); they also require the pilot to un-latch two harnesses if it is necessary to parachute from a failed aircraft.

==Technology==
[[File:Intertial-reel.jpg|thumb|upright|Seat belt with uncovered inertial reel]]

===Locking retractors===
The purpose of locking retractors is to provide the seated occupant the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement in the event of a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called "retractors" equipped with [[inertia]]l locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat belt lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a [[centrifugal clutch]] activated by rapid acceleration of the strap (webbing) from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.

A vehicle-sensitive lock is based on a [[pendulum]] swung away from its plumb position by rapid deceleration or rollover of the vehicle. In the absence of rapid deceleration or rollover, the reel is unlocked and the belt strap may be pulled from the reel against the spring tension of the reel. The vehicle occupant can move around with relative freedom while the spring tension of the reel keeps the belt taut against the occupant. When the pendulum swings away from its normal plumb position due to sudden deceleration or rollover, a [[Ratchet (device)|pawl]] is engaged, the reel locks and the strap restrains the belted occupant in position. Dual-sensing locking retractors use both vehicle G-loading and webbing payout rate to initiate the locking mechanism.

===Pretensioners and webclamps===
[[File:Gurtstraffer.gif|thumb|Pyrotechnic pretensioner diagram]]

Seatbelts in many newer vehicles are also equipped with "pretensioners" or "web clamps", or both.

Pretensioners preemptively tighten the belt to prevent the occupant from jerking forward in a crash. Mercedes-Benz first introduced pretensioners on the [[Mercedes-Benz W126|1981 S-Class]]. In the event of a crash, a pretensioner will tighten the belt almost instantaneously. This reduces the motion of the occupant in a violent crash. Like airbags, pretensioners are triggered by sensors in the car's body, and many pretensioners have used explosively expanding gas to drive a piston that retracts the belt. Pretensioners also lower the risk of "submarining", which occurs when a passenger slides forward under a loosely fitted seat belt.

Some systems also pre-emptively tighten the belt during fast accelerations and strong decelerations, even if no crash has happened. This has the advantage that it may help prevent the driver from sliding out of position during violent evasive maneuvers, which could cause loss of control of the vehicle. These pre-emptive safety systems may ''prevent'' some collisions from happening, as well as reducing injury in the event an actual collision occurs.&lt;ref name=Ito&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ito|first1=Daisuke|last2=Ejima|first2=Susumu|last3=Sukegawa|first3=Yoshihiro|last4=Antona|first4=Jacobo|last5=Ito|first5=Hisao|title=Assessment of a Pre-Crash Technology in Frontal Impacts by Using a New Crash Test Sled System with Controllable Pre-Impact Braking|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv23/23ESV-000274.PDF|website=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|publisher=National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=2014-06-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140506213001/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv23/23ESV-000274.PDF|archivedate=2014-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-emptive systems generally use electric pretensioners which can operate repeatedly and for a sustained period, rather than pyrotechnic pretensioners, which can only operate a single time.

Webclamps clamp the webbing in the event of an accident, and limit the distance the webbing can spool out (caused by the unused webbing tightening on the central drum of the mechanism). These belts also often incorporate an energy management loop ("rip stitching") in which a section of the webbing is looped and stitched with a special stitching. The function of this is to "rip" at a predetermined load, which reduces the maximum force transmitted through the belt to the occupant during a violent collision, reducing injuries to the occupant.

A study demonstrated that standard automotive three-point restraints fitted with pyrotechnic or electric pretensioners were not able to eliminate all interior passenger compartment head strikes in rollover test conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lapbeltcinch.net/media/CG-Lock/Special-Materials/Ford-Rollover-Paper.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 2007-01-0709.doc |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-09-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408075531/http://lapbeltcinch.net/media/CG-Lock/Special-Materials/Ford-Rollover-Paper.pdf |archive-date=2013-04-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Electric pretensioners are often incorporated on vehicles equipped with [[precrash system]]s; they are designed to reduce seat belt slack in a potential collision and assist in placing the occupants in a more optimal seating position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoliv.com/ProductsAndInnovations/PassiveSafetySystems/Pages/Seatbelts/ActiveSeatbelts.aspx |title=Active Seatbelts |publisher=Autoliv.com |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric pretensioners also can operate on a repeated or sustained basis, providing better protection in the event of an extended rollover or a [[multiple-vehicle collision|multiple collision]] accident.

===Inflatable===
The inflatable seatbelt was invented by Donald Lewis and tested at the Automotive Products Division of [[Allied Chemical Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|3841654}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inflatable seatbelts have tubular inflatable bladders contained within an outer cover. When a crash occurs the bladder inflates with a gas to increase the area of the restraint contacting the occupant and also shortening the length of the restraint to tighten the belt around the occupant, improving the protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Automatic===
[[File:1990 Honda Civic DX interior.JPG|thumb|Automatic seat belt in a [[Honda Civic]]]]

Seatbelts that automatically move into position around a vehicle occupant once the adjacent door is closed and/or the engine is started were developed as a countermeasure against low usage rates of manual seat belts, particularly in the [[United States]].

The 1972 [[Volkswagen]] ESVW1 [[Experimental Safety Vehicle]] presented passive seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicvw.org/gallery2/main.php?g2_view=core.ShowItem&amp;g2_itemId=5498 |title=Experimental Safety Vehicle |publisher=Classicvw.org |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Volvo Cars|Volvo]] tried to develop a passive three point seatbelt. In 1973, Volkswagen announced they had a functional passive seat belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://safetysells.org/chapter3.pdf |title=Safety Sells: Chapter 3 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first commercial car to use automatic seat belts was the 1975 [[Volkswagen Golf]].&lt;ref name="passive"&gt;{{cite news| title=Passive-Belt Activity |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1978-03-26 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic seat belts received a boost in the United States in 1977 when [[Brock Adams]], [[United States Secretary of Transportation]] in the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]], mandated that by 1983 every new car should have either airbags or automatic seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Airbags, seat belts to be mandatory in every car by 1983| newspaper=Daily Collegian |location=Penn State |date=1977-07-01| url= http://digitalnewspapers.libraries.psu.edu/Default/Skins/BasicArch/Client.asp?Skin=BasicArch&amp;&amp;AppName=2&amp;enter=true&amp;BaseHref=DCG/1977/07/01&amp;EntityId=Ar00800 |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Air Bags, Automatic Seat Belts |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=1977-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was strong lobbying against the passive restraint requirement by the auto industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Stevens |first=William K. |title=Auto Industry Expresses Reluctance, Resignation Over Air Bag Mandate | newspaper=The New York Times |page=18 |date=1977-07-01| url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0A1FF9355D167493C3A9178CD85F438785F9 | accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was criticized by [[Ralph Nader]], who said that the 1983 deadline was too late.&lt;ref name="crusade"/&gt; The VW Rabbit also offered this safety feature.&lt;ref name="crusade"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haic |first=Marty |title=Crusade Continues, But The Intensity Has Mellowed | newspaper=Boca Raton News |page=8C |date=1979-02-23 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Kc0PAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N40DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6914,4536924&amp;dq=automatic-seat-belts&amp;hl=en | accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1978, Volkswagen had reported 90,000 Rabbits sold with automatic seat belts.&lt;ref name="passive"/&gt; 
General Motors introduced a three-point non-motorized passive belt system in 1980 to comply with the passive restraint requirement.&lt;ref name="TRB-48"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Buckling Up: Technologies to Increase Seat Belt Use |year=2004 |page=48 |url= http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/sr/sr278.pdf |publisher=Transportation Research Board |accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was used as an active lap-shoulder belt because of unlatching the belt to exit the vehicle.&lt;ref name="TRB-48"/&gt; Despite this common practice, field studies of belt use still showed an increase in wearing rates with this door-mounted system.&lt;ref name="TRB-48"/&gt; [[General Motors]] began offering automatic seat belts on the [[Chevrolet Chevette]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=GM Offers Automatic Seat Belts | newspaper=Chicago Tribune |page=8 |date=1978-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GM's Automatic Seat Belts Go on Chevettes |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=1978-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the company reported disappointing sales because of this feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sales of Automatic Seat Belts Disappointing, Chevrolet Says | newspaper=Toledo Blade |page=1 |date=1979-02-23 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vAoVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5703,3431567&amp;dq=automatic-seat-belts&amp;hl=en |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study released in 1978 by the [[United States Department of Transportation]] claimed that cars with automatic seat belts had a fatality rate of .78 per 100 million miles, compared with 2.34 for cars with regular, manual belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Girard |first=Penny |title=Study Finds Automatic Seat Belts, Airbags Save Lives |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |page=1 |date=1978-08-31 |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vAoVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hwIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5703,3431567&amp;dq=automatic-seat-belts&amp;hl=en |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When driver side [[airbags]] became mandatory on all passenger vehicles in model year 1995, most manufacturers stopped equipping cars with automatic seat belts. Exceptions include the 1995–96 [[Ford Escort (North American)|Ford Escort]]/[[Mercury Tracer]] and the [[Eagle Summit|Eagle Summit Wagon]], which had automatic safety belts along with dual airbags.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

====Systems====
* '''Manual lap belt with automatic motorized shoulder belt'''—When the door is opened, the shoulder belt moves from a fixed point near the seat back on a track mounted in the door frame of the car to a point at the other end of the track near the windshield. Once the door is closed and the car is started, the belt moves rearward along the track to its original position, thus securing the passenger. The lap belt must be fastened manually.
* '''Manual lap belt with automatic non-motorized shoulder belt'''—This system was used in American-market vehicles such as the [[Hyundai Excel]] and [[Volkswagen Jetta]]. The shoulder belt is fixed to the aft upper corner of the vehicle door, and is not motorized. The lap belt must be fastened manually.
* '''Automatic shoulder and lap belts'''—This system was mainly used in [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] vehicles, though it was also used on some [[Honda Civic]] hatchbacks and [[Nissan Sentra]] coupés. When the door is opened, the belts go from a fixed point in the middle of the car by the floor to retractors on the door. Passengers must slide into the car under the belts. When the door closes, the seat belt retracts into the door. The belts have normal release buttons that are supposed to be used only in an emergency, but in practice are routinely used in the same manner as manual seat belt clasps. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} This system also found use by [[American Specialty Cars]] when they created the 1991-1994 [[convertible]] special edition of the [[Nissan 240SX]], a car that traditionally had a motorized shoulder belt.

====Disadvantages====
Automatic belt systems generally offer inferior occupant crash protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| agency=Associated Press | title=Chrysler Doubts Air-Bag Claims | date=1977-09-30 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=apAjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bKEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=896,3611827&amp;hl=en | work =The Montreal Gazette | accessdate=2010-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abeles"&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Ability of Automakers to Introduce a Costly, Regulated New Technology: A Case Study of Automotive Airbags in the U.S. Light-Duty Vehicle Market | journal=Master's Thesis | year=1998 | first=Ethan | last=Abeles | id= | url=http://pubs.its.ucdavis.edu/publication_detail.php?id=175 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612195455/http://pubs.its.ucdavis.edu/publication_detail.php?id=175 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2010-06-12 | accessdate=2010-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In systems with belts attached to the door rather than a sturdier fixed portion of the vehicle body, a crash that causes the vehicle door to open leaves the occupant without belt protection. In such a scenario, the occupant may be thrown from the vehicle and suffer greater injury or death.&lt;ref name=Abeles/&gt;

Because many automatic belt system designs compliant with the US passive-restraint mandate did not meet the safety performance requirements of [[Canada]]—which were not weakened to accommodate automatic belts—vehicle models which had been eligible for easy importation in either direction across the US-Canada border when equipped with manual belts became ineligible for importation in either direction once the U.S. variants obtained automatic belts and the Canadian versions retained manual belts. Two particular models included the [[Dodge Spirit]] and [[Plymouth Acclaim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.riv.ca/english/html/how_to_import.html |title=Canadian vehicle importation regulations |publisher=Riv.ca |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FMVSS/#SN101 |title=US vehicle importation regulations |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatic belt systems also present several operational disadvantages. Motorists who would normally wear seat belts must still fasten the manual lap belt, thus rendering redundant the automation of the shoulder belt. Those who do not fasten the lap belt wind up inadequately protected only by the shoulder belt; in a crash without a lap belt such a vehicle occupant is likely to "submarine" (be thrown forward under the shoulder belt) and be seriously injured. Motorized or door-affixed shoulder belts hinder access to the vehicle, making it difficult to enter and exit—particularly if the occupant is carrying items such as a box or a purse. Vehicle owners tend to disconnect the motorized or door-affixed shoulder belt to relieve the nuisance of entering and exiting the vehicle, leaving only a lap belt for crash protection. Also, many automatic seat belt systems are incompatible with child safety seats, or only compatible with special modifications.

== Homologation and testing ==
Starting in 1971 and ending in 1972, the United States conducted a research project on seat belt effectiveness on a total of 40,000 vehicle occupants using car accident reports collected during that time. Of these 40,000 occupants, 18% were reported wearing lap belts, or two-point safety belts, 2% were reported wearing a three-point safety belt, and the remaining 80% were reported as wearing no safety belt. The results concluded that users of the two-point lap belt had a 73% lower fatality rate, a 53% lower serious injury rate, and a 38% lower injury rate than the occupants that were reported unrestrained. Similarly, users of the three-point safety belt had a 60% lower serious injury rate and a 41% lower rate of all other injuries. Out of the 2% described as wearing a three-point safety belt, no fatalities were reported.&lt;ref name="roadsafetyobservatory1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Road Safety Observatory|url=http://www.roadsafetyobservatory.com/HowEffective/vehicles/seat-belts|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This study and others led to the Restraint Systems Evaluation Program (RSEP), started by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] in 1975 to increase the reliability and authenticity of past studies. A study as part of this program used data taken from 15,000 tow-away accidents that involved only car models made between 1973 and 1975. The study found that for injuries considered “moderate” or worse, individuals wearing a three-point safety belt had a 56.5% lower injury rate than those wearing no safety belt. The study also concluded that the effectiveness of the safety belt did not differ with size of car.&lt;ref name="roadsafetyobservatory1"/&gt; It was determined that the variation among results of the many studies conducted in the 1960s and 70s was due to the use of different methodologies, and could not be attributed to any significant variation in the effectiveness of safety belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=L.S.|title=Estimates of Motor Vehicle Seat Belt Effectiveness and Use: Implications for Occupant Crash Protection|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=1976|volume=66|issue=9|pages=859–864|doi=10.2105/ajph.66.9.859|pmc=1653464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wayne State University]]’s Automotive Safety Research Group, as well as other researchers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Automotive Safety Research Group-Office of the Vice President for Research- Division of Research|url=http://research.wayne.edu/about/Auto_Safety_Research.php|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; are testing ways to improve seat belt effectiveness and general vehicle safety apparatuses. Wayne State’s Bioengineering Center uses human [[cadavers]] in their crash test research. The Center’s director, Albert King, wrote in 1995 that the vehicle safety improvements made possible since 1987 by the use of cadavers in research had saved nearly 8,500 lives each year, and indicated that improvements made to three-point safety belts save an average of 61 lives every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roach|first1=Mary|title=Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers|date=2003|publisher=New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co.|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New Car Assessment Program]] (NCAP) was put in place by the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 1979. The NCAP is a government program that evaluates vehicle safety designs and sets standards for foreign and domestic automobile companies. The agency developed a rating system and requires access to safety test results. {{As of|2007|09}}, manufacturers are required to place a NCAP star rating on the automobile price sticker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Car Assessment Program (NCAP)|url=https://federalregister.gov/a/2013-07766|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In rear seats==
{{expand section|date=June 2014}}
In 1955 (as a 1956 package), [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] offered lap only seat belts in the rear seats as an option within the [[Lifeguard (automobile safety)|''Lifeguard'']] safety package. In 1967, Volvo started to install lap belts in the rear seats. In 1972, Volvo upgraded the rear seat belts to a three-point belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.volvocars.com/intl/corporation/Safety/Pages/SafetyFirst.aspx Volvocars corporate website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503212254/http://www.volvocars.com/intl/corporation/Safety/Pages/SafetyFirst.aspx |date=May 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child occupants==
{{Main|Infant car seat}}

As with adult drivers and passengers, the advent of seat belts was accompanied by calls for their use by child occupants, including legislation requiring such use. Generally children using adult seat belts suffer significantly lower injury risk when compared to non-buckled children.

The UK extended compulsory seatbelt wearing to child passengers under the age of 14 in 1989. It was observed that this measure was accompanied by a 10% ''increase'' in fatalities and a 12% ''increase'' in injuries among the target population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Risk |last=Adams |first=John |year=1995 |publisher=UCL Press Ltd. University College |location=London |isbn=1-85728-068-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In crashes, small children who wear adult seatbelts can suffer "seat-belt syndrome" injuries including severed intestines, ruptured diaphragms and spinal damage. There is also research suggesting that children in inappropriate restraints are at significantly increased risk of head injury,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Winston FK, Durbin DR, Kallan MJ, Moll EK |title=The danger of premature graduation to seat belts for young children |journal=Pediatrics |volume=105 |issue=6 |pages=1179–83 |date=June 2000 |pmid=10835054 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10835054 |doi=10.1542/peds.105.6.1179|last2=Durbin |last3=Kallan |last4=Moll }}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the authors of this research has been quoted as claiming that: "The early graduation of kids into adult lap and shoulder belts is a leading cause of child-occupant injuries and deaths."&lt;ref&gt;"Kids at Risk: When Seatbelts are NOT Enough", by Karp H, ''Reader's Digest'' (US Edition), November 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of such findings, many jurisdictions now advocate or require child passengers to use specially designed child restraints. Such systems include separate child-sized seats with their own restraints and booster cushions for children using adult restraints. In some jurisdictions children below a certain size are forbidden to travel in front car seats."&lt;ref&gt;Road Amendment (Isabelle Broadhead Child Restraint Measures) Rules 2010. No. 46.

==Reminder chime and light==
[[File:11 ceintures.jpg|thumb|Examples of warning lights on a car dashboard.]]

In Europe, the US, and some other parts of the world, most modern cars include a seat-belt reminder light for the driver and some also include a reminder for the passenger, when present, activated by a pressure sensor under the passenger seat. Some cars will intermittently flash the reminder light and sound the chime until the driver (and sometimes the front passenger, if present) fasten their seatbelts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Seat Belts Technology - RoSPA|url = http://www.rospa.com/road-safety/advice/vehicles/in-car-safety-and-crashworthiness/seat-belts-technology/#SBR|website = www.rospa.com|access-date = 2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, in Sweden, 70% of all cars that were newly registered were equipped with seat belt reminders for the driver.&lt;ref&gt;
http://etsc.eu/wp-content/uploads/ETSC_Seat_belt_reminder_oct_06.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;
Since November 2014, seat belt reminders are mandatory for the driver's seat on new cars sold in Europe.&lt;ref name="brake.org.uk"&gt;http://www.brake.org.uk/facts-resources/1631-seat-belt-reminders&lt;/ref&gt;

Two specifications define the standard of seat belt reminder: UN Regulation 16, Section 8.4 and the Euro NCAP assessment protocol (Euro NCAP, 2013).&lt;ref name="brake.org.uk"/&gt;

In North America, cars sold since the early 1970s{{vague|date=August 2015}} have included an audiovisual reminder system consisting of a [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tale light]] on the dashboard and a buzzer or chime reminding the driver and passengers to fasten their belts. Originally, these lights were accompanied by a warning buzzer whenever the transmission was in any position except park{{clarify|date=August 2016}} if either the driver was not buckled up or, as determined by a pressure sensor in the passenger's seat, if there was a passenger there not buckled up.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} However, this was considered by many to be a major annoyance, as the light would be on and the buzzer would sound continuously if front-seat passengers were not buckled up. Therefore, people who did not wish to buckle up would defeat this system by fastening the seat belts with the seat empty and leaving them that way.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

To combat this dangerous habit, in 1971{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} NHTSA amended [[FMVSS 208|Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard № 208]] (FMVSS 208) to require a seat belt/starter interlock system to prevent passenger cars from being started with an unbelted front-seat occupant. This mandate applied to passenger cars built after August 1973, i.e., starting with the 1974 [[model year]]. The specifications required the system to permit the car to be started only if the belt of an occupied seat were fastened after the occupant sat down, so pre-buckling the belts would not defeat the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xXtmlSHtIQ|title=Chrysler Master Technician Service Conference Session - 1974, Volume 74-1 Seat Belt Starter Interlock|date=6 April 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Federal"&gt;''Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards; Occupant Crash Protection''.

The interlock systems used logic modules complex enough to require special diagnostic computers, and were not entirely dependable—an override button was provided under the hood of equipped cars, permitting one (but only one) "free" starting attempt each time it was pressed.&lt;ref name='Petersen'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Petersen Publishing | title = The Petersen Automotive Troubleshooting &amp; Repair Manual | chapter = Restraint Systems | editors = Erwin M. Rosen | publisher = Grosset &amp; Dunlap | year = 1975 | location = New York, NY | pages = 373–4 | isbn = 0-448-11946-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the interlock system spurred severe backlash from an American public who largely rejected seat belts. In 1974, Congress acted to prohibit NHTSA from requiring or permitting a system that prevents a vehicle from starting or operating with an unbelted occupant, or that gives an audible warning of an unfastened belt for more than 8 seconds after the ignition is turned on.&lt;ref name=Federal/&gt; This prohibition took effect on 27 October 1974, shortly after the 1975 model year began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title49/html/USCODE-2013-title49-subtitleVI-partA-chap301-subchapII-sec30124.htm|title=U.S.C. 30124 - TRANSPORTATION|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the Congressional action, NHTSA once again amended FMVSS 208, requiring vehicles to come with a seat belt reminder system that gives an audible signal for 4 to 8 seconds and a warning light for at least 60 seconds after the ignition is turned on if the driver's seat belt is not fastened.&lt;ref name="Federal" /&gt; This is called a '''seat belt reminder''' (SBR) system. In the mid-1990s, an insurance company from Sweden called Folksam worked with Saab and Ford to determine the requirements for the most efficient seat belt reminder. One characteristic of the optimal SBR, according to the research, is that the audible warning becomes increasingly penetrating the longer the seat belt remains unfastened.&lt;ref name="SWOV"&gt;''SWOV Fact sheet''. (2014). Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://www.swov.nl/rapport/Factsheets/UK/FS_Seatbelt_reminders.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617081622/http://www.swov.nl/rapport/Factsheets/UK/FS_Seatbelt_reminders.pdf |archivedate=2015-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Transportation Research Board Committee, chaired by two psychologists, reported that ESBRs could save an additional 1,000 lives a year.&lt;ref name="Buckle"&gt;Dingfelder, S. F. (2003). Your car says: ‘buckle up’. ''Monitor on Psychology''. ''34''(11). Retrieved from http://www.apa.org/monitor/dec03/seatbelt.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Research by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that Ford's ESBR, which provides an intermittent chime for up to five minutes if the driver is unbelted, sounding for 6 seconds then pausing for 30, increased seat belt use by 5 percentage points.&lt;ref name="Buckle" /&gt; Farmer and Wells found that driver fatality rates were 6% lower for vehicles with ESBR compared with otherwise-identical vehicles without.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Farmer C.

=== Efficacy ===
In 2001, Congress directed NHSTA to study the benefits of technology meant to increase the use of seat belts. NHSTA found that seat belt usage had increased to 73% since the initial introduction of the SBR system.&lt;ref name="Federal" /&gt; In 2002, Ford demonstrated that seat belts were used more in Fords with seat belt reminders than in those without: 76% and 71% respectively. In 2007, Honda conducted a similar study and found that 90% of people who drove Hondas with seat belt reminders used a seat belt, while 84% of people who drove Hondas without seat belt reminders used a seat belt.&lt;ref name="SWOV" /&gt;

This has led many countries to adopt mandatory seat belt wearing laws. It is generally accepted that, in comparing like-for-like accidents, a vehicle occupant not wearing a properly fitted seat belt has a significantly and substantially higher chance of death and serious injury. One large observation studying using US data showed that the [[odds ratio]] of crash death is 0.46 with a three-point belt, when compared with no belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bédard M, Guyatt GH, Stones MJ, Hirdes JP |title=The independent contribution of driver, crash, and vehicle characteristics to driver fatalities |journal=[[Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention]] |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=717–27 |year=2002 |pmid=12371777| doi = 10.1016/S0001-4575(01)00072-0|last2=Guyatt |last3=Stones |last4=Hirdes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study that examined injuries presenting to the [[emergency room|ER]] pre- and post-seat belt law introduction, it was found that 40% more escaped injury and 35% more escaped mild and moderate injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Thomas J |title=Road traffic accidents before and after seatbelt legislation--study in a district general hospital |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=79–81 |year=1990 |pmid=2319551 |doi= |pmc=1292501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of seat belt laws are disputed by those who observe that their passage did not reduce road fatalities. There was also concern that instead of legislating for a general protection standard for vehicle occupants, laws that required a particular technical approach would rapidly become dated as motor manufacturers would tool up for a particular standard which could not easily be changed. For example, in 1969 there were competing designs for lap and three-point seat belts, rapidly tilting seats, and airbags being developed. But as countries started to mandate seat belt restraints the global auto industry invested in the tooling and standardized exclusively on seat belts, and ignored other restraint designs such as air bags for several decades&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| publisher = The Times | date = 1969-01-24 | title = Safety Design | first = John | last = Fenton }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016, seat belt laws can be divided into two categories: primary and secondary. A primary seat belt law allows an officer to issue a citation for lack of seatbelt use without any other citation, whereas a secondary seat belt law allows an officer to issue a seat belt citation only in the presence of a different violation. In the United States, fifteen states enforce secondary laws, while 34 states, as well as the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, enforce primary seat belt laws. New Hampshire lacks both a primary and secondary seat belt law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = State Seat Belt Laws|url = http://www.ghsa.org/html/stateinfo/laws/seatbelt_laws.html|website = www.ghsa.org|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk compensation===
Some have proposed that the number of deaths was influenced by the development of [[risk compensation]], which says that drivers adjust their behavior in response to the increased sense of personal safety wearing a seat belt provides.

In one trial subjects were asked to drive [[go-kart]]s around a track under various conditions. It was found that subjects who started driving unbelted drove consistently faster when subsequently belted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Streff FM, Geller ES |title=An experimental test of risk compensation: between-subject versus within-subject analyses |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=277–87 |year=1988 |pmid=3415759| doi = 10.1016/0001-4575(88)90055-3|last2=Geller |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/27199/1/0000202.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study of habitual non-seatbelt wearers driving in freeway conditions found evidence that they had adapted to seatbelt use by adopting higher driving speeds and closer following distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Janssen W |title=Seat-belt wearing and driving behavior: an instrumented-vehicle study |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=249–61 |year=1994 |pmid=8198694| doi = 10.1016/0001-4575(94)90095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A 2001 analysis of US crash data aimed to establish the effects of seatbelt legislation on driving fatalities&lt;ref name=CohenLeinav&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/papers/pdf/341.pdf |title='The Effects of Mandatory Seat Belt Laws on Driving Behavior and Traffic Fatalities' by Alma Cohen and Liran Einav at Harvard Law School |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that previous estimates of seatbelts effectiveness had been significantly overstated. According to the analysis used, seatbelts were claimed to have decreased fatalities by 1.35% for each 10% increase in seatbelt use. The study controlled for endogenous motivations of seat belt use, which it is claimed creates an artificial correlation between seat belt use and fatalities, leading to the conclusion that seatbelts cause fatalities. For example, drivers in high risk areas are more likely to use seat belts, and are more likely to be in accidents, creating a non-causal correlation between seatbelt use and mortality. After accounting for the endogeneity of seatbelt usage, Cohen and Einav found no evidence that the risk compensation effect makes seatbelt wearing drivers more dangerous, a finding at variance with other research.

===Increased traffic===
Other statistical analyses have included adjustments for factors such as increased traffic, and other factors such as age, and based on these adjustments, a reduction of morbidity and mortality due to seat belt use has been claimed.&lt;ref name=nakahara/&gt; However, [[Smeed's law]] predicts a fall in accident rate with increasing car ownership and has been demonstrated independently of seat belt legislation.

School buses which are much bigger in size than the average vehicle allow for the mass transportation of students from place to place. The American School Bus Council states in a brief article saying that, “The children are protected like eggs in an egg carton – compartmentalized, and surrounded with padding and structural integrity to secure the entire container.” (ASBC). Although school buses are considered safe for mass transit of students this will not guarantee that the students will be injury free if an impact were to occur. Seatbelts in buses are sometimes believed to make recovering from a roll or tip harder for students and staff as they could be easily trapped in their own safety belt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanschoolbuscouncil.org/school-bus-information-and-statistics/faq/why-dont-school-buses-have-seat-belts Why don’t school buses have seat belts? - American School Bus Council&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127060005/http://www.americanschoolbuscouncil.org/school-bus-information-and-statistics/faq/why-dont-school-buses-have-seat-belts |date=2016-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, for the first time, NHTSA endorsed seat belts on school buses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2015/11/10/seat-belts-school-buses-nhtsa-safety-parenting/ NHTSA reverses course, now wants seat belts on school buses&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Motor coaches====
In the European Union, all new long distance buses and coaches must be fitted with seat belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epha.org/a/1765|title=EU law makes seat belts obligatory in long distance buses and coaches|date=2006-07-19|publisher=[[European Public Health Alliance]]|accessdate=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has required lap/sash seat belts in new coaches since 1994. These must comply with Australian Design Rule 68, which requires the seat belt, seat and seat anchorage to withstand 20[[g-force|g]] deceleration and an impact by an unrestrained occupant to the rear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Griffths M|author2=Paine M|author3=Moore R|url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv19/05-0017-O.pdf|title=Three point seat belts on coaches - the first decade in Australia|date=2005-06-15|publisher=U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|accessdate=15 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328204452/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv19/05-0017-O.pdf|archivedate=28 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, NHTSA has now required lap-shoulder seat belts in new "over-the-road" buses (includes most coaches) starting in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NHTSA Announces Final Rule Requiring Seat Belts on Motorcoaches|url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/About+NHTSA/Press+Releases/NHTSA+Announces+Final+Rule+Requiring+Seat+Belts+on+Motorcoaches|publisher=NHTSA|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trains===
The use of seatbelts in trains has been investigated. Concerns about survival space intrusion in train crashes and increased injuries to unrestrained or incorrectly restrained passengers led the researchers to discourage the use of seat belts in trains.

:"It has been shown that there is no net safety benefit for passengers who choose to wear 3-point restraints on passenger carrying rail vehicles. Generally passengers who choose not to wear restraints in a vehicle modified to accept 3-point restraints receive marginally more severe injuries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/RSSB_Seatbelts2007.pdf |title=Assessment of Three-point Passenger Restraints (seatbelts) Fitted to Seats on Rail Vehicles|format=PDF |accessdate=2011-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airplanes===
Lap belts are found on all passenger aircraft. Many [[civil aviation]] authorities require a "fasten seat belt" sign in passenger aircraft that can be activated by a pilot during takeoff, turbulence, and landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/publications/Documents/guidance-on-turbulence-management.pdf|title=GUIDANCE FOR TURBULENCE MANAGEMENT|year=2012|publisher=International Air Transport Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304050534/http://www.iata.org/publications/Documents/guidance-on-turbulence-management.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title14-vol1/pdf/CFR-2012-title14-vol1-sec23-785.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] recommends the use of child restraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/Newsroom/Pages/ICAO-Manual-Provides-New-Recommended-Practices-For-Aircraft-Cabin-Child-Restraint-Systems.aspx|title=ICAO Manual Provides New Recommended Practices For Aircraft Cabin Child Restraint Systems|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Simple Skincare''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] brand of soap and skincare products, designed for [[sensitive skin]]. Simple has been owned by [[Unilever]] since 2010.

==History==
The brand was developed in 1960 by the Albion Group. In the late 1980s the business was acquired by [[Smith and Nephew]]. In June 2000, [[Smith and Nephew]] divested its consumer products division; a management buyout, led by CEO Geoff Percy and Finance Director Peter Hatherly, for £140m resulted in the formation of '''Accantia''', owner of the Simple brand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Board|url=http://www.orionmedia.com/corporate/the-board/|publisher=Orion Media|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, a secondary buyout was completed. Following an unsolicited approach, the board of Accantia sold the company to [[Duke Street Capital]] for £225m. Accantia's existing senior management team remained in place.

In April 2009, Accantia changed its name to '''Simple Health &amp; Beauty Group Limited'''. Simple Health &amp; Beauty Group Limited was bought by the US company [[Alberto-Culver]] for £240 million in December 2009. Alberto-Culver was bought by the Anglo–Dutch multinational consumer goods company [[Unilever]] in September 2010, and Simple was formally taken over around six months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Unilever to Purchase Alberto Culver for $3.7 Billion|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-09-27/unilever-agrees-to-buy-alberto-culver-for-3-7-billion|accessdate=21 March 2015|work=Bloomberg Business|date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising ==
In 1986, the company asked its advertising agency Deighton &amp; Mullen to produce a TV commercial. Entitled [http://www.hatads.org.uk/catalogue/record/861ba642-77ad-47cc-b34a-974ca3e86956 'Gilding the Lily'], this ran on the newly launched [[Channel 4]] and featured a  pristine white lily being sprayed by robotic arms with colouring and perfume. It was created by Colin Underhay (art director) and Alex Pearl (copywriter) and directed by [[Len Fulford]], while [[Lord David Dundas]] wrote the piano score in the style of Erik Satie, and [[Joanna Lumley]] provided the voice over.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6026">A '''slurry pipeline''' is a specially engineered pipeline used to move ores, such as coal or iron, or mining waste, called [[tailings]], over long distances. A mixture of the ore concentrate and water, called [[slurry]], is pumped to its destination and the water is filtered out. Due to the abrasive properties of [[slurry]], the pipelines can be lined with [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE).  Slurry pipelines are used as an alternative to railroad transportation when mines are located in remote, inaccessible areas.
== Process ==
The concentrate of the ore is mixed with water and then pumped over a long distance to a port where it can be shipped for further processing.  At the end of the pipeline, the material is separated from the [slurry] in a filter press to remove the water.  This water is usually subjected to a waste treatment process before disposal or return to the mine. Slurry pipelines offer an economic advantage over railroad transport and much less noise disturbance to the environment, particularly when mines are in extremely remote areas.

Pipelines must be suitably engineered to resist abrasion from the solids as well as corrosion from the soil. Some of these pipelines are lined with [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE).

Typical materials that are transferred using slurry pipelines include [[coal]],&lt;ref&gt;Hydraulic Transport of Coal in Combination With Oil Granulation / V.Biletsky // 8th International Conference on “Transport and Sedimentation of Solid Particles” 24–26 January 1995, Pragye, Czech Republic. D6-1 – D6-11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[copper]], [[iron]], and [[phosphate]] concentrates,  [[limestone]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], [[bauxite]] and [[oil sands]].

Slurry pipelines are also used to transport [[tailings]] from a mineral processing plant after the ore has been processed in order to dispose of the remaining rocks or clays.

For oil sand plants, a mixture of oil sand and water may be pumped over a long distance to release the [[bitumen]] by [[ablation]]. These pipelines are also called [[hydrotransport]] pipelines.

==History==
Early modern slurry pipelines include The Ohio 'Consolidation' coal slurry pipeline (1957) and the Kensworth to Rugby limestone slurry pipeline (1965) &lt;ref&gt;B.E.A. Jacobs (1991) Design of Slurry Transport Systems pp285-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 85&amp;nbsp;km Savage River Slurry pipeline in [[Tasmania]], [[Australia]], was possibly the world's first slurry pipeline to transport iron ore when it was built in 1967. It includes a 366m bridge span at  167m above the Savage River. It carries iron ore slurry from the [[Savage River, Tasmania|Savage River]] open cut mine owned by Australian Bulk Minerals and was still operational as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pipeliner.com.au/news/the_savage_river_slurry_pipeline/054155/|accessdate=2011-05-07|title=The Savage River Slurry Pipeline - The Australian Pipeliner|date=January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518235759/http://pipeliner.com.au/news/the_savage_river_slurry_pipeline/054155/|archivedate=2011-05-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highestbridges.com/wiki/index.php?title=Savage_River_Pipeline_Bridge|title=Savage River Pipeline Bridge - Highestbridges.com|accessdate=2011-05-07|date=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned projects==
One of the longest slurry pipelines was to be the proposed ETSI pipeline, to transport coal from Wyoming to Louisiana over a distance of 1036 miles (1675&amp;nbsp;km). It was never commissioned. It is anticipated that in the next few years some long distance slurry pipelines will be constructed in Australia and South America where mineral deposits are often a few hundred kilometers away from shipping ports.

A 525&amp;nbsp;km slurry pipeline is planned for the [[Minas-Rio]] iron ore mine in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bnamericas.com/project-profile/en/Minas-Rio-Minas-Rio|accessdate=2010-12-12|title=Project Profiles, Minas-Rio|date=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slurry pipelines are also being considered to [[desilt]] or remove silts from deposits behind dams in man-made lakes.  After the [[Hurricane Katrina]] disaster there were proposals to remedy the environment by pumping silt to the shore.  Proposals have also been made to de-silt [[Lake Nasser|Lake Nubia-Nasser]] in [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] by slurry pipelines, as Egypt is now deprived of 95% of its [[alluvium]], which used to arrive every year.  These projects to remedy the environment might alleviate one of the major problems associated with large dams and man-made lakes.

[[ESSAR Steel India Limited]] owns two 250&amp;nbsp;km+ slurry pipelines in India; the Kirandul-Vishakhapatnam (slurry pipeline) and Dabuna-Paradeep pipeline.

[[File:Stationery Store in Davarabad, Garmsar.jpg|thumb|A picture of a stationery shop on November 4, 1973, [[Iran]]]]
'''Stationery''' is a [[mass noun]] referring to commercially manufactured writing materials, including cut [[paper]], [[envelope]]s, [[writing implement]]s, [[continuous stationery|continuous form paper]], and other [[office supplies]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Beal, ed., "Stationery", ''A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology, 1450–2000'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008 [2011 online]).&lt;/ref&gt; Stationery includes materials to be written on by hand (e.g., letter paper) or by equipment such as [[computer printer]]s.

==History of stationery==
Originally the term ''stationery'' referred to all products sold by a stationer, whose name indicated that his book shop was on a fixed spot, usually near a university, and permanent, while medieval trading was mainly carried on by itinerant [[peddler]]s (including [[chapmen]], who sold books) and others (such as farmers and craftsmen) at [[Market (place)|markets]] and [[fair]]s. It was a special term used between the 13th and 15th centuries in the [[manuscript culture]]. The [[Stationers' Company]] formerly held a monopoly over the publishing industry in England and was responsible for [[copyright]] regulations.

In its modern sense including personal writing materials, stationery has been an important part of good social [[etiquette]], particularly since the [[Victorian era]]. Some uses of stationery, such as sending a manufactured reply card to a wedding invitation, have changed from offensive{{clarifyme|date=October 2016}} to appropriate.

The use and marketing of stationery is being partly superseded by [[electronic media]]. Stationery is intrinsically linked to paper and the process of written, personalized communication, and many techniques of stationery manufacture are employed, of varying desirability and expense. The most familiar of these techniques are letterpress printing, [[paper embossing|embossing]], engraving and thermographic printing (often confused with [[thermography]]). Flat printing and offset printing are regularly used, particularly for low-cost or informal needs.

==Uses of stationery==
===Printing===&lt;!--Don't add too much, the article is about stationery, printing is covered in separate articles--&gt;

====Letterpress====
[[File:Stationery-Letterpress.jpg|thumb|Example of inked letterpress process]]
{{Main|Letterpress printing}}
Letterpress is a method of printing many identical copies that requires characters being impressed upon the page. The print may be inked or blind but is typically done in a single color. Motifs or designs may be added as many letterpress machines use movable plates that must be hand-set.
{{Clear}}

====Single documents====
{{Main|Computer printer}}
When a single document needs to be produced, it may be handwritten or printed typically by a computer printer. Several copies of one original can be produced by some printers using [[multipart stationery]]. Typing with a [[typewriter]] is obsolescent, having been largely superseded by preparing a document with a [[word processor]] and printing.

====Thermographic====
[[File:Thermo-stationery.jpg|thumb|Example of [[thermographic printing]]. The uneven quality of the text is a result of the process and easily differentiates thermographic printing from embossing]]
{{Main|Thermographic printing}}

[[Thermographic printing]] is a process that involves several stages but can be implemented in a low-cost manufacturing process. The process involves printing the desired designs or text with an ink that remains wet, rather than drying on contact with the paper. The paper is then dusted with a powdered polymer that adheres to the ink. The paper is vacuumed or agitated, mechanically or by hand, to remove excess powder, and then heated to near combustion. The wet ink and polymer bond and dry, resulting in a raised print surface similar to the result of an engraving process.
{{Clear}}

===Embossing===
[[File:Embossing-stationery.jpg|thumb|Example of an [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] design]]
[[Embossing (paper)|Embossing]] is a printing technique used to create raised surfaces in the converted paper stock. The process relies upon mated dies that press the paper into a shape that can be observed on both the front and back surfaces.
{{Clear}}

===Engraving===
[[File:Engraving Plate Example.jpg|thumb|Example of a brass engraving plate, showing heavy wear. The plate is hand or machine engraved, inked, and forced into paper at extremely high pressures.]]
{{Main|Engraving}}
[[Engraving]] is a process that requires a design to be cut into a plate made of a relatively hard material. It is a technology with a long history and requires significant skill and experience. The finished plate is usually covered in ink, and then the ink is removed from all of the un-etched portions of the plate. The plate is then pressed into paper under substantial pressure. The result is a design that is slightly raised on the surface of the paper and covered in ink. Due to the cost of the process and expertise required, many consumers opt for thermographic printing, a process that results in a similarly raised print surface, but through different means at less cost.

==School supplies==
Many shops that sell stationery also sell other school supplies for students in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]], including [[pocket calculator]]s, [[display board]]s, [[compass (drafting)|compasses]] and [[protractor]]s, [[lunchbox]]es, and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/uploads/downloads/IP%20Issue%20Papers/IP04001_school_related_supplies_ip_7_29_04.pdf Streamlined Sales Tax Project "Definitions for School Related Supplies: SSTP Recommendations for Amendment to Agreement; July 29, 2004"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924110858/http://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/uploads/downloads/IP%20Issue%20Papers/IP04001_school_related_supplies_ip_7_29_04.pdf |date=September 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tax.virginia.gov/site.cfm?alias=SchoolSuppliesandClothingHolidayFAQs Virginia Department of Taxation "School Supplies and Clothing FAQs"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207155339/http://www.tax.virginia.gov/site.cfm?alias=SchoolSuppliesandClothingHolidayFAQs |date=2015-02-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retail dollar sales of back-to-school products from the office super stores grew 2 percent in August 2010 compared to August 2009, after July 2010 showed flat performance. The back-to-school season for school supplies had its best performance in the latter half of August, as many consumers waited until the last minute to purchase their supplies.&lt;ref&gt;A Late Back-To-School Season Shows Modest Recovery for the Office Supplies Industry, by The [[NPD Group]]: {{cite web |url=https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr_100916/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-15 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304192440/https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/press-releases/pr_100916/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cannons were used by European royalty in the 18th century.&lt;ref name=boating&gt;{{cite book|title=MotorBoating|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TYNl07Z9Z3EC&amp;pg=PA11|date=May 1972|page=11|issn=1531-2623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cannons of this type are exhibited at the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]].&lt;ref name=boating/&gt; The [[Hamilton Watch Company]] has a sundial cannon manufactured by Rousseau of Paris ca. 1650.

== History ==
The earliest sundial cannons were used in Europe in the 1600s. They were also used in European parks during the 18th and early 19th centuries.&lt;ref name="Sirene2016"/&gt; The cannon-lens combination was mounted on a sundial.&lt;ref name="Magazines1911"/&gt; Sundial guns were also used in ships to mark noon.&lt;ref name="Wills2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MayallMayall2012"/&gt; Miniaturized toy versions of the guns were sold in 1979 as unassembled kits by Dixie Gun Works.&lt;ref name="Magazines1979"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xs8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA82|date=July 1979|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=82–83|issn=0032-4558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Operation ==
[[File:Cannon Sundial by Victor Chevalier, Paris cropped.jpg|thumb|right|A sundial cannon manufactured by Victor Chevalier of Paris ca. 1800. The linear ignition groove is in the same direction as the north-south axis of the sundial]]
The gun and the linear ignition groove of the fuse were aligned on a north-south axis, parallel to the one of the sundial, while the lens concentrated the sun rays on the fuse when the sun was directly above. Subsequently, the burning fuse ignited the powder placed in the barrel of the cannon. The lens was mounted on an adjustable frame, which enabled its position to be changed depending on the season.&lt;ref name="Wills2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MayallMayall2012"/&gt; During winter, in December for example, for the small brass cannon manufactured by Rousseau of Paris, the lens had to be lowered by four inches, compared to its position in June as the position of the sun in the sky is lower in winter than during the summer.&lt;ref name="MayallMayall2012"/&gt; 

In naval operations, the gun had to be mounted on a rotating base because its orientation had to be in the north-south direction. The directional axis of the gun was determined using the ship's compass. In such operation, the gun was frequently referred to as the "noonday gun" because it fired at noon.&lt;ref name="MayallMayall2012"/&gt; This practice became obsolete when the ship chronometer was invented. The use of the sundial cannon was subsequently confined to substandard ships.&lt;ref name="MayallMayall2012"/&gt;

==Benjamin Franklin==

[[Benjamin Franklin]] wrote the following review about the cannons in ''[[Poor Richard's Almanack]]'':&lt;ref name="Wills2014"/&gt; {{blockquote|How to make a STRIKING SUNDIAL, by which not only a Man's own Family, but all his Neighbours for ten Miles round, may know what o'Clock it is, when the Sun shines, without seeing the dial. [...] Note also, That the chief Expence will be the Powder, for the Cannon once bought, will, with Care, last 100 Years. Note moreover, That there will be a great Saving of Powder in cloudy Days. Kind Reader, Methinks I hear thee say, That is indeed a good Thing to know how the Time passes.}}

==''Popular Mechanics''==
[[File:Sundial Cannon Popular Mechanics 1911.png|thumb|right|A farmer shown adjusting the lens position for a sundial cannon. From an article titled "Women 'Insurgents' in the Farming Business" in the July 1911 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''. The original caption is: "Adjusting the Sundial which Sets Off the Cannon Automatically at Noon"]]

In a section of the July 1911 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' titled "Women 'Insurgents' in the Farming Business" the writer comments regarding the picture to the right:&lt;ref name="Magazines1911"/&gt; {{blockquote|Whatever may be surmised at first glance, the lady of the exaggerated jupe-culotte is not a member of the Mexican insurrectionist artillery preparing to defend her pretty little private fort against the forces of the tyrant Diaz. The insurrection, however, is all there and all directed against the tyrant Man. In fine, she of the honest workingman's jeans is one of the suffragette farmerettes now being turned out by Mrs Belmont's Long Island colony—to the general end that they may run the earth in absolute independence of the legitimate occupants of similar jeans. The cannon is a sort of emancipated dinnerbell, and the thing that looks like one end of a stereoscope is a lens rigged to the sundial which forms the cannon's bed. As the sun works around to noon, the solar rays are focused on the fuse, and with the blast, liberated woman knows that dinner is served. And, if one pause to wonder, this is a refined and soothing way to fire a cannon. Having set the mechanism, even an average walker can put ten miles of quiet open country between herself and the chance of shattered eardrums and lacerated nerves.}}

== In literature ==
A sundial gun is mentioned in ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Queen1950"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ellery Queen|title=Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MKMxAQAAIAAJ|year=1950|publisher=Davis Publications, Incorporated|page=14|quote="Every kind of piece, big and small, and bullet molds with sample bullets, crucibles, lead ingots, powder and ball, powder horns and flasks — the finest collection in Northern Virginia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2801">In experimental physics, a '''wetting layer''' is an initial layer of [[atom]]s that is [[Epitaxy|epitaxially]] grown on a surface upon which self-assembled [[quantum dot]]s or [[thin film]]s are created.  The atoms composing a wetting layer can be semimetallic elements/compounds (usually [[Indium arsenide|InAs]] in the case of self-assembled quantum dots) or metallic alloys (for thin films).  This article refers to the wetting layer used for quantum dot applications.  By spraying a surface with layers of these atoms under high temperature, this '''wetting layer''' residue is produced on the surface.  Wetting layers  control the artificial atomic states of the quantum dot for uses in [[quantum information]] processing and [[quantum computation]].

==Process==

The wetting layer is epitaxially grown onto a surface using a [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE) chamber at high temperatures.  The temperatures required for wetting layer growth usually range from 400-500 degrees [[Celsius]].  If a [[self-assembled quantum dot]] is to form, an initial layer of atoms must first be placed on a surface.  Due to the high elastic potential energy once a certain critical thickness is achieved, additional atoms group together to form the quantum dot to reduce this [[elastic energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S. | last2 = Lazarenkova | first2 = O. | last3 = Von Allmen | first3 = P. | last4 = Oyafuso | first4 = F. | last5 = Klimeck | first5 = G. | title = Effect of wetting layers on the strain and electronic structure of InAs self-assembled quantum dots | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevB.70.125307 | journal = Physical Review B | volume = 70 | issue = 12 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = cond-mat/0405019 |bibcode = 2004PhRvB..70l5307L }}&lt;/ref&gt; If further [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] of the quantum dot/wetting layer [[system]] is necessary, higher temperatures of up to 1100 degrees may be used.

==Properties==

The wetting layer serves as another [[parameter]] that can change the physics of a quantum dot.  The thickness and composition determine the effect of the wetting layer on the quantum dot, however the thickness is usually roughly 0.5 [[nanometer]]s.  The [[electronic structure]] and strain of the quantum dot change as a result of the wetting layer.  Theoretically, due to the lattice mismatch, finite thickness wetting layers are not stable and therefore admit some [[strain (chemistry)|strain]] on the quantum dot.

==Applications==
The wetting layer serves as another parameter which can interfere with the quantum dots in order to control their [[Quantum state|state]] for quantum computation and other applications of quantum dots.

'''Yakov Rekhter''' is a well-known network protocol designer and software programmer. He was heavily involved in internet protocol  development, and its predecessors, from their early stages.

Dr. Rekhter was one of the leading architects and a major software developer of the [[NSFNET]] Backbone Phase II. He co-designed the [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP), the core routing protocol of the Internet. He was also one of the lead designers of Tag Switching (of which [[MPLS]] is one form), BGP/MPLS based VPNs, and MPLS Traffic Engineering. Among his most recent activities is the work on MPLS Multicast, Multicast in [[VPLS]], and Multicast in BGP/MPLS VPNs (aka 2547 VPNs). His other contributions to contemporary Internet technology include: [[GMPLS]], [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) and IP address allocation for [[Private network|private Internets]].

He is the author or co-author of more than 80 IETF RFCs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arkko.com/tools/rfcstats/authactdistr.html|title=Distribution of authors according to how many documents they have|author=Jari Arkko|accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous papers and articles on TCP/IP and the Internet. His recent books include: ''MPLS: Technology and Applications'' (Morgan Kaufmann, 2000) and ''Switching in IP Networks: IP Switching, Tag Switching and Related Technologies'' (Morgan Kaufmann, 1998).

Rekhter joined [[Juniper Networks]] in December 2000, where he was a Juniper Fellow. Prior to joining Juniper, Yakov worked at [[Cisco Systems]], where he was a Cisco Fellow. Prior to joining Cisco in 1995, he worked at [[IBM T.J. Watson Research Center]].

He retired from [[Juniper Networks]] and the industry in January 2015.

==Napkin Story==
In January 1989 at the 12th IETF meeting in Austin, Texas, Yakov Rekhter and Kirk Lougheed sat down at a table to design what ultimately became the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). The initial BGP design was recorded on a napkin rumored to have been heavily spattered with ketchup. The design on the napkin was expanded to three hand-written sheets of paper from which the first interoperable BGP implementation was quickly developed. A photocopy of these 3 sheets of paper now hangs on the wall of a routing protocol development area at [[Cisco Systems]] in [[Milpitas, California]].

== History ==
 
YourCash was established in 2000, as a [[private limited company]] under the name Hanco ATM Systems. It supplied machines in convenience locations such as grocers, corner shops, and garden centres.

In 2003 it opened operations in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Another Hannon joins Hanco's UK ATM operations|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/articles/another-hannon-joins-hancos-uk-atm-operations/|accessdate=23 May 2016|agency=ATM Marketplace|publisher=Networld Media Group, LLC.|date=19 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]] Group acquired Hanco ATM systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Bank of Scotland acquires Hanco ATM Systems|url=http://www.atmmarketplace.com/news/royal-bank-of-scotland-acquires-hanco-atm-systems/|accessdate=23 May 2016|agency=ATM Marketplace|publisher=Networld Media Group, LLC.|date=22 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2006 had begun rolling out free-to-use ATMs in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Inman|first1=Phillip|title=Cash machine operators to take £250m in fees|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2005/nov/12/business.accounts|accessdate=23 May 2016|agency=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=12 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010 the business underwent a management buyout process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sinclair|first1=Emma|title=How Jenny Campbell went from banking to start-ups|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/9717609/How-Jenny-Campbell-went-from-banking-to-start-ups.html|accessdate=23 May 2016|agency=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|date= 3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that saw ownership divest from RBS and become a standalone Private Limited Company - YourCash Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dey|first1=Ian|last2=Goodman|first2=Matthew|title=RBS withdraws from cash machines|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/business/Finance/article265626.ece|accessdate=23 May 2016|agency=The Sunday Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|date=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time, YourCash also began expansion into Belgium which was completed in 2011.
