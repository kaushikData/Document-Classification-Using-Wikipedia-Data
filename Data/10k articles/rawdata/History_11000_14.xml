It is distinct from the century known as the '''1900s''' which began on January 1, 1900 and ended on December 31, 1999.

The 20th century was dominated by a chain of events that heralded significant changes in world history as to redefine the era: [[Spanish flu|flu pandemic]], [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], [[nuclear power]] and [[space exploration]], [[nationalism]] and [[decolonization]], the [[Cold War]] and post-Cold War conflicts; [[intergovernmental organization]]s and [[cultural homogenization]] through developments in [[Emerging technologies|emerging]] [[transportation]] and [[communications technology]]; [[poverty reduction]] and [[world population]] growth, awareness of [[environmental degradation]], [[ecological extinction]];&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[E.O.

It saw great advances in communication and medical technology that by the late 1980s allowed for [[Internet|near-instantaneous worldwide computer communication]] and [[genetic modification]] of life.

Global [[total fertility rate]]s, [[sea level rise]] and [[ecological collapse]]s increased; the resulting competition for land and dwindling resources accelerated [[deforestation]], water depletion, and the [[Holocene extinction|mass extinction]] of many of the world's species and decline in the population of others; consequences which are now being dealt with.

[[File:Arthur Mees Flags of A Free Empire 1910 Cornell CUL PJM 1167 01.jpg|thumb|230px|Map of the [[British Empire]] (as of 1910). At its height, it was the [[List of largest empires|largest empire]] in history.]]
The century had the first [[World war|global-scale]] [[total war]]s between world powers across continents and oceans in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. [[Nationalism]] became a major political issue in the world in the 20th century, acknowledged in [[international law]] along with the right of [[nation]]s to [[self-determination]], official [[decolonization]] in the mid-century, and related regional conflicts.

The century saw a major shift in the way that many people lived, with changes in politics, ideology, economics, society, culture, science, technology, and medicine. The 20th century may have seen more technological and scientific progress than all the other centuries combined since the dawn of civilization. Terms like ''[[ideology]]'', ''[[world war]]'', ''[[genocide]],'' and ''[[nuclear war]]'' entered common usage. Scientific discoveries, such as the [[theory of relativity]] and [[quantum physics]], profoundly changed the foundational models of physical science, forcing scientists to realize that the universe was more complex than previously believed, and dashing the hopes (or fears) at the end of the 19th century that the last few details of scientific knowledge were about to be filled in. It was a century that started with [[horse|horses]], simple automobiles, and [[Cargo ship|freighters]] but ended with [[high-speed rail]], [[cruise ships]], global [[Airline|commercial air travel]] and the [[Space Shuttle]]. Horses, Western society's basic form of personal transportation for thousands of years, were replaced by automobiles and buses within a few decades. These developments were made possible by the exploitation of [[fossil fuel]] resources, which offered energy in an easily portable form, but also caused concern about pollution and long-term impact on the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Humans explored [[outer space|space]] for the first time, taking their first footsteps on the [[Moon]].

[[File:World_1914_empires_colonies_territory.PNG|thumb|750px|center|{{center|World powers and empires in 1914, just before the First World War}}]]

Mass media, telecommunications, and information technology (especially computers, [[paperback book]]s, [[public education]], and the [[Internet]]) made the world's knowledge more widely available. Advancements in [[medical technology]] also improved the health of many people: the global life expectancy increased from 35 years to 65 years. Rapid technological advancements, however, also allowed warfare to reach unprecedented levels of destruction. World War II alone killed over 60 million people, while [[nuclear weapons]] gave humankind the means to annihilate itself in a short time. However, these same wars resulted in the destruction of the imperial system. For the first time in human history, [[empire]]s and their wars of expansion and colonization ceased to be a factor in international affairs, resulting in a far more globalized and cooperative world. The last time major powers clashed openly was in 1945, and since then, violence has seen an unprecedented decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Stephen|title=The Better Angels of Our Nature|date=2011|publisher=Viking|isbn=978-0-670-02295-3|titlelink=The Better Angels of Our Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world also became more [[monoculturalism|culturally homogenized]] than ever with developments in transportation and communications technology, [[popular music]] and other influences of [[Western culture]], [[Multinational corporation|international corporation]]s, and what was arguably a truly [[economic globalization|global economy]] by the end of the 20th century.

===Summary===
Technological advancements during [[World War I]] changed the way war was fought, as new inventions such as [[tank]]s, [[chemical weapons]], and [[aircraft]] modified tactics and strategy.  After more than four years of [[trench warfare]] in Western Europe, and 20 million dead, the powers that had formed the [[Triple Entente]] ([[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], and [[Russian Empire|Russia]], later replaced by the [[United States]] and joined by [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]) emerged victorious over the [[Central Powers]] ([[German Empire|Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]). In addition to annexing many of the [[Colony|colonial possessions]] of the vanquished states, the Triple Entente exacted punitive restitution payments from them, plunging Germany in particular into [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|economic depression]]. The Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires were dismantled at the war's conclusion. The [[Russian Revolution]] resulted in the overthrow of the [[Tsar]]ist regime of [[Nicholas II]] and the onset of the [[Russian Civil War]]. The victorious [[Bolsheviks]] then established the [[Soviet Union]], the world's first [[communist state]].

Cambridge University Press. p. 167. {{ISBN|0-521-89424-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; almost half of all [[World War II casualties|World War II deaths]].]]

At the beginning of the period, the [[British Empire]] was the world's most powerful nation,&lt;ref name="ferguson"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Niall |year=2004 |title=Empire: The rise and demise of the British world order and the lessons for global power |publisher=Basic Books |location =New York |isbn=0-465-02328-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; having [[Pax Britannica|acted as the world's policeman]] for the past century. [[Fascism]], a movement which grew out of post-war [[angst]] and which accelerated during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, gained momentum in [[Italian Fascism|Italy]], [[Nazism|Germany]], and [[Falangism|Spain]] in the 1920s and 1930s, culminating in [[World War II]], sparked by [[Nazi Germany]]'s aggressive expansion at the expense of its neighbors. Meanwhile, [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] had rapidly transformed itself into a technologically advanced industrial power and, along with Germany and Italy, formed the [[Axis powers]]. Japan's military [[expansionism]] in [[East Asia]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] brought it into conflict with the United States, culminating in [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|a surprise attack]] which drew the US into World War II.  After some years of dramatic military success, Germany was [[German Instrument of Surrender|defeated]] in 1945, having been [[Western Allied invasion of Germany|invaded]] by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Poland]] [[Eastern Front (World War II)|from the East]] and by the United States, the United Kingdom, [[Canada]], and [[Free France|France]] [[Western Front (World War II)|from the West]]. After the victory of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in Europe, the [[Pacific War|war in Asia]] ended with the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of two atomic bombs]] on Japan by the US, the first nation to develop and use [[nuclear weapons]]. In total, World War II left some 60 million people dead. After the war, Germany was [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupied]] and divided between the [[Western Bloc|Western]] powers and the Soviet Union. [[East Germany]] and the rest of [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern Europe]] became Soviet [[puppet states]] under communist rule. Western Europe was rebuilt with the aid of the American [[Marshall Plan]], resulting in a major [[Post–World War II economic expansion|post-war economic boom]], and many of the affected nations became close allies of the United States.

With the Axis defeated and Britain and France rebuilding, the United States and the Soviet Union were left standing as the world's only [[superpower]]s. Allies during the war, they soon became hostile to one another as their competing ideologies of [[communism]] and [[democratic capitalism]] proliferated in Europe, which became divided by the [[Iron Curtain]] and the [[Berlin Wall]]. They formed competing military alliances ([[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]) which engaged in a decades-long standoff known as the [[Cold War]]. The period was marked by a [[Nuclear arms race|new arms race]] as the USSR became the second nation to develop nuclear weapons, which were produced by both sides in sufficient numbers to [[Nuclear holocaust|end most human life on the planet]] had a large-scale nuclear exchange ever occurred. [[Mutual assured destruction|Mutually assured destruction]] is credited by many historians as having prevented such an exchange, each side being unable to [[Pre-emptive nuclear strike|strike first]] at the other without ensuring an equally devastating [[Second strike|retaliatory strike]]. Unable to engage one another directly, the conflict played out in a series of [[proxy war]]s around the world–particularly in [[Chinese Civil War|China]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], and [[Soviet–Afghan War|Afghanistan]]–as the USSR sought to [[World communism|export communism]] while the US attempted to [[Containment|contain it]]. The technological competition between the two sides led to substantial investment in [[research and development]] which produced innovations that reached far beyond the battlefield, such as [[Space Race|space exploration]] and the [[Internet]].

[[File:Albert Einstein Head.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Albert Einstein]] is often regarded as the father of [[modern physics]].]]
In the latter half of the century, most of the [[History of colonialism|European-colonized world]] in Africa and Asia gained independence in a process of [[decolonization]]. Meanwhile, [[globalization]] opened the door for several nations to exert a strong influence over many world affairs. The US's global military presence spread [[Culture of the United States|American culture]] around the world with the advent of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood motion picture industry]], [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], [[rock and roll]], [[pop music]], [[fast food]], [[big-box store]]s, and the [[hip-hop]] lifestyle. Britain also continued to influence world [[culture]], including the "[[British Invasion]]" into [[Music of the United States|American music]], leading many [[Band (rock and pop)|rock band]]s from other countries (such as Swedish [[ABBA]]) to sing in English. After [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union collapsed]] under internal pressure in 1991, most of the communist governments it had supported around the world [[Revolutions of 1989|were dismantled]]—with the notable exceptions of [[China]], [[North Korea]], [[Cuba]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Laos]]—followed by awkward transitions into market economies.

Following World War II, the [[United Nations]], successor to the [[League of Nations]], was established as an international forum in which the world's nations could discuss issues diplomatically. It enacted [[United Nations resolution|resolution]]s on such topics as the conduct of warfare, environmental protection, international [[sovereignty]], and [[human rights]]. [[Peacekeeping]] forces consisting of troops provided by various countries, with various United Nations and other aid agencies, helped to relieve famine, disease, and poverty, and to suppress some local armed conflicts. Europe slowly united, economically and, in some ways, politically, to form the [[European Union]], which consisted of 15 European countries by the end of the 20th century.

In the last third of the century, concern about humankind's impact on the Earth's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] made [[environmentalism]] popular. In many countries, especially in Europe, the movement was channeled into politics through [[Green party|Green parties]]. Increasing awareness of [[global warming]] began in the 1980s, commencing decades of social and political debate.[[File:Apple II Plus, Museum of the Moving Image.jpg|thumb|The [[computer]] is a major technological advancement in this century.]]

=== The nature of innovation and change ===
Due to continuing industrialization and expanding trade, many significant changes of the century were, directly or indirectly, economic and technological in nature. Inventions such as the [[light bulb]], the [[automobile]], and the [[telephone]] in the late 19th century, followed by [[supertanker]]s, [[airliner]]s, motorways, [[radio]], [[television]], [[antibiotics]], [[nuclear power]], [[frozen food]], [[computers]] and [[microcomputer]]s, the [[Internet]], and [[mobile telephone]]s affected people's [[quality of life]] across the developed world. Scientific research, engineering professionalization and technological development—much of it motivated by the [[Cold War]] arms race—drove changes in everyday life.

=== Social change ===
[[File:Martin_Luther_King_-_March_on_Washington.jpg|thumb|[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], an [[African Americans|African American]] civil rights leader.]]

At the beginning of the century, strong discrimination based on race and sex was significant in general society. Although the [[Atlantic slave trade]] had ended in the 19th century, the fight for equality for non-white people in the white-dominated societies of [[Civil rights movement|North America]], Europe, and [[Apartheid|South Africa]] continued. During the century, the social taboo of [[sexism]] fell. By the end of the 20th century, women had the same legal rights as men in many parts of the world, and racism had come to be seen as abhorrent.&lt;ref&gt;Fleegler, Robert L. [http://mdah.state.ms.us/pubs/bilbo.pdf Theodore G. Bilbo and the Decline of Public Racism, 1938-1947] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206151355/http://mdah.state.ms.us/pubs/bilbo.pdf |date=2009-02-06 }}. Retrieved 23 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Attitudes towards [[homosexuality]] also began to change in the later part of the century.

=== The world at the end of the 20th century ===
Communications and information technology, transportation technology, and medical advances had radically altered daily lives. Europe appeared to be at a sustainable peace for the first time in recorded history. The people of the [[Indian subcontinent]], a sixth of the world population at the end of the 20th century, had attained an [[Partition of India|indigenous independence]] for the first time in centuries. China, an ancient nation comprising a fifth of the world population, was finally [[Chinese economic reform|open to the world]], creating a new state after the near-complete destruction of the old cultural order. With the end of colonialism and the Cold War, nearly a billion people in Africa were left in new nation states after centuries of foreign domination.

The world was undergoing its second major period of [[globalization]]; the first, which started in the 18th century, having been terminated by World War I. Since the US was in a dominant position, a major part of the process was [[Americanization]]. The influence of China and India was also rising, as the world's largest populations were rapidly integrating with the world economy.

[[Terrorism]], [[dictatorship]], and the spread of [[nuclear weapon]]s were pressing global issues. The world was still blighted by small-scale wars and other violent conflicts, fueled by competition over resources and by ethnic conflicts. [[Despotism|Despots]] such as [[Kim Jong-il]] of [[North Korea]] continued to lead their nations toward the development of nuclear weapons.

Disease threatened to destabilize many regions of the world.  New viruses such as [[SARS]] and [[West Nile virus|West Nile]] continued to spread. [[Malaria]] and other diseases affected large populations.  Millions were infected with [[HIV]], the virus which causes [[AIDS]].  The virus was becoming an [[AIDS in Africa|epidemic in southern Africa]].

Based on research done by climate scientists, the majority of the scientific community consider that in the long term environmental problems may threaten the planet's habitability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Extreme and Irreversible Effects | at=[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/679.htm Sec 19.6.] | chapter-url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg2/657.htm | chapter=Ch. 19. Vulnerability to Climate Change and Reasons for Concern: A Synthesis | author=Smith, J.B.| ref=harv|display-authors=etal}}, in {{harvnb|IPCC TAR WG2|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One argument is that of [[global warming]] occurring due to human-caused emission of [[greenhouse gas]]es, particularly [[carbon dioxide]] produced by the burning of [[fossil fuel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Total radiative forcing is positive, and has led to an uptake of energy by the climate system.  The largest contribution to total radiative forcing is caused by the increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; since 1750." (p 11)  "From 1750 to 2011, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production have released 375 [345 to 405] GtC to the atmosphere, while deforestation and other land use change are estimated to have released 180 [100 to 260] GtC." (p 10), IPCC, Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis - Summary for Policymakers, Observed Changes in the Climate System, [http://www.climatechange2013.org/spm p. 10&amp;11], in {{Harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This prompted many nations to negotiate and sign the [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto treaty]], which set mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions.

[[World population]] increased from about 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion people in 1901 to 6.1&amp;nbsp;billion at the century's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_history.php|title=World Population: Historical Estimates of World Population|publisher=United States Census Bureau|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/international/data/worldpop/table_population.php|title=World Population: Total Midyear Population for the World: 1950-2050|publisher=United States Census Bureau|date=December 19, 2013|accessdate=2015-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people killed during the century by government actions was in the hundreds of millions. This includes deaths caused by wars, genocide, politicide and mass murders. The deaths from acts of war during the two world wars alone have been estimated at between 50 and 80 million{{Citation needed|date=February 2015|reason=also contradicted by figure of 100m by Tilly, below}}.

* After gaining political rights in the United States and much of Europe in the first part of the century, and with the advent of new [[birth control]] techniques, [[Women's suffrage|women became more independent]] throughout the century.
* Rising nationalism and increasing national awareness were among the many causes of World War I (1914–1918), the first of two wars to involve many major world powers including Germany, France, Italy, Japan, Russia/[[USSR]], the [[British Empire]] and the [[United States]]. World War I led to [[Aftermath of World War I#Territorial gains and losses|the creation of many new countries]], especially in Eastern Europe. At the time, it was said by many to be the "[[The war to end war|war to end all wars]]".
* [[Industrial warfare]] greatly increased in its scale and complexity during the first half of the 20th century. Notable developments included [[chemical warfare]], the introduction of [[military aviation]] and the widespread use of [[submarines]]. The introduction of [[nuclear warfare]] in the mid-20th century marked the definite transition to [[modern warfare]].
* Civil wars occurred in many nations. A violent [[Spanish Civil War|civil war]] broke out in Spain in 1936 when General [[Francisco Franco]] rebelled against the [[Second Spanish Republic]]. Many{{Who|date=July 2013}} consider this war as a testing battleground for World War II, as the fascist armies bombed some Spanish territories.
* The [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s led to the rise of [[Fascism]] and [[Nazism]] in Europe.
* [[World War II]] (1939–1945) involved [[Pacific War|Eastern Asia and the Pacific]], in the form of Japanese aggression against [[Second Sino-Japanese War|China]] and the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|United States]]. Civilians also suffered greatly in World War II, due to the [[aerial bombing of cities]] on both sides, and the German [[genocide]] of the Jews and others, known as [[the Holocaust]]. 
* During World War I, in the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, 300 years of [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] reign were ended and the [[Bolsheviks]], under the leadership of [[Vladimir Lenin]], established the [[Russian SFSR|world's first Communist state]]. After the [[Soviet Union in World War II|Soviet Union's involvement in World War II]], communism became a major force in [[global politics]], notably in Eastern Europe, China, [[Indochina]] and [[Cuba]], where [[Communist party|communist parties]] gained near-absolute power. This led to the [[Cold War]] and [[proxy war]]s with the [[Western bloc]], including wars in [[Korean War|Korea]] (1950–1953) and [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] (1957–1975).

* The [[civil rights movement]] in the United States and the movement against [[apartheid]] in South Africa challenged racial segregation in those countries.
* The two [[world war]]s led to efforts to increase [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]], notably through the founding of the [[League of Nations]] after World War I, and its successor, the [[United Nations]], after World War II.
* [[Nationalism|Nationalist movement]]s in the [[Indian subcontinent|subcontinent]] led to the independence and partition of India and Pakistan.
* [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s [[nonviolence]] and [[Indian independence movement]] against the [[British Empire]] influenced many [[political movement]]s around the world, including the [[civil rights movement]] in the U.S., and freedom movements in [[South Africa]] and [[Burma]].
* The [[Israeli Declaration of Independence|creation]] in 1948 of [[Israel]], a [[Jewish state]] in the [[Middle East]], by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] fueled many [[Arab–Israeli conflict|regional conflict]]s. These were also influenced by the vast [[oil field]]s in many of the other countries of the mostly Arab region.
* [[Decolonization|The end]] of [[colonialism]] led to the independence of many African and Asian countries. During the [[Cold War]], many of these aligned with the United States, the USSR, or China for defense.
* After a long period of civil wars and [[Boxer Rebellion|conflicts with western powers]], China's [[Qing dynasty|last imperial dynasty]] [[Xinhai Revolution|ended]] in 1912. The resulting [[Republic of China (1912–49)|republic]] was replaced, after [[Chinese Civil War|another civil war]], by a communist [[People's Republic]] in 1949. At the end of the 20th century, though still ruled by a communist party, China's economic system had [[Chinese economic reform|largely transformed]] to [[capitalism]].
* The [[Great Chinese Famine]] was a direct cause of the death of tens of millions of Chinese peasants between 1959 and 1962.

* [[European integration]] began in earnest in the 1950s, and eventually led to the [[European Union]], a political and economic union that comprised 15 countries at the end of the 20th century.

== Culture and entertainment ==
{{main|20th century in literature}}
[[File:Chagall IandTheVillage.jpg|thumb|''[[I and the Village]]'' by [[Marc Chagall]], a [[List of modern artists|modern painter]].]]
* As the century began, Paris was the artistic capital of the world, where both French and foreign writers, composers and visual artists gathered. By the end of the century [[New York City]] had become the artistic capital of the world.
* Theater, films, music and the media had a major influence on fashion and trends in all aspects of life. As many films and much music originate from the United States, American culture spread rapidly over the world.
* 1953 saw the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]], an iconic figure of the century.
* [[Visual culture]] became more dominant not only in films but in comics and television as well. During the century a new skilled understanding of narrativist imagery was developed.
* Computer games and internet surfing became new and popular form of entertainment during the last 25 years of the century.
* In Literature, science fiction, [[fantasy]] (with well-developed fictional worlds, rich in detail), and [[alternate history|alternative history]] fiction gained unprecedented popularity. [[Detective fiction]] gained unprecedented popularity in the [[interwar period]]. In the United States in 1961 [[Grove Press]] published ''[[Tropic of Cancer (novel)|Tropic of Cancer]]'' a novel by [[Henry Miller]] redefining pornography and censorship in publishing in America.

===Music===
{{main|20th-century music}}

The invention of music recording technologies such as the [[phonograph record]], and dissemination technologies such as [[radio broadcasting]], massively expanded the audience for music.  Prior to the 20th century, music was generally only experienced in [[concert|live performances]].  Many new genres of music were established during the 20th century.
[[File:Jimmy_Page_with_Robert_Plant_2_-_Led_Zeppelin_-_1977.jpg|thumb|[[Led Zeppelin]] are widely considered one of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history.]]
* [[Igor Stravinsky]] revolutionized classical composition.
* In the 1920s, [[Arnold Schoenberg]] developed the [[twelve-tone technique]], which became widely influential on 20th-century composers.
* In classical music, [[Musical composition|composition]] branched out into many completely new domains, including [[dodecaphony]], [[aleatoric music|aleatoric]] (chance) music, and [[minimalism]].
* [[Argentine tango|Tango]] was created in Argentina and became extremely popular in the rest of the Americas and Europe.
* [[Blues]] and [[jazz]] music became popularized during the 1910s and 1920s in the United States.
* Blues went on to influence [[rock and roll]] in the 1950s, which along with [[American folk music revival|Folk Music]], increased in popularity with the [[British Invasion]] of the mid-to-late 1960s.
* Rock soon branched into many different genres, including [[Folk rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[punk rock]], and [[alternative rock]] and became the dominant genre of [[popular music]].
* This was challenged with the rise of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] in the 1980s and 1990s.
* Other genres such as [[House music|house]], [[techno]], [[reggae]], and [[soul music|soul]] all developed during the latter half of the century and went through various periods of popularity. 
* Synthesizers began to be employed widely in music and crossed over into the mainstream with [[New wave music|new wave]] music in the 1980s. [[Electronic instruments]] have been widely deployed in all manners of popular music and has led to the development of such genres as [[house music|house]], [[synthpop]], [[electronic dance music]], and [[industrial music|industrial]].

The world's most popular / famous / revered music artists of the 20th century include : [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Gustav Mahler]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Benjamin Britten]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Bela Bartok]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Bing Crosby]], [[ABBA]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Beatles]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Little Richard]], [[Chuck Berry]], [[James Brown]], [[Miles Davis]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Elton John]], [[Robert Johnson]], [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Bob Marley]], [[Charlie Parker]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Nirvana (band)]], [[The Notorious B.I.G.]],[[Amr Diab]] , [[Fairuz]], [[Umm Kulthum]],[[Abdel Halim Hafez]], [[Randy Newman]]
and many more.

===Film, television and theatre===
{{see also|History of film}}

Film as an artistic medium was created in the 20th century.  The first modern movie theatre was established in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2005/06/19/You-saw-it-here-first-Pittsburgh-s-Nickelodeon-introduced-the-moving-picture-theater-to-the-masses-in-1905/stories/200506190169|title=You saw it here first: Pittsburgh's Nickelodeon introduced the moving picture theater to the masses in 1905|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=18 June 2005|accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hollywood]] developed as the center of American film production.  While the first films were in [[black and white]], [[technicolor]] was developed in the 1920s to allow for color films. [[Sound film]]s were developed, with the first full-length feature film, [[The Jazz Singer]], released in 1927.  The [[Academy Awards]] were established in 1929.

[[File:Chaplin_The_Kid_edit.jpg|thumb|[[Charlie Chaplin]] in his 1921 film ''[[The Kid (1921 film)|The Kid]]'', with [[Jackie Coogan]].]]
* [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[James Stewart]], [[Sidney Poitier]], [[Marlon Brando]], [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Bruce Lee]], [[James Dean]], [[Clark Gable]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Audrey Hepburn]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Harry Belafonte]],[[Paul Newman]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Julie Andrews]], and [[John Wayne]], are among the most popular film stars of the 20th century.
* [[D. W. Griffith]], [[Sergei Eisenstein]], [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Frank Capra]], [[Oscar Micheaux]], [[Howard Hawks]], [[John Ford]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Huston]], [[Alfred Hitchcock]], [[Akira Kurosawa]], [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Federico Fellini]], [[Walt Disney]], [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Quentin Tarantino]], [[James Cameron]], [[Spike Lee]], and [[George Lucas]] are among the most important and popular filmmakers of the 20th century.
* In theater, sometimes referred to as [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] in [[New York City]], playwrights like [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Edward Albee]], [[Arthur Miller]] and [[Tennessee Williams]] introduced innovative language and ideas to the idiom. In musical theater, figures like [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[Lerner and Loewe]], and [[Irving Berlin]] had an enormous impact on both film and the culture in general.[[File:Empire State Building (HDR).jpg|thumb|The [[Empire State Building]] is an iconic building of the 1930s.]]
* [[Modern Dance]] is born in America as both a 'rebellion' against centuries-old European ballet, as well as born from the oppression in America. [[Dancers]] and choreographers [[Alvin Ailey]], [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], [[Ruth St. Denis]], [[Martha Graham]], [[Jose Limon]], [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Merce Cunningham]], and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]] re-defined movement, struggling to bring it back to its 'natural' roots and along with Jazz, created a solely American art form. Alvin Ailey is credited with popularizing modern dance and revolutionizing African-American participation in 20th-century concert dance. His company gained the nickname "Cultural Ambassador to the World" because of its extensive international touring. Ailey's choreographic masterpiece Revelations is believed to be the best known and most often seen modern dance performance.

===Art and Architecture===
{{main|20th-century art}}
* The art world experienced the development of new styles and explorations such as [[fauvism]], [[expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], [[cubism]], [[de stijl]], [[surrealism]], [[abstract expressionism]], [[color field]], [[pop art]], [[minimal art]], [[lyrical abstraction]], and [[conceptual art]].
* The [[modern art]] movement revolutionized art and culture and set the stage for both [[Modernism]] and its counterpart [[postmodern art]] as well as other [[contemporary art]] practices.
* [[Art Nouveau]] began as advanced architecture and design but fell out of fashion after World War I. The style was dynamic and inventive but unsuited to the depression of the Great War.
* In Europe, [[modern architecture]] departed from the decorated styles of the [[Victorian era]]. Streamlined forms inspired by machines became commonplace, enabled by developments in [[building materials]] and technologies. Before World War II, many European architects moved to the United States, where modern architecture continued to develop.
* The automobile increased the mobility of people in the Western countries in the early-to-mid-century, and in many other places by the end of the 20th century. [[Urban planning|City design]] throughout most of the West became focused on transport via car.

===Sport===
* The popularity of sport increased considerably&amp;mdash;both as an activity for all, and as entertainment, particularly on television.
* The modern [[Olympic Games]], first held in 1896, grew to include tens of thousands of athletes in dozens of sports.
* The [[FIFA World Cup]] was first held in 1930, and was held every 4 years after World War II.

== Science ==

{{see also|Big Science}}

=== Mathematics ===
[[File:Alan Turing portré.jpg|thumb|190px|The pioneer of [[computer science]], [[Alan Turing]]]]

Multiple new fields of [[mathematics]] were developed in the 20th century.  In the first part of the 20th century, [[measure theory]], [[functional analysis]], and [[topology]] were established, and significant developments were made in fields such as [[abstract algebra]] and [[probability]].  The development of [[set theory]] and [[formal logic]] led to [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

Later in the 20th century, the development of [[computer]]s led to the establishment of a [[theory of computation]].&lt;ref name="BoyerMath"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/23823042|title=A history of mathematics|last=1906-1976.|first=Boyer, Carl B.

=== Physics ===

* New areas of [[physics]], like [[special relativity]], [[general relativity]], and [[quantum mechanics]], were developed during the first half of the century. In the process, the internal structure of [[atom]]s came to be clearly understood, followed by the discovery of [[elementary particle]]s.
* It was found that all the known [[force]]s can be traced to only four [[fundamental interaction]]s. It was discovered further that two forces, [[electromagnetism]] and [[weak interaction]], can be merged in the [[electroweak interaction]], leaving only three different fundamental interactions.
* Discovery of [[nuclear reaction]]s, in particular [[nuclear fusion]], finally revealed the source of [[sun|solar]] energy.
* [[Radiocarbon dating]] was invented, and became a powerful technique for determining the age of [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] animals and plants as well as [[History|historical]] objects.

=== Astronomy ===

* A much better understanding of the evolution of the [[universe]] was achieved, its [[Age of the universe|age]] (about 13.8 billion years) was determined, and the [[Big Bang]] theory on its origin was proposed and generally accepted.
* The age of the [[solar system]], including [[Earth]], was determined, and it turned out to be much older than believed earlier: more than 4&amp;nbsp;billion years, rather than the 20 million years suggested by [[Lord Kelvin]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomson |first=Sir William |title=On the Age of the Sun's Heat |journal=Macmillan's Magazine |year=1862 |volume=5 |pages=288–293 |url=http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/on_the_age_of_the_suns_heat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The planets of the solar system and their moons were closely observed via numerous [[space probe]]s. [[Pluto]] was discovered in 1930 on the edge of the solar system, although in the early 21st century, it was reclassified as a [[plutoid]] instead of a planet proper, leaving eight planets.
* No trace of [[life]] was discovered on any of the other planets in our solar system (or elsewhere in the universe), although it remained undetermined whether some forms of primitive life might exist, or might have existed, somewhere. [[Extrasolar planets]] were observed for the first time.

=== Biology ===
[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the [[Green Revolution]], is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]

* [[Genetics]] was unanimously accepted and significantly developed. The [[structure of DNA]] was determined in 1953 by [[James D. Watson|James Watson]],&lt;ref name="nobelmedicine1962"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/|work=NobelPrize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; [[Francis Crick]],&lt;ref name="nobelmedicine1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; [[Rosalind Franklin]]&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite web |title=James Watson, Francis Crick, Maurice Wilkins, and Rosalind Franklin |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/james-watson-francis-crick-maurice-wilkins-and-rosalind-franklin |work=Science History Institute |accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maurice Wilkins]],&lt;ref name="nobelmedicine1962"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; following by developing techniques which allow to read DNA sequences and culminating in starting the [[Human Genome Project]] (not finished in the 20th century) and [[Dolly (sheep)|cloning the first mammal]] in 1996.
* The role of [[sexual reproduction]] in evolution was understood, and [[bacterial conjugation]] was discovered.
* The convergence of various sciences for the formulation of the [[modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] (produced between 1936 and 1947), providing a widely accepted account of [[evolution]].

=== Medicine ===

[[File:Faroe stamp 079 europe (fleming).jpg|thumb|right|A stamp commemorating [[Alexander Fleming]]. His discovery of [[penicillin]] had changed the world of modern medicine by introducing the age of antibiotics.]]

* [[Placebo]]-[[scientific control|controlled]], [[random sample|randomized]], [[blind experiment|blinded]] [[clinical trial]]s became a powerful tool for testing new medicines.
* [[Antibiotics]] drastically reduced mortality from [[bacterial disease]]s and their [[prevalence]].
* A [[vaccine]] was developed for [[polio]], ending a worldwide epidemic.  Effective vaccines were also developed for a number of other serious infectious diseases, including [[influenza vaccine|influenza]], [[DPT vaccine|diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough), tetanus]], [[MMR vaccine|measles]], [[mumps vaccine|mumps]], [[MMR vaccine|rubella (German measles)]], [[varicella vaccine|chickenpox]], [[hepatitis A vaccine|hepatitis A]], and [[hepatitis B vaccine|hepatitis B]].
* [[Epidemiology]] and [[vaccination]] led to the eradication of the [[smallpox]] virus in humans.
* [[X-ray]]s became powerful diagnostic tool for wide spectrum of diseases, from bone fractures to cancer.  In the 1960s, [[computerized tomography]] was invented.  Other important diagnostic tools developed were [[sonography]] and [[magnetic resonance imaging]].
* Development of [[vitamins]] virtually eliminated [[scurvy]] and other vitamin-deficiency diseases from industrialized societies.
* New psychiatric drugs were developed.  These include [[antipsychotic]]s for treating [[hallucination]]s and [[delusion]]s, and [[antidepressant]]s for treating depression.
* The role of [[tobacco smoking]] in the causation of cancer and other diseases was proven during the 1950s (see [[British Doctors Study]]).
* New methods for cancer treatment, including [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]], and [[immunotherapy]], were developed. As a result, cancer could often be [[cure]]d or placed in [[remission (medicine)|remission]].
* The development of [[blood type|blood typing]] and [[blood bank]]ing made [[blood transfusion]] safe and widely available.
* The [[invention]] and development of [[immunosuppressive drug]]s and [[tissue typing]] made [[organ transplant|organ and tissue transplantation]] a clinical reality.
* New methods for [[heart surgery]] were developed, including [[pacemaker]]s and [[artificial heart]]s.
* [[Cocaine]]/[[Crack cocaine|crack]] and heroin were found to be dangerous addictive drugs, and their wide usage had been outlawed; mind-altering drugs such as [[LSD]] and [[MDMA]] were discovered and later outlawed. In many countries, a [[war on drugs]] caused prices to soar 10–20 times higher, leading to profitable [[black market]] [[drugdealer|drugdealing]], and to prison inmate sentences being 80% related to drug use by the 1990s.
* [[Contraceptive]] drugs were developed, which reduced population growth rates in industrialized countries, as well as decreased the taboo of [[premarital sex]] throughout many western countries.
* The development of medical [[insulin]] during the 1920s helped raise the life expectancy of [[diabetes|diabetics]] to three times of what it had been earlier.
* Vaccines, hygiene and clean water improved health and decreased mortality rates, especially among infants and the young.

==== Notable diseases ====

* An [[influenza]] pandemic, [[1918 flu pandemic|Spanish Flu]], killed anywhere from 20 to 100 million people between 1918 and 1919.
* A new [[virus|viral]] disease, called the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]], or HIV, arose in Africa and subsequently killed millions of people throughout the world. HIV leads to a syndrome called [[Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome]], or AIDS. Treatments for HIV remained inaccessible to many people living with AIDS and HIV in [[developing countries]], and a cure has yet to be discovered.
* Because of increased [[Life expectancy|life spans]], the [[prevalence]] of cancer, [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]], and other diseases of [[old age]] increased slightly.
* [[Sedentary lifestyle]]s, due to labor-saving devices and technology, along with the increase in home entertainment and technology such as television, video games, and the internet contributed to an "epidemic" of [[obesity]], at first in the rich countries, but by the end of the 20th century spreading to the developing world.

=== Energy and the environment ===
[[File:Oilfields California.jpg|thumb|[[Oil field]] in California, 1938.

The first modern oil well was drilled in 1848 by Russian engineer F.N. Semyonov, on the [[Apsheron Peninsula]] north-east of [[Baku]].]]

* The dominant use of [[fossil source]]s and [[nuclear power]], considered the conventional energy sources.
* Widespread use of petroleum in industry&amp;mdash;both as a chemical precursor to plastics and as a fuel for the automobile and [[airplane]]&amp;mdash;led to the geopolitical importance of petroleum resources. The Middle East, home to many of the world's oil deposits, became a center of geopolitical and military tension throughout the latter half of the century. (For example, oil was a factor in Japan's decision to go to war against the United States in 1941, and the oil cartel, [[OPEC]], used an oil embargo of sorts in the wake of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in the 1970s).
* The increase in [[fossil fuel]] consumption also fueled a major scientific controversy over its effect on air pollution, [[global warming]], and global [[climate change]].
* [[Pesticide]]s, [[herbicide]]s and other [[toxicity|toxic]] [[chemical substance|chemicals]] accumulated in the environment, including in the bodies of humans and other animals.
* [[Human overpopulation|Overpopulation]] and worldwide [[deforestation]] diminished the [[environmental quality|quality of the environment]].

== Engineering and technology ==
[[File:First flight2.jpg|thumb|right|First flight of the [[Wright Flyer]] I, December 17, 1903, Orville piloting, Wilbur running at wingtip.]]

One of the prominent traits of the 20th century was the dramatic growth of technology. Organized research and practice of science led to advancement in the fields of communication, engineering, travel, medicine, and war.

* The number and types of [[home appliances]] increased dramatically due to advancements in technology, electricity availability, and increases in wealth and leisure time. Such basic appliances as [[washing machine]]s, [[clothes dryer]]s, furnaces, [[exercise machine]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, freezers, [[electric stove]]s, and [[vacuum cleaner]]s all became popular from the 1920s through the 1950s. The [[microwave oven]] became popular during the 1980s and have become a standard in all homes by the 1990s. Radios were popularized as a form of entertainment during the 1920s, which extended to television during the 1950s. Cable and satellite television spread rapidly during the 1980s and 1990s. Personal computers began to enter the home during the 1970s–1980s as well. The age of the portable music player grew during the 1960s with the development of the [[transistor radio]], [[Stereo 8|8-track]] and [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] tapes, which slowly began to replace [[gramophone record|record]] players. These were in turn replaced by the CD during the late 1980s and 1990s. The proliferation of the Internet in the mid-to-late 1990s made [[digital distribution]] of music (mp3s) possible. [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]] were popularized in the 1970s, but by the end of the 20th century, DVD players were beginning to replace them, making the VHS obsolete by the end of the first decade of the 21st century.
* The first airplane was flown in 1903.  With the engineering of the faster [[jet engine]] in the 1940s, mass [[air travel]] became commercially viable.
* The [[assembly line]] made mass production of the automobile viable. By the end of the 20th century, billions of people had automobiles for personal transportation.  The combination of the automobile, [[motor boat]]s and air travel allowed for unprecedented personal mobility. In western nations, motor vehicle accidents became the greatest cause of death for young people. However, expansion of [[divided highway]]s reduced the death rate.
* The [[triode|triode tube]], [[transistor]] and [[integrated circuit]] successively revolutionized electronics and computers, leading to the proliferation of the personal computer in the 1980s and cell phones and the public-use Internet in the 1990s.
* New materials, most notably [[stainless steel]], [[Velcro]], [[silicone]], [[polytetrafluoroethylene|teflon]], and [[plastic]]s such as [[polystyrene]], [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[polyethylene]], and [[nylon]] came into widespread use for many various applications. These materials typically have tremendous performance gains in strength, temperature, chemical resistance, or mechanical properties over those known prior to the 20th century.
* [[Aluminum]] became an inexpensive metal and became second only to iron in use. 
* [[Semiconductor]] materials were discovered, and methods of production and purification developed for use in electronic devices. [[Silicon]] became one of the purest substances ever produced. 
* Thousands of [[chemical]]s were developed for industrial processing and home use.

=== Space exploration ===
[[File:Buzz salutes the U.S. Flag.jpg|thumb|American [[Buzz Aldrin]] during the first moonwalk in 1969. The relatively young [[aerospace engineering]] industries rapidly grew in the 66 years after the Wright brothers first flight.]]
* The [[Space Race]] between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] gave a peaceful outlet to the political and military tensions of the [[Cold War]], leading to the first [[human spaceflight]] with the Soviet Union's ''[[Vostok 1]]'' mission in 1961, and man's first landing on another world&amp;mdash;the [[Moon]]&amp;mdash;with America's ''[[Apollo 11]]'' mission in 1969. Later, the first [[space station]] was launched by the [[Soviet space program]]. The United States developed the first reusable spacecraft system with the [[Space Shuttle program]], first launched in 1981. As the century ended, a permanent manned presence in space was being founded with the ongoing construction of the [[International Space Station]].
* In addition to human spaceflight, unmanned space probes became a practical and relatively inexpensive form of exploration. The first orbiting space probe, ''[[Sputnik 1]]'', was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1957. Over time, a massive system of artificial satellites was placed into orbit around Earth. These satellites greatly advanced navigation, communications, military intelligence, geology, climate, and numerous other fields. Also, by the end of the 20th century, unmanned probes had visited the Moon, [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and various asteroids and comets. The [[Hubble Space Telescope]], launched in 1990, greatly expanded our understanding of the Universe and brought brilliant images to TV and computer screens around the world.
* The [[Global Positioning System]], a series of satellites that allow land-based receivers to determine their exact location, was developed and deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/communications/policy/GPS_History.html|title=

== Religion ==
{{see also|List of 20th-century religious leaders}}

* The [[Vatican II]] council was held from 1962 to 1965, and resulted in significant changes in the [[Catholic Church]].
* The [[Wahhabism|Wahhabi]] sect of [[Sunni Islam]] gained in influence with the growth of [[Saudi Arabia]].
* Multiple new religions were founded, including the [[Nation of Islam]], [[Scientology]], and the [[Pentecostalism]] movement.
* [[Atheism]] became considerably more common, both in [[secular]] Western countries, and [[Communist]] countries with a policy of [[state atheism]].

== Economics ==

* The [[Great Depression]] was a worldwide [[economic slowdown]] that lasted throughout the 1930s.
* The [[Soviet Union]] implemented a series of [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] for industrialization and economic development.
* Most countries abandoned the [[gold standard]] for their currency.  The [[Bretton Woods system]] involved currencies being [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] to the [[United States dollar]]; after the system [[Nixon shock|collapsed in 1971]] most major currencies had a [[floating exchange rate]].

[[File:Aeneas James George Mackay Lorimer.jpg|thumb|Aeneas James George Mackay, 1890 drawing]]
'''Aeneas James George Mackay''' (3 November 1839 – 10 June 1911) was a Scottish lawyer and academic, known as a legal and historical writer.

==Life==
[[File:Albyn Place 1-11, Edinburgh.JPG|thumb|280px|Albyn Place, Edinburgh]]
[[File:The grave of Aeneas J G Mackay, St Johns Churchyard, Princes Street, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|280px|The grave of Aeneas J G Mackay, St Johns Churchyard, Princes Street, Edinburgh]]
Born at 7 Albyn Place&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1839&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Moray Estate]] in [[Edinburgh]] on 3 November 1839 and was son of Mary, daughter of John Kirkcaldy of Baldovie, [[Forfarshire]] and Thomas George Mackay, [[writer to the signet]]. He was paternal grandson of Aeneas Mackay, a famous Edinburgh lawyer.

He was educated at [[Edinburgh Academy]] and [[King's College, London]], where he gained distinction in divinity and history. He went on to [[University College, Oxford]], where he graduated BA in 1862, proceeding MA in 1865, and then at [[Heidelberg University]], completing his legal curriculum at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he was one of the first to obtain the degree of LL.B.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Mackay, Æneas James George|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackay was admitted advocate at the Scottish bar in 1864, and attained repute in consultation. He devoted time to studies in law and history, and in 1874 he succeeded [[Cosmo Innes]] as professor of constitutional law and history in the University of Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

In 1881 Mackay was appointed [[advocate-depute]] and resigned the professorship. In 1886 he was made [[Sheriff of Fife and Kinross]], retaining the office till 1901 when failing health compelled him to resign.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Mackay was granted an honorary doctorate (LLD) by [[Edinburgh University]] in 1882, a [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1897,&lt;ref name="gazette-1897-qc"&gt;{{London Gazette | issue = 10915 | date = 3 September 1897 |page=849 | city = Edinburgh }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a fellow of King's College, London. 

He was one of the founders of the [[Scottish History Society]] in 1885, and was an active member of the [[Scottish Text Society]].&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

He died at 7 Albyn Place&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Post Office Directory 1911&lt;/ref&gt;, his birthplace, on 10 June 1911. He is buried with his parents in the churchyard of [[St John's Episcopal Church, Edinburgh]] on [[Princes Street]], very close to his home. The grave lies on the upper burial terrace closest to Princes Street. The grave bears a medallion portrait of his father.

==Works==
Mackay's major work was ''The Practice of the Court of Session'' (2 vols. 1877-9), which became a standard authority. Other works were:&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

* ''Memoir of Sir James Dalrymple of Stair'', 1873. 
* ''William Dunbar: a Study in the Poetry and History of Scotland'', 1889. 
* ''A Sketch of the History of Fife and Kinross'', Cupar Fife, 1890. 
* [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007681468 ''A Century of Scottish Proverbs and Sayings, in Prose and Rhyme, current in Fife''], Cupar Fife, 1891. 
* ''Manual of Practice in the Court of Session'', Edinburgh, 1893. 
* ''A History of Fife and Kinross'' ("County Histories" series), Edinburgh, 1896.

For the Scottish History Society Mackay wrote a life of [[John Major (philosopher)|John Mair]], for [[Archibald Constable]]'s translation of Mair's ''History of Great Britain'' (1892); and for the Scottish Text Society he supplied in 1884 an introduction and appendix for an edition of the ''Poems'' of [[William Dunbar]], and also edited [[Lindsay of Pitscottie]]'s ''Chronicles of Scotland'' in 1899. He wrote articles on Scottish subjects for the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]].'' During the final ten years of his life illness condemned him to inactivity. His last works were connected with the statute law revision for Scotland, for which he prepared an account of pre-Union legislation, issued as a Blue Book.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

==Family==
In 1891 Mackay married Lilian Alina, daughter of Colonel Charles W. St. John, 94th regiment. They had no children.

The '''Africa Centre, London''' was founded in 1964 at 38 King Street, [[Covent Garden]], where over the years it held many art exhibitions, conferences, lectures, and a variety of cultural events, as well as housing a gallery, meeting halls, restaurant, bar and bookshop.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Acheampong, [http://ec.europa.eu/development/body/publications/courier/courier171/en/76_en.pdf "The Africa Centre in London"], ''The Courier'', n° 171, September–October 1998, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; The Africa Centre closed its original venue in 2013, and now has a permanent home at 66 Great Suffolk Street, [[Southwark]]. It is a registered charity.&lt;ref name="charitycommission"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=313510&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0|website=Charity Commission|title=Charity framework |accessdate=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is [[Kenneth Olumuyiwa Tharp]].

==History==
The Africa Centre was opened in 1964 by [[Kenneth Kaunda]] at the [[listed building|Grade II-listed]] 38 King Street.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-20054496 |title=Covent Garden's Africa Centre may become retail premises |publisher=BBC News |date=24 October 2012|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Brown |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/aug/12/africa-centre-london-restoration-plan |title=How London's Africa Centre could be saved &amp;#124; Art and design |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=12 August 2011|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building, which had been a banana warehouse in the 18th century and subsequently an auction house,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=West Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dEgbAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 March 2016|year=1966|publisher=West Africa Publishing Company, Limited|page=1263}}&lt;/ref&gt; was "given by the [[Catholic Church]] in perpetuity to the people of Africa in 1962".&lt;ref name=Dowden&gt;Richard Dowden, [http://africanarguments.org/2011/06/13/saving-the-africa-centre-by-richard-dowden/ "Saving the Africa Centre?"], ''African Arguments'', 13 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FT /&gt;
[[File:King Street, Covent Garden - geograph.org.uk - 480528.jpg|thumbnail|King Street, Covent Garden, 2007]]
The idea for the centre was conceived in 1961 by [[Margaret Feeny]], whose aim (as described by [[Lloyd Bradley]]) was "to foster non-governmental relations between newly independent African nations by bringing people together on neutral apolitical ground. It would also maintain informal cultural links between Britain and her former colonies, while offering a friendly meeting place for Africans living in London."&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd Bradley, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KZAkAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=margaret+feeney+africa+centre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RGONZ4JxVu&amp;sig=fZ0jP61PxxnliPFRBdivU9RP9zk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyq7Hlzc_NAhXkC8AKHcVFBngQ6AEIQzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=margaret%20feeney%20africa%20centre&amp;f=false ''Sounds Like London: 100 Years of Black Music in the Capital''], Serpent's Tail, 2013, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] used to meet [[Thabo Mbeki]] at the bar, and described it as a home "to all who are Africans, and all those who have a care for the interests of the continent and its people".&lt;ref name="theguardian1"/&gt; In the words of [[Richard Dowden]], "it became The Place for African presidents, freedom fighters, writers and artists to speak and debate. You could find everything African there, from Ghanaian food to fierce debates and fantastic parties. Sometimes all three at the same time on a Saturday night; a [[Highlife|High Life]] or Congolese band playing to a crammed floor of dancers while below in the basement radicals and reactionaries sipped pepper soup and argued about evolutionary versus revolutionary change. During the week there were talks about art, African dance lessons, films and plays."&lt;ref name=Dowden /&gt; The [[Association for the Teaching of African and Caribbean Literature]] (ATCAL) was among the influential organisations that used the Africa Centre's facilities, holding its inaugural conference ("How to teach Caribbean and African literature in schools") there in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lee Jasper]], [http://www.obv.org.uk/node/4534 "The Africa Centre to be sold"], OBV (Operation Black Vote), 3 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Centre held frequent exhibitions. ''[[Five Black Women]]'' in 1983, with [[Sonia Boyce]], [[Claudette Johnson]], [[Lubaina Himid]], [[Houria Niati]] and [[Veronica Ryan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://makinghistoriesvisible.com/portfolio/box-9-contents-press-releases-1983-89/ |title=Box 9 Contents – Press Releases 1983–89 |publisher=Making Histories Visible |date= |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dana Arnold|author2=David Peters Corbett|title=A Companion to British Art: 1600 to the Present|date=2016|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405136294|page=305}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; was the first "widely respected" exhibition featuring black women artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.diaspora-artists.net/display_item.php?id=43&amp;table=artists&amp;exhibitionslink=expand |title=Lubaina Himid MBE |website=Diaspora Artists |date= |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the ''London Art and Artists Guide'' described it as a "very lively arts centre" that held classes in dance, movement, and literature, and hosted meetings in the evenings; and The Calabash, London's first African restaurant,&lt;ref name=Craigmyle /&gt; was considered "well worth a visit".&lt;ref name="Waddell2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather Waddell|title=London Art and Artists Guide|chapter=National Centres and Institutes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HVVWi0xIhB0C&amp;pg=PA199|accessdate=14 March 2016|date=November 2005|publisher=London Art and Artists Guide|isbn=978-0-9520004-6-4|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bookshop sold books published only in Africa, as well as "excellent handicrafts and sculpture".&lt;ref name="Inc.1986"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Traveling Life — The Africa Centre|author=Kris DiLorenzo|journal=[[The Crisis]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WyoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA63|accessdate=14 March 2016|date=April 1986|publisher=The Crisis Publishing Company, Inc.|pages=8, 63|volume=93|number=4|issn=0011-1422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Kenneth Olumuyiwa Tharp was appointed to the position of Director of the Africa Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gallery.mailchimp.com/1c381d92d490be92912acd3ea/files/ff1be67d-c048-40a3-b97b-c9be88e6c6f7/Kenneth_appointment_announcement_AC_website.pdf "Kenneth Olumuyiwa Tharp CBE Appointed As Our New Director"], Africa Centre.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giverny Masso, [https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2018/kenneth-olumuyiwa-tharp-named-director-africa-centre-london/ "Kenneth Olumuyiwa Tharp named director of the Africa Centre in London"], ''The Stage'', 10 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/kenneth-tharp-announced-new-director-africa-centre "Kenneth Tharp Announced As New Director Of The Africa Centre"], ''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'', 10 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Move of premises===
In August 2012, the building at 38 King Street was sold to the property developer [[Capital &amp; Counties Properties|Capital &amp; Counties]] for an estimated £12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt;&lt;ref name="wordpress1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://savetheafricacentre.wordpress.com/ |title=The blog of the Save The Africa Centre Campaign |website=Savetheafricacentre.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was despite a concerted campaign to save the Centre at its original premises, supported by Desmond Tutu, [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Ngugi Wa Thiong'o]], [[Yinka Shonibare]], [[Bonnie Greer]], [[Sokari Douglas Camp]] and others.&lt;ref name=FT&gt;William Wallis, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/77411548-ad5f-11e0-bc4f-00144feabdc0.html "Battle for London’s African heart"], ''[[Financial Times]]'', 15 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordpress1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chipo Chung]], [https://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/chipo-chung/africa-centre-politics-microcosm-of-failed-democracy "Africa Centre politics: microcosm of failed democracy"], ''Open Democracy'', 18 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the sale of the King Street building, the Centre moved to 66 Great Suffolk Street in [[Southwark]], where it now resides permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.london-se1.co.uk/news/view/8329|title=Africa Centre plans new home in Great Suffolk Street|work=London SE1|date=15 June 2015|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Africa Centre maintains a link with Covent Garden by having an annual Summer Festival in August on the [[Covent Garden#Covent Garden Piazza|Piazza]], since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newafricanmagazine.com/still-saving-the-africa-centre/ "Still saving the Africa Centre"], ''New African'', 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africacentrefestival.com/ |title=The Africa Centre Summer Festival 2015 |website=Africacentrefestival.com |date=1 August 2015 |accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Al-Asmaʿi''' ({{lang|ar|أبو سعيد عبد الملك ابن قريب الأصمعي}}, ''ʿAbd al-Malik ibn Quraib (Qurayb) as-Aṣmaʿī ''; {{refn|group=n|Khallikān (II, 123)}} {{circa|lk=no|740}}-828/833 CE), or '''Asmai'''. He was an early [[Arabic grammar|grammarian]] and one of the [[Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala'|three leading]] Arabic grammarians of the [[Grammarians of Basra|Basra school]].{{snf|Versteegh|p=110}}{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|p=78}}{{sfn|Versteegh|loc=Ar. Linguistic Trad.|p=25}}  The great philologist and grammarian to the court of [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn al-Rashīd]], he was celebrated as a scholar of poetry and a pioneer of [[natural science]] and [[zoology]]{{snf|Alkhateeb|p=132}}. A prolific author and polymath, he wrote on a range of topics from grammar and genealogy to zoology, and the scientific studies on animal and human [[anatomy]] which he conducted.  He was credited with composing an epic on the life of [[Antarah ibn Shaddad]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} He was a protégé of [[Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi]] and [[Abu 'Amr ibn al-'Ala']], and a contemporary and rival of [[Abu Ubaidah (scholar)|Abū ʿUbaidah]] and [[Sibawayhi]] of the Basra school.{{sfn|Chejne|p=43}}{{sfn|Carter|p=22}}

The tenth century biography Al-Aṣma’ī comes through Isḥaq [[al-Nadim|al-Nadīm]], who uses the narrative method known as “[[isnad]]” or ‘chain of transmission’ tradition. Al Nadīm had read the written account of Abū ‘Abd Allāh ibn Muqlah{{refn|group=n|al-Ḥasan ibn ‘Ali ibn Muqlah, Abī ‘Abd Allāh; brother of the vizier of [[al-Muqtadir]] and [[al-Qahir|al-Qāhir]], Muḥammad ibn ‘Alī, calligrapher{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=III|p=266}}}} who himself was reporting Abū al-‘Abbas Tha‘lab’s report{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=I|p=83}}, which gave Al-Aṣma’ī‘s full name to be ‘’’‘Abd al-Malik ibn Qurayb ibn ‘Abd al-Malik ibn ‘Ali ibn Aṣma’ī ibn Muẓahhir ibn ‘Amr ibn ‘Abd Allah al-Bāhilī.’’’

In the thirteenth century the celebrated biographer [[Ibn Khallikān|Ibn Khallikān]] provided a more elaborate account telling several of the numerous adventures and anecdotes he collected.  Khallikān calls him “a complete master of the Arabic language,” and “the most eminent of all transmitters of the oral history and rare expressions of the language.”{{sfn|Adamec|p=43}}{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|pp=123}}

==Biography==

Al-Aṣma’ī was born and probably died in Basra{{refn|group=n|Al-Nadīm and Khallikān both cite Basra, however Khallikān reports a disputed claim that he died in [[Merv]], (now in [[Turkmenistan]]). Other sources claim he died at [[Baghdad]]. {{sfn|Adamec}}{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p125}}}}, some said in 213 AH / 828-829 CE, others in 217 AH / 832-833 CE {{sfn|Dodge|p=121}} and Khatīb Abū Bakr said he was aged 88 years. {{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p125}}

His father was Qurayb Abū Bakr from ‘Āṣim and his son was Sa’īd.  He belonged to the family of the celebrated poet Abū ‘Uyaynah al-Muhallabī.{{refn|group=n|Abū ibn Muḥammad ibn Abi ‘Uyaynah (late 8th -early 9th  century).{{sfn|Iṣbahānī|loc=pt XVIII|p=9}}}}{{sfn|Dodge|p=361}}  His nephew, ‘Abd al- Raḥmān Abū Muḥammad Abū al-Ḥasan, who also wrote, was average as author, but reliably transmitted his uncle’s work. {{sfn|Dodge|p=121}}

Al-Aṣma’ī was descended from [[Adnan|Adnān]]{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p123}}  and the tribe of [[Bahila]].{{sfn|Caskel|p=921}}  The governor of Basra brought him to the notice of caliph al-Rashid, who made him tutor to his sons [[Al-Amin]] and [[Al-Ma'mun]].{{sfn|Carter|p=22}}  Al-Rashid, an insomniac, was said to have once held an all-night discussion with al-Asmaʿi on pre-Islamic and early Arabic poetry.{{sfn|Ouyang|p=81}} Al-Aṣma’ī was popular with the influential [[Barmakids|Barmakid]] viziers {{sfn|Merriam-Webster|p=78}} and acquired wealth as a property owner in Basra.{{sfn|Thatcher|p=763}} Some of his protégés attained high rank as literary men.{{sfn|Thatcher|loc=I|p=763}}

His ambitious aim to catalogue the complete Arabic language in its purest form, led to a period he spent roaming with desert Bedouin tribes, observing and recording their speech patterns.{{sfn|Chejne|p=43}}

==Rivalry between Al-Aṣma’ī and Abū ‘Ubaida==

His great critic Abū ʿUbaidah was a member of the [[Shu'ubiyya]] movement, a chiefly Persian cultural movement. Al-Aṣma’ī, as an Arab nationalist and champion of the Arabic language, rejected foreign linguistic and literary influences.

Al-Nadīm reports that Abū ‘Ubaida had said that al-Aṣma’ī claimed his father travelled on a horse of Salm ibn Qutaybah.{{refn|group=n|Salm ibn Qutaybah ibn Muslim al-Bāhilī. (d.766); governor of al-Baṣrah and later of al-Rayy during the reign of [[al-Mansur|al-Manṣūr]].{{sfn|Ṭabārī|loc=III. II|pp=326-27}}{{sfn|Ziriklī|loc=III|p=168}}}}  Abū ‘Ubaida had exclaimed,

:“Praise be to Allāh and thanks to Allāh, for Allāh is greater [than His creatures]. One boasting of what he does not own is like a person wearing a false robe and, by Allāh the father of al-Aṣma’ī never owned any animal other than the one inside of his robe!"

Ubaida’s reference here to al-Asma’ī’s father seems to relate to the story given by Khallikān of al-Asma’ī’s grandfather, Alī ibn Asmā who had lost his fingers as the punishment for theft.{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p=125}}

A corollary to 'Ubaida’s anecdote is related by Khallikān, that once [[al-Fadl Ibn Rabi |al-Faḍl Ibn Rabī]], the vizier to caliph al-Rashid, had brought forth his horse and asked both Al-Aṣma’ī and Abū 'Ubaida (who had written extensively on the horse) to identify each part of its anatomy. Abū 'Ubaida excused himself from the challenge, saying that he was an expert on Bedouin culture not a farrier; When al-Aṣma’ī then grabbed the horse by the mane, named each part of its body while, at the same time, reciting the Bedouin verses that authenticated each term as proper to the Arabic lexicon, Al-Faḍl had rewarded him the horse.  Whenever after this, Aṣma’ī visited Ubaida he rode his horse. {{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p124}}  Al-Aṣma’ī, was a perennial bachelor and when Yahya, a [[Barmakid]] vizier of the caliph, presented him with the gift of  a slave girl, the girl was so repulsed by Al-Aṣma’ī's appearance, Yahya bought her back.{{sfn|Adamec|p=43}}

Shaykh Abū Sa’īd reported that Abū al-‘Abbas al-Mubarrad had said al-Aṣma’ī and Abū ‘Ubaida were equal in poetry and rhetoric, but where Abū ‘Ubaida excelled in genealogy, al-Aṣma’ī excelled in grammar – “al-Aṣma’ī, [like] a nightingale [would] charm them with his melodies”{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p=124}}

Al-Aṣma’ī’s funeral was attended by the blind poet satirist Abū al-[[‘Aynā]] Muḥammad ibn al-Qāsim{{refn|group=n| He lived at Baghdad died at al-Basrah in 895/896. {{sfn|Mas‘udi|loc=VIII|pp=120-25}}{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=III|p=56}}}} who related that “Allāh invoked al-Faḍl ibn Abi Isḥaq on his behalf, and ‘Abd al-Raḥmān, his nephew, recited the prayers saying, ‘What does it matter to him who is called home, after what Allāh has revealed to him?’"

===Works{{refn|group=n|Cf. Flügel, Gram. Schulen, p. 78.}}===

Of Asmaʿi's works listed in the ''[[Fihrist]]'' about half a dozen are extant. These include the ''Book of Distinction'', the ''Book of the Wild Animals'', the ''Book of the Horse'', and the ''Book of the Sheep'', and ''Fuḥūlat al-Shu‘arā''  a pioneering work of Arabic literary criticism.{{sfn|Van Gelder|p=2}}

Most existing collections of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry were compiled by al-Asmaʿi's students based on the principles he taught.{{sfn|Merriam-Webster|p=78}} In the modern era, German Orientalist [[Wilhelm Ahlwardt]] collected and republished al-Asmaʿi's magnum opus [[Asma'iyyat]], considered to be one of the primary sources of early Arabic poetry.{{sfn|Nasser|p=210}}

==Contribution to Early Arabic Literature==

Al-Aṣma’ī was among a group of scholars who edited and recited the [[Jahiliyyah|Pre-lslāmic]] and Islāmic poets of the Arab tribes up to the era of the [[Abbasid|Banū al-‘Abbās]]{{refn|group=n|For translations of some of these ancient poems, {{sfn|Mufaḍḍal, Mufaḍḍalīyāt (Lyall) and Tammām, Al-Ḥamāsah.}}}}{{sfn|Dodge|p=344}}

He memorised thousands of verses of rajaz poetry{{sfn|Khallikān|loc=II|p=124}} and edited a substantial portion of the canon of Arab poets, but produced little poetry of his own. {{sfn|Dodge|p=361}}.  He met criticism for neglecting the ‘rare forms’ (nawādir  - {{lang|ar|نوادر}}) and lack of care in his abridgments.{{refn|group=n|note on various translation in Flügel and Beatty MS.{{sfn|Dodge|pp=119-121}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1909">'''Anatoly Petrovich Novoseltsev''' (Анатолий Петрович Новосельцев; 1933, [[Irkutsk]] – 1995) was a [[Russia]]n [[Oriental studies|orientalist]] who brought to light and translated into Russian a slew of obscure [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Arab]] documents relating to the early history of [[Kievan Rus]]'.

Together with [[Vladimir Pashuto]] he authored ''The Foreign Policy of Ancient Rus'' (1968), a groundbreaking study that demonstrated that Rus' had been as active in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Central Asia]] as it had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apnovoselcev.narod.ru/text/b/b01.html Т. М. Калинина, Е. А. Мельникова, И. И. Попов. Анатолий Петрович Новосельцев (1933—1995) // Древнейшие государства Восточной Европы, 1998. М., 2000.]&lt;/ref&gt; He later published a sketch of the history of [[Khazaria]] and opposed the [[Anti-Normanist]] dogma perpetuated in the official Soviet historiography inter alia by [[Boris Rybakov]].

Novoseltsev was elected a corresponding member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ras.ru/win/db/show_per.asp?P=.id-51547.ln-ru.dl-.pr-inf.uk-12&lt;/ref&gt; He managed the Russian History Institute, affiliated with the Academy of Sciences, between 1988 and 1993. He was succeeded by [[Andrey Nikolayevich Sakharov]].

'''André Duchesne''' ({{IPA-fr|dyʃɛːn|lang}}; sometimes spelled ''Du Chesne'', [[Latin]]ized ''Andreas Chesneus'', ''Andreas Quercetanus'', or ''Andreas Querneus''; May 1584{{snd}}May 30, 1640) was a [[France|French]] geographer and historian, generally styled the father of French history.

Duchesne was born in [[L'Île-Bouchard]].  He was educated at [[Loudun]] and afterwards at Paris. From his earliest years he devoted himself to historical and geographical research, and his first work, ''Egregiarum seu selectarum lectionum et antiquitatum liber'', published in his eighteenth year, displayed great erudition. He enjoyed the patronage of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], a native of the same district with himself, through whose influence he was appointed historiographer and geographer to the king.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Du Chesne, André|volume=8|page=629}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Paris]] in 1640, in consequence of having been run over by a carriage when on his way from the city to his country house at [[Verrières-le-Buisson|Verrières]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Works==
[[File:Histoire généalogique de la maison de Montmorency et de Laval par André Du Chesne.jpg|thumb|André Duchesne, ''Histoire généalogique de la maison de Montmorency et de Laval'' (1624)]]
Duchesne's works were very numerous and varied, and in addition to what he published, he left behind him more than 100 folio volumes of manuscript extracts now preserved in the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]] ([[L. Delisle]], ''Le Cabinet des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque impériale'', t. L, 333–334). Several of his larger works were continued by his only son [[François Duchesne]] (1616–1693), who succeeded him in the office of historiographer to the king.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The principal works of André Duchesne are ''Les Antiquités et recherches de la grandeur et majesté des rois de France'' (Paris, 1609), ''Les Antiquités et recherches des villes, châteaux, &amp;c., de toute la France'' (Paris, 1609), ''Histoire d'Angleterre, d'Ecosse, et d'Irelande'' (Paris, 1614), ''Histoire des Papes jusqu'à Paul V'' (Paris, 1619), ''Histoire des rois, ducs, et comtes de Bourgogne'' (1619–1628, 2 vols. fol.), ''Historiae Normanorum scriptores antiqui'' (1619, fol., now the only source for some of the texts), and his ''Historiae Francorum scriptores'' (5 vols. fol., 1636–1649).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

This last was intended to comprise 24 volumes, and to contain the narrative sources for French history in the Middle Ages; only two volumes were published by the author, his son François published three more, and the work remained unfinished. Besides these Duchesne published a great number of genealogical histories of illustrious families, of which the best is that of the house of [[Montmorency family|Montmorency]]. His ''Histoire des cardinaux francais'' (2 vols. 101. 1660–1666) and ''Histoire des chanceliers et gardes des sceaux de France'' (1630) were published by his son François. André also published a translation of the [[Satires of Juvenal]], and editions of the works of [[Alcuin]], [[Abelard]], [[Alain Chartier]] and [[Étienne Pasquier]].

The '''Apollo insurance covers''' are [[autograph]]ed [[postal cover]]s signed by the astronaut crews prior to their mission. The insurance covers began with Apollo 11 and ended with Apollo 16. The ability of astronauts to obtain much life insurance was limited, so they signed hundreds of postal covers before they left, on the presumption that they would become highly valuable in the event of their death. The crew would designate a trusted ally with the covers who would then have them [[Cancellation (mail)|cancelled]] at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) post office on the day of launch and/or on the day of the lunar landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/view/9097559|title= Apollo Insurance Covers | publisher = picturetrail.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/neil-armstrong-couldnt-afford-life-insurance-so-this-would-have-taken-care-of-his-family-if-he-died-2012-8|title=Neil Armstrong Couldn't Afford Life Insurance, So He Used A Creative Way To Provide For His Family If He Died|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=Aug 30, 2012|author=Robert Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollo 11 insurance covers normally fetch the highest prices because it was the first lunar landing mission.

There are three varieties of the Apollo 11 covers, four of Apollo 12, two of Apollo 13, two of Apollo 14, one of Apollo 15 and one of Apollo 16. Some astronauts also left behind single signed covers for their families.
[[File:Alan Bean’s Apollo 12 Insurance Cover.jpg|thumb|Alan Bean’s Apollo 12 Insurance Cover, postmarked Nov. 14th 1969 and signed by Charles Conrad, Richard Gordon and Alan Bean]]
The two producers of the mission covers were The Manned Spacecraft Center Stamp Club in Houston, Texas (the MSCSC Covers) and a friend of the astronauts, Al Bishop (the "Bishop Covers"). Especially in the case of the MSCSC Covers, there are many of the exact covers that the stamp collectors also obtained through the club. These were also crew signed, but many after the mission, which makes them not an insurance cover. The essence of a true Insurance Cover is the fact that it was signed while in quarantine prior to launch and that it was one of those that were left behind for the crew families in the event of disaster.
In order to be certain that a cover is a genuine Insurance Cover, it must originate from one of the crew members or their families. Ideally, the reverse of the cover should be certified by one of the crew.
[[File:Buzz Aldrin’s Apollo 11 Insurance Cover.jpg|thumb|Buzz Aldrin’s Apollo 11 Insurance Cover, postmarked July 20th 1969 and signed by Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin]]
Although flown artifacts from the Apollo missions are normally the most desirable objects for collectors, Insurance Covers have become highly popular because they truly display all that a collector would want from a mission; a beautiful design which normally included the mission emblem, a postal cancellation of the day of launch, authentic vintage signatures of the crew prior to the launch, and a certification attesting to its authenticity.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5339">The '''Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress''' ('''AMCP''') is located in the city of [[Agats]], in the [[Papua province]] of [[Indonesia]]. It was conceived by the Catholic Crosier missionary [[Frank Trenkenschuh]] in 1969 as a way to preserve traditional [[Asmat people|Asmat]] art as well as provide economic outlets to the Asmat people.  It was built by the Catholic Crosier Diocese of Agats-Asmat, which also owns the museum, and supported by Crosier Fathers and Brothers Bishop Alphonse Sowada, originally from [[Elmdale, Minnesota]], US.&lt;ref name="Crosier Bishop Sowada and Diocesan Art Museum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mission.stcdio.org/mission-office-homepage/global-solidarity/global-connections/papua/ | title=The late Bishop Alphonse Sowada: 40 years of missionary service; Crosiers and the Asmat; Asmat Museum: Preservation of a People | publisher=Catholic Diocese of Saint Cloud Mission Office | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMAA@UST"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://art.stthomas.edu/asmat/about-the-museum | title=AMAA@UST | publisher=St. Thomas University, St. Paul, MN, US | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American artist [[Tobias Schneebaum]] and Ursula and Gunter Konrad helped in establishing the museum and it officially opened on August 17, 1973.&lt;ref name="Asmat History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holmes.anthropology.museum/asmat/history.html |title=Asmat History |publisher=Lowell D.

The museum has catalogued approximately 1,200 items to its collection.&lt;ref name="SCHN"&gt;{{cite book |title=Asmat Images |last=Schneebaum |first=Tobias |publisher=Crosier Mission Press |year=1985 |isbn=0-918728-59-2}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 600 are on display, including over 300 sculptural pieces, ancestor poles, shields, and drums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Asmat: Perception of Life in Art: The Collection of the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress |publisher=K.

Later, upon retiring to his native [[St. Cloud, Minnesota|St. Cloud]], MN, US area, Bishop emeritus Sowada was also instrumental in founding a second Asmat museum, the [[American Museum of Asmat Art]] which opened in 1995 at the [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], [[Minnesota]], where it also appears under the acronyms AMAA and AMAA@UST.&lt;ref name="AMAA@UST"/&gt;

The director of the Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress, as of 2007, has been Eric Sarkol with John Ohoiwirin as assistant.

Building upon a 1968-1974 [[United Nations]] funded Asmat wood carving project, the museum hosts an annual woodcarving competition and auction. The 31st Asmat Culture Festival sponsored by the Museum was scheduled for 8–13 October 2015.&lt;ref name="Asmat History"/&gt;&lt;ref name="31st Asmat Culture Festival sponsored by the Museum"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/359194677580073/photos/a.359210410911833.1073741828.359194677580073/471125063053700/?type=1&amp;theater | title=31st Asmat Culture Festival sponsored by the Museum | publisher=Asmat Museum of Culture and Progress | accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Burak Eldem''' (born 1961) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] writer/researcher, a former radio and TV programmer, web developer and journalist. He is the author of "2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk" (also known as ''2012: Appointment With Marduk'' - 2003), ''Fraternis: Lost Books, Secret Brotherhood'' (2006) and ''Talismans Protect Thee'' (2004). The first two titles belong to a trilogy about the history of civilization, which he named "The Hidden History". The latter is a science-fiction novel on immortality, ancient secrets and international conspiracies. His latest work ''Sunset Fandango'', sequel to "Talismans", was published in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Turkish edition: "Gunbatimi Fandango" by Inkilap Publishing - November 2007... 536 pages... {{ISBN|978-975-10-2640-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and journalism==
Eldem spent his early childhood in Ankara, the capital of Turkey. His father, Atilla Eldem, was a well-known actor of the Ankara State Theatre and his mother was a high school literature teacher. He is also a great-grandson of [[İbrahim Edhem Pasha]], [[Grand Vizier]] (Sadrazam) of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Abdulhamid II]].  Eldem moved to Istanbul in 1975 when his father died and continued his high school education in this city. Graduated from [[Boğaziçi University]]'s Tourism Management department and then [[Marmara University]]'s Business Administration Faculty, but never intended to be a business executive;&lt;ref&gt;From his biography at his official web site {{cite web |url=http://en.burakeldem.com/content/view/12/26/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809153607/http://en.burakeldem.com/content/view/12/26/ |archivedate=2006-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; his main interests were writing and history.

His journalism career began in 1984, writing feature articles for Turkish arts and culture magazines; among them were "Gösteri", "Sanat Olayı" and "Milliyet Sanat", the most popular publications of the early eighties. His writings mostly concentrated on post-[[World War II]] counter-culture movements in Western World, particularly the avant-garde literature of the fifties and particularly in rock music. His colorful analysis on the [[Beat Generation]] literature and the [[Flower Power]] movement of the sixties, were welcomed by young urban intellectuals. In 1985, his first book was published by Imge Publications, titled "[[Bob Marley]] and [[Reggae]]"; a biography of Jamaican reggae star and a summary of the [[Rastafarian]] movement, slightly emphasising its politics, its elements of [[anti-imperialism]]. The same year he published "The History of Rock Music"; a research on the roots of jazz, blues and rock music, as a sociological and political phenomenon of the twentieth century capitalist world.

Eldem was among the founders of the monthly music and counter-culture magazine "Studyo Imge"  (now considered as a cult)&lt;ref&gt;Studyo Imge is now being published only as an online electronic magazine - see http://www.studyoimge.com&lt;/ref&gt; and became its first editor in early 1985. In 1986, his third book came: "From May Flower to the Song of Peace"; a work on American protest folk music of sixties, centered around the singer [[Joan Baez]]. The same year he began to write for the daily newspaper Cumhuriyet (The Republic) and became its one of the most popular freelance writers. In early 1988, he was hired for Playboy magazine's Turkish edition as the editorial director and ran that position until 1990. Between 1991-96, he prepared and presented documentary music programs for Turkish television (TRT).

In 1997, he shifted his career towards "new media" working as a contributing editor and a columnist at [[ZDNet]]'s Turkish edition; then in 2000, he became the portal manager of the leading internet content provider and ISP "Ixir". He also ran a personal web site named "Atlantis", where he shared his research on humanities and particularly on ancient history.

Eldem has published dozens of articles and essays on archaeo-astronomy, along with unorthodox interpretations of sacred texts and papyri. His writings on ancient [[Mesopotamian]] [[cosmology]] and [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] [[astronomy]] eventually became the basis and nucleus of a trilogy, named "The Hidden History". The first volume was published in 2003: the best-selling "2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk".&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Edition: "2012: Marduk'la Randevu" by Inkilap Publishing - July 2003... 608 pages... {{ISBN|975-10-1999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examining, adapting and developing the work of [[Zecharia Sitchin]], the book refers to the hypothetical [[Nibiru cataclysm|Planet X]], and suggests an orbital period of 3661 solar years with a return date in 2012. Eldem also suggests that the number 3661 was written as "three wedges" with cuneiform in Mesopotamian [[sexagesimal]] mathematics: One wedge each for 3600's, 60's and units digits. This [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] sign, claims Eldem, was misinterpreted by Jewish exiles in [[Babylon]] and the enigmatic [[666 (number)|666]] was created: the [[Number of the Beast (numerology)|Number of the Beast]] was actually the number of solar years in [[Nibiru (hypothetical planet)|Marduk]]'s orbital period.

The book became a best-seller in Turkey in 2004 and Eldem was criticized by religious writers for being an atheist, denying the Old Testament prophets such as Moses, promoting the theory of evolution, accusing Moses and Aaron of inventing the concept of God in order to reassure themselves following natural disasters such as floods.&lt;ref&gt;Serdar Kuru in {{cite web |url=http://www.guvercinevi.net/yazilar.asp?ID%3D763%26h%3D1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040925212023/http://guvercinevi.net/yazilar.asp?ID=763&amp;h=1 |archivedate=2004-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, his works had very positive critics from some of the outstanding writers and journalists of the Turkish Press, like Engin Ardıç&lt;ref&gt;See, Star (daily newspaper), July 27, 2003, page 2, Engin Ardıç's column (http://www.stargazete.com/index.asp?haberID=30922)&lt;/ref&gt; and Serdar Turgut,&lt;ref&gt;See Serdar Turgut's 3 consequent articles in Akşam, on March 25, 26th and 29th 2004 (http://www.aksam.com.tr/arsiv/aksam/2004/03/26/yazarlar/yazarlar210.html)&lt;/ref&gt; the editor-in-chief of daily newspaper ''[[Akşam]]'' (The Evening). Ardıç, a very popular writer, columnist and former TV commentator, also contributed to "2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk" by writing its foreword.&lt;ref&gt;Engin Ardıç's foreword to "2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk" can be found online at Eldem's official site (in Turkish) {{cite web |url=http://2012.burakeldem.com/content/view/5/52/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220083835/http://2012.burakeldem.com/content/view/5/52/ |archivedate=2007-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year came his first novel, ''Seni Tılsımlar Korur'' "Talismans Protect Thee";&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Edition: "Seni Tilsimlar Korur" by Inkilap Publishing - November 2004... 581 pages... {{ISBN|975-10-2233-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a semi-fantastic fiction on immortality, a five thousand years old dark secret which had been hidden from humanity, a dark international conspiracy and a top secret research on human DNA. "Talismans" became one of the best-selling novels of 2005 in Turkey.

Eldem's second book of "The Hidden History" trilogy, ''[[Fraternis: Lost Books, Secret Brotherhood]]''&lt;ref&gt;Turkish Edition: "Fraternis: Kayip Kitaplar, Gizli Kardeslik" by Inkilap Publishing - April 2006... 640 pages... {{ISBN|975-10-2439-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in April 2006. "Fraternis" focuses on alleged lost records of ancient wisdom; a mysterious, legendary collection of writings, traces of which he says can be found under various names like "The [[Sibylline Books]]", "Corpus [[Hermetica]]" or "The Lost Books of [[Phoenicians]]".

Eldem prepared an eight-days article series&lt;ref&gt;See Akşam,  {{cite web |url=http://www.aksam.com.tr/arsiv/aksam/2005/04/03/yazidizi/yazidizi1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721154839/http://www.aksam.com.tr/arsiv/aksam/2005/04/03/yazidizi/yazidizi1.html |archivedate=2006-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2005 for the daily newspaper Akşam, which presented a mini summary of "2012: Rendez-vous With Marduk". Since then, he publishes his articles only at his official website and once in a month contributes to the online magazine "Derki".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2873">'''Busi Kheswa''' is an oral historian as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) activist from [[South Africa]]. She is most notable for directing the Forum for the Empowerment of Women (FEW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mambaonline.com/article.asp?artid=2145|date=2008-07-15|title=Gay Soweto|author=Cindy Coulter|accessdate=2012-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; FEW works to promote and protect the rights of LBT women in South Africa.

==Career==

Kheswa is a member in multiple organizations that are involved in LGBT rights in South Africa, including the Gay and Lesbian Archives (GALA) and [[Lesbian and Gay Equality Project]] (LGEP) as well as FEW. GALA is an organization that records the struggles and histories of LGBT South Africans, and uses their stories for documentaries which challenge homophobia and promote gay rights. Kheswa was in charge of acquiring histories for the visual collections put together by GALA, as well as contributing to public education projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Out In Africa Bio|url=http://www.oia.co.za/october-2011-festival/guests/|work=Online Databse|publisher=Out in Africa|accessdate=2012-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The LGEP is an activists group that works on improving the legislation to ensure the freedom of LGBT South Africans.

As a director for the FEW foundation, Kheswa's work has been instrumental in lobbying for protection against hate crimes, including [[corrective rape]]s against women, which happen routinely and often go unpunished, despite being in opposition to South African law which states that LGBT people have fair and equal rights. Women often face physical torture, rape, and even death, as was the case of professional football player [[Eudy Simelane]] who was stabbed 25 times and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2055289/Corrective-rape-South-Africa-women-attcked-cure-lesbians.html |date=2011-10-31 |author= Liz Hazelton| title=Raped for being gay: Scourge of South African sex attacks which men claim will 'cure' woman of being lesbian|accessdate= 2012-02-01|location=London|work=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FEW was established in 2002 in Johannesburg, and uses a variety of tools to increase the recognition of gay rights including leadership programs to encourage people to stand up for themselves and their communities, organization of campaigns that lobby for hate crime legislation, and health rights projects.

==Personal life==
Kheswa is also an elder at Hope and Unity Metropolitan Community Church, which is Africa's first openly gay congregation.

===Marriage, Laguna Gloria and divorce===

On July 31, 1906,&lt;ref name="Clara Driscoll"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeMoss|first=Dorothy D.|title=Clara Driscoll|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fdr04|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clara married [[Tennessee]]-born&lt;ref name="Henry Hulme (Hal) Sevier"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeMoss|first=Dorothy D.|title=Henry Hulme Sevier|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fse12|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historial Association|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hal H. Sevier|Henry Hulme Sevier]] in [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]].&lt;ref name="Henry Hulme Sevier (1878-1940)"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kestenbaum|first=Lawrence|title=Henry Hulme Sevier (1878–1940)|url=http://politicalgraveyard.com/geo/TN/banking.html|publisher=The Political Graveyard|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple honeymooned in [[Europe]] and settled in the Sevier villa on [[Long Island]]. When Robert Driscoll Sr. died in 1914, the Seviers returned to Texas to be involved in the Driscoll family business.&lt;ref name="Clara Driscoll"/&gt; In 1917, Hal Sevier founded the ''[[Austin American-Statesman]]''.

Hal remembered his wife's fondness for [[Lake Como]] in [[Italy]] during their honeymoon, and sought to give her the Texas version.  In August 1915, they bought 28 ½ acres on [[Lake Austin]] at [[Mount Bonnell]] overlooking the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] five miles (8&amp;nbsp;km) west of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].  The land had originally been purchased by [[Stephen F. Austin]] who died before he could develop it.  They chose the name [[Laguna Gloria]],&lt;ref name="Clara Driscoll: An American Tradition"&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Martha Anne|title=Clara Driscoll: An American Tradition |year=1980|publisher=Madrona Press|isbn=978-0-89052-025-3|pages=56–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Clara supervised the development of the estate and construction of the 15-room mansion,&lt;ref name="Historic American Buildings Survey-Historic American Engineering Record"&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic American Buildings Survey-Historic American Engineering Record|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=pphhsheet&amp;fileName=tx/tx1000/tx1001/sheet/browse.db&amp;action=browse&amp;recNum=0&amp;title2=Laguna%20Gloria,%203809%20West%20Thirty-Fifth%20Street,%20Austin,%20Travis,%20TX&amp;displayType=1&amp;maxCols=2|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which became Clara's showplace for entertaining visitors from around the world.

From 1922–1926, university student Mary Lubbock Lasswell&lt;ref name="Clara Driscoll Rescued the Alamo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butterfield|first=Jack C|title=Clara Driscoll Rescued the Alamo|year=1961|id=ASIN: B0007EXDGM  |publisher=The Library Committee, Daughters of the Republic of Texas|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; became a frequent visitor to Laguna Gloria. Mary described Clara as a magnetic personality with reddish-black hair and brown eyes, and who was ''"exceedingly outspoken"''.  Lasswell remembered that both the Seviers were fond of Mexican and Spanish songs. Mary likened Clara to ''"an eagle among a flock of [[pouter|pouter pigeons]]"''.

Clara closed Laguna Gloria&lt;ref name="Clara Driscoll"/&gt; when her brother died in 1929 and the Seviers returned to the Palo Alto ranch headquarters. Clara managed the family's businesses and became president of Corpus Christi Bank and Trust Company.

In 1933, President Franklin Roosevelt appointed Hal Sevier as ambassador extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary to [[Chile]]. In 1935, the couple became legally separated. They never had any children. The couple divorced on July 7, 1937&lt;ref name="Clara Driscoll"/&gt; and Clara resumed the use of her maiden name.

===Saving the Alamo===

Driscoll returned from Europe in 1898&lt;ref name="A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Randy|title=A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory |year=2002|publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0-7432-1233-5 |pages=207–229, 277–280, 308, 310, 338, 339, 351|author2=Olson|editor=James S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and settled in San Antonio. She was alarmed at the state of the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]], stating her opinion in the ''San Antonio Express'' that "unsightly obstructions" near the Alamo should be removed to allow the Alamo to stand alone.

The public entrance known as the Alamo's mission chapel was already owned by the [[State of Texas]], which had purchased the building from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in 1883 and had given custody to the City of San Antonio. The city had made no improvements to the chapel structure and ownership did not include the long barracks (convento).

In 1903, [[Adina Emilia De Zavala]] enlisted Clara Driscoll to join the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]] and chair the De Zavala fund raising committee to negotiate the purchase of the long barracks that was owned by wholesale grocers Charles Hugo, Gustav Schmeltzer and William Heuermann.&lt;ref&gt;d̪&lt;/ref&gt;  The asking price was $75,000,&lt;ref name="A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory"/&gt; most of which came out of Clara Driscoll's bank account. On January 26, 1905, the state legislature approved and [[S. W. T. Lanham|Governor S.W.T Lanham]] signed legislation for state funding to preserve the Alamo property. The state reimbursed Clara Driscoll and on October 4, 1905, the governor formally conveyed the Alamo property, including the convento and the mission church, to the Daughters of the Republic of Texas.

A divide between two factions erupted over how the long barracks property was to be used.  Driscoll and others&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Reeves to the San Antonio Business Men’s Club, August 30, 1906, De Zavala Papers&lt;/ref&gt;  believed it was not part of the original structure and should be turned into a park.  Clara offered to raze the building at her own expense. De Zavala was adamant that the long barracks was part of the original building and where the major part of the battle had occurred. In 1908, De Zavala had a stand-off with authorities inside the structure. By 1911, [[Oscar Branch Colquitt|Governor Oscar Branch Colquitt]]&lt;ref name="Adina de Zavala to Governor O.B. Colquitt, August 25, 1911 "&gt;{{cite web|title=Adina de Zavala to Governor O.B. Colquitt, August 25, 1911 |url=http://www.tsl.state.tx.us/governors/rising/colquitt-alamo-1.html|publisher=Texas State Library and Archives Commission|accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the long barracks be restored to its original condition as it was in mission days. During the 1912 restoration,&lt;ref&gt;San Antonio Express, January 25 and 26, 1912, February 4, 1912&lt;/ref&gt; workers discovered foundation work that verified De Zavala's instincts that the structure had indeed been an original part of the Alamo. However, Governor Colquitt was eventually unsuccessful in preserving the barracks building&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drtl.org/Research/Alamo4.asp Daughters of the Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; and when out of town on business the Lieutenant Governor [[William Harding Mayes]] allowed for the further removal of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iDFd_1yaAdgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;lpg=PA214&amp;dq=william+harding+mayes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MBYQCC3QbC&amp;sig=pkfC4uKsSAItWubb3A7NG5PJCNA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gzXsVPGHA8OgNuWsgsgJ&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwDg#v=onepage&amp;q=william%20harding%20mayes&amp;f=false A Line in the Sand p. 214]&lt;/ref&gt; Driscoll then succeeded in obtaining an injunction preventing the state from initiating any reconstruction work of the convent and a case was upheld on appeal, allowing the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas]] to remain as custodians in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drtl.org/Research/Alamo4.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

Clara continued to work on behalf of the Alamo&lt;ref name="A Line in the Sand: The Alamo in Blood and Memory"/&gt;  for the rest of her life.  In 1931, she again put up $70,000 of her own money to help the state legislature purchase more city property surrounding the shrine. In 1933, she backed down city engineers who wanted to purchase a portion of the Alamo property to widen Houston Street. By 1935, the persuasive Driscoll talked the [[San Antonio Fire Department|City of San Antonio Fire Department]] out of putting a new fire station adjacent to the Alamo. As president of the DRT in 1936, she oversaw Centennial celebrations of the shrine.

When Clara died in 1945, her body lay in state in the Alamo chapel.

===Political involvement===

Driscoll served as the Democratic party's national committeewoman from Texas 1922–1938 and supported her friend John Nance Garner's&lt;ref name="Garner Loses in Texas Clash"&gt;{{cite news|title=Garner Loses in Texas Clash|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QcUoAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2WkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4008,2412657&amp;dq=clara+driscoll+texas&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=15 July 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hat in the Ring"&gt;{{cite news|last=Heale|first=Raymond Z|title=Hat in the Ring|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=q_sMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fWkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6366,5993021&amp;dq=clara+driscoll+texas&amp;hl=en|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=5 June 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;  1940 bid for the Presidency. Garner's&lt;ref name="Merry-Go-Round"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pearson|first=Drew| last2=Allen| first2=Robert S |title=Merry-Go-Round|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=drsKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Rk0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7162,6035298&amp;dq=clara+driscoll+texas&amp;hl=en|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=22 May 1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; campaign cost $165,000. After Franklin D. Roosevelt was reelected, she remained loyal to FDR.

Upon her death, [[Time (magazine)|Time magazine]]&lt;ref name="Empress Clara"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Empress Clara|magazine=Time Magazine|date=30 July 1945|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801623,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Clara's political acumen:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Money Player. Politicians soon learned to respect her: she could drink, battle, cuss and connive with the best of them, outspend practically all of them. Uvalde's white-browed John Nance Garner became her great &amp; good friend—in &amp; out of smoke-filled rooms, they understood each other. She made quadrennial $25,000 donations to national campaigns, but know-how, not money, worked her up to national committeewoman.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Civic and philanthropic endeavors===

Driscoll served as vice chairman of the Texas Centennial Exposition&lt;ref name="Texas Centennial Commission"&gt;{{cite web|title=Texas Centennial|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lkt01|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; executive board.

In 1939, Clara donated $92,000&lt;ref name="Marker, Clara Driscoll"&gt;{{cite web|title=Marker, Clara Driscoll |url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=25853&amp;Result=1|publisher=HIstorical Marker Database|accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Texas Federation of Women's Clubs Headquarters|Texas Federation of Women's Clubs]], which paid off all debts against their headquarters known as The Mansion.&lt;ref name="The Mansion"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mansion |url=http://themansion.info/about.php|publisher=Texas Federation of Women's Clubs |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, committee workers declared October 4, 1939 as Clara Driscoll Day&lt;ref =name"Committee Women for Clara Driscoll Day are Announced"&gt;{{cite news|title=Committee Women for Clara Driscoll Day are Announced|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HlIdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kVoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5440,2978521&amp;dq=clara+driscoll+texas&amp;hl=en|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=24 September 1939}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]. There was a reception, candle lighting, and unveiling of a portrait titled "Clara Driscoll, Patriot" by Corpus Christi artist Roy Miller.

Clara built the Hotel Robert Driscoll, which opened on May 25, 1942 in Corpus Christi,&lt;ref name="City's historic hotels date back to the 1840s"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Givens|first=Murphy|title=City's historic hotels date back to the 1840s|journal=Caller.com|date=26 August 2009|publisher=Corpus Christi Caller Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; to memorialize her brother. Clara maintained a penthouse suite in the hotel.  The structure is now the [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Building]].

In 1943, Clara deeded Laguna Gloria and a $5,000 gift to Texas Fine Arts Association Holding Company.&lt;ref name="The Texas Fine Arts Association"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shukalo|first=Alice M.|title=Texas Fine Arts Association|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kit01|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|accessdate=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At her death, she established the Driscoll Foundation Children's Hospital in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]].

Many '''closings and cancellations followed the [[September 11 attacks]]''', including major landmarks, buildings, restrictions on access to [[Lower Manhattan]], and postponement or cancellation of major sporting and other events.  Landmarks were closed primarily because of fears that they may be attacked. At some places, streets leading up to the institutions were also closed. When they reopened, there was heightened security. Many states declared a [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/11/attack.closings/index.html|title=CNN.com - Attacks prompt widespread closings - September 12, 2001|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=July 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Lower Manhattan direct effects}}Lower Manhattan==

Speaking at a press conference at 11:02am on the morning of the attacks, Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani|Giuliani]] told New Yorkers: "If you are south of Canal Street, get out. Walk slowly and carefully. If you can’t figure what else to do, just walk north."&lt;ref name="USDOT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/jpodocs/repts_te/14129.htm|title=EFFECTS OF CATASTROPHIC EVENTS ON TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS: NEW YORK CITY- SEPTEMBER 11|author=U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, Volpe National Transportation Systems Center|date=April 2002|accessdate=November 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The neighborhood was covered in dust and debris, and electrical failures caused traffic light outages. Emergency vehicles were given priority to respond to ongoing fires, building collapses, and expected mass casualties.  Over a million workers and residents south of Canal Street evacuated, and police stopped pedestrians from entering lower Manhattan.  With subways shut down, vehicle traffic restricted, and tunnels closed, they mainly fled on foot, pouring over bridges and ferries to Brooklyn and New Jersey.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;

On September 12, vehicle traffic was banned south of 14th Street, subway stations south of Canal Street were bypassed, and pedestrians were not permitted below Chambers Street.  Vehicle traffic below Canal Street was not allowed until October 13.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;

The [[New York Stock Exchange]] did not open on September 11 even as [[CNBC]] showed futures numbers early in the day. As [[Wall Street]] was covered in debris from the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] and suffered infrastructure damage, it remained closed until September 17.

==={{anchor|Manhattan bridges, and tunnels}}Bridges and tunnels===

For at least a full day after the attacks, [[MTA Bridges &amp; Tunnels|bridges and tunnels]] to Manhattan were closed to non-emergency traffic in both directions. Among other things, this interrupted scheduled deliveries of food and other perishables, leading to shortages in restaurants.  From September 27, 2001, one-occupant cars were banned from crossing into Lower Manhattan from Midtown on weekday mornings in an effort to relieve some of the crush of traffic in the city (the morning rush hour lasts from 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 12:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.), caused largely by the increased security measures and closure of major vehicle and transit crossings.

===Mass transit===

===={{anchor|NYC Subway}}New York City Subway====
[[File:Cortlandt St station demolished.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] IRT station, which was directly below the World Trade Center, after the September 11 attacks]]

The tracks and station under the WTC were shut down within minutes of the first plane crash. All remaining [[New York City Subway]] service was suspended from 10:20am to 12:48pm.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;  Immediately after the attacks and more so after the collapses of the Twin Towers, many trains running in Lower Manhattan lost power and had to be evacuated through the tunnels. Some trains had power but the signals did not, requiring special operating procedures to ensure safety.

The [[IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line]], which ran below the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] between [[Chambers Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] and [[Rector Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Rector Street]], was the most crippled.  This section of the tunnel, including [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station (located directly underneath the World Trade Center), was badly damaged, and had to be rebuilt.  Service was immediately suspended south of Chambers Street and then cut back to [[14th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|14th Street]].  There was also subsequent flooding on the line south of [[34th Street–Penn Station (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|34th Street–Penn Station]]. After the flood was cleaned up, express service was able to resume on September 17 with {{NYCS|1}} trains running between [[Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Van Cortlandt Park–242nd Street]] and 14th Street, making local stops north of and express stops south of [[96th Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street]], while {{NYCS|2}} and {{NYCS|3}} trains made all stops in Manhattan (but bypassed all stations between [[Canal Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Canal Street]] and [[Fulton Street (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|Fulton Street]] until October 1). '''1/9''' [[Skip-stop#Rail operation|skip-stop service]] was suspended.

After a few switching delays at 96th Street, service was changed on September 19. The {{NYCS service|1}} train resumed local service in Manhattan, but was extended to [[New Lots Avenue (IRT New Lots Line)|New Lots Avenue]] in Brooklyn (switching onto the express tracks at Chambers Street) to replace the '''3''', which now terminated at 14th Street as an express. The {{NYCS service|2}} train continued to make local stops in Manhattan and service between Chambers Street and [[South Ferry loops (IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line)|South Ferry]] as well as skip-stop service remained suspended. Normal service on all four trains was restored September 15, 2002, but Cortlandt Street remained closed until September 8, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Randy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/17/nyregion/tunnel-vision-with-station-s-reopening-even-commuters-smile.html "Tunnel Vision; With Station's Reopening, Even Commuters Smile"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 17, 2002. Accessed October 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Service on the [[BMT Broadway Line]] was also disrupted because the tracks from the [[Montague Street Tunnel]] run adjacent to the World Trade Center and there were concerns that train movements could cause unsafe settling of the debris pile. [[Cortlandt Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station, which sits under [[Church Street (Manhattan)|Church Street]], sustained significant damage in the collapse of the towers. It was closed until September 15, 2002 for removal of debris, structural repairs, and restoration of the track beds, which had suffered flood damage in the aftermath of the collapse. Starting September 17, 2001, {{NYCS|N}} and {{NYCS|R}} service was suspended and respectively replaced by the {{NYCS service|M}} (which was extended to [[Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue (BMT Sea Beach Line)|Coney Island–Stillwell Avenue]] via the [[BMT Montague Street Tunnel]], [[BMT Fourth Avenue Line]], and [[BMT Sea Beach Line]]) and the {{NYCS service|J}} (also extended via Fourth Avenue to [[Bay Ridge–95th Street (BMT Fourth Avenue Line)|Bay Ridge–95th Street]]). In Queens, the {{NYCS service|Q}} replaced the {{NYCS service|R}} while the {{NYCS service|W}} replaced the {{NYCS|N}}. All service on the BMT Broadway Line ran local north of [[Canal Street (BMT Broadway Line)|Canal Street]] except for the '''&amp;lt;Q&amp;gt;''', which ran normally from [[57th Street–Seventh Avenue (BMT Broadway Line)|57th Street]] to [[Brighton Beach (BMT Brighton Line)|Brighton Beach]] via Broadway and Brighton Express. '''J/Z''' skip-stop service was suspended at this time. Normal service on all seven trains resumed on October 28.

The only subway line running between Midtown and Lower Manhattan was the [[IRT Lexington Avenue Line]], which was overcrowded before the attacks and at crush density until the BMT Broadway Line reopened. [[Wall Street (IRT Lexington Avenue Line)|Wall Street]] was closed until September 21.

The [[IND Eighth Avenue Line]], which has a stub terminal serving the {{NYCS|E}} train under [[Five World Trade Center]], was undamaged, but covered in soot. '''E''' trains were extended to [[Euclid Avenue (IND Fulton Street Line)|Euclid Avenue]], Brooklyn, replacing the then suspended {{NYCS|C}} train (the {{NYCS|A}} and {{NYCS|D}} trains replaced it as the local north of [[59th Street–Columbus Circle (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|59th Street–Columbus Circle]] on nights and weekends, respectively. The {{NYCS|B}} train, which ran normally from [[145th Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|145th Street]] or [[Bedford Park Boulevard (IND Concourse Line)|Bedford Park Boulevard]] to [[34th Street–Herald Square (New York City Subway)|34th Street–Herald Square]] via Central Park West Local, also replaced '''C''' trains on weekdays). Service was cut back to [[Canal Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Canal Street]] when '''C''' service resumed on September 21, but [[Chambers Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Chambers Street]] and [[Fulton Street (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Broadway–Nassau Street]] remained closed until October 1. [[World Trade Center (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|World Trade Center]] remained closed until January 2002.

There were no reported casualties on the subway or loss of train cars, but an [[Motor Coach Industries|MCI]] coach bus was destroyed. Another bus was damaged, but repaired and is back in normal service with a special commemoration livery.

====PATH====
PATH started evacuating passengers from its Manhattan trains and tracks within minutes of the first plane crash.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt; The [[World Trade Center (PATH station)|PATH station at World Trade Center]] was heavily damaged (a train parked in the station was crushed by debris and was removed during the excavation process in January 2002) and all service there was suspended. For several hours, PATH did not run any trains to Manhattan, but was able to restore service on the [[Uptown Hudson Tubes]] to [[33rd Street station (PATH)|33rd Street]] by the afternoon.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;  [[Exchange Place (PATH station)|Exchange Place]] was unusable since the switch configuration at the time required all trains to continue to World Trade Center. As a result, PATH ran a modified service: Hoboken-Journal Square, Hoboken-33rd Street, and Newark-33rd Street. Exchange Place reopened with modifications on June 29, 2003; a temporary station replacing World Trade Center opened on November 23.

====Ferries====
[[Liberty Water Taxi]] and [[NY Waterway]] had a ferry terminal at the [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|World Financial Center]]. As the area around the terminal was in the restricted zone, NY Waterway suspended service to the terminal with alternate service going to [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown]] and [[Wall Street]] and Liberty Water Taxi service was suspended.  Free ad-hoc ferry service to New Jersey, Brooklyn, and Queens began by evening, with about half a million evacuees transported by Circle Line Tours, NY Waterway, privately owned dining boats, tug boats, and at least one fire boat.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;

===={{anchor|Local Bus}}Buses====
MTA buses were temporarily suspended south of Canal Street, and MTA and NJ Transit buses were re-routed to serve passengers arriving in Brooklyn and New Jersey by walking and taking ferries out of Manhattan.

====Intercity transit====
The [[Port Authority Bus Terminal]] was closed until September 13. [[Amtrak]] suspended all of its rail service nationwide until 6pm. [[Greyhound Bus Lines]] cancelled its bus service in the Northeast, but was running normally by  September 13.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;

==North American airspace==

The entire airspaces of the United States and Canada&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysing.org/timeline.html|title=September 11, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were closed ("[[ground stop]]") by order of FAA National Operations Manager [[Ben Sliney]] (who was working his first day at that position)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/interviews/article.html?in_article_id=20603&amp;in_page_id=11 | date = 2006-10-04 | title = 60 Seconds: Ben Sliney | first = Andrew | last = Williams | work = [[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro online]] | publisher = [[Associated Northcliffe Digital]] | location = London | accessdate = 2010-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; except for military, police, and medical flights.  (The unprecedented implementation of [[Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation Aids]] (SCATANA) was the first unplanned closure in the U.S.; military exercises known as [[Operation Skyshield]] had temporarily closed the airspace in the early 1960s.)  Domestic planes were diverted to the nearest available airport.  All non-military flights needed specific approval from [[United States Air Force]] and [[FAA]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} There were only a few dozen private aircraft which received the approval in that time period. [[Civil Air Patrol]]'s aerial photography unit was the earliest non military flight granted approval. [[United Airlines]] cancelled all flights worldwide temporarily.  Grounded passengers and planes were searched for security threats.  [[Amtrak]] was closed until 6pm on September 11, but by September 13 it had increased capacity 30% to deal with an influx of stranded plane passengers.&lt;ref name="USDOT" /&gt;

Many incoming international flights were diverted to [[Atlantic Canada]] to avoid proximity to potential targets in the U.S. and large cities in Canada. Some of the international flights that departed from South America were diverted to [[Mexico]] as well, however, its airspace was not shut down.  On Thursday night, the New York area airports ([[JFK Airport|JFK]], [[LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia]], and [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark]]) were closed again and reopened the next morning. The only traffic from LaGuardia during the closure was a single C-9C government VIP jet, departing at approximately 5:15&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the 12th.

Civilian air traffic was allowed to resume on September 13, 2001, with stricter airport security checks, disallowing for example the box cutting knives that were used by the hijackers.  (Reinforcement of cockpit doors began in October 2001, and was required for larger airlines by 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5470|title=Press Release – FAA Sets New Standards for Cockpit Doors|publisher=|accessdate=September 30, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006083905/http://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=5470|archivedate=October 6, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;)  First, the stranded planes were allowed to go to their intended destinations, then limited service resumed. The backlog of delayed passengers took several days to clear.

Due to a translation error controllers believed [[Korean Air Flight 85]] might have been hijacked. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]] and U.S. authorities ordered the United States Air Force to surround the plane and force it to land in [[Whitehorse, Yukon]] and to shoot down the plane if the pilots did not cooperate. Alaska Governor [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]] ordered the evacuation of large hotels and government buildings in Anchorage. At nearby [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], (also in Alaska), the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] ordered all tankers filling up with oil to head out to sea.

==Government and cultural cancellations and postponements==
{{see also|List of entertainment affected by the September 11 attacks}}

In an atmosphere reminiscent of the [[assassination of John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, everyday life around the world came to a standstill in the days after the September 11 attacks. There was a widespread perception immediately following the attacks that recreational events and sports were not appropriate out of respect for the dead and wounded. For this reason, as well as for reasons of perceived threat associated with large gatherings, many events were postponed or cancelled.  Other events were also cancelled, postponed, or modified:
*Voting on September 11 in the City of New York Mayoral Primary Election was halted. Elections in [[Syracuse, New York]] and [[Buffalo, New York]] were also delayed.
*The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM), with the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] to be held in [[Brisbane]], the state capital of [[Queensland]], [[Australia]], was postponed.  The organizers of the meeting claimed it was not so much a fear of terrorist attack on the meeting itself, but a desire by many Commonwealth leaders to stay at home in case of any further crisis-making world events (such as the commencement of overt military action in Afghanistan or elsewhere).  The [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2002|CHOGM was eventually convened]] at [[Coolum Beach, Queensland]].
*The Mexican Independence Parade scheduled for September 16 in [[Mexico City]] was delayed one day in a show of compassion; many other Independence celebrations were held on the 16th without fireworks.
*Clothing retailer [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] canceled its Christmas 2001 issue of ''[[A&amp;F Quarterly]]'' because the company felt the tone of the publication was not suitable for the mood at that time.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Elliott, [https://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/17/business/media-business-advertising-bowing-nation-s-mood-retailer-cancels-issue-racy.html?pagewanted=all Bowing to Nation's Mood, Retailer Cancels Issue of Racy Catalog], ''New York Times'', October 17, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scribes Codex Vigilanus.jpg|thumb|The scribes: Serracino, Vigila, and García as drawn by Vigila.]]
[[File:View of Toledo, AD 976.jpg|thumb|People from Toledo.]]
[[File:Codex Vigilanus Primeros Numeros Arabigos.jpg|thumb|right|The first Arabic numerals in the West.]]

The '''''Codex Vigilanus''''' or '''''Codex Albeldensis''''' (Spanish: ''Códice Vigilano'' or ''Albeldense'')&lt;!--, full name ''Codex Conciliorum Albeldensis seu Vigilanus'',--&gt; is an [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] compilation of various historical documents accounting for a period extending from antiquity to the 10th century in [[Hispania]]. Among the many texts brought together by the compilers are the canons of the [[Councils of Toledo]], the ''[[Liber Iudiciorum]]'', the decrees of some early [[popes]] and other [[patristic]] writings, historical narratives (such as the '''''Crónica Albeldense'''''&lt;ref&gt;Also ''Chronicon Albeldense'' or ''Epitome Ovetense''.&lt;/ref&gt; and a life of [[Mohammed]]), various other pieces of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[canon law]], and a calendar.

The compilers were three monks of the [[La Rioja (Spain)|Riojan]] monastery of [[San Martín de Albelda]]: Vigila, after whom it was named and who was the illustrator; Serracino, his friend; and García, his disciple. The first compilation was finished in 881, but was updated up to 976. The original manuscript is preserved in the library of [[El Escorial]] (as Escorialensis d I 2). At the time of its compilation, Albelda was the cultural and intellectual centre of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]]. The manuscripts celebrate with illustrations not only the ancient Gothic kings who had reformed the law &amp;mdash; [[Chindasuinth]], [[Reccesuinth]], and [[Ergica]] &amp;mdash; but also its contemporary dedicatees, the [[rulers of Navarre]]: [[Sancho II of Pamplona]] and his queen, [[Urraca Fernández|Urraca]], and his brother [[Ramiro Garcés of Viguera|Ramiro Garcés]], [[King of Viguera]].

The ''Codex'' contains, among other pieces of useful information, the first mention and representation of [[Arabic numerals]] (save [[zero]]) in the [[Western Europe|West]]. They were introduced by the [[Arabs]] into Spain around 900.

The illuminations are stylistically unique, combining [[Visigothic art|Visigothic]], [[Mozarabic]], and [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] elements. The interlace patterns and the drapery show Carolingian, as well [[Byzantine art|Italo-Byzantine]], influence.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmain, "Interlace," 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of animals as decoration and for supporting columns also parallels contemporary Frankish usage.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmain, "Zoomorphic," 24.&lt;/ref&gt; More Carolingian and less Byzantine influence is evident in the ''[[Codex Aemilianensis]]'', a copy of the ''Vigilanus'' made at [[San Millán de la Cogolla]] in 992 by a different illustrator.&lt;ref&gt;Guilmain, "Forgotten," 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Graves''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]], and enemy of the [[Justice League]]. He was created by [[Geoff Johns]] and [[Jim Lee]], and first appeared in ''[[Justice League]]'' #6 (April 2012).

==Creation==
David Graves was created by Justice League writer Geoff Johns and artist Jim Lee. Johns described Graves as a character who would take the classical monomyth or "hero's journey" narrative device, and turn it on its head, illustrating how a villain would go through a twisted version of it, becoming a major threat for the Justice League.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=38059/ | title = Johns Prepares "Justice League" for Graves| work = [[Comic Book Resources]] | date = 2012-06-10 | accessdate =2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
David Graves was a historian and published author, interested in fringe history. He wrote a series of books, on subjects such as Atlantis, the miracles of Fatima, the Nazca Lines, and how they could affect the modern world. During the very first adventure of the Justice League, David, his wife Jennifer, and his two children, Jason and Emma, came under attack by Darkseid's forces. Accepting what he believed to be his fate, and covering his children's eyes for their inevitable death, Graves and his family are saved by the superheroes that would eventually become the Justice League. Believing that the superheroes were a modern incarnation of the gods of antiquity, he set out to research a book about the heroes. It became his most popular title, "Justice League: Gods Among Men".&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League #6 (April 2012)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/121/1219724p1.html | title = Justice League #6 Review | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2012-02-29 | accessdate =2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, within a year of the formation of the Justice League, Graves had developed an unspecified malady which left him trapped in a wheelchair and unlikely to last another year. Faced with the knowledge that his family was gone and the heroes were not going to save him, he snapped, shot his doctor, and vanished. Four years later, David Graves returns completely unrecognizable from his former self, with the faces of his children on his inner forearm. Vowing to destroy the Justice League for their hubris, he then breaks into The Black Room, which is A.R.G.U.S.' secret storage facility where they keep the world's most powerful mystical items, stealing the [[Orb of Ra]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League #9 (July 2012)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/05/17/justice-league-9-review | title = Justice League #9 Review | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2012-05-16 | accessdate =2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he writes in his journal the best way to destroy the Justice League would be through their public liaison [[Steve Trevor]], whom he mails a copy of his book.&lt;ref&gt;''The New 52 #1''&lt;/ref&gt; Graves interrogates [[The Key (comics)|Key]], [[Weapons Master]], [[Scarecrow  (DC Comics)|The Scarecrow]], [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], [[Captain Cold]] and [[Scavenger (comics)|The Scavenger]] in order to discover the league heroes weakness. He then kidnapped Steve Trevor and tortured him. Graves got Trevor to break by threatening to kill his family.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League #10 (August 2012)''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/28/justice-league-10-review | title = Justice League #10 Review | work = [[IGN]] | date = 2012-06-27 | accessdate =2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Little is explained about his powers at the time. He uses spirits to feed off of people's misery, and he has shown to be able to take on the Justice League by using their inner fears against them.

He specializes in history and contemporary politics of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.historyandclassics.ualberta.ca/en/People/Faculty/MarplesDavid.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Marples received his BA Honours from the University of London in 1975, his MA in History from the [[University of Alberta]] in 1980, and Ph.D. in Economic and Social History from the [[University of Sheffield]] in 1985. The title of his Ph.D. dissertation was "Collectivization of agriculture in Western Ukraine 1944-1951."&lt;ref name=phd&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Sheffield|title=Colectivization of agriculture in Western Ukraine 1944-1951.|first= David Roger|last=Marples|date=1985|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.385736|website=ethos.bl.uk|oclc=|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.385736}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Marples began his tenure at University of Alberta in 1991. Earlier, he was a Research Analyst for the Ukrainian Service of [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|Radio Liberty]] in Munich, Germany.

Marples is a former President of The North American Association for Belarusian Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belarusianstudies.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (2010–15) and was formerly Director of the Stasiuk Program on Contemporary Ukraine at the [[Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies]] (2004–14), University of Alberta.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ualberta.ca/CIUS/stasiuk/.index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 he was a Visiting Professor at the Slavic and Eurasian Research Center, Hokkaido University, Japan. At the University of Alberta he is a recipient of the J. Gordin Kaplan Award for Excellence in Research (2003) and the University Cup (2008), the university's highest award.

He is regarded as one of the leading Western authorities on the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe]] (social and political aspects),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JevTU_kmfwg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lukashenko]]'s regime in Belarus, and contemporary Ukraine. In 2014 he published '''''Our Glorious Past': Lukashenka's Belarus and the Great Patriotic War'''', ''the product of an Insight Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. His most recent book is'' ''''Ukraine in Conflict'''' ''published by E-International Relations Publishing in May 2017. 
''
As a historian Marples has written extensively on Eastern European history of the 20th Century including such major historical events as the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution 1917-1920]], [[Holodomor|Ukrainian Famine 1932-1933]], [[Stalinism]], and [[fall of the Soviet Union]].

Marples also contributed to ongoing debates surrounding [[Ukrainian nationalism]] and nationalistic myth-making. In the February 7, 2010 issue of ''[[Edmonton Journal|The Edmonton Journal]]'' he authored an opinion piece  "Hero of Ukraine linked to Jewish killings; Honorary title sure to provoke divisions among Ukrainians today." The piece sparked a new wave of debate surrounding Bandera's figure and his role in Ukrainian history. Eventually, the most important texts of the debate were republished in Ukraine in the collection "Strasti za Banderoiu" (Passions of Bandera, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.grani-t.com.ua/books/2223&lt;/ref&gt;

Marples has written frequently on current political matters of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine for ''Edmonton Journal'', ''Kyiv Post'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kyivpost.com/content/author/david-marples/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Moscow Times'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themoscowtimes.com/sitemap/authors/david-marples/170387.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eurasia Daily Monitor'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jamestown.org/programs/edm/&lt;/ref&gt; ''Open Democracy''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.opendemocracy.net/author/david-marples&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

'''Death messengers''', in former times, were those who were dispatched to spread the news that an inhabitant of their [[city]] or [[village]] had died.  They were to wear unadorned black and go door to door with the message, "You are asked to attend the [[funeral]] of the departed __________ at (time, date, and place)."  This was all they were allowed to say, and were to move on to the next house immediately after uttering the [[wikt:announcement|announcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Swenna Harger &amp; Loren Lemmen, ''The County of Bentheim and her Emigrants to North America'', 4th edition (Holland, MI: Swenna Harger, 1994), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  This [[tradition]] persisted in some areas to as late as the mid-19th century.

The '''Divadlo v Kotcích''', German '''Theater an der Kotzen''', in English more usually '''Kotzen Theatre''', was a [[Prague]] theatre and opera venue on v Kotcích street, which had its heyday 1739-1783 as the second public opera theatre in Prague.&lt;ref&gt;Contrary to a widespread misconception, the opera theatre of Count Franz Anton von Sporck was not a private theatre, but a public theatre, as documented in [[Daniel E. Freeman]] - ''The opera theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' - 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Spoken plays and ballets were also presented there.  

For many seasons it was run by the Italian impresario [[Santo Lapis]], then [[Giovanni Battista Locatelli]], who staged [[Ezio (Gluck)|Gluck's Prague Ezio, 1750]], and other works.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceskyhudebnislovnik.cz/slovnik/index.php?option=com_mdictionary&amp;action=record_detail&amp;id=572 History of performances in Czech]&lt;/ref&gt; Later impresarios who worked there include [[Gaetano Molinari]] and [[Giuseppe Bustelli]]. The more correct "Theater an der Kotzen" was often colloquially referred to as the "Kotzentheater," Kotzen being a Slavonic-German term for a market.&lt;ref&gt;''The opera theater of Count Franz Anton von Sporck in Prague'' - Page 72 Daniel E. Freeman - 1992 "Already by 1737 there were firm plans to construct a new permanent theater in the Old City of Prague in the "Kotzen," which at that time meant a market or bazaar.85"&lt;/ref&gt; It closed in 1783 for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Opera v Praze'' Alexandr Buchner - 1985  "It was reconstructed from the old market hall. Its first director was Santo Lapis, impresario of the Italian operatic society. The V Kotcích Theatre was discontinued in 1783 for safety reasons."&lt;/ref&gt;

It was preceded by the opera theatre of Count [[Franz Anton von Sporck]], which operated between 1724 and 1735, and succeeded by Count Nostitz's "National Theatre," now the [[Estates Theatre]] (or "Stavovské divadlo"), which opened on 21 April 1783. The current [[National Theatre (Prague)|National Theatre, "Národní divadlo"]] did not open until 1881.

'''Docomomo International''' (sometimes written as '''DoCoMoMo''' or simply '''Docomomo''') is a non-profit organization whose full title is '''International Committee for Documentation and Conservation of Buildings, Sites and Neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement'''.

Mrinalini Rajagopalan, author of "Preservation and Modernity: Competing Perspectives, Contested Histories and the Question of Authenticity," described it as "the key body for the preservation of modernist architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n354cBry_6EC&amp;pg=PA324|title=The SAGE Handbook of Architectural Theory|date=2012|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=9781446282632|edition=paperback|location=|page=324|chapter=Preservation and Modernity: Competing Perspectives, Contested Histories and the Question of Authenticity|quote=|via=|last1=Rajagopalan|first1=Mrinalini|editor1-last=Crysler|editor1-first=C. Greig|editor2-last=Cairns|editor2-first=Stephen|editor3-last=Heynen|editor3-first=Hilde|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Its foundation was inspired by the work of ICOMOS, the [[International Council on Monuments and Sites]], established in 1965. The work of Icomos was concerned with the protection and conservation of historical buildings and sites, whereas Docomomo was founded to take up the challenge of the protection and conservation of [[Modern Architecture]] and [[Urbanism]].

Docomomo International was founded in [[Eindhoven]] in 1988 by [[Dutch people|Dutch]] architects [[Hubert-Jan Henket]] and Wessel de Jonge. Henket chaired Docomomo International with de Jonge as secretary until September 2000 when the International Secretariat relocated to Paris, where it was hosted by the [[Cité de l’Architecture et du Patrimoine]], in the [[Palais de Chaillot]]. The chair was Maristella Casciato, architect and architectural historian; with Émilie d'Orgeix, architectural historian, as secretary and Anne-Laure Guillet as director.

In 2008 there were 2,000 individual members. That year, 49 countries had national chapters and working parties of Docomomo. In 2010, the International Secretariat was relocated to Barcelona, hosted by the Fundació Mies van der Rohe. Ana Tostoes, architect and architect historian, chairs Docomomo International with Ivan Blasi, architect, as secretary. In 2014 the secretariat was transferred to the Instituto Superior Técnico at Lisbon, Portugal. Professor Tostoes remained as chair, with Zara Ferreira as secretary.

==Conferences and seminars==
Docomomo holds biennial international conferences where the people related to conservation issues gather and exchange information and studies pertaining to their scholarly research. The list of conferences held until now is as follows:

*1990 - Eindhoven, The Netherlands
*1992 - Bauhaus Dessau, Germany
*1994 - Barcelona, Spain
*1996 - Bratislava and Sliac, Slovakia
*1998 - Stockholm, Sweden
*2000 - Brasília, Brazil
*2002 - Paris, France
*2004 - New York, United States
*2006 - Istanbul and Ankara, Turkey
*2008 - Rotterdam, The Netherlands
*2010 - Mexico City, Mexico
*2012 - Espoo, Finland
*2014 - Seoul, South Korea
*2016 - Lisbon, Portugal

The International Scientific Committee on Technology (ISC/T) organizes seminars covering the following themes: restoration of reinforced concrete structures, curtain-wall facades, windows and glass, wood and the modern movement, colours in modern architecture and stone in modern buildings.

Seminars and conferences are often held in key modernist buildings, as for instance at [[Alvar Aalto]]’s [[Vyborg Library]] (2003 ISC/T seminar), Brinkman and [[Leendert van der Vlugt]]'s Van Nelle factory in [[Rotterdam]] (2008 Conference), and Gordon Bunshaft's [[Lever House]] in New York (closing party at 2004 Conference).

==Publications==
The ''Docomomo Journal'' is published twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, James P. and Evans Yankopolus, Jennifer, "Docomomo." ''Almanac of Architecture &amp; Design 2006''. Greenway Communications, November 1, 2005. {{ISBN|0975565427}}, 9780975565421. p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jh7ecV24_uAC&amp;pg=PA426 426].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work at national level==
Many countries have national Docomomo working parties, as either part of academic establishments or architecture federations. They may define gazetteers of important structures to be protected, such as [[DoCoMoMo Key Scottish Monuments]] and DoCoMoMo Architectural Masterpieces of Finnish Modernism,&lt;ref&gt;''DoCoMoMo Architectural Masterpieces of Finnish Modernism'', Maija Kairamo et al. (eds.), Helsinki: docomomo Suomi-Finland, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; or support local campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2009/07/18/why-we-have-to-protect-our-modern-buildings-91466-24172488/ Why we have to protect our modern buildings], ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'', 18 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Preservation work by Docomomo together with others was recognised by the [[New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection]] after a 2009 [[charrette]] to protect the former [[Bell Labs Holmdel Complex]].&lt;ref&gt;"Bell Labs charrette recognized by state", ''Greater Media Newspapers'', June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He relocated to [[London]] in 1978 to work on a doctorate (completed in 1982) on the origins of the Semitic component in the Yiddish language at the [[University of London]], where he won the John Marshall Medal in Comparative Philology (1980).&lt;ref&gt;The thesis is online at: https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1982.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early linguistic work, he began to argue for "continual transmission" of the Semitic component in Yiddish from Hebrew through to [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] through to Yiddish, challenging the standard "text theory" that postulated entrance principally via religious texts later on.&lt;ref&gt;(1979) "A yerushe fun kadmoynim: der semitisher kheylek in yidish" ''in'' {{cite book|last=Katz|first=David|title=Oksforder Yiddish: A Yearbook of Yiddish Studies II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gL-K0xAbwk4C|year=1991|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-3-7186-5206-8|pages=17–95}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed novel reconstructions for parts of the [[Yiddish dialects#Comparison|proto-Yiddish vowel system]],&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Katz, "First steps in the reconstruction of the proto vocalism of the Semitic component in Yiddish", Dec. 1977, seminar paper available at: https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1977.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; modifications in the classification of [[Yiddish dialects]],&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Katz, "Zur Dialektologie des Jiddischen" in W. Besch et al (eds), "Dialektologie. Ein Handbuch zur deutschen und allgemeinen Dialektforschung", Berlin 1983, pp. 1018-1041.&lt;/ref&gt; and joined the school of Yiddish scholars that argues for a more easterly ([[List of tributaries of the Danube|Danube basin]]) origin of Yiddish over the western ([[Rhineland]]) hypothesis, bringing to the table Semitic component evidence; it was in that connection that he came across a thirteenth-century Hebrew and Aramaic prayerbook manuscript in the Bodleian that exhibited the vowel system he had earlier, in his thesis, reconstructed as underlying that of the Semitic component in Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Katz,"The Proto Dialectology of Ashkenaz" in D. Katz (ed), "Origins of the Yiddish Language", Pergamon 1987, pp. 47-60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years he published papers in Yiddish and English on various "history of ideas" topics, including the role of Aramaic in Aramaic-Hebrew-Yiddish internal [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] trilingualism (he rejected the notion of a single fused Hebrew-hyphen-Aramaic); medieval rabbinic disputes over Yiddish; rabbinic contributions to Yiddish dialectology; the importance of the German underworld language [[Rotwelsch]] for Yiddish linguistics; Christian studies in Yiddish; and the 19th century roots of religious Yiddishism, among others.&lt;ref&gt;Papers on these and related topics are [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_linguistics.htm listed and posted on Katz's website].&lt;/ref&gt;

For eighteen years (1978-1996) he taught Yiddish Studies at Oxford, building from scratch, sometimes single-handedly, the Oxford Programme in Yiddish. It grew in the 1980s and 1990s into an international program. His contributions include initiating a new four-week summer course&lt;ref&gt;https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm#4 Four-week summer course&lt;/ref&gt; at four levels of language instruction (in 1982), the annual Stencl Lecture (from 1983),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm#Stencl Annual Stencl Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katz edited the first six lectures in pamphlet form between 1984 and 1989; see:https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm; also [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm#8 Mementos of the early Stencl Lectures]&lt;/ref&gt; annual winter symposiums (from 1985);&lt;ref&gt;https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm#5 Winter symposiums&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Oxford]] BA, MSt and MPhil options (from 1982), and a doctoral program (from 1984), these being concentrated in the University's Faculty of Medieval and Modern Languages.&lt;ref&gt;Various illustrative documents from the period are posted at: https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; His former doctoral students are today professors of Yiddish at [[Indiana University]] (Bloomington) and [[Düsseldorf]] among others. He founded the series ''Winter Studies in Yiddish'' in English (vol. 1 appeared in 1987),&lt;ref&gt;Four volumes appeared of which Katz edited the first two: {{cite book|last=Katz|first=Dovid|title=Origins of the Yiddish Language: Papers from the First Annual Oxford Winter Symposium in Yiddish Language and Literature, 15-17 December 1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzwOAAAAYAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Pergamon Press|isbn=978-0-08-034156-9}} and {{cite book|last=Katz|first=Dovid|title=Dialects of the Yiddish Language: Winter Studies in Yiddish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSyLBQAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4832-9950-1}}; [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_oxford.htm#6 mementos of the project]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Oksforder Yidish'' (or "Oxford Yiddish"), entirely in Yiddish (vol. 1 appeared in 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Three vols. appeared, edited by Katz: 1 (1990) and 2 (1991) in standard format; vol. 3 (1995) is a large 1000 columned folio. The series was launched [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/Oxford/6/1990%20Aug%2022%20London%20Launch.pdf at the London Press Centre].&lt;/ref&gt; His posts, at the [[Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies|Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies]] (renamed the Oxford Centre for Hebrew and Jewish Studies) were instructor and junior fellow (1978-1982), senior research fellow and director of Yiddish studies (1983-1994). In 1994 he founded the Oxford Institute for Yiddish Studies and served as its research director until 1997.&lt;ref name="AJ Yearbook 1998"&gt;''American Jewish Yearbook'', 1998, Vol. 98. Ed. David Singer. New York: American Jewish Committee, 1998. {{ISBN|0-87495-113-5}} {{ISBN|978-0874951134}}. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; He was Research Fellow at [[St. Antony's College]] Oxford from 1986 to 1997, and a member of the Modern Language Faculty's Graduate Studies Committee from 1984 to 1997.

After an initial trip to his ancestral [[Lithuania]] and [[Belarus]] in 1990 (during which he negotiated an agreement&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/06/arts/lithuania-and-oxford-are-linked-by-yiddish.html Agreement&lt;/ref&gt; enabling Lithuanian students to enroll in Oxford Jewish studies courses), Katz pioneered the mounting of in-situ post-Holocaust Yiddish dialectological and folkloristic expeditions in Eastern Europe. He focused on the "Lithuanian lands" (Belarus, Lithuania, Latvia, etc.) and continues work on his Atlas of Northeastern Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Around thirty maps have appeared to date on the in-progress web version of the Atlas at: https://www.dovidkatz.net/WebAtlas/AtlasSamples.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; He has amassed thousands of hours of recorded interviews with "the last of the Yiddish Mohicans" in these regions but as far as is known has thus far failed to find a permanent home for the materials. In early 2013 he began posting clips from his interviews of Boro Park Yiddish speakers gleaned from his return trips to his native Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;His earliest collection constituted [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPwSEWFyAp59fq6rpvzJuuLJ_nfGHibz4 a Youtube playlist] on his channel.&lt;/ref&gt;

His publications on Yiddish language include his "Grammar of the Yiddish Language" (London, 1987) and his book in Yiddish, "Tikney takones. Fragn fun yidisher stilistik" (Oxford, 1993),&lt;ref&gt;https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFStylistics/1993.pdf "Tikney takones. Fragn fun yidisher stilistik"&lt;/ref&gt; both of which aimed to enhance the teaching of Yiddish as a vibrant language both spoken and for new literary and academic works, even if in (and for) small circles. In both works, he advocated a descriptivist stance, rejecting what he considered to be the excessive purism prevalent in the field, particularly in New York. He also (controversially) championed the traditionalist variant of modern Yiddish orthography, and was the author of the "Code of Yiddish Spelling" (Oxford, 1992).&lt;ref&gt;https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFStylistics/1992.pdf "Code of Yiddish Spelling"&lt;/ref&gt; He twice founded and directed (one-time only) Yiddish teacher training programs: at Oxford, a one-year program in 1996, and at Vilnius, an intensive course in spring 2005.

For a nonspecialist English readership he wrote a history of the language and its culture, "Words on Fire: The Unfinished Story of Yiddish" (Basic Books 2004, revised edition with added academic apparatus, 2007), which attracted both acclaim and robust debate, particularly over his predictions of a vernacular future for Yiddish based in Haredi communities, and his contention that [[modern Hebrew]] could not replace the European-nuanced vibrancy of Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews include [https://forward.com/articles/4422/ladies-and-gentlemen-the-once-and-future-yiddish/ Zachary Sholem Berger] in the Forward (Oct 29, 2004), [https://www.nysun.com/arts/persistence-of-yiddish/4232/ Jeremy Dauber] in the New York Sun (Nov 3, 2004), [https://business.highbeam.com/5729/article-1G1-130581463/saving-language-chutzpah Norman Lebrecht] in the Evening Standard (March 21, 2005),[https://www.dovidkatz.net/Reviews/soy_57_TimesHigher.htm Susanne Marten-Finnis] in the Times Higher Education Supplement (Oct 6, 2006), [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/words-on-fire-by-dovid-katz-broutwitting-history-by-aaron-lansky-6151073.html Julia Pascal] in the Independent (March 4, 2005), [https://www.dovidkatz.net/Reviews/soy_4_JerusalemP.htm Miriam Shaviv] in the Jerusalem Post (2004), [https://www.dovidkatz.net/Reviews/soy_50_LibraryJournal.htm Gene Shaw] in Library Journal (Dec. 2004), [https://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/tlssearch.do?querystring=Joseph+Sherman&amp;sectionId=1797&amp;p=tls Joseph Sherman] in the Times Literary Supplement (May 27, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; For years he wrote regular columns for the Forverts (1990s), and in more recent years for the [[Algemeiner Journal]],&lt;ref&gt;DovidKatz.net has a number of his Algemeiner Zhurnal (Algemeyner zhurnal) posted, on the pages [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_linguistics.htm for Yiddish studies] and [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_lithuania.htm for Lithuanian issues].&lt;/ref&gt; which seemed to have stopped with the departure of Y.Y. Jacobson as editor around 2010. In 2015, his book ''Yiddish and Power'' was published in the UK by Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.palgrave.com/us/book/9780230517608&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of a number of articles on Yiddish in encyclopedias (including [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Language/Yiddish YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;He later posted a slightly [https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/2008_YIDDISH_Yivo_Encyclopedia.pdf Amended version] on his website.&lt;/ref&gt; and book introductions, including the Yivo's reprint&lt;ref&gt;https://yalepress.yale.edu/languages/pdf/Harkavy_preface.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} The Yivo's reprint&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Alexander Harkavy]]'s trilingual Yiddish-English-Hebrew dictionary.

After a year as visiting professor at [[Yale University]] (1998-1999), Katz relocated to [[Vilnius]] in 1999 in order to take up a new chair in Yiddish language, literature and culture at [[Vilnius University]], and to found the university's Center for Stateless Cultures,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/939/ Center for Stateless Cultures&lt;/ref&gt; which he directed for its first two years. He had relocated his old Oxford Yiddish summer program to Vilnius a year earlier (summer 1998). In 2001, he founded the Vilnius Yiddish Institute at Vilnius University and remained its research director and primary instructor until 2010. His works on Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) culture include the folio volume "Lithuanian Jewish Culture" (Baltos lankos, Vilnius 2004, revised edition 2010), "Windows to a Lost Jewish Past: Vilna Book Stamps" (Versus aureus, Vilnius 2008), and "Seven Kingdoms of the Litvaks" (International Cultural Program Center, Vilnius 2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/Lithuania/7_KingdomsLitvaks.pdf "Seven Kingdoms of the Litvaks"&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 he directed the "Jewish Lithuania" program for Summer Literary Seminars in Vilnius. He has proposed "Litvak Studies"&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/litvak-studies "Litvak Studies"&lt;/ref&gt; as a potential program of study.

He began to write short stories in Yiddish following his father's death in 1991, and published three collections in book form in the 1990s under the nom de plume Heershadovid Menkes ([[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]: הירשע־דוד מעינקעס—''Hirshe-Dovid Meynkes''): Eldra Don, 1992; The Flat Peak, 1993; Tales of the Misnagdim from Vilna Province, 1996. After experimenting with modern themes, he abandoned them for the vanished life of old Jewish Lithuania, to some extent violating norms of modern Yiddish to write works set in older Jewish Lithuania in local dialect. Awards for his fiction came from within the secular Yiddish environment: the Hirsh Rosenfeld Award ([[Canadian Jewish Congress]], 1994), the Zhitlovsky Prize (Ikuf, 1996) and the most prestigious Yiddish literary award, the Manger Prize, in 1997. In 1994 he founded at Oxford the then sole literary monthly magazine in Yiddish, "Yiddish Pen"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm#YP "Yiddish Pen"&lt;/ref&gt; and edited its first 27 issues.&lt;ref&gt;See: https://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_periodicals.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It did not, however, usher in the literary revival he had hoped for, and his own works of fiction received little recognition outside the narrow world of secular Yiddish culture. Years, later translated anthologies of his short stories appeared in 2012, in English&lt;ref&gt;City in the Moonlight: Stories of the Old-time Lithuanian Jews. Yiddish stories by Dovid Katz. Selected and translated by Barnett Zumoff. Ktav: New York 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and in German,&lt;ref&gt;Ostjüdische Geschichten aus dem alten Litauen. Yiddish stories by Dovid Katz. Selected and translated by Melitta Depner. Salon: München 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; but received little critical attention. In 2001-2002 he was a [[List of Guggenheim Fellowships awarded in 2000|Guggenheim Fellow]] in [[Yiddish literature]].

Katz, taken aback by the poverty he found among the last aged Yiddish speakers in Eastern Europe (many of them "flight survivors" who survived the war by fleeing to the [[Soviet Union]], hence not eligible for aid under the narrow definition of "Holocaust survivor"), alerted the wider world to the issue in a 1999 op-ed&lt;ref&gt;https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/Lithuania/1999-How%20to%20help%20the%20Holocausts%20Last%20Victims.jpg 1999 op-ed&lt;/ref&gt; in the Forward, which was cited by Judge Edward R. Korman in the [[Banking in Switzerland|Swiss Banks]] settlement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swissbankclaims.com/Documents/Doc_51_HSF.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107170608/https://swissbankclaims.com/Documents/Doc_51_HSF.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-07 |df= }} The Swiss Banks settlement&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. District Court in 2004. Katz began to work closely with the [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]] (JDC) on these issues, and he helped inspire and inform the 2004 founding of the Survivor Mitzvah Project by a group based in [[Santa Monica, California]].

In October 2012, he took part in the Channel 4 reality series "Jewish Mum of the Year" as one of the judging panel alongside [[Tracy-Ann Oberman]] and Richard Ferrer.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Ferrer in the Independent,16 Oct 2012, online at: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/channel-4s-jewish-mum-of-the-year-was-my-idea-and-im-proud-of-it-8209464.html.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the reviews of his own appearance judged it negatively&lt;ref&gt;See the reviews by [https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/last-nights-viewing—jewish-mum-of-the-year-channel-4-fresh-meat-channel-4-8204217.html?origin=internalSearch Tom Sutcliffe in the Independent] and [https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/oct/09/jewish-mum-of-the-year?INTCMP=SRCH John Crace in the Guardian].&lt;/ref&gt; and it seems he did not think much of the program himself.

In 2013  he initiated a "[http://defendinghistory.com/virtual-yiddish-mini-museum-of-old-jewish-vilna-index/91536 Virtual Mini Museum of Old Jewish Vilna]" with item descriptions in Yiddish and index in English.

In June 2014, two articles in Tablet magazine focused on the recent history and status of Yiddish linguistics, including his own contributions (and controversies).&lt;ref&gt;See Cherie Woodworth's [https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/165247/yiddish-ashkenazi-woodworth "Where did Yiddish come from?"] and Batya Ungar-Sargon's [https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/176580/yiddishland "The mystery of the origins of Yiddish will never be solved"]&lt;/ref&gt; Katz promptly responded (in Yiddish).&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Katz, [https://defendinghistory.com/freewheeling-deconstruction-max-weinreich-ongoing-machinations-weakened-field-yiddish "Tsu der zorglozer dekonstruktsye fun Maks Vaynraykhn"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, he embarked on a project to translate the (Hebrew) Bible into Lithuanian Yiddish.&lt;ref&gt;His online contents of the translations to date are at: https://defendinghistory.com/lithuanian-yiddish-bible-translations&lt;/ref&gt; By mid 2016, he had posted drafts of ''[https://defendinghistory.com/the-book-of-daniel-in-lithuanian-yiddish Daniel],'' ''[https://defendinghistory.com/the-book-of-esther-in-lithuanian-yiddish Esther]'', ''[https://defendinghistory.com/74250-2 Kings I],'' ''[https://defendinghistory.com/ii-kings-in-lithuanian-yiddish Kings II]'', ''[https://defendinghistory.com/the-book-of-lamentations-in-lithuanian-yiddish Lamentations],'' and ''[https://defendinghistory.com/the-book-of-ruth-in-lithuanian-yiddish Ruth].By 2018 he [http://defendinghistory.com/lithuanian-yiddish-bible-translations had added several more books] (and completed the Five Megillot), and published [http://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Ruth-first-3-prelims.pdf in booklet form] The Book of Ruth in Lithuanian Yiddish (Vilnius 2017).''

In 2018, to honor the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the modern Lithuanian republic in 1918, he initiated [http://defendinghistory.com/index-to-virtual-mini-museum-of-jewish-life-in-the-interwar-lithuanian-republic/91524 a new online Yiddish "mini-museum"] stressing interwar Yiddish-Lithuanian multicultural and bilingual life.

The same year, he launched online his [http://yiddishculturaldictionary.org Yiddish Cultural Dictionary] which is an English-Yiddish dictionary (still in an early stage) stressing cultural specificities and with all discussions of entries in Yiddish. It is rooted in his earlier descriptivist work in Yiddish stylistics, and is inherently opposed to some of the more normative and purist trends in Yiddish stylistics in the United States.

== Holocaust History and Human Rights Activism ==

After observing the Vilnius scene for years, Dovid Katz began in 2008 to publicly challenge the "[[Holocaust uniqueness debate|double genocide]]" theory of [[World War II]] and the accusations against Holocaust survivors who survived by joining the [[Jewish partisans]]. In a Rothschild Foundation London seminar in February that year he proposed the term "Holocaust Obfuscation" for an East European trend to downgrade the Holocaust into one of two purportedly equal genocides (without actually denying any deaths); he refined the term in a 2009 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Dovid Katz, "On three definitions: Genocide; Holocaust Denial; Holocaust Obfuscation" in L. Donskis, ed., "A Litmus Test Case of Modernity (etc.), Peter Lang 2009, pp. 259-277. Online at: https://www.defendinghistory.com/2009SeptDovidKatz3Definitions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; When, in May 2008, Lithuanian prosecutors launched investigations of two more elderly Holocaust survivors, Fania Yocheles Brantsovsky and Dr. [[Rachel Margolis]], Katz embarked on a new activist phase of his life. He became a staunch advocate for the accused Holocaust survivors who were under investigation, and played a role in mobilizing the Western diplomatic community in Vilnius to support them. Results, achieved in partnership with Vilnius-based diplomats, included a reception by the Irish ambassador for Ms. Brantsovsky, awarding her a certificate,&lt;ref&gt;https://holocaustinthebaltics.com/2June2008IrishEmbassy.JPG A certificate&lt;/ref&gt; on 3 June 2008 (the same day the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]] was signed), and a certificate of merit&lt;ref&gt;https://holocaustinthebaltics.com/30April2008USEmbassyCertificatetoFania.jpg Certificate of merit&lt;/ref&gt; from the American ambassador. This was followed in August that year by a letter from nine NATO-member embassies&lt;ref&gt;https://www.holocaustinthebaltics.com/25August2008fromninewesternemnbassies.pdf A letter from nine NATO-member embassies&lt;/ref&gt; to Dr. [[Rachel Margolis]] in [[Rehovot]], Israel, and, in 2010, by a letter from seven European ambassadors&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/ambassadors-protest-antisemitism-in-lithuania/6362 A letter from seven European ambassadors&lt;/ref&gt; that noted the legalization of swastikas that year, renewed [[Holocaust denial]], and the attempts to "equalize" Nazi and Soviet crimes.

His professorship at [[Vilnius University]] was terminated after eleven years in 2010 after he published several articles critical of Lithuanian prosecutors' campaign against Holocaust survivors who joined the partisans.. He began (and continues) to [http://dovidkatz.net/dovid/dovid_cv.htm lecture quite widely]. In 2016 was appointed professor (on an adjunct basis) at Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU), [http://ki.vgtu.lt/creative-industries/departments/department-of-philosophy-and-cultural-studies/contacts/55890 in the Department of Philosophy and Cultural Studies] (but is not teaching Judaic or Yiddish studies).

In September 2009 Katz launched the openly partisan online journal ''HolocaustInTheBaltics.com'', which was renamed a year later ''DefendingHistory.com'', and came to include contributions by several dozen authors;&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/authors Authors&lt;/ref&gt; it has sections on the regional glorification of local [[collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|Nazi collaborators]],&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/collaborators-glorified Glorification of local Nazi collaborators&lt;/ref&gt; and the related "exotic tourism"&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/exotic-jewish-tourism "Exotic tourism"&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Opinion,&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/opinion Opinion&lt;/ref&gt; Books,&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/books Books&lt;/ref&gt; Film&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/theatre Film&lt;/ref&gt; and History&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/history History&lt;/ref&gt; sections. Over time, DefendingHistory has also become one of the addresses for resources in Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) affairs,&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/jewish-lithuania Resources in Litvak (Lithuanian Jewish) affairs&lt;/ref&gt; including culture, history, news, tourism and "[[dark tourism]]."

In 2012 he co-authored (with [[Danny Ben-Moshe]]) ''[[The Seventy Years Declaration]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://defendinghistory.com/70-years-declaration/29230 Seventy Years Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; signed on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the [[Wannsee Conference]] by 71 European parliamentarians (MPs and MEPs, including Conservatives and Liberals as well as Social Democrats and Labor, also—eight Lithuanian Social Democratic parliamentarians). He was invited to present it formally to [[Martin Schulz]],&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/avservices/services/showShotlist.do?filmRef=82876&amp;out=HTML&amp;lg=en&amp;src=1 Martin Schulz&lt;/ref&gt; president of the [[European Parliament]], in [[Strasbourg]] on March 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Text at: https://defendinghistory.com/70-years-declaration/29230.

On the subject of free speech, he has been a vocal critic of Lithuania's 2010 law&lt;ref&gt;https://holocaustinthebaltics.com/red-brown-bill-with-two-years-of-jailtime-for-disagreeing-with-governments-position-is-signed-into-law/843 A vocal critic of Lithuania's 2010 law&lt;/ref&gt; forbidding the denial or trivialization of Soviet and Nazi genocide, which he believes, in agreement with [[Leonidas Donskis]],&lt;ref&gt;https://www.holocaustinthebaltics.com/2008OctDecDonskisCriminalizationofDebate.PDF Agreement with Leonidas Donskis&lt;/ref&gt; to constitute criminalization of debate. When the law was applied to a left-wing politician with whom he disagreed wholly on the 1991 events in question, Katz nevertheless felt it important to speak out for free speech,&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/on-the-paleckis-trial-in-vilnius/14504 Free speech&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a reply to Rokas Grajauskas in Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/13705/13705 Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review&lt;/ref&gt; made clear his view that objecting to Holocaust Obfuscation in no way signifies reluctance to expose Stalinist crimes.

In recent years, Katz has registered concern regarding purported policy shifts toward Holocaust Obfuscation and Double Genocide by the [[United States Department of State]], in articles in ''Tablet'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Dovid|title=Conference Call: The Lithuanian sponsors of a Holocaust education program have a dark history of their own|url=https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/52058/conference-call|work=Tablet|issue=December 3, 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' (2010)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/dec/21/double-genocide-baltic-us-europe Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Algemeiner Journal]]'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Dovid|title=Hannah Rosenthal Does It Again|url=https://www.algemeiner.com/2011/11/25/hannah-rosenthal-does-it-again/|work=The Algemeiner|date=November 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times of Israel'' (2012)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Dovid|title=Efraim Zuroff, history’s lonely defender|url=https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/efraim-zuroff-historys-lonely-sentinel/|work=The Times of Israel|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a list of publications maintained on ''DefendingHistory.com''.&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/us-state-dept-manipulated List of publications maintained on DefendingHistory.com&lt;/ref&gt; He also spoke out regarding alliances binding the UK's Conservative Party with controversial East European right wing politics, in ''The Irish Times'' (2009),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/1031/1224257766699.html Irish Times&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' (2010), ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Katz|first1=Dovid|title=It is time for Cameron to reject the EU nutters|url=https://www.thejc.com/comment/comment/it-is-time-for-cameron-to-reject-the-eu-nutters-1.15790|work=www.thejc.com|date=May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''London Jewish News'' (2012).&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Dovid-Katz-op-ed-in-London-Jewish-News-13-Dec-2012.pdf Jewish News&lt;/ref&gt; Analogously, he challenged [[Israeli foreign policy]] on alleged acequiscence to Holocaust Obfuscation in return for diplomatic support, in venues including the ''[[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/2010IsraelJournalofForeignAffairsDovidKatz.pdf Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Jerusalem Post]], ''The Times of Israel '' and ''DefendingHistory.com''.&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/category/israel DefendingHistory.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 2011, Katz was Jan Randa Visiting Scholar at the Australian Center for Jewish Civilization (ACJC) at [[Monash University]] in Melbourne where he lectured on both Yiddish Studies and Holocaust issues. He has worked to define the new and "nuanced" elitist East European antisemitism and its success in attracting unsuspecting westerners to help provide political cover. He presented findings at Yale University&lt;ref&gt;https://holocaustinthebaltics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/YALE14Apr2011.pdf.pdf Yale University&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holocaust Revisionism, Ultranationalism, and the Nazi/Soviet "Double Genocide" Debate in Eastern Europe|url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/event/holocaust-revisionism-ultranationalism-and-the-nazisoviet-double-genocide-debate-eastern|website=Wilson Center|date=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011, and at a December 13, 2012 ISGAP event at [[Fordham University]]&lt;ref&gt;https://vimeo.com/55692172 December 13, 2012 ISGAP event at Fordham University&lt;/ref&gt; in [[New York City]]. He participated in the April 18, 2013 seminar on "[[Red equals Brown]] issues"&lt;ref&gt;https://defendinghistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/flyer_rot_gleich_braun.pdf Seminar on "red-brown issues"&lt;/ref&gt; in Berlin, and a May 27–28, 2013 conference in Riga on Holocaust commemoration in post-communist Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.shamir.lv/en/item/190-the_second_international_conference_holocaust_museums_and_memorial_places_in_post-communist_countries_challenges_and_opportunities_.html&lt;/ref&gt; A Spring 2016 lecture tour included lectures on Yiddish, Litvak and Holocaust topics at the University of Toronto and York University in Toronto; UCLA in Los Angeles; ISGAP, Baruch College, and the Mid-Manhattan New York Public Library in New York; Fairfield University and Yale in Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;A list of his spring 2016 lecture tour venues with further links: https://defendinghistory.com/spring-2016-lecture-tour-in-north-america&lt;/ref&gt; In Sept. 2016 he was [http://ki.vgtu.lt/creative-industries/departments/department-of-philosophy-and-cultural-studies/contacts/55890 appointed professor at another university in Vilnius], VGTU, in its Department of Philosophy and Cultural Studies.

Unexpectedly for many in his circles, he became, in 2015, a staunch opponent of plans to locate a national convention center on the grounds of Vilnius's 15th century-origin old Jewish cemetery. His activities included helping inspire an array of international published protest statements,&lt;ref&gt;See: https://defendinghistory.com/who-is-opposed-to-the-convention-center-on-the-old-vilna-jewish-cemetery-at-piramont-in-snipiskes/75558&lt;/ref&gt; maintaining a monitoring section in ''Defending History''.&lt;ref&gt;See: https://defendinghistory.com/category/jewish-cemetery-piramont-snipiskes-shnipishok&lt;/ref&gt; One summary of his views appeared in ''The Times of Israel'' in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;See Dovid Katz, "Lithuania's Liveliest Cemetery" in ''The Times of Israel'', 13 December 2015 (https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/lithuanias-liveliest-cemetery/).&lt;/ref&gt; He has argued that the rights of the dead, especially those in long-ago paid-for burial plots, include the right to be left in peace.

Katz keeps [http://defendinghistory.com/dovid-katz-recent-publications71810-2 an online record of his published writings], and a separate list of papers on Holocaust Studies in [https://defendinghistory.com/holocaust-and-antisemitism-studies-papers-and-reviewsin-academic-venues academic format].

'''George Saxon &amp; Co''' was an English engineering company that manufactured [[stationary steam engine]]s.  It was based in the [[Openshaw]] district of [[Greater Manchester|Manchester]].  The company produced large steam-driven engines for power stations and later for [[Cotton mill|textile mills]] in Lancashire and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=Hills&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
George Saxon was born in [[Manchester]] in 1821. He served an apprenticeship with [[William Fairbairn]], and rose to supervisor. In 1851, he moved to be foreman at Benjamin Goodfellow's works in [[Hyde, Greater Manchester]]. Here in 1854, he invented and patented a [[fusible plug]] for steam boilers. That year he formed his own business at Spring Works, Openshaw, trading as George Saxon. He was a mill-wright. He probably started manufacturing steam engines in 1860. He patented many small improvements to engine design.&lt;ref name=GH3-41&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1998|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected president of the [[Manchester Association of Engineers]] in 1871. He was also a member if the [[Institute of Mechanical Engineers]]. In February 1879 he patented an automatic cut-off motion, which made his engines more economical.&lt;ref&gt;Collier p 224&lt;/ref&gt; He believed in the use of a long cylinder stroke on his horizontal engines to produce more power. His sons followed him into the business and continued it after his death in 1879.&lt;ref name=GH3-41/&gt;

==History==
Up to 1860 Saxon appears to have mainly concentrated on engine repair work and producing mill gearing and shafting. Spring Works was extended in 1860 by the addition of an erecting shop, when engine making seems to have started in a small way, and was further expanded in 1870. An example of an early Saxon engine was one built in the 1860s for a Manchester confectionery firm which was a horizontal single cylinder non-condensing engine, 60&amp;nbsp;ihp, with a [[Meyer expansion valve|Meyer variable cut-off slide valve]]. The construction of larger engines had started by 1870/71 when they built a horizontal cross compound engine, possibly for an Oldham customer, which used steam at the relatively high pressure for that time of 100&amp;nbsp;lbs psi. By 1875 Saxon was building engines of between 750 and 1,000 ihp, for the new 'Oldham Limiteds'. These were mostly horizontal twin tandem compound engines - a 4-cylinder design for which Saxons became noted during the last quarter of the 19th century. During 1871–80 Saxons are known to have built at least 10 engines with a capacity of about 6,800 ihp, mostly for cotton mills.&lt;ref&gt;Collier p 225–226; 265–266&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
George Saxon engines were charactised by having a long stroke and high operating speed.
They used  [[Corliss engine|Corliss valves]] on their large mill engines from around 1890 onwards, having previously used slide valves in their engines. The Saxon design dispensed with the [[wrist plate]] and unusually placed Corliss valves on both the HP (high-pressure) and LP (low-pressure) cylinders where other designers, such as [[McNaught and Petrie]] would have used [[piston valve (steam engine)|piston valve]]s. Saxons were late adopters of Corliss valve engines but were quick to adopt the efficient triple-expansion engine design. During 1891 and 1892 they converted a number of large compound engines to triple-expansion, with a saving in fuel of up to 18%, and in 1892 they built their first horizontal twin tandem triple-expansion engine, 1,260&amp;nbsp;ihp, for [[Rock Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne]].&lt;ref&gt;Collier p 390&lt;/ref&gt; They also continued to build large horizontal twin tandem compound engines. Near-identical engines Saxons built in 1902 for [[Dawn Mill, Shaw]], and [[Magnet Mill, Chadderton]], developed 1400&amp;nbsp;hp at 140&amp;nbsp;psi and 1700&amp;nbsp;hp at 160&amp;nbsp;psi. The flywheels of these engines were 26&amp;nbsp;ft in diameter and weighed between 80 and 90 tons. The speed of 60&amp;nbsp;rpm and stroke of 5&amp;nbsp;ft were standard at this time.&lt;ref name=Hills235&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxons built their first inverted vertical engine in 1896, a space efficient design which became quite popular with mill builders. They built some particularly large engines. In 1908 they built a 2,750 ihp engine for No 2 Mill, Times Mill, Middleton – their largest to be built in the Oldham area.&lt;ref&gt;Collier p 538&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Pear New Mill]], [[Stockport]], and Hall Lane Spinning Mill, Leigh, George Saxon used the Manhattan design. This design was so named because [[Allis-Chalmers]], in designing a 60,000 h.p. engine to generate electricity for the Manhattan transport system, had been faced with a small site, and had laid out the 88-inch-diameter low-pressure cylinders horizontally, and the 44-inch high-pressure cylinders vertically. This had enabled eight strokes per revolution instead of the former four, leading to a smoother motion.&lt;ref name=Hills230&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saxons were very busy during the first decade of the 20th century, especially during 1901–02 and 1905–08. They built 85 engines aggregating 90,240&amp;nbsp;ihp between 1901 and 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Collier p 495&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the advent of the First World War in 1914, their engine output declined rapidly. They also exported a small number of horizontal cross-compound engines to India during the 1890s and early 1900s.

The last mill engine produced by George Saxon is reputed to be one made for J J Hadfield, a bleachworks in [[Chinley]].  This final specimen was built in 1928, and was a 450&amp;nbsp;hp cross-compound engine.  The technical specifications included {{frac|16|1|2}}-inch-diameter HP (high-pressure) cylinder, a 31-inch LP and 3&amp;nbsp;ft 6&amp;nbsp;in stroke.  It was steamed at 120&amp;nbsp;psi, and drove a 16&amp;nbsp;ft flywheel with 12 ropes, at  100&amp;nbsp;rpm.  It had Corliss valves on both cylinders. The  horizontal condenser was behind the LP cylinder.&lt;ref name=AR&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No engines have survived.&lt;ref name=GH3-41/&gt;

This article covers the '''[[history of Sweden]] from the end of [[World War II]] to 1967'''.

==Overview==
[[Sweden]] emerged unharmed by [[Sweden in World War II|World War II]]. The [[Swedish neutrality|Swedish non-alignment policy]] officially remained – Sweden rejected [[NATO]] membership but joined the [[United Nations]] and later [[EFTA]]. [[Tage Erlander]] [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|(s)]] was Prime Minister from 1946 to 1969 – a period of exceptional economic and social prosperity, and generally low [[unemployment]], but the housing situation posed problems as more and more people moved to the cities. Responding to the housing shortage, the government introduced the [[Million Programme]] – a national wave of [[suburban]] development with the aim of creating a million homes from 1965 to 1974. This period saw the beginning of large-scale [[immigration]] to a country that used to be one of the more ethnically homogeneous in the world. The first phase of immigration consisted of workers from [[southern Europe]], who were actively wooed over by campaigns of advertisement and recruitment in their home countries, for instance [[Italy]] &amp; [[Austria]]. In the 1970s and 1980s many refugees with families arrived from e.g. [[Chile]], [[Kurdistan]], [[Vietnam]] &amp; [[Somalia]], some of them with [[refugee]] status, others on the immigration quota. At the same time, the economy was entering less powerfully prosperous times: while Sweden continues to be a thoroughly industrialized nation with many businesses of cutting-edge innovation, especially in telephonics, energy management, chemicals, pharmaceutics &amp; food industry, this growth both in production and complication is not generating a great amount of new employment in Sweden anymore, and therefore did not swallow the generations who have grown up since 1980.

On 3 September 1967, Sweden was the last country in [[continental Europe]] to introduce [[right-hand traffic]]. This was done on [[Dagen H]], in spite of the negative result of a [[Referendums in Sweden|referendum in 1955]].

==Swedish neutrality in the Cold War==
During the [[Cold War]], Sweden maintained a dual approach, publicly the strict [[Neutral country|neutrality]] policy was forcefully maintained but unofficially, strong ties were kept with the U.S. and it was hoped that the U.S. would use conventional and [[nuclear weapon]]s to strike at [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] staging areas in the occupied [[Baltic states]] in case of a Soviet attack on Sweden. Over time and due to the official neutrality [[dogma]], fewer and fewer Swedish military officials were aware of the military cooperation with the west, making such cooperation in the event of war increasingly difficult. At the same time Swedish defensive planning was completely based on help from abroad in the event of war. The fact that it was not permissible to mention this aloud eventually led to the Swedish armed forces becoming highly misbalanced. For example, a strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, while an ability to strike at inland staging areas was almost completely absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foi.se/FOI/templates/Page____537.aspx ''Livlös livlina till väst'' Framsyn 2004, Nr. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707104115/http://www.foi.se/FOI/templates/Page____537.aspx |date=2007-07-07 }}  (The Swedish Defence Research Agency’s bi-monthly publication)&lt;/ref&gt; The political unity among the democratic parties on the neutrality politics where total which made it possible for Sweden to rearm the military.  In the 1970th and 1980th Sweden's military expenditure per capita was the highest in the world. Because of the neutrality politics most of the military equipment was produced and developed in Sweden by companies such as [[Saab Group|SAAB]], [[Kockums]], [[Bofors]] and [[Hägglunds]] (today [[BAE Systems AB]]).  [[Prime minister]] [[Olof Palme]] summarized the Swedish neutrality in a speech in 1985; ''Vi står för Sveriges oberoende i fred och kommer med fasthet att värna vårt territorium mot varje inkräktare ([[english language|en]]: We stand for Sweden's independence in peacetime and will, with firmness, defend our territory against every foreign intruder). ''

In the early 1960s [[Submarines_in_the_United_States_Navy#Cold_War_.281945.E2.80.931991.29|U.S. nuclear submarines]] armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] A-1 were  deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made this a good area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on [[Moscow]]. The submarines had to be very close to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, the same year that the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. Knowledge of this guarantee was by the Swedish governments kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it.

As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help in the development of the [[Saab 37 Viggen]], as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return Swedish scientists at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foi.se/FOI/templates/Page____3941.aspx ''Hemliga atomubåtar gav Sverige säkerhetsgaranti'' Framsyn 2005, Nr. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707104503/http://www.foi.se/FOI/templates/Page____3941.aspx |date=2007-07-07 }} (The Swedish Defence Research Agency’s bi-monthly publication))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population change==
Since 1930, emigration has been slight. About 15,000-30,000 people left Sweden annually after 1965. Sweden welcomed refugees and displaced persons at the end of World War II. Because of the low birth rate, immigration accounted for 45% of population growth between 1945 and 1980. By 1991, 9% of the population had been born abroad. After 1980 immigration again increased rapidly, mostly because of new refugees, reaching more than 60,000 annually by 1990. The increase stirred some anti-immigrant feelings. Already by 1994 there were 508,000 foreign nationals in Sweden, concentrated mainly in the larger cities. The largest groups were [[Finns]] (210,000), [[Yugoslavs]] (70,000), [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]] (48,000), [[Norwegians]] (47,000), [[Danes]] (41,000), and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (29,000). Turks and Iranians make up 8% and 12% respectively of the foreign born non-European population.  Aliens may vote in Swedish local elections after three years of legal residence.&lt;ref&gt;Irena Kogan, "Ex-Yugoslavs in the Austrian and Swedish labour markets: the significance of the period of migration and the effect of citizenship acquisition," '' Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies,'' Volume 29#4 July 2003, pp 595-622&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden became highly urbanized after World War II, reaching 83% urban in 1990 and 85% today. As recently as 1940 only 38% of the population lived in urban areas, and in 1860, before industrialization, the proportion was only 11%. Large-scale movement from the countryside to the United States ended about 1900. Since 1945 the movement to Swedish cities has accelerated and has brought about a population decline in many areas, especially in the north. Most cities are small. Only 10 cities have populations of more than 100,000. The Stockholm metropolitan areas has a population of 2 million; Gothenburg has 906,000 in its metropolitan area and Malmö (including Lund) has 260,000, while the educational center of Uppsala has 130,000.  The only large city in the north is Sundsvall (95,000 in metro area), which grew with the development of the forest industries in the 19th century and now is also a data processing center.

==Culture and mass media==
{{main|Culture of Sweden}}
Cultural influence from the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] has been obvious since the war. Imported and indigenous [[subculture]]s rose, with the [[rockabilly]]-inspired [[raggare]] and anarchist [[progg]] cultures as notable examples. (Before the world wars, Swedish culture was more inspired by [[Germany]]). [[Swedish film]] and [[Swedish music|music]] achieved international fame with names like [[Ingmar Bergman]], [[Sven Nykvist]], [[Lasse Hallström]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[ABBA]], [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]], [[Roxette]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Max Martin]]. Currently, Sweden is the only non-English-speaking country in the world with a net export of music. Most Swedes are today proficient in [[English language|English]], a great deal of Swedish-produced popular music has originally English lyrics, and [[foreign branding|English language branding]] is very common.

The [[sexual revolution]], together with sexual content in mass media (notably films ''[[491 (film)|491]]'' and ''[[I Am Curious (Yellow)]]'', together with the broad entry of women in many lanes of professional life (including the priesthood) in the 1960s and 1970s provoked a [[morality|moralist]] counter-movement including the [[Christian Democrats (Sweden)|Christian Democratic party]], but this trend has had scant political success.

Radio and television early became widespread in Sweden, but government struggled to keep the monopoly of licence-funded [[Sveriges television]] until the late 1980s, as [[satellite TV|satellite]] and [[cable TV]] became popular, and the commercial channel [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]] was permitted to broadcast terrestrially.

==Sports==
Sweden has produced many world-famous athletes during this period, among them boxer [[Ingemar Johansson]], alpine skier [[Ingemar Stenmark]], tennis player [[Björn Borg]] and ice hockey players [[Börje Salming]] and [[Kent Nilsson]]. Sweden has hosted several high-profile sports events, for instance [[equestrianism|equestrian]] events of the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] and the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]].

In March 2003, he voted that the case had not yet been made for war against Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 18 Mar 2003 (pt 47) | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030318/debtext/30318-47.htm#30318-47_div117 | accessdate= 17 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2003, he voted against a motion that would have recalled the Prime Minister's assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction that could be used at 45 minutes' notice, and launching an independent inquiry into the intelligence received and the decisions that were based on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 4 Jun 2003 (pt 25) | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030604/debtext/30604-25.htm#30604-25_div217 | accessdate= 17 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, he voted against a motion calling for an independent inquiry by a committee of [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Counsellors]] into the Iraq War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 11 Jun 2007 (pt 0015) | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070611/debtext/70611-0015.htm#07061179001224 | accessdate= 17 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hywel Francis fought against the closing of Port Talbot's magistrates and the moving of administrative posts to other locations, saying "Local justice needs to take place in a local setting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fears over town's court closure | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/5008452.stm | accessdate= 17 September 2007  | date=24 May 2006 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has suggested that Wales could have a carers' commissioner that could be based on the children's commissioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Carers 'champion' urged for Wales | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/4490490.stm | accessdate= 18 September 2007  | date=2 December 2005 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 it was reported that Francis had been quoted in a [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US diplomatic cable which had been released by Wikileaks]]. The cable by a US embassy political officer dated from 2008, and discussed the upcoming [[Welsh Labour Party leadership election, 2009|Welsh Labour leadership election]] to choose a successor to the retiring [[Rhodri Morgan]]: Francis was quoted as claiming that all of the prospective candidates who were already members of the [[Welsh Assembly]] were seen as flawed by the Welsh Labour Party, and suggesting that many in the party were hoping for a "white knight" to be "parachute(d) in" from outside the Assembly. However, Francis claimed that he could not recall the conversation, suggesting that "it sounds as if the diplomat suffers from poor shorthand", and stating that "it is on the record that I was an early supporter of (Assembly Member and successful leadership candidate) Carwyn Jones... I would certainly not have supported such an absurd suggestion as parachuting anyone into the assembly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-12381300 |title=Wikileaks reveals US cable on 'weak' Welsh devolution |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=7 February 2011 |website=[[bbc.co.uk]] |access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/london-wikileaks/8304732/WALES-WHO-WILL-REPLACE-FIRST-MINISTER-MORGAN-WHEN-HE-RESIGNS.html |title=Wales: Who Will Replace First Minister Morgan When he Resigns? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=4 February 2011 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8482">'''Jack H. Hexter''' (May 25, 1910 – December 8, 1996) was an American historian, a specialist in [[Tudor period|Tudor]] and seventeenth century [[British history]], and well known for his comments on [[historiography]].

==Early career==
Hexter was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] and was awarded a BA by the [[University of Cincinnati]] in 1931.  He received his MA (1933) and PhD (1937) from [[Harvard University]].  His research interests encompassed both political and intellectual history, as witnessed by his first two books, one a history of the parliamentary conflict leading up to the Civil War, and the other a nuanced textual interpretation of [[Thomas More|Thomas More's]] [[Utopia]].

==Scholarship and historiography==
Hexter's scholarly reputation probably owes as much to his historiographical critiques as to his body of research.  He is noted for his distinction between [[lumpers and splitters|"splitters" and "lumpers"]] of historical material, and his 1975 attack on [[Christopher Hill (historian)|Christopher Hill]] (as a "lumper" of selectively read sources). More to Hexter's fancy was the "splitter" who saw his responsibility to the full range of particulars and the ambiguity of historical sources.  "Lumping" was the tendency that, according to Hexter, threatened to bind historians to overreaching generalizations, of which he suggested [[Marxism]] was the most typical and intellectually pernicious.  Nonetheless, his essay appeared to argue that both tendencies (analysis and synthesis) were intellectually necessary.

==Storm over the gentry==
{{see also|Storm over the gentry}}
This attack continued from a position he had earlier assumed, in his response in the late 1950s to a debate between [[Lawrence Stone]] and [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]].  Stone, along with [[R.H. Tawney]], explained the origins of the [[English Civil War]] by positing that an increasingly well-off and ambitious [[gentry]] had, over the course of many years, destabilized the English state in which power had traditionally been divided between the aristocracy and the king.  Trevor-Roper inverted this theory, arguing that in fact the Civil War was caused in part by court gentry who had fallen on bad times.

Hexter's contribution, puckishly titled "The Storm over the Gentry" and originally published in a popular magazine, contends that both theses are undermined by their authors' social determinism which causes them to overlook the ordinary business of the House of Commons.  Hexter maintained that the overlooked group, the rural magnates, the wealthier of the country gentry, wielded the most influence in the House of Commons and had brought no real interest in revolution.  To the contrary, their experience was in practical management and governance, and for the most part they did not act out of simple self-interest.  The Civil War needs, therefore, to be seen as the story of how such solid, service-minded and economically comfortable men were persuaded to resist the King, and not as any particular group's economically motivated power grab.

His ultimate self-definition was overtly, unabashedly, and often polemically [[whiggish]]. For Hexter, the English Civil War was to be seen as the defence of traditional English liberties against an aggressive Crown. This position contrasted in the 1970s with the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] views of [[Conrad Russell]] and others who disputed both the uniqueness of the English Civil War and its connection with ideas of liberty.  However, inasmuch as the revisionists were also explicitly anti-Marxist, their stance owed a great deal to Hexter's critiques.  Russell in particular echoed Hexter's emphasis on continuity in English political values, Hexter's distinction between the Civil War and the subsequent Revolution, and Hexter's belief that contingencies better explained the coming of the War, while rejecting Hexter's view that Parliament was acting out of a clear-cut sense of constitutional obligation and embracing instead the view that religious conflicts and practical problems in the composite monarchy were more decisive.

Hexter in 1978 wrote a bitter historiographical review in which he attacked younger scholars for reducing the analysis of the Civil War to an essentially amoral struggle for power (socio-economic for the Marxists; religious, political and fiscal for the revisionists), which he argued was too dismissive of the intrinsic moral strength of Parliament's position.  He thus declared his preference for the 19th-century narrative by [[Samuel Rawson Gardiner]] over the new interpretation, and, true to form, even adopted an exaggerated Whig-style argument: that one should recognize and accept the principles of the Parliamentary rebels because these ideas about freedom were the very foundation for our modern sense of political liberty.

==Hexter on Braudel==
Another famous Hexterian intervention in [[historiography]] is his article "[[Fernand Braudel]] and the Monde Braudellien," which can be seen as a more appreciative, temperate, and intellectually sophisticated antecedent to Hexter's attack on Hill.  Here, Hexter dissected Braudel's vast "geohistory," ''[[La Mediteranée]]'' marvelling at the organization of the [[Annales School]] but pointing out the ironic tensions between the Annales' rigorous, collaborative, scientific institutional ethos and its leader's passionate, highly personal, often factually inaccurate or poorly sourced book (for which much of the intellectual labor was carried out from memory while Braudel was in a [[prisoner-of-war camp]]).  The article also reveals Hexter's satirical touch, as, in its first section, Hexter mimics the quantitative bent of the Annales scholars, representing their output in a series of graphs and tables.

==Academic positions==
His most prominent academic positions were at [[Queens College of the City University of New York]] from 1938 until 1957, [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1957 until 1964, and at [[Yale University]] from 1964 to 1978, becoming Charles Stillé Professor. The Yale Center for Parliamentary History was founded in 1966 under his directorship. He then returned to [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]], where he founded the [[Center for the History of Freedom]], and was named John M. Olin Professor Emeritus of the History of Freedom at Washington University, retiring in 1990.  In this stead, he served as the founder and editor of the [[Stanford University Press]] ''Making of Modern Freedom'' series of books.

==Family==
Hexter married Ruth Mullin in 1942; they had four children.  He died of congestive heart failure in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] after suffering heart ailments for much of his adult life.

Professor Hen-Tov spent his early employment years as a teacher in the Israeli educational system and subsequently, after training as a journalist, became a correspondent in criminal and legal affairs and later a parliamentary correspondent for the Israeli daily newspaper Herut.  He was also on the staff of the Literary Supplement of both Herut and Haboker (former Israeli daily newspapers).  Upon the completion of his legal studies in Tel-Aviv, he did his internship as a lawyer in the law firm of Dr. Samuel Fischelev (who later served as Israel's Ambassador to the Philippines).

In 1958, Professor Hen-Tov moved to the United States.  After receiving his graduate degrees at Harvard and Brandeis, he was appointed Assistant Professor of Russian Studies at the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and then Professor of History and Political Science at [[Worcester State University]].  From 1971-73, he was a visiting lecturer at the [[University of Haifa]] and the [[Technion&amp;nbsp;– Israel Institute of Technology|Israeli Technion]]. During 1969-72 and 1974–75, he was also an Associate of the Harvard Russian Research Center.

In 1975, Professor Hen-Tov assumed the position of Professor History and Government at the U.S. Army Russian Institute (Department of Defense) in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany]].  In 1993, when the Institute expanded into the George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies, he was appointed as Professor of Eurasian Studies until his retirement in 2003.

In addition to his position at the U.S. Russian Institute (and later the George C. Marshall Center), Professor Hen-Tov was a lecturer of History and Government at the University of Maryland's European Extension Program (1976–96), an Adjunct Associate Professor of Soviet Government at [[Georgetown University]] (1983–84), and an Adjunct Professor of International Relations at the NATO Military Academy-SHAPE, in [[Oberammergau]], [[Germany]] (1981–88).

Professor Hen-Tov also served for many years as a coordinator and moderator for academic conferences in collaboration with centers of strategic studies and military academies in the former Soviet Republics, in particular, in the Caucasus and Central Asia.  As well, as part of his NATO affiliation, he was invited as a speaker to numerous military conferences, among them SACLANT in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk, Va.]], (1984), Sea-Link-NATO, Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, Annapolis, Md. (1984) and the U.S. Sixth Fleet-Intelligence Unit, [[Gaeta, Italy]] (1985).  In 1986, he was one of the keynote speakers on "Military Strength in Today's World" sponsored by the USIS in [[Jerusalem, Israel]] and was designated to present the conference's findings to Chaim Herzog, then President of Israel.

He is currently the leader of the [[IMRO – Bulgarian National Movement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.webcafe.bg/id_1490585911_Dedovite_chervenotikvenicheta |title=Дедовите червенотиквеничета|accessdate=31 March 2014 |date=10 February 2014 |language=Bulgarian |website=webcafe.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ministry of Defence (Bulgaria)|Minister of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.bg/en/ministry_minister.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Krasimir Karakachanov claims that he does not have any roots from the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] region, but as a historian he became a specialist on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vestnikataka.com/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=17856&amp;format=print&amp;edition_id=258|title=Красимир Каракачанов, депутат, лидер на ВМРО: Кандидатурата на Беронов е с предизвестен крах}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Karakachanov was a candidate in the 2016 and [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2011|2011 presidential election]], winning 15% and 1% of all votes cast and placed 3rd and 10th respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://results.cik.bg/tur1/prezidentski/index.html|title=Гласове за избиране на президент и вицепрезидент|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=2011|language=Bulgarian|publisher=cik.bg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140331231124/http://results.cik.bg/tur1/prezidentski/index.html|archivedate=31 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karakachanov took part in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Bulgaria)|2014 European elections]] as part of a coalition bloc with the [[Bulgaria without Censorship]] political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.standartnews.com/balgariya-politika/_balgariya_bez_tsenzura_vmro_i_zns_veche_ofitsialno_sa_koalitsiya-230019.html |title=България без цензура", ВМРО и ЗНС вече официално са коалиция|accessdate=17 May 2014 |date=16 March 2014 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=standartnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 2014, Karakachanov's IMRO left the coalition to form a [[Patriotic Front (Bulgaria)|Patriotic Front]] [[electoral alliance]] together with [[Valeri Simeonov]]'s [[National Front for the Salvation of Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mediapool.bg/vmro-reshi-da-napusne-barekov-zaradi-sayuz-s-nfsb-news223012.html|title=ВМРО реши да напусне Бареков заради съюз с НФСБ|accessdate=12 August 2014 |date=24 July 2014 |language=Bulgarian |publisher=mediapool.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Simeonov, he is the co-spokesman for the electoral bloc.

Before 1989, during the communist era, Karakachanov, being a historian, was an informer of the [[Committee for State Security]] on [[Macedonian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.robert-schuman.eu/en/eem/1161-the-candidate-of-the-ruling-party-rossen-plevneliev-running-favourite-in-the-presidential-election-in-bulgaria-just-one-week-before-the-vote |title=The candidate of the ruling party, Rossen Plevneliev, running favourite in the presidential election in Bulgaria just one week before the vote |work=The European Elections Monitor |publisher=Fondation Robert Schuman |date=17 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2011/09/27/1163815_four-of-bulgarias-presidential-candidates-were-communist-era-state-security-collaborators |title=Four of Bulgaria's presidential candidates were communist-era State Security collaborators |newspaper=The Sofia Echo |date=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karakachanov stood as the candidate of the [[United Patriots]] coalition in the [[Bulgarian presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], with the MP [[Yavor Notev]] of [[Attack (political party)|Attack]] as his vice presidential candidate.

This article lists some but by no means all of the oldest known [[Church (building)|church buildings]] in the world. In most instances, buildings listed here were reconstructed numerous times and only fragments of the original buildings have survived.  These surviving freestanding buildings were purposely constructed for use by congregations (or used at an early date). The dates are the approximate dates when they were first used by congregations for worship.

"Church" may be used in the sense of "[[Christian denomination]]" or in the singular as the [[Christian Church]] as a whole. The "church" (''ecclesia'', assembly) is traced to [[Pentecost]] and the beginning of the [[Christian mission]] in the [[Christianity in the 1st century|first century]] and was not used in reference to a building.

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' the [[Cenacle]] (the site of the [[Last Supper]]) in [[Jerusalem]] was the "first Christian church."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=To the time of Constantine (71–312)|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08355a.htm|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|accessdate=15 November 2013|quote=Certainly no spot in Christendom can be more venerable than the place of the Last Supper, which became the first Christian church.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Archaeology (magazine)|Archaeology]]'' magazine suggests that the [[Dura-Europos church]] in Syria is the oldest surviving church building in the world.&lt;ref name="Dura-Europos"/&gt; While [[Jordan]]'s [[Aqaba Church]] is considered to be the world's first purpose-built church.&lt;ref name="aqaba"/&gt; Several authors have cited the [[Etchmiadzin Cathedral]] ([[Armenia]]'s mother church) as the oldest [[cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Africa and the Middle East|year=2008|publisher=[[Infobase Publishing]]|location=New York|isbn=9781438126760|page=65|editor=Stokes, Jamie|quote=Etchmiatzin is located in the west of modern Armenia, close to the border with Turkey, and its fourth-century cathedral is generally regarded as the oldest in the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhilawala|first=Sakina|title=Armenia|year=1997|publisher=[[Marshall Cavendish]]|location=New York|isbn=9780761406839|page=72|quote=Echmiadzin Cathedral is the spiritual center of the Armenian Church and the seat of the Catholicos of all Armenians.

As a result, they abandoned the Monastery and established a new one which they named after the Theotokos, to emphasize that they believed in Christ's humanity and corruptibility. The Monastery was bought by Syrian Merchants in the eighth century and inhabited by Syrian Monks.

In 405 AD St. Moses heard news that the Monastery was going to be sacked, his disciples wanted to pick up arms and defend their home, however he urged them to either stand as Martyrs with him or escape to neighboring monastic communities. He and 7 others remained in the Church as it was sacked. Later some of his disciples returned and took his body, and the 7 others, with them to Paramous, where they lay today. The Monastery has remained desolate to this day.

|Roman Catholic
|According to tradition, the Apostle [[James, son of Zebedee]] spread Christianity in the Iberian Peninsula. In the year 44 he was beheaded in Jerusalem and his remains were later transferred to Galicia in a stone boat. The king Alfonso II of Asturias ordered the construction of a chapel in 810s in the place. This chapel was followed by a first church in 829 and later by a pre-Romanesque church on 899, gradually becoming an important place of pilgrimage. In 997 this primitive church was reduced to ashes by Almanzor, commander of the army of the Caliphate of Cordoba. The construction of the current cathedral in the same place was built between 1075 and 1122 under the reign of Alfonso VI of León and Castile. The baroque façade of Obradoiro was made in 1740; also baroque is that of Acibecharía; that of Pratarías was built by Master Esteban in 1103; the Pórtico da Gloria, a primordial work of Romanesque sculpture, completed by Master Mateo in 1188.

[[File:35-stalin-marxismandnationalquestion-russiandj.jpg|thumb|''Marxism and the National Question'' was reprinted in the USSR in 1934 as part of the book ''Marxism and the National and Colonial Question'', an English language edition of which first appeared in June 1935.]]

'''''Marxism and the National Question''''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Russian language|Russian]]:&lt;/small&gt; ''Марксизм и национальный вопрос'') is a short work of [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory written by [[Joseph Stalin]] in January 1913 while living in [[Vienna]]. First published as a [[pamphlet]] and frequently reprinted, the essay by the ethnic [[Georgians|Georgian]] Stalin was regarded as a seminal contribution to Marxist analysis of the nature of [[nationality]] and helped to establish his reputation as an expert on the topic. Stalin would later become the first [[People's Commissar of Nationalities]] following the victory of the [[Bolshevik Party]] in the [[October Revolution]] of 1917.

Although it did not appear in the various English-language editions of Stalin's ''Selected Works'', which began to appear in 1928, ''Marxism and the National Question'' was widely republished from 1935 as part of the topical collection ''Marxism and the National and Colonial Question.''

==Content summary==

With his thesis reduced to a single line, Stalin concluded, "A nation is a historically constituted, stable community of people, formed on the basis of a common language, territory, economic life, and psychological make-up manifested in a common culture." In defining a nation in this manner, Stalin took on the ideas of [[Otto Bauer]], for whom a nation was primarily a manifestation of character and culture.&lt;ref name=Tucker152 /&gt; He instead followed [[Karl Kautsky]] in asserting the primacy of language, territory, and integrated economic life without formal acknowledgement of the source.&lt;ref name=Tucker153&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus defined, Stalin took aim at the notion of "national–cultural autonomy," charging that the formulation was but a cloaked form of nationalism in socialist garb.&lt;ref name=Tucker153 /&gt; Stalin argued that such an approach would lead to the cultural and economic isolation of primitive nationalities and that the path forward should be the unification of various and sundry nations and nationalities into a unified stream of higher culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Stalin's Mug Shot.jpg|thumb|Stalin in 1911 mugshots taken by the [[Okhrana|Tsarist secret police]].]]

Ioseb Besarionis Dze Jugashvili (1878–1953), better known by his Anglicized [[pseudonym|party name]] Joseph Stalin, was an ethnic [[Georgians|Georgian]] intellectual and Marxist revolutionary affiliated with the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] wing of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] (RSDLP). Jugashvili regarded Bolshevik leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] (1870–1924) as a role model and intellectual beacon, and the young activist was sometimes jokingly called "Lenin's left foot" by his Georgian comrades.&lt;ref&gt;R. Arsenidze, "Iz vospominanii o Staline" (Reminiscences of Stalin), ''Novyi zhurnal'', no. 72 (June 1963), pg. 223; quoted in Robert C. Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary, 1879–1929: A Study in History and Personality.'' New York: W.W. Norton, 1973; pg. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Jugashvili did not just admire the exiled Lenin from afar through correspondence but had even met him personally, with the pair jointly attending the [[5th Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party|1907 Congress of the RSDLP]] held in London as part of a 92-member Bolshevik delegation.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time he left the seminary (one of the only higher educational channels available to Georgian intellectuals at that time), Jugashvili was a so-called "professional revolutionary", a paid employee of the Bolshevik party organization dedicated full time to revolutionary activity.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to 1910, Jugashvili's main political activity took place in the [[Transcaucasia]]n region of the [[Russian empire]],&lt;ref name=McNealBib10&gt;Robert H. McNeal, ''Stalin's Works: An Annotated Bibliography.'' Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace, 1967; pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; making a home in the [[Azerbaijan]]i oil city of [[Baku]] from 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Jugashvili's helped to organize Marxist [[study circle]]s and worked as an agitator and journalist, writing for the Bolshevik party press.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a reasonably prolific writer during this period, producing no fewer than 56 articles and leaflets. He also preserved pieces of political correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;The count of such items from the years before 1910 officially exceeded 100 although the attribution of some of these items is regarded by specialist historian Robert McNeal as dubious. See: McNeal, ''Stalin's Works'', pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the mass of his written output, Stalin's earliest writing was mainly topical and ephemeral, with only a series of newspaper articles written for the Bolshevik press in opposition to [[anarchism]] during the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] gaining permanence through republication as the pamphlet ''Anarchism or Socialism?''&lt;ref name=Tucker117&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; This first effort at writing a generalized work of Marxist theory in serial form was incomplete, as it was interrupted early in 1907 by Jugashvili's departure from [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] to London for the Bolshevik Congress there and by his subsequent move to Baku.&lt;ref name=Tucker117 /&gt; No additional substantial contribution to theory would be made until the writing of ''Marxism and the National Question'' in 1913.

Despite the paucity of substantial writing, Stalin was well regarded by the Bolshevik leaders in exile, and he was co-opted in absentia to the governing Central Committee of the now independent Bolshevik Party at the 1912 Party Conference held in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=Tucker148&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Jugashvili, now known by his party name "Stalin,"&lt;ref&gt;"Stalin" is a Russian-sounding pseudonym derived from the word ''stal''', steel.&lt;/ref&gt; was at the same time named one of four members of a "Russian Bureau" for the day-to-day direction of the activity of the Bolshevik Party within the borders of the Russian empire by the émigré Copenhagen party conference.&lt;ref name=Tucker148 /&gt;

==Writing==
The actual writing of ''Marxism and the National Question'' began in November 1912, when Stalin traveled to [[Cracow]], Poland to confer with Lenin on Bolshevik party business.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin had published an article earlier that same month condemning nationalist fragmentation of the revolutionary movement, holding up as the disintegration of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] into autonomous German, Czech, Polish, [[Ruthenia]]n, Italian and [[Slovenia|Slovene]] groupings as a grim example.&lt;ref name=Tucker151&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Lenin feared a comparable shattering of the RSDLP along national lines and sought to crush the [[Austro-Marxist]] slogan of "national–cultural autonomy."&lt;ref name=Tucker151 /&gt;

Stalin, as an antinationalist Georgian with no fear of ethnic Russian domination of the RSDLP, was seen both as an expert on the current interrelationship of the various nationalities of Transcaucasia and as a potential national minority voice in favor of maintenance of a centralized and unified party organization.&lt;ref name=Tucker152&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin was set on the task of writing a lengthy article for publication in the Bolshevik theoretical monthly ''Prosveshchenie'' (Enlightenment) detailing an official position on the matter.&lt;ref name=Tucker152 /&gt; Regarding Stalin's assignment to write such an article, Lenin wrote to novelist [[Maxim Gorky]] in February 1913:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"About nationalism, I fully agree with you that we have to bear down harder. We have here a wonderful Georgian who has undertaken to write a long article for ''Prosveshchenie'' after gathering ''all'' the Austrian and other materials. We will take care of this matter."&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, ''Polnoe sobranie sochinenii'' (Complete Collected Works). Moscow: Izdatel'stvo Politicheskoi Literatury, 1964; pg. 162. Quoted in Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The bulk of Stalin's writing took place during January 1913, in Vienna.&lt;ref name=Tucker152 /&gt;

==Publication history==
[[File:35-stalin-marxismandcolonial-usdj.jpg|thumb|upright|The first American edition of ''Marxism and the National and Colonial Question'' (1935).]]

''Marxism and the National Question'' was completed late in January 1913, with the author signing the work "K. Stalin."&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, ''Stalin's Works'', pg. 42. The signature is apparently an amalgam of Jugashvili's two party names, the former pseudonym "Koba" and the new pseudonym "Koba."&lt;/ref&gt; The work first appeared in serial form in the Bolshevik magazine ''Prosveshchenie'' (Enlightenment), with installments appearing in the March, April, and May 1913 issues of that publication.&lt;ref name=McNeal42&gt;McNeal, ''Stalin's Works'', pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The original title of the work as it appeared in 1913 was ''Natsional'nye vopros is Sotsial-Demokratii'' (The National Question and the Social Democracy).&lt;ref name=McNeal42 /&gt; The three articles were combined for republication in pamphlet form as ''Natsional'nyi vopros i Marksizm'' (The National Question and Marxism) in 1914.&lt;ref name=McNeal43&gt;McNeal, ''Stalin's Works'', pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Marxism and the National Question'' was not included in any one- or two-volume Russian version of Stalin's ''Selected Works'' (''Voprosy Leninizma''), which first appeared in 1926, or in any English-language translation of this book appearing from 1928 to 1954. However, the work was reprinted as the lead essay in a 1934 Russian topical collection, ''Markizm i natsional'no-kolonial'nyi vopros'', and its English translations in the following year, ''Marxism and the National and Colonial Question.'' Two nearly simultaneous editions appeared in 1935, one published in Moscow and Leningrad by the Co-operative Publishing Society of Foreign Workers in the USSR (forerunner of the official Foreign Languages Publishing House) and another in New York under the imprint of International Publishers. The new title remained in print thereafter, throughout Stalin's lifetime.

==Authorship controversy==
The exiled leader of the Russian Revolution [[Leon Trotsky]] intimated that primary credit for all that was worthy about ''Marxism and the National Question'' actually belonged to fellow Bolsheviks Lenin and [[Nikolai Bukharin]]. Trotsky wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Stalin's progress on his article is pictured for us with sufficient clarity. At first, leading conversations with Lenin in [[Cracow]], the outlining of the dominating ideas and of the research material. Later, Stalin's journey to Vienna, into the heart of the 'Austrian school.' Since he did not know German, Stalin could not cope with his source material. But there was Bukharin, who unquestionably had a head for theory, knew languages, knew the literature of the subject, knew how to use documents. Bukharin...was under instructions from Lenin to help the 'splendid' but poorly educated Georgian. The logical construction of the article, not devoid of pedantry, is due most likely to the influence of Bukharin, who inclined toward professorial ways...

"From Vienna Stalin returned with his material to Cracow. Here again came Lenin's turn, the turn of the attentive and tireless editor. The stamp of his thought and the traces of his pen are readily discoverable on every page. Certain phrases, mechanically incorporated by the author, or certain lines, obviously written in by the editor, seem unexpected or incomprehensible without reference to the corresponding works of Lenin....

"[[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]] and [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]], who long lived side by side with Lenin, acquired not only his ideas but even his turns of phrase, even his handwriting. That can not be said about Stalin. Of course, he too lived by Lenin's ideas, but at a distance, away from him, and he used them only as he needed them for his own independent purposes. He was too sturdy, too stubborn, too dull and too organic, to acquire the literary methods of his teacher. That is why Lenin's corrections of his text, to quote the poet, look 'like bright patches on dilapidated tatters.'...

"The original manuscript with its corrections can, of course, be hidden. But it is impossible, in any way, to hide the hand of Lenin, as it is impossible to hide the fact that throughout all the years of his imprisonment and exile Stalin produced nothing which even remotely resembles the work he wrote in the course of a few weeks in Vienna and Cracow."&lt;ref&gt;Leon Trotsky, ''Stalin: An Appraisal of the Man and His Influence.'' Charles Malamuth, trans. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1941; pp.157–159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This speculative charge by Trotsky has found its way into the historical literature, echoed by such Stalin biographers as [[Isaac Deutscher]] and [[Bertram D. Wolfe]].&lt;ref name=McNeal43 /&gt; Other historians paying attention to the question have differed, with [[Robert H. McNeal]] concluding that while Lenin "certainly helped form Stalin's ideas on the nationality question before the essay of 1913 was composed" and "probably edited it for republication in 1914," at root "the work remains essentially Stalin's."&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, ''Stalin's Works'', pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin biographer [[Robert C. Tucker]] concurred that "there is no good reason to credit Lenin—as Trotsky did—with virtual authorship of the work."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pg. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that Stalin "needed little if any assistance in those important sections of the work that dealt with the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]] and the national question in the Transcaucasus."&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, ''Stalin as Revolutionary'', pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muhammad Kurd-Ali 1976 stamp of Syria.jpg|thumb|A 1976 stamp of Syria dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the birth of Muhammad Kurd-Ali]]
'''Muhammad Kurd Ali''' ({{lang-ar| '''محمد كردعلي'''}}, 1876–1953) was a notable [[Syrians|Syrian]] scholar, [[historian]] and [[literary critic]] in the [[Arabic language]]. He was the founder and director of the [[Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus]] (1918) till his death.

==Early life==
Muhammad Kurd 'Ali's grandfather was a [[Kurds|Kurd]] born in [[Sulaymaniyah]] in northern Iraq and came to [[Damascus]] in the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Al-Mudhakkirat|last=Kurd Ali|first=Muhammad|publisher=Adwa' al-Salaf|year=2010|isbn=|volume=Vol. 1|location=Riyadh|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was [[Circassians|Circassian]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Kurd 'Ali learned to read and write in the kuttab where he also studied the Koran. He received his preparatory education at Al-Rushdiyya school, and then completed his secondary education at the Azariyya School.

In secondary school he recalled that on the first day he was asked what neighborhood he was from, as the custom was to call students by their first name and the name of their neighborhood as last name. Hailing as he did from Zuqaq Burghul ([[Bulgur]] Alley), by this logic he would have for the rest of his schooling been linked to dried cracked wheat. Thus he lied, and told his teacher that he hailed from the neighborhood of Tadil, which he was familiar with since that is where his father had lived as a boy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Muhammad Kurd 'Ali loved writing and journalism and developed an early interest in reading books and collecting them since childhood. Although illiterate himself, his father encouraged him to acquire books, and gave him sufficient assistance to possess them. As Kurd 'Ali developed more skill in science and language, he started to read newspapers and magazines in French, Turkish and Arabic. At the age of sixteen, he was writing news articles and was paid by newspapers. His vocation did not stop at this point, he loved Arabic poetry and rhyme rhetoric; and he kept close company with well-known local senior scholars at the time, drawing on their knowledge and literature, such as: Saleem Bukhari, Sheikh Mohammed Al Mubarak, and Sheikh Taher Algaza’ri.

==Career in writing==
In 1897, he was entrusted with editing the government weekly newspaper (Sham); he kept this job for three years and was committed in his articles to assonance. Then Kurd 'Ali started corresponding with Al-Muqtataf (excerpt) magazine in Egypt for five years through which his fame spread into Egypt.

Kurd 'Ali afterwards left for Cairo and remained there for ten months during which he worked as the editor of Al-Ra’ed Almasri (the Egyptian pioneer) newspaper. While there, he was introduced to many scientists, literary men and thinkers, which further broadened his horizon and increased his fame so much so that his name in Egypt became no less known than the most famous writers and the very best scholars of that time.

He returned to Damascus only to find himself a victim of a slander that lead to orders by the Turk ruler to have Kurd 'Ali’s house searched, but he was later found innocent. Following this incident, Kurd 'Ali emigrated to Egypt in 1906 and established the monthly Al-Muqtabas (quoted) magazine where he published scientific, literary and historical research; he also edited another two daily newspapers: Al-zaher and Al-Mu’ayyad. Citing from Western magazines, he used to report the latest news on science, civilization, invention and development; in addition to that, he translated a number of rare manuscripts. His work, therefore, was dedicated to the spreading of knowledge, both old and new.

Kurd Ali was also noted for writing [[anti-Shia]] polemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rainer Brünner|title=Islamic Ecumenism In The 20th Century: The Azhar And Shiism Between Rapprochement And Restraint|date=2004|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004125483|page=173|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Politics==
Muhammad Kurd 'Ali returned to Damascus in 1908 after the pronouncement of the Ottoman Constitution, and published the Al-Muqtabas magazine in addition to another daily newspaper he called Al-Muqtabas in collaboration with his brother Ahmed; he also founded its own press. But,under the Ottoman rule, he was subject to continuous harassment and restriction in the form of censorship and close monitoring of his writing and thinking; and as an example of that his newspaper was closed after one of the Turk rulers accused him of discussing the Sultan’s family in one of his articles. Kurd 'Ali again fled to Egypt and then to Europe, but he returned later after he had been exonerated. These forms of harassment continued to haunt him until Kurd 'Ali finally handed the responsibility for the daily newspaper to his brother Ahmed and dedicated himself to the magazine. He became increasingly more apprehensive after the declaration of the First World War and the start of a revenge campaign by the Ottoman rulers against the ‘free Arabs’, who sought more political freedoms; so he closed the magazine and the newspaper. During this campaign Kurd 'Ali himself was almost driven to the gallows like many other freedom advocates and critics of the Ottoman regime; he was, however, spared thanks to a document found in the French consulate in Damascus written by a worker in the French Foreign Ministry before the war. According to the document, the French agent had approached Kurd 'Ali and, exploiting his dislike to the pro-Ottomans, he induced him to take a more positive approach towards the pro-French policy in the Middle East; but Kurd 'Ali's response was rather negative and he urged the French to alter their policy in Algeria and Tunisia. Similar documents like this included the 'official publication of confidentiality' that had been sent by the French ambassador in Istanbul to French consuls in Syria warning them from Kurd 'Ali and stating that: 'he only works with the Turks'. This came as a favourable evidence together with other papers of this kind found during the inspection of foreign consulates early in the war. Following this, Djemal Pasha summoned Kurd 'Ali and jubilantly informed him of this news but also warned him that should Kurd 'Ali turn to opposition again, Djamal Pasha threatened to kill him with his own pistol. He then ordered the newspaper to open again and gave Kurd 'Ali financial assistance; he then appointed him editor of Al-Sharq (the East) newspaper which was issued by the army.

After entering the Faisali Covenant and the independence of Syria from the Ottoman Empire, Kurd 'Ali found the opportunity to fulfill the dream that he had had for long: the establishment of an Arab Academy in Damascus in a similar manner like in other civilized nations with the aim of saving the Arabic heritage and protecting and developing the Arabic language as a vehicle for disseminating literature and sciences. So, he presented the idea to the military ruler then Rida Pasha al-Rikabi, who agreed to convert the Court of knowledge into an Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus. This was achieved in the eighth of June 1919, and Muhammad Kurd 'Ali was appointed president of the Assembly and continued to be so until his death.

==Heritage==
Kurd 'Ali cherished the Academy more than anything and looked at it as the one gift of his whole life and the fruit of all his strife so much so that he would not absent himself from any of the Academy's meetings. Mohammad Kurd 'Ali was a pioneer in journalism, and an authority on investigative journalism; he made a name for himself in writing and authorship and was one of the leading scholars in the Arab world. He is accredited as the first to establish high-quality newspaper and magazine in Damascus, and the first to establish an Arab Science Assembly in the Arab world.

The style of his writing has been described as ‘easy but impossible’. It is characterised with bland expression and verbal eloquence; and it uses words loaded with semantic power, and sentences varying in length. His style is said to move away from affectation and aims to focus on the meaning, avoiding undue emphasis on the structure. In much of what he had written, Kurd 'Ali is sometimes argued to follow the same course of the writing as that of Ibn Khaldoun in his ''Introduction''.

Muhammad Kurd 'Ali assumed several jobs and positions in the press, in the university, in the Ministry, in the Arab Science Assembly in Damascus, and in the language Council in Egypt. He assumed the Ministry of Education twice in the era of the French occupation. He fills a prestigious literary and scientific place among his peers of other influential Arab scholars. His writings reached the number of twenty-two authorships including:

*''Khitat al sham'' (Description of Syria) six volumes, one of his most important works.
*''Al Islam wa al hadara al arabiya'' (Islam and Arab civilization) two volumes.
*''Tareekh al hadara'' (History of civilization) are two parts, translated from French.
*''Ghara'eb al gharb'' (Oddities of the West) two volumes.
*''Akwalana wa af'alana'' (Our words and deeds) two volumes.
*''Dimashq, madinat al sihr wa al shi'r'' (Damascus, city of charm and poetry).
*''Ghaber al andalus wa hadoroha'' (The Past of Andalusia and its Present).
*''Omara 'o al biaan'' (Princes of Eloquency) are two parts.
*''Al kadeem wa al hadeeth'' (The Old and the New), which is a selection of his articles.
*''Konoz al ajdad'' (Ancestors' Treasures).
*''Al idara al islamiya fi iz al arab'' (The Islamic Administration under Arabs).
*''Ghotat Dimashq'' (The Oasis of Damascus)
*''Almozakart'' (The Diaries) four parts.

Muhammad Kurd 'Ali died On Thursday of April 2, 1953 in Damascus, and was buried beside the tomb of Muawiya bin Abi Sufyan in Damascus.

{{italic title}}
'''''New Lands''''' was the second nonfiction book of the author [[Charles Fort]], published in 1923.  It deals primarily with [[Astronomy|astronomical]] anomalies.

Fort expands in this book on his theory about the [[Super-Sargasso Sea]] – a place where earthly things supposedly materialize in order to rain down on Earth – as well as developing an idea that there are continents above the skies of Earth.  As evidence, he cites a number of anomalous phenomena, including strange "[[mirage]]s" of land masses, groups of people, and animals in the skies.  He also continues his attacks on scientific [[dogma]], citing a number of mysterious stars and planets that scientists failed to account for.

Of all of Fort's books, ''New Lands'' is the worst-regarded.  His speculations (serious or joking, he does not reveal) concerning continents in the sky and the supposed top-like shape of the Earth have dated considerably.

''New Lands'' is available in [[Dover Publications]]' ''The Complete Works of Charles Fort'' with Fort's other paranormal writings, and an edited online version is linked below.

[[File:Map showing percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire, c. 1905.png|thumb|Map showing percentage of Jews in the Pale of Settlement in the Russian Empire c. 1905]]

The '''Pale of Settlement''' ({{lang-ru|Черта́ осе́длости}}, ''{{transl|ru|chertá osyédlosti}}'', {{lang-yi|דער תּחום-המושבֿ}}, ''{{transl|yi|der tkhum-ha-moyshəv}}'', {{lang-he-n|תְּחוּם הַמּוֹשָב}}, ''{{transl|he|tẖum hammosháv}}'') was a western region of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] with varying borders that existed from 1791 to 1917, in which permanent residency by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jews]] was allowed and beyond which Jewish residency, permanent or temporary,&lt;ref&gt;[http://eleven.co.il/article/14679 Черта оседлости.  КЕЭ, том 9, кол. 1188–1198]&lt;/ref&gt; was mostly forbidden. Most Jews were still excluded from residency in a number of cities within the Pale as well. A limited number of Jews were allowed to live outside the area, including those with university education, the ennobled, members of the most affluent of the merchant guilds and particular [[artisan]]s, some military personnel and some services associated with them, including their families, and sometimes the servants of these. The archaic English term ''pale'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''{{lang|la|[[:wikt:palus#Latin|palus]]}}'', a stake, extended to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.&lt;ref&gt;"pale, n.1." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Retrieved October 24, 2016. [[The Pale]] was the part of medieval [[Ireland]] controlled by the English government.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pale of Settlement included all of [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Moldova]], much of present-day [[Ukraine]], parts of eastern [[Latvia]], eastern [[Poland]], and some parts of western [[Russia]], roughly corresponding to the [[Kresy]] macroregion and modern-day western border of Russia. It extended from the eastern ''pale'', or demarcation line, to the Russian border with the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] (later the [[German Empire]]) and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]]. Furthermore, it comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and largely corresponded to historical lands of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Cossack Hetmanate]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (with [[Crimean Khanate]]).

The Russian Empire in the period of the existence of the Pale was predominantly [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]. The area included in the Pale, with its large Jewish, [[Uniate]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] populations, was acquired through a series of military conquests and diplomatic maneuvers, between 1654 and 1815. While the religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale are clear (conversion to [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], the state religion, released individuals from the strictures), historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and [[nationalist]]ic in nature.

The end of the enforcement and formal demarcation of the Pale coincided with the beginning of the [[World War I|First World War]], and ultimately with the [[February Revolution|February]] and [[October Revolution]]s of 1917, i.e., the fall of the Russian Empire.

The Pale was first created by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1791, after several failed attempts by her predecessors, notably the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]], to remove Jews from Russia entirely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people = Producer,  director, production company unknown |date= October 24, 2011 |year= |title= История России, 7.

The institution of the Pale became more significant following the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, since, until then, Russia's Jewish population had been rather limited;{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} the dramatic westward expansion of the Russian Empire through the annexation of Polish-Lithuanian territory substantially increased the Jewish population.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At its height, the Pale, including the new Polish and Lithuanian territories, had a Jewish population of over five million, and represented the largest component (40 percent) of the world Jewish population at that time.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

From 1791 to 1835, and until 1917, there were differing reconfigurations of the boundaries of the Pale, such that certain areas were variously open or shut to Jewish residency, such as the [[Caucasus]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} At times, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities, or certain cities, (as in [[Kiev]], [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]]), and were forced to move to small provincial towns, thus fostering the rise of the ''[[shtetl]]s.''{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Jewish merchants of the First Guild ({{lang|ru|купцы первой гильдии}}, the wealthiest ''[[sosloviye]]'' of merchants in the Russian Empire), people with higher or special education, University students, [[artisan]]s, army tailors, ennobled Jews, soldiers (drafted in accordance with the Recruit Charter of 1810), and their families had the right to live outside the Pale of Settlement.&lt;ref name="jewishfamilysearch.com"&gt;{{cite web | author = Jankowski, Tomasz [attr.] | date = May 3, 2014 | title= Who could live outside the Pale of Settlement? |  url=http://jewishfamilysearch.com/pale-of-settlement/ | format = blogpost | work=JewishFamilySearch.com | access-date=September 29, 2016 | quote = [Presents 14 groups of Jews to whom permission might be granted to live outside of the Pale, indicating additional conditions, and presenting three reasons for temporary permissions to leave, for the 13 governates of the Russian Empire; the bogpost is by an academic historian, and states: 'These rules was regulated by the Law on Social Estates and the Law on Passports printed in vol. 9 and 14 of Свод законов Российской империи.']}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=September 2016}} In some periods, special dispensations were given for Jews to live in the major imperial cities, but these were tenuous, and several thousand Jews were expelled to the Pale from [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] as late as 1891.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

During World War I, the Pale lost its rigid hold on the Jewish population when large numbers of Jews fled into the Russian interior to escape the invading German army.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} On March 20 (April 2 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]]), 1917, the Pale was abolished by the [[Russian Provisional Government, 1917|Provisional Government]] [[decree]], ''On abolition of confessional and national restrictions'' ({{lang-ru|Об отмене вероисповедных и национальных ограничений}}).{{cn | date=March 2016}}  A large portion of the Pale, together with its Jewish population, [[history of the Jews in Poland|became part of Poland]].{{cn | date=March 2016}} Subsequently, most of this population would perish in [[The Holocaust]] one generation later.

==Jewish life in the Pale==

[[File:Pale teacher.jpg|thumb|223px|Right|A Jewish teacher in 19th century [[Podolia]]]]

Jewish life in the [[shtetl]]s ({{lang-yi|שטעטלעך}} ''{{transl|yi|shtetlekh}}'' "little towns") of the Pale of Settlement was hard and poverty-stricken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0018_0_18416.html |title=Shtetl |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]], The Gale Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Jewish religious tradition of ''[[tzedakah]]'' (charity), a sophisticated system of volunteer Jewish [[social welfare]] organizations developed to meet the needs of the population. Various organizations supplied clothes to poor students, provided [[kosher]] food to Jewish soldiers conscripted into the [[Imperial Russian Army|Tsar's army]], dispensed free medical treatment for the poor, offered dowries and household gifts to destitute brides, and arranged for technical education for orphans. According to historian Martin Gilbert's ''Atlas of Jewish History'', no province in the Pale had less than 14% of Jews on relief; Lithuanian and Ukrainian Jews supported as much as 22% of their poor populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aish.com/jl/h/48956361.html|title=History Crash Course #56: Pale of Settlement|author=Rabbi Ken Spiro|date=|work=aish.com|accessdate=19 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration of Jews in the Pale, coupled with Tzar Alexander III's "fierce hatred of the Jews", and the rumors that Jews had been involved in the assassination of his father [[Tzar Alexander II]] made them easy targets for [[pogrom]]s and anti-Jewish riots by the majority population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Romanovs -- 1613 to 1918|last=Montifiore|first=Simon Sebag|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=463–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These, along with the repressive [[May Laws]], often devastated whole communities.{{cn|date=September 2016}} Though attacks occurred throughout the existence of the Pale, particularly devastating [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Jewish pogroms]] occurred from 1881–83 and from 1903–1906,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Modern Jewish History: Pogroms |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/pogroms.html |work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]], The Gale Group |date=2008 |accessdate=19 August 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; targeting hundreds of communities, assaulting thousands of Jews, and causing considerable property damage.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

One outgrowth of the concentration of Jews in a circumscribed area was the development of the modern [[yeshiva]] system.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Until the beginning of the 19th century, each town supported its own advanced students who learned in the local [[synagogue]] with the rabbinical head of the community. Each student would eat his meals in a different home each day, a system known as ''{{lang|yi|essen teg}}'' ("eating days").{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

After 1886, the [[Jewish quota]] was applied to education, with the percentage of Jewish students limited to no more than 10% within the Pale, 5% outside the Pale and 3% in the capitals of Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Kiev.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The quotas in the capitals, however, were increased slightly in 1908 and 1915.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Amidst the difficult conditions in which the Jewish population lived and worked, the courts of [[Hasidism|Hasidic]] dynasties flourished in the Pale.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Thousands of followers of [[rebbe]]s such as the Gerrer Rebbe [[Yehudah Aryeh Leib Alter]] (known as the ''Sfas Emes''), the Chernobyler Rebbe, and the Vizhnitzer Rebbe flocked to their towns for the [[Jewish holiday]]s and followed their rebbes' ''[[minhag]]im'' (Jewish practices) in their own homes.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The tribulations of Jewish life in the Pale of Settlement were immortalized in the writings of [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] authors such as humorist [[Sholom Aleichem]], whose novel ''{{lang|yi|Tevye der Milchiger}}'' (Tevye the Milkman) (in the form of the narration of [[Tevye]] from a fictional shtetl of Anatevka to the author) form the basis of the theatrical (and subsequent film) production ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Because of the harsh conditions of day-to-day life in the Pale, some two million Jews emigrated from there between 1881 and 1914, [[History of the Jews in the United States|mainly to the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronnie S. Landau (1992) ''The Nazi Holocaust''. IB Tauris, London and New York: 57&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Passion Play''' or '''Easter pageant''' (senakulo) is a dramatic [[Play (theatre)|presentation]] depicting the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] of [[Jesus Christ]]: his [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|trial]], suffering and death. It is a traditional part of [[Lent]] in several [[Christian denominations]], particularly in [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] tradition.

==Origin and history==
[[File:Cristo ya esta crucificado en san simon texcoco.JPG|thumb|Reenactment of the crucifixion of Jesus in [[Texcoco, State of Mexico|Texcoco]], Mexico]]

===The Easter play precedent===
The development of the Passion Play was about the same as that of the [[Easter Drama]]. It originated in the [[ritual]] of the [[Christian Church|Church]], which prescribes, among other things, that the [[Gospel]] on [[Good Friday]] should be sung in parts divided among [[performers|various persons]]. Later on, the Passion Play made its appearance, first in [[Latin]], then in [[vernacular]] languages; contents and forms were adapted more and more to [[audience]] expectations, until, in the fifteenth century, the popular religious plays had developed. The '''Benedictbeurn Passion Play''' (thirteenth century) is still largely composed of Latin ritual sentences in [[prose]] and of church [[hymns]], and, being designed to be sung, resembles an [[oratorio]].

===Addition of music and characters===
Yet even this oldest of the Passion Plays already shows a tendency to break away from the ritual and to adopt a more [[dramatic structure|dramatic form]].  This evolution is shown by the interpolation of free translations of church hymns and of German verses not pertaining to such hymns, as well as by the appearance of Mary (the Virgin [[Mary, mother of Jesus]]) and [[Mary Magdalene]] in the action. From these humble beginnings the Passion Play developed very rapidly, since in the fourteenth century it was at a stage of development which could not have been reached except by [[rehearsal|repeated practice]]. From this second period we have the '''Vienna Passion''', the '''St. Gall Passion''', the oldest '''Frankfort Passion''', and the '''Maestricht Passion'''. All four Plays, as they are commonly called, are written in [[rhyme]], principally in German.

===Expansion===
The '''Vienna Passion''' embraces the entire history of the [[Redemption (religious)|Redemption]], and begins with the revolt and [[fallen angel|fall]] of [[Lucifer]]; the play, as transmitted to us, ends with Jesus and his [[Twelve Apostles]] sitting at [[the Last Supper]].

The oldest '''Frankfort Passion''' play, that of Canon Baldemar von Peterwell (1350–1381), the production of which required two days, was more profusely elaborated than the other Passion Plays of this period. Of this play only the ''[[Ordo sive Registrum]]'' has come down to us, a long roll of [[parchment]] for the use of the director, containing [[stage directions]] and the first words of the [[dialogue (fiction)|dialogues]]. The plays based on this list of directions lead us to the period in which the Passion Play reached its highest development (1400–1515). During this period the later Frankfort Passion Play (1467), the '''Alsfelder''', and the '''Friedberger''' (1514) originated. Connected with this group are the '''Eger''', the '''Donaueschingen''', '''Augsburg''', '''Freising''' and '''Lucerne''' Passion Plays, in which the whole world drama, beginning with the [[creation of man]] and brought down to the [[Pentecost|coming of the Holy Ghost]], is exhibited, and which was produced with great splendour as late as 1583.

==The Tyrolese Passion Play==
===Expansion and consolidation of previous plays===
Nearly all these Passion Plays have some relation to those coming from the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], some contributing to, others taking from, that source. These, again, are founded upon the '''Tyrolese Passion''' play which originated during the transition period of the fourteenth to the fifteenth century. Historian J. E. Wackernell, with the aid of the plays that have reached us, has reconstructed this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wackernell|first1=Josef E.|title=Altdeutsche Passionsspiele aus Tirol. Mit Abhandlungen über ihre Entwicklung, Composition, Quellen, Aufführungen und literarhistorische Stellung (= Quellen und Forschungen zur Geschichte, Litteratur und Sprache Österreichs und seiner Kronländer I)|language=German|trans-title=Old German Passions Plays from Tyrol|date=1897|publisher=Styria|location=Graz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tyrol the Passion Plays received elaborate cultivation; at [[Bozen|Bolzan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;o they were presented with great splendour and, in 1514, lasted no less than seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://cma.gbv.de/dr,cma,007,2004,a,07.pdf |title=The Social Stages of the City. Vigil Raber and Performance Direction in Bozen/Bolzano (Northern Italy) – A Socio-Historical Outline |first=Hannes |last=Obermair |journal=Concilium Medii Aevi |year=2004 |volume=7 |issue= |pages=193–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, too, the innovation of placing the female [[role (performing arts)|roles]] in the hands of women was introduced, which innovation did not become general until during the seventeenth century.

===Elaborate, public productions===
The magnificent productions of the Passion Plays during the fifteenth century are closely connected with the growth and increasing self-confidence of the cities, which found its expression in noble buildings, ecclesiastical and municipal, and in gorgeous public festivals. The artistic sense and the [[Aesthetics|love of art]] of the citizens had, in co-operation with the clergy, called these plays into being, and the wealth of the citizens provided for magnificent productions of them on the public squares, whither they migrated after expulsion from the churches. The citizens and civil authorities considered it a point of honour to render the production as rich and diversified as possible. Ordinarily the preparations for the play were in the hands of a spiritual brotherhood, the play itself being considered a form of [[worship]]. People of the most varied classes took part in the production, and frequently the number of actors was as high as two hundred and even greater. If was undoubtedly no small task to drill the performers, particularly since the [[set design|stage arrangements]] were still very primitive.

===Staging and set design===
The [[Stagecraft|stage]] was a wooden structure, almost as broad as it was long, elevated but slightly above the ground and open on all sides. A house formed the background; a [[balcony]] attached to the house represented [[Heaven]]. Under the balcony three [[cross]]es were erected. Sometimes the stage was divided into three sections by [[stage door|doors]]. Along the sides of the stage, taken lengthwise, stood the houses required for the production; they were indicated by fenced-in spaces, or by four posts upon which a roof rested. The [[Gates of Hell|entrance into]] [[Hell]] was pictured by the mouth of a monster, through which the [[Devil]] and the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]s captured or released during the plays passed back and forth. The actors entered in solemn procession, led by musicians or by a præcursor ([[herald]]), and took their stand at the places appointed them. They remained on the stage all through the performance; they sat on the barriers of their respective divisions, and were permitted to leave their places only to [[dialogue (fiction)|recite]] their lines. As each actor finished speaking, he returned to his place. The audience stood around the stage or looked on from the windows of neighbouring houses. Occasionally platforms, called "bridges", were erected around the stage in the form of an [[amphitheatre]].

===Simplicity of scenery, dialog, action, and costumes===
The [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]] was the background of old time middle east. There were no side [[scene (fiction)|scenes]], and consequently no stage perspective. Since an illusion of reality could not be had, indications were made to suffice. Thus a cask standing on end represents the mountain on which Christ is tempted by the Devil; [[thunder]] is imitated by the report of a gun; in order to signify that the Devil had [[Demonic possession|entered into him]], [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] holds a bird of black plumage before his mouth and makes it flutter. The suicide of Judas is an execution, in which [[Beelzebub]] performs the hangman's duty. He precedes the culprit up the ladder and draws Judas after him by a [[rope]]. Judas has a black bird and the [[intestines]] of an animal concealed in the front of his clothing, and when Satan tears open the garment the bird flies away, and the intestines fall out, whereupon Judas and his executioner slide down into Hell on a rope. A [[painting|painted picture]] representing the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], is hung from the mouth of each of the two [[thief|thieves]] on the cross; an [[angel]] takes the soul of the [[penitent]], the devil that of the impenitent thief. Everything is presented in the concrete, just as the [[imagination]] of the audience pictures it, and the scenic conditions, resembling those of the antique theatre demand. All [[costume]], however, is contemporary, historical accuracy being ignored.

===Secularization of the Passion Play===
The Passion Plays of the 15th century, with their peculiar blending of religious, artistic, and increasingly secular [[Dramatic structure|elements]], gave a true picture of German city life of those times. Serious thought and lively humour were highly developed in these plays. When, however, the [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]], in the sixteenth century, withdrew more and more from the plays, the plays, left to the lower classes, began to lose their serious and (in spite of the comic traits) dignified character. The influence of the Carnival plays (Fastnachtspiele) was felt more and more. Master Grobianus with his coarse and [[obscenity|obscene]] jests was even introduced into some of the Passion Plays. In time the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities forbade the production of these "secularized"{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} plays. Thus, the [[Bishop of Havelberg]] commanded his clergy, in 1471, to suppress the Passion Plays and legend plays in their parish districts because of the disgraceful and irrelevant [[farce]]s interspersed through the productions.

===Secularized Passion Plays banned===
With the advent of the 16th-century European religious conflict the uneasiness with [[liturgical drama]] in general increased. The [[Synod]] of [[Strasbourg|Strasburg]] of 1549 opposed the religious plays, and the year previous, in 1548, the [[Parliament of Paris]] forbade the production of ''The Mysteries of the Passion of our Redeemer and other Spiritual Mysteries''. One consequence was that the secularized plays were separated from the religious, and, as Carnival plays, held the public favour. The Passion Plays came to be presented more rarely, particularly as the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] was inimical to them.

==Rediscovery of the Passion Play==
===The Passion Play almost disappears===
School dramas now came into vogue in Catholic and Protestant schools, and frequently enough became the battle-ground of religious [[controversies]]. When, in the 17th century, the splendidly equipped [[Jesuit drama]] arose, the Passion Plays (still largely secularized) were relegated to out-of-the-way [[villages]] and to the [[monasteries]], particularly in [[Bavaria]] and [[Austria]]. Towards the end of the eighteenth century, during the [[The Enlightenment|Age of Enlightenment]], efforts were made in Catholic Germany, particularly in Bavaria and the Tyrol, to destroy even the remnants of the tradition of [[medieval]] plays.

===A resurgence of public interest===
Public interest in the Passion Play developed in the last decades of the 19th century, and the statistician [[Karl Pearson]] wrote a book about them.

Since then, [[Brixlegg]] and Vorderthiersee in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [http://www.ckrumlov.cz/uk/region/histor/t_pasije.htm Horice na Sumave, near Cesky Krumlov] in the [[Czech Republic]], and above all, the [[Oberammergau]] in [[Upper Bavaria]] attract thousands to their plays.

The text of the play of Vorderthiersee (''Gespiel in der Vorderen Thiersee'') dates from the second half of the seventeenth century, is entirely in verse, and comprises in five [[Act (theater)|acts]] the events recorded in the Gospel, from the Last Supper to the Entombment. A prelude (Vorgespiel), on the [[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|Good Shepherd]], precedes the play. After being repeatedly remodelled, the text received its present classical form from the Austrian [[Benedictine]], [[P. Weissenhofer]]. Productions of the play, which came from Bavaria to the Tyrol in the second half of the eighteenth century, were arranged at irregular intervals during the first half of the nineteenth century; since 1855 they have taken place at regular intervals, at Brixlegg every ten years. The Höritz Passion Play, the present text of which is from the pen of Provost Landsteiner, has been produced every five years, since 1893.

==Modern performances of the Passion Play==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}

===Australia===
In Australia, several major productions of The Passion are staged annually during the lead up to Easter.
* The Iona Passion Play was founded in 1958 in [[Queensland]], and tours cities and towns around Australia. In each location the touring cast invites community members to join the production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=passionplay.org|title=The Iona Passion Play|location=Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Moogerah Passion Play'', established in 1993, is produced annually, at Easter time, in [[Queensland]]. It is staged "realistically" at The Lake Theatre, a large, purpose built, lakeside theatre designed specifically for the Moogerah Passion Play. Contemporary versions of the play endeavour to use different Bibles to convey messages to the audience every year.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[File:Thelaketheatre.jpg|thumb|The Lake Theatre, Moogerah Queensland Australia]]
* In [[New South Wales]], at [[Turramurra]], ''The Turramurra Passion'' is a contemporary, character-driven interpretation, using multimedia elements and an original score.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* In the Riverstage botanical gardens, in [[Brisbane, Queensland]], a new group of enthusiastic people staged a version of the Passion Play, with an original score and script written by Roy Pires, that was staged for the first time in 2007. It "was very successful, touching the lives of many people".{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Bavaria===
[[File:Oberammergau Theatre IMG 4083.JPG|thumb|Oberammergau Theatre (2013)]]
The chief survivor of former times is the [[Oberammergau Passion Play]], first performed in the Bavarian village of [[Oberammergau]] in 1634 and now performed every 10 years. The next Oberammergau Passion Play will take place in 2020.

In 2010, about half the inhabitants of Oberammergau took part in the once-a-decade Passion Play; over 2,000 villagers brought the story of Jesus of Nazareth to life for audiences that flocked in from around the world. In accordance with tradition, the play started with Jesus entering Jerusalem, continued with his death on the cross, and finished with the Resurrection.

2010 saw a new production directed by Christian Stückl, director at Munich's noted Volkstheater. He was supported by the artistic team that, along with him, staged the 2000 Passion Play: deputy director and dramatic adviser Otto Huber, set and costume designer Stefan Hageneier, music director Marxus Zwink, and conductor Michael Bocklet. All four of these collaborators are from Oberammergau. The play started at 14.30 and included a three-hour interval, ending at 22.30. Performances took place between mid-May and early October 2010.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Italy=== 
[[File:Sight scenography.jpg|right|thumb|Overall view of the scenography in 2015 in [[Sordevolo]], Italy]]

In front of the audience is rebuilt a corner of Jerusalem.Every actor involved (about 500 people) is a volunteer, as well as who works "behind the scenes"(about 300 people) for scenography, costumes, script, horses. It is one of the greatest shows about the Passion of Christ in Italy, sacred in the topic, popular in its realization. About 40 shows are performed for each season. The next edition will take place in 2020 (from 13th June to 27th September).

===Brazil===

The Passion of the Christ is performed every year during Easter, in a purpose-built {{convert|100000|m2|adj=on}} theatre-city in the arid backlands of [[Pernambuco]], in northeastern [[Brazil]]. It is considered to be the largest open-air theatre in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Thousands of visitors arrive every year to watch the performance; over 500 actors appear on the nine separate stages within the stone walls of the [[New Jerusalem theater|New Jerusalem]] city-theatre.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Canada===
* [[The Canadian Badlands Passion Play]] is performed annually in [[Drumheller]], Alberta. It is staged outdoors in a naturally occurring [[amphitheatre]] in the hills of the Drumheller valley. Performers are a mix of professionals and volunteers from across Alberta and Canada, with nearly 300 actors and musicians annually.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* In [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Cardinal Newman Catholic Secondary School puts on a Passion Play annually for all the students who attend it.
* In [[Kingston, Ontario]], a full-scale Passion Play production has been traditionally performed for decades at the [[Kingston Gospel Temple]], a Pentecostal worship center.  The production features local amateur and professional talent.
* In [[Manitoba]], located in the La Riviere Valley at Oak Valley's Outdoor theatre, located on the edge of the valley among the natural beauty of the Pembina Valley. The cast and crew are volunteers from all over southern Manitoba. Rehearsals usually start in April or early May and are ready for mid-July performances.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
* In [[Thornhill, Ontario]], in what has become an annual tradition at St. Joseph the Worker Parish, over 200 parish youth and young adults annually come together to present the LIfe and Passion of Christ, the decisive event in history that gave victory to hope, love, light, and life. Every year, the StJW Parish Passion Play increases in quality and number as the bar continues to be raised. Funds raised from the Passion Play go to subsidize the StJW Youth's annual trip to the Steubenville Youth Conference.
* In [[Queensway Cathedral]] ([[Toronto]], Ontario) a Passion Play takes place during the Easter Season. For more than 20 years, the Church on the Queensway (formally Queensway Cathedral) has presented different versions of the Passion Play in their 3200-seat venue, using hundreds of volunteers, live animals, singers and dancers.  The play has become a favorite, and most shows experience capacity crowds.  This presentation is known for its powerful portrayal of the life of Christ, dramatic resurrection, and ascension scenes. {{citation needed|date=March 2016}}
*There is also a well-known Passion Play in [[Vaughan, Ontario]], organized by St. Peters Parish and performed at [[Holy Cross Catholic Academy]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Hungary===
[[File:Budaörs Passion Play 2018 (2).jpg|thumb|Budaörs Passion Play 2018]]
Kőhegy (Stone Mountain) Chapel at Budaörs was built by Franz Wendler to whom Virgin Mary had appeared in a dream. He supposedly dreamt of a dog rose on Stone Mountain, every flower of which bore the face of Mary. On the petals he read: “I am the Immaculate Conception”. In spring 1855, Wendler started construction. On October 15, 1855, the chapel was consecrated to Mary’s Immaculate Conception. Franz Wendler lived in a cave next to the chapel from 1878 until his death. The chapel is one of the most important pilgrimage places for Germans of Hungary in the area of Buda.Every three years, Budaörs’ inhabitants stage a passion play with Hungarian and German text.

===Malta===
The island nation of [[Malta]] features many Passion Plays, put on by provincial club, societies, and theatres in various localities. Each village and town often hosts several plays, and there is some competition among the troupes to put on the most moving or beautiful display. These are often combined with processions and ''wirjiet'' ("exhibitions") that feature models and renditions of the Passion.

Since 2007, a Passion Play entitled [https://www.facebook.com/pages/Il-Mixja-2013/545028902185445 "Il-Mixja"], with Jesus being played by popular Maltese actor Alan Fenech and featuring some of the most highly acclaimed actors in Malta has become one of the highlights of the genre on the island with the audience experiencing the passion of Jesus Christ as if they were present on the streets of Jeruslaem during those historical two days. The play is held outdoors and has so far been held four times in the streets of [[Rabat]], once at Ħaġar Qim temples and four times (2013-2016) for charity on the grounds surrounding Mount Carmel Hospital. As from 2017 the event will be held at the presidential Verdala palace in aid of the Malta Community Chest Fund. [http://www.ilmixja.com Official Website]

===The Netherlands===
*''De Passiespelen'' is a re-enactment of the Passion of the Christ taking place every year that is divisible by 5, e.g., in 2005 and 2010. It is performed in the open air in [[Openluchttheater De Doolhof]], in [[Tegelen]]. It originated in 1931 and has become an internationally acclaimed event drawing visitors from all over the world.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
*Since 2011, [[Nederland 3]] has broadcast ''[[The Passion (Netherlands)|The Passion]]'', a live television [[Musical theatre|musical]] that features a rendition of the story set in the present day, accompanied by [[popular music]]. Serving as a Dutch adaptation of [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]]'s  special, ''[[Manchester Passion]]'' (2006), it has since been held annually in different cities, with the 2015 edition seen by approximately 3.57 million viewers.

===Philippines===
[[File:Jesus Christ Pagtaltal 2010.jpg|thumb|Actor portraying Jesus on the cross during the ''Pagtaltal'' in Barotac Viejo, [[Iloilo]], Philippines, April 2010.]]The predominantly [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines|Catholic]] [[Philippines]] has Passion Plays called ''Senákulo'', named after the [[Cenacle|Upper room]], every ''[[Holy Week in the Philippines|Semana Santa]]'' (Holy Week). Theatre companies and community groups perform different versions of the ''Senákulo'', using their own scripts that present the dialogue in either poetic or prosaic form. These scripts are decades or even centuries-old, and draw from both the Bible and folk tradition.

Costumes and scenery in traditional Senákulo conform to Hispanic iconography instead of actual [[historical realism]], which is more common with recent productions (particularly by professional companies). Some productions use ropes to hold actors on crosses while others use actual nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In pictures: Philippines crucifixions|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1901095.stm | work=BBC News | date=29 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
Tradition of Passion Plays in [[Poland]] has become popular again in the early 20th century. Today the best known plays take place in Kałków, Kalwaria Pacławska, the [[Pallotines]]' Seminary in Ołtarzew, and the most prominent in [[Sanctuary]] of [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]]. This Passion Play is one of the oldest.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} 
*Since 1998, there has been a yearly Passion Play in Poznan, performed on [[Palm Sunday]] in open air of Cytadela City Park. Now it is the biggest performance of this kind in Europe. In 2009, 100,000 pilgrims were expected to attend.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Slovenia===
In the 17th and 18th century, Passion Plays were organised in the towns of the [[Slovene Lands]], like [[Kranj]], [[Ljubljana]], and [[Novo Mesto]].

The earliest Passion Plays in [[Sri Lanka]], at Vanny in Mannar, Pesalai, Pamanugama, Mutuwal, Pallansena, Kalamulla, Duwa and Pitipana in Negombo, used life-size statues instead of living actors. Influenced by the Oberammergau Passion Play, K. Lawrence Perera, began the practice of using living actors in the Borelassa Passion Play. Women later began to take part in the play. However, for a period of time after 1939, the Archbishop of Colombo banned performances because of his disapproval of the women's participation.&lt;ref&gt;Rohan, Wijith (26 April 2012).

;Origin and history of the Passion Play in the United Kingdom

Passion Plays are biblical dramas that portray the Easter story. They depict the events of Jesus Christ’s trial, death and resurrection and may also extend to the events of his life, works and miracles. Today they are performed at Easter and often take place in public spaces such as city centres and town squares as free, community-led performances.

Popular biblical dramas of the Middle Ages - including liturgical drama, Passion Plays and the Corpus Christi cycles or Mystery Play - are the originators of modern Passion Plays. The Mystery Plays were epic play cycles were large-scale productions financed and produced by medieval guilds for the glory of God and the honour of their city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King|first1=Pamela|title=The York Mystery Cycle and the Worship of the City|date=2006|publisher=D.S.Brewer|location=Suffolk, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most well-known took place in York, Coventry and Chester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogerson|first1=Margaret|title=The York Mystery Plays: Performance in the City|date=2011|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|location=Rochester}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This dramatic heritage is acknowledged by modern Passion Plays. The similarities between these community-led, Bible focussed plays from the Middle Ages and contemporary Mystery Plays and Passion Plays are recognised by artists involved in the plays, journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wainwright|first1=Martin|title=The joy of being part of a Passion play – and a national revival|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2014/apr/12/joy-passion-play-national-revival|date=April 12, 2014|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and academic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rogerson|first1=Margaret|title=Playing a Part in History: The York Mysteries, 1951-2006|date=2009|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Normington|first1=Katie|title=Playing a Part in History: The York Mysteries, 1951-2006|date=2007|location=Woodridge, Suffolk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Passion Trust is a registered charity which supports, resources and researches Passion Plays in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Twiston-Davis|first1=Bess|title=Raw, lyrical, relevant: a one-man Passion play to reckon with|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/faith/article4061143.ece|accessdate=20 August 2014|publisher=The Times|date=April 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashworth|first1=Pat|title=Passion plays ‘stop people in their tracks'|url=http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2014/24-january/news/uk/passion-plays-%E2%80%98stop-people-in-their-tracks%E2%80%99|accessdate=20 August 2014|work=Church Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Oklahoma
*One of the U.S.'s longest running Passion Plays is held at the Holy City of the Wichitas, located within the [[Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge]] in Oklahoma. The Holy City started as an Easter Passion Play in the [[Wichita Mountains]] in 1926. The impetus behind both the pageant and city was the Reverend Anthony Mark Wallock (b. 1890, in Austria). In 1926, he took his Sunday school class up a mountain, where a tableau of the Resurrection was presented. The popularity of this service led its becoming an annual event. In 1927, the service became nonsectarian and was referred to by the Lawton Constitution as ''Oklahoma's Oberammergau.''{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Mexico===
In the town of Iztapalapa the do a passion play in every Easter and is according to the [[Via Crucis]]

==The Passion Play in motion pictures==
* 2004's ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (produced and directed by [[Mel Gibson]]) had a plot similar to that of Passion plays.
* 1989's ''[[Jesus of Montreal]] (Jésus de Montréal)'' (directed by [[Denys Arcand]]) presented the staging of a very unorthodox Passion Play while the players' own lives mirrored the Passion.

==Antisemitism in Passion plays==
Many Passion Plays historically blamed the Jews for [[deicide|the death of Jesus]] in a [[polemic]]al fashion, depicting a crowd of Jewish people condemning Jesus to [[crucifixion]] and a Jewish leader assuming eternal [[collective guilt]] for the crowd for the murder of Jesus, which, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' explains, "for centuries prompted vicious attacks – or [[pogrom]]s – on Europe's Jewish communities".&lt;ref name=Sennott&gt;Sennott, Charles M. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2004/04/10/in_poland_new_passion_plays_on_old_hatreds/ "In Poland, new 'Passion' plays on old hatreds"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', 10 April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine in its article, ''The Problem With Passion'', explains that "such passages (are) highly subject to interpretation".&lt;ref name=Biema&gt;Van Biema, David. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030901-477956,00.html "The Problem With Passion"], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', 25 August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although modern scholars interpret the "blood on our children" ({{bibleref|Matthew|27:25}}) as "a specific group's oath of responsibility"{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} some audiences have historically interpreted it as "an assumption of eternal, racial guilt". This last interpretation has often incited violence against Jews; according to the [[Anti-Defamation League]], "Passion plays historically unleashed the torrents of hatred aimed at the Jews, who always were depicted as being in partnership with the devil and the reason for Jesus' death".&lt;ref name=Foxman&gt;[[Abraham Foxman|Foxman, Abraham H.]] [http://www.adl.org/ADL_Opinions/Interfaith/oped_2004012_pbp.htm "'Passion' Relies on Theme of antisemitism"], ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', 25 January 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', in its article, ''Capturing the Passion'', explains that "historically, productions have reflected negative images of Jews and the long-time church teaching that the Jewish people were [[collective guilt|collectively responsible]] for Jesus' death. Violence against Jews as 'Christ-killers' often flared in their wake."&lt;ref name=Lampman&gt;Lampman, Jane. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0710/p11s01-lire.html?entryBottomStory "Capturing the Passion"], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'', 10 July 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Christianity Today]]'' in ''Why some Jews fear The Passion (of the Christ)'' observed that "Outbreaks of Christian antisemitism related to the Passion narrative have been...numerous and destructive."&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;Hansen, Colin. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/newsletter/2004/feb20.html "Why some Jews fear ''The Passion''"], ''[[Christianity Today]]'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Religion Newswriters Association]] observed that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"in Easter 2001, three incidents made national headlines and renewed their fears. One was a column by [[Paul Weyrich]], a conservative Christian leader and head of the Free Congress Foundation, who argued that "Christ was crucified by the Jews." Another was sparked by comments from the NBA point guard and born-again Christian [[Charlie Ward]], who said in an interview that Jews were persecuting Christians and that Jews "had his [Jesus'] blood on their hands." Finally, the evangelical Christian comic strip artist [[Johnny Hart]] published a B.C. strip that showed a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] disintegrating until it became a cross, with each panel featuring the last words of Jesus, including "[[Sayings of Jesus on the cross#Father forgive them2C for they know not what they do|Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do]]".&lt;ref name=religionlink&gt;[http://www.religionlink.org/tip_040120a.php "'Passion' plays out locally"] February 17, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 16 November 1998, Church Council of [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] similarly adopted a resolution prepared by its Consultative Panel on Lutheran-Jewish Relations urging any Lutheran church presenting a Passion Play to adhere to their ''Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations'', stating that "the New Testament . . . must not be used as justification for hostility towards present-day Jews," and that "blame for the death of Jesus should not be attributed to Judaism or the Jewish people."&lt;ref&gt;Evangelical Lutheran Church in America [http://www.elca.org/Who-We-Are/Our-Three-Expressions/Churchwide-Organization/Ecumenical-and-Inter-Religious-Relations/Inter-Religious-Relations/Christian-Jewish-Relations/Guidelines.aspx "Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations"] 16 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Council of Churches [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd33-23.html "Guidelines for Lutheran-Jewish Relations"] in [http://www.wcc-coe.org/wcc/what/interreligious/cd33-01.html Current Dialogue, Issue 33] July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 and 2004 some people compared [[Mel Gibson]]'s recent film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' to these kinds of Passion Plays, but this characterization is hotly disputed; an analysis of that topic is in the article on [[The Passion of the Christ]]. Despite such fears, there have been no publicized antisemitic incidents directly attributable to the movie's influence.

==Supporters of Passion Plays==
===Passion Trust===

===Europassion===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Europassion Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Europassion Logo 2014]] --&gt;

Europassion is a large European organisation which supports Passion Plays in Europe. Established in 1982, this umbrella organisation draws together Passion Play communities from countries all over Europe, some of which have been performing their plays for hundreds of years.  According to Mons. Fausto Panfili, the Chaplain of the Europassion:

''The experience of the Europassion constantly lets us experience a so far unexplored pathway, so that we can continue to grow. Surmounting a self-referred vision of our own experience obligates us to confront a regional, national, European and universal horizon. That is why a new vision, not fragmentary, is necessary. Unity doesn’t mean uniformity. A spiritual energy, stronger and more attentive to cultural elaboration, a more evident solidarity in order to be recognised as bearers of hope, to help the people and communities grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europassion|url=http://www.europassion.net/en/salutaion/|website=Europassion|accessdate=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Foreman''' (born June 10, 1937 in [[New York City]]) is an American playwright and [[avant-garde]] theater pioneer. He is the founder of the '''Ontological-Hysteric Theater'''.&lt;ref name="Ontololgical-Bio"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Foreman|url=http://www.ontological.com/RF/index.html|title=Richard Foreman Biography|accessdate=November 5, 2009|work=Ontological-Hysteric Theater Web Site|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015114320/http://www.ontological.com/RF/index.html|archivedate=October 15, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career ==
Richard Foreman graduated from [[Brown University]] (B.A. 1959), and received an MFA in Playwriting from [[Yale School of Drama]] in 1962.&lt;ref name="Ontololgical-Bio"/&gt; As an undergraduate, he was instrumental in the formation of [[Production Workshop]], Brown University's student theatre group, while taking part in other student theatre, including set-designing [[Brownbrokers]]' 1958 production of ''Down to Earth''.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Shaffer. [http://dl.lib.brown.edu/pebr/pebr_render.php?issue=1268770665893083&amp;div=DIVL160&amp;pid=0 "'Down to Earth' Offers Gaiety and Diversity"], ''Pembroke Record'' [Providence, RI] 18 April 1958: 4. Web. 2 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Brown presented him with an honorary doctorate.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Rabkin, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=_R33Sv2xAYzKNemgtLEF&amp;id=fBNaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22honorary+doctorate%22+%22Richard+Foreman%22&amp;q=%22honorary+doctorate%22#search_anchor ''Richard Foreman''], Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999, p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he founded the Ontological-Hysteric Theater, which began as an art-oriented project in the New York district of Soho, and later moved to a semi-permanent "home" at Joseph Papp's Public Theater. From 1992 to 2010, the non-profit organization was in residence at the theater at [[St. Mark's Church in-the-Bowery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontological.com/news.html "Ontological-Hysteric Theater leaves St. Mark's Church"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717044000/http://www.ontological.com/news.html |date=2012-07-17 }} Ontological-Hysteric Theater website.

Foreman's dramatic works are driven by the notion of a constant reawakening of the audience; he is one of the major artists creating substantial works in the avant garde performance movement, now largely referred to as post-dramatic theater. Instead of focusing on conflict to shape his theatrical structure, Foreman's work draws on design, text and the live performance of actors equally, to create a different focus and relationship between the stage and audience.  He describes his works as "total theater". The goal of his performances is a "disorientation massage", in contrast to [[Aristotle]]'s goal of [[catharsis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Foreman|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/dram.1998.42.2.157?journalCode=dram|title=Program Notes on Pearls for Pigs|work=TDR, Vol. 42, No. 2 (Summer, 1998)}}, pp. 157-159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreman was influenced by the work of filmmaker/performer [[Jack Smith (film director)|Jack Smith]] and musician [[La Monte Young]] and their approach to time.&lt;ref name="hiltonals"&gt;{{Citation

Richard Foreman has written, directed and designed over fifty of his own plays both in New York City and abroad.  He has received three [[Obie Award]]s for Best Play of the Year, and he has received four other Obies for directing and for "sustained achievement".&lt;ref name="Obies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/obies/search|title=The Village Voice Obies Database|accessdate=November 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has received the annual Literature Award from the [[American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters]], a "Lifetime Achievement in the Theater" award from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[PEN American Center]] Master American Dramatist Award, a [[MacArthur Fellowship]], and in 2004 was elected an officer of the [[Order of Arts and Letters]] of France.  His archives and work materials have been acquired by the [[Fales Library]] at [[New York University]] (NYU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Barbara|last=Jester|url=http://www.nyu.edu/nyutoday/article/990|title=Fales Collection Acquires Papers of Acclaimed Experimental Playwright and Director Richard Foreman|accessdate=November 8, 2009|work=NYU Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fales"&gt;{{cite web|first=Richard|last=Foreman|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/rforeman.html|title=Guide to the Richard Foreman Papers 1942-2004|accessdate=November 7, 2009|work=The Fales Library &amp; Special Collections|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407001441/http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/fales/rforeman.html|archivedate=April 7, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work has been primarily produced by and performed at the Ontological-Hysteric Theater in New York, though he has gained acclaim as director for such productions as [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at Lincoln Center and the premiere of [[Suzan-Lori Parks]]'s ''Venus'' at the [[Public Theater]].

In 2004, Foreman established the [[Bridge Project]] with [[Sophie Haviland]] to promote international art exchange between countries around the world through workshops, symposiums, theater productions, visual art, performance and multimedia events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgefilm.com/Site/ABOUT.html |title=About The Bridge |accessdate=November 8, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002180112/http://www.bridgefilm.com/Site/ABOUT.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2006 to 2008, Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric productions have incorporated the projection of video footage generated through Bridge workshops as a kind of "film-score" that the live performance is conducted in a relation to. These include ''Zomboid!'' (2006), ''Wake Up Mr. Sleepy! Your Unconscious Mind Is Dead!'' (2007) and ''Deep Trance Behavior in Potatoland'' (2008).

Foreman's plays have been co-produced by [[New York Shakespeare Festival|The New York Shakespeare Festival]], [[La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club|La Mama Theatre]], [[The Wooster Group]], the Festival d'Autumn in Paris and the [[Vienna Festival]]. He has collaborated (as librettist and stage director) with composer [[Stanley Silverman]] on 8 music theater pieces produced by The Music Theater Group &amp; [[New York City Opera|The New York City Opera]].  He wrote and directed the feature film ''Strong Medicine''.  He has also directed and designed many classical productions with major theaters around the world including, ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', ''[[The Golem (Leivick)|The Golem]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/08/17/theater/theater-golem-at-the-delacorte.html |title=Theater: 'Golem,' At the Delacorte |last=Gussow |first=Mel |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 17, 1984 |accessdate=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and plays by [[Václav Havel]], [[Botho Strauss]], and [[Suzan-Lori Parks]] for [[New York Shakespeare Festival|The New York Shakespeare Festival]], ''[[Die Fledermaus]]'' at the [[Palais Garnier|Paris Opera]], ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' at the Opera de Lille, [[Philip Glass]]'s ''Fall of the House of Usher'' at the [[American Repertory Theater]] and The Maggio Musicale in [[Florence]], ''[[Woyzeck]]'' at Hartford Stage Company, [[Molière|Molière's]] ''[[Don Juan]]'' at the [[Guthrie Theater]] and [[New York Shakespeare Festival|The New York Shakespeare Festival]], [[Kathy Acker]]'s ''[[Birth of the Poet]]'' at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] and the RO theater in Rotterdam, [[Gertrude Stein]]'s ''[[Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights]]'' at the Autumn Festivals in Berlin and Paris.

Seven collections of his plays have been published, and books studying his work have been published in English, French, and German.

==Ontological-Hysteric Theater==

The '''Ontological-Hysteric Theater''' (OHT) was founded by Foreman in 1968, with the aim of

&lt;blockquote&gt;Stripping the theater bare of everything but the singular and essential impulse to stage the static tension of interpersonal relations in space.  The OHT seeks to produce works that balance a primitive and [[Minimalism|minimal]] style with extremely complex and theatrical themes. ... Foreman’s trademark "total theater" unites elements of the performative, auditory and visual arts, [[philosophy]], [[psychoanalysis]] and literature for a unique result. ...  He seeks to make work that unsettles and disorients received ideas and opens the doors for alternative models of perception, organization, and understanding.  Of course as times, technologies and experiences change, strategies must shift as well.  In 2005 Foreman began a second chapter in his work with the introduction of the digital video and film media as dominating forces in his redefinition of [[Ontology|ontologically]] hysteric theater."&lt;ref name=info&gt;[http://www.ontological.com/INFO/index.html "Info"] on the OHT website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Side projects===
Since taking up its home at the [[Incubator Arts Project|Ontological Theater]] at St. Mark's in 1992, the OHT has also been nurturing a new generation of artists who share Foreman's goals and passion for theater. Through internship, staffing, summer residency and curation efforts, the OHT has been a starting point for many artists making their mark in New York City and internationally including David Herskovits, Artistic Director of Target Margin Theater, Damon Keily, Artistic Director of American Theater in Chicago, some of the artists of Collapsable Giraffe, Radiohole, [[Elevator Repair Service]], [[National Theater of the United States of America]], [[Doorika]], Richard Maxwell, [[Juliana Francis]], Sophie Haviland, Robert Cucuzza, DJ Mendel, Ken Nintzel, Marie Losier, and Young Jean Lee.

In 2005, the OHT chose to formalize its relationship with emerging artists by starting the [[Incubator Arts Project|Ontological-Hysteric Incubator]].  The Incubator is programming that guides artists from workshop phases to fully realized productions. The Incubator houses artists, who follow in the compositional theater footsteps of Foreman, but have their own unique visions and strategies for unsettling perception and disorienting understanding.  The Incubator programming provides these younger artists with aesthetic and practical mentorship and support on their way towards self-sustaining productions.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Mikoyan was born to Ashkhen and [[Anastas Mikoyan]] in [[Moscow]] on June 5, 1929. He joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1953. In 1952, he graduated from the [[Moscow State Institute of International Relations]]. Mikoyan continued to live in Moscow until 1955. During the height of the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] in October 1962, Mikoyan accompanied his father Anastas Mikoyan, as his executive secretary, to [[Cuba]] in high level negotiations with [[Fidel Castro]] and documented much of his father's private reminisces about the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Louis Horowitz|Horowitz, Irving L.]] ''Cuban Communism''. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers, 1995 p. 109 {{ISBN|0-88738-794-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1970 onwards, he was the chief editor of the leading Soviet [[Magazine|journal]] on Latin American affairs, ''Latinskaya Amerika'', a Russian-language monthly.&lt;ref name ="Cuba1"/&gt;

===Scholarly life===
Beginning in the late 1980s, Mikoyan was a participant in several joint Soviet/Russian-American international conferences on the crisis including the [[Harvard University]] sponsored conference at [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in October 1987, the Moscow conference in 1989, the [[Antigua]] conference in 1991 and the [[Havana]] conference in January 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Garthoff, Raymond L. ''A Journey Through the Cold War: A Memoir of Containment and Coexistence''. Washington D.C.: [[Brookings Institution]] Press, 2001 pp. 184-185 {{ISBN|0-8157-0102-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also participated at the 40th Anniversary Conference of the crisis held from October 10 through October 12, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsa/cuba_mis_cri/index.htm The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962: A Political Perspective After Forty Years]. [[George Washington University]].&lt;/ref&gt; Mikoyan later became a chief researcher at the Institute of Peace at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and held a professorship at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name="RFE"&gt;"[http://www.rferl.org/content/WellKnown_Russian_Historian_Sergo_Mikoyan_Dies/1978048.html Well-Known Russian Historian Sergo Mikoyan Dies]." ''[[RFE/RL]]''. March 8, 2010. Retrieved March 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ever since the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, Mikoyan's research and the possession of his father's unpublished memoirs have proved as important sources to American historians who specialize on the recent issues, namely the Cuban Missile Crisis, that have dominated the foreign affairs of the United States and the Soviet Union towards the countries of Latin America since the mid-1950s. While the focus of his studies also included [[Asia]], Mikoyan's work was largely concentrated on the [[leftist]] [[revolutionary movement]]s in the region, most notably [[Cuba]], and its leaders such as [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref name ="SAE"/&gt;

Among the American historians and journalists Mikoyan has collaborated with are [[William Taubman]], [[Jon Lee Anderson]], [[Georgie Anne Geyer]] and [[Irving Louis Horowitz]].

Mikoyan died of [[leukemia]] in a Moscow clinic on March 7, 2010.&lt;ref name="RFE"/&gt;

The '''Society of Antiquaries of Scotland''' is the senior [[antiquarian]] body of [[Scotland]], with its headquarters in the [[National Museum of Scotland]], Chambers Street, [[Edinburgh]]. The Society's aim is to promote the cultural heritage of Scotland.

The usual style of [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominal letters]] for fellows is '''FSA Scot'''.

==History==
[[File:JohnStuartBute.jpg|thumb|[[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]], the former [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|prime minister]], was elected the first President of the Society in 1780.]]
The Society is the oldest antiquarian society in Scotland, and the second-oldest in Britain after the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]].  Founded by [[David Steuart Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan]] on 18 December 1780, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute]], the former [[Prime Minister of Great Britain|prime minister]], was elected the first President.  It was incorporated by [[Royal Charter]] in 1783, in the same year as the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], and in their early years both societies shared accommodation on [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] and in the [[Royal Scottish Academy Building|Royal Institution]] building on [[The Mound]]. Members of the Society collected artefacts of interest to Scottish history and culture from its foundation, and soon the Society developed a sizeable collection.  In November 1851 the signing of a Deed of Conveyance with the Board of Manufactures on behalf of Parliament made the Society collections National Property. In 1891 the antiquaries moved into the purpose-built [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]] and [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]], located on Queen Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socantscot.org/content.asp?Page=472&amp;Menu=|title=Accommodation|accessdate=2010-04-26|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|work=|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612184554/http://www.socantscot.org/content.asp?Page=472&amp;Menu=|archive-date=12 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland Act 1954 transferred the powers and duties relating to the Museum, previously vested in the Society of Antiquaries and the National Galleries, to a new Board.

[[Alexander Rhind]] left a bequest to the Society to fund a lecture series, the [[Rhind Lectures]] are still hosted by the Society; an online recording of these prestigious lectures has been made available to the public since 2009.&lt;ref name="SAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socantscot.org/articles.asp?pubid=87|title=The Rhind Lectures|work=Society's Website|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|accessdate=27 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206135533/http://www.socantscot.org/articles.asp?pubid=87|archivedate=6 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objects==
The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland is a charitable organisation whose purpose is set out in its Royal Charter from 1783: 

{{quote|"…a Society to investigate both antiquities and natural and civil history in general, with the intention that the talents of mankind should be cultivated and that the study of natural and useful sciences should be promoted.”}} 

The first Law of the Society focuses this further:
{{quote|"The purpose of the Society shall be the study of the Antiquities and History of Scotland, more especially by means of Archaeological Research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socantscot.org/content.asp?Page=293&amp;Menu=|title=Laws of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|accessdate=2010-04-26|last=|first=|coauthors=|date=|work=|publisher=Society of Antiquaries of Scotland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325105112/http://www.socantscot.org/content.asp?Page=293&amp;Menu=|archive-date=25 March 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Society today is concerned with every aspect of the human past in Scotland. It draws on a wide range of experience through the [[Fellow]]ship, and provides a voice for Scotland's heritage independent of the opinions of Government, University, or Agency. The Society is consulted by a wide range of organisations from central government to academic funding bodies such as the [[Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council]]. The Society makes written responses to numerous consultations, some jointly with [[Archaeology Scotland]] (formerly CSA) and the Scottish Group of the [[Chartered Institute for Archaeologists]]. The Society worked closely with the Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland (HEACS was abolished by the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 as part of the Scottish Government's policy to simplify the landscape of public bodies), and gave evidence to their working groups on heritage protection legislation and properties in care. The Society has also been actively involved in the [[Built Environment Forum Scotland]], an umbrella body for NGOs in the built and historic environment sectors.

==Fellowship==
Members of the Society have, since 1823, been known as [[Fellow]]s of the Society. There are now thousands of Fellows spread across the globe, including [[Honorary Fellow]]s elected for their outstanding scholarship. Fellowship recognises a persons support and contributions to the purpose and mission of the Society, and Fellows are permitted to use the [[Post-nominal letters|post-nominal]]s '''''FSA Scot''''' (NB Not FSA (Scot) or similar). The Society has an international membership of around 3000 Fellows and a maximum of 25 Honorary Fellows. Admission to the Society is by [[election]], and candidates must be supported by existing Fellows. The names of those seeking admission are then circulated to the whole Fellowship. Elections are held annually at the Anniversary Meeting (AGM) on [[St Andrew's Day]], 30 November. Fundamental to being a candidate for election to the Fellowship is an interest or involvement in Scotland's past. Candidates are advised of the outcome of the election shortly after the ballot.

==Supporting research==
&lt;!-- [[File:OrkneyOgham.jpg|thumb|The [[Buckquoy spindle-whorl]]; photograph taken from [[Katherine Forsyth]], "The ogham-inscribed spindle-whorl from Buckquoy: evidence for the Irish language in pre-Viking Orkney?", in ''The  Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland'', 125, (1995), pp. 677-96, illus 2.]] --&gt;
A major part of the Society's programme is support for research into Scotland's past, and there are various grants and awards to assist different kinds of work, from survey and excavation to finds analysis and archival research.

==Other prizes and awards==
The Society also encourages best practice and continued research into Scotland's past through various prizes and awards.

*[http://www.socantscot.org/grant-prize/rbk-stevenson-award/ The RBK Stevenson Award] - This award of £50 is offered annually in recognition of the article published in the Proceedings on a topic that best reflects the scholarship and high standards of this distinguished individual, who was for many years the Keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland and was President of the Society between 1975 and 1978.
*[http://www.socantscot.org/grant-prize/dorothy-marshall-medal/ The Dorothy Marshall Medal] - Awarded every three years by the Council of the Society for an outstanding contribution, in a voluntary capacity, to Scottish archaeological or related work.
*[http://www.socantscot.org/grant-prize/murray-medal-for-history/ The Murray Medal for History] - Awarded biennially to recognise original research published by the Society into the history of Scotland in the medieval and/or early modern periods (c AD 500 to AD 1700)

==Lectures and events==
The Society hosts monthly lectures, usually between October and May, and generally held in both Edinburgh and Aberdeen, although some are jointly hosted with other Societies elsewhere in Scotland.  The Society can also fund other Societies to invite a lecturer to them; this lecture is called the Buchan Lecture.

In addition, the Society hosts the prestigious [[Rhind Lectures]], a series of six lectures, often presented by a single lecturer over a weekend.  These allow the lecturer to present their topic in much greater detail and depth than otherwise possible, and are often published.  The Rhind lectures began in 1874 after the death of Alexander Rhind who left the residue of his estate to endow a lectureship in the Society and there have now been over 130 lectures and many have become the published textbook for a generation.

*Society lectures and other events are now recorded where possible and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110722060001/http://www.socantscot.org/articles.asp?pubid=92 placed online] on the Society website free to view.
*The [[Rhind Lectures]] are similarly recorded and [https://web.archive.org/web/20101206135533/http://www.socantscot.org/articles.asp?pubid=87 available to view] since 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1111">In [[Archaeology]], '''spoil''' is the term used for the soil, dirt and rubble that results from an [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavation]], and discarded off site on spoil heaps. These heaps are commonly accessed by [[barrow run]]s.

==Spoil management==

Effective management of spoil is necessary because its volume is in general three times that which it was before excavation. Best practice involves removing the spoil away from the excavation site by mechanical earth moving equipment, or the creation of barrow run fed spoil heaps. In the barrow run method, a ramp is built using spoil transported in barrows along the barrow runs. The spoil heap is progressively enlarged by tipping off the vertical end face of the barrow-run. This method is efficient in storing the maximum amount of spoil in the minimum area, where there is no mechanised means of removing spoil a long distance from the site.

Born in [[Ehime Prefecture]], Yanaihara became a [[Christian]] under the influence of [[Uchimura Kanzō]]'s [[Mukyokai]] or [[Nonchurch Movement]], while he was studying at the [[University of Tokyo]]. In the 1930s he was appointed to the chair of [[Colonialism|colonial]] studies at the University of Tokyo, formerly held by his teacher [[Nitobe Inazō]]. However, Yanaihara's [[pacifism|pacifist]] views and emphasis on [[indigenous peoples of Asia|indigenous]] [[self-determination]], which he partly inherited from  Nitobe &amp;ndash;  a [[Quaker]] and founding member of the [[League of Nations]] &amp;ndash; came into a full conflict with Japan's wartime government during [[World War II]]. He was noted for his criticism of Japan's expansionist policies. As a result, Yanaihara was forced to resign from teaching under pressure by right-wing scholars in 1937. Yanaihara resumed his teaching after the war and taught international [[economics]] at the University of Tokyo. He served as the president of the University from 1951 to 1957.

The '''Victoria Tunnel''' is a subterranean [[wagonway]] that runs under [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]], from the Town Moor down to the [[River Tyne]]. It was built between 1839 and 1842 to transport [[coal]] from Leazes Main Colliery in [[Spital Tongues]] to riverside [[wharf|staithes]] (jetties) ready for loading onto boats for export.

The tunnel was driven through boulder clay and formed by a base course of stone supporting a brick arch. Loaded wagons descended the incline of the tunnel under their own weight, and were rope-hauled back to the [[Coal mining|colliery]] by a stationary engine. The colliery closed in January 1860 and the Tunnel was abandoned until the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]] when it was converted for use as an [[air-raid shelter]].

The tunnel is {{convert|2.4|mi|1}} in length with a maximum depth of {{convert|85|ft|0}} and drops {{convert|222|ft|0}} from entrance to exit. It remains largely intact.

== History ==

=== Victorian wagonway ===
When it opened in 1835, the Leazes Main or [[Spital Tongues]] colliery was one of many [[Coal mining|coal mines]] around Newcastle. The [[Industrial Revolution]] was in full swing: demand for coal was high and the competition was great.

Initially, the [[coal]] was carried on carts from the colliery through the streets of [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] to the river, ready for shipping. This was slow, as the town was largely still in its medieval layout, with narrow cobbled streets ([[Grainger Town]] was still in the early stages of construction) and expensive because of the road taxes. Porter and Latimer, the colliery owners, therefore employed a local engineer, William E. Gilhespie,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/history/newcastle-victoria-tunnel-take-tour-10709154&lt;/ref&gt; to construct an underground [[wagonway]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/how-victoria-tunnel-saved-geordies-12589948&lt;/ref&gt; An overground waggonway following much the same route was mooted, but the Freemen of Newcastle would not give permission for tracks to be laid across the [[Town Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne|Town Moor]]. A more direct route to [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]], about {{convert|2|mi|0|spell=in}} upstream from the mouth of the [[Ouseburn]], was also ruled out, because the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/High_Level_and_Low_Level_bridges_-_Newcastle_-_1861.jpg old Tyne Bridge] prevented ships sailing beyond Newcastle (the [[Swing Bridge, River Tyne|Swing Bridge]] would not be built until 1873). Building a staithe here would involve having to pay the [[keelmen]] to take the coal downstream of the bridge before it could be loaded into the [[Collier (ship)|colliers]], thereby significantly reducing the profit margin on each load of coal shipped.

==== Construction ====
Permission to build the tunnel was granted in 1838 and work started the following year. The tunnel was probably dug in sections. The engineers would have excavated a shaft down to the right level then tunnelled out to link up with the next section. John Cherry was appointed to manage the tunnelling, he was a former Yorkshire Lead Miner who had previously been employed as a miner at the Leazes Main Colliery. Building works were carried out by the firm of Mr David Nixon, a builder of Prudhoe Street, Newcastle upon Tyne.&lt;ref name="lore+legend"&gt;{{cite journal
| journal = The Monthly Chronicle of North-Country Lore and Legend
| volume =
| issue = September 1887
| title = The Spital Tongues Tunnel
| date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 200 workers were employed in the construction of the tunnel and Thomas Fordyce in his ''Local Records'' for 8 January 1842 reported:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The workmen, to the number of two hundred, were regaled with a substantial supper and strong ale, supplied by Mrs. Dixon, the worthy hostess of the Unicorn Inn, Bigg-market, Newcastle. The Albion band attended, and enlivened the joyous occasion with their music.&lt;ref name=Fordyce&gt;{{cite journal

| year = 1867
| title = 8 January 1842
| date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The walls of the tunnel were lined in stone, and a double brick arch supported the roof. It is approximately {{convert|7|ft|5|in|m|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m|abbr=on}} wide. This was just large enough to accommodate the custom-built [[chaldron]] wagons.

==== Transporting the coal ====
Because of the gradual gradient of the tunnel, loaded wagons were able to roll along a standard gauge rail track down to the river. A rope was tied to the last wagon in the train and a stationary steam engine at the top of the tunnel hauled the empty wagons back up to the pithead.

==== Grand opening ====
The Victoria Tunnel was named after the popular, young [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]. It was officially opened by the Mayor of Newcastle on 7 April 1842. A crowd of spectators including the sheriff and important merchants gathered on the quayside and at 1&amp;nbsp;pm cannons were fired as a train of eight wagons appeared out of the tunnel. Four of the wagons contained coal, and the others a “company of ladies and gentlemen and a band of musicians”.&lt;ref name=Richardson&gt;{{cite journal

| authorlink=Moses Aaron Richardson
| journal = The Local Historian's Table Book
| volume = V
| issue = 
| year = 1846 
| title = 1842 April 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pit closure ====
The Victoria Tunnel was a financial success: it reduced the cost of transporting coal from the pit to the river by 88%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.victoriatunnel.info&lt;/ref&gt; The colliery, however was not a success and closed in 1860.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-22646845&lt;/ref&gt;

Having taken two and a half years to build, the tunnel was in use for just eighteen years.

=== Air raid shelter ===
In 1939, Britain prepared for war. People were instructed to practise “[[Air Raid Precautions]]” and protect themselves from bombs dropped by the German [[Luftwaffe]]. In Newcastle, the city engineer developed plans to convert the Victoria Tunnel into a communal [[air-raid shelter|air raid shelter]] for 9,000 people.

==== Converting the tunnel ====
[[File:Entrée Tunnel Victoria Newcastle Tyne 1.jpg|thumb|Entrance, Claremont Road.]]
It cost £37,000 to adapt the tunnel into an air raid shelter.&lt;ref name=Rowe&gt;{{cite journal

| journal = Industrial Archaeology: The Journal of the History of Industry and Technology

| date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was cleaned of coal dust and in some parts [[whitewash]]ed. Several [[concrete]] [[blast wall]]s were added to stop potential bomb debris flying along the tunnel. Electric lighting was fitted and a new concrete floor was laid. Wooden benches and about 500 [[bunk bed]]s were installed along the walls, and [[chemical toilet]]s enclosed in canvas cubicles were built near the entrances.

Seven new entrances were completed, although it was originally planned for 16 to be added&lt;ref&gt;https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/how-victoria-tunnel-saved-geordies-12589948&lt;/ref&gt;: Claremont Road, Hancock Museum, St Thomas’ Churchyard, Ridley Place, Shieldfield Green, Crawhall Road, and Ouse Street. At Ouse Street it was possible to walk straight into the tunnel, but the other access points looked like subway entrances and involved walking down a steep corridor.

==== Sheltering in the tunnel ====
There is no doubt that the tunnel was a dark, damp, and uncomfortable place to shelter. Many people were afraid to use it. Those who did remember sitting with their families and neighbours, exchanging gossip and often singing songs while waiting nervously for the [[wikt:all-clear|all-clear]] from up above.

==== After the war ====
At the end of the war, most of the fittings were removed and all of the entrances except Ouse Street were closed. This entrance had been built on private land in the garden of 14 Ouse Street. Guided tours are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ouseburn Trust|url = https://www.ouseburntrust.org.uk|website = Ouseburn Trust|accessdate = 2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route ==
The Victoria Tunnel originally ran from the site of the [[Spital Tongues]] colliery near Hunters Road. It still exists under Claremont Road, and runs past the [[Hancock Museum]], then close to the [[Newcastle Civic Centre|Civic Centre]] and St Mary's Place. From here it travels under [[Northumbria University|Northumbria University City Campus]], the [[A167(M) motorway|Central Motorway]] and [[Shieldfield]] to St Dominic’s Church on the corner of Crawhall Road and New Bridge Street. It then continues under St Ann's Estate to an entrance on Ouse Street. The section of tunnel that continued from here to the [[River Tyne]] was demolished in 1878.

== Restoration ==
A {{convert|766|yd|0|adj=on}} section of the tunnel in the [[Ouseburn Valley]] is still accessible via a World War II entrance on Ouse Street. A programme of visits was first established by the Ouseburn Partnership in 1998. After a period of closure in 2006, [[Newcastle City Council]] carried out a programme of structural repairs and public safety measures, funded by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and Tyne &amp; Wear Partnership. The Victoria Tunnel Education Project developed a number of resources about the tunnel and organised public tours and school workshops from 2009. From 2010 the Ouseburn Trust has run guided tours.

A sound and light installation, commissioned from artist [http://www.axisweb.org/seCVPG.aspx?ARTISTID=8405 Adinda van 't Klooster], focuses on the themes of war, fear, and nuclear weapons, using the [[List of Rainbow Codes|codenames of British military research projects]] as a backdrop.

The '''Yeşilova incident''' refers to an alleged armed stand off that took place in April 1991 between [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Marines]] and the [[Turkish Armed Forces]] at a refugee camp in [[Yeşilova]] (also seen spelled Yasilova), a small town in [[Turkey]] near the borders of [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]].

==Background==
In March 1991, with the end of hostilities between [[Coalition of the Gulf War|Coalition]] forces and the [[Iraq]]i military, Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] sought to quash the rising [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] insurgents who were [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|rebelling against his regime]]. Saddam managed to put down the rebellions with little effort but continued to persecute the Kurds in northern Iraq. Thousands of Kurdish and [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] civilians were displaced, most of them finding shelter in refugee camps in Turkey. Though coalition forces ultimately chose not to intervene against the crackdown, they did launch a massive humanitarian relief effort to at least help alleviate the plight of the refugees.

==The incident==
According to British journalist [[Robert Fisk]], the only reporter present, in April 1991, a British Marines unit consisting of about thirty men was tasked with distributing relief supplies to 3,000 Kurds and Assyrians in Yeşilova under the watch of the Turkish military, but they found themselves in direct confrontation with the Turks. The Turkish soldiers, instead of cooperating with the British Marines in relief distribution, were charged with stealing blankets, bed linen, flour and food, including sixty boxes of water, intended for the refugees, forcing the Marines to intervene.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Fisk|Fisk, Robert]]. ''[[The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East]]''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005, p. 676. {{ISBN|1-4000-4151-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Marines asked to transport the refugees out of the country, a request that was denied by the local Turkish commander. The Marines were thus forced to pile the supplies back into their helicopters to prevent further pillaging but also faced a possible firefight against the Turkish forces. On April 29, a detachment of diplomatic officials and [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agents attached to the [[United States Embassy]] in [[Ankara]] arrived in Yeşilova to help defuse the situation. They found that various diseases, including cases of acute [[diarrhea]] and [[cholera]], had broken out among the civilians in the camp and that the refugees had been deprived of medical services by the Turkish military.&lt;ref&gt;Fisk.

Fisk filed an article for the newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' on April 30 from [[Diyarbakır]], describing the confrontation between the Royal Marines and the Turkish soldiers. Fisk's report incensed Turkish authorities, who detained him in Diyarbakır.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61279083.html?dids=61279083:61279083&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=May+03%2C+1991&amp;author=WILLIAM+D.+MONTALBANO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=Turks+Arrest+Journalist%2C+Expel+30+British+Marines+From+Camp+Refugees%3A+The+two+incidents+spotlight+growing+friction+with+the+allies+that+are+leading+the+relief+effort.&amp;pqatl=google Turks Arrest Journalist, Expel 30 British Marines From Camp Refugees: The two incidents spotlight growing friction with the allies that are leading the relief effort.]" ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. May 3, 1991. Retrieved September 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey's Foreign Ministry and the army's Chief of Staff, General [[Doğan Güreş]], denounced Fisk's article, claiming it was "planned, programmed propaganda."&lt;ref name="Fisk"/&gt; He was interrogated but eventually released and expelled from Turkey. Fisk speculated that charges were being prepared by the governor of Diyarbakır for "defaming" the Turkish military and later described the interrogation session as "pathetic and frightening."&lt;ref&gt;Fisk, Robert. "[https://www.thestar.com Interrogation by Turks 'pathetic, frightening']." ''[[The Toronto Star]]''. May 5, 1991. Throughout his interrogation, Fisk noted that the policemen held wooden cudgels and repeatedly stated that his report was false: "They desperately wanted it to be a lie, my report about the Turkish soldiers who looted food and bottles of water and blankets from the Kurdish refugees at Yasilova...[Superintendent of the police station Hassan] Luru wanted me to say that it had not happened, that I had defamed the Turkish army."&lt;/ref&gt;

Fisk's fellow journalist at the Independent,Hugh Pope, called him a liar over his "cavalier treatment of facts" in the case, pointing out numerous inaccuracies in Fisk's account. &lt;ref&gt;https://hughpope.com/2011/11/20/i-dont-read-hugh-pope-robert-fisk/&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[John Kifner]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' also covered the story quoting a Royal Marines spokesman, Sgt. N. B. Durant, who described the incident between British and Turkish soldiers as a "[[Mexican standoff]]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/04/world/after-the-war-strains-appear-between-turks-and-aid-troops.html "AFTER THE WAR; Strains Appear Between Turks And Aid Troops]." ''[[New York Times]]'', May 4 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
