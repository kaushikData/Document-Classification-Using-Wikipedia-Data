'''''28: Stories of AIDS in Africa''''' is a 2007 non-fiction book by Canadian author [[Stephanie Nolen]], Africa correspondent for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.

The book profiles 28 Africans who have [[HIV/AIDS]], or have otherwise been affected by it. The number 28 was chosen to reflect the 28 million Africans who had HIV in 2007, according to [[UNAIDS]].  Nolen spent six years traveling through Africa to gather the stories.  The stories range from orphans, a truck driver, a miner, and a grandmother raising her grandchildren alone in poverty, to college educated patients, military members, clergy, and even [[Nelson Mandela]], whose son [[Makgatho Mandela|Makgatho]] died of AIDS.

[[Stephen Lewis]] described the book as "the best book ever written about AIDS, certainly the best I've ever read".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080615025258/http://stephenlewisfoundation.org/grassroots/grassroots_canada.htm Stephen Lewis Foundation We're Reading] (Archived from [http://www.stephenlewisfoundation.org/grassroots/grassroots_canada.htm the original] on April 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anticancer Fund''' (ACF) is a Belgian private not-for-profit foundation that provides evidence-based information for patients about cancers and therapies.

==History==
Officially established in 2013, the foundation  has grown from Reliable Cancer Therapies (RCT), a non-profit organization established in 2009. RCT is still operational today, but the foundation has taken over many of its tasks as well as the goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BELGIAN-BASED PRIVATE FOUNDATION: THE ANTICANCER FUND|url=http://www.reliablecancertherapies.com/belgian-based-private-foundation-anticancer-fund|accessdate=27 February 2016|publisher=Reliable Cancer Therapists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The vision of the ACF is to expand the amount of possible treatment options for cancer. The mission of the Anticancer Fund is to cure all people who suffer from cancer. This is done on two levels: information and research.

===Information===

One of the main activities of the anticancer Fund is providing the public with scientifically accurate information regarding cancer and treatments.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.adjacentgovernment.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Anticancer-Fund-ebook-Feb-2016-web.pdf Anticancer Fund]''&lt;/ref&gt; This includes information on the different types of cancer, treatments (both conventional and non-conventional) and other information related to cancer and therapies. The Anticancer Fund holds a HON-certificate for the information that can be found on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://www.healthonnet.org/HONcode/Dutch/?HONConduct998894
| title = HONConduct - Anticancer Fund
| website = www.healthonnet.org
| access-date = 2016-02-25
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of ACF's activities in the information section focus on exposing false and potentially lethal information. This fits in with the goal of providing evidence-based information concerning cancer and cancer treatments. An example of this is the drug [[GcMAF]], which has been promoted as a miracle cure for several illnesses including cancer, but for which those results were never confirmed by independent study.

Dr Pan Pantziarka is the organisation's spokesman in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=70p antimalarial drug could treat bowel cancer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/wellbeing/health-advice/pill-cancer-tumour-bowel-health-drugs-cheap/|accessdate=8 March 2016|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

In terms of research, the ACF develops promising treatment options for patients, which is done on an international scale. The ACF collaborates with other researchers across the European continent to advance the development of cures. The ACF also funds promising research projects financially. For example, the ACF is partaking in the [[CUSP9]] trials, which focuses on the re-purposing of drugs for the treatment of cancer.  It has formed a partnership called the  Repurposing Drugs in Oncology project with the American [[GlobalCures]] to investigate the use of existing medicines with novel uses. It has identified [[Diclofenac]], a common painkiller, as having significant anti-cancer properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Painkiller tapped to become future cancer-killer|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160111135239.htm|accessdate=8 March 2016|publisher=Science Daily|date=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also investigating the use of [[nitroglycerin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Repurposing nitroglycerin for anti-cancer treatments|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2015-08-repurposing-nitroglycerin-anti-cancer-treatments.html|accessdate=8 March 2016|publisher=Medical Xpress|date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
ACF’s funding comes from a private fund, as well donations from individuals who wish to support the cause of the Anticancer Fund.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">'''Bernard Gilles Penot''' (1519 in [[Guyenne]] – 1617 in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]]) was a French [[Renaissance]] [[alchemy|alchemist]] and a friend of [[Nicolas Barnaud]].

Penot studied in Basel. Penot came under the influence of [[Paracelsus]] through [[Adam von Bodenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;Schmieder, ''Geschichte der Alchemie'', 297.&lt;/ref&gt; He supposedly squandered his entire fortune on his alchemical studies, while searching for the [[Philosopher's Stone]]. In the end, he distanced himself from alchemy, which he had previously defended in writing.&lt;ref&gt;Schmieder, loc. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

Penot occasionally served as doctor in [[Frankenthal (Pfalz)]]. He travelled a great deal and had a wide network of contacts and correspondents in England, Bohemia and Switzerland, and  including Jacob Zwinger and [[Andreas Libavius]]. He died impoverished at the hospital in [[Yverdon-les-Bains]] (Ifferten), where he had been the city doctor from 1596.

The influential three volume [[Theatrum Chemicum]] from 1602, a compendium of early [[alchemy|alchemical]] writings, included the text of entitled: '' Treatise varii, the vera praeparatione et usu Medicamentorum chemicorum (Praefatio, De medicamentis chemicis).'' According to Didier Kahn he was also the publisher of the ''Centum quindecim curationes'' in 1582 which was attributed to [[Paracelsus]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, ''Alchimie et paracelsisme en France à la fin de la Renaissance (1567-1625).''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19066">'''Cellular noise''' is random variability in quantities arising in [[cellular biology]]. For example, cells which are genetically identical, even within the same tissue, are often observed to have different expression levels of proteins, different sizes and structures.&lt;ref name = "kaernrev" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "oshearev" /&gt; These apparently random differences can have important biological and medical consequences.&lt;ref name = "johnstonsig" /&gt;

Cellular noise was originally, and is still often, examined in the context of gene expression levels – either the concentration or copy number of the products of genes within and between cells. As [[gene expression]] levels are responsible for many fundamental properties in cellular biology, including cells' physical appearance, behaviour in response to stimuli, and ability to process information and control internal processes, the presence of noise in gene expression has profound implications for many processes in cellular biology.

== Definitions ==
The most frequent quantitative definition of noise is the [[coefficient of variation]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\eta_X = \frac{\sigma_X}{\mu_X},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\eta_X&lt;/math&gt; is the noise in a quantity &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]] value of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_X&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard deviation]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. This measure is [[dimensionless]], allowing a relative comparison of the importance of noise, without necessitating knowledge of the absolute mean.

Other quantities often used for mathematical convenience are the [[Fano factor]]:

: &lt;math&gt;F_X = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{\mu_X}.&lt;/math&gt;

and the normalized variance:

: &lt;math&gt;N_X = \eta_X^2 = \frac{\sigma_X^2}{\mu_X^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Intrinsic and extrinsic noise ==
[[File:Extrinsic and intrinsic noise in cellular biology.svg|thumb|300px|right|A schematic illustration of a dual reporter study. Each data point corresponds to a measurement of the expression level of two identically-regulated genes in a single cell: the scatter reflects measurements of a population of cells. Extrinsic noise is characterised by expression levels of both genes covarying between cells, intrinsic by internal differences.]]

Cellular noise is often investigated in the framework of ''intrinsic'' and ''extrinsic'' noise. Intrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities within a single cell: for example, the intra-cell variation in expression levels of two identically-controlled genes. Extrinsic noise refers to variation in identically-regulated quantities between different cells: for example, the cell-to-cell variation in expression of a given gene.

Intrinsic and extrinsic noise levels are often compared in '''dual reporter studies''', in which the expression levels of two identically-regulated genes (often fluorescent reporters like [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]] and [[Yellow fluorescent protein|YFP]]) are plotted for each cell in a population.&lt;ref name = "elowitz" /&gt;

== Sources ==
''Note'': These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise sources is an active and expanding area of research.

;Intrinsic noise
* ''Low copy-number effects (including discrete birth and death events)'': the random ([[stochastic]]) nature of production and degradation of cellular components means that noise is high for components at low copy number (as the magnitude of these random fluctuations is not negligible with respect to the copy number);
* ''Diffusive cellular dynamics'':&lt;ref name = "tenwolde" /&gt; many important cellular processes rely on collisions between reactants (for example, RNA polymerase and DNA) and other physical criteria which, given the [[Diffusion|diffusive]] dynamic nature of the cell, occur stochastically.
* ''Noise propagation'': Low copy-number effects and diffusive dynamics result in each of the biochemical reactions in a cell occurring randomly. Stochasticity of reactions can be either attenuated or amplified. Contribution each reaction makes to the intrinsic variability in copy numbers can be quantified via [[system size expansion|Van Kampen's system size expansion]].&lt;ref name = "decomposingnoise" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "stochdecomp" /&gt;
;Extrinsic noise
* ''Cellular age / cell cycle stage'': cells in a dividing population that is not synchronised will, at a given snapshot in time, be at different [[cell cycle]] stages, with corresponding biochemical and physical differences;&lt;ref name = "newman" /&gt;
* ''Physical environment (temperature, pressure, ...)'': physical quantities and chemical concentrations (particularly in the case of cell-to-cell signalling) may vary spatially across a population of cells, provoking extrinsic differences as a function of position;&lt;ref name = "athale" /&gt;
* ''Organelle distributions'': random factors in the quantity and quality of organelles (for example, the number and functionality of [[mitochondria]]&lt;ref name = 'dasneves' /&gt;) lead to significant cell-to-cell differences in a range of processes&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt; (as, for example, mitochondria play a central role in the energy budget of eukaryotic cells);
* ''Inheritance noise'': uneven partitioning of cellular components between daughter cells at [[mitosis]] can result in large extrinsic differences in a dividing population.&lt;ref name = "huh" /&gt;

Note that extrinsic noise can affect levels and types of intrinsic noise:&lt;ref name = "shahrezaei" /&gt; for example, extrinsic differences in the mitochondrial content of cells lead, through differences in [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] levels, to some cells transcribing faster than others, affecting the rates of gene expression and the magnitude of intrinsic noise across the population.&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;

== Effects ==
''Note'': These lists are illustrative, not exhaustive, and identification of noise effects is an active and expanding area of research.

* ''Gene expression levels'': noise in gene expression causes differences in the fundamental properties of cells, limits their ability to biochemically control cellular dynamics,&lt;ref name = "lestas" /&gt; and directly or indirectly induce many of the specific effects below;
* ''Energy levels and transcription rate'': [[Transcriptional noise|noise in transcription rate]], arising from sources including [[transcriptional bursting]], is a significant source of noise in expression levels of genes. Extrinsic noise in [[mitochondria]]l content has been suggested to propagate to differences in the ATP concentrations and transcription rates (with functional relationships implied between these three quantities) in cells, affecting cells' energetic competence and ability to express genes;&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;
* ''Phenotype selection'': bacterial populations exploit extrinsic noise to choose a population subset to enter a quiescent state.&lt;ref name = "fraser" /&gt; In a bacterial infection, for example, this subset will not propagate quickly but will be more robust when the population is threatened by antibiotic treatment: the rapidly replicating, infectious bacteria will be killed more quickly than the quiescent subset, which may be capable of restarting the infection. This phenomenon is why courses of antibiotics should be finished even when symptoms seem to have disappeared;
* ''Development and stem cell differentiation'': [[developmental noise]] in biochemical processes which need to be tightly controlled (for example, patterning of gene expression levels that develop into different body parts) during organismal development can have dramatic consequences, necessitating the evolution of robust cellular machinery. [[Stem cells]] differentiate into different cell types depending on the expression levels of various characteristic genes:&lt;ref name = "enver" /&gt; noise in gene expression can clearly perturb and influence this process, and noise in transcription rate can affect the structure of the dynamic landscape that differentiation occurs on;&lt;ref name = "johnston" /&gt;
* ''Cancer treatments'': recent work has found extrinsic differences, linked to gene expression levels, in the response of cancer cells to anti-cancer treatments, potentially linking the phenomenon of fractional killing (whereby each treatment kills some but not all of a tumour) to noise in gene expression.&lt;ref name = "spencer" /&gt;  Because individual cells could repeatedly and stochastically perform transitions between states associated with differences in responsiveness to a therapeutic modality (chemotherapy, targeted agent, radiation, etc.), therapy might need to be administered frequently (to ensure cells are treated soon after entering a therapy-responsive state, before they can rejoin the therapy-resistant subpopulation and proliferate) and over long times (to treat even those cells emerging late from the final residue of the therapy-resistant subpopulation).&lt;ref name = "liaoconceptualizing" /&gt;
* ''Information processing'': as cellular regulation is performed with components that are themselves subject to noise, the ability of cells to process information and perform control is fundamentally limited by intrinsic noise&lt;ref name = "lestas" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "swaininfo" /&gt;

== Analysis ==
[[File:Modelling stochastic gene expression.svg|thumb|400px|A canonical model for stochastic gene expression, known as the two-state or telegraph &lt;ref name = "pecoud" /&gt; model. DNA flips between "inactive" and "active" states (involving, for example, [[chromatin|chromatin remodelling]] and [[transcription factor]] binding). Active DNA is transcribed to produce mRNA which is translated to produce protein, both of which are degraded. All processes are [[Poisson process|Poissonian]] with given rates.]]

As many quantities of cell biological interest are present in discrete copy number within the cell (single DNAs, dozens of mRNAs, hundreds of proteins), tools from discrete [[Stochastic process|stochastic mathematics]] are often used to analyse and model cellular noise.&lt;ref name = "paulsson" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "wilkinson" /&gt; In particular, [[master equation]] treatments – where the probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; of observing a system in a state &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; are linked through [[Ordinary differential equation|ODEs]] – have proved particularly fruitful. A canonical model for noise gene expression, where the processes of [[Transcription factor|DNA activation]], [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] are all represented as [[Poisson processes]] with given rates, gives a master equation which may be solved exactly (with [[generating functions]]) under various assumptions or approximated with stochastic tools like [[system size expansion|Van Kampen's system size expansion]].

Numerically, the [[Gillespie algorithm]] or stochastic simulation algorithm is often used to create realisations of stochastic cellular processes, from which statistics can be calculated.

The problem of inferring the values of parameters in stochastic models ([[Parametric statistics|parametric inference]]) for biological processes, which are typically characterised by sparse and noisy experimental data, is an active field of research, with methods including [[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Bayesian MCMC]] and [[approximate Bayesian computation]] proving adaptable and robust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sunnåker et al |title=Approximate bayesian computation |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |date=2013 |volume=9 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the two-state model, a moment-based method was described for parameters inference from mRNAs distributions.&lt;ref name = "pecoud" /&gt;

==History==
In 1974, the husband and wife pair of Florence Ludins-Katz and Elias Katz founded Creative Growith in their garage. Ludins-Katz was an artist and Katz was a psychologist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hurwitz |first1=Rebecca |title=Creative Growth Center: An unwavering community in an ever-changing Oakland {{!}} The Daily Californian |url=http://www.dailycal.org/2016/10/23/creative-growth-center-unwavering-community-ever-changing-oakland/ |website=The Daily Californian |date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of Bay Area grassroots [[collectivism]] and the disability-rights movement of the 1970s, the nonprofit Creative Growth Art Center is currently run by the filmmaker and former curator, Tom di Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Buckwalter |first1=Timothy |title=Creative Growth: An interview with Tom di Maria {{!}} KQED Arts |url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/20885/creative_growth_an_interview_with_tom_di_maria |website=www.kqed.org |publisher=KQED |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Creative Growth relocated to a former auto-repair shop near downtown [[Oakland, California]] where it currently operates.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rich |first1=Nathaniel |title=A Training Ground for Untrained Artists |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/20/magazine/a-training-ground-for-untrained-artists.html?mtrref=www.google.com&amp;gwh=93A1C90E395B9004F1CC9CC1B99A72B1&amp;gwt=pay |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Matthew Higgs]], Director/Chief Curator at [[White Columns]], curated a show titled "Everyone!" that featured over 130 works made by Creative Growth artists and included each and every artist currently enrolled in the studio program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Everyone! - Creative Growth Art Center |url=http://www.creativegrowth.org/exhibitions/everyone-2/ |website=Creative Growth Art Center |date=28 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists==
Thousands of artists have come through Creative Growth's doors over the years. A number have reach national recognition. Recently, Creative Growth artists have had major exhibitions at the [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington DC ([[Judith Scott (artist)|Judith Scott]], 2018); [[Venice Biennale]] (Dan Miller and Judith Scott, 2017); [[Brooklyn Museum]] (Judith Scott, 2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brooklyn Museum: Judith Scott—Bound and Unbound |url=https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/judith_scott/ |website=www.brooklynmuseum.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Museum of Modern Art]] (Dan Miller, 2008); and [[White Columns]] ([[William Scott (artist)|William Scott]], 2009, 2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=White Columns - Exhibitions - William Scott – ‘Good Person’ |url=https://www.whitecolumns.org/sections/exhibition.php?id=1181 |website=www.whitecolumns.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Trend - fashion show==
Beyond Trend is Creative Growth's runway extravaganza that started in 2010 as a small in-gallery showing of fashion. The 2018 show, its' largest yet, opened at the 1,250-seat Scottish Rite Center, where it was chaired by [[Paper magazine]] co-founder [[Kim Hastreiter]] and [[Target Corporation|Target]] Chief Creative Officer Todd Waterbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bravo |first1=Tony |title=Creative Growth's special needs clients seize the limelight at fashion show |url=https://www.sfchronicle.com/style/article/Creative-Growth-s-special-needs-clients-seize-12810750.php |website=SFChronicle.com |date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media Attention==
Creative Growth was featured in the October 1990 issue of [[Elle Decor]] in an article tilted "Aimed Straight From The Heart" written by [[Susan Subtle]]. Subtle reviews the organization highly. She compares the style of art made at creative growth to [[Outsider art|Outsider]], [[Primitive art|Primitive]], [[Naive Art|Naive]], Brut, and early-American folk art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Subtle |first1=Susan |title=Aimed Straight From The Heart |journal=Elle Decor |date=October 1990 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2015, the organization was featured in a [[T Magazine]] article titled "A Training Ground For Untrained Artists" written by [[Nathaniel Rich (novelist)|Nathaniel Rich]].&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

In 2018, a segment in the ninth season of Art in the Twenty-First Century, [[Art21]] talks to some of the artists and administrators involved with Creative Growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nwangwa |first1=Shirley |title=‘This Is Who I Am in the World’: Preview Art21’s Report on the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland |url=http://www.artnews.com/2018/07/25/world-preview-art21s-report-creative-growth-art-center-oakland/ |website=ARTnews |date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to founding CrowdMed, CEO Jared Heyman built the internet survey company Infosurv, lead developer Axel Setyano worked at Loku, and lead designer Jessica Greenwalt founded graphic design firm Pixelkeet.&lt;ref name=techcrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Former [[WebMD]] general manager Clare Martorana and [[Second Life]] founder [[Philip Rosedale]] are advisors for the company.&lt;ref name=techcrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

==Operations==
There is a free case submission option, but CrowdMed also offers three paid packages each providing additional benefits.&lt;ref name="crowdmed"&gt;{{cite web|title=Does it cost anything to submit a case on CrowdMed?|url=https://www.crowdmed.com/faqs|website=CrowdMed|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; User information is kept anonymous and their case includes symptoms, health history, family background, and tests that have already been taken.&lt;ref name=readwrite/&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=wjs/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Hundreds of "medical detectives" then submit possible diagnoses which other detectives bet upon to agree with the result. These "medical detectives" can be anyone from medical school students, to retired physicians, to anyone else, as there is no requirement for a medical degree to help solve these illnesses.&lt;ref name="vox"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.vox.com/2015/5/9/8575845/crowdsource-medicine| title=The wisdom of Crowdmed: how one website is trying to solve medical mysteries| author=Belluz, Julia |authorlink=Julia Belluz| date=May 9, 2015| publisher=Vox| accessdate=May 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, the top three diagnoses are given to the patient for them to take to their doctor.&lt;ref name=businessweek/&gt;&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref name=mobi/&gt; The results from each medical detective are weighed based on their prior performance and current rating from patients, additionally medical detectives may also earn and share monetary rewards offered by patients to anyone who helps solve their case.&lt;ref name="healthcare"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://healthcare-economist.com/2014/04/23/crowdmed/| title=CrowdMed| author=Jason Shafrin| date=April 23, 2014| publisher=Healthcare Economist| accessdate=February 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of May 2015, CrowdMed has solved over 900 cases, which take from a few weeks to a month to solve.&lt;ref name="vox"/&gt;

==Foreign population in Luxembourg==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}
[[Image:COB Luxembourg.PNG|right|thumb|300px]]
The foreign population resident in Luxembourg currently numbers over 238,800, corresponding to 44,5% of the total population (compared to 17% in the 1960s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Population par sexe et par nationalité (x 1 000) 1981, 1991, 2001 - 2013|url=http://www.statistiques.public.lu/stat/TableViewer/tableView.aspx?ReportId=384&amp;IF_Language=fra&amp;MainTheme=2&amp;FldrName=1|publisher=Le portail des statistiques|accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These immigrants are overwhelmingly nationals of EU countries (accounting for over 90%), by far the greater part of whom originally come from Portugal, Italy and the two neighbouring countries, France and Belgium. For some years, there has also been a big increase in the number of immigrants and asylum seekers from the countries of Eastern Europe, and especially the new republics to have emerged from the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Montenegro). These immigrants include a considerable proportion of young people. Immigrants (especially asylum seekers) have a strong impact on the birth rate, accounting for nearly 50% of births in Luxembourg.

A more detailed breakdown by nationality shows that the Portuguese community is still the largest group, accounting for more than a third of the foreign population. The Italian population has been stable for the past ten years at approximatively 20,000. Some 47,000 foreigners come from bordering countries (France, Belgium and Germany).

As of 2014 the estimated population of Russian nationals in Luxembourg is 5,000. Luxembourg Russian Saturday school, Kalinka, serves students ages 3–12 and includes Russian language and cultural classes. In 2014, there were 160 students and 22 teachers in the school.&lt;ref name=ExpatriateJapaneseRussian&gt;"[http://www.wort.lu/en/community/how-expatriate-children-stay-in-touch-with-their-cultural-roots-supplementary-schools-in-luxembourg-531d6e1ce4b03e321374f515 How expatriate children stay in touch with their cultural roots - supplementary schools in Luxembourg]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6WLvUB39h Archive]).

It is held at the [[International School Luxembourg]] and as of 2014 has about 60 students. Its operations at the ISL began in 1991.&lt;ref name=ExpatriateJapaneseRussian/&gt;

==Religious affiliation==
The predominant religion of the Luxembourg population is Roman Catholic, with Protestant, Anglican, Jewish and Muslim minorities. According to a 1979 law, the government forbids collection of data on religious practices, but over 90% is estimated to be baptized Catholic (the Virgin Mary is the Patroness of the city of Luxembourg).

The Lutherans are the largest Protestant denomination in the country. Muslims are estimated to number approximately 6000 persons, notably including 1,500 refugees from Montenegro; Orthodox (Albanian, Greek, Serbian, Russian, and Romanian) adherents are estimated to number approximately 5,000 persons, along with approximately 1,000 Jews. Freedom of religion is provided by the Luxembourg Constitution. {{Citation needed|reason=This section needs references to reliable sources|date=May 2014}}

'''Dysgeusia''', also known as '''parageusia''', is a distortion of the sense of taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with [[ageusia]], which is the complete lack of taste, and [[hypogeusia]], which is a decrease in taste sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel K. Feske and Martin A. Samuels, ''Office Practice of Neurology'' 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Elsevier Science, 2003) 114.&lt;/ref&gt; An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary [[symptom]]. The distortion in the sense of taste is the only symptom, and [[diagnosis]] is usually complicated since the sense of taste is tied together with other [[sensory systems]]. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.

==Symptoms==

The alterations in the sense of [[taste]], usually a metallic taste, and sometimes [[Olfaction|smell]] are the only symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=HJ|last2=Ishii|first2=EK|last3=MacTurk|first3=RH|title=Age-related changes in the prevalence of smell/taste problems among the United States adult population. Results of the 1994 disability supplement to the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS)|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=30 November 1998|volume=855|pages=716–22|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb10650.x|pmid=9929676|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1230764|type=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration of the symptoms of dysgeusia depends on the cause. If the alteration in the sense of taste is due to [[gum disease]], [[dental plaque]], a temporary medication, or a short-term condition such as a [[Common cold|cold]], the dysgeusia should disappear once the cause is removed. In some cases, if [[lesions]] are present in the taste pathway and nerves have been damaged, the dysgeusia may be permanent.

==Causes==

===Chemotherapy===

A major cause of dysgeusia is [[chemotherapy]] for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in [[oral mucositis]], oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of [[inflammation]] of the mouth, along with sores and [[mouth ulcer|ulcers]] in the tissues.&lt;ref name=Judith&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raber-Durlacher|first1=Judith E.|last2=Barasch|first2=Andrei|last3=Peterson|first3=Douglas E.|last4=Lalla|first4=Rajesh V.|last5=Schubert|first5=Mark M.|last6=Fibbe|first6=Willem E.|title=Oral Complications and Management Considerations in Patients Treated with High-Dose Chemotherapy|journal=Supportive Cancer Therapy|date=July 2004|volume=1|issue=4|pages=219–229|doi=10.3816/SCT.2004.n.014|pmid=18628146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial [[organisms]] residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-[[pathogenic]] agents to cause serious infection, which may result in a decrease in [[saliva]]. In addition, patients who undergo [[radiation therapy]] also lose salivary tissues.&lt;ref name="pmid16772071"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiseman|first1=Michael|title=The treatment of oral problems in the palliative patient|journal=Journal (Canadian Dental Association)|date=June 2006|volume=72|issue=5|pages=453–8|pmid=16772071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva is an important component of the taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Matsuo R | year = 2000| title = Role of saliva in the maintenance of taste sensitivity | doi = 10.1177/10454411000110020501 | journal = Crit. Rev. Oral Biol. Med. | volume =  11| issue = 2| pages = 216–29| pmid=12002816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively.&lt;ref name=Speilman&gt;{{cite journal | author = Speilman A. L. | year = 1990| title = Interaction of Saliva and Taste | doi = 10.1177/00220345900690030101 | pmid = 2182682| journal = J Dent Res | volume =  69| issue = 3| pages = 838–843}}&lt;/ref&gt; The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva.&lt;ref name=Speilman /&gt; It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have suffered from either dysgeusia or another form of taste impairment.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt; Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are [[cyclophosphamide]], [[cisplatin]], and [[etoposide]].&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt; The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.&lt;ref name=Judith /&gt;

===Taste buds===

Distortions in the [[taste buds]] may give rise to dysgeusia. In a study conducted by Masahide Yasuda and Hitoshi Tomita from Nihon University of Japan, it has been observed that patients suffering from this taste disorder have fewer microvilli than normal. In addition, the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytoplasm]] of the taste bud cells have been reduced. Based on their findings, dygeusia results from loss of [[microvilli]] and the reduction of Type III intracellular vesicles, all of which could potentially interfere with the gustatory pathway.  Radiation to head and neck also results in direct destruction of taste buds, apart from effects of altered salivary output.&lt;ref name=Masahide /&gt;

===Zinc deficiency===

Another primary cause of dysgeusia is [[zinc]] deficiency. While the exact role of zinc in dysgeusia is unknown, it has been cited that zinc is partly responsible for the repair and production of taste buds. Zinc somehow directly or indirectly interacts with [[carbonic anhydrase VI]], influencing the concentration of gustin, which is linked to the production of taste buds.&lt;ref name=Heckman/&gt; It has also been reported that patients treated with zinc experience an elevation in [[calcium]] concentration in the saliva.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; In order to work properly, taste buds rely on calcium receptors.&lt;ref name=Joseph&gt;Joseph M. Bicknell, MD and Robert V. Wiggins, MD, “Taste Disorder From Zinc Deficiency After Tonsillectomy,” ''The Western Journal of Medicine'' Oct.1988: 458.&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc “is an important cofactor for [[alkaline phosphatase]], the most abundant [[enzyme]] in taste bud membranes; it is also a component of a parotid salivary protein important to the development and maintenance of normal taste buds.”&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt;

===Drugs===

There are also a wide variety of drugs that can trigger dysgeusia, including [[zopiclone]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sanofi-Aventis Australia Pty Limited|title=Product Information IMOVANE (zopiclone) Tablets|url=http://www.sanofi.com.au/products/aus_pi_imovane.pdf|accessdate=9 November 2014|location=ADVERSE EFFECTS|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-[[antihistamines]], such as [[azelastine]] and [[emedastine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=F. Estelle R.|title=Advances in H1-Antihistamines|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=18 November 2004|volume=351|issue=21|pages=2203–2217|doi=10.1056/NEJMra033121|pmid=15548781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 250 drugs affect taste.&lt;ref name=Samuel&gt;Samuel K. Feske and Martin A. Samuels, ''Office Practice of Neurology'' 2nd ed. (Philadelphia: Elsevier Science, 2003) 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sodium]] channels linked to taste receptors can be inhibited by [[amiloride]], and the creation of new taste buds and saliva can be impeded by [[antiproliferative]] drugs.&lt;ref name=Samuel /&gt; Saliva can have traces of the drug, giving rise to a metallic flavor in the mouth; examples include [[lithium carbonate]] and [[tetracyclines]].&lt;ref name=Samuel /&gt; Drugs containing [[sulfhydryl]] groups, including [[penicillamine]] and [[captopril]], may react with zinc and cause deficiency.&lt;ref name=Joseph /&gt; [[Metronidazole]] and [[chlorhexidine]] have been found to interact with metal ions that associate with the [[cell membrane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciancio|first1=Sebastian G.|title=Medications' impact on oral health|journal=Journal of the American Dental Association|date=October 2004|volume=135|issue=10|pages=1440–8; quiz 1468–9|pmid=15551986|doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2004.0055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs that prevent the production of [[angiotensin II]] by inhibiting [[angiotensin converting enzyme]], [[eprosartan]] for example, have been linked to dysgeusia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castells|first1=X.|title=Drug points: Dysgeusia and burning mouth syndrome by eprosartan|journal=BMJ|date=30 November 2002|volume=325|issue=7375|pages=1277|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7375.1277|pmid=12458247|pmc=136926}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are few case reports claiming calcium channel blockers like [[Amlodipine]] also cause dysguesia by blocking calcium sensitive taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;Pugazhenthan Thangaraju, Harmanjith Singh, Prince Kumar and Balasubramani Hariharan,"Is Dysguesia going to be a rare or a common side-effect of Amlodipine?,"''Ann Med Health Sci Res,''Mar-Apr 2014: {{PMC|4083725}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous causes===
[[Xerostomia]], also known as dry mouth syndrome, can precipitate dysgeusia because normal salivary flow and concentration are necessary for taste. Injury to the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] can result in dysgeusia. In addition, damage done to the [[pons]], [[thalamus]], and [[midbrain]], all of which compose the gustatory pathway, can be potential factors.&lt;ref name=RK&gt;R. K. Mal and M. A. Birchall, “Dysgeusia related to urinary obstruction from benign prostatic disease: a case control and qualitative study,” ''European Archives of Oto-Rhino Laryngology'' 24 Aug. 2005:178.&lt;/ref&gt; In a case study, 22% of patients who were experiencing a bladder obstruction were also suffering from dysgeusia. Dysgeusia was eliminated in 100% of these patients once the obstruction was removed.&lt;ref name=RK /&gt; Although it is uncertain what the relationship between bladder relief and dysgeusia entails, it has been observed that the areas responsible for [[urinary system]] and taste in the pons and [[cerebral cortex]] in the brain are close in proximity.&lt;ref name=RK /&gt;

Many of the causes for dysgeusia occur due to unknown reasons. A wide range of miscellaneous factors may contribute to this taste disorder, such as [[gastric reflux]], [[lead poisoning]], and [[diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman M. Mann, MD, “Management of Smell and Taste Problems,” ''Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine'' Apr. 2002: 334.&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of [[pine nut]]s can apparently cause taste disturbances, for reasons which are not entirely proven. Certain pesticides can have damaging effects on the taste buds and nerves in the mouth. These [[pesticides]] include [[organochloride]] compounds and [[carbamate]] pesticides. Damage to the [[peripheral nerves]], along with injury to the [[chorda tympani]] branch of the facial nerve, also cause dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; A surgical risk for [[laryngoscopy]] and [[tonsillectomy]] include dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; Patients who suffer from the [[burning mouth syndrome]], most likely [[menopausal]] women, are often suffering from dysgeusia as well.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Lauria, Alessandra Majorana, Monica borgna, Raffaella Lombardi, Paola Penza, Alessandro padovani, and Pierluigi Sapelli, “Trigeminal small-fiber sensory neuropathy causes burning mouth syndrome,” ''Pain'' 11 Mar. 2005: 332, 336.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Normal function===

The sense of taste is based on the detection of chemicals by specialized taste cells in the mouth. The mouth, throat, larynx, and esophagus all have [[taste buds]], which are replaced every ten days. Each taste bud contains receptor cells.&lt;ref name=Norman /&gt; Afferent nerves make contact with the receptor cells at the base of the taste bud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brand|first1=Joseph G|title=Within reach of an end to unnecessary bitterness?|journal=The Lancet|date=October 2000|volume=356|issue=9239|pages=1371–1372|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(00)02836-1|pmid=11052575}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single taste bud is innervated by several afferent nerves, while a single efferent fiber innervates several taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beidler|first1=L. M.|title=Renewal of cells within taste buds|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|date=1 November 1965|volume=27|issue=2|pages=263–272|doi=10.1083/jcb.27.2.263|citeseerx=10.1.1.281.8593}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fungiform papillae]] are present on the anterior portion of the tongue while [[circumvallate papillae]] and [[foliate papillae]] are found on the posterior portion of the tongue. The [[salivary glands]] are responsible for keeping the taste buds moist with saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bromley|first1=SM|title=Smell and taste disorders: a primary care approach|journal=American Family Physician|date=15 January 2000|volume=61|issue=2|pages=427–36, 438|pmid=10670508|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0115/p427.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A single taste bud is composed of four different types of cells, and each taste bud has at least 30 to 80 cells. Type I cells are thinly shaped, usually in the periphery of other cells. They also contain high amounts of [[chromatin]]. Type II cells have prominent [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]] and nucleoli with much less chromatin than Type I cells. Type III cells have multiple [[mitochondria]] and large [[Vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. Type I, II, and III cells also contain [[synapses]]. Type IV cells are normally rooted at the posterior end of the taste bud. Every cell in the taste bud forms [[microvilli]] at the ends.&lt;ref name=Masahide&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yasuda|first1=Masahide|last2=Tomita|first2=Hitoshi|title=Electron Microscopic Observations of Glossal Circumvallate Papillae in Dysgeusic Patients|journal=Acta Oto-Laryngologica|date=8 July 2009|volume=122|issue=4|pages=122–128|doi=10.1080/00016480260046508}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In humans, the sense of taste is conveyed via three of the twelve [[cranial nerves]]. The [[chorda tympani]] is responsible for taste sensations from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, the [[glossopharyngeal nerve]] (IX) is responsible for taste sensations from the posterior one third of the tongue while a branch of the [[vagus nerve]] (X) carries some taste sensations from the back of the [[oral cavity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Diagnosis==
In general, [[gustatory]] disorders are challenging to diagnose and evaluate. Because gustatory functions are tied to the sense of [[Olfaction|smell]], the [[somatosensory system]], and the perception of [[pain]] (such as in tasting spicy foods), it is difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deems|first1=DA|last2=Doty|first2=RL|last3=Settle|first3=RG|last4=Moore-Gillon|first4=V|last5=Shaman|first5=P|last6=Mester|first6=AF|last7=Kimmelman|first7=CP|last8=Brightman|first8=VJ|last9=Snow JB|first9=Jr|title=Smell and taste disorders, a study of 750 patients from the University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center|journal=Archives of Otolaryngology--head &amp; Neck Surgery|date=1 May 1991|volume=117|issue=5|pages=519–28|doi=10.1001/archotol.1991.01870170065015|pmid=2021470}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare when compared to [[olfactory]] disorders.&lt;ref name=Hummel&gt;Hummel T, Knecht M. Smell and taste disorders. In: Calhoun KH, ed. Expert Guide to Otolaryngology. Philadelphia, Pa: American College of Physicians; 2001:650-664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diagnosis of dysgeusia begins with the patient being questioned about [[salivation]], swallowing, chewing, oral pain, previous [[ear infections]] (possibly indicated by hearing or balance problems), [[oral hygiene]], and stomach problems.&lt;ref name=Schiffman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epstein|first1=Franklin H.|last2=Schiffman|first2=Susan S.|title=Taste and Smell in Disease|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=26 May 1983|volume=308|issue=21|pages=1275–1279|doi=10.1056/NEJM198305263082107|pmid=6341841}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial history assessment also considers the possibility of accompanying diseases such as [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypothyroidism]], or [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Schiffman /&gt; A clinical examination is conducted and includes an inspection of the tongue and the oral cavity. Furthermore, the [[ear canal]] is inspected, as lesions of the [[chorda tympani]] have a predilection for this site.&lt;ref name=Schiffman /&gt;

===Gustatory testing===

In order to further classify the extent of dysgeusia and clinically measure the sense of taste, gustatory testing may be performed. Gustatory testing is performed either as a whole-mouth procedure or as a regional test. In both techniques, natural or electrical stimuli can be used. In regional testing, 20 to 50 µL of liquid stimulus is presented to the [[anterior]] and [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] tongue using a pipette, soaked filter-paper disks, or cotton swabs.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt; In whole mouth testing, small quantities (2-10 mL) of solution are administered, and the patient is asked to swish the solution around in the mouth.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt;

[[Sensory threshold|Threshold]] tests for [[sucrose]] (sweet), [[citric acid]] (sour), [[sodium chloride]] (salty), and [[quinine]] or [[caffeine]] (bitter) are frequently performed with natural stimuli. One of the most frequently used techniques is the "three-drop test."&lt;ref name=Ahne&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahne|first1=Gabi|last2=Erras|first2=Angelo|last3=Hummel|first3=Thomas|last4=Kobal|first4=Gerd|title=Assessment of Gustatory Function by Means of Tasting Tablets|journal=The Laryngoscope|date=August 2000|volume=110|issue=8|pages=1396–1401|doi=10.1097/00005537-200008000-00033|pmid=10942148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this test, three drops of liquid are presented to the subject. One of the drops is of the taste stimulus, and the other two drops are pure water.&lt;ref name=Ahne /&gt; Threshold is defined as the concentration at which the patient identifies the taste correctly three times in a row.&lt;ref name=Ahne /&gt;

Suprathreshold tests, which provide intensities of taste stimuli above threshold levels, are used to assess the patient's ability to differentiate between different intensities of taste and to estimate the magnitude of suprathreshold loss of taste. From these tests, ratings of pleasantness can be obtained using either the direct scaling or magnitude matching method and may be of value in the diagnosis of dysgeusia. Direct scaling tests show the ability to discriminate among different intensities of stimuli and whether a stimulus of one quality (sweet) is stronger or weaker than a stimulus of another quality (sour).&lt;ref name=Seiden&gt;Seiden, Allen M., “Taste and Smell Disorders (Rhinology &amp; Sinusology),” Thieme Publishing Group Aug. 2000: 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct scaling cannot be used to determine if a taste stimulus is being perceived at abnormal levels. In this case, magnitude matching is used, in which a patient is asked to rate the intensities of taste stimuli and stimuli of another [[sensory system]], such as the loudness of a tone, on a similar scale.&lt;ref name=Seiden /&gt; For example, the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center asks patients to rate the intensities of NaCl, sucrose, citric acid and quinine-HCl stimuli, and the loudness of 1000&amp;nbsp;Hz tones.&lt;ref name=Seiden /&gt; Assuming normal hearing, the results of this cross-sensory test show the relative strength of the sense of taste in relation to the loudness of the auditory stimulus. Although many of the tests are based on ratings using the direct scaling method, some tests do use the magnitude-matching procedure.

Other tests include identification or discrimination of common taste substances. [[Topical anesthesia]] of the tongue has been reported to be of use in the diagnosis of dysgeusia as well, since it has been shown to relieve the symptoms of dysgeusia temporarily.&lt;ref name=Hummel /&gt; In addition to techniques based on the administration of chemicals to the tongue, [[electrogustometry]] is frequently used. It is based on the induction of gustatory sensations by means of an anodal electrical [[direct current]]. Patients usually report sour or metallic sensations similar to those associated with touching both poles of a live battery to the tongue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stillman|first1=JA|last2=Morton|first2=RP|last3=Goldsmith|first3=D|title=Automated electrogustometry: a new paradigm for the estimation of taste detection thresholds|journal=Clinical Otolaryngology and Allied Sciences|date=April 2000|volume=25|issue=2|pages=120–5|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2273.2000.00328.x|pmid=10816215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although electrogustometry is widely used, there seems to be a poor correlation between electrically and chemically induced sensations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Claire|last2=Quiñonez|first2=Carlo|last3=Nordin|first3=Steven|title=Reliability and Validity of Electrogustometry and its Application to Young and Elderly Persons|journal=Chemical Senses|date=1995|volume=20|issue=5|pages=499–503|doi=10.1093/chemse/20.5.499|pmid=8564424}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diagnostic tools===

Certain diagnostic tools can also be used to help determine the extent of dysgeusia. [[Electrophysiology|Electrophysiological]] tests and simple reflex tests may be applied to identify abnormalities in the [[nerve]]-to-[[brainstem]] pathways. For example, the [[blink reflex]] may be used to evaluate the integrity of the [[trigeminal nerve]]–[[Pontine nuclei|pontine brainstem]]–[[facial nerve]] pathway, which may play a role in gustatory function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jääskeläinen|first1=Satu K|last2=Forssell|first2=Heli|last3=Tenovuo|first3=Olli|title=Abnormalities of the blink reflex in burning mouth syndrome|journal=Pain|date=December 1997|volume=73|issue=3|pages=455–460|doi=10.1016/S0304-3959(97)00140-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Structural imaging is routinely used to investigate [[lesions]] in the taste pathway. [[Magnetic resonance imaging]] allows direct visualization of the [[cranial nerves]].&lt;ref name=Lell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lell|first1=M|last2=Schmid|first2=A|last3=Stemper|first3=B|last4=Maihöfner|first4=C|last5=Heckmann|first5=JG|last6=Tomandl|first6=BF|title=Simultaneous involvement of third and sixth cranial nerve in a patient with Lyme disease|journal=Neuroradiology|date=18 December 2002|volume=45|issue=2|pages=85–7|doi=10.1007/s00234-002-0904-x|pmid=12592489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it provides significant information about the type and cause of a lesion.&lt;ref name=Lell /&gt; Analysis of [[mucous membranes|mucosal]] [[blood flow]] in the oral cavity in combination with the assessment of [[autonomous]] [[cardiovascular]] factors appears to be useful in the diagnosis of [[autonomic nervous system]] disorders in [[burning mouth syndrome]] and in patients with inborn disorders, both of which are associated with gustatory dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckmann|first1=Josef G.|last2=Hilz|first2=Max J.|last3=Hummel|first3=Thomas|last4=Popp|first4=Michael|last5=Marthol|first5=Harald|last6=Neundörfer|first6=Bernhard|last7=Heckmann|first7=Siegfried M.|title=Oral mucosal blood flow following dry ice stimulation in humans|journal=Clinical Autonomic Research|date=October 2000|volume=10|issue=5|pages=317–321|doi=10.1007/BF02281116|pmid=11198489}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cell cultures]] may also be used when fungal or bacterial infections are suspected.

In addition, the analysis of [[saliva]] should be performed, as it constitutes the environment of [[taste|taste receptors]], including transport of tastes to the receptor and protection of the taste receptor.&lt;ref name=Matsuo&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsuo|first1=R|title=Role of Saliva in the Maintenance of Taste Sensitivity|journal=Critical Reviews in Oral Biology &amp; Medicine|date=April 2000|volume=11|issue=2|pages=216–229|doi=10.1177/10454411000110020501|pmid=12002816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typical clinical investigations involve sialometry and sialochemistry.&lt;ref name=Matsuo /&gt; Studies have shown that [[micrograph|electron micrographs]] of taste receptors obtained from saliva samples indicate [[pathological]] changes in the taste buds of patients with dysgeusia and other gustatory disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henkin|first1=Robert I.|title=Idiopathic Hypogeusia With Dysgeusia, Hyposmia, and Dysosmia|journal=JAMA|date=26 July 1971|volume=217|issue=4|pages=434–40|doi=10.1001/jama.1971.03190040028006|pmid=5109029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatments==

===Artificial saliva and pilocarpine===

Because medications have been linked to approximately 22% to 28% of all cases of dysgeusia, researching a treatment for this particular cause has been important.&lt;ref name=Giudice&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giudice|first1=M.|title=Taste Disturbances Linked to Drug Use: Change in Drug Therapy May Resolve Symptoms|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal / Revue des Pharmaciens du Canada|date=1 March 2006|volume=139|issue=2|pages=70–73|doi=10.1177/171516350613900208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Xerostomia]], or a decrease in saliva flow, can be a side effect of many drugs, which, in turn, can lead to the development of taste disturbances such as dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Patients can lessen the effects of xerostomia with breath mints, sugarless gum, or lozenges, or physicians can increase saliva flow with artificial saliva or oral [[pilocarpine]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Artificial saliva mimics the characteristics of natural saliva by lubricating and protecting the mouth but does not provide any digestive or enzymatic benefits.&lt;ref name=Preetha&gt;Preetha, A. and R. Banerjee, "Comparison of Artificial Saliva Substitutes, ''Trends in Biomaterials and Artificial Organs'', Jan. 2005: 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilocarpine is a [[cholinergic]] drug meaning it has the same effects as the [[neurotransmitter]] [[acetylcholine]]. Acetylcholine has the function of stimulating the [[salivary glands]] to actively produce saliva.&lt;ref name="Medications and Drugs"&gt;"Medications and Drugs," 6 May 2004, 25 Oct. 2009, &lt;http://www.medicinenet.com/pilocarpine/article.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in saliva flow is effective in improving the movement of tastants to the [[taste buds]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt;

===Zinc deficiency===

====Zinc supplementation====

[[Image:Zinc gluconate.png|thumb|right|alt=Zinc Gluconate.|Zinc Gluconate.]]

Approximately one half of drug-related taste distortions are caused by a [[zinc deficiency]].&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Many medications are known to [[chelate]], or bind, [[zinc]], preventing the element from functioning properly.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; Due to the causal relationship of insufficient zinc levels to taste disorders, research has been conducted to test the efficacy of zinc supplementation as a possible treatment for dysgeusia. In a randomized clinical trial, fifty patients suffering from [[idiopathic]] dysgeusia were given either zinc or a lactose [[placebo]].&lt;ref name=Heckman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heckmann|first1=SM|last2=Hujoel|first2=P|last3=Habiger|first3=S|last4=Friess|first4=W|last5=Wichmann|first5=M|last6=Heckmann|first6=JG|last7=Hummel|first7=T|title=Zinc gluconate in the treatment of dysgeusia--a randomized clinical trial|journal=Journal of Dental Research|date=1 January 2005|volume=84|issue=1|pages=35–8|doi=10.1177/154405910508400105|pmid=15615872|url=https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-fau/files/2919/heckmann_zinc_4148.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients prescribed the zinc reported experiencing improved taste function and less severe symptoms compared to the control group, suggesting that zinc may be a beneficial treatment.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; The efficacy of zinc, however, has been ambiguous in the past. In a second study, 94% of patients who were provided with zinc supplementation did not experience any improvement in their condition.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt; This ambiguity is most likely due to small sample sizes and the wide range of causes of dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Heckman /&gt; A recommended daily oral dose of 25–100&amp;nbsp;mg appears to be an effective treatment for taste dysfunction provided that there are low levels of zinc in the [[blood serum]].&lt;ref name=Heyneman&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heyneman|first1=Catherine A|title=Zinc Deficiency and Taste Disorders|journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy|date=February 1996|volume=30|issue=2|pages=186–187|doi=10.1177/106002809603000215|pmid=8835055}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a sufficient amount of evidence to determine whether or not zinc supplementation is able to treat dysgeusia when low zinc concentrations are not detected in the blood.&lt;ref name=Heyneman /&gt;

====Zinc infusion in chemotherapy====

It has been reported that approximately 68% of cancer patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] experience disturbances in sensory perception such as dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Hong&gt;Hong, Jae Hee, et al., "Taste and Odor Abnormalities in Cancer Patients," ''The Journal of Supportive Oncology'', Mar./Apr. 2009: 59-64.&lt;/ref&gt; In a pilot study involving twelve lung cancer patients, chemotherapy drugs were infused with zinc in order to test its potential as a treatment.&lt;ref name=Yamagata&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yamagata|first1=T|last2=Nakamura|first2=Y|last3=Yamagata|first3=Y|last4=Nakanishi|first4=M|last5=Matsunaga|first5=K|last6=Nakanishi|first6=H|last7=Nishimoto|first7=T|last8=Minakata|first8=Y|last9=Mune|first9=M|last10=Yukawa|first10=S|title=The pilot trial of the prevention of the increase in electrical taste thresholds by zinc containing fluid infusion during chemotherapy to treat primary lung cancer|journal=Journal of Experimental &amp; Clinical Cancer Research : CR|date=December 2003|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557–63|pmid=15053297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results indicated that, after two weeks, no taste disturbances were reported by the patients who received the zinc-supplemented treatment while most of the patients in the control group who did not receive the zinc reported taste alterations.&lt;ref name=Yamagata /&gt; A multi-institutional study involving a larger sample size of 169 patients, however, indicated that zinc-infused chemotherapy did not have an effect on the development of taste disorders in cancer patients.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; An excess amount of zinc in the body can have negative effects on the [[immune system]], and physicians must use caution when administering zinc to [[immunocompromised]] cancer patients.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; Because taste disorders can have detrimental effects on a patient's quality of life, more research needs to be conducted concerning possible treatments such as zinc supplementation.&lt;ref name=Halyard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Halyard|first1=MY|title=Taste and smell alterations in cancer patients--real problems with few solutions|journal=The Journal of Supportive Oncology|date=2008|volume=7|issue=2|pages=68–9|pmid=19408460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Altering drug therapy===

[[Image:Eprosartan.svg|thumb|right|alt=Eprosartan.|[[Eprosartan]].]]

The effects of drug-related dysgeusia can often be reversed by stopping the patient's regimen of the taste altering medication.&lt;ref name=Bromley&gt;Bromley, Steven M., "Smell and Taste Disorders: A Primary Care Approach," American Family Physician 15 Jan. 2000, 23 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.aafp.org/afp/20000115/427.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, a forty-eight-year-old woman who was suffering from [[hypertension]] was being treated with [[valsartan]].&lt;ref name=Castells&gt;Castells, Xavier, et al., "Drug Points: Dysgeusia and Burning Mouth Syndrome by Eprosartan," ''British Medical Journal'', 30 Nov. 2002: 1277.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this drug's inability to treat her condition, she began taking a regimen of [[eprosartan]], an [[angiotensin II receptor antagonist]].&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; Within three weeks, she began experiencing a metallic taste and a burning sensation in her mouth that ceased when she stopped taking the medication.&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; When she began taking eprosartan on a second occasion, her dysgeusia returned.&lt;ref name=Castells /&gt; In a second case, a fifty-nine-year-old man was prescribed [[amlodipine]] in order to treat his hypertension.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadasivam|first1=Balakrishnan|last2=Jhaj|first2=Ratinder|title=Dysgeusia with amlodipine ? a case report|journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology|date=February 2007|volume=63|issue=2|pages=253|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2006.02727.x|pmid=17274793|pmc=2000565}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight years of taking the drug, he developed a loss of taste sensation and numbness in his tongue.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; When he ran out of his medication, he decided not to obtain a refill and stopped taking amlodipine.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; Following this self-removal, he reported experiencing a return of his taste sensation.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; Once he refilled his prescription and began taking amlodipine a second time, his taste disturbance reoccurred.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; These two cases suggest that there is an association between these drugs and taste disorders. This link is supported by the "de-challenge" and "re-challenge" that took place in both instances.&lt;ref name=Sadasivam /&gt; It appears that drug-induced dysgeusia can be alleviated by reducing the drug's dose or by substituting a second drug from the same class.&lt;ref name=Giudice /&gt;

===Alpha lipoic acid===

[[Image:AlphaLipoicAcid.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Alpha Lipoic Acid.|[[Alpha Lipoic Acid]].]]

[[Alpha lipoic acid]] (ALA) is an [[antioxidant]] that is made naturally by human cells.&lt;ref name=UMMC&gt;University of Maryland Medical Center, "Alpha-lipoic Acid," 26 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/alpha-lipoic-000285.htm&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be administered in capsules or can be found in foods such as red meat, organ meats, and yeast.&lt;ref name=UMMC /&gt; Like other antioxidants, it functions by ridding the body of harmful [[free radicals]] that can cause damage to tissues and organs.&lt;ref name=UMMC /&gt; It has an important role in the [[Krebs cycle]] as a [[coenzyme]] leading to the production of antioxidants, intracellular [[glutathione]], and nerve-growth factors.&lt;ref name=Femiano&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Femiano|first1=F|last2=Scully|first2=C|last3=Gombos|first3=F|title=Idiopathic dysgeusia; an open trial of alpha lipoic acid (ALA) therapy|journal=International Journal of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|date=December 2002|volume=31|issue=6|pages=625–8|doi=10.1054/ijom.2002.0276|pmid=12521319}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal research has also uncovered the ability of ALA to improve [[nerve conduction velocity]].&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; Because flavors are perceived by differences in [[electric potential]] through specific nerves innervating the tongue, idiopathic dysgeusia may be a form of a [[neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; ALA has proven to be an effective treatment for [[burning mouth syndrome]] spurring studies in its potential to treat dysgeusia.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; In a study of forty-four patients diagnosed with the disorder, one half was treated with the drug for two months while the other half, the control group, was given a placebo for two months followed by a two-month treatment of ALA.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; The results reported show that 91% of the group initially treated with ALA reported an improvement in their condition compared to only 36% of the control group.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; After the control group was treated with ALA, 72% reported an improvement.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt; This study suggests that ALA may be a potential treatment for patients and supports that full double blind randomized studies should be performed.&lt;ref name=Femiano /&gt;

===Managing dysgeusia===

In addition to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using non-metallic silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold in order to reduce any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using [[sialogogue]]s such as chewing sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva.&lt;ref name=Hong /&gt; When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt;

===Psychological impacts===

People who suffer from dysgeusia are also forced to manage the impact that the disorder has on their quality of life. An altered taste has effects on food choice and intake and can lead to [[weight loss]], [[malnutrition]], impaired immunity, and a decline in health.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt; Patients diagnosed with dysgeusia must use caution when adding sugar and salt to food and must be sure not to overcompensate for their lack of taste with excess amounts.&lt;ref name=Bromley /&gt; Since the elderly are often on multiple medications, they are at risk for taste disturbances increasing the chances of developing [[Depression (mood)|depression]], loss of appetite, and extreme weight loss.&lt;ref name=Padala&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padala|first1=Kalpana P.|last2=Hinners|first2=Cheryl K.|last3=Padala|first3=Prasad R.|title=Mirtazapine Therapy for Dysgeusia in an Elderly Patient|journal=The Primary Care Companion to the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|date=14 July 2006|volume=08|issue=3|pages=178–180|doi=10.4088/PCC.v08n0310b|pmid=16912823|pmc=1540398}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is cause for an evaluation and management of their dysgeusia. In patients undergoing chemotherapy, taste distortions can often be severe and make compliance with cancer treatment difficult.&lt;ref name=Yamagata /&gt; Other problems that may arise include [[anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] and behavioral changes that can be misinterpreted as psychiatric delusions regarding food.&lt;ref name=Bicknell&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bicknell|first1=JM|last2=Wiggins|first2=RV|title=Taste disorder from zinc deficiency after tonsillectomy|journal=The Western Journal of Medicine|date=October 1988|volume=149|issue=4|pages=457–60|pmid=3227690|pmc=1026505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms including [[paranoia]], [[amnesia]], cerebellar malfunction, and [[lethargy]] can also manifest when undergoing [[histidine]] treatment.&lt;ref name=Bicknell /&gt; This makes it critical that these patients' dysgeusia is either treated or managed in order to improve their quality of life.

==Future research==

Every year, more than 200,000 individuals see their physicians concerning [[chemosensory]] problems, and many more taste disturbances are never reported.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD&gt;National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, "Taste Disorders," 25 June 2008, 23 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/smelltaste/taste.asp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large number of persons affected by taste disorders, basic and clinical research are receiving support at different institutions and chemosensory research centers across the country.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD /&gt; These taste and smell clinics are focusing their research on better understanding the mechanisms involved in gustatory function and taste disorders such as dysgeusia. For example, the [[National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders]] is looking into the mechanisms underlying the key receptors on taste cells and applying this knowledge to the future of medications and artificial food products.&lt;ref name=NIDOCD /&gt; Meanwhile, the Taste and Smell Clinic at the [[University of Connecticut Health Center]] is integrating behavioral, neurophysiological, and genetic studies involving stimulus concentrations and intensities in order to better understand taste function.&lt;ref name=UCHC&gt;The University of Connecticut Health Center, "Taste and Smell: Research," 26 Oct. 2009 &lt;http://www.uchc.edu/uconntasteandsmell/research/index.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these studies is to unearth the biological mechanisms underlying taste and to use this data to eliminate taste disorders in order to improve the lives of taste disorder sufferers.

{{Food safety}}
'''Food safety''' is a scientific discipline describing handling, [[food processing|preparation]], and [[food storage|storage of food]] in ways that prevent [[foodborne illness|food-borne illness]]. The occurrence of two or more cases of a similar illnesses resulting from the ingestion of a common food is known as a food-borne disease outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Texas Food Establishment Rules|last=|first=|publisher=Texas Department of State Health Services|year=2015|isbn=|location=Texas DSHS website|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes a number of routines that should be followed to avoid potential [[health|health hazards]]. In this way food safety often overlaps with [[food defense]] to prevent harm to consumers. The tracks within this line of thought are safety between industry and the market and then between the market and the consumer. In considering industry to market practices, food safety considerations include the origins of food including the practices relating to [[Food labelling regulations|food labeling]], food [[hygiene]], [[food additives]] and [[pesticide residue]]s, as well as policies on [[biotechnology]] and food and guidelines for the management of governmental [[import]] and [[export]] inspection and [[certification]] systems for foods. In considering market to consumer practices, the usual thought is that food ought to be safe in the market and the concern is safe delivery and preparation of the food for the consumer.

Food can transmit [[pathogens]] which can result in the illness or death of the person or other animals. The main mediums are [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[mold]], and [[fungus]] (which is Latin for [[mushroom]]). It can also serve as a growth and reproductive medium for pathogens. In developed countries there are intricate standards for food preparation, whereas in [[lesser developed countries]] there are fewer standards and less enforcement of those standards. Another main issue is simply the availability of adequate [[drinking water|safe water]], which is usually a critical item in the spreading of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=I. A. | last=Shiklomanov |url=http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacg/fulltext/worldr.pdf | format=PDF | title=Appraisal and Assessment of World Water Resources | work=Water International | publisher=International Water Resources Association | volume=25 |issue=1 |pages=11–32 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, food poisoning is 100% preventable. However this cannot be achieved due to the number of persons involved in the supply chain, as well as the fact that pathogens can be introduced into foods no matter how many precautions are taken.
The five key principles of food hygiene, according to [[WHO]], are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/consumer/5keys | title=Prevention of foodborne disease: Five keys to safer food | publisher=World Health Organisation | accessdate=2010-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Prevent contaminating food with [[pathogen]]s spreading from people, pets, and pests.
# Separate raw and cooked foods to prevent contaminating the cooked foods.
# Cook foods for the appropriate length of time and at the appropriate temperature to kill pathogens.
# Store food at the proper temperature.
# Use [[water quality|safe water]] and safe [[raw material]]s.

==Issues==

Food safety issues and regulations concern:
* [[Agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] practices
* [[Food manufacturing]] practices
* [[Food additive]]s
* [[Novel food]]s
* [[Genetically modified food]]s
* [[Food label]]
*Food Contamination

== Food contamination ==
Food contamination happens when food are corrupted with another substance. It can happen In the process of production, transportation, packaging, storage, sales and cooking process. The contamination can be physical, chemical and biological.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foodsafety.com.au/resources/articles/what-is-food-contamination|title=What is Food Contamination?|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical contamination ===
Physical contaminants (or ‘foreign bodies’) are objects such as hair, plant stalks or pieces of plastic and metal.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campdenbri.co.uk/services/physical-contaminants.php|title=Physical contaminants in food, identification and prevention at Campden BRI|website=www.campdenbri.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the foreign object comes into the food, it is a physical contaminant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; If the foreign objects are [[bacteria]], the case will a physical and biological contamination.

Common sources to create physical contaminations are: hair, glass or metal, pests, jewelry, dirt and fingernails.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chemical contamination ===
Chemical contamination happens when food is contaminated with a natural or artificial chemical substance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Common sources of chemical contamination can include: [[Pesticides in the United States|pesticides]], [[herbicide]]s, [[veterinary drugs]], contamination from environmental sources (water, air or soil pollution), cross-contamination during food processing, migration from food packaging materials, presence of [[Natural toxin|natural toxins]] or use of unapproved [[Food additive|food additives]] and [[Adulterant|adulterants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodsafetymagazine.com/magazine-archive1/februarymarch-2013/modern-analysis-of-chemical-contaminants-in-food/|title=Modern Analysis of Chemical Contaminants in Food - Food Safety Magazine|website=www.foodsafetymagazine.com|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemical contaminations usually share the following characteristics:&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/food-science/chemical-contamination-of-food|title=Chemical Contamination of Food - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*They are not intentionally added.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*Contamination can happen at one or more stages in food production.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*Illness is likely to result if consumers ingest enough of them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Biological contamination ===
Biological contamination refers to food that has been contaminated by substances produced by living creatures, such as humans, rodents, pests or [[Microorganism|microorganisms]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foodsafety.com.au/faq/what-are-the-different-types-of-food-contamination|title=What are the different types of food contamination?|access-date=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes [[Bacteria|bacterial]] contamination, [[virus|viral]] contamination, or [[Parasitism|parasite]] contamination that’s transferred through saliva, pest droppings, blood or faecal matter.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Bacterial contamination is the most common cause of food poisoning worldwide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  If an environment is high in [[starch]] or [[protein]], water, [[oxygen]], has a [[PH|neutral PH level]], and maintains a temperature between 5ºC and 60ºC (danger zone) for even a brief period of time (~0-20 minutes) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Danger Zone" |url=https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/danger-zone-40-f-140-f/ct_index |website=www.fsis.usda.gov |accessdate=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;, bacteria are likely to survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foodsafety.com.au/resources/articles/ood-safety-and-the-different-types-of-food-contamination|title=Food Safety and the Different Types of Food Contamination|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

;Example for biological contamination- Tainted Romaine Lettuce

Up to May, 2018, 26 states in the United States confirmed with an outbreak of the bacteria strain [[E. coli O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2018/05/north-dakota-confirms-e-coli-outbreak-case-26-states-hit/#.Wy1tvWWTXeQ|title=North Dakota confirms E. coli outbreak case; 26 states hit {{!}} Food Safety News|date=2018-05-06|work=Food Safety News|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several investigations show the contamination might have come from the Yuma, Ariz. growing region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/health/romaine-ecoli-outbreak-fda-cdc.html|title=Romaine Riddle: Why the E. Coli Outbreak Eludes Food Investigators|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outbreak, which began April 10, is the largest US flare-up of E. coli in a decade.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/05/31/fda-may-never-find-source-of-romaine-e-coli-outbreak/|title=FDA may never find source of Romaine E. coli outbreak|date=2018-05-31|work=The Mercury News|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One person in California has died.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; At least 14 of the people affected developed kidney failure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The most common symptoms of E. coli include [[diarrhea]], [[bloody diarrhea]], [[abdominal pain]], [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Safe Food Handling Procedures (From Market to Consumer)==
Proper storage, sanitary tools and work spaces, heating and cooling properly and to adequate temperatures, and avoiding contact with other uncooked foods can greatly reduce the chances of contamination. Tightly sealed water and air proof containers are good measures to limit the chances of both physical and biological contamination during storage. Using clean, sanitary surfaces and tools, free of debris, chemicals, standing liquids, and other food types (different than the kind currently being prepared, i.e. mixing vegetables/meats or beef/poultry) can help reduce the chance of all forms of contamination. However, even if all precautions have been taken and the food has been safely prepared and stored, bacteria can still form over time during storage. Food should be consumed within one to seven (1-7) days while it has been stored in a cold environment, or one to twelve (1-12) months if it was in a frozen environment (if it was frozen immediately after preparation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zeratsky |first1=Katherine |title=How long can you safely keep leftovers in the refrigerator? |url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/food-safety/faq-20058500 |website=Mayo Clinic |publisher=Katherine Zeratsky, R.D., L.D. |accessdate=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Storage Times for the Refrigerator and Freezer |url=https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/charts/storagetimes.html |website=FoodSafety.gov |accessdate=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of time before a food becomes unsafe to eat depends on the type of food it is, the surrounding environment, and the method with which it is kept out of the danger zone. For example, liquid foods like soup kept in a hot slow cooker (65° C) may last only a few hours before contamination, but fresh meats like beef and lamb that are promptly frozen (-2° C) can last up to a year. The geographical location can also be a factor if it is in close proximity to wildlife. Animals like rodents and insects can infiltrate a container or prep area if left unattended. Any food that has been stored while in an exposed environment should be carefully inspected before consuming, especially if it was at risk of being in contact with animals. Consider all forms of contamination when deciding if a food is safe or unsafe, as some forms or contamination will not leave any apparent signs. Bacteria may '''not''' be visible to the naked eye, debris (physical contamination) may be underneath the surface of a food, and chemicals may be clear or tasteless; the contaminated food may not change in smell, texture, appearance, or taste, and could still be contaminated. Any foods deemed contaminated should be disposed of immediately, and any surrounding food should be checked for additional contamination.

==ISO 22000==
[[ISO 22000]] is a standard developed by the International Organization for Standardization dealing with food safety. This is a general derivative of [[ISO 9000]].
ISO 22000 standard: The ISO 22000 international standard specifies the requirements for a food safety management system that involves interactive communication, system management, prerequisite programs, [[HACCP]] principles. ISO 22000 was first published in 2005. It is the culmination of all previous attempts from many sources and areas of food safety concern to provide an end product that is safe as possible from pathogens and other contaminants. Every 5 years standards are reviewed to determine whether a revision is necessary, to ensure that the standards remain as relevant and useful to businesses as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/iso-22000-revision.html|title=ISO 22000 Revision|author=[[International Organization Standards ISO ]]|publisher=[[International Organization Standards ISO]]|date=2017-07-01|accessdate=2017-11-25|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence==
A 2003 World Health Organization (WHO) report concluded that about 30% of reported [[food poisoning]] outbreaks in the WHO European Region occur in private homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.euro.who.int/eprise/main/who/mediacentre/PR/2003/20031212_2 | title=Several foodborne diseases are increasing in Europe | publisher=World Health Organisation | date=2003-12-16 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050416103540/http://www.euro.who.int/eprise/main/who/mediacentre/PR/2003/20031212_2 | archivedate=2005-04-16 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[WHO]] and [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], in the USA alone, annually, there are 76 million cases of foodborne illness leading to 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs237/en/ | publisher=World Health Organisation | title=Food safety and foodborne illness | accessdate=2010-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations by jurisdiction and agency==

===WHO and FAO===
In 1963, the [[WHO]] and [[FAO]] published the [[Codex Alimentarius]] which serves as an guideline to food safety.&lt;ref name="cafh"&gt;{{cite web |work=Codex Alimentarius |title=Codex Alimentarius and Food Hygiene |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/codex/Publications/Booklets/Hygiene/FoodHygiene_2003e.pdf | format=PDF | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations |accessdate=2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Unit 04 - Communication of Health &amp; Consumers Directorate-General of the European Commission (SANCO):
"The Codex, while being recommendations for voluntary application by members, Codex standards serve in many cases as a basis for national legislation. The reference made to Codex food safety standards in the World Trade Organizations' Agreement on [[Sanitary]] and [[wiktionary:Phytosanitary|Phytosanitary]] measures (SPS Agreement) means that Codex has far reaching implications for resolving trade disputes. WTO members that wish to apply stricter food safety measures than those set by Codex may be required to justify these measures scientifically."
So, an agreement made in 2003, signed by all member states, inclusive all EU, in the codex [http://www.codexalimentarius.org/input/download/standards/10401/CXS_240e.pdf Stan Codex 240 – 2003 ] for coconut milk, sulphite containing additives like E223 and E 224 are allowed till 30&amp;nbsp;mg/kg, does NOT mean, they are allowed into the EU, see [[Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed]] (RASFF) entries from Denmark: [https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/index.cfm?event=searchResultList 2012.0834]; 2011.1848; en 2011.168, "sulphite unauthorised in coconut milk from Thailand ". Same for polysorbate E 435: see 2012.0838 from Denmark, unauthorised polysorbates in coconut milk and, 2007.AIC from France. Only for the latter the EU amended its regulations with (EU) [http://faolex.fao.org/docs/pdf/eur114056.pdf No 583/2012] per 2 July 2012 to allow this additive, already used for decades and absolutely necessary.

===Australia===
{{See also|Food safety in Australia}}
[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]] requires all food businesses to implement food safety systems. These systems are designed to ensure food is safe to consume and halt the increasing incidence of food poisoning, and they include basic food safety training for at least one person in each business.
Food safety training is delivered in various forms by, among other organisations, Registered Training Organizations (RTOs), after which staff are issued a nationally recognised unit of competency code on their certificate.
Basic food safety training includes:

*Understanding the hazards associated with the main types of food and the conditions to prevent the growth of bacteria which can cause food poisoning and to prevent illness.
*Potential problems associated with product packaging such as leaks in vacuum packs, damage to packaging or pest infestation, as well as problems and diseases spread by pests.
*Safe food handling. This includes safe procedures for each process such as receiving, re-packing, food storage, preparation and cooking, cooling and re-heating, displaying products, handling products when serving customers, packaging, cleaning and sanitizing, pest control, transport and delivery. Also covers potential causes of cross contamination.
*Catering for customers who are particularly at risk of food-borne illness, as well as those with allergies or intolerance.
*Correct cleaning and sanitizing procedures, cleaning products and their correct use, and the storage of cleaning items such as brushes, mops and cloths.
*Personal hygiene, hand washing, illness, and protective clothing.

Food safety standards and requirements  are set out at the national level in the Food Standards Code, and brought Into force in each state by state-based Acts and Regulations. Legislation means that people responsible for selling or serving unsafe food may be liable for heavy fines.

===China===
{{Main|Food safety in China}}

Food safety is a growing concern in [[Agriculture in China|Chinese agriculture]]. The Chinese government oversees agricultural production as well as the manufacture of [[food packaging]], containers, chemical additives, drug production, and business regulation. In recent years, the Chinese government attempted to consolidate food regulation with the creation of the [[State Food and Drug Administration]] in 2003, and officials have also been under increasing public and international pressure to solve food safety problems. However, it appears that regulations are not well known by the trade. Labels used for "green" food, "organic" food and "pollution-free" food are not well recognized by traders and many are unclear about their meaning. A survey by the World Bank found that supermarket managers had difficulty in obtaining produce that met safety requirements and found that a high percentage of produce did not comply with established standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=World Bank and China Agriculture Press |year=2005 |url=http://www.worldbank.org.cn/English/Content/Food_Safety_Publication.pdf |format=PDF |title=China's Compliance with Food Safety Requirements for Fruits and Vegetables: Promoting Food Safety, Competitiveness, and Poverty Reduction }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional marketing systems, whether in China or the rest of Asia, presently provide little motivation or incentive for individual farmers to make improvements to either quality or safety as their produce tends to get grouped together with standard products as it progresses through the marketing channel. Direct linkages between farmer groups and traders or ultimate buyers, such as supermarkets, can help avoid this problem. Governments need to improve the condition of many markets through upgrading management and reinvesting market fees in physical infrastructure. [[Wholesale marketing|Wholesale markets]] need to investigate the feasibility of developing separate sections to handle fruits and vegetables that meet defined safety and quality standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Andrew W. | last=Shepherd | year=2006 | url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-a0709e.pdf | format=PDF | title=Quality and safety in the traditional horticultural marketing chains of Asia |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations | location=Rome }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The parliament of the [[European Union]] (EU) makes legislation in the form of directives and regulations, many of which are mandatory for member states and which therefore must be incorporated into individual countries' national legislation.  As a very large organisation that exists to remove barriers to trade between member states, and into which individual member states have only a proportional influence, the outcome is often seen as an excessively bureaucratic 'one size fits all' approach.  However, in relation to food safety the tendency to err on the side of maximum protection for the consumer may be seen as a positive benefit.  The EU parliament is informed on food safety matters by the [[European Food Safety Authority]].

Individual member states may also have other legislation and controls in respect of food safety, provided that they do not prevent trade with other states, and can differ considerably in their internal structures and approaches to the regulatory control of food safety.

From 13 December 2014, new legislation - the EU Food Information for Consumers Regulation 1169/2011 - require food businesses to provide [[allergy]] information on food sold unpackaged, in for example catering outlets, deli counters, bakeries and sandwich bars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/business-industry/allergy-guide|title=Allergy and intolerance: guidance for businesses - Food Standards Agency|publisher=Food Standards Agency|website=www.food.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
[[Agence nationale de sécurité sanitaire de l'alimentation, de l'environnement et du travail]] (anses) is a French governmental agency dealing with food safety.

=== Germany ===
The [[Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection]] (BMEL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection |url=http://www.bmelv.de/ |publisher=Bundesministerium für Ernährung, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Federal Ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany.
History: Founded as Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Foresting in 1949, this name did not change until 2001. Then the name changed to Federal Ministry of Consumer Protection, Food and Agriculture. At 22 November 2005, the name got changed again to its current state: Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. The reason for this last change was that all the resorts should get equal ranking which was achieved by sorting the resorts alphabetically.
Vision: A balanced and healthy diet with safe food, distinct consumer rights and consumer information for various areas of life, and a strong and sustainable agriculture as well as perspectives for our rural areas are important goals of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection (BMELV).
The [[Federal Office of Consumer Protection and Food Safety]] is under the control of the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. It exercises several duties, with which it contributes to safer food and thereby intensifies health-based consumer protection in Germany. Food can be manufactured and sold within Germany without a special permission, as long as it does not cause any damage on consumers’ health and meets the general standards set by the legislation. However, manufacturers, carriers, importers and retailers are responsible for the food they pass into circulation. They are obliged to ensure and document the safety and quality of their food with the use of in-house control mechanisms.

The US food system is regulated by numerous federal, state and local officials. Since 1906 tremendous progress has been made in producing safer foods as can be seen in the section below. Still, it has been criticized as lacking in "organization, regulatory tools, and not addressing food borne illness."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation   | last=Becker | first=Geoffrey | title=The Federal Food Safety System: A primer | publisher=Congressional Research Service | date=2010-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Federal level regulation ====
The [[Food and Drug Administration]] publishes the Food Code, a model set of guidelines and procedures that assists food control jurisdictions by providing a scientifically sound technical and legal basis for regulating the retail and food service industries, including restaurants, [[grocery stores]] and institutional foodservice providers such as [[nursing homes]]. Regulatory agencies at all levels of government in the United States use the FDA Food Code to develop or update food safety rules in their jurisdictions that are consistent with national food regulatory policy. According to the FDA, 48 of 56 states and [[US Territories|territories]], representing 79% of the US population, have adopted food codes patterned after one of the five versions of the Food Code, beginning with the 1993 edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/foodcode.html#intro |title=FDA Food Code |author= |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2008-09-01 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, federal regulations governing food safety are fragmented and complicated, according to a February 2007 report from the Government Accountability Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d07449t.pdf |format=PDF |volume=GAO-07-449T | title=High-Risk Designation Can Bring Needed Attention to Fragmented System | work=Federal Oversight of Food Safety |publisher=Government Accountability Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 15 agencies sharing oversight responsibilities in the food safety system, although the two primary agencies are the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS), which is responsible for the safety of meat, poultry, and processed egg products, and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), which is responsible for virtually all other foods.

The Food Safety and Inspection Service has approximately 7,800 inspection program personnel working in nearly 6,200 federally inspected meat, poultry and processed egg establishments. FSIS is charged with administering and enforcing the Federal [[Meat Inspection Act]], the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, portions of the [[Agricultural Marketing Act]], the [[Humane Slaughter Act]], and the regulations that implement these laws. FSIS inspection program personnel inspect every animal before slaughter, and each carcass after slaughter to ensure public health requirements are met.  In fiscal year (FY) 2008, this included about 50 billion pounds of livestock carcasses, about 59 billion pounds of poultry carcasses, and about 4.3 billion pounds of processed egg products. At US borders, they also inspected 3.3 billion pounds of imported meat and poultry products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/PDF/Testimony_Petersen_031109.pdf |format=PDF |title=FSIS Testimony, March 11, 2009 |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== US legislation history ====
[[File:Inspecting a Candy Factory (FDA045) (7039500349).jpg|thumb|FDA official inspecting a candy factory c. 1911]]
Recognition of food safety issues and attempts to address them began after [[Upton Sinclair]] published the novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' in 1906. It was a fictional account of the lives of immigrants in the industrial cities in the US around this time. Sinclair spent nine months undercover as an employee in a Chicago meat plant doing research. The book inadvertently raised public concern about food safety and sanatization of the [[Chicago]] [[meat packing industry]]. Upon reading ''The Jungle'', President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] called on Congress to pass the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] and the [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]] (FMIA), which passed in 1906 and 1907 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/WhatWeDo/History/Origin/ucm054819.htm|title=Part I: The 1906 Food and Drugs Act and Its Enforcement|author=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]|date=2017-10-05|accessdate=2017-11-24|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws were the first to address food safety in the US Misbranding and [[adulteration]] were defined as they concerned [[food additives]] and [[truth in labeling]]. [[Food preservatives]] such as [[formaldehyde]] and [[borax]] used to disguise unsanitary production processes were also addressed.

The first test and major court battle involving the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]] was ''[[United States v. Forty Barrels &amp; Twenty Kegs of Coca-Cola]]'', an attempt to outlaw [[Coca-Cola]] due to its excessive [[caffeine]] content. The [[Meat Inspection Act]] led to the formation of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). Between 1906 and 1938, acts were created that monitored food coloration additives, and other chemical additives such as [[preservatives]], as well as [[food labeling]] and [[food marketing]].

During the winter of 1924–1925, the worst food-borne illness to date in the US occurred because of improper handling of oysters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/03/editors-note-in-the-winter/#.Whht0kqnHIV|title=Oyster-Borne Typhoid Fever Killed 150 in Winter of 1924-25|author=[[Food Safety News]]|publisher=[[Food Safety News]]|date=2012-03-28|accessdate=2017-11-24|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This produced a [[typhoid fever]] epidemic, and food-borne illness outbreaks gained national attention. Unfortunately, it was not until 1969 that the FDA began sanitization programs specifically for [[shellfish]] and [[milk]], and began its focus and implementation on the food service industry as a whole.
 
In 1970 the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) began keeping records on food-borne illness deaths. This was the beginning of effective record keeping that could be used to control and prevent similar outbreaks in the future. The first major food recall in the US was caused by canned mushrooms in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/02/19/archives/fda-is-recalling-more-mushrooms-for-botulism-check-checks-in-3.html|title=F.D.A. Is Recalling More Mushrooms For Botulism Check|author=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=The New York Times|date=1973-02-19|accessdate=2017-11-24|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outbreak of [[botulism]] produced the National Botulism Surveillance System. This system collected the data on all confirmed cases of botulism in the US This led to processing regulations for low-acid foods to ensure proper heat treating of canned foods. The Jack in the Box ''E. coli'' outbreak of 1993 led the Clinton administration to put $43 million into the [[Food Safety Initiative]] to create many of the common specific regulations in place today. This initiative produced regulations on seafood, meat, poultry, and shell-eggs. This initiative produced a program for DNA fingerprinting to help track outbreaks and to determine their source. It also called for a cooperative detection and response effort between the CDC, FDA, USDA and local agencies called FoodNet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/foodnet/index.html|title=Food Borne Disease Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet)|author=[[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]]|publisher=[[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]]|date=2017-03-03|accessdate=2017-02-24|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2011 the [[Food Safety Modernization Act]] (FSMA) produced what is considered the most significant food safety legislation in over 70 years. The significant difference between this and previous acts was that it shifted to focus from response and containment of food-borne disease outbreaks to their prevention. This act is still in the early implementation phase but gives the FDA authority to regulate the way foods are grown, processed, and harvested.

=====Industry pressure=====
There have been concerns over the efficacy of safety practices and food industry pressure on US regulators. A study reported by Reuters found that "the food industry is jeopardizing US public health by withholding information from food safety investigators or pressuring regulators to withdraw or alter policy designed to protect consumers". A survey found that 25% of US government inspectors and scientists surveyed have experienced during the past year corporate interests forcing their food safety agency to withdraw or to modify agency policy or action that protects consumers. Scientists have observed that management undercuts field inspectors who stand up for food safety against industry pressure. According to Dr. Dean Wyatt, a USDA veterinarian who oversees federal slaughterhouse inspectors, "Upper level management does not adequately support field inspectors and the actions they take to protect the food supply. Not only is there lack of support, but there's outright obstruction, retaliation and abuse of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Reuters | title=Industry Has Sway Over Food Safety System: US Study | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE68C39320100913 | date=2010-09-14 | archiveurl=http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2010/09/14-1 | archivedate=2010-09-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing number of food and beverage manufacturers are improving food safety standards by incorporating a food safety management system which automates all steps in the food quality management process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuchinski|first1=Kelly|title=Can Automation Reduce the Risk of Food Recalls?|url=http://blog.spartasystems.com/feed/can-automation-reduce-the-risk-of-food-recalls|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====State and local regulation====
[[File:Safe Shellfish (4496) (4493305743).jpg|thumb|FDA official and New Jersey state inspector review harvest of clams]]
A number of US [[States of the United States|states]] have their own meat inspection programs that substitute for USDA inspection for meats that are sold only in-state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/regulations_&amp;_policies/state_inspection_programs/ |title=FSIS State Inspection Programs | publisher=United States Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain state programs have been criticized for undue leniency to bad practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consumerfed.org/pdfs/CFA_stmt_on_OIG_report_state_inspected_meat_9.28.06.pdf |format=PDF |title=USDA Allowed State Meat Inspection Programs To Operate Even After Finding Cutting Boards Contaminated With Old Meat And Soot-Like Residues On Swine Carcasses |publisher=Consumer Federation of America |date=2006-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other state food safety programs supplement, rather than replace, Federal inspections, generally with the goal of increasing consumer confidence in the state's produce. For example, state health departments have a role in investigating outbreaks of food-borne disease bacteria, as in the case of the 2006 outbreak of [[Escherichia coli O157:H7|''Escherichia coli'' O157:H7]] (a pathogenic strain of  the ordinarily harmless bacteria, ''E. coli'') from processed spinach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.applications.dhs.ca.gov/pressreleases/store/pressreleases/06-76.html |title=State Health Department announces test results match genetic fingerprints to E. coli outbreak | work=Press releases | quote=ben 0987, 8765 | publisher=California Department of Health Services | date=2006-10-12 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107000546/http://www.applications.dhs.ca.gov/pressreleases/store/pressreleases/06-76.html | archivedate=2006-11-07 | deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health departments also promote better food processing practices to eliminate these threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dhs.ca.gov/fdb/HTML/food/Education%20Unit/ETU%20Info%20Page/ETU%20Homepage.htm |title=CDHS Education Training Unit |publisher=California Department of Health Services }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the [[US Food and Drug Administration]], several states that are major producers of fresh fruits and vegetables (including California, [[Arizona]] and Florida) have their own state programs to test produce for [[pesticide]] residues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/dept/factshts/residu2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pesticides and food: How we test for safety |publisher=California Department of Pesticide Regulation |date=June 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The food system represents one of the most significant components of the U.S. economy. It affects the social and economic well-being of nearly all Americans and plays a significant role in the well-being of the global community. The U.S. food and fiber system accounted for 18 percent of employment 4 percent of imported goods, and 11 percent of exports in 2011. The relative economic contribution of each various step of the U.S. food supply chain has changed significantly over the past 100 years. Generally speaking, the economic importance of the farm production subsector has steadily diminished relative to the shares of the other components of the food supply chain. 

Restaurants and other retail food establishments fall under state law and are regulated by state or local health departments. Typically these regulations require official inspections of specific design features, best food-handling practices, and certification of food handlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/ |title=New York Restaurant Inspection Information |publisher=The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210175708/http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/html/rii/index.shtml |archivedate=2005-12-10 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places a letter grade or numerical score must be prominently posted following each inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthylivingnyc.com/article/26 |title=NYC Health Dept.

For example California maintains the California Retail Food Code (CalCode), which is part of the Health and Safety Code and is based on most current and safe food handling practices in the retail industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emd.saccounty.net/EH/FoodProtect-RetailFood/Pages/CalCode.aspx|title=California Retail Food Code (CalCode)|website=www.emd.saccounty.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The Vietnam Food Administration is reafor managing food hygiene, safety, and quality and has made significant progress since its establishment in 1999. Food safety remains a high priority in Vietnam with the growth of export markets and increasing food imports raising the need to rapidly build capacity of the Food Administration in order to reduce threats of foodborne disease. The Food Administration has demonstrated commitment to the food safety challenges it faces, and has embarked on an innovative capacity building activity with technical assistance from the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/meeting/004/y3680e/Y3680E11.htm#P601_182715|title=FAO-WHO Global Forum of Food Safety Regulators - Proceedings|website=www.fao.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer labeling==
{{main|List of food labeling regulations}}

=== United Kingdom ===
Foodstuffs in the UK have one of two labels to indicate the nature of the deterioration of the product and any subsequent health issues.  EHO Food Hygiene certification is required to prepare and distribute food.  While there is no specified expiry date of such a qualification the changes in legislation it is suggested to update every five years.

[[Shelf life|Best before]] indicates a future date beyond which the food product ''may'' lose quality in terms of taste or texture amongst others, but does not imply any serious health problems if food is consumed beyond this date (within reasonable limits).

Use by indicates a legal date beyond which it is not permissible to sell a food product (usually one that deteriorates fairly rapidly after production) due to the potential serious nature of consumption of pathogens. Leeway is sometimes provided by producers in stating display until dates so that products are not at their limit of safe consumption on the actual date stated (this latter is voluntary and not subject to regulatory control). This allows for the variability in production, storage and display methods.

===United States===
With the exception of infant formula and baby foods which must be withdrawn by their expiration date, Federal law does not require expiration dates. For all other foods, except dairy products in some states, freshness dating is strictly voluntary on the part of manufacturers. In response to consumer demand, perishable foods are typically labelled with a Sell by date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa102102a.htm |title=Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 1: Expiration dating is not federally required on all products |publisher=About.com |work=Home Cooking }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is up to the consumer to decide how long after the Sell by date a package is usable. Other common dating statements are Best if used by, Use-by date, Expiration date, Guaranteed fresh &lt;date&gt;, and Pack date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homecooking.about.com/library/weekly/aa102102b.htm |title=Expiration, Use-by, and Sell-by Dates, Part 2: Deciphering food expiration codes can be tricky |publisher=About.com |work=Home Cooking }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of the Immaculate Conception''' are members of a [[Roman Catholic]] [[Religious institute (Catholic)|religious institute]] of [[Consecrated life|consecrated]] women, which was founded in Portugal in 1871. They follow the Rule of the [[Third Order Regular of St. Francis]].&lt;ref name="Altius moderamen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ream|first=David and Thérèse|title=Altius moderamen|url=http://www.nafra-sfo.org/formation%20materials/5.2-altius_moderamen-canon_303.pdf|work=The National Fraternity of the Secular Franciscan Order - USA|publisher=National Formation Commission|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as the term “hospitaller” indicates, focus their ministries on a spirit of medical care. Their charism emphasizes hospitality and service under the model of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref name="Province of Our Lady of the Mount"&gt;{{cite web|title=Province Of Our Lady Of The Mount.

The [[Religious sister|Sister]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s’ mission, as expressed by their foundress, Mother Maria Clara, is “to do good where good needs to be done.”  These words have paved the way for a large variety of [[apostolates]] including education, [[catechesis]], healthcare, [[Pastoral care|pastoral work]], assisting the elderly, missionary work, running orphanages, assisting immigrants, and assisting the homeless.  The local needs where each convent is located oftentimes determine the apostolates of the sisters who live there, although generally each sister is also able to choose her preferred field of ministry to carry out.  Ordinarily the [[Religious habit|habits]] that the sisters wear are grey, but those sisters working in the healthcare field don white habits while they are working.  The daily prayer life of the sisters in this order consists of [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], an hour of [[Eucharistic adoration]], [[Liturgy of the Hours]], and the [[rosary]].&lt;ref name="Province of Our Lady of the Mount"/&gt;&lt;ref name=CONFHIC&gt;{{cite web|title=Congregation of the Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of the Immaculate Conception|url=http://www.confhic.com/|work=Terra das Ideirs|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On June 15, 1843 [[Libânia do Carmo Galvão Mexia de Moura Telles de Albuquerque]] was born in [[Amadora]], Portugal. This third child of seven in a noble and devout Christian family had a very happy childhood until 1856 and 1857 when she suddenly lost her parents to a [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]] epidemic. At age 14 she entering a boarding school for orphaned nobility until the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]] who taught her were expelled from Portugal in 1882 due to the [[anticlerical]] laws then passed.

For five years Telles e Albuquerque then lived in the palace of the [[Marquis]] of Valada. In 1869 at the age of 26, she entered religious life as a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] [[nun]], receiving the name "Sister Maria Clara of the Infant Jesus".  She soon desired to form a new community that would serve the people of Portugal who were wounded in a time of political unrest.  Supported by Fr. Raimundo dos Anjos Beirão, she traveled to [[Calais]], France, for her [[novitiate]] formation under the Franciscan Hospitaller Sisters of that city, preparing to found a new community after her novitiate has been completed.  After professing her vows in France on April 14, 1871, she founded the first house of her new community, called the "Congregation of the Hospitaller Sisters of the Poor for the Love of God", in [[Lisbon]] on May 3, 1871.  Only five years later, on March 27, 1876, the congregation was approved by [[Pope Pius IX]].

Despite many trials, the new religious institute continued to grow rapidly with more and more convents being established. The large number of sick, poor, and orphaned people found relief in the houses which the Sisters opened to shelter and care for them. In 1886 the Sisters expanded their service to the Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], now part of India.

On December 1, 1899, Mother Maria Clara died.  Her remains are in the crypt of the chapel of the general [[motherhouse]] in Lisbon, where many people still come to pray and ask her intercession.  She was [[beatified]] on May 21, 2011 by [[Pope Benedict XVI]], and her [[canonization]] process continues.

==Legacy==
This international [[Congregation (Catholic)|congregation]] is now represented in fifteen countries. 

===United States===
In the United States, the sisters are located only in the state of California, residing in the Dioceses of [[Diocese of San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Fresno|Fresno]], and [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey in California|Monterey]].  The Hospitaller Sisters first came to the United States in 1960 in order to aid Portuguese immigrants.  These sisters ran and taught in schools, but their education and catechesis work has come to consist of teaching [[Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults]] and Faith Formation, or [[Confraternity of Christian Doctrine]].  The majority of the California sisters now are involved in healthcare.  In [[Los Banos, California|Los Banos]], where eleven sisters now live, the sisters run a non-profit house of residential care and skilled nursing for the elderly.  This facility, called New Bethany, after the village of [[Bethany]] that Jesus stayed in, was opened in 1999.  The sisters attend to their patients' physical needs, and to their spiritual needs through frequent public prayer and liturgy.  The sisters in the three California houses also visit the sick and bring them [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Holy Communion]].  The United States province is the smallest of the fifteen CONFHIC provinces worldwide, but has had a renewed interest in their lifestyle amongst young women who are [[Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church|discerning a religious vocation]].  The convent in San Jose is designated as the house of formation for American vocations.

==Cause==

Gonorrhea is caused by the bacterium ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''.&lt;ref name=CE07/&gt; Previous infection does not confer immunity - a person who has been infected can become infected again by exposure to someone who is infected. Infected persons may be able to infect others repeatedly without having any signs or symptoms of their own.

===Spread===

==Diagnosis==

Traditionally, gonorrhea was diagnosed with [[Gram stain]] and [[culture]]; however, newer [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR)-based testing methods are becoming more common.&lt;ref name=Sternak2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ljubin-Sternak|first1=Suncanica|last2=Mestrovic|first2=Tomislav|title=Review: Clamydia trachonmatis and Genital Mycoplasmias: Pathogens with an Impact on Human Reproductive Health|journal=Journal of Pathogens|page=7 |date=2014|volume=2014|issue=183167|doi=10.1155/2014/183167|pmid=25614838|pmc=4295611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barry PM, Klausner JD |title=The use of cephalosporins for gonorrhea: The impending problem of resistance |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=10 |issue=4 |pages=555–77 |date=March 2009 |pmid=19284360 |pmc=2657229 |doi=10.1517/14656560902731993 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In those failing initial treatment, culture should be done to determine sensitivity to antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Japan10/&gt;

Tests that use [[polymerase chain reaction]] ([[PCR]], aka nucleic acid amplification) to identify genes unique to ''N. gonorrhoeae'' are recommended for screening and diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. These PCR-based tests require a sample of urine, urethral swabs, or cervical/vaginal swabs. Culture (growing colonies of bacteria in order to isolate and identify them) and Gram-stain (staining of bacterial cell walls to reveal morphology) can also be used to detect the presence of ''N. gonorrhoeae'' in all specimen types except urine.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/Page/Document/RecommendationStatementFinal/chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-screening|title=Final Recommendation Statement: Chlamydia and Gonorrhea: Screening - US Preventive Services Task Force|website=www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/gonorrhea.htm|title=Gonococcal Infections - 2015 STD Treatment Guidelines|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If Gram-negative, oxidase-positive diplococci are visualized on direct Gram stain of urethral pus (male genital infection), no further testing is needed to establish the diagnosis of gonorrhea infection.&lt;ref name=Lev13th&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871305336|title=Review of medical microbiology and immunology|last=Levinson|first=Warren|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780071818117|edition=Thirteenth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=871305336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, in the case of female infection direct Gram stain of cervical swabs is not useful because the ''N. gonorrhoeae'' organisms are less concentrated in these samples. The chances of false positives are increased as Gram-negative diplococci native to the normal vaginal flora cannot be distinguished from ''N. gonorrhoeae.'' Thus, cervical swabs must be cultured under the conditions described above. If oxidase positive, Gram-negative diplococci are isolated from a culture of a cervical/vaginal swab specimen, then the diagnosis is made. Culture is especially useful for diagnosis of infections of the throat, recutum, eyes, blood, or joints – areas where PCR-based tests are not well established in all labs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Culture is also useful for antimicrobial sensitivity testing, treatment failure, and epidemiological purposes (outbreaks, surveillance).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ng|first=Lai-King|last2=Martin|first2=Irene E|date=2005|title=The laboratory diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae|journal=The Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases &amp; Medical Microbiology|volume=16|issue=1|pages=15–25|issn=1712-9532|pmc=2095009|pmid=18159523|doi=10.1155/2005/323082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In patients who may have disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI), all possible mucosal sites should be cultured (e.g., pharynx, cervix, urethra, rectum).&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/std/tg2015/clinical.htm section on prevention methods&lt;/ref&gt; Three sets of blood cultures should also be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|218059|Gonorrhea|overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synovial fluid should be collected in cases of [[septic arthritis]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

== Screening ==

The [[United States Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF) recommends screening for gonorrhea in women at increased risk of infection, which includes all sexually active women younger than 25 years. Extragenital gonorrhea and chlamydia are highest in [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meyers D |title=USPSTF recommendations for STI screening |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=77 |issue=6 |pages=819–24 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18386598 |doi= |url= |author2=Wolff T |author3=Gregory K |display-authors=3 |last4=Marion |first4=L |last5=Moyer |first5=V |last6=Nelson |first6=H |last7=Petitti |first7=D |last8=Sawaya |first8=GF}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--Gonorrheal infections in young women are missed with genital-only testing.--&gt;&lt;!-- does not appear to be discussed in the source --&gt;Additionally, the USPSTF also recommends routine screening in people who have previously tested positive for gonorrhea or have multiple sexual partners and individuals who use condoms inconsistently, provide sexual favors for money, or have sex while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.&lt;ref name="Smith2015"/&gt;

Screening for gonorrhea in women who are (or intend to become) pregnant, and who are found to be at high risk for [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, is recommended as part of [[prenatal care in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icsi.org/prenatal_care_4/prenatal_care__routine__full_version__2.html Health Care Guideline: Routine Prenatal Care.

== Prevention ==
{{see also|Safe sex}}

As with most sexually transmitted diseases, the risk of infection can be reduced significantly by the correct use of [[condom]]s and can be removed almost entirely by limiting sexual activities to a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected person.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004526/ section: Prevention] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720041540/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0004526/ |date=20 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm section: How can gonorrhea be prevented?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216052928/http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm |date=16 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those previously infected are encouraged to return for follow up care to make sure that the infection has been eliminated. In addition to the use of phone contact, the use of email and text messaging have been found to improve the re-testing for infection.&lt;ref name="DesaiWoodhall2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Desai|first1=Monica|last2=Woodhall|first2=Sarah C|last3=Nardone|first3=Anthony|last4=Burns|first4=Fiona|last5=Mercey|first5=Danielle|last6=Gilson|first6=Richard|title=Active recall to increase HIV and STI testing: a systematic review|journal=Sexually Transmitted Infections|volume=91|issue=5|year=2015|pages=sextrans–2014–051930|issn=1368-4973|doi=10.1136/sextrans-2014-051930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newborn babies coming through the birth canal are given [[erythromycin]] ointment in the eyes to prevent blindness from infection. The underlying gonorrhea should be treated; if this is done then usually a good prognosis will follow.&lt;ref name=Sad2016/&gt;

== Treatment  ==

===Antibiotics===
[[File:PenicillinPSAedit.jpg|thumb|[[Penicillin]] entered mass production in 1944 and revolutionized the treatment of several venereal diseases.]]
As of 2010, injectable [[ceftriaxone]] is one of the few effective antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Japan10 /&gt; This is typically given in combination with either [[azithromycin]] or [[doxycycline]].&lt;ref name=MMWR2012/&gt; As of 2015 and 2016 the CDC and WHO only recommends both ceftriaxone and azithromycin.&lt;ref name=CDC2016Tx/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2017Res&gt;{{cite web|title=Antibiotic-resistant gonorrhoea on the rise, new drugs needed|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/Antibiotic-resistant-gonorrhoea/en/|website=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 July 2017|date=7 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709050132/http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/Antibiotic-resistant-gonorrhoea/en/|archivedate=9 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of increasing rates of [[antibiotic resistance]] local susceptibility patterns must be taken into account when deciding on treatment.&lt;ref name=Japan10/&gt;&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"/&gt;

Adults may have eyes infected with gonorrhoea and require proper personal hygiene and medications.&lt;ref name=Sad2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sadowska-Przytocka|first1=A|last2=Czarnecka-Operacz|first2=M|last3=Jenerowicz|first3=D|last4=Grzybowski|first4=A|title=Ocular manifestations of infectious skin diseases.|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|date=2016|volume=34|issue=2|pages=124–8|pmid=26903179|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2015.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among persons in the United States between 14 and 39 years of age, 46% of people with gonorrheal infection also have chlamydial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Datta|first=SD|author2=Sternberg, M |author3=Johnson, RE |author4=Berman, S |author5=Papp, JR |author6=McQuillan, G |author7= Weinstock, H |title=Gonorrhea and chlamydia in the United States among persons 14 to 39 years of age, 1999 to 2002.|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=Jul 17, 2007|volume=147|issue=2|pages=89–96|pmid=17638719|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-147-2-200707170-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual partners===
It is recommended that sexual partners be tested and potentially treated.&lt;ref name=Japan10/&gt; One option for treating sexual partners of people infected is [[patient-delivered partner therapy]] (PDPT), which involves providing prescriptions or medications to the person to take to his/her partner without the health care provider's first examining him/her.&lt;ref name=EPTFinalReport2006&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf "Expedited partner therapy in the management of sexually transmitted diseases"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091102171329/http://cdc.gov/std/treatment/EPTFinalReport2006.pdf |date=2 November 2009 }}. February 2006. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States' [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)]] currently recommend that individuals who have been diagnosed and treated for gonorrhea avoid sexual contact with others until at least one week past the final day of treatment in order to prevent the spread of the bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonorrhea - CDC Fact Sheet|author=CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/Gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea.htm|access-date=17 October 2014|date=14 July 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216052928/http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antibiotic resistance===
Many antibiotics that were once effective including [[penicillin]], [[tetracycline]], and [[fluoroquinolones]] are no longer recommended because of high rates of resistance.&lt;ref name=Japan10/&gt; Resistance to [[cefixime]] has reached a level such that it is no longer recommended as a first-line agent in the United States, and if it is used a person should be tested again after a week to determine whether the infection still persists.&lt;ref name=MMWR2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|first=(CDC)|title=Update to CDC's Sexually Transmitted Diseases Treatment Guidelines, 2010: Oral Cephalosporins No Longer a Recommended Treatment for Gonococcal Infections.|journal=MMWR.

Gonorrhea if left untreated may last for weeks or months with higher risks of complications.&lt;ref name=CE07/&gt; One of the complications of gonorrhea is systemic dissemination resulting in skin [[pustule]]s or [[petechia]], [[septic arthritis]], [[meningitis]], or [[endocarditis]].&lt;ref name=CE07/&gt; This occurs in between 0.6 and 3% of infected women and 0.4 and 0.7% of infected men.&lt;ref name=CE07/&gt;

In men, [[Epididymitis|inflammation of the epididymis]], [[Prostatitis|prostate gland]], and [[Urethritis|urethra]] can result from untreated gonorrhea.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; &amp; Mitchell, Richard N.

Saunders Elsevier. pp. 705–706 {{ISBN|978-1-4160-2973-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In women, the most common result of untreated gonorrhea is [[pelvic inflammatory disease]]. Other complications include [[perihepatitis|inflammation of the tissue surrounding the liver]],&lt;ref name=Robbins/&gt; a rare complication associated with [[Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome]]; [[septic arthritis]] in the fingers, wrists, toes, and ankles; [[septic abortion]]; [[chorioamnionitis]] during pregnancy; neonatal or adult blindness from [[conjunctivitis]]; and [[infertility]]. Men who have had a gonorrhea infection have an increased risk of getting [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref name="CainiGandini2014"/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
[[File:Chart of gonorrhea infection rates (USA, 1941-2007).png|thumb|Gonorrhea—Rates: United States, 1941–2007]]
About 88 million cases of gonorrhea occur each year, out of the 448 million new cases of curable STI each year – that also includes syphilis, chlamydia and [[trichomoniasis]].&lt;ref name=WHOEpi14/&gt; In 2013, it caused about 3,200 deaths, up from 2,300 in 1990.&lt;ref name=GBD2013Death&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=10 January 2015|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(14)61682-2|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, 196 per 100,000 males 20 to 24 years old and 133 per 100,000 females 16 to 19 years old were diagnosed in 2005.&lt;ref name=CE07&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moran JS |title=Gonorrhoea |journal=Clin Evid (Online) |volume=2007 |issue= |pages= |year=2007 |pmid=19454057 |doi= |url= |pmc=2943790}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the CDC estimated that more than 820,000 people in the United States get a new gonorrheal infection each year. Fewer than half of these infections are reported to CDC. In 2011, 321,849 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the CDC. After the implementation of a national gonorrhea control program in the mid-1970s, the national gonorrhea rate declined from 1975 to 1997. After a small increase in 1998, the gonorrhea rate has decreased slightly since 1999. In 2004, the rate of reported gonorrheal infections was 113. 5 per 100,000 persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/Gonorrhea/STDFact-gonorrhea.htm|title=Gonorrhea – CDC Fact Sheet|publisher=CDC|date=29 May 2012|accessdate=2013-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216052928/http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm|archivedate=16 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization warned in 2017 of the spread of untreatable strains of gonorrhea, following analysis of at least three cases in Japan, France and Spain, which survived all antibiotic treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/07/untreatable-gonorrhoea-superbug-spreading-around-world-who-warns|title=Untreatable gonorrhoea 'superbug' spreading around world, WHO warns|publisher=''The Daily Telegraph|date=7 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707065204/https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/jul/07/untreatable-gonorrhoea-superbug-spreading-around-world-who-warns|archivedate=7 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:SheMayLookCleanBut.jpg|thumb|left|During World War II, the U.S. government used posters to warn military personnel about the dangers of gonorrhea and other [[sexually transmitted infections]].]]

Some scholars translate the biblical terms ''zav'' (for a male) and ''zavah'' (for a female) as gonorrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/metzora/nitzan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-11-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003062653/http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/metzora/nitzan.html |archivedate=3 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] was used as a treatment for gonorrhea. Surgeons' tools on board the recovered English warship the ''[[Mary Rose]]'' included a [[syringe]] that, according to some, was used to inject the mercury via the [[urinary meatus]] into any unfortunate crewman suffering from gonorrhea. The name "the clap", in reference to the disease, is recorded as early as the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=firstuseprimary&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Mirror for Magistrates]] |year= 1587 |first= John |last= Higgins }} as cited in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' entry for "clap"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1854, Dr. [[Wilhelm Gollmann]] addressed gonorrhea in his book, ''Homeopathic Guide to all Diseases Urinary and Sexual Organs''. He noted that the disease was common in [[prostitutes]] and [[homosexuals]] in large cities. Gollmann recommended the following as cures: [[aconitine|aconite]] to cure "shooting pains with soreness and inflammation;" mercury "for stitching pain with purulent discharge;" ''[[nux vomica]]'' and [[sulphur]] "when the symptoms are complicated with [[hemorrhoids]] and stricture of the [[rectum]]. Other [[Pharmaceutical drug|remedies]] include [[argentum]], ''aurum'' ([[gold]]), [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]], [[calcarea]], [[ignatia amara|ignatia]], [[phosphorus]], and [[List of homeopathic preparations#Sepia|sepia]].&lt;ref name="Gollmann-Hempel"/&gt;

[[Silver nitrate]] was one of the widely used drugs in the 19th century. However, It became replaced by [[Protargol]]. [[Arthur Eichengrün]] invented this type of colloidal silver, which was marketed by [[Bayer]] from 1897 on&lt;!-- style change needed --&gt;. The silver-based treatment was used until the first antibiotics came into use in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Max Bender| title = Ueber neuere Antigonorrhoica (insbes. Argonin und Protargol)| journal = Archives of Dermatological Research| year = 1898| volume = 43| issue = 1| pages = 31–36| doi = 10.1007/BF01986890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medlineneogono&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|001606|Neonatal Conjunctivitis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact time of onset of gonorrhea as prevalent disease or epidemic cannot be accurately determined from the historical record. One of the first reliable notations occurs in the Acts of the (English) Parliament. In 1161, this body passed a law to reduce the spread of "...the perilous infirmity of burning".&lt;ref&gt;W Sanger. History of Prostitution. NY, Harper, 1910.&lt;/ref&gt; The symptoms described are consistent with, but not diagnostic of, gonorrhea. A similar decree was passed by [[Louis IX]] in France in 1256, replacing regulation with banishment.&lt;ref&gt;P. LaCroix. The History of Prostitution—Vol. 2. NY, MacMillan, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar symptoms were noted at the [[Siege of Acre (1291)|siege of Acre]] by [[Crusaders]].

Coincidental to, or dependent on, the appearance of a gonorrhea epidemic, several changes occurred in European medieval society. Cities hired [[public health]] doctors to treat afflicted patients without right of refusal. [[Pope Boniface VIII|Pope Boniface]] rescinded the requirement that physicians complete studies for the lower orders of the [[Catholic priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Juliann|last=Moen|title=Basic Healthcare Studies: Sexually Transmitted Disease|publisher=Alpha Editions|others=Lester Bivens|year=2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwU1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908204920/https://books.google.com/books?id=iwU1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all|isbn=9789386367570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval public health physicians in the employ of their cities were required to treat prostitutes infected with the "burning", as well as lepers and other epidemic victims.&lt;ref&gt;WE Leiky. History of European Morals. NY, MacMillan, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; After Pope Boniface completely secularized the practice of medicine, physicians were more willing to treat a sexually transmitted disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Juliann|last=Moen|title=Basic Healthcare Studies: Sexually Transmitted Disease|publisher=Alpha Editions|others=Lester Bivens|year=2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwU1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908204920/https://books.google.com/books?id=iwU1DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT70&amp;lpg=PT70|archivedate=8 September 2017|df=dmy-all|isbn=9789386367570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
A vaccine for gonorrhea has been developed that is effective in mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jerse|first1=AE|last2=Bash|first2=MC|last3=Russell|first3=MW|title=Vaccines against gonorrhea: current status and future challenges.|journal=Vaccine|date=20 March 2014|volume=32|issue=14|pages=1579–87|pmid=24016806|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2013.08.067|pmc=4682887}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will not be available for human use until further studies have demonstrated that it is both safe and effective in the human population.

After the bloom dies, the microbes which decompose the dead algae use up even more of the oxygen, which can create [[fish die-off]]s. When these zones of depleted oxygen cover a large area for an extended period of time, they are referred to as [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], where neither fish nor plants are able to survive.
 
HABs are induced by an [[nutrient pollution|overabundance of nutrients]] in the water. The two most common nutrients are fixed nitrogen (nitrates, ammonia, urea) and phosphate.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/habs/general.html Harmful Algal Blooms], ''Center for Disease Control''&lt;/ref&gt;  These nutrients are emitted by [[Agricultural pollution|agriculture]], other industries, excessive [[fertilizer]] use in urban/suburban areas and associated [[urban runoff]]. Higher water temperature and low circulation are contributing factors. HABs can cause significant harm to animals, the environment and economies. They have been increasing in size and frequency worldwide, a fact that many experts attribute to global climate change. The U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) predicts more harmful blooms in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harvey |first=Chelsea |date=2016-09-29 |title=The Pacific blob caused an "unprecedented" toxic algal bloom — and there’s more to come |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/09/29/warm-oceans-caused-last-years-toxic-blob-and-more-algae-blooms-may-be-in-store |work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description and identification==
[[File:Banter See 1348.jpg|thumb|px240|Algae on the coast of northern Germany]]
HABs from [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae) can appear as a foam, scum, or mat on or just below the surface of water and can take on various colors depending on their pigments.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt; Cyanobacteria blooms in freshwater lakes or rivers may appear bright green, often with surface streaks which looks like floating paint.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Similarly, red tides made up of dinoflagellates, also contain photosynthetic pigments that vary in color from green to brown to red.

Most blooms occur in warm waters that have excessive nutrients.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt; The harmful effects from such blooms is due to the toxins they produce or from using up oxygen in the water which can lead to fish die-offs.&lt;ref name=usatoday&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/08/07/algae-blooms-economy-west-coast-toxic-bloom/31222581/ "What you need to know about toxic algae blooms"], ''USA Today'', August 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all algal blooms are harmful, however, with some only discoloring water, producing a smelly odor, or adding a bad taste to the water. Unfortunately, it is not possible to tell if a bloom is harmful from just appearances, since sampling and microscopic examination is required.&lt;ref name=CDC/&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Blue-gree algae bloom Lake Erie.png|thumb|px240|Cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) bloom on [[Lake Erie]] in 2009]]
There are three main types of algae which can form into harmful algal blooms: [[cyanobacteria]], [[dinoflagellates]] and [[diatoms]]. All three are made up of microscopic floating organisms which, like plants, can create their own food from sunlight by means of [[photosynthesis]]. That ability makes them an essential part of the [[food web]] for small fish and other organisms.&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black, Jacquelyn G., and Black, Laura J. ''Microbiology: Principles and Explorations'', 8th Ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|246}}

===Cyanobacteria===
Harmful algal blooms in freshwater lakes and rivers, or at [[estuaries]], where rivers flow into the ocean, are caused by cyanobacteria, also known as "blue-green algae".&lt;ref name=Peebles&gt;Peebles, Ernst B. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/the-conversation-us/why-toxic-algae-blooms-li_b_11082734.html "Why toxic algae blooms like Florida’s are so dangerous to people and wildlife"], ''Huffington Post'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; They can produce hazardous toxins, such as [[microcystins]],&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; a [[neurotoxin]] which destroys nerve tissue of mammals.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; In high enough concentrations, water treatment plants may be unable to remove the toxin and will advise residents to avoid drinking tap water, as happened in Toledo, Ohio in August 2014.&lt;ref name=Toledo/&gt;

They also cause harm by blocking the sunlight or by using up the oxygen needed by fish or plant life, which can lead to fish die-offs.&lt;ref name="usatoday"/&gt;  When such oxygen-depleted water covers a large area for an extended period of time, it can become [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]], commonly called a [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zone]]. These dead zones can be the result of numerous different factors ranging from natural phenomenon to deliberate human interaction. These dead zones are not just limited to large bodies of fresh water as found in the great lakes, but are also prone to bodies of salt water as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/deadzone.html|title='Dead zone' is a more common term for hypoxia, which refers to a reduced level of oxygen in the water|last=Administration|first=US Department of Commerce, National Oceanic and Atmospheric|website=oceanservice.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=2017-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red tides===
[[File:La-Jolla-Red-Tide.780.jpg|thumb|px240|A red tide off the coast of [[San Diego, California]]]]
{{main|Red tide}}

The other types of algae are [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s, found primarily in marine environments, such as ocean coastlines or bays, where they can also form algal blooms, commonly called [[red tide]]s. Red tides, however, may be a natural phenomenon,&lt;ref name=Red&gt;[http://tpwd.texas.gov/landwater/water/environconcerns/hab/redtide/faq.phtml FAQs about red tides], Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department&lt;/ref&gt; although when they form close to coastlines or in estuaries. They can occur when warmer water, salinity, and nutrients reach certain levels, which then stimulates their growth.&lt;ref name=Red/&gt; Most red tide algae are dinoflagellates.&lt;ref name=monterey&gt;Ryan, John. [http://montereybay.noaa.gov/sac/2008/081508/081508ryan_ppt.pdf "Red Tide &amp; HAB Studies in Monterey Bay"], Monterey Bay Sanctuary Advisory Council Meeting, August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; They are visible in water at a concentration of 1,000 algae cells per milliliter, while in dense blooms they can measure over 200,000 per milliliter.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/09/150901144353.htm "Intense, widespread algal blooms reported in Chesapeake Bay"], ''Science Daily'', Sept. 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Diatoms produce [[domoic acid]], another neurotoxin, which can cause seizures in higher vertebrates and birds as it concentrates up the food chain.&lt;ref name=marine&gt;[http://www.marinemammalcenter.org/science/top-research-projects/domoic-acid-toxicity.html "Domoic Acid Toxicity"], ''The Marine Mammal Center''&lt;/ref&gt; Domoic acid readily accumulates in the bodies of [[shellfish]], [[sardines]], and [[anchovies]], which if then eaten by [[sea lions]], [[otters]], [[cetaceans]],  birds or people, can affect the nervous system causing serious injury or death.&lt;ref name=marine/&gt; In the summer of 2015, the state governments closed important shellfish fisheries in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]] and [[California]] because of high concentrations of domoic acid in shellfish.&lt;ref name=shellfish&gt;[https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/news/features/west_coast_algal_bloom/index.cfm "NOAA Fisheries mobilizes to gauge unprecedented West Coast toxic algal bloom"], Northwest Fisheries Science Center, June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Among the causes of algal blooms are:
* chemical wastes, primarily nutrients—[[phosphorus]] and [[nitrates]]—from fertilizers or human waste,&lt;ref name="EPA-Climate"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/climate-change-and-harmful-algal-blooms |title=Climate Change and Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-09 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peebles/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Amin |first=Md Nurul |last2=Kroeze |first2=Carolien |last3=Strokal |first3=Maryna |date=2017 |title=Human waste: An underestimated source of nutrient pollution in coastal seas of Bangladesh, India and Pakistan |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025326X17301595 |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1-2 |pages=131–140 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.045 |issn=0025-326X |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* climate change with its resultant [[global warming]],&lt;ref name="EPA-Climate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt;
* [[thermal pollution]] from power plants and factories, and
* low water levels in inland waterways and lakes, which reduces water flow and increases water temperatures.&lt;ref name=Utah&gt;[http://kutv.com/news/local/neurotoxic-algae-bloom-shuts-down-utah-lake "Neurotoxic algae bloom that shuts down Utah Lake can affect brain, liver"], ''KUTV'', July 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Russian&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/5741904-181/russian-river-to-be-closely?artslide=0 "Russian River to be closely monitored this summer to guard against harmful algae blooms"], ''Press Democrat'', June 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change, according to NOAA scientists, contributes to warmer waters which makes conditions more favorable for algae growth in more regions and farther north.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/algal-blooms-likely-to-flourish-as-temperatures-climb "Algal blooms 'likely to flourish as temperatures climb'"], ''Straits Times'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Global warming is also considered a key factor for algal blooms in the Southern hemisphere, acknowledged by scientists in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sentinelsource.com/features/environment/the-disgusting-uptick-in-the-incidence-of-algae-blooms/article_147ea74e-d028-5191-88e9-c21d02bb7f95.html "The disgusting uptick in the incidence of algae blooms"], ''Washington Post'', August 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In general, still, warm, shallow water, combined with high-nutrient conditions in lakes or rivers, increases the risk of harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Russian/&gt;

Nutrients enter freshwater or marine environments as [[surface runoff]] from [[agricultural pollution]] and [[urban runoff]] from fertilized lawns, golf courses and other landscaped properties; and from [[sewage treatment plants]] that lack nutrient control systems.&lt;ref name="EPA-sources"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/sources-and-solutions |title=Sources and Solutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-10 |website=Nutrient Pollution |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional nutrients are introduced from atmospheric pollution.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, G. Tyler Jr., ''Environmental Science'', Thomas Learning (2003) pp. 355{{endash}}357&lt;/ref&gt; Coastal areas worldwide, especially wetlands and estuaries, coral reefs and swamps, are prone to being overloaded with those nutrients.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; Most of the large cities along the [[Mediterranean Sea]], for example, discharge all of their sewage into the sea untreated.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; The same is true for most coastal developing countries.

===Examples===
====Texas==== 
Natural water reservoirs in [[Texas]] have been threatened by anthropogenic activities due to large petroleum refineries and oil wells (i.e. emission and wastewater discharge), massive agricultural activities (i.e. pesticide release) and mining extractions (i.e. toxic wastewater) as well as natural phe-nomena involving frequent HABs events. For the first time in 1985, the state of Texas documented the presence of the ''p. parvum'' (golden alga) bloom along the [[Pecos River]]. This phenomenon has affected 33 reservoirs in Texas along major river systems, including the Brazos, Canadian, Rio Grande, Colorado, and Red River, and has resulted in the death of more than 27 million fish and caused tens of millions of dollars in damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sharifan |first=Hamidreza |last2=Ma |first2=Xingmao |date=2017-08-31 |title=Potential Photochemical Interactions of UV Filter Molecules with Multichlorinated Structure of Prymnesins in Harmful Algal Bloom Events |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/152553/article |journal=Mini-Reviews in Organic Chemistry |volume=14 |issue=5 |doi=10.2174/1570193x14666170518124658}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chesapeake Bay====
[[File:July 12, 2013 - Sassafras River, VA Algal Bloom (9321804011).jpg|thumb|An algal bloom on the [[Sassafras River]], a tributary of the Chesapeake Bay]]
The [[Chesapeake Bay]], the largest [[estuary]] in the U.S., has suffered from repeated large algal blooms for decades due to chemical runoff from multiple sources,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-hs-algae-blooms-20150508-story.html "Scientists eye increase in harmful algae in Chesapeake"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', May 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; including 9 large rivers and 141 smaller streams and creeks in parts of six states. In addition, the water is quite shallow and only 1% of the waste entering it gets flushed into the ocean.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt;

By weight, 60% of the phosphates entering the bay in 2003 were from sewage treatment plants, while 60% of its nitrates came from fertilizer runoff, farm animal waste, and the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; About 300 million pounds (140 Gg) of nitrates are added to the bay each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/issues/dead-zones/nitrogen-phosphorus "Too Much Nitrogen and Phosphorus Are Bad for the Bay"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728141032/http://www.cbf.org/about-the-bay/issues/dead-zones/nitrogen-phosphorus |date=2016-07-28 }}, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The population increase in the bay [[drainage basin|watershed]], from 3.7 million people in 1940 to 18 million in 2015 is also a major factor,&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; as economic growth leads to the increased use of fertilizers and rising emissions of industrial waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/massive-nitrogen-pollution-accompanies-chinas-growth/ "Massive Nitrogen Pollution Accompanies China's Growth"], ''Scientific American'', Feb. 27, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://e360.yale.edu/feature/on_lake_taihu_china_moves_to_battle_massive_algae_blooms/2429/  "On Lake Taihu, China Moves To Battle Massive Algae Blooms"], ''Environment 360'', Yale University, July 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, the six states and the local governments in the Chesapeake watershed have upgraded their sewage treatment plants to control nutrient discharges. The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) estimates that sewage treatment plant improvements in the Chesapeake region between 1985 and 2015 have prevented the discharge of 900 million pounds (410 Gg) of nutrients, with nitrogen discharges reduced by 57% and phosphorus by 75%.&lt;ref name="EPA-Chesapeake Pollution"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/wastewater-pollution-reduction-chesapeake-bay-watershed |title=Wastewater Pollution Reduction in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-07-27 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural and urban runoff pollution continue to be major sources of nutrients in the bay, and efforts to manage those problems are continuing throughout the {{convert|64000|sqmi|km2}} watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/chesapeake-bay-tmdl/chesapeake-bay-tmdl-fact-sheet |title=Chesapeake Bay TMDL Fact Sheet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-09-29 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that harmful algal blooms are carried down the estuaries as water is released during the wet summer months. In July 2018 up to 90% of Lake Okeechobee was covered in algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/09/us/algae-blooms-florida-nyt.html|title=Algae bloom in florida prompts fears about harm to health and economy|last=Gomez|first=Melissa|date=9 July 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water draining from the lake filled the region with a noxious odor and caused respiratory problems in some humans during the following month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/harmful-algal-blooms-linger-parts-southern-florida-july-and-august-2018|title=Harmful algal blooms linger in parts of southern Florida in July and August 2018|last=Di Liberto|first=Tom|date=16 August 2018|website=NOAA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=30 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To make matters worse, harmful red tide blooms are historically common on Florida's coasts during these same summer months.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alcock|first=Frank|date=August 2007|title=An assessment of Florida red tide: causes, consequences, and management strategies.|url=https://dspace.mote.org/bitstream/2075/2911/1/Alcock-MPI_RedTide.pdf|journal=Mote Marine Technical Report|volume=1190|pages=|via=Mote Marine Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyanobacteria in the rivers die as they reach saltwater but their nitrogen fixation feeds the red tide on the coast.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Areas at the mouth of the estuaries such as [[Cape Coral, Florida|Cape Coral]] and [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] therefore experience the compounded effects of both types of harmful algal bloom.

====Coastal seas of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan====
[[Open defecation]] is common in south Asia, but human waste is an often overlooked source of nutrient pollution in marine pollution modeling. When nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) contributed by human waste was included in models for Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, the estimated N and P inputs to bodies of water increased one to two orders of magnitude compared to previous models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; River export of nutrients to coastal seas increases coastal [[eutrophication]] potential (ICEP). The ICEP of the [[Godavari River]] is three times higher when N and P inputs from human waste are included.

==Harmful effects==
As algal blooms grow, they deplete the oxygen in the water and block sunlight from reaching fish and plants. Such blooms can last from a few days to many months.&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt; With less light, plants beneath the bloom can die and fish can starve.Furthermore, the dense population of a bloom reduces oxygen saturation during the night by respiration.  And when the algae eventually die off, the microbes which decompose the dead algae use up even more oxygen, which in turn causes more fish to die or leave the area. When oxygen continues to be depleted by blooms it can lead to [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxic]] [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], where neither fish nor plants are able to survive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5891/926 "Spreading Dead Zones and Consequences for Marine Ecosystems"], ''Science'', August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These dead zones in the case of the Chesapeake Bay, where they are a normal occurrence, are also suspected of being a major source of [[methane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dietrich |first=Tamara |date=2016-07-19 |title=Study: Chesapeake Bay a bigger methane generator than previously thought |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/science/dp-nws-chesapeake-bay-methane-20160719-story.html |work=Daily Press |location=Newport News, VA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The negative impact on fish can be even more severe when they are confined to pens, as they are in fish farms. In 2007 a fish farm in [[British Columbia]] lost 260 tons of salmon as a result of blooms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmedanddangerous.org/salmon-farming-problems/environmental-impacts/algae-blooms/ Algae Blooms in fish farming], Farmed and Dangerous.org&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016 a farm in Chile lost 23 million salmon after an algal bloom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/03/10/3758642/chile-algal-bloom-salmon/ "One Of The U.S.’s Top Salmon Providers Just Lost Millions Of Salmon"], ''Climate Progress'', March 10, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to NOAA, less than one percent of algal blooms produce hazardous toxins, such as [[microcystins]].&lt;ref name=NOAA&gt;[http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/habharm.html "Are all algal blooms harmful?"], ''NOAA'', April 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Although blue-green or other algae do not usually pose a direct threat to health, the [[toxins]] (poisons) which they produce are considered dangerous to humans, land animals, sea mammals,  birds&lt;ref name=Utah2/&gt; and fish when the toxins are ingested.&lt;ref name=NOAA/&gt; The toxins are [[neurotoxins]] which destroy nerve tissue which can affect the nervous system, brain, and liver, and can lead to death.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Tests have shown some toxins near blooms can be in the air and thereby be inhaled, which could affect health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://weather.com/science/environment/news/florida-martin-county-algae-toxic-air-particles-marina-rio "Tests Reveal Florida's Toxic Algae is Threatening Not Only The Water Quality but Also the Air"], ''Weather.com'', July 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no treatment available for animals, including livestock cattle, if they drink from algal blooms where such toxins are present.

Agricultural officials in [[Utah]] worried that even crops could become contaminated if irrigated with toxic water, although they admit that they can't measure contamination accurately because of so many variables in farming. They issued warnings to residents, however, out of caution.&lt;ref name=KSL&gt;[https://www.ksl.com/?sid=40725118&amp;nid=148 "Effects of algal blooms continue to spread throughout Wasatch Front"], ''KSL TV'', July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drinking water====
[[File:Toxic Algae Bloom in Lake Erie.jpg|thumb|px240|Satellite image of Lake Erie during an algal bloom in 2011]]
Persons are generally warned not to enter or drink water from algal blooms, or let their pets swim in the water since many pets have died from algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Russian/&gt; In at least one case, people began getting sick before warnings were issued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgvtribune.com/environment-and-nature/20160718/people-got-sick-at-pyramid-lake-before-the-state-reported-toxic-algae-bloom-could-it-have-been-avoided "People got sick at Pyramid Lake before the state reported toxic algae bloom.

In some locations visitors have been warned not to even touch the water.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Boaters have been told that toxins in the water can be inhaled from the spray from wind or waves.&lt;ref name=Peebles/&gt;&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Ocean beaches,&lt;ref name=Florida/&gt; lakes&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; and rivers have been closed due to algal blooms.&lt;ref name=Utah2&gt;[http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/utah-county-portion-of-jordan-river-closed-due-to-toxic/article_3a5a7e25-504c-5821-b9c8-ce288f5c4e5e.html "Utah County portion of Jordan River closed due to toxic algal bloom"], ''Daily Herald'', July 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; After a dog died in 2015 from swimming in a bloom in California's [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]], officials likewise posted warnings for parts of the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/4425912-181/dog-dies-in-russian-river?artslide=0 "Dog dies on Russian River, tests positive for toxic algae"], Sept. 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Boiling the water at home before drinking does not remove the toxins.&lt;ref name=California/&gt;

Scientists in Britain, which has seen a huge increase in toxic algae, suspect that drinking water from sources that have blue-green algae may contribute to [[Alzheimer’s]], [[Parkinson’s]] or [[Lou Gehrig’s Disease]]. Few water treatment plants regularly test for [[cyanobacteria]]l toxins, however.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11438278/British-lakes-see-huge-rise-in-toxic-algae-linked-to-Alzheimers.html "Drinking water could be poisoned with toxic algae linked to Alzheimer’s"], ''The Telegraph'', Feb. 26, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 the city of [[Toledo, Ohio]] advised its 500,000 residents to not drink tap water as the high toxin level from an algal bloom in western [[Lake Erie]] had affected their water treatment plant's ability to treat the water to a safe level.&lt;ref name=Toledo&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/toxic-algae-bloom-leaves-500-000-without-drinking-water-in-ohio-1881940537.html "Toxic Algae Bloom Leaves 500,000 Without Drinking Water in Ohio"], ''Ecowatch'', August 3, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The emergency required using bottled water for all normal uses except showering, which seriously affected public services and commercial businesses.

In 2004, a bloom in Kisumu Bay, which is the drinking water source for 500,000 people in [[Kisumu]], [[Kenya]], suffered from similar water contamination.&lt;ref name=Circle&gt;[http://www.circleofblue.org/2014/world/draft-world-stands-algae-dead-zones-ruin-water/ "World Stands By As Algae and Dead Zones Ruin Water"], ''Circle of Blue'', Sept. 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In China, water was cut off to residents in 2007 due to an algal bloom in its third largest lake, which forced 2 million people to use bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/18959222/ns/world_news-world_environment/t/algae-smother-chinese-lake-millions-panic/#.V5fKbfkrLcs "Algae smother Chinese lake, millions panic"], NBC News, May 31, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahn |first=Joseph |date=2007-10-14 |title=In China, a Lake’s Champion Imperils Himself |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/14/world/asia/14china.html?_r=0 | work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A smaller water shut-down in China affected 15,000 residents two years later at a different location.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-08/08/content_11847923.htm "Algal bloom in Central China reservoir affects drinking water of 15,000"], ''Chinaview'', July 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Australia in 2016 also had to cut off water to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/bluegreen-algal-bloom-chokes-murray-cuts-water-to-farmers-20160308-gndihv.html "Blue-green algal bloom chokes Murray, cuts water to farmers"], ''The Age'', March 9, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan Steinman of [[Grand Valley State University]] has explained that among the major causes for the algal blooms in general, and Lake Erie specifically, is because blue-green algae thrive with high nutrients, along with warm and calm water. Lake Erie is more prone to blooms because it has a high nutrient level and is shallow, which causes it to warm up more quickly during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;Video interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2PsjhiZl2Q&amp;t=38s Dr. Alan Steinman on Algal Blooms in Lake Erie] 13 min.&lt;/ref&gt;

Symptoms from drinking toxic water can show up within a few hours after exposure. They can include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, or trigger headaches and gastrointestinal problems.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Although rare, liver toxicity can cause death.&lt;ref name=Utah/&gt; Those symptoms can then lead to dehydration, another major concern. In high concentrations, the toxins in the algal waters when simply touched can cause skin rashes, irritate the eyes, nose, mouth or throat.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; Those with suspected symptoms are told to call a doctor if symptoms persist or they can't hold down fluids after 24 hours.

===Economic impact===
====Recreation and tourism====
The hazards which accompany harmful algal blooms have hindered visitors' enjoyment of beaches and lakes in places in the U.S. such as Florida,&lt;ref name=Florida&gt;[http://wlrn.org/post/summer-heat-could-worsen-algae-blooms-florida-waters "Summer Heat Could Worsen Algae Blooms In Florida Waters"], ''WLRN'', July 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; California&lt;ref name=California&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-pyramid-lake-algae-bloom-20160714-snap-story.html "Summer conditions growing toxic algae blooms in two California lakes"], ''Los Angeles Times'', July 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Vermont,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.necn.com/news/new-england/Vt-Beaches-Reopen-After-Algae-Blooms-Clear-386953991.html "Vt. Beaches Reopen After Algae Blooms Clear"], ''NECN'', July 15, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and Utah.&lt;ref name="Utah2" /&gt; Persons hoping to enjoy their vacations or days off have been kept away to the detriment of local economies. Lakes and rivers in [[North Dakota]], [[Minnesota]], Utah, California and Ohio have had signs posted warning about the potential of health risk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.floridatoday.com/story/news/local/environment/2016/07/22/algae-blooming-waterways-all-around-country/87262178/ "Algae is blooming in waterways all around the country"], ''Florida Today'', July 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 [[Florida]] declared a [[state of emergency]] for four counties as a result of blooms. They were said to be "destroying" a number of businesses and affecting local economies, with many needing to shut down entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natureworldnews.com/articles/25512/20160719/look-florida-toxic-algae-choking-economy-environment.htm "How Florida's Toxic Algae is Choking the Economy And The Environment"], ''Nature World News'', July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Some beaches were closed, and hotels and restaurants suffered a drop in business. Tourist sporting activities such as fishing and boating were also affected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/florida-tourism-not-seeing-green-toxic-algae-chokes-business-n607106 "Florida Tourism Not Seeing Green as Toxic Algae Chokes Business"], ''NBC News'', July 11, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Florida2&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/05/toxic-algae-driving-away-florida-beachgoers.html "Toxic algae driving away Florida beachgoers"], ''CNBC'', July 5, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Marco Rubio]] called the situation in Florida "a health, ecological and economic emergency."&lt;ref name=Huffington&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/florida-algal-blooms_us_577d70cee4b0c590f7e7e3d2 "Toxic Algal Blooms Aren’t Just Florida’s Problem.

[[File:Negotiating algae one stroke at a time (15010363755).jpg|thumb|px240|Boaters in a freshwater algal bloom]]
Similar blooms have become more common in Europe, with France among the countries reporting them. In the summer of 2009, beaches in northern [[Brittany]] became covered by tonnes of potentially lethal rotting green algae. A horse being ridden along the beach collapsed and died from fumes given off by the rotting algae.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/aug/10/france-brittany-coast-seaweed-algae "Lethal algae take over beaches in northern France"], ''The Guardian'', U.K., August 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic damage resulting from lost business has become a serious concern. According to one report in 2016, the four main economic impacts from harmful algal blooms come from damage to human health, fisheries, tourism and recreation, and the cost of monitoring and management of area where blooms appear.&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt; EPA estimates that algal blooms impact 65 percent of the country's major estuaries, with an annual cost of $2.2 billion.&lt;ref name=KSL/&gt; In the U.S. there are an estimated 166 coastal dead zones.&lt;ref name=KSL/&gt; Because data collection has been more difficult and limited from sources outside the U.S., most of the estimates as of 2016 have been primarily for the U.S.&lt;ref name=JRC&gt;[https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/algal-bloom-and-its-economic-impact "Algal bloom and its economic impact"], ''European Commission Joint Research Centre'', 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In port cities in the [[Shandong Province]] of eastern China, residents are no longer surprised when massive algal blooms arrive each year and inundate beaches. Prior to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, over 10,000 people worked to clear 20,000 tons of dead algae from beaches.&lt;ref name=China&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/china-yellow-sea-turns-green-qingdao-beaches-are-covered-algae-photos-1509734 "China: Yellow Sea turns green as Qingdao beaches are covered in algae"], ''International Business Times'', July 7, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 another bloom in China, thought to be its largest ever,&lt;ref&gt;[http://phys.org/news/2013-07-china-largest-ever-algae-bloom.html "China hit by largest-ever algae bloom"], ''Phys.org'', July 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; covered an area of 7,500 square miles,&lt;ref name=China/&gt; and was followed by another in 2015 which blanketed an even greater 13,500 square miles. The blooms in China are thought to be caused by pollution from untreated agricultural and industrial discharges into rivers leading to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/china-has-an-algae-beach-pollution-problem-2015-7?r=UK&amp;IR=T "Slimy green algae is taking over China's beaches for an alarming reason"], ''Business Insider'', July 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fisheries industry====
[[File:NOAA Pacific coast 2015.jpg|thumb|px240|West coast algal bloom of 2015 which led to closing of fisheries]]
As early as 1976 a short-term, relatively small, dead zone off the coasts of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]] cost commercial and recreational fisheries over $500 million.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt; In 1998 a red tide in Hong Kong killed over $10 million in high-value fish.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

In 2009, the economic impact for the state of [[Washington (state)|Washington's]] coastal counties dependent on its fishing industry was estimated to be $22 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Miner |first=Colin |date=2009-11-27 |title=Assessing Algal Blooms’ Economic Impact |url=https://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/27/assessing-algal-blooms-economic-impact/ |work=New York Times |series=Green: Energy, the Environment and the Bottom Line (blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the U.S. seafood industry expected future lost revenue could amount to $900 million annually.&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt;

NOAA has provided a few cost estimates for various blooms over the past few years:&lt;ref name=NOAA3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaa.gov/what-is-harmful-algal-bloom |title=What is a harmful algal bloom? |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-04-27 |website= |publisher=U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; $10.3 million in 2011 due to the red tide at Texas oyster landings; $2.4 million lost income by tribal commerce from 2015 fishery closures in the pacific northwest; $40 million from Washington state's loss of tourism from the same fishery closure.

Along with damage to businesses, the toll from human sickness results in lost wages and damaged health. The costs of medical treatment, investigation by health agencies through water sampling and testing, and the posting of warning signs at effected locations is also costly.&lt;ref name=WHOI&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/fileserver.do?id=24159&amp;pt=10&amp;p=19132 "Estimated Annual Economic Impacts from Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in the United States"], Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The closures applied to areas where this algae bloom occurs has a big negative impact of the fishing industries, add to that the high fish mortality that follows, the increase in price due to the shortage of fish available and decrease in the demand for seafood due to the fear of contamination by toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Algae bloom and its economic impact |last=Sanseverino |first=Isabella |publisher=JRC publications |year=2016 |isbn=978-92-79-58101-4 |location=Europe |pages=23, 26, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes a big economic loss for the industry.

Economic costs are estimated to rise. In June 2015, for instance, the largest known toxic HAB forced the shutdown of the west coast shellfish industry, the first time that has ever happened. One Seattle NOAA expert commented, "This is unprecedented in terms of the extent and magnitude of this harmful algal bloom and the warm water conditions we're seeing offshore...."&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/06/west_coast_shellfish_industrie.html "Biggest-ever toxic algal bloom hits West Coast, shutting down shellfish industries"], ''Oregon Live'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The bloom covered a range from [[Santa Barbara, California]] northward to [[Alaska]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/news/toxic-algae-bloom-in-pacific-ocean-could-be-largest-ever/ "Toxic algae bloom in Pacific Ocean could be largest ever"], ''CBS News'', June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries have reported similar impacts, with cities such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil seeing major fish die-offs from blooms becoming a common occurrence.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;[http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/4/21/brazil-removes-50-tons-of-dead-fish-from-olympic-waters.html "Brazil removes 50 tons of dead fish from Olympic waters"], ''Aljazeera'', April 21, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2015, Rio collected an estimated 50 tons of dead fish from the lagoon where water events in the 2016 Olympics were planned to take place.&lt;ref name=Brazil/&gt;

The [[Monterey Bay]] has suffered from harmful algal blooms, most recently in 2015: "Periodic blooms of toxin-producing ''[[Pseudo-nitzschia]]'' diatoms have been documented for over 25 years in Monterey Bay and elsewhere along the U.S. west coast. During large blooms, the [[Bioaccumulation|toxin accumulates]] in shellfish and small fish such as anchovies and sardines that feed on algae, forcing the closure of some fisheries and poisoning marine mammals and birds that feed on contaminated fish."&lt;ref&gt;Tim Stephens, [http://news.ucsc.edu/2015/05/algal-bloom.html Large bloom of toxic algae under way in Monterey Bay and beyond], [[UC Santa Cruz]] (June 2, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Similar fish die-offs from toxic algae or lack of oxygen have been seen in Russia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fsobitie.com.ua%2Fnovosti%2Fv-kamenskom-mestnye-vlasti-nanyali-podryadchikov-ubirat-gory-mertvoy-ryby-s-plyazhey&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Kamensk local authorities have hired contractors to clean up mountains of dead fish from the beaches"], July 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Colombia,&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wradio.com.co%2Fnoticias%2Fregionales%2Freportan-mortandad-de-peces-en-los-palafitos%2F20160717%2Fnota%2F3191232.aspx&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Fish kills reported in the Palafitos"], W Radio, July 17, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Vietnam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/society/160721/thanh-hoa--locals-wear-masks-as-smell-from-dead-fish-overpowering.html "Thanh Hoa: Locals wear masks as smell from dead fish overpowering"], Vietnam.net, July 19, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; China,&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fjs.ifeng.com%2Fa%2F20160706%2F4725768_0.shtml&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Hongze Lake Suqian great, full of dead fish breeding area"], Modern Express Network, July 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Canada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/news/environment/tens-of-thousands-of-fish-dead-in-quebec-s-yamaska-river/article/469215 "Massive fish kill in Quebec's Yamaska River puzzle scientists"], ''Digital Journal'', July 4, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/scores-of-starfish-wash-ashore-in-turkeys-northwest.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=101009&amp;NewsCatID=341 "Scores of starfish wash ashore in Turkey’s northwest"], ''Hurriyet Daily News'', June 28, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radarcirebon.com/90-ton-ikan-waduk-darma-mati-masal-ini-penyebabnya.html "90 Tons of Fish Die Darma Masal"], Radar Cirebon, June 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.francetvinfo.fr%2Fmeteo%2Fmaine-et-loire-des-milliers-de-poissons-asphyxies-avec-la-decrue_1506061.html%23xtor%3DAL-67-&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url "Maine-et-Loire: Thousands of fish suffocated with the decline"], ''France TV'', June 18, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

====Land animal deaths====
Land animals, including livestock and pets have been affected. Dogs have died from the toxins after swimming in algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/02/02/3617937/california-algae-bloom/ "Unseasonal Toxic Algae Bloom In California Lake Kills Three Dogs"], ''Climate Progress'', Feb. 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Warnings have come from government agencies in the state of Ohio, which noted that many dogs and livestock deaths resulted from HAB exposure in the U.S. and other countries. They also noted in a 2003 report that during the previous 30 years, they have seen more frequent and longer-lasting harmful algal blooms."&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;[http://epa.ohio.gov/portals/35/inland_lakes/OhioVeterinaryAssociationArticle40910%20.pdf "Harmful Algal Blooms Can Be Deadly to Pets and Livestock"], ''Ohio Environmental Protection Agency''&lt;/ref&gt; In 50 countries and 27 states that year there were reports of human and animal illnesses linked to algal toxins.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt; In Australia, the department of agriculture warned farmers that the toxins from a HAB had the "potential to kill large numbers of livestock very quickly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://agriculture.vic.gov.au/agriculture/pests-diseases-and-weeds/animal-diseases/beef-and-dairy-cows/blue-green-algal-poisoning-of-stock "Blue-green algal poisoning of stock"], ''Agriculture Victoria''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dead whale NOAA.jpg|thumb|left|px240|Dead whale from an algal bloom]]
Marine mammals have also been seriously harmed, as over 50 percent of unusual marine mammal deaths are caused by harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/foundations/coastal_research/dead_whale_500.html |title=Over 50 percent of unusual marine mammal mortality events are caused by harmful algal blooms. |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2007-02-13 |website=Coastal Ecosystem Research |publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, over 65 [[bottlenose dolphins]] died during a red tide in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceanservice.noaa.gov/websites/retiredsites/sotc_pdf/hab.pdf |title=Harmful Algal Blooms |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2000-02-15 |website=State of the Coastal Environment |publisher=NOAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 a [[red tide]] in southwest Florida killed a record number of [[Manatee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accuweather.com/en/outdoor-articles/beach-marine/red-tide-algae-bloom-kills-rec/8049099 "Red Tide Algae Bloom Kills Record Number of Manatee"], ''Accuweather'', March 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Whales have also died in large numbers. During the period from 2005 to 2014, Argentina reported an average 65 baby whales dying which experts have linked to algal blooms. A whale expert there expects the whale population to be reduced significantly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecowatch.com/algal-blooms-linked-to-largest-die-off-of-great-whales-ever-recorded-1882115945.html "Algal Blooms Linked to Largest Die-Off of Great Whales Ever Recorded"], ''EcoWatch'', Oct. 29, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 off [[Cape Cod]] in the North Atlantic, at least 12 humbpack whales died from toxic algae from a red tide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2003/030804/full/news030804-1.html "Toxic algae suspected in whale death"], ''Nature'', August 4, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Alaska and British Columbia reported many [[humpback whales]] had likely died from HAB toxins, with 30 having washed ashore in Alaska. "Our leading theory at this point is that the harmful algal bloom has contributed to the deaths," said a NOAA spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigerian-news.com/30-dead-whales-wash-ashore-in-alaska-scientists-commence-investigations/ "30 Dead Whales Wash Ashore In Alaska; Scientists Commence Investigations"], ''Nigerian News'', August 24, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inverse.com/article/6223-toxic-algae-blooms-could-be-causing-whale-deaths "Toxic Algae Could Be Killing Dozens of Whales"], ''Inverse'', Sept. 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have died after eating dead fish contaminated with toxic algae. Rotting and decaying fish are eaten by birds such as [[pelicans]], [[seagulls]], [[cormorant]]s, and possibly marine or land mammals, which then become poisoned.&lt;ref name=WHOI-2/&gt; The nervous systems of dead birds were examined and had failed from the toxin's effect.&lt;ref name=KSBW/&gt; On the Oregon and Washington coast, a thousand [[scoter]]s, or sea ducks, were also killed in 2009. ""This is huge," said a University professor.&lt;ref name=Oregon2&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/news/index.ssf/2009/10/foam_from_ocean_algae_bloom_ki.html "Foam from ocean algae bloom killing thousands of birds"], ''Oregon Live'', October 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As dying or dead birds washed up on the shore, wildlife agencies went into "an emergency crisis mode."&lt;ref name=Oregon2/&gt;

It has even been suggested that harmful algal blooms are responsible for the deaths of animals found in fossil troves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gramling C. |year=2017 |title=Toxic algae may be culprit in mysterious dinosaur deaths |journal=Science |volume=357 |issue=6354 |page=857 |url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6354/857.1 |pmid=28860363 |doi=10.1126/science.357.6354.857-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====More dead zones====
[[File:Gulf dead zone.jpg|thumb|px240|Dead zone in the southern U.S.]]
According to NOAA, blooms can harm the environment even without producing toxins by depleting oxygen from the water when growing and while decaying after they die. Blooms can also block sunlight to organisms living beneath it. A record-breaking number and size of blooms have formed in the Pacific coast, in Lake Erie, in the Chesapeake Bay and in the Gulf of Mexico, where a number of dead zones were created as a result.&lt;ref name=Huffington/&gt; In the 1960s the number of dead zones worldwide was 49; the number rose to over 400 by 2008.&lt;ref name=SciAm2&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/oceanic-dead-zones-spread/ "Oceanic Dead Zones Continue to Spread"], ''Scientific American'', August 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. they are especially prevalent along the east and south coasts.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

Various important natural habitats such as rivers, lakes and [[estuaries]] have continued to degrade and has contributed to creating more oxygen-deprived [[dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]], including some in the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay, and Lake Erie.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/49347-lake-erie-dead-zone-drought.html "Lake Erie Dead Zone: Don't Blame the Slime!"], ''Live Science'', January 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Circle2&gt;Kozacek, Codi. [http://www.circleofblue.org/2016/united-states/algal-blooms-no-accident-florida-everglades-estuaries/ "Algal Blooms Are No Accident For Florida Everglades and Estuaries"], ''Circle of Blue'', July 20, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;	

Among the largest dead zones were those in northern Europe’s [[Baltic Sea]] and the Gulf of Mexico, which affects a $2.8 billion U.S. fish industry.&lt;ref name=Circle/&gt; Unfortunately, dead zones rarely recover and usually grow in size.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt; One of the few dead zones to ever recover was in the [[Black Sea]], which returned to normal fairly quickly after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the 1990s due to a resulting reduction in fertilizer use.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

==Potential remedies==
===Chemical treatment and dams===
Although a number of [[algaecide]]s have been effective in killing algae, they have been used mostly in small bodies of water. For large algal blooms, however, adding algaecides such as silver nitrate or copper sulfate can have worse effects, such as killing fish outright and harming other wildlife.&lt;ref name=Greensburg&gt;[http://www.greensburgdailynews.com/news/local_news/what-is-creeping-into-our-lakes/article_d77a16fa-ef97-5f5c-bb18-ae7b1acca0fa.html "What is creeping into our lakes?"], ''Greensburg Daily News'', August 16, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects can therefore be worse than letting the algae die off naturally.&lt;ref name=Greensburg/&gt;&lt;ref name=OSU/&gt;

Other experts have proposed building reservoirs to prevent the movement of algae downstream. However, that can lead to the growth of algae within the reservoir, which become sediment traps with a resultant buildup of nutrients.&lt;ref name=Greensburg/&gt; Some researchers found that intensive blooms in reservoirs were the primary source of toxic algae observed downstream, but the movement of algae has so far been less studied, although it is considered a likely cause of algae transport.&lt;ref name=OSU&gt;[http://oregonstate.edu/ua/ncs/archives/2015/jun/toxic-algal-blooms-behind-klamath-river-dams-create-health-risks-far-downstream "Toxic algal blooms behind Klamath River dams create health risks far downstream"], ''Oregon State University News'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrient-policy-data/control-and-treatment |title=Control and Treatment |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017-03-02 |website=Nutrient Policy and Data |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensors and monitoring devices===
A growing number of scientists agree that there is an urgent need to protect the public by being able to forecast harmful algal blooms.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"&gt;{{cite news |last=Richtel |first=Matt |date=2016-07-18 |title=A Dreaded Forecast for Our Times: Algae, and Lots of It |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/19/science/a-dreaded-forecast-for-our-times-algae-and-lots-of-it.html?_r=1 |work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; One way they hope to do that is with sophisticated sensors which can help warn about potential blooms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a206/ "Keeping Tabs on HABs: New Tools for Detecting, Monitoring, and Preventing Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', August 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The same types of sensors can also be used by water treatment facilities to help them prepare for higher toxic levels.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/122-a206/ "Keeping Tabs on HABs: New Tools for Detecting, Monitoring, and Preventing Harmful Algal Blooms"], ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The only sensors now in use are located in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2008 similar sensors in the Gulf forewarned of an increased level of toxins which led to a shutdown of shellfish harvesting in Texas along with a recall of mussels, clams and oysters, possibly saving many lives. With an increase in the size and frequency of HABs, experts state the need for significantly more sensors located around the country.&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt; The same kinds of sensors can also be used to detect threats to drinking water from intentional contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/homeland-security-research/water-system-security-and-resilience-homeland-security-research |title=Water System Security and Resilience in Homeland Security Research |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-12-20 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four U.S. federal agencies—EPA, the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), NOAA, and the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS)—are working on ways to detect and measure cyanobacteria blooms using satellite data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algaeindustrymagazine.com/us-agencies-creating-algal-bloom-early-warning-system/ "US agencies creating algal bloom early warning system"], ''Algae Industry Magazine'', April 8, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The data may help develop early-warning indicators of cyanobacteria blooms by monitoring both local and national coverage.&lt;ref name=satellite&gt;[http://toxics.usgs.gov/highlights/2015-12-21-cyanobacteria_sensing.html "Remote Sensing Provides a National View of Cyanobacteria Blooms"], USGS&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 automated early-warning monitoring systems were successfully tested, and for the first time proven to identify the rapid growth of algae and the subsequent depletion of oxygen in the water.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.news.virginia.edu/content/scientists-develop-early-warning-system-toxic-algae-blooms "Scientists Develop Early-Warning System for Toxic Algae Blooms"], ''UVA Today'', Univ. of Virginia, Jan. 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the U.S. at least, funding for such warning devices has been shrinking, with approved funding down 45% over the last five years.{{When|date=August 2018}} According to one marine science professor, "We need it more than ever, and we’ve brought ourselves to the precipice of making great forecasts, but we can’t make it happen."&lt;ref name="NYT-Richtel"/&gt;

===Reducing chemical runoff===
[[File:Runoff of soil &amp; fertilizer.jpg|thumb|px240|Soil and fertilizer runoff from a farm after heavy rains]]
The nitrates and phosphorus in fertilizers cause algal blooms when they run off into lakes and rivers after heavy rains. Modifications in farming methods have been suggested, such as only using fertilizer in a targeted way at the appropriate time exactly where it can do the most good for crops to reduce potential runoff.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; A method used successfully is [[drip irrigation]], which instead of widely dispersing fertilizers on fields, drip-irrigates plant roots through a network of tubes and emitters, leaving no traces of fertilizer to be washed away.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Seth M. ''Let There Be Water: Israel’s Solution for a Water-Starved World'', Macmillan (2015) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), drip irrigation also prevents the formation of algal blooms in [[reservoirs]] for drinking water&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecdobserver.org/news/fullstory.php/aid/4819/Israel:_Innovations_overcoming_water_scarcity.html "Israel: Innovations overcoming water scarcity"], ''OECD Observer'', April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; while saving up to 50% of water typically used by agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/jun/16/israel-drought-water-reclamation/ "How Israel survived its devastating drought"], ''San Diego Union-Tribune'', June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of states in the U.S. have tried eliminating [[phosphates in detergent]] and by cleaning{{Vague|date=September 2017}} water treatment plants, which succeeded in reducing the amount that entered Lake Erie by 66%.{{Failed verification|date=September 2017 |reason=No mention of 'cleaned' plants reducing phosphorus in cited article}} However, changes in farming practices during that period increased chemical runoff, thereby offsetting the improvements.&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;Biello, David. [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/deadly-algae-are-everywhere-thanks-to-agriculture/ "Deadly Algae Are Everywhere, Thanks to Agriculture"], ''Scientific American'', August 8, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been proposals to create buffer zones of foliage and wetlands to help filter out the phosphorus before it reaches water.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; Other experts have suggested using conservation tillage, changing crop rotations, and restoring wetlands.&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; "The most important thing that can be done is to reduce agricultural runoff," according to a Great Lakes pollution expert. "Prevention is better than treatment."&lt;ref name=SciAm/&gt; Another expert states that it is possible for some dead zones to shrink within a year under proper management.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

There have been a few success stories in controlling chemicals. After Norway's lobster fishery collapsed in 1986 due to low oxygen levels, for instance, the government in neighboring Denmark took action and reduced phosphorus output by 80 percent which brought oxygen levels closer to normal.&lt;ref name=Larsen&gt;Larsen, Janet. [http://www.earth-policy.org/plan_b_updates/2004/update41 "Dead Zones Increasing in the World's Coastal Waters"], Earth Policy Institute, June 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, dead zones in the [[Black Sea]] and along the [[Danube River]] recovered after phosphorus applications by farmers were reduced by 60%.&lt;ref name=Larsen/&gt;

===Research and management===

In 2008, the U.S. government prepared a report on the problem, "Harmful Algal Bloom Management and Response: Assessment and Plan".&lt;ref name=US&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/jsost_hab0908.pdf "Harmful Algal Bloom Management and Response: Assessment and Plan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510152427/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/jsost_hab0908.pdf |date=2013-05-10 }}, Office of Science and Technology Policy, Sept. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The change recognized the seriousness of the problem:
{{quote|It is widely believed that the frequency and geographic distribution of HABs have been increasing worldwide. All U.S. coastal states have experienced HABs over the last decade, and new species have emerged in some locations that were not previously known to cause problems. HAB frequency is also thought to be increasing in freshwater systems.&lt;ref name=US/&gt;}}
The report suggested among other remedies, using improved monitoring methods, trying to improve predictability, and testing new potential methods of controlling HABs.&lt;ref name=US/&gt; Some countries surrounding the Baltic Sea, which has the world's largest dead zone, have considered using massive geoengineering options, such as forcing air into bottom layers to aerate them.&lt;ref name=SciAm2/&gt;

In 2015, NOAA created 12 new research grants totaling nearly $2.1 million which they would award to national organizations doing research on harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, which they consider to be "two of the most scientifically complex and economically damaging coastal issues."&lt;ref name=NOAA4/&gt;

===Monitoring and reporting===
Most countries, states and large cities have departments which will help monitor and report incidents of algal blooms. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the U.S. launched the country's first algal bloom reporting system in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/a0622-algal-blooms.html "CDC launches first national reporting system for harmful algal blooms and associated illnesses"], CDC, June 22, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental agencies in individual U.S. states will accept reports of blooms from citizens and will work with cities to test and report incidents to the media.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4339">The '''Institute for Clinical and Economic Review''' (ICER) is a Boston-based independent nonprofit organization that seeks to improve healthcare value by providing comprehensive clinical and cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments, tests, and procedures.&lt;ref name=Pizzi2016&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=4822973 | pmid=27066190 | volume=9 | title=The Institute for Clinical and Economic Review and Its Growing Influence on the US Healthcare | journal=Am Health Drug Benefits | pages=9–10 | last1 = Pizzi | first1 = LT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded in about 2005 by physician-researcher [[Steven Pearson|Steven D. Pearson, MD, MSc, FRCP]].&lt;ref name=Pizzi2016/&gt; Until 2014 it concentrated on assessing health care costs (rather than evaluating drugs).&lt;ref name=Silverman2016/&gt; It evaluates the cost effectiveness of drugs in a similar way to the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence|UK's NICE]],&lt;ref name=Pizzi2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajpb.com/articles/institute-for-clinical-and-economic-review-seeks-to-enhance-healthcare-value Institute for Clinical and Economic Review Seeks to Enhance Healthcare Value.]&lt;/ref&gt; and has come under some criticism from the drug industry.&lt;ref name=Silverman2016/&gt; It has issued a number of drug evaluations since 2014.&lt;ref name=Silverman2016&gt;[https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/04/12/drug-prices-icer/ This nonprofit is playing a valuable role in framing the drug price discussion.

The institution is funded by the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, drug makers, insurers, and government grants.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.statnews.com/pharmalot/2016/04/12/drug-prices-icer/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threshold cost criteria==
ICER estimates the amount of money available to be spent annually on new drugs and then divides that amount by the number of expected US Food and Drug Administration approvals to set an affordability benchmark.&lt;ref name=Pizzi2016/&gt;

ICER's affordability calculations adjust for drugs targeting prevalent diseases and/or those presenting a significant clinical benefit by setting the threshold at double the available funds divided by the expected number of new drugs (approved by FDA).&lt;ref name=Pizzi2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Silverman2016/&gt;

After discussions in 2016 ICER broadened its quality-adjusted life year threshold to $50,000 - $150,000.&lt;ref name=FB-PI&gt;[http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/parp-drugs-from-az-clovis-and-tesaro-are-largely-overpriced-watchdog-says Cancer-fighting PARP drugs from AstraZeneca, Clovis and Tesaro largely overpriced, watchdog says. July 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drugs evaluated - reports issued==
It issued a draft report that said [[Sovaldi]] wasn’t worth the list price of about $84,000 a year.&lt;ref name=Silverman2016/&gt;

As of May 2016 ICER published final reports on

- Multiple myeloma
- Palliative care&lt;ref&gt;http://icer-review.org/materials/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{expand section|date=April 2016}} &lt;!-- eg see Pizzi refs --&gt;

It has criticised the high price of drugs for osteoporosis, multiple sclerosis, PCSK9 cholesterol meds, and immuno-oncology therapies.&lt;ref name=FB-PI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/are-new-bone-drugs-from-amgen-and-radius-cost-effective-not-even-close-icer-says Are new bone drugs from Amgen and Radius cost-effective? Not even close, ICER says. May 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 it issued a controversial draft report on [[PARP inhibitor]]s for ovarian cancer.&lt;ref name=FB-PI/&gt;

==Drug evaluations planned==
A preliminary list of drugs to be evaluated includes [[rociletinib]], [[AZD-9291]], [[necitumumab]], [[nivolumab]], and [[pembrolizumab]] for small-cell lung cancer; [[fingolimod]], [[dimethyl fumarate]], [[teriflunomide]], [[alemtuzumab]], and [[daclizumab]] for multiple sclerosis; and [[ixekizumab]] and [[brodalumab]] for psoriasis or [[psoriatic arthritis]].&lt;ref name=Pizzi2016/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6885">'''Interactive skeleton-driven simulation''' (or '''Interactive skeleton-driven dynamic deformations''') is a scientific [[computer simulation]] technique used to approximate realistic physical [[deformation (engineering)|deformation]]s of dynamic bodies in [[real-time computing|real-time]]. It involves using [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[mathematical optimization]]s to decide the body-shapes during motion and interaction with [[force]]s. It has various applications within realistic simulations for [[medicine]], 3D [[computer animation]] and [[virtual reality]].

==Background==
Methods for simulating deformation, such as changes of shapes, of dynamic bodies involve intensive calculations, and several models have been developed. Some of these are known as ''[[free-form deformation]]'', ''skeleton-driven deformation'', ''dynamic deformation'' and ''anatomical modelling''. [[Skeletal animation]] is well known in [[computer animation]] and 3D character simulation. Because of the calculation intensitivity of the simulation, few interactive systems are available which realistically can simulate dynamic bodies in [[real-time computing|real-time]]. Being able to ''interact'' with such a [[Realism (arts)|realistic]] 3D model would mean that calculations would have to be performed within the constraints of a [[frame rate]] which would be acceptable via a [[user interface]].

Recent research has been able to build on previously developed models and methods to provide sufficiently efficient and realistic simulations. The promise for this technique can be as widespread as [[mimic]]ing human [[facial expression]]s for [[face perception|perception]] of simulating a human actor in real-time or other [[cell (biology)|cell]] [[organism]]s. Using skeletal constraints and parameterized force to calculate deformations also has the benefit of matching how a single cell has a shaping [[skeleton]], as well as how a larger living organism might have an internal bone skeleton - such as the [[vertebrae]]s. The generalized external body force simulations makes [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] calculations more efficient, and means real-time [[interaction]]s are possible.

==Basic theory==
There are several components to such a simulation system:
*a [[polygon mesh]] defining the body shape of the model
*a coarse volumetric mesh using [[finite element method]]s to ensure complete integration over the model
*line constraints corresponding to internal skeleton and instrumented to the model
*[[linear]]izing of equations of motion to achieve interactive rates
*[[hierarchical]] regions of the mesh associated with skeletal lines
*blending of locally linearlized simulations
*a control lattice through [[Subdivision (graph theory)|subdivision]] fitting the model by surrounding and covering it
*a hierarchical basis containing functions which will provide values for deformation of each lattice
[[Domain of a function|domain]] with calculations of these hierarchical functions similar to that of [[lazy evaluation|lazy]] [[wavelet]]s

Rather than fitting the object to the skeleton, as is common, the skeleton is used to set constraints for deformation. Also the hierarchical basis means that detail levels can be introduced or removed when needed - for example, observing from a distance or hidden surfaces.

Pre-calculated [[pose]]s are used to be able to interpolate between shapes and achieve realistic deformations throughout motions. This means traditional [[keyframe]]s are avoided.

There are [[performance tuning]] similarities between this technique and [[procedural generation]], [[wavelet]] and [[data compression]] methods.

==Algorithmic considerations==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
To achieve interactivity there are several optimizations necessary which are implementation specific.

Start by defining the object you wish to animate as a set (i.e. define all the points):
&lt;math&gt;p : \Omega \times  \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^3 : (x, t) \mapsto p(x, t)&lt;/math&gt; .

Then get a handle on it.
Let &lt;math&gt;p_S : S \times \mathbb{R} \rightarrow  \mathbb{R}^3&lt;/math&gt;

Then you need to define the rest state of the object (the non-wobble point): 
&lt;math&gt;r(x) = \sum_{a} r_a \emptyset ^a (x) = r_a \emptyset ^a (x) = x&lt;/math&gt;

==Projects==
Projects are taking place to further develop this technique and presenting results to [[SIGGRAPH]], with available reference of details. Academic institutions and commercial enterprises like [[Alias Systems Corporation]] (the makers of the [[Maya (software)|Maya]] rendering software), [[Intel]] and [[Electronic Arts]] are among the known proponents of this work. There are also videos available showcasing the techniques, with editors showing interactivity in real-time with realistic results. The [[computer game]] [[spore (2008 video game)|Spore]] also has showcased similar techniques.

Though neither of his parents was musical, his extended family included many musicians, both amateurs and professionals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandolinmagazine.com “A Classical Approach — New Music for Mandolin” by Marilynn Mair, ''Mandolin Magazine,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405024124/http://www.mandolinmagazine.com/ |date=2001-04-05 }}'' Spring 2006, volume 7, number 4, pp. 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt; among them his cousin, concert pianist and composer [[Barbara Gallagher (pianist)|Barbara Gallagher]]. He began his formal musical training at age 10 studying [[violin]] under retired violinist and conductor, [[Robert Louis Barron]]. After graduating from [[Saks High School]] he studied violin and piano at [[Jacksonville State University]] before transferring to [[Lipscomb University]], where he earned his B.A. Craton studied theory and composition under [[John Maltese]], [[Gerald Moore (theory professor)|Gerald Moore]], and [[Henry Fusner]]. His graduate degree from [[Indiana University]] was in [[audiology]], and Craton practiced as a clinical audiologist for several years in [[Indiana]] before returning to his musical roots and devoting his full-time to teaching and composing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homesandlifestylesmagazine.com “Life in a Major Key” by Joel Pierson, ''H&amp;L,]'' June 2010, volume 6, number 5, pp. 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Craton's music is highly tonal and in general reflects a style of English pastoralism, often incorporating onomatopoeic elements sometimes described as "nature music."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnews.com/stories/2006/03/06/archive.484701.tms “John Craton, Composer,” by Carol Johnson, Bedford ''Times-Mail,''] March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His music has been variously characterized as "atmospheric,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destentor.nl/regio/zwolle “Het Consort is andere koek dan Jo met de banjo,” by Maarten Mestrom, ''De Stentor'' (Zwolle)], July 7, 2008, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; "dramatic and challenging,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnews.com/stories/2009/05/07/entertainment.nw-697244.tms ''“La Boîte à musique,'' by Sara Clifford, Bedford ''Times-Mail,''] May 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; "largely traditional ... playful,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandolinmagazine.com “A Classical Approach — New Music for Mandolin” by Marilynn Mair, ''Mandolin Magazine,''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010405024124/http://www.mandolinmagazine.com/ |date=2001-04-05 }} Spring 2006, volume 7, number 4, pp. 19-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally even reflecting "a medieval/Renaissance flavor."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operaamerica.org/Content/Archive/Publications/index.aspx ''“The Parliament of Fowls,”'' by Megan Young, ''Opera America''], Fall 2008, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; He has been performed by such artists and ensembles as [[Sebastiaan de Grebber]], [[Gertrud Weyhofen]], [[Eva van den Dool]], [[Christiaan Saris]], [[Ljubomir Velickovic]], [[Het CONSORT]], the [[Orkest van het Oosten]], [[Filarmonica Mandolini Alba Sapporo]], [[Townsend Opera Players]], and the [[Amsterdam Symphony Orchestra]]. Romanian opera composer and conductor [[Leonard Dumitriu]] has described Craton's music as "coming from some other time and planet," stating that although he "may be an American living in the present, ... [his] music comes from the time of [[Haydn]] and [[Mozart]], or, better, from a world without time, where ... even the cares are easy and bright ... a musical world of sonorous peace and joy." Many of Craton's works are published by [[Wolfhead Music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnews.com/stories/2008/05/29/entertainment.nw-078732.tms “New Classics,” by Mike Lewis, Bedford ''Times-Mail,''] May 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in his early years Craton often performed on [[violin]], [[piano]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and other instruments, he abandoned public performance after a hand injury and has since devoted himself completely to teaching and composing. He currently operates a private music studio in [[Bedford, Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmnews.com “European Debut,” by Carol Johnson, Bedford ''Times-Mail,''] March 7, 2006, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Knee [[arthritis]]''' is inflammation in the joints or area of the body where two bones come together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthriticassociation.org.uk/research/diet_arthritis_research_2 MHC report], The arthritis Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMHT0024677/|title=Arthritis - National Library of Medicine|last=pmhdev|website=PubMed Health|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joints are responsible for the movement of body parts. It is a condition that can be experienced all over the body or in a specific area. The types range from those related to wear and tear of [[cartilage]], such as [[osteoarthritis]] to those associated with [[inflammation]] resulting from an overactive [[immune system]], such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Arthritis Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment Information on MedicineNet.com"&gt;[http://www.medicinenet.com/arthritis/article.htm Arthritis Causes, Symptoms, Diagnosis and Treatment Information on MedicineNet.com], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nick-carrington.co.uk/treatment/knee-treatment/diseases-and-syndromes2/knee-arthritis |title=Knee Arthritis|publisher=North Yorkshire Orthopaedic Specialists|accessdate=15 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The one part of the body that is most affected by arthritis is the knee and it can suffer from both rheumatoid or osteoarthritis.

==Types==
===Rheumatoid arthritis===
{{Further | Rheumatoid arthritis}}

[[Rheumatoid arthritis]] (RA), is a chronic inflammatory disorder that most typically begins in the small joints in your [[hands]] and feet.&lt;ref name="Rheumatoid Arthritis - Mayoclinic.com"&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/rheumatoid-arthritis/DS00020 Rheumatoid Arthritis - Mayoclinic.com], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the course can begin with other nonspecific symptoms, such as tiredness.   After attacking the smaller joints of the body, RA often progresses into larger joints, such as the shoulders, elbows, hips, and knees. Symptoms include joint pain, swelling, red and puffy hands, and fatigue. RA degrades the lining of the joints and causes swelling that is painful and can lead to joint deformity in the affected joints.  [[Rheumatoid arthritis]] tends to worsen over time.  Though there is no permanent cure, the course of the disease can be modified so that the damage is less, the patient is more comfortable and the patient can continue to engage in and enjoy daily activities.  Treatment is most effective when it is begun as early as possible, before the process of deformity is far progressed, but some relief can be offered by treatment at any stage.

===Osteoarthritis===
{{Further | Osteoarthritis}}

[[Osteoarthritis]] is a joint disease that causes the cushion layer between one's bones, or cartilage to wear away. It is also called degenerative joint disease.&lt;ref name="Osteoarthritis of the knee - familydoctor.org"&gt;[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/pain/disorders/616.html Osteoarthritis of the knee - familydoctor.org], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms are similar to RA and develop in the same slow manner. They include pain, tenderness in the knee, stiffness when standing or walking, loss of flexibility, and grating sensations that can be heard when the [[knee joint]] is used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arthritisknee.net/osteoarthritis.php What is Osteoarthritis] Retrieved on 2010-02-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Osteoarthritis in the knee begins with the gradual deterioration of cartilage. Without the protective cartilage, the bones begin to rub together, causing pain, loss of mobility, and deformity.&lt;ref name="How Osteoarthritis Affects Your Knee - WebMD.com"&gt;[http://www.webmd.com/osteoarthritis/healthtool-osteoarthritis-affects-your-knee How Osteoarthritis Affects Your Knee - WebMD.com], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It affects approximately 16 million people. The majority of arthritis cases involving the knee are osteoarthritic cases.

==Causes==
It is not always certain why arthritis of the knee develops. Most physicians believe that it is a combination of factors that can include [[muscle weakness]], [[obesity]], heredity, joint injury or stress, constant exposure to the cold, and aging. Cartilage in the knee begins to break down and leaves the bones of the knee rubbing against each other as you walk. Persons who work in a place that applies repetitive stress on the knees are at a high risk of developing this condition. Bone deformities increase the risk for osteoarthritis of the knee since the joints are already malformed and may contain defective cartilage. Having [[gout]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Paget's disease of bone|Paget's disease]] of bone or [[septic arthritis]] can increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis.&lt;ref name="Osteoarthritis: Risk Factors - MayoClinic.com"&gt;[http://mayoclinic.com/health/osteoarthritis/DS00019/DSECTION=risk-factors Osteoarthritis: Risk Factors - MayoClinic.com], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some physicians and most podiatrist believe that Pes Planus (flat feet) cause increased rates and earlier incidence of knee osteoarthritis.  In a study{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} of army recruits with moderate to severe flat feet, the results showed that they had almost double the rate of knee arthritis when compared to recruits with normal arches.
==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis depends on a focused medical history and on a physical examination of the affected knee. In particular, a history of persistent knee pain, limited (low) morning stiffness and reduced function in addition to physical exam findings of crepitus (feeling of cracking or popping with movement of the joint), restricted movement and bony enlargement were found to be the most useful diagnostics markers in one study.&lt;ref name="pmid19762361"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Zhang W, Doherty M, Peat G, Bierma-Zeinstra MA, Arden NK, Bresnihan B et al.| title=EULAR evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. | journal=Ann Rheum Dis | year= 2010 | volume= 69 | issue= 3 | pages= 483–9 | pmid=19762361 | doi=10.1136/ard.2009.113100 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19762361  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Standardized medical questionnaires like the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orthotoolkit.com/index.php/koos/ |title=KOOS survey score description and calculator – orthotoolkit |format= |website= |accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and short form KOOS JR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orthotoolkit.com/index.php/koos-jr/ |title=KOOS Jr. survey score description and calculator – orthotoolkit |format= |website= |accessdate=January 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Knee Injury and Osteopaedic Outcome Score (WOMAC)&lt;ref name="pmid11642645"&gt;{{cite journal| author=McConnell S, Kolopack P, Davis AM| title=The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC): a review of its utility and measurement properties. | journal=Arthritis Rheum | year= 2001 | volume= 45 | issue= 5 | pages= 453–61 | pmid=11642645 | doi= | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=11642645  }}&lt;/ref&gt; can also be used to diagnose and monitor progression of knee osteoarthritis.

==Treatment==
Depending on the level of pain and damage suffered by a patient, a physician will recommend a treatment regimen that will relieve symptoms. Some of the most common recommendations include avoiding activities that make the pain worse, ice the knee for 20 to 30 minutes throughout the day to reduce inflammation, use over the counter [[anti-inflammatory medication]]s, paracetamol (acetaminophen) and physical therapy.

Topical creams and patches can also be used for pain treatment and they have been proven to reduce pain by 33 to 57%.

Exercises can help increase range of motion and flexibility as well as help strengthen the muscles in the leg. [[Physical therapy]] and exercise are often effective in reducing pain and improving function.&lt;ref name="Arthritis of the Knee - American Academy of Orthopaetic Surgeons"&gt;[http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00212 Arthritis of the Knee - American Academy of Orthopaetic Surgeons], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with a physical therapist to find exercises that promote function without risking further injury is effective for most patients. Many of the exercises used can be performed while sitting in a chair or standing in place. They are performed so that additional stress or weight is not placed on the knee joint. Water exercises are highly recommended along with the use of elastic bands.  

A Cochrane review could not conclude whether high-intensity exercises provide better results than low-intensity exercises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Regnaux|first=Jean-Philippe|last2=Lefevre-Colau|first2=Marie-Martine|last3=Trinquart|first3=Ludovic|last4=Nguyen|first4=Christelle|last5=Boutron|first5=Isabelle|last6=Brosseau|first6=Lucie|last7=Ravaud|first7=Philippe|date=2015-10-29|title=High-intensity versus low-intensity physical activity or exercise in people with hip or knee osteoarthritis|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=10|pages=CD010203|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010203.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=26513223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supportive devices like knee braces can be used. In most cases, the arthritis is centered on a single side of the knee, so braces are effective in providing stability to one side. Two different forms of braces are available. A support brace provides the aid the entire knee requires, where an up-loader brace shifts the pressure away from the specific part of the knee that is experiencing the pain. Shoes or inserts that are considered to be energy absorbing are found useful for some patients as well as walking devices like a cane.  Shoe insoles that are  fitted to correct flat feet have provided relief to many patients.

The use of oral steroids and anti-inflammatory medicines help to reduce the amount of inflammation and pain felt in the knee. If over the counter medicines like [[ibuprofen]] or [[naproxen]] are not strong enough, prescription strength medicines are used. If oral medicine and physical therapy don't help your knee enough, doctors may consider giving patients injections with pain medicine.&lt;ref name="Osteoarthritis of the Knee: Treatment - Familydoctor.org"&gt;[http://familydoctor.org/online/famdocen/home/common/pain/disorders/616.html Osteoarthritis of the Knee: Treatment - Familydoctor.org], Retrieved on 2010-01-22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyaluronic acid]] is present in the knee, but injections of it can be used to protect the joint when the cartilage becomes thinner and can't do it alone. These injections can provide more pain relief than oral medications lasting from six months to a year.

Surgery is the final option but may be required to relieve symptoms. [[Arthroscopy]] is performed through tiny cuts where damaged parts of the knee can be removed. [[Osteotomy]] is performed to reshape the bones in the knee and is only performed if one side of the knee is damaged. [[Arthroplasty]] is a replacement surgery where an artificial joint is used.

[[Low level laser therapy]] can be considered for relief of pain and stiffness associated with osteoarthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brosseau, L., Welch, V., Wells, G., Tugwell, P., de Bie, R., Gam, A., Morin, M. | title = Low level laser therapy for osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis: a meta-analysis | journal = The Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 1961–1969 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10955339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary Ellen Britton''' (1855–1925) was an [[African-American]] [[physician]], [[Teacher|educator]], [[Women's suffrage|suffragist]], [[journalist]] and [[civil rights]] activist from [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Britton was an original member of the Kentucky Negro Education Association, which formed in 1877. She was president of the Lexington Woman's Improvement Club, and later served as a charter member of the Ladies Orphan Society which founded the Colored Orphan Industrial Home in Lexington, in 1892. During her lifetime she accomplished many things through the obstacles she faced. After teaching black children in Lexington public schools, she worked as a doctor from her home in Lexington. She specialized in [[hydrotherapy]], [[electrotherapy]] and massage; and, she was officially granted her license to practice medicine in [[Lexington, Kentucky]] in 1902, making her the first woman doctor to be licensed in Lexington.

==Background and early life==
{{Seventh-day Adventism}}
Mary Ellen Britton was born as [[Free people of color|a free person of color]] on April 16, 1855. She was one of seven children of Laura and Henry Britton who lived on Mill Street, somewhere between Second and Third Streets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lexington 1859-60 City Directory | place = Lexington, Kentucky | publisher = Hitchcock and Searles | date= 1859}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now in the Gratz Park Historical District of [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. Contrary to the limited opportunities many other African-Americans of the time were allowed, she and her siblings—Susan J. (born 1850), [[Julia Britton Hooks|Julia]] (born 1852), Mary Elizabeth (born 1855), Joseph (also known as Josiah, born 1856), Robert H. (born 1857), Martha (born 1860), William (born 1867) and Hattie (born 1868), Lucy (born ca. 1872), and Thomas Marshall (born 1873) — all acquired a classical education.&lt;ref name="McDaniel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDaniel|first1=Karen Cotton|title=Mary Ellen Britton: A Potent Agent for Public Reform|journal=The Griot: the Journal of African American Studies|date=Spring 2013|volume=32|issue=1|pages=52–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father Henry was a freeborn carpenter (born around 1824) of Spanish/Indian heritage who later became a barber in Berea. Her mother, Laura, was a gifted singer and musician who had been well-educated under the protection of her mother who was an enslaved mistress to Kentucky statesman [[Thomas F. Marshall]]. Laura had been emancipated at the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name="Byars"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | first = Lauretta Flynn | last = Byars | title = Mary Elizabeth Britton (1858 - 1925) | encyclopedia = Notable Black American Women, Book II | editor-first = Jessie Carney | editor-last = Smith | publisher = Gale Research Inc. | place = Detroit, MI | pages = 55–56 | date = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a young age Britton was offered the best education possible for African American children in that time - attending private schools created out of subscriptions from Lexington's African-American professional class. In 1859, along with older sister [[Julia Britton Hooks]] (later known as a gifted musician and educator, as well as Berea's first African American teacher), Britton attended a branch school in Lexington started by Mr. William H. Gibson of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;See more about Gibson's public career in Louisville and the branch schools he opened in 1859 in Lexington and Frankfort, p. 69: {{cite book|author=William H. Gibson|title=History of the United brothers of friendship and Sisters of the mysterious ten: in two parts ; a Negro order ; organized August 1, 1861, in the city of Louisville, Ky|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2lMMAQAAMAAJ|year=1897|publisher=Printed by the Bradley &amp; Gilbert company}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family later moved to [[Berea, Kentucky]] where Laura Britton was hired as a matron at Berea College.&lt;ref name="Byars" /&gt;

From 1871 to 1874, Mary E. Britton attended [[Berea College]], the first institution of higher learning to admit blacks in the state of Kentucky. At the time the only profession offered to an educated woman of any race was teaching. While she was there as a student, she was also a part of the faculty teaching instrumental music - making her the first African-American to teach white students at Berea.&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt; After the death of both her parents (within four months of each other in 1874),&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt; Britton left Berea in order to seek employment. She taught in the Lexington School System beginning around 1876&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in Kentucky-Health/Medicine|url=http://www.womeninkentucky.com/site/healthmed/M_Britton.html|publisher=womeninkentucky.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022181143/http://www.womeninkentucky.com/site/healthmed/M_Britton.html|archivedate=2013-10-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ending in August 1897.

==Professional career==
After leaving Berea, Britton taught in several schools in central Kentucky and advocated for the improvement of pedagogy in African-American schools. Her paper entitled "Literary Culture of the Teacher" was presented at the second meeting of the Kentucky Negro Education Association (KNEA) in Louisville in 1879. At the Ninth Annual Convention of the KNEA in Danville, she gave two speeches, the second of which (on July 6, 1887), she spoke out on behalf of woman suffrage. In her speech, which later was published as "Woman's Suffrage: A Potent Agency in Public Reform," she argued that women, like men, had a right to define their own fate within the laws of the land, and that laws should be equally applied to both women and men.&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt; She wrote: "If woman is the same as man then she has the same rights, if she is distinct from man then she has a right to the ballot to help make laws for her government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Britton|first1=Mary E.|title=Woman's Suffrage: A Potent Agency in Public Reforms|work=The American Catholic Tribune|date=July 22, 1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 she presented "History and Science of Teaching" before the American Association of Educators of Colored Youth in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;ref name="Byars" /&gt;

On April 15, 1892, Britton presented a speech to the joint Railroad Committee of the Kentucky General Assembly on behalf of a delegation of women protesting the Separate Coach bill. In her speech she questioned the white supremacists' assumptions about their monopoly on virtue, intelligence and aestheticism - reminding the legislators of the horrors of slavery and atrocities by whites that were allowed. She also decried the segregationist approach of punishing a whole group of people simply because of their shared color of skin when only one African-American was convicted and punished for a crime committed. Britton argued on behalf of all Americans and their right to "life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" concluding that a law based solely on race was unjust and un-American.&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;

That same year, Britton and 19 other women met at St. Paul A.M.E. Church to establish the Ladies Orphans' Home Society. This group raised the money and created the [[Colored Orphan Industrial Home]] in Lexington, Kentucky. This organization provided food, shelter, education and training to destitute orphans and elderly, homeless women until it closed in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Lauretta Flynn | last = Byars | title = Lexington's Colored Orphan Industrial Home: Building for the Future | place = Lexington, Kentucky | publisher = I.B. Bold Publications | date= 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Britton tested whether the grand "White City" in Chicago for the [[World's Columbian Exposition of 1893]] was open to blacks. African-American participation in the exhibits had been very limited, leading to calls for protests. According to Karen Cotton McDaniel, Britton was curious if the Kentucky building in the Exposition would allow her entrance. Her open defiance of white supremacy at the door of the Kentucky exhibit—and subsequent "humiliation, indignation and other strains she experienced" was highly publicized.&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;

She resigned from teaching to work at the [[Battle Creek Sanitarium]] in Michigan where she learned about [[hydrotherapy]], [[phototherapy]], [[thermotherapy]], [[electrotherapy]] and [[mechanotherapy]]—the strategies and health principles advocated by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]. She attended classes there with the [[American Medical Missionary College]] and took classes in Chicago, graduating in 1903. She returned home and became the first African-American woman licensed to practice medicine in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].&lt;ref name="Byars" /&gt; After about a year, she built an office on North Limestone Street (fronting Rand Avenue) where she practiced for over twenty years.

==Other accomplishments and attributions==
Britton was an original member of the Kentucky Negro Education Association which was formed in 1877 to improve schools for African-American children and to make statewide changes through legislative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Kentucky Negro Educational Association (KNEA) | website = Notable Kentucky African Americans Database | publisher = University of Kentucky Libraries | url = http://nkaa.uky.edu/record.php?note_id=410 |accessdate = 3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also President of the Lexington Woman's Improvement Club. The initial goal for this club was the "elevation of women, the enriching and betterment of home, and the encitement of proper pride and interest in race."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = W.D. | last = Johnson | title = Biographical Sketches of Prominent Negro Men and Women of Kentucky | place = Lexington, Kentucky | publisher = The Standard Print | date = 1897 | pages = 18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the Club managed a Day Nursery for the children of working mothers.

Her writings on moral and social reform can be found in local newspapers such as the ''Lexington American Citizen'' and the ''Lexington Daily Transcript''—she wrote a regular women's column in the ''Lexington Herald'' (signed "Meb"). She also wrote for the ''Cleveland Gazette'', the ''Indianapolis World'', the Baltimore ''Ivy'' and the ''American Catholic Tribune'' in Cincinnati.&lt;ref name="Byars" /&gt;

==Death==
Dr. Britton never married or had children. Most of her siblings died before her, most at an early age. Martha and Joseph died in childhood sometime after 1860; Hattie shot herself in the head at the age of 23 while living with sister [[Julia Britton Hooks|Julia]] in Memphis. Thomas, her youngest brother, went on to become a successful jockey, but in 1901 at the age of 28 and banned from many racetracks he committed suicide by drinking carbolic acid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nkaa.uky.edu/record.php?note_id=2626 Britton, Thomas M., Sr. "Tom"] Notable Kentucky African Americans Database&lt;/ref&gt; Lucy had married Will F. "Monk" Overton (a jockey whose career was also overturned by Jim Crow), but died in her early thirties from acute nephritis.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=B5SQAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA302&amp;ots=aQ7BTiVDAd&amp;dq=monk%20overton%20jockey&amp;pg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q=monk%20overton&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000464.htm Interstitial nephritis] Medline Plus&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914 the eldest sister, Susan who was the wife of a prominent African-American barber in Lexington named Benjamin Franklin, died. Dr. Britton retired from her medical practice at the age of 68 in 1923.&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;

Mary E. Britton died in Lexington's St. Joseph Hospital on August 27, 1925, only a few hours after she had been admitted. The Blue Grass Medical Society published a proclamation in the ''Lexington Leader'' (August 30, 1925) describing their esteem for her work and character. The funeral was held at her home/office on North Limestone and she was buried in Lexington's segregated Greenwood Cemetery (now known as Cove Haven).&lt;ref name="McDaniel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=cr&amp;CRid=1802031&lt;/ref&gt; She willed most of her estate to her sister [[Julia Britton Hooks]] and Julia's sons, and she gave her library to the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref name="Byars" /&gt;

In '''periodontics''', there are four reasons to seek medication. Those four reasons include infection, swelling, pain, and sedation. Although some patients may experience pain, swelling, and infection as a result of an acute periodontal problem such as advanced periodontal disease, periodontic patients usually do not need medication until they are faced with surgery. For successful surgery, medication is then introduced prior to the operation, usually the morning before the procedure and is continued for up to two weeks after.

==Conscious sedation in dentistry==
During the surgery, dentists use medication to not only ease the pain of the procedure, but also to reduce patient anxiety. With [[conscious sedation]], you remain comfortable and pain-free. The term "medication dentistry" is also referred to as anxiety-free dentistry, relaxation dentistry or comfortable dentistry. This is because most of the patients have feelings of anxiety during even a routine trip to the dentist’s office.

There are a number of [[sedation]] drugs, which can be taken by mouth. They have been developed specifically for the purpose of conscious sedation in dentistry. Sleep dentistry is a common term once used to describe a visit to the dentist. The interesting thing is that though it was referred to as sleep dentistry, the patient never actually went to sleep during the visit. Sleep dentistry should really be applied to dentistry which uses the aid of general anesthesia. 
The dentist will determine which medication is best used during sedation.

===Diazepam===
This is probably the most well recognized drug used today. [[Diazepam]] (Valium) has been used since the 1960s. It is a well-known sedative. It is extremely useful during appointments where the most extensive dentistry is being performed.

===Triazolam===
[[Triazolam]] (Halcion) is the most well-known treatment for insomnia. It is a highly effective drug, which can be used in conjunction with an antihistamine. It is similar to diazepam and is a popular choice for many different dentists. Triazolamis typically used for shorter appointments.

===Zaleplon===
[[Zaleplon]] (Sonata) is also used in the treatment of insomnia. The patient is not in an extended sleep during throughout oral sedation, but is rather relaxed and comfortable throughout the procedure.

===Lorazepam===
Lorazepam (Ativan) is a very commonly prescribed drug for anxiety. It is very useful in appointments that are longer than two hours.

===Hydroxyzine===
[[Hydroxyzine]] (Vistaril) is classified as an antihistamine. It has anti-anxiety effects and works in conjunction with many benzodiazepines. It has no amnesic properties.

===Midazolam===
Midazolam the shortest half-life of any available drugs. It is ideal for short appointments and simple procedures. It has many anti-anxiety properties as well as amnesic properties.

==General medication information==
Medications are typically used to control pain and anxiety in dentistry. The patient is very rarely out completely during a dental procedure, even if he or she cannot accurately remember the procedure upon waking up.

==Anti-inflammatory==
Anti-inflammatory medications are used to relieve discomfort and redness of the mouth and gums. They are available by prescription only and are available as pastes under some brand names such as Kenalog and Orabase. There are also non-prescription anti-inflammatory medications, such as Motrin, which may be used to relieve pain and are available over-the-counter.

==Anesthesia==
Local anesthesia, general anesthesia, nitrous oxide and intravenous sedation are all used during common procedures to help dull and control pain and anxiety.

Topical anesthetic agents are typically intraorally to control pain or irritation caused by toothache, teething, or sores in or around the mouth. Topical anesthetics are available by prescription or over-the-counter. They are available in sprays, dental paste, dental gels, lozenges, ointments and solutions. Anbesol, Chloraseptic, Orajel and Xylocaine are examples of available anesthetics over-the-counter. Some medications are also given in order to control plaque and gingivitis. This type of medication is typically available in a mouthwash.

==Antiseptics==
[[Antiseptic]]s may be recommended (over-the-counter) by the dentist to help reduce plaque and gingivitis buildup, as well as kill germs, which may be the cause of bad breath.

Knowing the role of supragingival plaque in the initiation of periodontal disease and insufficient control of the plate, the use of antiseptics is warranted. These anti-plaque derived from different chemical classes and have different mechanisms of action.

==Other medications==
There are also many medications, which are used to treat tooth decay. Fluoride is used to prevent tooth decay in individuals. Fluoride is available in non-prescription form and is available in many different types of toothpaste.

Muscle relaxants and antifungal medication is also sometimes prescribed within dentistry. Muscle relaxants may be prescribed in order to reduce the patient’s stress levels and/or to help the patient discontinue grinding their teeth. It can also be used to treat TMJ disorders.

Antifungal medication may be used to treat oral thrush, which is common in infants. The goal of treatment is stop the spreading of the Candida fungal infection.

Bothies sometimes have an outside toilet but the majority do not. When this is not the case a toilet spade and guidance as to the appropriate disposal of toilet waste are provided within the bothy. Raised platforms or bunks may have been installed for sleeping, but this is not always the case. The floor, particularly an attic floor, may also be suitable to sleep on with the aid of a [[sleeping pad]]. Visitors are expected to stay for no more than a night or two before moving on.&lt;ref name=bothyuse&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountain Bothies Association - Using a Bothy|url=https://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/bothies/using-a-bothy/|website=www.mountainbothies.org.uk|publisher=Mountain Bothies Association|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groups of six or more and commercial groups are not allowed.&lt;ref name=mbacode&gt;{{cite web|title=Mountain Bothies Association UK - bothy and shelters, Bothy Code|url=http://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/bothy-code.asp|website=www.mountainbothies.org.uk|publisher=Mountain Bothies Association|accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The MBA was founded by Bernard Heath in 1965.&lt;ref name="Herald 50 years"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/life_style/14447401.Basic_but_brilliant_-_Scotland_s_bothy_bounty/ |title=Basic but brilliant - Scotland's bothy bounty |first=Colin |last=Hutchison |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |date=23 April 2016 |accessdate=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inspired by a comment by Alan Murdock in the visitors' book at Backhill of Bush. He first organised the restoration that summer of the ruined farmhouse at Tunskeen as an unlocked shelter, and then with Alan called the meeting on 28 December 1965 at which the MBA was formed,   "To maintain simple unlocked shelters in remote mountain country for the use of hillwalkers, climbers and other genuine outdoor enthusiasts who love the wild and lonely places".&lt;ref&gt;Press release by Bernard Heath and Alan Murdock, October 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 the MBA became a registered charity.&lt;ref name=oscr&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of The Scottish Charity Regulator - Charity Details|url=https://www.oscr.org.uk/search/charity-details?number=SC008685#results|website=www.oscr.org.uk|publisher=OSCR|accessdate=17 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the Association was incorporated as a [[company limited by guarantee]], still remaining a registered charity.

{{As of|2016|4}}, the MBA had a membership of around 3,700.&lt;ref name="Herald 50 years"/&gt; They receive a quarterly newsletter and annual report, but do not have any privileged rights (i.e. the bothies themselves are equally open to all).

== Structure ==

===Maintenance Organisers===
Each bothy has one Maintenance Organiser (or, in some cases, a small team of two or three), who monitor the bothy and arrange routine maintenance. MOs are the lifeblood of the organisation, All except one, namely a Mr Geoff Allan, who used his position to compile a guidebook available commercially. This was later endorsed by the MBA, and has went on to sell 30000 copies (at time of edit), trousering a healthy profit for the author and MO in question. This has led to heated discussions and bad blood, due to one person profiteering of the backs of volunteers efforts, not to mention the assets of a registered charity.
===Area Organisers===
The UK is divided into nine areas:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mountainbothies.org.uk/cust_images/new%20SO%20section%20D.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Northern Highlands
* North West Highlands and Islands
* Western Highlands and Islands
* Central Highlands
* South West Highlands and Islands
* Eastern Highlands
* Southern Scotland
* Northern England and Borders
* Wales

The Maintenance Organisers of the bothies in each area form the respective Area Committees. Each committee elects an Area Organiser to chair their meetings and to represent the area to the Management Committee. Each area also chooses an Area Rep to attend the (national) Management Committee meetings.

===Project Organisers===
Project Organisers run a particular renovation or major maintenance project. This is a short-term responsibility, unlike that of a Maintenance Organiser.

=== Management Committee ===
The Management Committee is responsible for the day-to-day running of the association. It has an overview of maintenance matters and advises the Board of Trustees on policy. It also appoints a Director of Projects, who supports and oversees the work of the Area Organisers, and advises the Association on building practice and health and safety.

=== Board of Trustees ===
The Board of Trustees is directly elected by the members. It has control over the finances and is responsible for managing the company.

An '''NHS care trust''', is a type of [[NHS trust]] in the [[National Health Service (England)|English National Health Service]] and [[NHS Wales]] that provides both [[health]] and [[social care]]. They may carry out a range of services, including social care, [[mental health]] services or [[primary care]] services. Care Trusts are set up when the NHS and [[Local Authority|Local Authorities]] agree to work closely together, usually where it is felt that a closer relationship between health and social care is needed or would benefit local care services.

Care Trusts were established under the [[NHS Plan 2000]], in [[England]] to bring together in one legal entity the commissioning and provision of health and social care services, especially for older people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A question of trust|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/a-question-of-trust/28159.article#.UqTZ7-ImRPY|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=19 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Torbay and Southern Devon Health and Care NHS Trust]] was regarded as the most successful.  Others are [[Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust]], [[Bradford District Care Trust]], [[Kent and Medway NHS and Social Care Partnership Trust]] and [[Sheffield Health &amp; Social Care NHS Foundation Trust]]

Care Trusts do not exist in [[Scotland]], nor are there plans to introduce them.

In Northern Ireland Health and Social Care is organised through five Sub-regional health and social care trusts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3484">The '''National Gamete Donation Service''' (NGDS) raises awareness of the national shortage of [[Sperm donation|sperm]], [[Egg donation|egg]] and [[embryo]] donors in the [[UK]]. Its aim is to recruit donors to alleviate the shortage, and it provides information on egg, sperm and embryo donation and donor recruitment in the UK.

It works closely with clinics, donors, recipients, the Department of Health, the [[HFEA]], other professional organisations and the media, and provides impartial and confidential information to all.

==Support and advice==
The NGDS works within the UK only (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland) to provide information, advice and support to people wishing to become donors and to people who need donors.

The Service runs a National Helpline; all calls, messages and emails are treated confidentially. There are also separate, closed mailing lists for donors and recipients to discuss issues related to donation. Enquirers can be put in contact with existing donors to find out more about what donation involves.

==Campaigns==
The Service works with the Department of Health on campaigns to recruit donors, most recently the 'Have you got the balls'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bionews.org.uk/page_52879.asp Will sports fans have 'the balls' for sperm donation?&lt;/ref&gt; campaign which ran in the Manchester area (2010–11).

The Service ran a national Donor Satisfaction Survey&lt;ref&gt;http://ngdt.co.uk/donor-satisfaction-survey Donor Satisfaction Survey&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012 to gather information from UK donors about their experience, and about why people chose not to donate, and use it to improve donor care in clinics.

The Service has improved awareness of the need for donors and recruited donors in ways that can be controversial. The 'Give a Toss'&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/mar/26/newmedia.advertising Online ads for sperm donors called offensive&lt;/ref&gt; campaign generated complaints but  the Trust received over 500 enquiries from prospective donors over three months.

==Funding ==
The Service is funded mainly by a Section 64 Grant from the Department of Health.

==Founding and members ==
The Service was initially set up as the National Gamete Donation Trust by the [[Donor Conception Network]] (DC Network) and the [[Infertility Network]] (INUK) to develop and continue the work of [[NEEDS]] (The National Egg and Embryo Donation Society). It was founded on 2 March 1998 by a working group consisting of representatives from: 
 
*The [[Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists]]
*The [[Royal College of General Practitioners]]
*The [[Royal College of Nursing]]
*The [[Royal College of Midwives]]
*The [[British Fertility Society]]
*The [[British Andrology Society]]
*The [[British Infertility Counselling Association]]
*[[Progress Educational Trust]]
*[[Donor Conception Network]]
*[[Infertility Network UK]]

In 2012 it won a bid to take over the running of the national Contact Register which links donors and donor-conceived people. The name changed to the National Gamete Donation Service.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3732">'''Observations of daily living''' ('''ODLs''') are cues that people attend to in the course of their everyday life, that inform them about their health.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf Health in Everyday Living] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522145954/http://www.projecthealthdesign.org/media/file/E-primer_3.pdf |date=2016-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/files/student_projects/Observations_of_Daily_Living.pdf Observations of Daily Living]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bookshelf/br.fcgi?book=erta188 Impact of Consumer Health Informatics Applications], Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)&lt;/ref&gt; 

ODLs are different from [[medical sign|signs]], [[symptoms]], and clinical indicators in that they are defined by the patient, and are not necessarily directly mapped to [[biomedical model]]s of disease and illness. Examples of ODLs include observations about [[sleep pattern]]s, exercise behavior and activity trackers, nutritional intake,&lt;ref&gt;[http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2010/03/19/foundations-striving-to-prevent-obesity/ Foundations Striving to Prevent Obesity], Health Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; attitudes and moods, alertness at work or in class, and environmental features such as clutter in the living or working space.  Not all patient-generated data constitute ODLs. For example, a patient with [[diabetes]] may record their [[blood glucose level]]s every day at home, generating data to share with their clinician. That kind of patient-generated data is crucial to inform clinical decision making, but does not constitute ODLs. ODLs are typically defined by patients&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ris.org/uploadi/editor/1232628818PIPHealthAug08.pdf The Engaged E-patient Population]&lt;/ref&gt; and their families&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2010/08/17/tracking-observations-of-daily-living-in-infants-and-the-elderly Tracking 'Observations of Daily Living' in Infants and the Elderly (WSJ)]&lt;/ref&gt; because they are meaningful to them,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/02/magazine/02self-measurement-t.html?pagewanted=all The Data Driven Life (NYT)]&lt;/ref&gt; and help them self-manage their health&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703960004575427531544486778 How Life's Details Help Patients (WSJ)]&lt;/ref&gt; and make decisions about it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1605297291/ref=cm_sw_su_dp The Decision Tree: Taking Control of Your Health in the New Era of Personalized Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; ODLs may very well complement biomedical indicators and inform medical decision making by providing a more complete and holistic view of the patient as a whole person,&lt;ref&gt;Jaen CR, Brennan, PF.

'''PMFTC, Inc.''' is a joint-venture company between Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing, Inc. (PMPMI) and Fortune Tobacco Corporation (FTC). The company controls over 90% of the Philippine [[cigarette]] market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/25/10/philip-morris-fortune-tobacco-merge-rp-operations|title=Philip Morris, Fortune Tobacco form joint venture|first=ABS-CBN|last=News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 2010, both companies signed an agreement to unite their respective business activities by transferring selected assets and liabilities of both companies a new company namned '''PMFTC, Inc.''', with each party holding an equal economic interest. [[Lucio Tan]] serves as the chairman of PMFTC, Inc., while day-to-day operations is managed by [[Philip Morris International]] (PMI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmi.com/eng/media_center/press_releases/pages/201002250240.aspx|title=Philip Morris International Inc.

PMFTC would not be affected by pending tax and ownership disputes with local courts involving FTC.

==History==

In 1955, Philip Morris International entered into a licensing agreement with La Suerte Cigar and Cigarette Factory to manufacture and sell [[Marlboro (cigarette)|Marlboro]] cigarettes in the Philippines. 

Fortune Tobacco Corporation (FTC) was established in 1966 founded by Benito Tan Kee Hiong, Atty. Florencio N. Santos, Lucio Tan and Mariano Tanenglian.

In 1995, Philip Morris Philippines, Inc. (PMPI) was established to handle all sales and marketing aspects related to the Marlboro and Philip Morris brands. 

In 2002, the licensing agreement with La Suerte was terminated and Philip Morris Philippines Manufacturing, Inc. (PMPMI) was established to handle all aspects of the Philippine business, including manufacturing operations. PMPI was subsequently merged with PMPMI. A new factory located in [[Tanauan, Batangas]] was inaugurated by PMPMI in 2003.

On February 2010, PMFTC, Inc. was established.

'''Project Prevention''' (formerly '''Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity''' or '''CRACK''') is an American [[non-profit organization]] that pays [[drug addict]]s cash for volunteering for long-term [[birth control]], including [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]]. Originally based in California and now based in North Carolina, the organization began operating in the United Kingdom in 2010. The organization offers US$300 (£200 in the UK) to each participant. Barbara Harris founded the organization in 1997 after she and her husband adopted the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth children of a drug-addicted mother.&lt;ref name="Gostin"&gt;Gostin, Nicki. [http://www.parentdish.com/2011/03/24/barbara-harris-project-prevention/ "Barbara Harris on Adopting Drug-Addicted Babies and Why She Started Project Prevention"]. 24 March 2011. Retrieved 07 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 7 October 2011 the organization had paid 3,848 clients.

== History ==
Barbara Harris founded the organization in [[Anaheim, California]] in 1997 as Children Requiring a Caring Kommunity (CRACK) after she and her husband adopted one-by-one as each was born the latter four of eight children from a drug-addicted mother.  Each of the four adopted children is separated in age by only one year.&lt;ref name="Gostin" /&gt; With the experience of helping the children through [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] and other health problems, she tried to get legislation passed in California that would have mandated long-term birth control for mothers who gave birth to babies who were [[prenatal cocaine exposure|exposed to cocaine as fetuses]].&lt;ref name="Gostin" /&gt; After this failed she started what is now called Project Prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectprevention.org/faq/ "Frequently Asked Questions"]. Project Prevention. Retrieved 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2002/05/09/Interview-Barbara-Harris/68231020948346/|title=Interview: Barbara Harris|publisher=[[United Press International]]|date=9 May 2002|last=Sailer|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Sailer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Project Prevention says their main goal is to promote awareness of the dangers of using drugs during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="ppobj"&gt;[http://projectprevention.org/objectives/ "Objectives"]. Project Prevention. Retrieved 2 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; They are better known, however, for paying [[drug addict]]s cash for volunteering for long-term [[birth control]], including [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]]. The organization offers US$300 (£200 in the UK) to each participant. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reports that the organization initially offered more money to women who chose [[tubal ligation]]s and men who chose [[vasectomy|vasectomies]] than to those who chose long-term birth control like [[intrauterine device]]s, but criticism forced them to adopt a flat rate.&lt;ref name="nytsel"&gt;Vega, Cecilia M. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0612FC3F5A0C758CDDA80894DB404482 "Sterilization Offer to Addicts Reopens Ethics Issue"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 6 January 2003. Retrieved 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; To receive the money, clients have to show evidence they have been arrested on a drug-related offence, or provide a doctor's certificate saying they use drugs, and further evidence is needed confirming that the birth-control procedure has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8500285.stm "Should drug addicts be paid to get sterilised?"]. [[BBC News]]. 8 February 2010. Retrieved 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization keeps statistics on its activities through survey forms that all participants fill out, before any procedure is completed. As of May 2014 based on survey forms from 4,913 clients it had paid: 2,876 (58.5%) were [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]]; 1,020 (20.8%) [[African American]]; 569 (11.6%) [[Hispanic]]; 448 (9.1%) other.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectprevention.org/statistics/ "Statistics"]. Project Prevention. 17 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and response==
The organization has used slogans such as "Don’t let pregnancy get in the way of your crack habit" and "She has her Daddy’s eyes and her Mommy’s heroin addiction".&lt;ref name="sob"&gt;Swaine, Jon. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/8071664/Drug-addict-sterilised-for-cash-but-can-Barbara-Harris-save-our-babies.html "Drug addict sterilised for cash - but can Barbara Harris save our babies?"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 19 October 2010. Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews Harris said "We don’t allow dogs to breed. We spay them. We neuter them. We try to keep them from having unwanted puppies, and yet these women are literally having litters of children",&lt;ref&gt;[http://cwpe.org/node/56 "CRACK Uses Unethical Tactics to Stop Women with Substance Abuse Problems"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403062033/http://cwpe.org/node/56 |date=2010-04-03 }}, Harris later revealed in an interview that she was quoting sister of one of her clients. [[Committee on Women, Population, and the Environment]]. 13 July 2006. Retrieved 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and that "we campaign to neuter dogs and yet we allow women to have 10 or 12 kids that they can’t take care of".&lt;ref&gt;Dateno, Sarah. [http://www.pop.org/00000000187/coercive-pop-control-comes-home "Coercive Pop Control Comes Home: 'CRACK' Program Offers Women Payment to Be Sterilized"]. ''PRI Review'' ([[Population Research Institute]]) '''9''' (5). August/September 1999. Retrieved 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On the television news program ''[[60 Minutes II]]'' Harris was asked about these comments and said, "Well, you know my son that goes to Stanford said ‘mom, please don’t ever say that again,’ but it’s the truth, they don’t just have one and two babies, they have litters."&lt;ref&gt;Paltrow, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, Harris has offered a softer response to criticism: "I guess it depends on where your heart is. Some people are so into the women and their rights to get pregnant that they seem to forget about the rights of the kids. They act like these children don't matter.  People need to realize these women don't want to have babies that are taken away from them. Nothing positive comes to the woman who has eight children taken away from her."&lt;ref name="Gostin" /&gt;

Opponents of the organization often argue that it should instead focus on addiction treatment or lobbying for government health care.&lt;ref name="nytsel"/&gt; The organization responds by saying that they do not have the resources to solve "national problems of poverty, housing, nutrition, education and rehabilitation services. Those resources we do have are spent to prevent a problem for $300 rather than paying millions after it happens in cost to care for a potentially damaged child."&lt;ref name="ppobj"/&gt; Weaning one opioid-addicted baby off drugs costs about $500,000.&lt;ref name="sob"/&gt;

== United Kingdom ==
Project Prevention began operating in the UK in 2010. In May 2010 a woman, not an addict, was leaving a clinic in Glasgow in what she described as "the Possilpark area - it's a well-known area for drugs" accompanied by her nine-year-old son when she was approached by three women who said they were from the organization and who offered her £200 if she agreed to be sterilized. The woman said the same group had been approaching other women, and she later informed Strathclyde police, who advised anyone approached in a similar way to contact them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/glasgow_and_west/10143746.stm "Woman offered '£200 to be sterilised'"]. [[BBC News]]. 23 May 2010. Retrieved 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The first UK client was "John", a drug user since the age of 12, who accepted money to have a vasectomy, saying he should never be a father.&lt;ref name=BBC17Oct10&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-11545519 "Charity offers UK drug addicts £200 to be sterilised"]. [[BBC News]]. 17 October 2010. Retrieved 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has been criticized in the UK. [[Addaction]], an addiction charity, said its practices are "morally reprehensible and irrelevant".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Jerome. [https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/charity-that-sterilises-addicts-to-come-to-uk-1940722.html "Charity that sterilises addicts to come to UK"]. ''[[The Independent]]''. 10 April 2010. Retrieved 21 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Martin Barnes, CEO of [[DrugScope]], said the organization's activities were exploitative, ethically dubious, and morally questionable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drugscope.org.uk/ourwork/pressoffice/pressreleases/Project_Prevention_Statement "Project Prevention is "exploitative, ethically dubious and morally questionable" says DrugScope"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028211249/http://www.drugscope.org.uk/ourwork/pressoffice/pressreleases/Project_Prevention_Statement |date=2010-10-28 }}. [[DrugScope]]. 18 October 2010. Retrieved 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris admitted her methods amounted to bribery, but said it was the only way to stop babies being physically and mentally damaged by drugs during pregnancy. The [[British Medical Association]] (BMA) said it did not have a view on the organization:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
As with all requests for treatment, doctors need to be confident that the individual has the capacity to make the specific decision at the time the decision is required. The BMA's ethics committee also believes that doctors should inform patients of the benefits of reversible contraception so that the patients have more reproductive choices in the future.&lt;ref name=BBC17Oct10/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; On 18 October 2010 the [[BBC]] broadcast a program, ''Sterilising The Addicts'', about the organization&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vhdw9 Inside Out London – 18/10/2010]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;—a similar program, ''Addicts: No Children Allowed'', was broadcast in Scotland by [[BBC Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vfjg3 "Addicts: No Children Allowed"]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ireland ==
Harris said in 2010 that Project Prevention might expand their activities to Ireland. In response Fiona Weldon, clinical director of Dublin addictions treatment facility, the Rutland Centre, said it was "absolutely horrendous", and that the organization was misguided and could be leaving itself open to litigation in the future. Tony Geoghegan, CEO of drug addiction and homeless charity Merchants Quay Ireland, said it was inappropriate to sterilize addicts.&lt;ref&gt;Meagher, John. [http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/well-pay-irish-drug-addicts-to-be-sterilised-2150811.html "We'll pay Irish drug addicts to be sterilised"]. ''[[Irish Independent]]''. 24 April 2010.

The modern public health system in [[India]] evolved due to a number of influences from the past 70 years, including [[United Kingdom|British]] influence from the colonial period.&lt;ref name=healthsystemsinindia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chokshi|first1=M|last2=Patil|first2=B|last3=Khanna|first3=R|last4=Neogi|first4=S|last5=Sharma|first5=J|last6=Paul|first6=V|last7=Zodpey|first7=S|title=Health systems in India|journal=Journal of Perinatology|date=December 2016|volume=36|doi=10.1038/jp.2016.184|pmc=5144115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for an efficient and effective '''public health system in India''' is large. 20% of all [[maternal deaths]] and 25% of all child deaths in the world occur in India. 34 out of 1000 children are dead by the time they reach the age of 5.&lt;ref name= "healthcareandequityinindia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Balarajan|first1=Yarlini|last2=Selvaraj|first2=S|last3=Subramanian|first3=S|title=Health care and equity in India|journal=Lancet|date=11 January 2011|volume=377|issue=9764|pages=505–515|pmc=3093249}}&lt;/ref&gt; 58% of Indians are immunized in urban areas compared to only 39% in rural areas. Communicable disease is the cause of death for 53% of all deaths in India.&lt;ref name= "healthcareandequityinindia"/&gt;

Public health initiatives that affect people in all states, such as the National Mental Health Program, are instilled by the Union [[Ministry of Health and Family Welfare]].&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt; There are multiple systems set up in rural and urban areas of India including Primary Health Centres, Community Health Centres, Sub Centres, and Government Hospitals. These agencies must follow the standards set by Indian Public Health Standards documents that are revised when needed.&lt;ref name=twelfthfiveyearplan&gt;{{cite book|title=Twelfth Five Year Plan (2012-17)|publisher=Planning Commission, Government of India, New Dehli|edition=Vol-III,|url=http://planningcommission.nic.in/plans/planrel/fiveyr/12th/pdf/12fyp_vol3.pdf|chapter=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ter

==History==
Public health systems in the colonial period were focused on health care for British citizens that were living in India. The period saw [[research institutes]], public health legislation, and sanitation departments, although only 3% of Indian households had toilets at this time.&lt;ref name= publichealthinindia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gupta|first1=Monica|title=Public Health in India: Dangerous Neglect|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=December 2005|volume=40|issue=49|pages=5159–5165|jstor= 4417485}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annual health reports were released and the prevention of contagious disease outbreaks was stressed. At the end of the colonial period, death rates from [[infectious diseases]] such as [[cholera]] had fallen to a low, although other diseases were still rampant.&lt;ref name="publichealthinindia"/&gt;

In modern day India, the spread of communicable diseases is under better control and now non-communicable diseases, especially [[cardiovascular diseases]], are major killers.&lt;ref name= "publichealthinindia"/&gt; Health care reform was prioritized in the 1946 [[Bhore Committee]] Report which suggested the implementation of a health care system that was financed at least in part by the Indian government.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt; In 1983 the first National Health Policy (NHP) of India was created with the goals of establishing a system with primary-care facilities and a referral system. In 2002, the updated NHP focused on improving the practicality and reach of the system as well as incorporating private and public [[clinics]] into the health sphere.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt;

Public health funding has been directed to helping the middle and upper classes, as it targets creating more health professional jobs, expanding research institutions, and improving training. This creates unequal access to health care for the lower classes who do not receive the benefits of this funding.&lt;ref name= "publichealthinindia"/&gt; Today, states pay for about 75% of the public healthcare system but insufficient state spending neglects the public health system in India.&lt;ref name= betterhealthsystemsforIndiaspoor&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peters|first1=David|title=Better Health Systems for India's Poor: Findings, Analysis, and Options|date=Jan 1, 2002|publisher=World Bank Publications|chapter=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

The healthcare system is organised into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. At the primary level are Sub Centres and Primary Health Centres (PHCs). At the secondary level there are Community Health Centres (CHCs) and smaller Sub-District hospitals. Finally, the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level, which consists of Medical Colleges and District/General Hospitals.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt; The number of PHCs, CHCs, Sub Centres, and District Hospitals has increased in the past six years, although not all of them are up to the standards set by Indian Public Health Standards.&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt;

===Sub Centres===
A Sub Centre is designed to serve extremely rural areas with the expenses fully covered by the national government. Mandates require health staff to be at least two workers (male and female) to serve a population of 5000 people (or 3000 in a remote, dangerous location). Sub Centres also work to educate rural peoples about healthy habits for a more long-term impact.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt;

===Primary Health Centres===
Primary Health Centres exist in more developed rural areas of 30,000 or more (20,000 in remote areas) and serve as larger health clinics staffed with doctors and paramedics. Patients can be referred from local sub centres to PHCs for more complex cases.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt; A major difference from Sub Centres is that state governments fund PHCs, not the national government. PHCs also function to improve health education with a larger emphasis on preventative measures.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt;

===Community Health Centres===
A Community Health Centre is also funded by state governments and accepts patients referred from Primary Health Centres. It serves 120,000 people in urban areas or 80,000 people in remote areas.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt; Patients from these agencies can be transferred to general hospitals for further treatments. Thus, CHC's are also  first referral units, or FRUs, which are required to have obstetric care, new born/childcare, and blood storage capacities at all hours everyday of the week.&lt;ref name="healthsystemsinindia"/&gt;

===District Hospitals===
District Hospitals are the final referral centres for the primary and secondary levels of the public health system. It is expected that at least one hospital is in each district of India, although in 2010 it was recorded that only 605 hospitals exist when there are 640 districts.&lt;ref name= guidelinesfordistricthospitals&gt;{{cite journal|title=Guidelines for District Hospitals|journal=Indian Public Health Standards|date=2012|url=http://www.nhm.gov.in/images/pdf/guidelines/iphs/iphs-revised-guidlines-2012/district-hospital.pdf|accessdate=9 March 2018|publisher=Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are normally anywhere between 75 to 500 beds, depending on population demand. These district hospitals often lack modern equipment and relations with local blood banks.&lt;ref name= "guidelinesfordistricthospitals"/&gt;

===Medical Colleges and Research Institutions===
[[All India Institutes of Medical Sciences]] is owned and controlled by the central government. These are referral hospitals with specialized facilities. All India Institutes presently functional are AIMS [[New Delhi]], AIIMS [[Bhopal]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiimsbhopal.edu.in/ AIIMS Bhopal.]&lt;/ref&gt; AIIMS Bhubaneshwar, AIIMS [[Jodhpur]], AIIMS [[Raipur]], and AIIMS [[Rishikesh]]. A [[Regional Cancer Centre]] is a cancer care hospital and research institute controlled jointly by the central and the respective state governments. Government Medical Colleges are owned and controlled by the respective state governments and also function as referral hospitals.

==Government Public Health Initiatives==

In 2006, the [[Public Health Foundation of India]] was started by the Prime Minister of India as both a private and public initiative. The goal of this organisation is to incorporate more public health policies and diverse professionals into the healthcare sphere. PHFI is also collaborating with international public health organisations to gather more knowledge and direct discussions around needs and improvements to the current system.&lt;ref name=publichealthfoundationofindia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reddy|first1=K|last2=Sivaramakrishnan|first2=Kavita|title=Unmet National Health Needs: Visions of Public Health Foundation of India|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=16 September 2016|volume=41|issue=37|pages=3927–3933|url=https://www.jstor.org.libproxy.berkeley.edu/stable/4418695|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often times officials in policy making positions have a gap in their education about public health, and [[Master of Public Health|MPH]] and [[PhD]] programs in public health are lacking in their number of students and resources. PHFI aims to further these programs and educate more people in this field. The research discovered would be made transparent to the Indian public at large, so that the entire nation is aware of health standards in the country.&lt;ref name=publichealthfoundationofindia/&gt;

==Drawbacks==

Drawbacks to India's public health system today include low quality care, [[corruption]], unhappiness with the system, a lack of accountability, unethical care, overcrowding of clinics, poor cooperation between public and private spheres, barriers of access to services and medicines, lack of [[public health]] knowledge, and low affordability.&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt;&lt;ref name= understandinggovernmentfailureinpublichealthservices&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hammer|first1=Jeffrey|last2=Aiyar|first2=Yamini|last3=Samji|first3=Salimah|title=Understanding Government Failure in Public Health Services|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=6 October 2017|volume=42|issue=40|pages=4049–4057|jstor= 40276648}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drawbacks push wealthier Indians to use the [[private healthcare]] system, which is less accessible to low-income families, creating unequal medical treatment between classes.&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt;

===Low quality care===

Low quality care is prevalent due to misdiagnosis, under trained health professionals, and the prescription of incorrect medicines. A study discovered a doctor in a PHC in [[Delhi]] who prescribed the wrong treatment method 50% of the time.&lt;ref name="understandinggovernmentfailureinpublichealthservices"/&gt; Indians in rural areas where this problem is rampant are prevented from improving their health situation.&lt;ref name="healthcareandequityinindia"/&gt; Enforcement and revision of the regulations set by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare IPHS is also not strict. The [[12th Five-Year Plan (India)]] dictates a need to improve enforcement and institutionalize treatment methods across all clinics in the nation in order to increase the quality of care.&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt; There is also a lack of accountability across both private and public clinics in India, although public doctors feel less responsibility to treat their patients effectively than do doctors in private clinics. Impolite interactions from the clinic staff may lead to less effective procedures.&lt;ref name="understandinggovernmentfailureinpublichealthservices"/&gt;

=== Corruption ===
Healthcare professionals take more time off from work than the amount they are allotted with the majority of absences being for no official reason.&lt;ref name="understandinggovernmentfailureinpublichealthservices"/&gt; India's public healthcare system pays salaries during absences, leading to excessive personal days being paid for by the government. This phenomenon is especially heightened in Sub Centres and PHCs and results in expenditure that isn't correlated to better work performance.&lt;ref name="understandinggovernmentfailureinpublichealthservices"/&gt;

=== Overcrowding of clinics===
Clinics are overcrowded and understaffed without enough beds to support their patients. Statistics show that the number of health professionals in India is less than the average number for other developing nations.&lt;ref name="betterhealthsystemsforIndiaspoor"/&gt; In rural [[Bihar]] the number of doctors is 0.3 for every 10,000 individuals. Urban hospitals have twice the number of beds than rural hospitals do but the number is still insufficient to provide for the large number of patients that visit.&lt;ref name= "healthcareandequityinindia"/&gt; Sometimes patients are referred from rural areas to larger hospitals, increasing the overcrowding in urban cities.&lt;ref name=thechallengesconfrontingpublichospitalsinindia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bajpai|first1=Vikas|title=The Challenges Confronting Public Hospitals in India, Their Origins, and Possible Solutions|journal=Advances in Public Health|date=13 July 2014|volume=2014|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor cooperation between public and private spheres===
5% of visits to health practitioners are in private clinics or hospitals, many of which are paid for out of pocket. Money is spent on improving private services instead of on funding the public sector.&lt;ref name="understandinggovernmentfailureinpublichealthservices"/&gt; Governmental failure to initiate and foster effective partnerships between the public and private healthcare spheres results in financial contracts that aren't negotiated to help the common man. These contracts would allow the private sector to finance projects to improve knowledge and facilities in the public sphere.&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt;

===Barriers of access===
Both social and financial inequality results in barriers of access to healthcare services in India. Services aren't accessible for the disabled, mentally challenged, and elderly populations.&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt; Mothers are disadvantaged and in many rural areas there is a lack of abortion services and contraception methods. Public clinics often have a shortage of the appropriate medicines or may supply them at excessively high prices, resulting in large out of pocket costs (even for those with insurance coverage).&lt;ref name="twelfthfiveyearplan"/&gt; Large distances prevent Indians from getting care, and if families travel the far distance there is low assurance that they will receive proper proper medical attention at that time.&lt;ref name= "healthcareandequityinindia"/&gt;

''Vpered'' was converted into a [[hospital ship]] when [[World War I]] broke out and operated in the [[Black Sea]] to evacuate wounded Russian soldiers from the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]].&lt;ref name=NHE/&gt;

On 8 July 1916, ''Vpered'' was [[torpedo]]ed by the [[Imperial German Navy]] [[submarine]] [[SM U-38|SM ''U-38'']] in the Black Sea between Rizeh and [[Batum]]. She sank shortly after. She was not carrying any wounded soldiers at the time, but seven people died in her sinking. Her survivors were saved a short time later.&lt;ref&gt;П.Г.Усенко (P.G.Usenko), [http://www.history.org.ua/JournALL/journal/2005/6/5.pdfЗ IСТОРIЇ ВЕЛИКОЇ ВIЙНИ 1914–1917 рр.

And other imponderables of everyday life. Harper and Row, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weis, J.S. (2011) Do fish sleep? Fascinating answers to questions about fishes. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick.&lt;/ref&gt;  In birds and mammals, sleep is defined by eye closure and the presence of typical patterns of electrical activity in the brain, including the [[neocortex]], but fish lack eyelids and a neocortex.  Some species that always live in shoals or that swim continuously (because of a need for ram ventilation of the gills, for example) are suspected never to sleep.&lt;ref name=Kavanau1998&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kavanau JL |title= Vertebrates that never sleep: implications for sleep's basic function |journal=Brain Res.

Other fish seem to sleep, however, especially when purely behavioral criteria are used to define sleep.

On the other hand, sleep patterns are easily disrupted and may even disappear during periods of migration, spawning, and parental care.&lt;ref&gt;Reebs, S.G.

== Behavioural sleep ==
Instead of examining brain activity for sleep patterns, an alternate approach is to examine any rest/activity cycles that might indicate "behavioural sleep". The following four behavioural criteria are characteristic of sleep in birds and mammals and could be extended to fishes:  (1) prolonged inactivity; (2) typical resting posture, often in a typical shelter; (3) alternation with activity in a 24-h cycle; (4) high arousal thresholds. Based on these criteria, many fish species have been observed sleeping.&lt;ref name="Reebs"/&gt;  The typical sleep posture of the [[brown bullhead]] is with the fins stretched out, the tail lying flat on the bottom, the body inclined to one side at an angle of 10-30 degrees to the vertical, the cardiac and respiratory frequencies much slower than normal, and much less sensitivity to sound and to being touched.&lt;ref&gt;Titkov, E.S. (1976) Characteristics of the daily periodicity of wakefulness and rest in the brown bullhead (''Ictalurus nebulosus''), Journal of Evolutionary Biochemistry and Physiology 12: 305-309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karmanova, I.G., Belich, A.I., and Lazarev, S.G. (1981) An electrophysiological study of wakefulness and sleeplike states in fish and amphibians, pp. 181-202 ''In'': Brain Mechanisms of Behaviour in Lower Vertebrates (P.R. Laming, ed.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mozambique tilapia]] are motionless at the bottom at night, with a lower respiratory rate and no eye movement, and they do not respond as readily as during the day to electrical currents or food delivery.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, C.M., and Hepburn, H.R. (1976) Sleep in a schooling fish, ''Tilapia mossambica''. Physiology and Behavior 16: 613-615.&lt;/ref&gt; At night, [[Spanish hogfish]],  [[bluehead wrasse]], the wrasse ''[[Halichoeres bivittatus]]'', the cunner ''[[Tautogolabrus adspersus]]'', and even [[requiem sharks]], can be picked up by hand without eliciting a response.&lt;ref&gt; Tauber, E.S., Weitzman, E.D., and Korey, S.R. (1969) Eye movements during behavioral inactivity in certain Bermuda reef fish. Communications in Behavioral Biology A 3: 131-135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tauber, E.S. (1974) The phylogeny of sleep, pages 133-172 ''In'': Advances in sleep research, vol. 1 (E.D. Weitzman, ed.). Spectrum Publications, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, E.

Chesapeake Science 17: 101-103.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1961 observational study of approximately 200 species in European public aquaria reported many cases of apparent sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, E. (1961) Über Ruhelagen von Fischen, Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie 18: 517–533.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Divers can easily see fishes settling down for the night in typical shelters, such as holes and crevices, underneath ledges, amidst vegetation, inside sponges, or buried in sand.&lt;ref&gt;Reebs, S.G. (1992) Sleep, inactivity, and circadian rhythms in fish.  Pp. 127-135 ''In'' Rhythms in Fishes (M.A. Ali, editor).  Plenum, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some extra protection can be derived from special secretions, such as the mucous envelope produced by several species of [[wrasse]] and [[parrotfish]], either around the fish themselves or at the opening of their shelter. These envelopes screen the sleeping fish from predators&lt;ref&gt; Winn, H.E., and Bardach, J.E. (1959) Differential food selection by moray eels and a possible role of the mucous envelope of parrot fishes in reduction of predation. Ecology 40: 296-298.&lt;/ref&gt;  and ectoparasites.&lt;ref&gt; Grutter, A.S., Rumney, J.G., Sinclair-Taylor, T., Waldie, P., and Franklin, C.E. (2011) Fish mucous cocoons: the "mosquito nets" of the sea. Biology Letters 7: 292-294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the laboratory, periods of inactivity often alternate with periods of activity on a 24-h basis, or a near 24-h basis when the lighting conditions are constant. [[Circadian rhythms]] of activity have been documented in over 40 different fish species, including [[hagfish]], [[lamprey]], [[shark|sharks]], [[cyprinidae|cyprinids]], [[ictaluridae|ictalurids]], [[naked-back knifefish|gymnotids]], [[salmon|salmonids]], and [[wrasse|labrids]].&lt;ref&gt; Reebs S.G.

== Physiological sleep ==

One physiological characteristic of sleep goes by the name of "[[homeostasis|homeostatic]] regulation". This is the notion that animals need a more or less constant amount of sleep every day, so that if a subject is deprived of sleep one day, the amount of sleep tends to "rebound" (increase) the next few days. This has been observed in [[zebrafish]]. At night, zebrafish appear to float in the water column, either horizontally or with the head slightly up. The frequency of mouth and gill movement is reduced by almost half and they are twice as hard to arouse as during the day. If they are deprived of this sleep-like behaviour, the sleep bouts thereafter are longer and the arousal threshold is higher than usual, suggesting a rebound effect.&lt;ref&gt; Zhdanova, I.V., Wang, S.Y., Leclair, O.U., and Danilova, N.P. (2001) Melatonin promotes sleep-like state in zebrafish. Brain Research 903: 263-268.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yokogawa, T., Marin, W., Faraco, J., Pézeron, G., Appelbaum, L., Zhang, J., Rosa, F., Mourrain, P., and Mignot, E. (2007) Characterization of sleep in zebrafish and insomnia in hypocretin receptor mutants. PloS Biology 5: 2379-2397.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, in the [[convict cichlid]], activity decreases on days that follow an experimental disruption of the fish's normal rest behaviour at night.&lt;ref&gt;Tobler, I., and Borbély, A.A. (1985) Effet of rest deprivation on motor activity of fish. Journal of Comparative Physiology A 157: 817-822.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Absence of sleep ==
[[File:Wooden plate.jpg|thumb|right|Traditionally [[Mahayana Buddhist]]s believed fish never sleep, and fish became a symbol of wakefulness. Pictured is a hollow slit drum called a [[wooden fish]] or Chinese temple block. These are used when chanting [[sutra]]s to keep the rhythm and remind practitioners to remain alert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blades|first=James|title=Percussion instruments and their history|year=1992|publisher=Bold Strummer|location=Westport|isbn=9780933224612|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Many [[pelagic]] fish species, such as [[bluefish]], [[Atlantic mackerel]], [[tuna]], [[bonito]], and some sharks, swim continuously and do not show signs, behavioural or otherwise, of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Olla, B.L., and Studholme, A.L. (1978) Comparative aspects of the activity rhythms of tautog, ''Tautoga onitis'', Bluefish, ''Pomatomus saltatrix'', and Atlantic mackerel, ''Scomber scombrus'', as related to their life habits. Pp. 131-151 ''In'': Rhythmic Activity of Fishes (J.E. Thorpe, ed.). Academic Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kavanau1998 /&gt;  It has been argued that one function of sleep is to allow the brain to consolidate into memory the things it has learned during the animal's normal period of activity. The brain might not be able to do this while still assailed by new stimuli and new information to process. Therefore the role of sleep would be to periodically shut down sensory input to allow the brain to form memories. Pelagic species swim in an environment that is rather boring (kilometers upon kilometers of open water with not much happening in it). In such species, the sensory input is so low that memory formation could take place even if the fish keeps on moving (a repetitive activity) and does not fall asleep in the traditional sense of the word.&lt;ref&gt;Kavanau, J.L. (2010) Schooling by continuously active fishes: clues to sleep's ultimate function, Pp. 57-85 ''In'': Evolution of sleep: phylogenetic and functional perspectives (McNamara, P., Barton, R.A., and Nunn, C.L., eds.). Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diurnal [[damselfish]] normally sleep motionless in crevices within coral reefs at night, but three species (the [[Chromis viridis|green chromis]], the [[Dascyllus marginatus|marginate dascyllus]] and the [[whitetail dascyllus]]) spend the night between coral branches where they beat their fins at a rate about twice that of normal daytime swimming. This creates water currents that keep the inner zone of the coral (and thus the fish themselves) well oxygenated, at levels about four times higher than in the absence of the fish. Though the fish are active (mostly in a repetitive way), they do not respond to light or to the presence of potential predators. The researchers who documented this behaviour called it "sleep-swimming".&lt;ref&gt;Goldshmid, R., Holzman, R., Weihs, D., and Genin, A. (2004) Aeration of corals by sleep-swimming fish. Limnology and Oceanography 49: 1832-1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sleep could also be absent during specific parts of a fish's life. Species normally quiescent at night become active day and night during the spawning season.&lt;ref name="Reebs"/&gt;  Many parental species forego sleep at night and fan their eggs day and night for many days in a row. This has been observed in [[threespine stickleback]],&lt;ref&gt; Reebs, S.G., Whoriskey, F.G., and FitzGerald, G.J.

The '''Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB)'''&lt;ref name=pmid19948758 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24203708&gt;{{cite journal |title=Small Molecule Pathway Database.|last=Jewison|first=T|author2=Su Y |author3=Disfany FM |journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Jan 2014|volume=42|issue=Database issue|page=D478-84|doi=10.1093/nar/gkt1067|pmid=24203708 |pmc=3965088|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive, high-quality, freely accessible, online database containing more than 600 [[small molecule]] (i.e. metabolic) pathways found in humans. SMPDB is designed specifically to support pathway elucidation and pathway discovery in [[metabolomics]], [[transcriptomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[systems biology]]. It is able to do so, in part, by providing colorful, detailed, fully searchable, hyperlinked diagrams of five types of small molecule pathways: 1) general human [[metabolic pathway]]s; 2) human metabolic disease pathways; 3) human [[metabolite]] signaling pathways; 4) drug-action pathways and 5) [[drug metabolism]] pathways. SMPDB pathways may be navigated, viewed and zoomed interactively using a Google Maps-like interface.  All SMPDB pathways include information on the relevant [[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[subcellular compartment]]s, [[protein]] cofactors, protein locations, metabolite locations, [[chemical structure]]s and [[protein quaternary structure]]s (Fig. 1). Each [[small molecule]] in SMPDB is hyperlinked to detailed descriptions contained in the HMDB&lt;ref name=pmid17202168&gt;{{cite journal |title=HMDB: the Human Metabolome Database.|vauthors=Wishart DS, Tzur D, Knox C, Eisner R, Guo AC, Young N, Cheng D, Jewell K, Arndt D, Sawhney S, Fung C, Nikolai L, Lewis M, Coutouly MA, Forsythe I, Tang P, Shrivastava S, Jeroncic K, Stothard P, Amegbey G, Block D, Hau DD, Wagner J, Miniaci J, Clements M, Gebremedhin M, Guo N, Zhang Y, Duggan GE, Macinnis GD, Weljie AM, Dowlatabadi R, Bamforth F, Clive D, Greiner R, Li L, Marrie T, Sykes BD, Vogel HJ, Querengesser L |journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Jan 2007|volume=35|issue=Database issue|page=D521–6|doi=10.1093/nar/gkl923|pmid=17202168|pmc=1899095}}&lt;/ref&gt; or DrugBank&lt;ref name=pmid21059682&gt;{{cite journal |title=DrugBank 3.0: a comprehensive resource for 'omics' research on drugs.|last=Knox|first=C |author2=Law, V |author3=Jewison, T |author4=Liu, P |author5=Ly, S |author6=Frolkis, A |author7=Pon, A |author8=Banco, K |author9=Mak, C |author10=Neveu, V |author11=Djoumbou, Y |author12=Eisner, R |author13=Guo, AC |author14=Wishart, DS.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Jan 2011|volume=39|issue=Database issue|page=D1035–41|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1126|pmid=21059682|pmc=3013709}}&lt;/ref&gt; and each [[protein]] or [[enzyme]] complex is hyperlinked to UniProt.&lt;ref name=pmid21051339&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ongoing and future developments at the Universal Protein Resource.|last=UniProt Consortium|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=Jan 2011|volume=39|issue=Database issue|page=D214–9|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1020|pmid=21051339|pmc=3013648}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, all SMPDB pathways are accompanied with detailed descriptions and references, providing an overview of the pathway, condition or processes depicted in each diagram. Users can browse the SMPDB (Fig. 2) or search its contents by text searching (Fig. 3), sequence searching, or [[chemical structure]] searching. More powerful queries are also possible including searching with lists of gene or protein names, drug names, metabolite names, [[GenBank]] IDs, [[Swiss-Prot]] IDs, [[Agilent]] or [[Affymetrix]] [[microarray]] IDs. These queries will produce lists of matching pathways and highlight the matching molecules on each of the pathway diagrams. [[Gene]], [[metabolite]] and [[protein]] concentration data can also be visualized through SMPDB's mapping interface.



SMPDB is part of a suite of [[metabolomics]] databases that also includes [[Human Metabolome Database]], [[DrugBank]], and the [[Toxin and Toxin-Target Database]] (T3DB). While [[DrugBank]] includes information on 7000 drugs and &gt;4200 non-redundant drug targets, [[enzymes]], transporters, and carriers, HMDB houses over 40,000 [[small molecule]] [[metabolites]] found in the human body. The suite is complemented by T3DB with its over 3100 common [[toxic substances]] and over 1300 corresponding toxin targets.

==Version History==
The first version of SMPDB was released on January 1, 2010.&lt;ref name=pmid19948758 /&gt; This release contained more than 350 image-mapped pathways for small molecule pathways.  The viewer interface was limited to scroll-bar image navigation with 3-step (small, medium, large) zooming. The pathways in this first version were limited to 1) human [[metabolic pathway]]s; 2) human metabolic disease pathways; and 3) human metabolite signaling pathways.  The second version of SMPDB was released in 2014.&lt;ref name=pmid24203708 /&gt; This version contained more than 620 small molecule pathways.  The viewer interface was enhanced to include a Google-Map-like interface with click-n-drag image navigation and unlimited, interactive zooming. The pathways in this second version were expanded to include: 1) general human metabolic pathways; 2) human metabolic disease pathways; 3) human metabolite signaling pathways; 4) [[drug action]] pathways and 5) [[drug metabolism]] pathways.

The '''Social interaction approach (SIA)''' is a type of [[brief therapy]].  It is characterised by the client being in charge of the therapy session as the counselor acts as a mediator.  It is based on socio-communicative functions.  It is useful in language advancement, where children cue their parents to supply appropriate language experiences.  SIA provides efficient [[social communication]] at any point in child development.

The '''Spodden Valley asbestos controversy''' arose in May 2004 when approximately {{convert|72|acre|m2}} of land in [[River Spodden|Spodden Valley]] in [[Rochdale]], [[England]], formerly used by [[Turner &amp; Newall|Turner Brothers Asbestos Company]] (later known as [[Turner &amp; Newall]]), and the site of the world's largest [[asbestos]] textile factory, was sold to MMC Estates, a property developer.&lt;ref name="simms"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Simms|first1=Matthew|title=Is the council presenting a fait accompli over asbestos site?|url=http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/21/spodden-valley/15219/is-the-council-presenting-a-fait-accompli-over-asbestos-site|work=Rochdale Online|date=2008-10-15|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="johnson"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turners site is taken off plan|last1=Johnson|first1=Helen|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/1190932_turners_site_is_taken_off_plan|date=2010-01-29|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kidd /&gt; The developer subsequently submitted a planning application to [[Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale|Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council]] in December 2004 to build an "urban village" consisting of 650 homes, a children's daycare centre and a business park on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The story so far ...|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/503978_the_story_so_far_|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2005-09-14|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planning application summary claimed: "of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination".&lt;ref name="kidd"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/sep/28/communities.freedomofinformation|title=Homes to die for|last1=Kidd|first1=Marie-Claire|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2005-09-28|accessdate=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, asbestos containing materials were abundantly visible on the ground, and local residents claimed that there were numerous asbestos dumping sites across the area, and that the woodland there had been heavily contaminated with asbestos dust.&lt;ref name=kidd /&gt; Site clearance work had begun as early as May 2004, prior to the submission of the application, including tree felling and soil disturbance, and some waste had been removed on flatbed trailers and open trucks.&lt;ref name=kidd /&gt; In September 2005 MMC admitted that the woods were significantly contaminated with asbestos.&lt;ref name=kidd /&gt;

A campaign group, Save Spodden Valley, was formed to oppose the development, claiming disturbance of the site in a contaminated state posed too great a risk to public health.&lt;ref name="dorsett"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dorsett|first1=Bethan|title=Legal threat over Turner site clean-up|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/521047_legal_threat_over_turner_site_cleanup|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2006-12-12|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater Manchester Association of Trade Unions Councils said: "The planners must do their public duty and deem the site permanently unsafe for urban development and formulate a plan to seal all possible sources of asbestos dust as an urgent priority."&lt;ref name="unions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Unions: It's time to scrap Turner's housing plans|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/1066787_unions_its_time_to_scrap_turners_housing_plans|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2008-09-13|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial planning application was placed on hold in 2005, and Richard Butler, [[Planning committee|Principal Planning Officer]] for Rochdale Borough Council said in October 2008: "The application has not yet been determined and is suspended whilst the applicants and their consultants, together with our own contamination experts, assess a number of issues, the most important being the asbestos risk and the remediation required as part of the redevelopment." In December 2009, despite no decontamination work having been carried out, the council earmarked the site for 568 houses, based on a housing density of 30 dwellings per hectare, in a draft allocation of future [[brownfield land]] targets.&lt;ref name="core"&gt;{{cite web|title=TBA asbestos site - more shocking council documents...|url=http://www.rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/21/spodden-valley/33950/tba-asbestos-site-more-shocking-council-documents|work=Rochdale Online|date=2009-12-11|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010, however, the council deleted references to the redevelopment of the site. Simon Danzcuk, the Rochdale [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] [[Prospective parliamentary candidate|parliamentary candidate]], has warned that the council believe a housing development on the site is an inevitability and that they are "sleepwalking into a catastrophic mistake."&lt;ref name=simms /&gt; MMC have stated that "there is no viable alternative to development led remediation of the site."&lt;ref name=simms /&gt; A National Health and Safety Commissioner who was formerly a Health and Safety Manager at the factory has said that the felling of trees and disturbing of soil on the site is "sheer madness... With the potential amount of asbestos on that site, no development should be built on this land."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spodden-valley.co.uk/index.htm|title=Save Spodden Valley|work=Save Spodden Valley|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre has said: "Asbestos is a [[carcinogen]] and it causes lung diseases. When asbestos gets into the air and can be inhaled by people it can cause those diseases 10, 20, 50 years down the line. So if there is any development on that site there is a potential for serious lung diseases, cancers and death from that development."&lt;ref name="landmark"&gt;{{cite web|title=Landmark High Court decision parallels for Spodden Valley|url=http://rochdaleonline.co.uk/news-features/2/news/27669/landmark-high-court-decision-parallels-for-spodden-valley|date=2009-07-30|work=RochdaleOnline|accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spokesman Jason Addy of Save Spodden Valley, stated: "The key issue is contamination.

==Background==
The manufacture of asbestos products began on the site in 1879, and by 1970 the factory had an annual output of 2,250,000 yards of asbestos cloth and {{convert|5500000|mi|km}} of asbestos yarn. The dangerous nature of asbestos fibres had first been suspected in 1898, when Factory Inspector [[Lucy Deane Streatfeild|Lucy Deane]] reported: "The evil effects of asbestos dust have also instigated a microscopic examination of the mineral dust by HM Medical Inspector [Thomas Legge]. Clearly revealed was the sharp glass-like jagged nature of the particles, and where they are allowed to rise and to remain suspended in the air of the room in any quantity, the effects have been found to be injurious as might have been expected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ingenious.org.uk/site.asp?s=RM&amp;Param=1&amp;SubParam=3&amp;Content=1&amp;ArticleID={BD1A5756-8E06-48E8-A97D-2E51516EFC63}&amp;ArticleID2={E92660FA-C8C0-47B7-8127-1B93C9EAB99F}&amp;MenuLinkID={572899CC-5087-423B-A31F-DF9C44BE1092}|title=Lucy Deane, Lady Inspector of Factories|work=Ingenious.org.uk|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Magic Mineral to Killer Dust: Turner &amp; Newall and the Asbestos Hazard|last=Tweedale|first=Geoffrey|year=2001|publisher=OUP|location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-924399-0|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1924 a 33-year-old Turner's employee, [[Nellie Kershaw]], became the first officially recognised victim of [[asbestosis]] but the firm refused to accept responsibility for her death, saying it would "create a precedent".&lt;ref name="sommerlad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sommerlad|first1=Nick|title=How Turner &amp; Newall condemned its workers to an agonising death|url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/asbestos-campaign/2009/03/how-turner-newell-condemned-it.html|work=[[The Daily Mirror]]|date=2009-03-14|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her family received no compensation, and she was buried in a pauper's grave in Rochdale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asbestos deaths memorial unveiled |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4952440.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-05-27|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Turner's director Robert H. Turner wrote: "All asbestos fibre dust is a danger to lungs. If we can produce evidence from this country that the industry is not responsible for any asbestosis claims, we may be able to avoid tiresome regulations and the introduction of dangerous occupational talk."&lt;ref name=sommerlad /&gt; Despite an awareness of the potentially lethal effects of asbestos, the factory site remained heavily contaminated: measurements taken in 1950 and again in 1957 showed levels of asbestos dust in the air outside the factory roof were between 18 and 60 particles per cubic centimetre - far above the company's own safe working level of 2 to 3 particles, while a measurement taken near houses outside the factory premises was 47 particles.&lt;ref name=sommerlad /&gt; In August 1957, Turner's revealed that they were dumping 15,000&amp;nbsp;lb (6.8 tonnes) of asbestos dust recovered from ventilation filters alone each week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spodden-valley.co.uk/1957_confidential_document.htm|title=Confidential Document|work=Save Spodden Valley|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same document reported that the levels of asbestos dust on the factory's roof exceeded those in the actual production areas inside the factory. In the 1950s people living near the factory joked that the area had frost all year round and the local woods were nicknamed "the snow trees" due to the permanent dusting with asbestos particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Asbetos: The lies that killed|last=Howker|first=Ed|work=[[New Statesman]]|location=London|volume=137|issue=4912|date=1 September 2008|pages=22–24, 26|id=[[ProQuest]] document ID 224336829}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 a letter to Turner's directors from solicitors James Chapman &amp; Co admitted: "We have over the years been able to talk our way out of claims or compromise for comparatively small amounts, but we have always recognised that at some stage solicitors of experience would, with the advance in medical knowledge and the development of the law, recognise there is no real defence to these claims and take us to trial."&lt;ref name=sommerlad /&gt; By the mid-1970s however the number of asbestos-related deaths began to increase steadily and from 1980 onwards the asbestos market began to decline dramatically.&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/community/rochdale_150/work/s/510/510671_global_empire_of_crown_jewel_left_town_bitter_legacy.html|title=Global empire of crown jewel left town bitter legacy|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2006-03-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908055539/http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/community/rochdale_150/work/s/510/510671_global_empire_of_crown_jewel_left_town_bitter_legacy.html|archivedate=8 September 2008|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 the company posted losses of [[Pound sterling|£]]30million, including compensation payouts of [[Pound sterling|£]]6million.&lt;ref name=sommerlad /&gt; In 1998, with 263,000 claims for industrial injury pending, Turner's was bought by [[Federal-Mogul]]. In 2001, Federal-Mogul filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos-related claims amounting to [[US Dollar|$]]351million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/334298_jobs_threatened_by_site_sale|title=Jobs threatened by site sale|date=2004-02-13|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom the business went into administration in October 2001 leaving a pension fund deficit estimated at [[Pound sterling|£]]400 million. UK victims of the company's asbestos pollution were offered only a fraction of the compensation to which they were entitled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/Asbestos-victims39-cutprice-payouts.1629050.jp|title=Asbestos victims' cut-price payouts|date=14 July 2006|work=[[Yorkshire Evening Post]]|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weaving and asbestos producing areas of the Spodden Valley site were subsequently demolished in 2001.&lt;ref name=global /&gt;

==Land purchase==
MMC Estates and Rathbone Jersey Limited purchased the site in May 2004, and said: "Any successful regeneration must find alternative uses and following discussions with the council, the site was defined as an 'area of opportunity' for a mixed use 'urban village' type development, comprising primarily employment and residential development supported by an appropriate level of ancillary uses. This will be supported by an environmental impact statement. MMC is a local developer responsible for the sympathetic council-backed regeneration of other sites within the borough, and has commenced some clearance works involving the felling of trees which are not protected by tree preservation orders."&lt;ref name="chop"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|title=Residents fear that wildlife will get the chop|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/344/344647_residents_fear_that_wildlife_will_get_the_chop.html|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2004-05-21|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Rochdale Council Draft Unitary Development Plan published earlier in the year had accepted that "the whole site is contaminated as a result of the industrial processes carried out there" and Administrators of Turner's considered the site "an asset of dubious value, (possibly even a liability)." The Administrators also stated that if mesothelioma or [[asbestos]]-related cancer deaths arose from any future development on the site, the liability for this would rest with the new owners and developers of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spodden-valley.co.uk/timeline.htm|title=Timeline/Speech given by Anthony Coombs, Member of the T&amp;N Creditors Committee, John Pickering &amp; Partners|work=Save Spodden Valley|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree felling===
Between May 13–14, 2004 the site was enclosed with temporary mesh fencing and plain-clothed security guards commenced patrols of the public areas. At 02:00 on May 15 [[bulldozer]]s arrived at the site and [[Felling|tree-felling]] began at 07:00.&lt;ref name="recent"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spodden-valley.co.uk/timeline.htm|title=Timeline/Recent actions by the new owners of the site|work=Save Spodden Valley|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work caused immediate concern to nearby residents who feared the work might unsettle asbestos deposits in the ground.&lt;ref name=chop /&gt; Residents formed the Save Spodden Valley action group the following week. Residents also protested to Rochdale Council, which subsequently issued an emergency tree preservation order on six parts of the site, preventing the removal of trees without permission of planning officers, and carrying a fine of up to [[Pound sterling|£]]20,000 per tree.&lt;ref name="tree"&gt;{{cite web|last=Haslam|first=Dale|title=Tree fellers cut down by council|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/345/345388_tree_fellers_cut_down_by_council.html|date=2004-10-29|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Health and Safety Executive]] (HSE) also secured a voluntary arrangement to halt any work that could disturb soil on the site pending soil sampling.&lt;ref name=recent /&gt; Former Turner's employees and local residents claimed that, as recently as the 1960s, asbestos dust and fibres were clearly visible hanging from the trees, and that a disused coalmine shaft exposed by the tree felling had been used over a period of decades to dump hundreds of tonnes of asbestos waste.&lt;ref name="probe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/345/345195_call_to_probe_every_inch_of_asbestos_site.html|title=Call to probe 'every inch' of asbestos site|last=Appleton|first=Dave|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2004-09-17|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Rochdale's Chernobyl"===
In November 2004 Rochdale councillor Tom Stott, a former employee at Turner's, warned that any development of the site could be an environmental disaster, and that there could be so much asbestos waste in the ground that serious disturbance could lead to "Rochdale's [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]]."&lt;ref name="chernobyl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/345518_this_could_be_our_chernobyl|title=‘This could be our Chernobyl’|date=2004-11-30|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also expressed concern that the developers would be allowed by the council to carry out their own contamination survey to determine whether the site was fit for development, which was confirmed by the council: "Any developers would have to provide a full environmental assessment of the site as part of their planning application. The council wouldn't be doing any surveys of its own because it doesn't have the expertise or the resources to do this."&lt;ref name=chernobyl /&gt;

===Urban village plans===
In December 2004 plans were submitted, in partnership with Countryside Properties, to build an 'urban village' over two-thirds of the site, comprising residential and business developments, a retail site and doctor's surgery. MMC director Mark Russell stated that the plans were in 'everyone's interests' and would be carried out without harming the environment or causing problems with old asbestos: "At the end of the day this is a contaminated site with lots of old, ugly, dilapidated buildings on and it needs something doing with it. It is in everyone's interests that this happens. There is not any danger of asbestos."&lt;ref name="plans"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/345/345598_turners_plans_leave_campaigners_furious.html|title=Turner’s plans leave campaigners furious|date=2004-12-17|accessdate=2010-04-18|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planning application summary claimed: "of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination".&lt;ref name=kidd /&gt; A report submitted by the developers said only one out of the 86 soil tests they carried out showed any traces of asbestos dust, and that traces of [[lead]] and [[copper]] were more prevalent on the site.&lt;ref name="tests"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/345/345625_call_for_more_tests_after_asbestos_claim.html|title=Call for more tests after asbestos claim|date=2004-12-29|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A working party of six councillors expressed concern that many areas on the {{convert|72|acre|m2|adj=on}} site might have been unchecked, however, and Councillor Elwyn Watkins said that he had personally observed asbestos containing materials hanging on trees when he joined campaigners on the north side of the site.&lt;ref name=tests /&gt; Heavy winds in January 2005 felled several trees, revealing asbestos-like fibres on the exposed roots. Residents eventually had the waste tested themselves at an independent laboratory where it was confirmed to be [[Asbestos#Brown|Amosite]] ("brown asbestos"), the most hazardous of the asbestos minerals because of its long persistence in the lungs of exposed people.&lt;ref name="amosite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spodden-valley.co.uk/beforeandafter.htm|title=Exposed asbestos in the Spodden Valley|work=Save Spodden Valley|accessdate=19 July 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060630153129/http://www.spodden-valley.co.uk/beforeandafter.htm|archivedate=30 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sampling controversy==
In April 2005, following the confirmation of asbestos fibres found on tree roots, the council asked developers to provide more detailed information relating to their contaminated land surveys, and placed the application on hold. They also announced that they were considering appointing their own environmental consultants to examine the site. Jason Addy said: "This is what we have been asking for since day one. The information handed in with the planning application was inaccurate, misleading and avoided many issues. As this site begins to reveal more of its murky secrets people are realising just how contaminated it is. We are very concerned about the asbestos contamination on the site. We are very worried about the way this is going, if it wasn't so serious it would be a farce."&lt;ref name="hold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/345/345997_turners_plans_are_put_on_hold.html|title=Turner’s plans are put on hold|last=Bottomley|first=Robert|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2005-04-01|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rochdale councillor [[Wera Hobhouse#Personal life|William Hobhouse]] said: "With no government regulations specifying safe levels of asbestos in soil, it is clear the council, working with outside consultants, will have to formulate what percentage of asbestos in the soil is safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/346/346018_were_being_kept_in_dark_say_protesters.html|title=We’re being kept in dark, say protesters|last=Byrne|first=Michael|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2005-04-08|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land audit===
In May 2005 the Save Spodden Valley group claimed that it had uncovered internal MMC correspondence which identified numerous sites where asbestos fibres had been found in September 2004, predating the planning application. The document stated: "The audit undertaken was visual and no samples have been sent away for analysis. I enclose a site map where the asbestos has been located: Top section of road near hair pin bend, asbestos sheets and asbestos fibre found in tree stumps. Road leading to Healey Dell, asbestos cloth."&lt;ref name="letter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/500233_protesters_left_fuming_by_letter_revelations|title=Protesters left fuming by letter revelations|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2005-05-10|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers responded that they had been aware of contamination in the northern portion of the site, but their testing report submitted to the council did not include this area as there had been no intention to develop there. Instead they had confined their testing only to those areas where they intended to develop and that there had been "some misunderstanding of our intentions and the test result."&lt;ref name=letter /&gt;

===Health and Safety Executive tests===
HSE tests on building rubble carried out on the site in March 2005 were revealed in July 2005, and demonstrated the presence of significant contamination.&lt;ref name="rubble"&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrne|first=Michael|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/501478_mp_hits_out_at_ducking_and_diving_|title=MP hits out at ‘ducking and diving’|date=2005-07-01|accessdate=2010-04-18|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Rowen]] MP, the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] [[Member of Parliament]] for Rochdale, raised the issue and the results in a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate on 28 June 2005. He said: "At the request of residents, the Health and Safety Commission recently tested rubble from parts of the factory buildings on the site. Of the eight samples tested, three confirmed the existence of asbestos of up to 1%, which is 10 times higher than the proportion ensuring that waste is classed as special waste. Yet in his planning submission, the developer stated: "Of particular note is the absence of any asbestos contamination"; and in a meeting with local councillors earlier this year, he and his expert witness said that the tests on the rubble had all been negative. For the past 10 months, open wagons have been transporting that rubble around the borough to unknown places, and subject to no control... This case involves a development costing up to £100 million for which the developer has so far paid Rochdale Council a £5,500 planning application fee. For that, the council is expected to carry out all the checks and controls to ensure that the developer is acting honourably."&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo050628/halltext/50628h05.htm|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 28 June 2005 (pt 5)|date=2005-06-28|work=[[Hansard#Hansard in the United Kingdom|Hansard]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encia Environmental report===
In August 2005 a second report commissioned by the developers, from Encia Environmental, revealed levels of asbestos fibres in two soil samples from the site at 1.3% and 2.3%,  13 and 23 times above the limit at which waste is deemed "hazardous".&lt;ref name="unsafe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/502921_unsafe_asbestos_levels_discovered|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|title=Unsafe asbestos levels discovered|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2005-08-16|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A level of 3% is categorised as "toxic".&lt;ref name="warnings"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/503895_new_warnings_over_asbestos_levels|title=New warnings over asbestos levels|date=2005-09-13|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the developers earlier assertions that they had not intended to develop the controversial northern section, council planning officer Ken Smith claimed that the developers had been told they would have to submit a planning application for the whole of the {{convert|72|acre|m2|adj=on}} site, which would have to show any asbestos tests and plans for removal, and not just selected portions. "They were clearly told remediation work must take place on the whole of the site," he said. "It's been quite clear it was 72 acres and not [just] part of that site."&lt;ref name=warnings /&gt;

===Significant contamination===
MMC Estates and Countryside Properties subsequently released statements in September 2005 acknowledging that there was significant contamination on the site. Michael Drogan, director of MMC, said: "Following the completion of investigations, which have now been published, we recognise there is significant asbestos contamination in areas of the woodland and have evidence of pockets of contamination in other parts of the site."&lt;ref name="concerns"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/504141_asbestos_concerns_very_real_firms_finally_admit|title=Asbestos concerns 'very real', firms finally admit|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|date=2005-09-21|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rochdale councillor Tom Stott responded: "In their initial reports they said there was little contamination. Now it is 'significant'. I am shocked that it has taken so long for the companies to admit what we have known for over 12 months."&lt;ref name=concerns /&gt;

===Advertising Standards Authority non-broadcast adjudication===
A brochure produced by MMC and Countryside Properties, entitled ''Regeneration of Spodden Valley Community News Autumn 2005'', and distributed to 50,000 households in the area, was determined by the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) to have breached a code of honesty and truthfulness, and was misleading when it claimed:
*piles of crushed rubble at the site were "free" of asbestos
*a level of 0.01% asbestos was "safe"&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Complaints-and-ASA-action/Adjudications/2006/5/Countryside-Properties/CS_41245.aspx|title=ASA Non-broadcast Adjudication: Countryside Properties|date=2006-05-03|work=[[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ASA advised MMC to "take greater care when producing marketing communications in future", and "to ensure that they held full substantation before making similar claims."&lt;ref name=asa /&gt;

===Atkins Global report===
The report commissioned from Atkins Global by Rochdale council, at a cost of £80,000, was published in July 2006 and claimed that previous tests on the land, carried out on behalf of the developers, were not thorough enough, and that extensive work would be required before councillors should even consider the controversial planning application. Atkins Global also claimed that the majority of the developers' tests did not detect the true levels of asbestos in the soil.&lt;ref name="atkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/515583_asbestos_survey_damns_tba_site|title=Asbestos survey damns TBA site|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|date=2006-07-25|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that "the presence of asbestos cannot be ruled out across much of the site." In June 2007, Countryside Properties withdrew from the joint planning application.&lt;ref name="countryside"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/528890_shock_as_turners_company_pulls_out|title=Shock as Turner's company pulls out|date=2007-06-09|last=Dorsett|first=Bethan|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMC released a statement saying: "Countryside Properties Ltd has withdrawn from the planning application for a mixed use scheme on the former Turner Brothers site because they became disillusioned with the apparent unwillingness of the town planning department to deal with the application as a result of the ill-founded and negative publicity generated by Jason Addy's campaign. The people of Rochdale should keep in mind that the site owners have not caused the contamination problems on the site. This was inherited from Federal Mogul... If we were to cave in to Jason Addy's uninformed scaremongering and let him have his way, which we most certainly won't, the site would remain a contaminated eyesore on the face of Rochdale in eternity, and all the surrounding houses and properties will be devalued by his badly thought out obsession."&lt;ref name="scaremonger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/528925_turners_site_developers_call_for_public_support|title=Turner’s site developers call for public support|last=Appleton|first=Dave|date=2007-06-12|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|accessdate=2010-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, the site remains undeveloped and no significant remediation or decontamination work has been undertaken.

==Implications of the Corby Ruling==
The ruling in the [[Corby toxic waste case]], delivered in July 2009, found Corby Borough Council [[Public liability|liable]] in [[negligence]], [[public nuisance]] and a [[Tort#Statutory torts|breach of statutory duty]] for its reclamation of a steel works and the resulting atmospheric contamination. The case against the council cited: "The Defendant's urban land reclamation programme and the presence of poisonous waste presented a significant risk to health. The poisonous waste was ultra hazardous and various sites contained substantial quantities of contaminated waste and toxic materials that were likely to cause personal injuries to persons in the surrounding area in the event of their escape." While recognising that there was insufficient [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] data to establish whether the victims' injuries arose from a "common cause", or from airborne contamination or from the reclamation works, the judge ruled that there was a "statistically significant cluster" of birth defects in [[Corby]] which needed "explanation other than chance": it was not the court's purpose to establish whether the victims were individually exposed to contaminants from the reclamation, rather to determine whether any relevant breach of duty had the ability to cause injuries of the type complained of.&lt;ref name="implications"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eversheds.com/uk/home/articles/index1.page?ArticleID=templatedata\Eversheds\articles\data\en\Local_government\Local_Government_briefing_note_30_2009|title=Briefing Note - The Corby Ruling and the Implications for Local Authorities|work=Eversheds LLP|date=2009-08-19|accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also ruled that it was "reasonably foreseeable that the local population might be exposed to hazardous or contaminated substances" as a result of the council's clean-up programme.&lt;ref name="fallout"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/environment-natural-resources/land-use-development/12672076-1.html|title=Fall Out|date=2009-08-17|work=AllBusiness.com/Regeneration and Renewal|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Townsend, head of the environmental practice at Allen &amp; Overy, says: "One of the important lessons from the case is that because of the rapidly evolving nature of environmental science and advancing knowledge and techniques, it will no longer be possible for developers to hide behind the science. To claim that you didn’t know is now unacceptable.".&lt;ref name="soup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article6739140.ece|title=Corby 'toxic soup' case: why it's a long way from being over|work=[[The Times]]|last=Fennell|first=Edward|date=2009-08-06|accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Matthew, a partner in the project group at corporate law firm Nabarro, advises: "Councils and regeneration bodies still need to be very open and clear about how they intend to deal with material on brownfield sites. Councils need to take professional advice... Don't leave a gaping hole for any future class actions."&lt;ref name=fallout /&gt;

Following the Corby ruling, Jason Addy stated: "The Corby ruling could have huge implications for the actions and responsibilities of Rochdale Council for the Spodden Valley site. Environmental pollution has been a problem at the Rochdale factory with acknowledged cases of asbestos-related cancer caused by environmental exposure."&lt;ref name="wilkinson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rochdaleobserver.co.uk/news/s/1129268_court_ruling_could_have_spodden_valley_implications|title=Court ruling could have Spodden Valley implications|last=Wilkinson|first=Damon|work=[[Rochdale Observer]]|date=2009-08-01|accessdate=2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurie Kazan Allen, Editor of the British Asbestos Newsletter, said: "This landmark decision has ramifications for Rochdale Council regarding the Spodden Valley asbestos factory site. There is now a clear legal principle that local authorities hold a duty of care to protect communities from the hazardous effects of disturbing contaminated land. Since at least the 1960s there has been clear evidence that the inhalation of asbestos fibres, even in low quantities, can cause terminal cancer decades after initial exposure. Rochdale Council must take heed of this historic decision and act to protect local people."&lt;ref name=landmark /&gt;

Hilda Palmer of the Greater Manchester Hazards Centre said: "This has serious implications for Rochdale MBC in its management and control of the ex T&amp;N site. The site is known to be extensively contaminated with the known carcinogen asbestos, which may be released into the air whenever the site is disturbed, and the invisible microscopic fibres spread in the air across the area to be inhaled by people, including children who are especially at risk of developing asbestos related terminal cancers such as mesothelioma years later. These facts are not in dispute and though the owner of the site is the responsible duty holder, the court judgment on Corby Council confirms the duty of care of a council as the planning authority and environmental health authority in terms of managing and controlling the risks to long term health presented by the airborne asbestos fibres from this site."&lt;ref name=landmark /&gt;

{{Nihongo|'''Suruga Sanatorium'''|国立駿河療養所}} or '''National Suruga Sanatorium''' is a national [[sanatorium]] for [[leprosy]] and ex-leprosy patients situated in [[Gotemba, Shizuoka]], [[Japan]] since 1945.

==History==
After the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937- ),  wounded soldiers became problematic and [[Matsuki Miyazaki]] proposed in 1937 that those who developed [[leprosy]], during military service, should be given treatment and pension in the same degree as those who developed [[tuberculosis]] during service.&lt;ref&gt;War and leprosy (1948), Miyazaki M. Repura 17,1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The following is a timeline of events:
*1940: Treatment for leprosy in Japanese soldiers was approved.
*1942: A sanatorium was planned and National Sanatorium Wounded Soldiers' Suruga Sanatorium was established on December 15, 1944.
*December 15, 1944: Sanatorium opened.
*June 10, 1945: The first patient was hospitalized.  
*December 1, 1945: The facility became National Suruga Sanatorium. 
*April 1996: The 1953 Leprosy Prevention Law was abolished.
*July 1998: The trial for compensation started.
*May 11, 2001: The trial for compensation ruled that the previous Leprosy Prevention was [[unconstitutional]].
*May 25, 2001: The trial for compensation was confirmed. The compensation of 8,000,000 [[yen]] to 14,000,000 yen was given to patients depending on the duration of their incarceration.

'''The Clean Air Campaign''' is a [[not-for-profit]] organization that motivates [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgians]] to take action to improve [[air quality index|air quality]] and reduce traffic congestion. The organization was formed in 1996 by government, business, civic, health, environmental and educational organizations to address traffic congestion and air quality issues in the metro Atlanta region.

Until 2014, The Clean Air Campaign received 80 percent of its funding from U.S. Department of Transportation Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program funds. Today, The Clean Air Campaign secures private funding through corporate and foundation grants to deploy demand management programs and services to employers, commuters and schools.

== Public education ==
[[File:Commute Comparison.jpg|thumb|Traffic with 73 solo drivers vs. traffic with 73 commuters using commute alternatives including bus, carpool and vanpool.]]
The Clean Air Campaign was formed in 1996 following an initiative by Atlanta business, civic, environmental and political leaders which led to less traffic and air pollution during the 1996 Olympics. The non-profit organization, which celebrated its 15th anniversary in the summer of 2011, fulfills its education efforts today through mass advertising, public relations and community outreach.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.smartbusinessblog.biz/the-magazine/from-the-staff/456-cleaning-up-atlantas-air|title=Cleaning up Atlanta’s air|publisher=Smart Business|date=August 2011|accessdate=August 16, 2011|first=Kristy|last=O'hara}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their education efforts are part of a statewide strategic approach to improve mobility and air quality, bringing public and private sector interests together.

== Employer rewards programs ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Transportation Fair.jpg|thumb|250px|Transit fair at an Atlanta area employer.]] --&gt;
The Clean Air Campaign works with employers in the region, given that high concentrations of employees commuting to a common destination during peak travel periods are a high-value audience for their programs. According to a 2010 survey conducted by the Center for Transportation and the Environment on behalf of the Georgia Department of Transportation, 82 percent of metro Atlanta commuters drive alone to and from work. .&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/telecommuting-now-metro-areas-850677.html|title=Telecommuting Now Metro Area's Main Alternative to Driving Solo|publisher=Atlanta Journal Constitution|date=February 2011|accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater means and resources of employers versus individual commuters opens up a broader range of solutions to their commute issues.

===Employer partnership program===
The Clean Air Campaign's principal method of engaging employers is through their general Employer Partnership Program.  Campaign experts design a commute alternative program tailored to the specific needs of the employer based on workforce size, operating hours, office access to public transit and an array of other factors.

Campaign staff are then able to assist the employer with employee outreach through programs such as onsite "transportation fairs," educational sessions and assistance in taking advantage of available alternative commute incentives.

===Alternative work arrangement consulting===
The Clean Air Campaign develops alternative work arrangements typically to augment an alternative commute program.  Telework, compressed work weeks and [[flextime#Flextime in the United States|flextime]] are all viable options employed to reduce the number of instances in which employees must commute to work during peak traffic hours or inclement weather conditions.  This element of The Clean Air Campaign's program is unique in that it aims to assist with business continuity planning as much as transportation demand management and air pollution mitigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ajc.com/business/don-t-sweat-the-269522.html|title=Don't sweat the snow, work from home|publisher=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program has also proved critical to employers whose workforces are affected by Atlanta's frequent road and highway closures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://atlanta.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2008/12/01/focus15.html|title=Commuters finding alternative ways to work|publisher=The Atlanta Business Chronicle|date=November 28, 2008|accessdate=March 4, 2010|first=Randy|last=Southerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The One Ton Challenge==
[[File:OneTonPollutionBalloon.jpg|thumb|250px|A Clean Air Campaign promotion utilizing an exhaust-cloud shaped balloon.]]
The One Ton Challenge is a statewide effort to encourage commuters to use a commute alternative.  By tying a measurable and easily understandable amount of impact on the environment (one [[ton]] of atmospheric pollutants conserved) to a clear and consistent call to action (one alternative commute to work per week) this challenge attempts to provide a more tangible, less abstract illustration of the environmental benefits provided by alternative commute options.

The challenge derives from the fact that an individual commuter in metro Atlanta is capable of eliminating a full ton of atmospheric pollutants simply by using an alternative commuting method once per week. The average round-trip commute distance in Atlanta is 40 miles.&lt;ref&gt;''Metro Atlanta’s 2007 State of the Commute''. (n.d.) Center for Transportation and the Environment.&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that one pound of atmospheric pollution is emitted per mile driven in a conventional vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/TechnicalGuidelines_March2006.pdf|title=Technical Guidelines Voluntary Reporting of Greenhouse Gases (1605(b)) Program|date=March 2006|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.epa.gov/otaq/fetrends.htm|title=Light-Duty Automotive Technology and Fuel Economy Trends: 1975 Through 2007|date=September 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By eliminating one commute per week, or roughly 52 commutes per year, the average Atlantan would keep 2,080&amp;nbsp;lbs., or slightly over one ton, of pollution out of the air.

Over 3,600 commuters participated in the challenge in 2008, the program's first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Is Atlanta smog better or worse? Tips for coping.|publisher=Examiner.com|date=May 15, 2009|accessdate=March 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clean Air Schools program==
[[File:Clean Air Schools Sign.JPG|thumb|left|150px|A Clean Air Schools sign designates a no-idle zone at a Georgia elementary school.]]
In 2004, The Clean Air Campaign introduced Clean Air Schools, an education outreach program that engages the entire school community in improving air quality. Initially offered to a select group of elementary schools in the 20-county metro Atlanta region, the program was expanded in 2008 to include middle and high schools statewide and the name changed to Clean Air Schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cleanaircampaign.org/For-the-Press/Press-Kit/Education-Program-Fact-Sheet|title=Education Program Fact Sheet|publisher=The Clean Air Campaign|accessdate=February 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the Clean Air Schools program focuses on two teen-targeted programs: Get There Green, a high school transportation planning challenge, and OnAir, a clean air site (www.blogonair.org) and social media initiative that rewards teens with 'AirCreds' for taking clean transportation modes and completing other air-friendly tasks.

The '''World Association for Sexual Health''' ('''WAS''') is an international umbrella organization representing sexological societies and [[sexologists]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/68893.php Eli Coleman Was Honored By The World Association For Sexual Health]. ''Medical News Today''. Retrieved on October 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1978 in Rome, Italy, the WAS main goal is to promote sexual health for all through sexological science. Since its beginning, the WAS has successfully sponsored 19 international congresses, the last one being held in [[Gothenburg]], Sweden, from June 21 to June 25, 2009. The WAS was previously named '''World Association for Sexology''', but changed its name in order to stress that [[sexology]] is a tool for achieving sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226224828/http://www.worldsexology.org/about.asp|title=World Association for Sexual Health - About the WAS|date=February 26, 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Member societies ==
Five prominent Regional Continental Federations are members of the WAS:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514075845/http://www.worldsexology.org/membership_soc.asp|title=World Association for Sexual Health - Membership|date=May 14, 2009|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=September 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Asia and Oceania Federation of Sexology (AOFS), the European Federation of Sexology (EFS), the Latin American Federation of Sexology and Sexual Education (FLASSES), the North American Federation of Sexuality Organizations (NAFSO), and the African Federation for Sexual Health and Rights (AFSHR).

WAS members also include more than 100 national and international sexological organizations, institutes and foundations. Among the sexological societies belonging to WAS, we can find: the [[International Academy of Sex Research]], the [[Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States]] (SIECUS), the [[Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality]] (SSSS), the [[Society for the Advancement of Sexual Health]], [[South Asia Institute for Human Sexuality]] (SAIHS), the [[American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors, &amp; Therapists]] (AASECT) and the [[World Professional Association for Transgender Health]] (WPATH).

The theme of the 2010 World Sexual Health Day was "Let's talk about it... an intergenerational discussion", thus, activities around the world had the objective of creating dialogue between youth and adults about sexual health.
