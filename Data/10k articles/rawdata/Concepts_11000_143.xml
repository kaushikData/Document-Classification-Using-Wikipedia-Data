      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8284">'''Abuse during childbirth''' (or '''obstetric violence''') is the [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]] and lack of respect during [[childbirth]]. This treatment is regarded as a violation of the [[woman's rights]]. It also has the affect of preventing women from seeking [[pre-natal care]] and using other health care services.&lt;ref name = who1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/maternal_perinatal/statement-childbirth/en/|title=Prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during childbirth|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse during childbirth is one form of [[violence against women]].

Investigations into the prevalence of these practices have been conducted by the [[World Health Organization]]. Their studies demonstrate that this is a global problem. Women experience disrespectful, abusive or neglectful treatment during their childbirth when the birth occurs in medical and health facilities. The abusive relationship and trust between women and health providers can create a great reluctance to obtain medical assistance during birth. Disrespectful and abusive treatment can be experienced during pregnancy. During childbirth, a woman is very vulnerable and cannot protect herself. The results of this abuse can have very negative consequences for the infant and the mother.&lt;ref name = who2&gt;{{cite web | url = http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/134588/1/WHO_RHR_14.23_eng.pdf?ua=1&amp;ua=1 | title = The prevention and elimination of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth | accessdate = 3 August 2017 | publisher = World Health organization }}&lt;/ref&gt;

WHO has found situations and circumstances where health facilities have participated in physical abuse, the withholding of pain medication, disrespect, humiliation, lack of confidentiality, lack of privacy, lack of informed consent, forced sterilization, refusing to be admitted to the facility, neglect during the birth, involuntary medical procedures, lack of confidentiality, withholding medical information and detention of the women at the facility because she is unable to pay the facility. In addition, the neglect during childbirth has resulted in life-threatening complications that could have responded to appropriate medical intervention.&lt;ref name= who2/&gt;

Some women are more likely to experience abuse during childbirth. [[Adolescent]]s, [[Immigration|migrant]] women, women infected with [[HIV]], and [[ethnic minority]] women are more likely than others to receive abuse.&lt;ref name = who2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Disrespect and Abuse During Childbirth in Tanzania: Are Women Living With HIV More Vulnerable?|first1=David|last1=Sando|first2=Tamil|last2=Kendall|first3=Goodluck|last3=Lyatuu|first4=Hannah|last4=Ratcliffe|first5=Kathleen|last5=McDonald|first6=Mary|last6=Mwanyika-Sando|first7=Faida|last7=Emil|first8=Guerino|last8=Chalamilla|first9=Ana|last9=Langer|date=1 December 2014|publisher=|journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes|volume=67|issue=Suppl 4|pages=S228–S234|accessdate=|doi=10.1097/QAI.0000000000000378|pmid=25436822|pmc=4251905}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth in a low-income country|first1=Innocent I.|last1=Okafor|first2=Emmanuel O.|last2=Ugwu|first3=Samuel N.|last3=Obi|date=1 February 2015|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics|volume=128|issue=2|pages=110–113|accessdate=|doi=10.1016/j.ijgo.2014.08.015|pmid=25476154}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Association Between Disrespect and Abuse During Childbirth and Women's Confidence in Health Facilities in Tanzania|first1=Stephanie|last1=Kujawski|first2=Godfrey|last2=Mbaruku|first3=Lynn P.|last3=Freedman|first4=Kate|last4=Ramsey|first5=Wema|last5=Moyo|first6=Margaret E.|last6=Kruk|date=1 October 2015|publisher=|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|volume=19|issue=10|pages=2243–2250|accessdate=|doi=10.1007/s10995-015-1743-9|pmid=25990843}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Community and health system intervention to reduce disrespect and abuse during childbirth in Tanga Region, Tanzania: A comparative before-and-after study|first1=Stephanie A.|last1=Kujawski|first2=Lynn P.|last2=Freedman|first3=Kate|last3=Ramsey|first4=Godfrey|last4=Mbaruku|first5=Selemani|last5=Mbuyita|first6=Wema|last6=Moyo|first7=Margaret E.|last7=Kruk|date=1 July 2017|publisher=|journal=PLOS Medicine|volume=14|issue=7|pages=e1002341|accessdate=|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002341|pmid=28700587|pmc=5507413}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003766.pub6 | title=Continuous support for women during childbirth | journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | last1 = Bohren | first1 = Meghan A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some sources refer to North American obstetricians and gynecologists, especially between the 1950s and 1980s, practicing what was called ''[[Husband stitch|the husband's stitch]]'': placing extra stitches in the woman's vagina after the episiotomy or natural tearing, supposedly to increase the husband's future sexual pleasure and often causing long-term pain and discomfort to the woman. However, there is no proof that such a practice was widespread in North America,&lt;ref name="doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dobbeleir | first1 = Julie M.L.C.L. | last2 = Landuyt | first2 = Koenraad Van | last3 = Monstrey | first3 = Stan J. | title = Aesthetic surgery of the female genitalia | journal = Seminars in Plastic Surgery | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 130&amp;ndash;141 | publisher = [[Thieme Medical Publishers|Thieme]] | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | pmc = 3312147 | date = May 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0031-1281482 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=22547970}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Northrup | first = Christiane | title = Women's bodies, women's wisdom: creating physical and emotional health and healing | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0HeP-60VkIgC | publisher = Bantam Books | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780553804836}}&lt;/ref&gt; but mentions of it frequently appear in studies about [[episiotomy]], also in other American countries such as Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Diniz | first1 = Simone G. | last2 = Chacham | first2 = Alessandra S. | title = "The Cut Above" and "the Cut Below'": the abuse of caesareans and episiotomy in São Paulo, Brazil | journal = [[Reproductive Health Matters]], special issue: Sexuality, Rights and Social Justice | volume = 12 | issue = 23 | pages = 100&amp;ndash;110 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1016/S0968-8080(04)23112-3 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1016/S0968-8080(04)23112-3 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS models''', also known as '''ASSA AIDS models''', are a series of [[mathematical model]]s developed to assist the actuarial profession and the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa]] in assessing and addressing the impact of the [[AIDS|HIV and AIDS]] epidemic in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm South Africa HIV AIDS Statistics and Actuarial Society of South Africa HIV/AIDS Models]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx Actuarial Society of South Africa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104031521/http://www.actuarialsociety.co.za/default.aspx |date=January 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The models have been developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm AIDS Committee Publications till date] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701024530/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/News-3139.htm |date=July 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|Society]] and the Center for Actuarial Research (CARe) at the [[University of Cape Town]] in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm ASSA AIDS Models] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313090613/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/Models-3145.htm |date=March 13, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Models ==
In 1996 the first and earliest version of ASSA AIDS model ASSA500 was developed by the [[AIDS|AIDS Committee]] of the [[Actuarial Society of South Africa|society]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/press-releases/2008-releases/researchers-estimate-lives-lost-delay-arv-drug-use-hivaids-south-africa.html Harvard School of Public Health Report on ASSA HIV AIDS Models ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm ASSA500 the first model of AIDS Committee] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601041036/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA500-3163.htm |date=June 1, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Red Ribbon.svg|100px|thumb|A red ribbon use as logo of ASSA AIDS Committee]] While the ASSA2008 model is the most recent version of ASSA AIDS and demographic model which was released in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm The ASSA2008 model the most recent model] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410192403/http://aids.actuarialsociety.org.za/ASSA2008-Model-3480.htm |date=April 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The models have assisted insurers and those insured to have fair and balanced insurance policies in a country ravaged by AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.actuarialsociety.org.za/Portals/1/Documents/fa4bedae-e09d-4ed6-a3aa-47f7a0369ff7.pdf{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cover.co.za/long-term-insurance/still-a-lot-of-life-in-life&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint task team of the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to estimate the impact of extending the life of AIDS patients.&lt;ref name=IMF&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=W_LcnKavtYgC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=ASSA%20AIDS%20model&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=ASSA%20AIDS%20model&amp;f=false|title= Post-Apartheid South Africa: The First Ten Years|accessdate=25 June 2012|author= Michael Nowak and Luca Antonio Ricci, eds|publisher= International Monetary Fund, 2006, p. 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASSA is one of only two models used in South Africa;&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; both are capable of making projections on the progression of the epidemic through an interaction of many factors. Four population risk groups are included, along with assumptions about sexual behaviour, rates of infection, conception rates, the median duration to mortality of those with HIV/AIDS, and the rates of transmission between mother and child.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; The impact of drug treatments at birth and while nursing, enhanced STD treatment, and risk avoidance is projected by a lower rate scenario&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; The model makes provisions for migration of the population, separate modeling of racial groups, and separate modeling of provincial populations.&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt;

A study by the South African National Department of Health and the Treasury used the ASSA model to project a positive result for the increased implementation of [[antiretroviral drug]]s (ARV) in the country,&lt;ref name=IMF/&gt; although their cost is a problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmg.org.za/report/20100504-public-hearings-provincial-departments-helath-under-spending-hospital Public Hearings with National Treasury, Department of Health on under-expenditure of Hospital Revitalisation, Comprehensive HIV and AIDS, and Forensic Pathology Grants]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andreas Heusser''' (born 1976) is a [[Swiss]] [[conceptual art]]ist and [[curator]], based in [[Zurich]] and [[Johannesburg]].

== Artistic approach ==
Andreas Heusser's artistic approach can be described as creating long-term fictional realities made from contemporary real-world patterns. The works react upon and interact with a specific [[cultural]] or [[political]] situation while being created within that context, with that particular [[audience]], and within the social space of [[everyday life]]. Andreas Heusser uses various media and skills in order to accomplish the aimed – often political – effects.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Philip Preding online&lt;/ref&gt; The works can be enacted at any site – in [[Art museum|galleries]] and [[museums]], on the internet, on the street, or even in remote areas.

== Exploration of Nothing ==
Since 2013, Andreas Heusser has devoted himself to the [[exploration]] of [[nothing]] in [[art]], [[philosophy]] and [[science]]. This has developed into the [[No Show Museum]], a museum dedicated to [[nothing]] and its various [[wikt:manifestations|manifestations]] throughout the [[history of art]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.noshowmuseum.com/ No Show Museum]", www.noshowmuseum.com&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's collection includes around 500 works and documents from over 150 international artists of the 20th and 21st centuries. The museum also has a mobile presentation space in a converted postal car.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/bellevue/Das-Nichts-ist-unser-aller-Horizont/story/25033531 Das Nichts ist unser aller Horizont]". Tages-Anzeiger (2015-05-27)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[No Show Museum]] started a world tour with the mission to spread nothing: The first stage led from July to October 2015 through Europe, staging around 30 exhibitions in 20 different countries, before the museum was arriving in Italy and participating at the 56th [[Biennale di Venezia|Venice Art Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, Juri; Zweifel, Stefan. "[https://biennials.ch/home/EventDetail.aspx?EventId=73 Pro Helvetia's platform to present the Swiss contributions to the Venice Biennials]". www.biennials.ch&lt;/ref&gt;
In the summer of 2016, the mobile museum was shipped from Europe to America: The 80-day exhibition tour led from New York to Canada, then to the West Coast of the U.S., and finally down to Baja California Sur, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Yale University Radio WYBCX: [http://museumofnonvisibleart.com/interviews/andreas-heusser/ The Art World Demystified]. Hosted by Brainard Carey&lt;/ref&gt; The third stage of the world tour took place from November 2017 to January 2018 and led from Mexico through the countries of Central America to Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrix Dargel: [http://www.deutsches-museum.de/fileadmin/Content/010_DM/060_Verlag/060_KuT/2018/KT1-2018/Dargel.pdf Nichts zu sehen!] In: Kultur &amp; Technik. Deutsches Museum (Hsg.). Edition 1/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum reproduces the typical [[structures]], mechanisms, [[rituals]] and [[strategies]] of established art institutions. As a result, the project becomes a model in which we can observe the contextual conditions that are required for the recognition of something (or nothing) as art. Implicit in the project, then, is the question: What is needed for a successful promotion and [[marketing]] of art?&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rts.ch/audio/la-1ere/programmes/forum/6397057-le-no-show-museum-le-musee-qui-n-a-rien-a-montrer-26-12-2014.html La musée qui n'a rien à montrer]". RTS.ch (2014-12-26)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Art Activism Projects ==
Between 2009 and 2011, Andreas Heusser produced a series of large scale [[projects]] that bridge the gap between art and [[activism]].  Designed to reach not only the art scene, but to achieve a political effect on the general public, those projects often took place outside of art institutions, and involved public [[interventions]], [[websites]], [[social media]], [[press releases]], and other forms of dissemination.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.kampagnenpraxis.de/reports/provokation-verbreitet-sich-im-internet/ Provokation verbreitet sich im Internet]". www.kampagnenpraxis.de.&lt;/ref&gt; Using methods like parody, satire, interventions, and tactical obfuscation, he created fake organizations and [[corporations]] (including [[counterfeiting]] sites, media [[hoaxes]] and artificial characters) through imitating real corporations and [[political]] organizations. Tactics like [[subversive affirmation]] and overidentification were used to create controversy and generate media coverage in dominant media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au8ZznxNU-A ARD-Tagesthemen über OLAF]", ARD (2011-08-15).&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[satiric]] content, those fake identities were often mistaken for the real thing and their critiques were not readily intelligible to audiences.
For example, in cooperation with Nüssli / Oeschger, he launched a counter-[[propaganda]] in order to subvert a [[xenophobic]] campaign of the [[swiss]] right wing party (SVP) by creating a twin-organization that was even more extreme in its claims – to a degree that it became [[ridiculous]] (OLAF, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xWwpT2KVdw Sammeltag für Ausländer, Bundesplatz Bern]". olafschweiz (2010-11-26).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the media coverage in the Swiss and international press was considerable, it did not put the [[Swiss]] electorate off from accepting the [[deportation]] [[initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.srf.ch/play/tv/kulturplatz/video/beissende-ironie?id=2af61856-f504-4691-b77d-9e8bc3bf9430 Beissende Ironie: Wie Satiriker auf populistische Kampagnen reagieren]". SF 1 (2010-12-01)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another example is the CHASOS Campaign, launched in 2011 as a [[satirical]] reaction on how media and politicians portrayed negative images and reinforces [[prejudices]] and fears by evoking the [[dystopia]] of gigantic waves of [[refugees]] which are alleged to flood Switzerland after the [[Arab Spring]].&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXqERgOINk8 ARD Tagesthemen vom 15 June 2011 über CHASOS]" ARD (2011-08-15)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nuremberg Race Laws 73901.jpg|right|thumb|Nuremberg Race Laws]]

'''Anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany''' comprised several laws that segregated the Jews from German society and restricted Jewish people's political, legal and civil rights. Major legislative initiatives included a series of restrictive laws passed in 1933, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] of 1935, and a final wave of legislation preceding Germany's entry into [[World War II]].

== 1933 Anti-Jewish Legislation ==

=== Enabling Act ===

The Enabling Act established the power of the Nazi Party to pass law [[by decree]], bypassing the approval of parliament. It was passed on March 24, 1933, and effectively nullified the [[Weimar Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz |last=Schleunes |first=Karl |year=1970 |location= |publisher= |isbn=978-0252000928 |pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service ===

In April 1933, the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, or 'Civil Service Law', as it was more commonly known when passed, established the ability of the Nazi Party to legally remove undesirables from the civil service profession, including doctors, teachers and lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=102–103|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many local governments also did not allow for the Jews to slaughter animals. In turn, this prevented the Jews from obeying Jewish dietary laws.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

This Law created the basis for the years to come, the Nazi party saw "racial purity [as a] condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=33|quote=Racial Purity was a condition of superior cultural creation and of the construction of a powerful state|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil Service Law was used to purify Germany through excluding Jews from key areas of the German community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service "defined the three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal". The first group included those who had been appointed after November 9, 1918, and could be removed if they did not have the proper training, which essentially meant anyone could fit into these standards. The Second group were those who were deemed by their past that they would not always support the national state. The third group were any "non-Aryans", a way of excluding the Jews without explicitly mentioning "Jews" in the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=103|quote="It defined three groups of undesirable civil servants and provided for their dismissal"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law Concerning Admission to the Legal Profession ===

This act of legislation was also passed in April as a supplement to the Civil Service Law. This law specifically attacked judges and public prosecutors, and forbade any Jews from taking the bar exam which was necessary to become a lawyer.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=105|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decree Regarding Physicians' Services with the National Health Service ===

This law affected Jewish doctors, and subsequently Jewish health care. Passed also in April, under this legislation, patients who saw a "non-Aryan" doctor would not be covered under the national health insurance, thus excluding Jewish doctors from German society.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== The Law Against the Over-Crowding of German Schools ===

Looking to further enact their racial agenda, the Nazi party then looked toward curbing educational policy. On April 25, 1933, the Law Against the Over-Crowding of German schools was passed, and required an end to any Weimar teachings that discussed democracy and equality; it enforced the teaching of racial pride. Under the guise of a concern for educational over-crowding, the Nazis limited the number of Jewish students enrolled in German schools to 1.5% of the total enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=1970|year=|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=106–107|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== July 1933 Citizenship and Denaturalization Law ===

With the goal of excluding Jews from having full citizenship rights an Advisory Committee for Population and Race Policy met at the ministry of the Interior to discuss a new citizenship law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=146|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What followed was the Denaturalization Law passed on July 14. As a result of this law, the Reich government could take away the citizenship of those who were deemed "undesirable", applying to anyone who had been given citizenship by the Weimar government. Those who saw the results of this law first were the "150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=110|quote="... revoke the citizenship of people it considered to be undesirable." "...against the estimated 150,000 Eastern Jews in Germany."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hereditary Farm Law ===

Passed on September 29, 1933, this law "excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture". It stated that only Germans could now be farmers. Though the law had minimal effect due to the lack of Jews involved in farming, it still displayed a central idea of the Nazi party that, "The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=112|quote="excluded Jews from owning farmland or engaging in agriculture". "The Reich government passes this law to secure the peasant foundations of our blood line through instituting the ancient customs of land inheritance."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Establishment of the Chambers of Culture ===

On September 29, 1933, the power of Jewish Cultural life in Germany was transferred to [[Joseph Goebbels]], who established chambers of culture that would regulate activity in their chamber of either film, theater, music, fine arts, literature, broadcasting, and the press.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=113|quote="producer of and actors in a movie to the ticket collectors in the theater". "Licensed permission from the chamber president."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each Chamber had the power to exclude anyone involved in any of the facets of culture, even without an "Aryan clause" written into the legislation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

For example, the film chamber could dismiss any Jews involved in any stages of the film-making process including the "producer, actors and ticket collectors in the theater". To continue involvement in the film industry one would need "licensed permission from the chamber president".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

As a supplement to the Chambers of Culture, a journalism law went into effect on October 4, 1933, stating that to produce work for the press, journalists and editors would also need specific legal permission.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==[[Nuremberg Laws]] ==
At their [[Nuremberg rallies|annual party rally held in Nuremberg]] in September 1935, the Nazi leaders announced a set of three new laws to further regulate and exclude Jews from German Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=978-0252000928|location=|pages=120|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws now known as the Nuremberg laws served also as the legality for the arrests and violence against Jews that would come to follow.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Germans and the Final Solution|last=Bankier|first=David|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-631-17968-2|location=|pages=41–42|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nuremberg Laws were created in response to Hitler's demands for broadened citizenship laws that could "underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=148|quote="underpin the more specifically racial-biological anti-Jewish legislation".|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made to reflect the party principles that had been outlined in the points Hitler had written in the [[National Socialist Program]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Germans and the Final Solution|last=Bankier|first=David|publisher=|year=1992|isbn=0-631-17968-2|location=|pages=43|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reich Flag Law ===

The first law stated that black, red, and white were the national colors, and the swastika flag was the new national flag. Per Hitler, this law was stated to "re-pay a debt of gratitude to the movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party".&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=142|quote="Repay a debt of gratitude to the Movement, under whose symbol Germany regained its freedom, in that they fulfill a significant item on the program of the National Socialist Party."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Citizenship Law ===

The second law established who would be granted full political and civic rights and those who would now be deprived of them. Citizenship rights were to be granted to those who were citizens of the Reich, which were only individuals classified as being of "German or related blood"; therefore, Jews were excluded from any and all citizenship rights, becoming ''Staatsangehörige'' or state subjects,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; essentially making them foreigners in their own country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== The Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor ===

The third law forbade marriage and any relations between Jews and German citizens. The law also made any previously existing marriages or those contracted outside of Germany invalid. Furthermore, Jews were forbidden from employing German female citizens who were under 45 years old. Under this law, Jews were also forbidden to raise the German Flag.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Supplemental Decrees ===

After the Nuremberg Laws were passed, the Nazi Party also introduced supplemental decrees to the Citizenship Law and the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor to specifically outline who would be considered a Jew, and who would therefore be subject to the Nuremberg Laws' exclusionary principles

On November 14, the first supplemental decree was published, and it defined a Jewish person as anyone who had at least three full Jewish grandparents, had two Jewish grandparents and were married to a Jewish spouse, belonged to the Jewish religion at the time of the law's publication, or who entered the Jewish religion later.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=149|quote="between a Jew and a Mischling with one Jewish Grandparent, between a Mischling and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a Mischling with two Jewish Grandparents and a German."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mischling|''Mischlinge'']] or the German legal term for those who had "Aryan" and Jewish blood, were also clarified to determine who would be considered a Jew. Those that were three-quarters Jewish were Jewish as well as those who were half Jewish due to their choice of becoming Jewish via a Jewish spouse or through joining a Jewish community.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

A second decree was published on December 21, which stated that Jewish professors, teachers, physicians, lawyers, and notaries who were state employees, and had previously been exempt, would now be dismissed from their positions.

In the first decree to the Law for the Defense of German Blood and Honor, it stated which specific marriages were forbidden. These included those "between a Jew and a ''Mischling'' with one Jewish Grandparent, between a ''Mischling'' and another each with one Jewish Grandparent, and between a ''Mischling'' with two Jewish Grandparents and a German".&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

==Post-Nuremberg legislation ==

=== 1936 Berlin Olympic Games ===

In order to prevent foreign criticism of Germany, and keep the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, and to prevent economic loss and a blow to German prestige, Hitler eased the anti-Jewish stance momentarily.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Twisted Road to Auschwitz|last=Schluenes|first=Karl|publisher=|year=1970|isbn=9780252000928|location=|pages=126–127|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, all anti-Jewish signs near the site of the winter Olympics were to be removed. Though, normally, this would be considered a sign of good faith, it was, in actuality, only an action taken to ensure the Olympics would be held in Germany by preventing international disapproval.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Second wave of anti-Jewish legislation, 1938-1939 ===
After the Nuremberg Legislations and during 1938, "worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase, 1938 was the fateful turning point."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nazi Germany and The Jews|last=Friedlander|first=Saul|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=0-06-019042-6|location=|pages=180|quote="worse than total expropriation was to follow: Economic harassment and even violence would henceforward be used to force the Jews to flee the Reich or the newly annexed Austria. Within the second phase 1938 was the fateful turning point."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De-certification of all Jewish physicians, who were no longer allowed to treat German patients and forced to refer to themselves as "sick-treaters", a degrading term.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews: A History|last=Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann|first=John, Steven, Matthias|publisher=Pearson Education inc|year=2004|isbn=0-205-89626-X|location=|pages=410–411|quote="sick-treaters"|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

March 22, 1938 Jews were forbidden from owning private gardens&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

July 27, 1938 A decree was enforced stating all streets in Germany needed to be re-named&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

November 12, 1938 Jews were forbidden from attending movie theaters, the opera, and concerts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

November 15, 1938 Jewish children barred from attending public school&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The essential robbery of Jews became legal when Jews were forced on February 21, 1939, to turn in all jewelry of any value.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In this second wave of legislation, Jews were ostracized even further from society, with strict restrictions living under "a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Jews: A History|last=Efron, Weitzman, Lehmann|first=John, Steven, Matthias|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2004|isbn=0-205-89626-X|location=|pages=413|quote="a German regime that practiced terror and arbitrariness through the judicial system."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Kristallnacht ==

[[Kristallnacht]] or the night of broken glass refers to Jewish pogroms that took place on November 9 and 10 in 1938. This wave of violence took place in Germany, annexed Austria, and areas of Sudetenland that were occupied by Germany.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005201|title=Kristallnacht|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attacks took place against synagogues, Jewish-owned businesses, other Jewish establishments, and Jewish citizens in general. More than 100 Jewish people were killed, and thousands more were arrested during these attacks.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Remembering Kristallnacht|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/218742963|journal=The Jerusalem Report|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was also the start to organized Nazi attacks, and the mass incarceration of the Jews. There was no clear Instructions on how to execute the violence, so it caused the destroying of Jewish property and inhumane treatment of Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doescher|first=Hans|year=2011|title=Kristallnacht 1938|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/873572091|journal=Shofar|volume=|pages=131–132|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rioters destroyed 267 synagogues throughout Germany, Austria, and Sudetenland. The firefighter were instructed to prevent the flames from spreading to nearby buildings, but not to put the fires out on the burning synagogues. There was also about 7,500 Jewish-owned establishments that were robbed and had their windows shattered. About 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and moved to prisons or concentration camps as well. What made things even worse is the fact that the German government placed full blame on the Jews for the destructions and imposed a fine of one billion [[Reichsmark]] on the Jewish community. The government also took away all insurance payouts that would go to the Jews whose businesses or homes got destroyed. This left the Jews responsible for the costs of all repairs.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

This led to many decrees in the weeks following. These decrees were designed to deprive the Jews of their means of living. Many of these movements enforced [[Aryanization (Nazism)|"Aryanization"]] policy. This meant that Jewish-owned property would be transferred to "Aryan" ownership for a fraction of the true value. To further remove the Jews from public life, the Jews were expelled from attending German schools, and they lost the right to have a driver's license or own an automobile.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Kristallnacht was essentially the turning point in the Nazis persecution of the Jewish people. It expanded the efforts to remove Jews from German economic and social life. It also led to forced emigration of Jews in order to make Germany free of Jews.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Kristallnacht and the events that followed it showed the Nazi regime that they could count on the nationwide support of anti-Semitism from the general public. This showed the Nazis that they could easily move forward with their plans without much opposition from within Germany. The events of Kristallnacht foreshadowed the Holocaust and mass murders of the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

== Timeline of anti-Jewish legislation and movements in pre-war Germany ==
During the pre-war Nazi Germany period (1933-1939) there were more than 400 laws, decrees and other type of regulations whose goal was to restrict Jews. There were national laws that affected all Jews, and there were state, region and city laws that only affected the Jews in those communities. These regulations limited Jews in all aspects of life, both public and private. Almost all people were involved in the support of anti-Jewish legislation in some way, whether it was passive agreement or direct involvement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005681|title=ANTI-JEWISH LEGISLATION IN PRE-WAR GERMANY|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements were all part of Hitler's intention and plan to rid the planet of all Jewish population. Hitler's plan started with stripping all Jews of their basic rights, before moving into the mass murdering of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Katz|first=Steven|year=1994|title=ideas made the Holocaust- The Holocaust in Historical Context: The Holocaust and Mass Death before the Modern Age|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/210394559/|journal=Commonweal|volume=1|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* March 24: The Enabling Act was passed. This act brought an end to democracy in Germany. It gave the government the power to govern legislation by decree. It gave them the legal right to make discriminatory policies in the future. Hitler was allowed to make laws that violated the Weimar constitution without the approval of the parliament or Reich President with this act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007892|title=The Enabling Act|last=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|first=|date=|website=Holocaust Encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 31: A decree in the city of Berlin said that Jewish doctors were suspended from the city's charity services.
* April 7: There was a law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service. This law removed all Jews from government service. Also, a law on the Admission to the Legal Profession forbade the Jews from taking the bar exam, which is a test needed to become a lawyer.
* April 25: A law about over-crowded Schools and Universities limited the number of Jewish students allowed in public schools. The number of Jewish students in one school was limited to no more than 5% of the total population. The schools helped to spread Hitler's ideas. They taught students to love Hitler and to obey the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805217/73089/excerpt/9780521773089_excerpt.pdf|title=Introduction: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust|last=Brustein|first=William|date=|website=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|access-date=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* July 14: The Jewish people lost citizenship because of a De-Naturalization Law. This took citizenship away from all Jews, including naturalized Jews and "undesirables".
* October 4: The Jews were banned from editorial posts by a law on editors. 
'''1934:''' &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* The national Nazi Government forbade Jewish actors from performing on the stage or the screen.
* Local governments issued regulations on other aspects of Jewish life. The Jews were no longer allowed to slaughter animals, which prevented them from obeying Jewish dietary laws. 
'''1935:'''
* May 21: A law was made on military participation that outlawed Jewish officers in the army.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
* September 15: The Nazi leaders announced the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. These laws excluded Jews from having citizenship and marrying or having sex with German women. They also deprived the Jews of basic political rights such as voting rights, and the right to hold a political office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Henry|year=2002|title=The Legacy of Nuremberg|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/211090114/|journal=Case Western Reserve Journal of International Law|volume=|pages=335–336|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws also restricted the Jews economically by making it difficult for the Jews to make money. The laws reduced Jewish-owned businesses in Germany by two-thirds.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Under the [[Mischling Test]], individuals were considered Jewish if they had at least one Jewish grandparent.
'''1936:''' &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* January 11: An Executive Order on the Reich Tax Law forbade Jews from being tax consultants.
* April 3: Jews were banned from the veterinary profession by the Reich Veterinarians Law.
* October 15: The [[Reich]] Ministry of Education banned Jewish teachers from teaching in public schools. 
'''1937:''' &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

* October 5: The Reich Interior Ministry invalidated all German passports owned by Jews. The only way for the Jews to get their passports validated was to get a J stamped on it. 
* November 12: All Jewish-owned businesses were closed by a decree on the Exclusion of Jews from German Economic Life. 
* November 15: All Jewish children were expelled from public schools by the Reich Ministry of Education. 
* November 28: The freedom of movement was highly restricted by the Reich Interior Ministry.

{{for|the concept in trademark law|trademark distinctiveness}}
'''Arbitrariness''' is the quality of being "determined by chance, whim, or impulse, and not by necessity, reason, or principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/arbitrariness|title=arbitrariness|author=|date=|publisher=|accessdate=21 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arbitrary decisions are not necessarily the same as [[random]] decisions.  For example, during the [[1973 oil crisis]], Americans were allowed to purchase gasoline only on odd-numbered days if their license plate was odd, and on even-numbered days if their license plate was even.  The system was well-defined and not random in its restrictions; however, since license plate numbers are completely unrelated to a person's fitness to purchase gasoline, it was still an arbitrary division of people.  Similarly, schoolchildren are often organized by their [[surname]] in alphabetical order, a non-random yet still arbitrary method, at least in cases where surnames are irrelevant.

==Law== 
''Arbitrary'' comes from the Latin ''arbitrarius'', the source of ''arbiter''; someone who is tasked to judge some matter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arbitrary Online Etymology Dictionary]: "'deciding by one's own discretion,' from L. arbitrarius, from arbiter (see arbiter). The original meaning gradually to mean ‘capricious’ (1646) and ‘despotic’ (1642).”&lt;/ref&gt;  An arbitrary legal judgment is a decision made at the discretion of the judge, not one that is fixed by  law.&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, Thomas.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=p31MAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA565&amp;lpg=PA565&amp;dq=%22discretion+of+the+judge%22+and+arbitrary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tl9MMK-av4&amp;sig=Zd8y_5GB9g8c-GX0qg87BHllhqo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ShbJSZylDcrJtgeM-IyUAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ct=result#PPA565,M1 The London Encyclopaedia]'', page 565 (1829): “Arbitrary, and the words more immediately connected with it, signify that the decision of the arbiter is made in consequence of his own uncontrolled will, or in consequence of reasons which do not appear.”&lt;/ref&gt;  In some countries, a prohibition of arbitrariness is enshrined into the [[constitution]].  Article 9 of the [[Swiss Federal Constitution]] theoretically overrides even democratic decisions in prohibiting arbitrary government action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/1/101.en.pdf Federal Constitution of the Swiss Federation]. The Federal Authorities
of the Swiss Confederation.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] has overturned laws for having "[[Rational basis review|no rational basis]]."  A recent study of the U.S. asylum system suggests that arbitrariness in decision-making might be the cause of large disparities in outcomes between different adjudicators, a phenomenon described as [[refugee roulette]].

Article 330 of the Russian penal code defines 'Arbitrariness' as a specific crime, but with a very broad definition encompassing any 'actions contrary to the order presented by a law'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |work=The Criminal Code Of The Russian Federation

  |url=http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter32.html
  |quote=Arbitrariness, that is the unauthorized commission of actions contrary to the order presented by a law or any other normative legal act, 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Arbitrary actions are closely related to [[teleology]], the study of purpose.  Actions lacking a ''[[telos (philosophy)|telos]]'', a goal, are necessarily arbitrary.  With no end to measure against, there can be no standard applied to choices, so all decisions are alike.  Note that arbitrary or random methods in the standard sense of ''arbitrary'' may not qualify as arbitrary choices philosophically, if they were done in furtherance of a larger purpose; in the examples above, discipline in school and avoiding overcrowding at gas stations.

[[Nihilism]] is the philosophy that believes that there is no purpose in the universe, and that ''every'' choice is arbitrary.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Bernd (1971). "Nihilism, Reason, and "The Good"." ''The Review of Metaphysics.'' '''25''' (2):292&amp;ndash;310.&lt;/ref&gt; According to nihilism, the universe contains no value and is essentially meaningless. Because the universe and all of its constituents contain no higher goal for us to make subgoals from, all aspects of human life and experiences are completely arbitrary. There is no right or wrong decision, thought or practice, and whatever choice a human being makes is just as meaningless and empty as any other choice he or she could have made.

Many brands of [[theism]], the belief in a [[deity]] or deities, believe that everything has a purpose and that ''nothing'' is arbitrary.  In these philosophies, God created the universe for a reason, and every event flows from that.  Even seemingly random events cannot escape God's hand and purpose.  This is somewhat related to the [[argument from design]], the argument for God's existence because a purpose can be found in the universe.

Arbitrariness is also related to [[ethics]], the philosophy of decision-making.  Even if a person has a goal, they may choose to attempt to achieve it in ways that may be considered arbitrary.  [[Rationalism]] holds that knowledge comes about through intellectual calculation and deduction; many rationalists (though not all) apply this to ethics as well.  All decisions should be made through reason and logic, not via whim or how one "feels" what is right.  Randomness may occasionally be acceptable as part of a subtask in furtherance of a larger goal, but not in general.

In [[semiotics]], the general theory of signs, sign systems, and sign processes, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] introduced the notion of [[Course in General Linguistics#Arbitrariness|arbitrariness]] according to which there is no necessary connection between the material sign (or ''signifier'') and the entity it refers to or denotes as its meaning (or ''signified'') as a mental concept or real object. 

Spontaneous arbitration...

==Mathematics==
In mathematics, arbitrary normally means "any;" for instance, an arbitrary division of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] or an arbitrary [[permutation]] of a sequence.  Its use implies generality and that a statement does not only apply to special cases &amp;ndash; "you may select any choice possible, and this statement will still hold."  A simple example would be "Given an arbitrary integer, multiplying it by two will result in an [[Even and odd numbers|even number]]."

Even further, the implication is that generality will hold even if you have an opponent choose the item in question.  In some ways ''arbitrary'' is here synonymous with ''worst-case''.&lt;ref&gt;Tel, Gérard (2000). ''Introduction to distributed algorithms.'' Cambridge University Press. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the use of the appeal to authority in science can be seen in 1923, when leading American zoologist [[Theophilus Painter]] declared, based on poor data and conflicting observations he had made,&lt;ref name ="Painter_Account" /&gt;&lt;ref name="48_taught"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mertens|first1=Thomas|title=The Role of Factual Knowledge in Biology Teaching|journal=[[The American Biology Teacher]]|date=October 1979|volume=41|issue=7|doi=10.2307/4446671|url=http://abt.ucpress.edu/content/41/7/395|pages=395–419|jstor=4446671}}&lt;/ref&gt; that humans had 24 pairs of [[chromosomes]]. From the 1920s to the 1950s, this continued to be held based on Painter's authority,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= O'Connor|first= Clare|year= 2008|title= Human Chromosome Number|publisher= Nature|url= http://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/Human-Chromosome-Number-294|accessdate= April 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gartler|first1=Stanley|title=The Chromosome Number in Humans: A Brief History|journal=[[Nature Reviews Genetics]]|date=2006|volume=7|issue=8|pages=655–60|url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/content/The-chromosome-number-in-humans-a-brief-15575|doi=10.1038/nrg1917|pmid=16847465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="48_taught" /&gt; despite subsequent counts totaling the [[Chromosome#Human chromosomes|correct number]] of 23.&lt;ref name="Painter_Account"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Glass|first1=Bentley|title=Theophilus Shickel Painter|date=1990|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|location=Washington, DC|pages=316–17|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/painter-theophilus-shickel.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Orrell|first1=David PhD.|title=The Future of Everything: The Science of Prediction|date=2008|pages=184–85|title-link=Apollo's Arrow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even textbooks&lt;ref name="Painter_Account" /&gt; with photos showing 23 pairs incorrectly declared the number to be 24&lt;ref name="Orrell_2008"/&gt; based on the authority of the then-consensus of 24 pairs.&lt;ref name="Down_Binder"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kevles|first1=Daniel J.|title=Human Chromosomes--Down's Disorder and the Binder's Mistakes|journal=Engineering and Science|date=1985|page=9|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/594/2/Kevles.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example involved the "[[When contact changes minds|When contact changes minds: An experiment on transmission of support for gay equality]]" paper. The paper was a fraud based on forged data, yet concerns about it were ignored in many cases due to appeals to authority. One analysis of the affair notes that "Over and over again, throughout the scientific community and the media, LaCour’s impossible-seeming results were treated as truth, in part because of the weight [the study's co-author] [[Donald Green|Green]]’s name carried".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=The Case of the Amazing Gay-Marriage Data: How a Graduate Student Reluctantly Uncovered a Huge Scientific Fraud|url=https://www.thecut.com/2015/05/how-a-grad-student-uncovered-a-huge-fraud.html|publisher=The Cut|date=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One psychologist stated his reaction to the paper was "that’s very surprising and doesn’t fit with a huge literature of evidence. It doesn’t sound plausible to me... [then I pull it up and] I see [[Donald Green|Don Green]] is an author. I trust him completely, so I’m no longer doubtful". The forger, LaCour, would use appeals to authority to defend his research: "if his responses sometimes seemed to lack depth when he was pressed for details, his impressive connections often allayed concerns", with one of his partners stating "when he and I really had a disagreement, he would often rely on the kind of arguments where he’d basically invoke authority, right? He’s the one with advanced training, and his adviser is this very high-powered, very experienced person...and they know a lot more than we do".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"/&gt;

Much like the erroneous chromosome number taking decades to refute until microscopy made the error unmistakable, the one who would go on to debunk this paper "was consistently told by friends and advisers to keep quiet about his concerns lest he earn a reputation as a troublemaker", up until "the very last moment when multiple 'smoking guns' finally appeared", and he found that "There was almost no encouragement for him to probe the hints of weirdness he’d uncovered".&lt;ref name="Gay Marriage Fraud"/&gt;

=== {{anchor|False authority}} Appeal to non-authorities ===

Fallacious arguments from [[authority]] are also frequently the result of citing a non-authority as an authority.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skepdic.com/authorty.html|title=Appeal to Authority|ref=skepdic|last1=Carroll|first1=Robert|website=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the fallacy of appealing to an authority in an unrelated field would be citing [[Albert Einstein]] as an authority for a determination on religion when his primary expertise was in [[physics]].&lt;ref name="skepdic" /&gt; The body of attributed authorities might not even welcome their citation, such as with the "More Doctors Smoke [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]]s" ad campaign.&lt;ref&gt;https://csts.ua.edu/files/2016/09/1983-When-More-Doctors-Smoked-Camels-Cigarette-advertising-in-the-Journal-NYSJM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a fallacious ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument to argue that a person presenting statements lacks authority and thus their arguments do not need to be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williamson|first1=Owen|title=Master List of Logical Fallacies|url=http://utminers.utep.edu/omwilliamson/ENGL1311/fallacies.htm|publisher=[[The University of Texas at El Paso]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As appeals to a perceived lack of authority, these types of argument are fallacious for much the same reasons as an appeal to authority.

Other related fallacious arguments assume that a person without status or authority is inherently reliable. For instance, the [[appeal to poverty]] is the fallacy of thinking that someone is more likely to be correct because they are poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruggiero|first1=Tim|title=Logical Fallacies|url=http://www.philosophicalsociety.com/Logical%20Fallacies.htm#argumentum%20ad%20lazarum%20--%20The%20fallacy%20of%20supposing%20a%20conclusion%20is%20valid%20because%20the%20argument%20is%20made%20by%20a%20poor%20person.%20It%20is%20the%20opposite%20of%20the%20ad%20crumenam%20fallacy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an argument holds that a conclusion is likely to be true precisely because the one who holds or is presenting it lacks authority, it is a fallacious ''appeal to the common man''.&lt;ref name="Common_man_ref"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=B.|title=Appeal to the Common Man|url=http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/24-appeal-to-common-folk|website=Logically Fallacious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cognitive bias ==
The argument from authority is based on the idea that a perceived authority must know better and that the person should conform to their opinion. This has its roots in psychological [[cognitive biases]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi = 10.1057/9780230297616_5|chapter = Social Influence: Modes and Modalities|title = The Social Psychology of Communication|pages = 87–106|year = 2011|last1 = Sammut|first1 = Gordon|last2 = Bauer|first2 = Martin W|isbn = 978-0-230-24736-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Asch effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Delameter|first1=Andrew|title=Contrasting Scientific &amp; Non-Scientific Approaches to Acquiring Knowledge|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Xu_Mcci-vPsJ:academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/psych/delam/53.1/Lecture1.pptx+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|agency=City University of New York|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Brian|last2=Macdonald|first2=Geraldine|title=A Textbook of Social Work|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dt6NAgAAQBAJ|publisher=Routledge|page=40|isbn=9781135282615}}&lt;/ref&gt; In repeated and modified instances of the [[Asch conformity experiments]], it was found that high-status individuals create a stronger likelihood of a subject agreeing with an obviously false conclusion, despite the subject normally being able to clearly see that the answer was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= McLeod| first= Samuel| year= 2008| title= Asch Experiment| publisher= Simply Psychology|url= http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, humans have been shown to feel strong emotional pressure to conform to authorities and majority positions. A repeat of the experiments by another group of researchers found that "Participants reported considerable [[Stress (psychological)|distress]] under the group pressure", with 59% conforming at least once and agreeing with the clearly incorrect answer, whereas the incorrect answer was much more rarely given when no such pressures were present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Webley| first= Paul| title= A partial and non-evaluative history of the Asch effect| publisher=[[University of Exeter]]|url= http://people.exeter.ac.uk/PWebley/psy1002/asch.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study shining light on the psychological basis of the fallacy as it relates to perceived authorities are the [[Milgram experiments]], which demonstrated that people are more likely to go along with something when it is presented by an authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Milgram | first1 = S | year = 1965 | title = Some conditions of obedience and disobedience to authority | url = | journal = Human Relations | volume = 18 | issue = 1| pages = 57–76 | doi=10.1177/001872676501800105}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a variation of a study where the researchers did not wear a lab coat, thus reducing the perceived authority of the tasker, the obedience level dropped to 20% from the original rate, which had been higher than 50%. Obedience is encouraged by reminding the individual of what a perceived authority states and by showing them that their opinion goes against this authority.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that certain environments can produce an ideal situation for these processes to take hold, giving rise to [[groupthink]].&lt;ref&gt;https://disruptedphysician.com/2014/12/page/2/&lt;/ref&gt; In groupthink, individuals in a group feel inclined to minimize conflict and encourage conformity. Through an appeal to authority, a group member might present that opinion as a consensus and encourage the other group members to engage in groupthink by not disagreeing with this perceived consensus or authority.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of GROUPTHINK. (2017). Merriam-webster.com. Retrieved from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/groupthink&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rossi|first1=Stacey (2006)|title=Examination of Exclusion Rates in Massachusetts Public Schools|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED492086.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; One paper about the philosophy of mathematics for example notes that, within academia, &lt;blockquote&gt;If...a person accepts our discipline, and goes through two or three years of [[graduate study]] in mathematics, he absorbs our way of thinking, and is no longer the critical outsider he once was...If the student is unable to absorb our way of thinking, we flunk him out, of course.

Corporate environments are similarly vulnerable to appeals to perceived authorities and experts leading to groupthink,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lookwin|first1=B.

{{Certainty sidebar}}
'''Belief''' is the state of [[mind]] in which a person thinks something to be the case with or without there being [[empirical evidence]] to prove that something is the case with factual certainty. Another way of defining belief sees it as a [[mental representation]] of an [[Intentionality|attitude positively oriented]] towards the [[likelihood]] of something being [[truth|true]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Primmer |first= Justin |editor-last= Primmer |editor-first= Justin |contribution= Belief |title= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher= The Metaphysics Research Lab |location= Stanford, CA |year= 2018|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/ |accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of [[Ancient Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek thought]], two related concepts were identified with regards to the concept of belief: ''[[Pistis#Pistis in rhetoric|pistis]]'' and ''[[doxa]]''. Simplified, we may say that ''pistis'' refers to "trust" and "confidence", while ''doxa'' refers to "opinion" and "acceptance".  The English word "[[orthodoxy]]" derives from ''doxa''.  Jonathan Leicester suggests that belief has the purpose of guiding action rather than indicating [[truth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Primmer|first1= Justin|title= The nature and purpose of belief|journal= Journal of Mind and Behavior|date= 2018|volume= 29|issue= 3|pages= 219–239|url= http://philpapers.org/rec/LEITNA|accessdate= 3 June 2018 | quote = The purpose of belief is to guide action, not to indicate truth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[epistemology]], philosophers use the term "belief" to refer to personal attitudes
associated with [[truth value|true or false]] ideas and concepts. However, "belief" does not require active [[introspection]] and circumspection. For example, we never ponder whether or not the sun will rise. We simply assume the sun will rise. Since "belief" is an important aspect of mundane life, according to Eric Schwitzgebel in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', a related question asks: "how a physical organism can have beliefs?"&lt;ref&gt;

==Knowledge and epistemology==
[[Epistemology]] is concerned with delineating the boundary between justified belief and [[opinion]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionaries – [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/epistemology definition] published by [[OUP]] [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt; and involved generally with a theoretical [[philosophical]] study of [[knowledge]]. The primary problem in epistemology is to understand exactly what is needed in order for us to have knowledge. In a notion derived from [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Theaetetus (dialogue)|Theaetetus]]'', where the epistemology of Socrates (Platon) most clearly departs from that of the [[sophist]]s, who at the time of Plato seem to have defined knowledge as what is here expressed as "[[justified true belief]]". The tendency to translate from belief (here: doxa – common opinion) to knowledge (here: episteme), which Plato (e.g. [[Socrates]] of the dialogue) utterly dismisses, results from failing to distinguish a [[dispositive]] belief (gr. 'doxa', not 'pistis') from knowledge (episteme) when the opinion is regarded ''true'' (here: orthé), in terms of right, and juristically so (according to the premises of the dialogue), which was the task of the [[rhetor]]s to prove. Plato dismisses this possibility of an affirmative relation between belief (i.e. opinion) and [[knowledge]] even when the one who opines grounds his belief on the rule, and is able to add ''justification'' (gr. [[logos]]: reasonable and necessarily plausible assertions/evidence/guidance) to it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.friesian.com/knowledg.htm – Copyright (c) 2007, 2008 Kelley L. Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved&lt;/ref&gt;

Plato has been credited for the "''justified true belief''" theory of knowledge, even though Plato in the [[Theaetetus (dialogue)]] elegantly dismisses it, and even posits this argument of Socrates as a cause for his death penalty. Among American epistemologists, [[Edmund Gettier|Gettier]] (1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gettier |first=E. L. |year=1963 |title=Is justified true belief knowledge? |journal=[[Analysis (journal)|Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=6 |pages=121–123 |doi= 10.1093/analys/23.6.121|jstor=3326922 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Goldman|Goldman]] (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goldman |first=A. I. |year=1967 |title=A causal theory of knowing |journal=[[The Journal of Philosophy]] |volume=64 |issue=12 |pages=357–372 |doi= 10.2307/2024268|jstor=2024268 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have questioned the "justified true belief" definition, and challenged the "sophists" of their time.

==As a psychological phenomenon==
Mainstream psychology and related disciplines have traditionally treated belief as if it were the simplest form of mental representation and therefore one of the building blocks of conscious thought. Philosophers have tended to be more abstract in their analysis, and much of the work examining the viability of the belief concept stems from philosophical analysis.

The concept of belief presumes a subject (the believer) and an object of belief (the proposition). So, like other [[propositional attitude]]s, belief implies the existence of [[mental state]]s and [[intentionality]], both of which are hotly debated topics in the [[philosophy of mind]], whose foundations and relation to brain states are still controversial.

Beliefs are sometimes divided into [[core beliefs]] (that are actively thought about) and ''[[dispositional belief]]s'' (that may be ascribed to someone who has not thought about the issue). For example, if asked "do you believe tigers wear pink pajamas?" a person might answer that they do not, despite the fact they may never have thought about this situation before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bell |first=V. |last2=Halligan |first2=P. W. |last3=Ellis |first3=H. D. |year=2006 |chapter=A Cognitive Neuroscience of Belief |editor1-first=Peter W. |editor1-last=Halligan |editor2-first=Mansel |editor2-last=Aylward |title=The Power of Belief: Psychological Influence on Illness, Disability, and Medicine |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-853010-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has important implications for understanding the [[neuropsychology]] and [[neuroscience]] of belief. If the concept of belief is incoherent, then any attempt to find the underlying neural processes that support it will fail.

Philosopher [[Lynne Rudder Baker]] has outlined four main contemporary approaches to belief in her controversial book ''Saving Belief'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lynne Rudder |last=Baker |title=Saving Belief: A Critique of Physicalism |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1989 |location= |isbn=0-691-07320-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is correct - Sometimes called the "mental sentence theory," in this conception, beliefs exist as coherent entities, and the way we talk about them in everyday life is a valid basis for scientific endeavour. [[Jerry Fodor]] is one of the principal defenders of this point of view.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief may not be entirely correct, but it is close enough to make some useful predictions – This view argues that we will eventually reject the idea of belief as we know it now, but that there may be a correlation between what we take to be a belief when someone says "I believe that snow is white" and how a future theory of psychology will explain this behaviour. Most notably, philosopher [[Stephen Stich]] has argued for this particular understanding of belief.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong and will be completely superseded by a radically different theory that will have no use for the concept of belief as we know it – Known as [[eliminativism]], this view (most notably proposed by [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]]) argues that the concept of belief is like obsolete theories of times past such as [[the four humours]] theory of medicine, or the [[phlogiston theory]] of combustion. In these cases science hasn't provided us with a more detailed account of these theories, but completely rejected them as valid scientific concepts to be replaced by entirely different accounts. The Churchlands argue that our common-sense concept of belief is similar in that as we discover more about neuroscience and the brain, the inevitable conclusion will be to reject the belief hypothesis in its entirety.
* Our common-sense understanding of belief is entirely wrong; however, treating people, animals, and even computers as if they had beliefs is often a successful strategy – The major proponents of this view, [[Daniel Dennett]] and [[Lynne Rudder Baker]], are both [[eliminativism|eliminativists]] in that they hold that beliefs are not a scientifically valid concept, but they don't go as far as rejecting the concept of belief as a predictive device. Dennett gives the example of playing a computer at chess. While few people would agree that the computer held beliefs, treating the computer as if it did (e.g. that the computer believes that taking the opposition's queen will give it a considerable advantage) is likely to be a successful and predictive strategy. In this understanding of belief, named by Dennett ''the [[intentional stance]]'', belief-based explanations of mind and behaviour are at a different level of explanation and are not reducible to those based on fundamental neuroscience, although both may be explanatory at their own level.
Strategic approaches make a distinction between rules, norms and beliefs as follows:
(1) Rules. Explicit regulative processes such as policies, laws, inspection routines, or incentives. Rules function as a coercive regulator of behavior and are dependent upon the imposing entity's ability to enforce them.
(2) Norms. Regulative mechanisms accepted by the social collective. Norms are enforced by normative mechanisms within the organization and are not strictly dependent upon law or regulation.
(3) Beliefs. The collective perception of fundamental truths governing behavior. The adherence to accepted and shared beliefs by members of a social system will likely persist and be difficult to change over time. Strong beliefs about determinant factors (i.e., security, survival, or honor) are likely to cause a social entity or group to accept rules and norms.&lt;ref&gt;Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S. Army (2012). Information Operations. Joint Publication 3–13. Joint Doctrine Support Division, 116 Lake View Parkway, Suffolk, VA. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological belief compared to religious belief==
Historically ''belief-in'' belonged in the realm of religious thought, ''belief-that'' instead belonged to epistemological considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Price | first1 = H. H. | year = 1965 | title = Belief 'In' and Belief 'That' | url = http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2400996 | journal = Religious Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 01| pages = 5–27 | doi = 10.1017/S0034412500002304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief-in===
To "believe in" someone or something is a distinct concept from "believing-that." There are at least these types of belief-in:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacIntosh |first=J. J. |year=1994 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-15948893/belief-revisited-reply-williams.html |title=Belief-in Revisited: A Reply to Williams |journal=Religious Studies |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=487–503 |doi=10.1017/S0034412500023131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Commendatory''' / '''[[Faith]]''' - we may make an expression of 'faith' in respect of some performance by an agent X, when without prejudice to the truth value of the factual outcome or even confidence in X otherwise, we expect that specific performance. In particular [[self-confidence]] or faith in one's self is this kind of belief.
* '''Existential claim''' – to claim belief in the existence of an entity or phenomenon in a general way with the implied need to justify its claim to existence. It is often used when the entity is not real, or its existence is in doubt. "He believes in witches and ghosts" or "many children believe in Santa Claus" or "I believe in a deity" are typical examples.&lt;ref name="belief-in"&gt;{{cite book |last=Macintosh |first=Jack |chapter=Belief-in |title=[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]] |page=86 |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The linguistic form is distinct from the assertion of the truth of a proposition since verification is either considered impossible/irrelevant or a [[counterfactual]] situation is assumed.

Economic beliefs are beliefs which are reasonably and necessarily contrary to the tenet of rational choice or instrumental rationality.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Taylor-Gooby – [https://www.issa.int/html/pdf/jeru98/theme3/3-1a.pdf ECONOMIC BELIEFS AND SOCIAL POLICY BEHAVIOUR] [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (Economic Beliefs and behaviour research programme) [Retrieved 2015-08-09]&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the Austrian tradition of the economic thought, in the context of analysis of the influence and subsequent degree of change resulting from  existing economic knowledge and belief, has contributed the most to the subsequent holistic collective analysis.&lt;ref name="R. Arena"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuWtuUnc1u4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBGoVChMI1N-8qfSbxwIVzLUUCh0tuwX3&amp;q=economic%20beliefs|author=R. Arena &amp; A. Festré|title=Knowledge, Beliefs and Economics|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing 1 Jan 2006, 288 pages, |ISBN=1847201539|accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Delusion====
Insofar as the truth of belief is expressed in sentential  and propositional form we are using the sense of ''belief-that'' rather than ''belief-in''. [[Delusion]] arises when the truth value of the form is clearly nil.&lt;ref name="L. Bortolotti"&gt;{{cite book |author=L. Bortolotti|title=Delusions and Other Irrational Beliefs|publisher=OUP Oxford 2010, 299 pages, ''International Perspectives in Philosophy &amp; Psychiatry'' |ISBN=0199206163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/tarski-truth/ ''Tarski's Truth Definitions''], [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/language-thought/ ''LOTH''] Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences" Alfred Tarski Dover 1995/41, Ch. I, &amp;sect; 2 ''Expressions containing variables—sentential and designatory functions'' and Ch. II ''On the Sentential Calculus'' in its entirety&lt;/ref&gt;

Delusions are defined as beliefs in [[psychiatric]] diagnostic criteria&lt;ref&gt;[http://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2013/06/delusions-in-dsm-5.html ''Delusions in the DSM 5''] A blog by Lisa Bortolotti &amp; Ema Sullivan-Bissett&lt;/ref&gt; (for example in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]''). Psychiatrist and historian [[G.E. Berrios]] has challenged the view that delusions are genuine beliefs and instead labels them as "empty speech acts," where affected persons are motivated to express false or bizarre belief statements due to an underlying psychological disturbance. However, the majority of mental health professionals and researchers treat delusions as if they were genuine beliefs.

In [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' the [[White Queen (Through the Looking-Glass)|White Queen]] says, "Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." This is often quoted in mockery of the common ability of people to [[Credo quia absurdum|entertain beliefs contrary to fact]].

==Formation==
[[File:Ripples of influence.jpg|thumb|We are influenced by many factors that ripple through our minds as our beliefs form, evolve, and may eventually change]]

Psychologists study belief formation and the relationship between beliefs and actions. Three models of belief formation and change have been proposed:

===The conditional inference process===
When people are asked to estimate the likelihood that a statement is true, they search their memory for information that has implications for the validity of this statement. Once this information has been identified, they estimate a) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were true, and b) the likelihood that the statement would be true if the information were false. If their estimates for these two probabilities differ, people average them, weighting each by the likelihood that the information is true and false (respectively). Thus, information bears directly on beliefs of another, related statement.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"&gt;Wyer, R. S., &amp; Albarracin, D. (2005). Belief formation, organization, and change: Cognitive and motivational influences. In D. Albarracin, B. T. Johnson, &amp; M. P. Zanna, The Handbook of Attitudes (273–322). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linear models of belief formation===
Unlike the previous model, this one takes into consideration the possibility of multiple factors influencing belief formation. Using regression procedures, this model predicts belief formation on the basis of several different pieces of information, with weights assigned to each piece on the basis of their relative importance.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

===Information processing models of belief formation and change===
These models address the fact that the responses people have to belief-relevant information is unlikely to be predicted from the objective basis of the information that they can recall at the time their beliefs are reported. Instead, these responses reflect the number and meaning of the thoughts that people have about the message at the time that they encounter it.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 2005"/&gt;

Some influences on people's belief formation include:
* Internalization of beliefs during childhood, which can form and shape our beliefs in different domains. [[Albert Einstein]] is often quoted as having said that "Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen." Political beliefs depend most strongly on the political beliefs most common in the community where we live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Andrew Gelman |first=Andrew |last=Gelman |first2=David |last2=Park |first3=Boris |last3=Shor |first4=Joseph |last4=Bafumi |first5=Jeronimo |last5=Cortina |title=Red State, Blue State, Rich State, Poor State: Why Americans Vote the Way They Do |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-691-13927-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most individuals believe the [[religion]] they were taught in childhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Argyle |title=The Psychology of Religious Behaviour, Belief and Experience |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1997 |isbn=0-415-12330-5 |page=25 |quote=Religion, in most cultures, is ascribed, not chosen. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Charismatic leaders can form and/or modify beliefs (even if those beliefs fly in the face of all previous beliefs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Eric |last=Hoffer |title=The True Believer |location=New York |publisher=Harper Perennial Modern Classics |year=2002 |isbn=0-06-050591-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Is belief voluntary? Rational individuals need to reconcile their direct reality with any said belief; therefore, if belief is not present or possible, it reflects the fact that contradictions were necessarily overcome using [[cognitive dissonance]].
* [[Advertising]] can form or change beliefs through repetition, shock, and association with images of sex, love, beauty, and other strong positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jane |last=Kilbourne |first2=Mary |last2=Pipher |title=Can't Buy My Love: How Advertising Changes the Way We Think and Feel |location= |publisher=Free Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-684-86600-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to intuition, a delay, known as the [[sleeper effect]], instead of immediate succession may increase an advertisement's ability to persuade viewer's beliefs if a discounting cue is present.&lt;ref&gt;see Kumkale &amp; Albarracin, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
* Physical trauma, especially to the head, can radically alter a person's beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Babette |last=Rothschild |title=The Body Remembers: The Psychophysiology of Trauma and Trauma Treatment |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-393-70327-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even educated people, well aware of the process by which beliefs form, still strongly cling to their beliefs, and act on those beliefs even against their own self-interest. In Anna Rowley's book, Leadership Therapy, she states "You want your beliefs to change. It's proof that you are keeping your eyes open, living fully, and welcoming everything that the world and people around you can teach you." This means that peoples' beliefs should evolve as they gain new experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rowley |first=Anna |title=Leadership Therapy: Inside the Mind of Microsoft |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |year=2007 |page=69 |isbn=1-4039-8403-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justified true belief&lt;!--'Justified true belief' redirects here--&gt;==
'''Justified true belief'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a definition of [[knowledge]] that gained approval during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], 'justified' standing in contrast to 'revealed'. There have been attempts to trace it back to [[Plato]] and his dialogues.{{clarify|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;The received view holds it that Plato's theory presents knowledge as remembering eternal truths and justification reawakens memory, see {{cite book |last=Fine |first=G. |chapter=Introduction |title=Plato on Knowledge and Forms: Selected Essays |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-19-924558-4 |pages=5–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of justified true belief states that in order to know that a given proposition is true, one must not only believe the relevant true proposition, but also have justification for doing so. In more formal terms, an agent &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; knows that a proposition &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true [[if and only if]]:
# &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; believes that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true, and
# &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is justified in believing that &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is true

This theory of knowledge suffered a significant setback with the discovery of [[Gettier problem]]s, situations in which the above conditions were seemingly met but that many philosophers disagree that anything is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Chisholm | first = Roderick | title = The Foundations of Knowing | chapter=Knowledge as Justified True Belief |publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-8166-1103-3 |authorlink=Roderick Chisholm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Nozick]] suggested{{Year needed|date=April 2017}} a [[Gettier problems#Fred Dretske's conclusive reasons and Robert Nozick's truth-tracking|clarification]] of "justification" which he believed eliminates the problem: the justification has to be such that were the justification false, the knowledge would be false. Bernecker and Dretske (2000) argue that "no epistemologist since Gettier has seriously and successfully defended the traditional view."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernecker |first=Sven|last2= Dretske|first2= Fred|date= 2000|title= Knowledge. Readings in contemporary epistemology|location= Oxford|publisher= Oxford University Press|page= 3|isbn= 978-0198752615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}  On the other hand, Paul Boghossian argues that the Justified True Belief account is the "standard, widely accepted" definition of knowledge.&lt;ref name="Boghossian on Justification"&gt;{{Citation |publisher = Clarendon Press |publication-place = Oxford, UK |author = Paul Boghossian |url = https://global.oup.com/academic/product/fear-of-knowledge-9780199230419?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp; |title = Fear of Knowledge: Against relativism and constructivism |publication-date = 2007 }}, Chapter2, p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modification==
{{see also|Belief revision}}
An extensive amount of scientific research and philosophical discussion exists around the modification of beliefs, which is commonly referred to as belief revision.
Generally speaking, the process of belief revision entails the believer weighing the set of truths and/or evidence, and the dominance of a set of truths or evidence on an alternative to a held belief can lead to revision.  One process of belief revision is [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian updating]] and is often referenced for its mathematical basis and conceptual simplicity.  However, such a process may not be representative for individuals whose beliefs are not easily characterized as probabilistic.

There are several techniques for individuals or groups to change the beliefs of others; these methods generally fall under the umbrella of [[persuasion]].   Persuasion can take on more specific forms such as  [[consciousness raising]] when considered in an activist or political context.
Belief modification may also occur as a result of the experience of outcomes.  Because [[goal]]s are based, in part on beliefs, the success or failure at a particular goal may contribute to modification of beliefs that supported the original goal.

Whether or not belief modification actually occurs is dependent not only on the extent of truths or evidence for the alternative belief, but also characteristics outside the specific truths or evidence.  This includes, but is not limited to: the source characteristics of the message, such as [[Source credibility|credibility]]; [[Peer pressure|social pressures]]; the anticipated consequences of a modification; or the ability of the individual or group to act on the modification.  Therefore, individuals seeking to achieve belief modification in themselves or others need to consider all possible forms of resistance to belief revision.

==Partial==
Without qualification, "belief" normally implies a lack of [[doubt]], especially insofar as it is a designation of a [[life stance]]. In practical everyday use however, belief is normally partial and retractable with varying degrees of certainty.

A copious literature exists in multiple disciplines to accommodate this reality. In mathematics [[probability]], [[fuzzy logic]], [[fuzzy set theory]], and other topics are largely directed to this.

==Prediction==
Different psychological models have tried to predict people's beliefs and some of them try to estimate the exact probabilities of beliefs. For example, [[Robert S. Wyer|Robert Wyer]] developed a model of subjective probabilities.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |year=1970 |title=Quantitative prediction of belief and opinion change: A further test of a subjective probability model |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1037/h0030064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wyer |first=R. S. |last2=Goldberg |first2=L. |year=1970 |title=A probabilistic analysis of the relationships among beliefs and attitudes |journal=Psychological Review |volume=77 |issue=2 |pages=100–120 |doi=10.1037/h0028769 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When people rate the likelihood of a certain statement (e.g., "It will rain tomorrow"), this rating can be seen as a subjective probability value. The subjective probability model posits that these subjective probabilities follow the same rules as objective probabilities. For example, the [[law of total probability]] might be applied to predict a subjective probability value. Wyer found that this model produces relatively accurate predictions for probabilities of single events and for changes in these probabilities, but that the probabilities of several beliefs linked by "and" or "or" do not follow the model as well.&lt;ref name="Wyer, R. S. 1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WyerGoldberg" /&gt;

==Religion==
[[File:Religion collage updated.jpg|thumb]]
Religious belief refers to attitudes towards [[mythological]], [[supernatural]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] aspects of a [[religion]].{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Religious belief is distinct from [[religious ritual|religious practice]] and from [[religious behaviour]]s – with some believers not practicing [[religion]] and some practitioners not believing religion. Religious beliefs, deriving from ideas that are exclusive to religion,{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} often relate to the existence, characteristics and worship of a [[deity]] or deities, to the idea of [[Miracle|divine intervention]] in the [[universe]] and in [[human life (disambiguation)|human life]], or to the [[deontological]]  explanations for the values and practices centered on the teachings of a [[spiritual leader]] or of a [[spiritual group]]. In contrast to other [[belief system]]s, religious beliefs are usually [[Codification (law)|codified]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology and Religious Belief | publisher = University of California Press | author = Wittgenstein, Ludwig | year = 2007 | pages = 53 | isbn = 0520251814}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forms of religious belief===
A popular view holds that different religions each have identifiable and exclusive sets of beliefs or [[creed]]s, but surveys of religious belief have often found that the official doctrine and descriptions of the beliefs offered by [[religious authority|religious authorities]] do not always agree with the privately held beliefs of those who identify as members of a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = An empiricist's view of the nature of religious belief | publisher = Norwood Editions  (Norwood, Pa.) | author = Braithwaite, R. B. | year = 1975 | isbn = 088305955X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a broad classification of the kinds of religious belief, see below.

====Fundamentalism====
{{Main|Religious fundamentalism}}
First self-applied as a term to the conservative doctrine outlined by anti-modernist [[Protestants]] in the United States of America,&lt;ref name="A.C. Dixon"&gt;{{cite web |date= 2012-11-27 |url = http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |title = 'The Fundamentals: A Testimony to the Truth' |accessdate = 2012-11-28 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121203144842/http://user.xmission.com/~fidelis/volume1/volume1.php |archivedate = 3 December 2012 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; "fundamentalism" in religious terms denotes strict adherence to an interpretation of scriptures that are generally associated with theologically conservative positions or traditional understandings of the text and are distrustful of innovative readings, new revelation, or alternative interpretations.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} Religious fundamentalism has been identified{{by whom|date=November 2017}} in the media as being associated with [[fanaticism|fanatical]] or [[zealotry|zealous]] political movements around the world that have used a strict adherence to a particular religious doctrine as a means to establish political identity and to enforce societal norms.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

====Orthodoxy====
{{Main|Orthodoxy (disambiguation)}}
First used in the context of [[Early Christianity]], the term "orthodoxy" relates to religious belief that closely follows the edicts, [[apologetics|apologies]], and [[hermeneutics]] of a prevailing religious authority. In the case of Early Christianity, this authority was the communion of bishops, and is often referred to by the term "[[Magisterium]]". The term ''orthodox'' was applied{{when|date= November 2017}} almost as an epithet to a group of Jewish believers who held to pre-Enlightenment understanding of Judaism – now known as [[Orthodox Judaism]]. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] of Christianity and the [[Catholic Church]] each consider themselves to be the true heir to Early Christian belief and practice. The antonym of "orthodox" is "[[heterodox]]", and those adhering to orthodoxy often accuse the heterodox of [[apostasy]], [[schism (religion)|schism]], or [[heresy]].

====Modernism/reform====
The [[Renaissance]] and later the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe exhibited varying degrees of [[religious tolerance]] and intolerance towards new and old religious ideas. The ''[[philosophe]]s'' took particular exception to many of the more fantastical claims of religions and directly challenged religious authority and the prevailing beliefs associated with the established churches. In response to the liberalizing political and social movements, some religious groups attempted to integrate Enlightenment ideals of rationality, equality, and individual liberty into their belief systems, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Liberal Christianity]] offer two examples of such religious associations.

====Superstition====
{{Main|Superstition}}
A term signifying derogation that is used by the religious and non-religious alike, "superstition" refers to a  deprecated belief in supernatural causation. Those who deny the existence of the supernatural generally attribute all beliefs associated with it to be superstitious, while a typical religious critique of superstition holds that it either encompasses beliefs in non-existent supernatural activity or that the supernatural activity is inappropriately feared or held in improper regard (see [[idolatry]]). Christian Churches strongly condemned [[occultism]], [[animism]], [[paganism]], and other [[folk religion]]s as mean forms of superstition, though such condemnation did not necessarily eliminate the beliefs among the common people, and many such religious beliefs persist {{as of | 2018 | lc = on | alt = today}}.

====Systemization====
In Buddhism, practice and progress along the [[spiritual path]] happens when one follows the system of [[Buddhist practice]]. Any religion which follows (parts of) the fundamentals of this system has, according to the teachings of Buddha, good aspects to the extent it accords with this system. Any religion which goes against (parts of) the fundamentals of this system includes bad aspects too.{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} Any religion which does not teach certain parts of this system, is not because of this a "bad" religion; it just lacks those teachings and is to that extent incomplete.

A question by the monk Subhadda to the Buddha:
{{quote|"O Gotama, there are [[Shramana|Samana]]s (wandering monks) and [[Brahmin|Brahmanas]] (religious leaders) who are leaders of their sects, who are well-esteemed by many people, such as Purana Kassapa, Makkhali Gosala, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccayana, Sancaya Belatthaputta and [[Mahavira|Nigantha Nataputta]]. Do all of them have knowledge and understanding as they themselves have declared? Or do all of them have no knowledge and understanding?"}}

The Buddha replied:
{{quote|"Subhadda, in whatever teaching is not found the [[Noble Eightfold Path]], neither in it is there found a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Stream-enterer|first stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Once-returner|second stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Non-returner|third stage]], nor a Samana of the [[Four stages of enlightenment#Arahant|fourth stage]]."}}

As a religious tradition, [[Hindu]]ism has experienced many attempts at systemization. In medieval times, [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] advocated for the [[Advaita]] system of philosophy. In recent times, [[Tamala Krishna Gosvami]] has researched the systemization of [[Krishna]] theology as expounded by [[Srila Prabhupada]]. (See [[Krishnology]])

====Universalism====
Some believe that religion cannot be separated from other aspects of life, or believe that certain cultures did not or do not separate their religious activities from other activities in the same way that some people in modern [[Western culture|Western]] cultures do.

Some [[anthropologist]]s{{Who|date=July 2010}} report cultures in which gods are involved in every aspect of [[human condition|life]] – if a cow goes dry, a god has caused this, and must be propitiated; when the sun rises in the morning, a god has caused this, and must be thanked. Even in modern Western cultures, many people see supernatural forces behind every event, as described by [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]''.

People with such a [[worldview]] often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} regard the influence of [[Western culture]] as inimical. Others with this worldview resist the influence of [[science]], and believe that science (or "so-called science") should be guided by religion. Still others with this worldview believe that all political decisions and laws should be guided by religion. This last belief, written into the constitutions of many{{which|date=November 2017}} [[Islam]]ic nations,  is shared by some [[fundamentalist Christians]].

In addition, beliefs about the [[supernatural]] or [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] may not presuppose a difference between any such thing as [[nature]] and non-nature, nor between science and what most educated people believe. In the view of some historians{{Who|date =September 2013}}, the pre-[[Socrates|Socratic]] [[Athenian]]s saw [[science]], political [[tradition]], [[culture]] and religion as not easily distinguishable, but as all part of the same body of [[knowledge]] and [[wisdom]] available to a [[community]].

===Approaches to the beliefs of others===
Adherents of particular religions deal with the differing doctrines and practices espoused by other religions or by other [[religious denomination]]s in a variety of ways.  All strains of thought appear in different segments of all major world religions.

====Exclusivism====
{{See also|Exclusivism}}
People with exclusivist beliefs typically explain other beliefs either as in error, or as corruptions or counterfeits of the [[one true faith|true faith]]. This approach is a fairly consistent feature among smaller [[new religious movement]]s that often rely on doctrine that claims a unique [[revelation]] by the [[Founders of religious traditions|founder]]s or [[leader]]s, and considers it a matter of faith that the "correct" religion has a monopoly on truth. All three major [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic monotheistic religions]] have passages in their holy scriptures that attest to the primacy of the scriptural testimony, and indeed [[monotheism]] itself is often{{quantify|date=June 2018}} vouched{{by whom|date= November 2017}} as an innovation characterized specifically by its explicit rejection of earlier polytheistic faiths.

Some exclusivist faiths incorporate a specific element of [[proselytization]]. This is a strongly-held belief in the Christian tradition which follows the doctrine of the [[Great Commission]], and is less emphasized by the Islamic faith where the [[Quran]]ic edict "There shall be no compulsion in religion" (2:256) is often quoted as a justification for toleration of alternative beliefs. The [[Conversion to Judaism|Jewish tradition]] does not actively seek out converts.

Exclusivism correlates with conservative, fundamentalist, and orthodox approaches of many religions, while pluralistic and syncretist approaches either explicitly downplay or reject the exclusivist tendencies within a religion.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Inclusivism====
People with [[inclusivism|inclusivist]] beliefs recognize some truth in all faith [[system]]s, highlighting agreements and minimizing differences. This attitude is sometimes associated{{by whom|date= November 2017}} with [[Interfaith dialog]]ue or with the Christian [[Ecumenical]] movement, though in principle such attempts at pluralism are not necessarily inclusivist and many actors in such interactions (for example, the [[Roman Catholic Church]]) still hold to exclusivist dogma while participating in inter-religious organizations.

Explicitly inclusivist religions include many that are associated with the [[New Age]] movement, as well as modern reinterpretations of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] considers it doctrine that there is truth in all faith-systems.

====Pluralism====
{{Main|Religious pluralism}}
People with [[religious pluralism|pluralist]] beliefs make no distinction between faith systems, viewing each one as valid within a particular culture.  Examples include:

* Extracts from the Sri [[Guru Granth Sahib]] Ji (Sikh Holy Scriptures), "There is only the One Supreme Lord God; there is no other at all" (Pannaa 45). "By His Power the [[Vedas]] and the [[Purana]]s exist, and the Holy Scriptures of the Jewish, Christian and Islamic religions. By His Power all deliberations exist." (Pannaa 464). "Some call Him, '[[Lord Rama|Ram]], Ram', and some call Him, 'Khudaa-i'. Some serve Him as 'Gusain', others as 'Allaah'. ||1|| He is the Cause of causes, the Generous Lord. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us amen." (Pannaa 885).

====Syncretism====
{{Main|Syncretism}}
People with syncretistic views blend the views of a variety of different religions or traditional beliefs into a unique fusion which suits their particular [[experience]]s and contexts (''see'' [[eclecticism]]). [[Unitarian Universalism]] exemplifies a syncretistic faith.

===Adherence===
{{See also|Existence of God}}
Typical reasons for adherence to religion include the following:

* Some see belief in a deity as necessary for [[Morality|moral behavior]].&lt;ref name="moore"&gt;Compare: {{cite web | date= 2005-03-07 | url = http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2005/110/13.0.html | title = Roy Moore: 'We Have No Morality Without an Acknowledgment of God' | publisher = [[Christianity Today]] | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many{{quantify|date= November 2017}} people regard religious practices as serene, beautiful, and conducive to religious experiences, which in turn support religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last= Miller | first = David Ian | date = 2005-02-15 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/gate/archive/2005/02/15/findrelig.DTL | title = Finding My Religion: Steve Georgiou on his faith and mentor, minimalist poet Robert Lax | publisher =  SFGate | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Organized religions promote a sense of [[Community (disambiguation)|community]] among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people with similar [[values]].&lt;ref name="repa"&gt;{{cite web | last = Repa | first = J. Theodore | date = 1998-10-18 | url = http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | title = Building Community: The Marriage of Religion and Education | accessdate = 2006-05-19 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060907172411/http://pages.nyu.edu/~jtr1/sermon.htm | archive-date = 7 September 2006 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, while religious beliefs and practices are usually connected, some individuals with substantially secular beliefs still participate in religious practices for cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Note for example the concept of a [[cultural Christian]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Each religion asserts that it is a means by which its adherents may come into closer contact with the Divine, with Truth, and with [[spiritual power]]. They all promise to free adherents from spiritual bondage, and to bring them into spiritual freedom.  It naturally follows that a religion which can free its adherents from deception, sin, and spiritual death will have significant mental-health benefits. [[Abraham Maslow]]'s research after [[World War II]] showed that [[the Holocaust|Holocaust]] survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs (not necessarily temple attendance, etc.), suggesting that belief helped people cope in extreme circumstances. [[Humanistic psychology]] went on to investigate how religious or spiritual identity may have correlations with longer lifespan and better health. The study found that humans may particularly need religious ideas to serve various emotional needs such as the need to feel loved, the need to belong to homogeneous groups, the need for understandable explanations and the need for a guarantee of ultimate justice.  Other factors may involve sense of [[purpose]], sense of [[Identity (social science)|identity]], or a sense of contact with the divine. See also ''[[Man's Search for Meaning]]'', by [[Viktor Frankl]], detailing his experience with the importance of religion in surviving the Holocaust. Critics assert that the very fact that religion was the primary selector for research subjects may have introduced a bias, and that the fact that all subjects were Holocaust survivors may also have had an effect. According to Larson et al. (2000), "[m]ore longitudinal research with better multidimensional measures will help further clarify the roles of these [religious] factors and whether they are beneficial or harmful."&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite journal | last= Larson | first = David B. |author2 = Susan S.

Psychologist [[James Alcock]] also summarizes a number of apparent benefits which reinforce religious belief. These include prayer appearing to account for successful resolution of problems, "a bulwark against existential anxiety and fear of annihilation," an increased sense of control, companionship with one's deity, a source of self-significance, and group identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Alcock |first1=James |authorlink1=James Alcock |title=The God Engine |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=32–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical reasons for rejection of religion include:
* Some people regard certain fundamental doctrines of some religions as illogical, contrary to experience, or unsupported by sufficient [[evidence]]; such people may reject one or more religions for those reasons.&lt;ref name="russell"&gt;For example: {{cite web |last= Russell |first = Bertrand |authorlink = Bertrand Russell |date = 1927-03-06 |url = http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |title = Why I am Not a Christian |accessdate = 2006-05-19 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061119081311/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell0.htm |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some believers may have difficulty accepting particular religious assertions or doctrines. Some people believe the body of evidence available to humans to be insufficient to justify certain religious beliefs. They may thus disagree with religious interpretations of ethics and human purpose, or with various [[creation myth]]s. This reason has perhaps{{original research inline|date= November 2017}} been aggravated by the protestations and empases of some [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]].
* Some religions include beliefs that certain groups of people are inferior or sinful and deserve contempt, persecution, or even death, and that non-believers will be punished for their unbelief in an [[after-life]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, some [[Muslim]]s believe that women are inferior to men. Some [[Christian]]s share this belief. At the time of the [[American Civil War]] of 1861-1865, many Southerners used passages from the [[Bible]] to justify race-based [[slavery]]. Certain campaigners have used the Christian religion as a reason to persecute and to deny the rights of homosexuals, on the basis that the Christian biblical God disapproves of homosexuality, and by implication of homosexuals. Compare http://www.godhatesfags.com&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents to a religion may feel antipathy to unbelievers. Numerous examples exist of people of one religion or sect using religion as an excuse to murder people with different religious beliefs. To mention just a few
** the slaughter of the [[Huguenot]]s by French [[Catholics]] in the sixteenth century
** [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s killing each other when [[Pakistan]] separated from India in 1947
** the persecution and killing of [[Shiite]] Muslims by [[Sunni]] Muslims in Iraq
** the murder of [[Protestant]]s by [[Catholics]] and vice versa in [[Ireland]] (both of these examples in the late twentieth century)
** the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] that continues {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}}. - According to some critics of religion, such beliefs can encourage completely unnecessary conflicts and in some cases even wars. Many [[atheist]]s believe that, because of this, religion is incompatible with world peace, freedom, civil rights, equality, and good government. On the other hand, most religions perceive atheism as a threat and will vigorously and even violently{{citation needed|date= November 2017}} defend themselves against religious sterilization, making the attempt to remove public religious practices a source of strife.&lt;ref&gt;Beauchamp, Philip (pseudonym of Jeremy Bentham) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=qiRQAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=Natural+Religion+on+the+Temporal+Happiness+of+Mankind&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=sGJSbzT4Ts&amp;sig=pzV-WU5Jx0cpsVXX08ZU17mL-BE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result#PPA76,M1 ''Analysis of the Influence of Natural Religion on the Temporal Happiness of Mankind''], 1822, R. Carlile, London, at page 76: "Of all human antipathies, that which the believer in a God bears to the unbeliever is the fullest, the most unqualified, and the most universal"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people may be unable to accept the values that a specific religion promotes and will therefore not join that religion. They may also be unable to accept the proposition that those who do not believe will go to hell or be damned, especially if said nonbelievers are close to the person.
* The maintenance of [[Human life (disambiguation)|life]] and the achievement of [[self-esteem]] require of a person the fullest exercise of reason{{citation needed|date= November 2017}}—but morality (people are taught{{by whom|date=November 2017}}) rests on and requires faith.&lt;ref&gt;Faith is the commitment of one's consciousness to beliefs for which one has no sensory evidence or rational proof. When a person rejects reason as their standard of judgment, only one alternative standard allegedly remains to them: feelings. A mystic is a person who treats feelings as tools of cognition. Faith is the equation of feeling with knowledge. To practice the "virtue" of faith, one must (we are told) be willing to suspend one's sight and one's judgment; one must be willing to live with the unintelligible, with that which cannot be conceptualized or integrated into the rest of one's knowledge, and to induce a trance like illusion of understanding. One must allegedly be willing to repress one's critical faculty and hold it as one's guilt; one must be willing to drown any questions that rise in protest—to strangle any trust of [[reason]] convulsively seeking to assert its proper function as the protector of one's life and cognitive integrity. The presumed human need for self-esteem entails the need for a sense of control over reality—but no control is possible in a universe which, by one's own concession, contains the supernatural, the miraculous and the causeless, a universe in which one is at the mercy of ghosts and demons, in which one must deal, not with the unknown, but with the unknowable; no control is possible if a person proposes, but a ghost disposes; no control is possible if the universe is a haunted house. A person's life and self-esteem require that the object and concern of his or her consciousness be reality and this earth—but morality, people are taught, consists of scorning this earth and the world available to sensory perception, and of contemplating, instead, a "different" and "higher" reality, a realm inaccessible to reason and incommunicable in language, but attainable by revelation, by special dialectical processes, by that superior state of intellectual lucidity known to Zen-Buddhists as "No-Mind," or by death. A person's life and self-esteem require that this person take pride in their power to think, pride in their power to live—but morality, people are taught, holds pride, and specifically intellectual pride, as the gravest of sins. Virtue begins, people are taught, with humility: with the recognition of the helplessness, the smallness, the impotence of one's mind. A person's life and self-esteem purportedly require the person to be loyal to their values, loyal to their mind and its judgments, loyal to their life—but the essence of morality, people are taught, consists of self-sacrifice: the sacrifice of one's mind to some higher authority, and the sacrifice of one's values to whoever may claim to require it. A sacrifice, it is necessary to remember, means the surrender of a higher value in favor of a lower value or of a nonvalue. If one gives up that which one does not value in order to obtain that which one does value—or if one gives up a lesser value in order to  obtain a greater one—this is not a sacrifice, but a gain. Remember further that all of a person's values allegedly exist in a hierarchy; people value some things more than others; and, to the extent that a person is rational, the hierarchical order of the person's values is rational: that is, the person values things in proportion to their importance in serving this person's life and well-being. That which is inimical to their life and well-being, that which is inimical to their nature and needs as a living being, the person disvalues. Conversely, one of the characteristics of mental illness is a distorted value structure; the neurotic does not value things according to their objective merit, in relation to the person's nature and needs; they frequently value the very things that will lead them to self-destruction. Judged by objective standards, they are engaged in a chronic process of self-sacrifice. But if sacrifice is a virtue, it is not the neurotic but the rational person who must be “cured”. They must learn to do violence to their own rational judgment—to reverse the order of their value hierarchy—to surrender that which their mind has chosen as the good—to turn against and invalidate their own consciousness.{{cite book

==Systems==
A '''belief system''' is a set of mutually supportive beliefs. The beliefs of any such system can be classified as [[Religious belief|religious]], [[Philosophy|philosophical]], [[politics|political]], [[Ideology|ideological]], or a combination of these. Philosopher [[Jonathan Glover]] says that beliefs are always part of a belief system, and that tenanted belief systems are difficult for the tenants to completely revise or reject.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth A. Minton, Lynn R. Khale|title=Belief Systems, Religion, and Behavioral Economics|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=Business Expert Press LLC|isbn=978-1-60649-704-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gilbert, sociological perspectives===
A collective belief is referred to when people speak of what 'we' believe when this is not simply elliptical for what 'we all' believe.

[[Sociology|Sociologist]] [[Émile Durkheim]] wrote of collective beliefs and proposed that they, like all '[[social fact]]s', 'inhered in' social [[Group (sociology)|groups]] as opposed to individual persons. Durkheim's discussion of collective belief, though suggestive, is relatively obscure.

[[Philosophy|Philosopher]] [[Margaret Gilbert]] has offered a related account in terms of the joint commitment of a number of persons to accept a certain belief as a body. According to this account, individuals who together collectively believe something need not personally believe it themselves.  Gilbert's work on the topic has stimulated a developing literature among philosophers. One question that has arisen is whether and how philosophical accounts of belief in general need to be sensitive to the possibility of collective belief.

===Glover===
Jonathan Glover believes that he and other philosophers ought to play some role in starting dialogues between people with deeply held, opposing beliefs, especially if there is risk of violence. Glover also believes that philosophy can offer insights about beliefs that would be relevant to such dialogue.

[[File:Snipa.JPG|thumb|right|240px|Philosopher Jonathan Glover warns that belief systems are like whole boats in the water; it is extremely difficult to alter them all at once (e.g., it may be too stressful, or people may maintain their biases without realizing it).&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;]]
Glover suggests that beliefs have to be considered holistically, and that no belief exists in isolation in the mind of the believer. It always implicates and relates to other beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; Glover provides the example of a patient with an illness who returns to a doctor, but the doctor says that the prescribed medicine is not working. At that point, the patient has a great deal of flexibility in choosing what beliefs to keep or reject: the patient could believe that the doctor is incompetent, that the doctor's assistants made a mistake, that the patient's own body is unique in some unexpected way, that Western medicine is ineffective, or even that Western science is entirely unable to discover truths about ailments.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover maintains that any person can continue to hold any belief if they would really like to&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt; (e.g., with help from [[ad hoc hypotheses]]). One belief can be held fixed, and other beliefs will be altered around it. Glover warns that some beliefs may not be entirely [[Explicit memory|explicitly]] believed (e.g., some people may not realize they have racist belief systems adopted from their environment as a child). Glover believes that people tend to first realize that beliefs can change, and may be contingent on their upbringing, around age 12 or 15.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover emphasizes that beliefs are difficult to change. He says that one may try to rebuild one's beliefs on more secure foundations ([[axioms]]), like building a new house, but warns that this may not be possible. Glover offers the example of [[René Descartes]], saying about Descartes that "[h]e starts off with the characteristic beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman; he then junks the lot, he rebuilds the system, and somehow it looks a lot like the beliefs of a 17th-century Frenchman." To Glover, belief systems are not like houses but are instead like boats. As Glover puts it: "Maybe the whole thing needs rebuilding, but inevitably at any point you have to keep enough of it intact to keep floating."&lt;ref name=BitesGlover/&gt;

Glover's final message is that if people talk about their beliefs, they may find more deep, relevant, philosophical ways in which they disagree (e.g., less obvious beliefs, or more deeply held beliefs). Glover thinks that people often manage to find agreements and consensus through philosophy. He says that at the very least, if people do not convert each other, they will hold their own beliefs more openmindedly and will be less likely to go to war over conflicting beliefs.&lt;ref name=BitesGlover&gt;[http://philosophybites.com/2011/10/jonathan-glover-on-systems-of-belief.html "Jonathan Glover on systems of belief", Philosophy Bites Podcast, Oct 9 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GloverBeliefs&gt;[http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts/philosophy-beliefs-and-conflicts '' 'Philosophy, Beliefs, and Conflict' '', JonathanGlover.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law===
The British philosopher [[Stephen Law]] has described some belief systems (including belief in [[homeopathy]], [[psychic powers]], and [[alien abduction]]) as "[[wiktionary:claptrap|claptrap]]" and said that they "draw people in and hold them captive so they become willing slaves to victory... if you get sucked in, it can be extremely difficult to think your way clear again".&lt;ref&gt;''[[New Scientist]]'' (magazine), 11 June 2011 [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21028160.200-a-field-guide-to-bullshit.html A field guide to bullshit | New Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2710">'''Brinkler Classification''' is the [[library classification]] system  of [[Bartol Brinkler]] described in his article "The Geographical Approach to Materials in the Library of Congress Subject Headings".&lt;ref&gt;Brinkler, Bartol. The geographical approach to materials in the Library of Congress subject headings: report of a study project. s.l.: s.n., 1960. [Accession No: {{OCLC|3853830}}].&lt;/ref&gt; The geographical aspect of a subject may be conveyed through three types of headings labeled A, B, and C. Heading A uses a primary topical description with geographical subdivisions (e.g. Art—Paris).  Type B uses a place-name for the main heading with a topical subdivision (e.g. Paris—Description). C headings use a geographical description of a phrase (e.g. Paris Literature).  

Brinkler explores what type of heading is more useful to a [[patron]], and he finds that it depends on the level of familiarity a patron has with a topic and what approach they take when searching for resources on their topic. Ideally readers will either be looking for everything on a particular topic, or everything regarding a particular place. Bartol Brinkler investigates a system of classification that will best serve these two ideal types of patrons.  He finds working with Type A headings will best assist a patron who is more topic oriented, while using Type B headings is preferable for those who are primarily interested in one place. 

However this is problematic in practice. One possibility is to assign Type A and Type B headings to every resource, but the cataloguing cost would be high.  A system that aids readers regardless of their approach to a topic involves using cross-references (e.g. Canada—Botany, See Botany—Canada).  Admitting that see and see also references would require more work on the part of librarians, Bartol Brinkler notes that librarians must keep in mind "...readers do not have the same knowledge [of classification] and do need all the help they can get..."{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The '''Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development''' ('''CIPD''') is a professional association for [[human resource management]] professionals. It is headquartered in [[Wimbledon, London]], England. The organisation was founded in 1913 - it is the world's oldest association in its field and has over 145,000 members internationally working across private, public and voluntary sectors. Peter Cheese was announced in June 2012 as CIPD's new [[CEO]] from July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personneltoday.com/articles/16/05/2012/58539/cipd-appoints-peter-cheese-as-new-chief-executive.htm/ Personnel Today] "CIPD Appoints Peter Cheese as new chief executive" 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/cipd-hr-profession/whats-new/] CIPD What's New&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the United Kingdom, factory inspectors were appointed for the first time in 1893. In 1896 to look after its women and child workers [[Rowntree's]] appointed their first inspector - a Mrs E M Wood.  [[Edward Cadbury]] of [[Cadbury Brothers]] in 1909 called together employers to discuss industrial welfare work and as a result 25 employers formed an association with Mrs Wood of Rowntree's as Secretary. The work of 'welfare  workers' came to public attention during a trade show in 1912 at [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]] in London.&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;

The forerunner of the CIPD, the '''Welfare Workers' Association''' (WWA) was formed at an employers' conference in York on 6 June 1913. The meeting was chaired by [[Seebohm Rowntree]]. Alongside his company, Rowntree's around fifty other companies were present including; [[Boots UK|Boots]], Cadbury and [[Chivers and Sons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehrdirector.com/business-news/hr_in_business/duplicate-of-alarming-bad-data-habits/ HRD Happy 100th anniversary CIPD], Accessed 09 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-four of the employers present&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Human-Resources-in-Organisations/9780273643999.page | title=Human Resources in Organisations | publisher=[[Pearson Education]] / [[Financial Times Press]] | author=John Leopold | year=2002 | isbn=0-273-64399-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided that the WWA be founded as...''an association of  employers interested in industrial betterment and of welfare workers engaged by them''. The outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914 led to many women and children taking up the work of men, particularly in the larger munition factories where the appointment of welfare officers was made compulsory by legislation and was monitored by the '''Health of Munition Workers Committee'''. This led to the rapid expansion of female welfare workers. There were concerns about the training of welfare staff, and in 1917, at a gathering in Leeds of the seven welfare associations formed during the period it was agreed that they merge by forming the '''Central Association of Welfare Workers''' which to accommodate the regional associations established the beginnings of a local branch structure. The Association's position was also enhanced during the war years by nationally driven encouragement of workers to join [[trade union]]s to reduce the occurrence of industrial strife. Another development which increased the numbers of company staff dealing with labour and welfare matters occurred with the inclusion of managers, mainly men, from the '''North-western Area Industrial Association''' to assist with discipline, dismissal and industrial relations in increasingly unionised organisations.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; In 1918, to avoid confusion as to its purpose the Association changed its name to the '''Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial)''' ('''CAWWI''').&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory" /&gt;

Another important event which had a recurring impact on the activities of the CAWWI occurred in 1918 when the Rev. [[Robert Hyde (social reformer)|Robert Hyde]] founded the Boys’ Welfare Association soon after renamed the [[Industrial Welfare Society]] (IWS) with six employers who were concerned with the welfare of boys employed or apprenticed in the shipbuilding industry. From the outset there was a strained relationship between the two bodies which continued right through the inter-war period until resolved in 1946. Though both organisations were concerned with 'welfare at work' the CAWWI developed as an institution for practitioners and the IWS was established as a membership body for employers and there was strong disagreement on how best to bring about improvements in workplace conditions and workers' welfare. The IWS later became the [[Industrial Society]] and is now known as the [[Work Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;[http://vistas.uwl.ac.uk/379/1/Alastair_Evans_-_PhD.pdf Labour Management vs Welfare Work Alistair Evans PHd Thesis], [[University of West London]], 2003, Retrieved 10 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===The post-World War I period===
In November 1919, following merger with welfare associations for men the Central Association of Welfare Workers (Industrial) was renamed the '''Welfare Workers' Institute''' and now had a membership of 700.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; However, the next five years saw a reduction in membership to 250 coinciding with the rapid collapse in industrial output as the government sought to reduce the [[national debt]]. Again in 1924 on incorporation the organisation changed its name to the '''Institute of Industrial Welfare Workers''' ('''IIWW'''). [[Minnie Louise Haskins]], the author of the famous poem ''[[The Gate of the Year]]'' and a lecturer at [[London School of Economics|LSE]], was closely involved with the IIWW and edited its monthly bulletin.  As a consequence of the activities of welfare workers during the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike of 1926]] distrust in the welfare movement grew amongst trade unions which saw a new breed of 'labour managers' part of 'management' which was reflected in 1931 when the IIWW became the '''Institute of Labour Management''' and its magazine, rebranded ''Labour Management''. Members of the institute experienced new demands during the 1930s. Firstly, economic growth resulted in a shortfall in skilled labour as companies competed to recruit workers. Secondly, this was followed by lay-offs and industrial action as a worldwide depression took hold, particularly in the industrially-focussed north of England. This influence also had the effect of increasing the number of male members of the institute which significantly shifted the gender balance of the membership.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; Thirdly, new human relations practices developed in the US were finding their way into more enlightened business which invested in their employees through training and provision of such things as salary benefits, pensions and paid holidays. In 1938 the first of the institute branches opened in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 1939 membership stood at 760.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; Mirroring the First World War during [[World War II]], the government insisted on [[personnel manager|personnel officer]]s to be deployed in factories engaged in war-related production.&lt;ref name="Millerson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory" /&gt;

===The latter part of 20th century===
Directly after the Second World War the incoming [[Attlee ministry|Labour government]] instigated a policy of industry nationalization and launched the [[National Health Service]], further increasing the role of personnel professions in handling public sector recruitment, retention, payroll, training, and industrial relations issues. The enlightened practices of large American corporations, some of which had adopted the ideas of human relations thinkers, such as [[Elton Mayo]], and the [[Civil Service]] in the field of [[personnel management]] were being taken up by the larger UK companies. Both influences were reflected in a further change of name in 1946 to the '''Institute of Personnel Management''' (IPM).&lt;ref name="Millerson"&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VcGAAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=welfare+workers+association+1913&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Fc3YVNS0O5H3atD_gJgK&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=welfare%20workers%20association%201913&amp;f=false Qualifying Associations IIs by Geoffrey Millerson], Accessed 09 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1950s were marked by government efforts to improve productivity both through introducing more modern management practices and increase labor supply through encouraging migration of people from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] also known as the [[Windrush generation]]. In 1955, responding to these changes, the IPM sought to increase the professional standards and standing of its members by introducing an externally moderated examination scheme, and restricting entry to full membership to fully qualified or practising personnel officers over age 35 with several years' experience. Membership in 1956 stood at 3,979.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt;

During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s influences on the UK workplace ranged from a series of technological revolutions, economic pressures from entry into the [[Common Market]] and impact of globalization, deregulation of the financial services industry (the Big Bang). Government intervention in industrial relations and the growth of health and safety, equality, collective and recruitment and employment legislation encouraged new specialisms to develop in the function.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; In some companies a shift was seen from reactive personnel management processes towards what became known as strategic human resource management practices, or in shorthand HRM. All these factors also influenced a steady increase in membership, which in 1987 was 31,400.&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; The IPM underwent a period of contemplation during which it considered whether; to shift towards an HRM approach as its counterpart in the US the [[Society for Human Resource Management]] had already done, or to maintain its focus on the more traditional personnel management practices where the majority of its members still operated, or find a third way reflecting a more UK-focused approach. In 1994, a merger took place between the IPM and the Institute of Training and Development (ITD). The new organisation which had 70,000 members&lt;ref name="HRinOrgs" /&gt; was named the Institute of Personnel and Development (IPD), sought to represent the range of professionals engaged in one or more elements of people management.&lt;ref name="CIPDhistory"&gt;[http://www.cipd.co.uk/cipd-hr-profession/centenary/timeline.aspx A potted history of work-related ideas and events CIPD June 1913], Accessed 09 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code morphing''' is an approach used in [[obfuscating software]] to protect [[software]] applications from [[reverse engineering]], analysis, modifications, and cracking. This technology protects intermediate level code such as compiled from Java and .NET languages ([[Oxygene (programming language)|Oxygene]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Visual Basic]], etc.) rather than binary [[object file|object code]]. Code morphing breaks up the protected code into several processor commands or small command snippets and replaces them by others, while maintaining the same end result. Thus the protector obfuscates the code at the intermediate level.

Code morphing is a multilevel technology containing hundreds of unique code transformation patterns. In addition this technology transforms some intermediate layer commands into [[virtual machine]] commands (like [[UCSD p-System|p-code]]). Code morphing does not protect against runtime tracing, which can reveal the execution logic of any protected code.

Unlike other code protectors, there is no concept of code decryption with this method.  Protected code blocks are always in the executable state, and they are executed (interpreted) as transformed code. The original intermediate code is absent to a certain degree, but deobfuscation can still give a clear view of the original code flow.

Code morphing is also used to refer to the [[just-in-time compilation]] technology used in [[Transmeta]] processors such as the [[Transmeta Crusoe|Crusoe]] and [[Transmeta Efficeon|Efficeon]] to implement the [[x86]] instruction set architecture.  

Code morphing is often used in obfuscating the [[copy protection]] or other checks that a program makes to determine whether it is a valid, authentic installation, or an [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copy]], in order to make the removal of the copy-protection code more difficult than would otherwise be the case.

'''Coercion''' ({{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|ˈ|ɜr|ʒ|ən|,_|-|ʃ|ən}}) is the practice of forcing another party to act in an involuntary manner by use of [[threat]]s or force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coercion|title=Definition of coercion|work=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves a set of various types of forceful actions that violate the [[free will]] of an individual to induce a desired response, for example: a bully demanding lunch money from a student or the student gets beaten. These actions may include [[extortion]], [[blackmail]], [[torture]], threats to induce favors, or even [[sexual assault]]. In law, coercion is codified as a [[duress]] crime. Such actions are used as leverage, to force the victim to act in a way contrary to their own interests. Coercion may involve the actual infliction of physical pain/injury or psychological harm in order to enhance the [[credibility]] of a threat. The threat of further harm may lead to the [[co-operation|cooperation]] or [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] of the person being coerced.

==Overview==
The purpose of coercion is to substitute one's aims to those of the victim. For this reason, many social philosophers have considered coercion as the polar opposite to [[Political freedom|freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wg1dvc2lfcEC&amp;pg=PA160&amp;lpg=PA160&amp;dq=%22The+purpose+of+coercion+is+to+substitute+one's+aims+to+those+of+the+victim.+For+this+reason,+many+social+philosophers+have+considered+coercion+as+the+polar+opposite+to+freedom%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20purpose%20of%20coercion%20is%20to%20substitute%20one's%20aims%20to%20those%20of%20the%20victim.%20For%20this%20reason,%20many%20social%20philosophers%20have%20considered%20coercion%20as%20the%20polar%20opposite%20to%20freedom%22&amp;f=false|title=Textbook on Legal Language and Legal Writing|last=Bhatia|first=Prof Dr K. L.|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Universal Law Publishing|isbn=9788175348943|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various forms of coercion are distinguished: first on the basis of the ''kind of injury'' threatened, second according to its ''aims'' and ''scope'', and finally according to its ''effects'', from which its legal, social, and ethical implications mostly depend.

===Physical===
Physical coercion is the most commonly considered form of coercion, where the content of the conditional threat is the [[use of force]] against a victim, their relatives or property. An often used example is "putting a gun to someone's head" (''at gunpoint'') or putting a "knife under the throat" (''at knifepoint'' or cut-throat) to compel action or the victim gets killed or injured. These are so common that they are also used as metaphors for other forms of coercion.

Armed forces in many countries use [[firing squad]]s to maintain [[discipline]] and intimidate the masses, or opposition, into submission or silent [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. However, there also are nonphysical forms of coercion, where the threatened injury does not immediately imply the use of force. Byman and Waxman (2000) define coercion as "the use of threatened force, including the limited use of actual force to back up the threat, to induce an adversary to behave differently than it otherwise would."&lt;ref&gt;Byman, Daniel L.; Waxman, Matthew C.: ''Kosovo and the Great Air Power Debate'', ''[[International Security]]'', Vol. 24, No. 4 (Spring, 2000), pp. 5–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Coercion does not in many cases amount to destruction of property or life since compliance is the goal.

===Psychological===
In [[psychological coercion]], the threatened injury regards the victim's relationships with other people. The most obvious example is ''[[blackmail]]'', where the threat consists of the dissemination of damaging information. However, many other types are possible e.g. "[[emotional blackmail]]", which typically involves threats of rejection from or disapproval by a peer-group, or creating feelings of guilt/obligation via a display of anger or hurt by someone whom the victim loves or respects. Another example is [[coercive persuasion]].

Psychological coercion – along with the other varieties – was extensively and systematically used by the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] during the "Thought Reform" campaign of 1951–1952. The process – carried out partly at "revolutionary universities" and partly within prisons – was investigated and reported upon by [[Robert Jay Lifton]], then Research Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University: see Lifton (1961). The techniques used by the Chinese authorities included a technique derived from standard [[group psychotherapy]], which was aimed at forcing the victims (who were generally intellectuals) to produce detailed and sincere ideological "confessions". For instance, a professor of [[formal logic]] called Chin Yueh-lin – who was then regarded as China's leading authority on his subject – was induced to write: "The new philosophy [of [[Marxism-Leninism]]], being scientific, is the supreme truth" [Lifton (1961) p.&amp;nbsp;545].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4076">'''Community-based conservation''' is a [[conservation movement]] that emerged in the 1980s through escalating protests and subsequent dialogue with local communities affected by international attempts to protect the [[biodiversity]] of the earth. Older conservation movements disregarded the interests of local inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Brockington, D. (2002) Fortress Conservation: The Preservation of the Mkomazi Game Reserve, Tanzania. International African Institute, Oxford( {{ISBN|0-253-34079-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the [[Western culture|Western]] idea on which the conservation movement was founded, of [[nature]] being separate from [[culture]]. The object of community-based conservation is to incorporate improvement to the lives of local people while conserving areas through the creation of national parks or wildlife refuges.&lt;ref&gt;Gezon, Lisa. (1997) Institutional structure and the effectiveness of integrated conservation and development projects: case study from Madagascar, Human Organization 56(4), pp. 462–470 (ISSN 0093-2930)&lt;/ref&gt;  While there have been some notable successes, unfortunately community-based conservation has often been ineffective because of inadequate resources, uneven implementation, and over-wishful planning.  Some critics have also complained about often unintended [[neocolonialism|neocolonialist]] undertones involved in the particular conservation projects.

==History==
The first protected areas around the world such as Yosemite in 1864 and Yellowstone National Park in 1872 were founded by the colonial or classical conservation method.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; Classical conservation created protected areas to protect wilderness and wildlife areas of pristine wilderness that was untouched and uninhabited by humans. All people inhabiting these areas were removed from the land and displaced onto marginal land surrounding or near by the newly protected land. It is estimated that 20 million people were displaced from their land.&lt;ref&gt;Veit, P. G., Benson, C. (2004) When Parks and People Collide. Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs. 16 Oct. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This conservation strategy was used widely until the 1970s when indigenous people started to fight for their rights and land. In 1975 the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the World Parks Congress recognized the rights of indigenous people and to recognize their rights of the protected areas.&lt;ref&gt;Cholchester, M. (2004) Conservation Policy and Indigenous Peoples. Environmental Science &amp; Policy 7(3), pp.145-153&lt;/ref&gt; More policy changes came about that increased the rights of indigenous people. Community-based conservation came into action from these changes.

==Strategies==
One strategy of community-based conservation is co-management or joint management of a protected area. Co-management combines local peoples’ traditional knowledge of the environment with modern scientific knowledge of scientists.&lt;ref&gt;WPC Recommendation 25 Co-management of Protected Areas, World Parks Congress (2003) {{cite web |url=http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927164214/http://www.cceia.org/resources/publications/dialogue/2_11/section_2/4449.html |archivedate=2006-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Child, B.;Jones, B. (2006), Practical tools for community conservation in southern Africa, Participatory Learning and Action 55 (ISSN 1357-938X)&lt;/ref&gt; This combination of knowledge can lead to increased biodiversity and better management of the protected area.

A '''continual improvement process''', also often called a '''continuous improvement process''' (abbreviated as '''CIP''' or '''CI'''), is an ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes. These efforts can seek "[[incrementalism|incremental]]" improvement over time or "breakthrough" improvement all at once.&lt;ref&gt;ASQ: Learn About Quality &amp;#x2014; http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/continuous-improvement/overview/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt; Delivery (customer valued) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.

Some see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as [[business process management]], [[quality management]], [[project management]], and [[program management]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://flevy.com/operational-excellence | title=Operational Excellence | publisher=Flevy | accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[W. Edwards Deming]], a pioneer of the field, saw it as part of the 'system' whereby feedback from the process and customer were evaluated against organisational goals. The fact that it can be called a management process does not mean that it needs to be executed by 'management'; but rather merely that it makes decisions about the implementation of the delivery process and the design of the delivery process itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asq.org/learn-about-quality/continuous-improvement/overview/overview.html | title=Continuous Improvement | publisher=American Society for Quality | accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A broader definition is that of the [[Institute of Quality Assurance]] who defined "continuous improvement as a gradual never-ending change which is: '... focused on increasing the effectiveness and/or efficiency of an organisation to fulfil its policy and objectives. It is not limited to quality initiatives. Improvement in business strategy, business results, customer, employee and supplier relationships can be subject to continual improvement. Put simply, it means ‘getting better all the time’.' "&lt;ref name=FryerAntonyDouglas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.filekadeh.ir/wp-content/uploads/edd/2014/02/2.pdf |title=Critical success factors of continuous improvement in the public sector: A literature review and some key findings |last1=Fryer |first1=Karen J. |last2=Antony |first2=Jiju |last3=Douglas |first3=Alex |journal=Total Quality Management |volume=19 |number=5 |pages=497–517 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|498}}

==Kaizen==
Some successful implementations use the approach known as [[kaizen]] (the translation of kai (“change”) zen (“good”) is “improvement”). This method became famous from [[Masaaki Imai|Imai]]'s 1986 book ''Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success.''&lt;ref name = kaizen-1986 /&gt;
* Feedback: The core principle of CIP is the (self) reflection of processes.
* Efficiency: The purpose of CIP is the identification, reduction, and elimination of suboptimal processes. 
* Evolution: The emphasis of CIP is on incremental, continual steps rather than giant leaps.

Key features of kaizen include:
* Improvements are based on many small changes rather than the radical changes that might arise from Research and Development
* As the ideas come from the workers themselves, they are less likely to be radically different, and therefore easier to implement
* Small improvements are less likely to require major capital investment than major process changes
* The ideas come from the talents of the existing workforce, as opposed to using research, consultants or equipment – any of which could be very expensive
* All employees should continually be seeking ways to improve their own performance
* It helps encourage workers to take ownership for their work, and can help reinforce team working, thereby improving worker motivation.

The elements above are the more tactical elements of CIP. The more strategic elements include deciding how to increase the value of the delivery process output to the customer (effectiveness) and how much flexibility is valuable in the process to meet changing needs.&lt;ref name = kaizen-1986&gt;{{cite book | last=Imai | first=Masaaki | year=1986 | title = Kaizen: The Key to Japan's Competitive Success | publisher=McGraw-Hill/Irwin | ISBN=0-07-554332-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Imai | first=Masaaki | year = 1997 | title=Gemba Kaizen: A Commonsense, Low-Cost Approach to Management | edition = 1st  | publisher=McGraw-Hill |ISBN = 0-07-031446-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In environmental management==
The CIP-concept is also used in [[Environmental management system|environmental management systems (EMS)]], such as [[ISO 14000]] and [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]].  The term "continual improvement", not "continuous improvement", is used in [[ISO 14000]], and is understood to refer to an ongoing series of small or large-scale improvements which are each done discretely, i.e. in a step-wise fashion.  Several differences exist between the CIP concept as it is applied in quality management and environmental management.  CIP in EMS aims to improve the natural consequences of products and activities, not the products and activities as such.  Secondly, there is no client-orientation in EMS-related CIP.  Also, CIP in EMS is not limited to small, incremental improvements as in [[Kaizen]], it also includes innovations of any scale.&lt;ref&gt;Gastl, René: [http://www.envirocip.com/downloadables/summary-of-basic-cip-concept.html CIP in Environmental Management] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212193340/http://www.envirocip.com/downloadables/summary-of-basic-cip-concept.html |date=2011-02-12 }}, an Abstract of Gastl, René: Kontinuierliche Verbesserung im Umweltmanagement, 2nd Ed, 2009, vdf, Zurich&lt;/ref&gt;

==ISO change from "continuous" to "continual"==
In the late 1990s, the developers of the [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2000]] standard—which addressed quality management systems and principles—debated whether or not to update the use of the word "continuous" to "continual".&lt;ref name="RussellContinual03"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qualitywbt.org/FlexTraining/ASP/content/sections/A12/pdfs/01al-vs-ous.pdf |format=PDF |title=Continual Improvement Auditing |author=Russel, J.P. |date=2003 |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MasséContinuous14"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.lean.org/FuseTalk/Forum/messageview.cfm?catid=45&amp;threadid=7018 |title=Continuous vs Continual |author=Massé, K. |publisher=Lean Enterprise Institute |date=3 April 2014 |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HycomTerms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hycom.in/terms_conc.html |title=Why does ISO 9001 use 'continual' improvement vs 'continuous' improvement? |work=Terms &amp; Concepts |publisher=Hycom Solutions |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ISO/TC 176|ISO Technical Committee 176]] and regulatory representatives ultimately decided that "continuous was unenforceable because it meant an organization had to improve minute by minute, whereas, continual improvement meant step-wise improvement or improvement in segments".&lt;ref name="RussellContinual03" /&gt; The committee reportedly did not base the change on dictionary definitions or the standard's vocabulary.&lt;ref name="RussellContinual03" /&gt; This change ran contrary to the common usage of "continuous" in the standard and other prior business management documentation.&lt;ref name="MasséContinuous14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MCTSTheContin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcts.com/Continual-vs-Continuous.htm |title=The Continual Improvement vs. Continuous Improvement Dilemma... |publisher=Management Coaching &amp; Training Services |accessdate=6 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], the '''dimension''' of a [[mathematical space]] (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of [[coordinates]] needed to specify any [[Point (geometry)|point]] within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |title=Curious About Astronomy |publisher=Curious.astro.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111191053/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=4 |archivedate=2014-01-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |title=MathWorld: Dimension |publisher=Mathworld.wolfram.com |date=2014-02-27 |accessdate=2014-03-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325220941/http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Dimension.html |archivedate=2014-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a [[Line (geometry)|line]] has a dimension of one because only one coordinate is needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, the point at 5 on a number line. A [[Surface (topology)|surface]] such as a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] or the surface of a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] or [[sphere]] has a [[two-dimensional space|dimension of two]] because two coordinates are needed to specify a point on it{{spndash}}for example, both a [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] are required to locate a point on the surface of a sphere. The inside of a [[cube]], a cylinder or a sphere is [[three-dimensional]] because three coordinates are needed to locate a point within these spaces.

In [[classical mechanics]], [[space]] and [[time]] are different categories and refer to [[absolute space and time]]. That conception of the world is a [[four-dimensional space]] but not the one that was found necessary to describe [[electromagnetism]]. The four dimensions of [[spacetime]] consist of [[event (relativity)|event]]s that are not absolutely defined spatially and temporally, but rather are known relative to the motion of an [[observer (special relativity)|observer]]. [[Minkowski space]] first approximates the universe without [[gravity]]; the [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]]s of [[general relativity]] describe spacetime with matter and gravity. Ten dimensions are used to describe [[string theory]], eleven dimensions can describe [[supergravity]] and [[M-theory]], and the state-space of [[quantum mechanics]] is an infinite-dimensional [[function space]].

The concept of dimension is not restricted to physical objects. '''{{vanchor|High-dimensional space|N-dimensional space|n dimensional space}}s''' frequently occur in mathematics and the sciences. They may be [[parameter space]]s or [[Configuration space (mathematics)|configuration space]]s such as in [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] or [[Hamiltonian mechanics]]; these are abstract [[space (mathematics)|space]]s, independent of the physical [[space]] we live in.

== In mathematics ==

In mathematics, the dimension of an object is, roughly speaking, the number of [[degrees of freedom]] of a point that moves on this object. In other words, the dimension is the number of independent [[parameter]]s or [[coordinates]] that are needed for defining the position of a point that is constrained to be on the object. For example, the dimension of a point is zero; the dimension of a [[line (geometry)|line]] is one, as a point can move on a line in only one direction (or its opposite); the dimension of a [[plane (geometry)|plane]] is two, etc.

The dimension is an intrinsic property of an object, in the sense that it is independent of the dimension of the space in which the object is or can be embedded. For example, a [[curve]], such as a [[circle]] is of dimension one, because the position of a point on a curve is determined by its signed distance along the curve to a fixed point on the curve. This is independent from the fact that a curve cannot be embedded in a [[Euclidean space]] of dimension lower than two, unless if it is a line.

The dimension of [[Euclidean space|Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space]] {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }}is {{math|''n''}}. When trying to generalize to other types of spaces, one is faced with the question "what makes {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} {{math|''n''}}-dimensional?" One answer is that to cover a fixed [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} by small balls of radius {{math|''ε''}}, one needs on the order of {{math|''ε''&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} such small balls. This observation leads to the definition of the [[Minkowski dimension]] and its more sophisticated variant, the [[Hausdorff dimension]], but there are also other answers to that question. For example, the boundary of a ball in {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; }} looks locally like {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sup&gt; }} and this leads to the notion of the [[inductive dimension]]. While these notions agree on {{math|'''E'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, they turn out to be different when one looks at more general spaces.

A [[tesseract]] is an example of a four-dimensional object. Whereas outside mathematics the use of the term "dimension" is as in: "A tesseract ''has four dimensions''", mathematicians usually express this as: "The tesseract ''has dimension 4''", or: "The dimension of the tesseract ''is'' 4".

Although the notion of higher dimensions goes back to [[René Descartes]], substantial development of a higher-dimensional geometry only began in the 19th century, via the work of [[Arthur Cayley]], [[William Rowan Hamilton]], [[Ludwig Schläfli]] and [[Bernhard Riemann]]. Riemann's 1854 [[Habilitationsschrift]], Schläfli's 1852 ''Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität'', and Hamilton's discovery of the [[quaternion]]s and [[John T. Graves]]' discovery of the [[octonion]]s in 1843 marked the beginning of higher-dimensional geometry.

The rest of this section examines some of the more important mathematical definitions of dimension.

===Vector spaces===
{{main|Dimension (vector space)}}
The dimension of a [[vector space]] is the number of vectors in any [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] for the space, i.e. the number of coordinates necessary to specify any vector. This notion of dimension (the [[cardinality]] of a basis) is often referred to as the ''Hamel dimension'' or ''algebraic dimension'' to distinguish it from other notions of dimension.  

For the non-[[free module|free]] case, this generalizes to the notion of the [[length of a module]].

===Manifolds===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Ball (mathematics)]]--&gt;
The uniquely defined dimension of every [[Connectedness|connected]] topological [[manifold]] can be calculated. A connected topological manifold is [[Local property|locally]] [[homeomorphic]] to Euclidean {{math|''n''}}-space, in which the number {{math|''n''}} is the manifold's dimension.

For connected [[differentiable manifold]]s, the dimension is also the dimension of the [[Tangent space|tangent vector space]] at any point.

In [[geometric topology]], the theory of manifolds is characterized by the way dimensions 1 and 2 are relatively elementary, the '''high-dimensional''' cases {{nowrap|{{math|''n'' &gt; 4}}}} are simplified by having extra space in which to "work"; and the cases {{math|''n'' &amp;#61; 3}} and {{math|4}} are in some senses the most difficult. This state of affairs was highly marked in the various cases of the [[Poincaré conjecture]], where four different proof methods are applied.

====Complex dimension====

The dimension of a manifold depends on the base field with respect to which Euclidean space is defined.  While analysis usually assumes a manifold to be over the [[real numbers]], it is sometimes useful in the study of [[complex manifold]]s and [[dimension of an algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]] to work over the [[complex numbers]] instead. A complex number (''x'' + ''iy'') has a [[real part]] ''x'' and an [[imaginary part]] ''y'', where x and y are both real numbers; hence, the complex dimension is half the real dimension.  

Conversely, in algebraically unconstrained contexts, a single complex coordinate system may be applied to an object having two real dimensions.  For example, an ordinary two-dimensional [[sphere|spherical surface]], when given a complex metric, becomes a [[Riemann sphere]] of one complex dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Yau, S-T and Nadis, S.; ''The Shape of Inner Space'', Basic Books, 2010, Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Varieties===
{{main|Dimension of an algebraic variety}}
The dimension of an [[algebraic variety]] may be defined in various equivalent ways. The most intuitive way is probably the dimension of the [[tangent space]] at any [[Regular point of an algebraic variety]]. Another intuitive way is to define the dimension as the number of [[hyperplane]]s that are needed in order to have an intersection with the variety that is reduced to a finite number of points (dimension zero). This definition is based on the fact that the intersection of a variety with a hyperplane reduces the dimension by one unless if the hyperplane contains the variety.

An [[algebraic set]] being a finite union of algebraic varieties, its dimension is the maximum of the dimensions of its components. It is equal to the maximal length of the chains &lt;math&gt;V_0\subsetneq V_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq V_d&lt;/math&gt; of sub-varieties of the given algebraic set (the length of such a chain is the number of "&lt;math&gt;\subsetneq&lt;/math&gt;").

Each variety can be considered as an [[stack (mathematics)|algebraic stack]], and its dimension as variety agrees with its dimension as stack. There are however many stacks which do not correspond to varieties, and some of these have negative dimension. Specifically, if ''V'' is a variety of dimension ''m'' and ''G'' is an [[algebraic group]] of dimension ''n'' [[group action|acting on ''V'']], then the [[quotient stack]] [''V''/''G''] has dimension ''m''&amp;minus;''n''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fantechi|first=Barbara|chapter=Stacks for everybody|title=European Congress of Mathematics Volume I|volume=201|pages=349–359|series=Progr. Math.|publisher=Birkhäuser|year=2001|chapter-url=http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117052957/http://www.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de/~rehmann/ECM/cdrom/3ecm/pdfs/pant3/fantechi.pdf|archivedate=2006-01-17|df=}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Krull dimension===
The [[Krull dimension]] of a [[commutative ring]] is the maximal length of chains of [[prime ideal]]s in it, a chain of length ''n'' being a sequence &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}_0\subsetneq \mathcal{P}_1\subsetneq \ldots \subsetneq\mathcal{P}_n &lt;/math&gt; of prime ideals related by inclusion. It is strongly related to the dimension of an algebraic variety, because of the natural correspondence between sub-varieties and prime ideals of the ring of the polynomials on the variety.

For an [[algebra over a field]], the dimension as [[vector space]] is finite if and only if its Krull dimension is 0.

===Topological spaces===

For any [[normal topological space]] {{math|''X''}}, the [[Lebesgue covering dimension]] of {{math|''X''}} is defined to be ''n'' if ''n'' is the smallest [[integer]] for which the following holds: any [[open cover]] has an open refinement (a second open cover where each element is a subset of an element in the first cover) such that no point is included in more than {{math|''n'' + 1}} elements. In this case dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ''n''}}. For {{math|''X''}} a manifold, this coincides with the dimension mentioned above. If no such integer {{math|''n''}} exists, then the dimension of {{math|''X''}} is said to be infinite, and one writes dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} ∞}}. Moreover, {{math|''X''}} has dimension −1, i.e. dim {{math|''X'' {{=}} −1}} if and only if {{math|''X''}} is empty. This definition of covering dimension can be extended from the class of normal spaces to all [[Tychonoff space]]s merely by replacing the term "open" in the definition by the term "'''functionally open'''".

An [[inductive dimension]] may be defined [[Mathematical induction|inductively]] as follows. Consider a [[Isolated point|discrete set]] of points (such as a finite collection of points) to be 0-dimensional. By dragging a 0-dimensional object in some direction, one obtains a 1-dimensional object. By dragging a 1-dimensional object in a ''new direction'', one obtains a 2-dimensional object. In general one obtains an ({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional object by dragging an {{math|''n''}}-dimensional object in a ''new'' direction.  The inductive dimension of a topological space may refer to the ''small inductive dimension'' or the ''large inductive dimension'', and is based on the analogy that {{nowrap|({{math|''n'' + 1}})-dimensional}} balls have {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[boundary (topology)|boundaries]], permitting an inductive definition based on the dimension of the boundaries of open sets.

Similarly, for the class of [[CW complexes]], the dimension of an object is the largest {{mvar|n}} for which the [[n-skeleton|{{mvar|n}}-skeleton]] is nontrivial.  Intuitively, this can be described as follows: if the original space can be [[homotopy|continuously deformed]] into a collection of [[simplex|higher-dimensional triangles]] joined at their faces with a complicated surface, then the dimension of the object is the dimension of those triangles.{{cite needed|date=June 2018}}

===Hausdorff dimension===
The [[Hausdorff dimension]] is useful for studying structurally complicated sets, especially [[fractal]]s. The Hausdorff dimension is defined for all [[metric space]]s and, unlike the dimensions considered above, can also have non-integer real values.&lt;ref name="Hausdorff dimension"&gt;[http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html Fractal Dimension] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027003440/http://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/chaos-game/node6.html |date=2006-10-27 }}, Boston University Department of Mathematics and Statistics&lt;/ref&gt; The [[box-counting dimension|box dimension]] or [[Minkowski dimension]] is a variant of the same idea. In general, there exist more definitions of [[fractal dimension]]s that work for highly irregular sets and attain non-integer positive real values. Fractals have been found useful to describe many natural objects and phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title=Fractals and Disordered Systems |year=1991 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor2-first=Shlomo |editor2-last=Havlin |editor1-first=Armin |editor1-last=Bunde |editor2-link=Shlomo Havlin |title= Fractals in Science |year=1994 |publisher=Springer }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2015}}

===Hilbert spaces===
Every [[Hilbert space]] admits an [[orthonormal basis]], and any two such bases for a particular space have the same [[cardinality]]. This cardinality is called the dimension of the Hilbert space. This dimension is finite if and only if the space's [[Hamel dimension]] is finite, and in this case the two dimensions coincide.

== In physics ==

===Spatial dimensions===
Classical physics theories describe three [[physical dimension]]s: from a particular point in [[space]], the basic directions in which we can move are up/down, left/right, and forward/backward. Movement in any other direction can be expressed in terms of just these three. Moving down is the same as moving up a negative distance. Moving diagonally upward and forward is just as the name of the direction implies; ''i.e.'', moving in a [[linear combination]] of up and forward. In its simplest form: a line describes one dimension, a plane describes two dimensions, and a cube describes three dimensions. (See [[Space]] and [[Cartesian coordinate system]].)

===Time&lt;!--'Temporal dimension' and 'Temporal dimensions' redirect here--&gt;===
A '''temporal dimension'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is a dimension of time. Time is often referred to as the "[[Spacetime|fourth dimension]]" for this reason, but that is not to imply that it is a spatial dimension. A temporal dimension is one way to measure physical change. It is perceived differently from the three spatial dimensions in that there is only one of it, and that we cannot move freely in time but subjectively move [[Arrow of time|in one direction]].

The equations used in physics to model reality do not treat time in the same way that humans commonly perceive it. The equations of [[classical mechanics]] are [[T-symmetry|symmetric with respect to time]], and equations of quantum mechanics are typically symmetric if both time and other quantities (such as [[C-symmetry|charge]] and [[Parity (physics)|parity]]) are reversed. In these models, the perception of time flowing in one direction is an artifact of the [[laws of thermodynamics]] (we perceive time as flowing in the direction of increasing [[entropy]]).

The best-known treatment of time as a dimension is [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[special relativity]] (and extended to [[general relativity]]), which treats perceived space and time as components of a four-dimensional [[manifold]], known as [[spacetime]], and in the special, flat case as [[Minkowski space]].

===Additional dimensions===

In physics, three dimensions of space and one of time is the accepted norm. However, there are theories that attempt to unify the four [[fundamental forces]] by introducing [[extra dimensions]]. Most notably, [[superstring theory]] requires [[10 spacetime dimensions]], and originates from a more fundamental [[M-theory|11-dimensional]] theory tentatively called [[M-theory]] which subsumes five previously distinct superstring theories. To date, no experimental or observational evidence is available to support the existence of these extra dimensions. If extra dimensions exist, they must be hidden from us by some physical mechanism. One well-studied possibility is that the extra dimensions may be "curled up" at such tiny scales as to be effectively invisible to current experiments. Limits on the size and other properties of extra dimensions are set by particle experiments{{clarify|date=October 2014}} such as those at the [[Large Hadron Collider]].&lt;ref name="arxiv.org"&gt;CMS Collaboration, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 "Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810063016/https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375 |date=2017-08-10 }} (arxiv.org)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the level of [[quantum field theory]], [[Kaluza–Klein theory]] unifies [[gravity]] with [[Gauge theory|gauge]] interactions, based on the realization that gravity propagating in small, compact extra dimensions is equivalent to gauge interactions at long distances. In particular when the geometry of the extra dimensions is trivial, it reproduces [[electromagnetism]]. However at sufficiently high energies or short distances, this setup still suffers from the same pathologies that famously obstruct direct attempts to describe [[quantum gravity]]. Therefore, these models still require a [[UV completion]], of the kind that string theory is intended to provide. In particular, superstring theory requires six compact dimensions forming a [[Calabi–Yau manifold]]. Thus Kaluza-Klein theory may be considered either as an incomplete description on its own, or as a subset of string theory model building.
 
In addition to small and curled up extra dimensions, there may be extra dimensions that instead aren't apparent because the matter associated with our visible universe is localized on a {{nowrap|(3 + 1)-dimensional}} subspace. Thus the extra dimensions need not be small and compact but may be [[large extra dimensions]]. [[D-brane]]s are dynamical extended objects of various dimensionalities predicted by string theory that could play this role. They have the property that open string excitations, which are associated with gauge interactions, are confined to the [[brane]] by their endpoints, whereas the closed strings that mediate the gravitational interaction are free to propagate into the whole spacetime, or "the bulk". This could be related to why gravity is exponentially weaker than the other forces, as it effectively dilutes itself as it propagates into a higher-dimensional volume.

Some aspects of brane physics have been applied to [[Brane cosmology|cosmology]]. For example, brane gas cosmology&lt;ref&gt;Brandenberger, R., Vafa, C., [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1989NuPhB.316..391B Superstrings in the early universe]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Watson, [http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf Brane Gas Cosmology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027144123/http://www-astro-theory.fnal.gov/Conferences/cosmo02/poster/watson.pdf |date=2014-10-27 }} (pdf).&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According to this idea it would be because three is the largest number of spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.

Extra dimensions are said to be [[Universal extra dimension|universal]] if all fields are equally free to propagate within them.

== Networks and dimension ==

Some complex [[Network science|network]]s are characterized by [[fractal dimension]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song |first=Chaoming|  author2link=Shlomo Havlin  |title=Self-similarity of complex networks |journal=Nature |year=2005 |volume=433  |doi=10.1038/nature03248 |pmid=15674285|arxiv=cond-mat/0503078v1 |bibcode=2005Natur.433..392S |last2=Havlin |first2=Shlomo |last3=Makse |first3=Hernán A. |issue=7024|pages=392-395}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept of dimension can be generalized to include networks embedded in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Dimension of spatially embedded networks |journal=Nature Physics |year=2011 |bibcode=2011NatPh...7..481D|doi=10.1038/nphys1932 |last=Daqing |first=Li |last2=Kosmidis |first2=Kosmas |last3=Bunde |first3=Armin |last4=Havlin |first4=Shlomo |author4link=Shlomo Havlin|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=481 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dimension characterize their spatial constraints.

== In literature ==
{{main|Fourth dimension in literature}}

[[Science fiction]] texts often mention the concept of "dimension" when referring to [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel or alternate universe]]s or other imagined [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]]. This usage is derived from the idea that to travel to parallel/alternate universes/planes of existence one must travel in a direction/dimension besides the standard ones. In effect, the other universes/planes are just a small distance away from our own, but the distance is in a fourth (or higher) spatial (or non-spatial) dimension, not the standard ones.

One of the most heralded science fiction stories regarding true geometric dimensionality, and often recommended as a starting point for those just starting to investigate such matters, is the 1884 novella ''[[Flatland]]'' by Edwin A. Abbott. Isaac Asimov, in his foreword to the Signet Classics 1984 edition, described ''Flatland'' as "The best introduction one can find into the manner of perceiving dimensions."

The idea of other dimensions was incorporated into many early science fiction stories, appearing prominently, for example, in [[Miles J. Breuer]]'s ''The Appendix and the Spectacles'' (1928) and [[Murray Leinster]]'s ''The Fifth-Dimension Catapult'' (1931); and appeared irregularly in science fiction by the 1940s.  Classic stories involving other dimensions include [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[—And He Built a Crooked House]]'' (1941), in which a California architect designs a house based on a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract; and [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s ''Tiger by the Tail'' and ''The Universe Between'' (both 1951). Another reference is [[Madeleine L'Engle]]'s novel ''[[A Wrinkle In Time]]'' (1962), which uses the fifth dimension as a way for "tesseracting the universe" or "folding" space in order to move across it quickly. The fourth and fifth dimensions were also a key component of the book ''[[The Boy Who Reversed Himself]]'' by [[William Sleator]].

== In philosophy ==

[[Immanuel Kant]], in 1783, wrote: "That everywhere space (which is not itself the boundary of another space) has three dimensions and that space in general cannot have more dimensions is based on the proposition that not more than three lines can intersect at right angles in one point. This proposition cannot at all be shown from concepts, but rests immediately on intuition and indeed on pure intuition ''a priori'' because it is apodictically (demonstrably) certain."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics That Will Be Able to Present Itself as a Science|Prolegomena]]'', § 12&lt;/ref&gt;

"Space has Four Dimensions" is a short story published in 1846 by German philosopher and [[Experimental psychology|experimental psychologist]] [[Gustav Fechner]] under the [[pseudonym]] "Dr. Mises". The protagonist in the tale is a shadow who is aware of and able to communicate with other shadows, but who is trapped on a two-dimensional surface. According to Fechner, this "shadow-man" would conceive of the third dimension as being one of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Banchoff |first=Thomas F. |journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews |title=From Flatland to Hypergraphics: Interacting with Higher Dimensions |year=1990 |url=http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |doi=10.1179/030801890789797239 |volume=15 |issue=4 |page=364 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130414023125/http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/ISR/ISR.html |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story bears a strong similarity to the "[[Allegory of the Cave]]" presented in [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' ([[Circa|c.]] 380&amp;nbsp;BC).

[[File:Islm.svg|thumb|A diagram of the [[IS/LM model]]]]

In [[economics]], a '''model''' is a [[theory|theoretical]] construct representing economic [[wikt:process|processes]] by a set of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] and a set of [[logic]]al and/or quantitative relationships between them. The economic [[Conceptual model|model]] is a simplified, often [[Mathematical model|mathematical]], framework designed to illustrate complex processes. Frequently, economic models posit [[Coefficient of regression|structural parameters]].&lt;ref&gt;Moffatt, Mike. (2008) [[About.com]] ''[http://economics.about.com/od/economicsglossary/g/structuralp.htm Structural Parameters]'' Economics Glossary; Terms Beginning with S. Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A model may have various [[exogenous variable]]s, and those variables may change to create various responses by economic variables. Methodological uses of models include investigation, theorizing, and fitting theories to the world.&lt;ref&gt; [[Mary S. Morgan]], 2008 "models," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_M000391 Abstract].&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  Vivian Walsh 1987. "models and theory," ''The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics'', v. 3, pp. 482–83.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==

In general terms, economic models have two functions: first as a simplification of and abstraction from observed data, and second as a means of selection of data based on a [[paradigm]] of [[econometric]] study.

''Simplification'' is particularly important for economics given the enormous [[complexity]] of economic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Friedman |first=M. |authorlink=Milton Friedman |chapter=The Methodology of Positive Economics |title=Essays in Positive Economics |location=Chicago |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complexity can be attributed to the diversity of factors that determine economic activity; these factors include: individual  and [[co-operation|cooperative]] decision processes, [[Natural resource|resource]] limitations, [[natural environment|environment]]al and [[geography|geographical]] constraints, [[institution]]al and [[law|legal]] requirements and purely [[random]] fluctuations.  Economists therefore must make a reasoned choice of which variables and which relationships between these variables are relevant and which ways of analyzing and presenting this information are useful.

''Selection'' is important because the nature of an economic model will often determine what facts will be looked at, and how they will be compiled. For example, [[inflation]] is a general economic concept, but to measure inflation requires a model of behavior, so that an economist can differentiate between changes in relative prices and changes in price that are to be attributed to inflation.

In addition to their professional [[academia|academic]] interest, the use of models include:
* [[Forecasting]] economic activity in a  way in which conclusions are logically related to assumptions;
* Proposing [[economic policy]] to modify future economic activity;
* Presenting reasoned arguments to politically justify economic policy at the national level, to explain and influence [[corporation|company]] strategy at the level of the firm,  or to provide intelligent advice for household economic decisions at the level of households.
* [[Plan]]ning and [[allocation of resources|allocation]], in the case of centrally [[planned economy|planned]] economies, and on a smaller scale in [[logistics]] and [[management]] of [[business]]es.
* In [[finance]] predictive models have been used since the 1980s for [[Trade|trading]] ([[investment]], and [[speculation]]), for example emerging market [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] were often traded based on economic models predicting the growth of the [[developing nation]] issuing them. Since the 1990s many long-term [[risk management]] models have incorporated economic relationships between simulated variables in an attempt to detect high-exposure future scenarios (often through a [[Monte Carlo method]]).

A model establishes an ''[[logical argument|argumentative framework]]'' for applying logic and [[mathematics]] that can be independently discussed and tested and that can be applied in various instances. Policies and arguments that rely on economic models have a clear basis for soundness, namely the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the supporting model.

Economic models in current use do not pretend to be ''theories of everything economic''; any such pretensions would immediately be thwarted by [[computation]]al infeasibility and the incompleteness or lack of theories for various types of economic behavior.  Therefore, conclusions drawn from models will be approximate representations of economic facts.  However, properly constructed models can remove extraneous information and isolate useful [[approximation]]s of key relationships.  In this way more can be understood about the relationships in question than by trying to understand the entire economic process.

The details of model construction vary with type of model and its application, but a generic process can be identified. Generally any modelling process has two steps: generating a model, then checking the model for accuracy (sometimes called diagnostics). The diagnostic step is important because a model is only useful to the extent that it accurately mirrors the relationships that it purports to describe. Creating and diagnosing a model is frequently an iterative process in which the model is modified (and hopefully improved) with each iteration of diagnosis and respecification. Once a satisfactory model is found, it should be double checked by applying it to a different data set.

== Types of models ==

According to whether all the model variables are deterministic, economic models can be classified as [[stochastic process|stochastic]] or non-stochastic models; according to whether all the variables are quantitative, economic models are classified as discrete or continuous choice model; according to the model's intended purpose/function, it can be classified as
quantitative or qualitative; according to the model's ambit, it can be classified as a general equilibrium model, a partial equilibrium model, or even a non-equilibrium model; according to the economic agent's characteristics, models can be classified as rational agent models, representative agent models etc.

*'''Stochastic models''' are formulated using [[stochastic process]]es. They model economically observable values over time. Most of [[econometrics]] is based on [[statistics]] to formulate and test [[hypotheses]] about these processes or estimate parameters for them. A widely used bargaining class of simple econometric models popularized by [[Jan Tinbergen|Tinbergen]] and later [[Herman Wold|Wold]] are [[autoregressive]] models, in which the stochastic process satisfies some relation between current and past values. Examples of these are [[autoregressive moving average model]]s and related ones such as [[autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity]] (ARCH) and [[GARCH]] models for the modelling of [[heteroskedasticity]].
*'''Non-stochastic models''' may be purely qualitative (for example, relating to [[social choice theory]]) or quantitative (involving rationalization of financial variables, for example with [[hyperbolic coordinates]], and/or specific forms of [[Function (mathematics)|functional relationships]] between variables).  In some cases economic predictions in a coincidence of a model merely assert the direction of movement of economic variables, and so the functional relationships are used only stoical in a qualitative sense: for example, if the [[price]] of an item increases, then the [[Demand (economics)|demand]] for that item will decrease.  For such models, economists often use two-dimensional graphs instead of functions.
*'''Qualitative models''' – although almost all economic models involve some form of mathematical or quantitative analysis, qualitative models are occasionally used. One example is qualitative [[scenario planning]] in which possible future events are played out. Another example is non-numerical decision tree analysis. Qualitative models often suffer from lack of precision.

At a more practical level, quantitative modelling is applied to many areas of economics and several methodologies have evolved more or less independently of each other. As a result, no overall model [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is naturally available.  We can nonetheless provide a few examples that illustrate some particularly relevant points of model construction.
*An [[accounting]] model is one based on the premise that for every [[credit (finance)|credit]] there is a [[debit]]. More symbolically, an accounting model expresses some principle of conservation in the form
:: algebraic sum of inflows = sinks − sources

:This principle is certainly true for [[money]] and it is the basis for [[national income]] accounting.  Accounting models are true by [[Convention (norm)|convention]], that is any [[experiment]]al failure to confirm them,  would be attributed to [[fraud]], arithmetic error or an extraneous  injection (or destruction) of cash, which we would interpret as showing the experiment was conducted improperly.

*Optimality and constrained optimization models – Other examples of quantitative models are based on principles such as [[Profit (economics)|profit]] or [[utility]] [[utility maximization|maximization]].  An example of such a model is given by the [[comparative statics]] of [[tax]]ation on the profit-maximizing firm. The profit of a firm is given by

::&lt;math&gt; \pi(x,t) = x p(x) - C(x) - t x \quad&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;p(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the price that a product commands in the market if it is supplied at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;xp(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the revenue obtained from selling the product, &lt;math&gt;C(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the cost of bringing the product to [[Market (economics)|market]] at the rate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the tax that the firm must pay per unit of the product sold.

:The [[profit maximization]] assumption states that a firm will produce at the output rate ''x'' if that rate maximizes the firm's profit. Using [[differential calculus]] we can obtain conditions on ''x'' under which this holds. The first order maximization condition for ''x'' is

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial  \pi(x,t)}{\partial x} =\frac{\partial  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial x} -t= 0 &lt;/math&gt;

:Regarding ''x'' as an implicitly defined function of ''t'' by this equation (see  [[implicit function theorem]]), one concludes that the [[derivative]] of ''x'' with respect to ''t'' has the same sign as

::&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial^2  (x p(x) - C(x))}{\partial^2 x}={\partial^2\pi(x,t)\over \partial x^2},&lt;/math&gt;

:which is negative if the [[Second derivative test|second order condition]]s for a [[local maximum]] are satisfied.

:Thus the profit maximization model predicts something about the effect of taxation on output, namely that output decreases with increased taxation. If the predictions of the model fail, we conclude that the profit maximization hypothesis was false; this should lead to alternate theories of the firm, for example based on [[bounded rationality]].

:Borrowing a notion apparently first used in economics by [[Paul Samuelson]], this model of taxation and the predicted dependency of output on the tax rate, illustrates an ''operationally meaningful theorem''; that is one requiring some economically meaningful assumption that is [[falsifiability|falsifiable]] under certain conditions.

* Aggregate models. [[Macroeconomics]] needs to deal with aggregate quantities such as [[Output (economics)|output]], the [[price level]], the [[interest rate]] and so on. Now real output is actually a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] of [[good (accounting)|goods]] and [[Service (economics)|service]]s, such as cars, passenger airplanes, [[computer]]s, food items, secretarial services, home repair services etc. Similarly [[price]] is the vector of individual prices of goods and services. Models in which the vector nature of the quantities is maintained are used in practice, for example [[Wassily Leontief|Leontief]] [[input-output model]]s are of this kind.  However, for the most part, these models are computationally much harder to deal with and harder to use as tools for [[qualitative research|qualitative analysis]]. For this reason, [[macroeconomic model]]s usually lump together different variables into a single quantity such as ''output'' or ''price''. Moreover, quantitative relationships between these aggregate variables are often parts of important macroeconomic theories.  This process of aggregation and functional dependency between various aggregates usually is interpreted statistically and validated by [[econometrics]]. For instance, one ingredient of the [[Keynesian economics|Keynesian model]] is a functional relationship between consumption and national income: C = C(''Y'').  This relationship plays an important role in Keynesian analysis.

== Problems with economic models ==

Most economic models rest on a number of assumptions that are not entirely realistic.  For example, agents are often assumed to have perfect information, and markets are often assumed to clear without friction.  Or, the model may omit issues that are important to the question being considered, such as [[Externality|externalities]]. Any analysis of the results of an economic model must therefore consider the extent to which these results may be compromised by inaccuracies in these assumptions, and a large literature has grown up discussing [[problems with economic models]], or at least asserting that their results are unreliable.

== History ==

One of the major problems addressed by economic models has been understanding economic growth.  An early attempt to provide a technique to approach this came from the French [[physiocrat]]ic school in the Eighteenth century.  Among these economists, [[François Quesnay]] should be noted, particularly for his development and use of tables he called ''[[Tableau économique|Tableaux économiques]]''.  These tables have in fact been interpreted in more modern terminology as a Leontiev model, see the Phillips reference below.

All through the 18th century (that is, well before the founding of modern political economy, conventionally marked by Adam Smith's 1776 [[Wealth of Nations]]) simple probabilistic models were used to understand the economics of [[insurance]]. This was a natural extrapolation of the theory of [[gambling]], and played an important role both in the development of [[probability theory]] itself and in the development of [[actuarial science]]. Many of the giants of 18th century [[mathematics]] contributed to this field. Around 1730, [[De Moivre]] addressed some of these problems in the 3rd edition of ''[[The Doctrine of Chances]]''. Even earlier (1709), [[Nicolas Bernoulli]] studies problems related to savings and interest in the [[Ars Conjectandi]]. In 1730, [[Daniel Bernoulli]] studied "moral probability" in his book [[Mensura Sortis]], where he introduced what would today be called "logarithmic utility of money" and applied it to gambling and insurance problems, including a solution of the paradoxical [[St. Petersburg paradox|Saint Petersburg problem]]. All of these developments were summarized by [[Laplace]] in his [[Analytical Theory of Probabilities]] (1812). Clearly, by the time [[David Ricardo]] came along he had a lot of well-established math to draw from.

== Tests of macroeconomic predictions ==
In the late 1980s the [[Brookings Institution]] compared 12 leading [[macroeconomic models]] available at the time. They compared the models' predictions for how the economy would respond to specific economic shocks (allowing the models to control for all the variability in the real world; this was a test of model vs. model, not a test against the actual outcome). Although the models simplified the world and started from a stable, known common parameters the various models gave significantly different answers. For instance, in calculating the impact of a [[monetary]] loosening on output some models estimated a 3% change in [[GDP]] after one year, and one gave almost no change, with the rest spread between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frankel|first=Jeffrey A.|title=The Sources of Disagreement Among International Macro Models and Implications for Policy Coordination|work=NBER Working Paper No. 1925 |date=May 1986 |doi=10.3386/w1925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partly as a result of such experiments, modern central bankers no longer have as much confidence that it is possible to 'fine-tune' the economy as they had in the 1960s and early 1970s. Modern policy makers tend to use a less activist approach, explicitly because they lack confidence that their models will actually predict where the economy is going, or the effect of any shock upon it. The new, more humble, approach sees danger in dramatic policy changes based on model predictions, because of several practical and theoretical limitations in current macroeconomic models; in addition to the theoretical pitfalls, ([[Model (economics)#Pitfalls|listed above]]) some problems specific to aggregate modelling are:
* Limitations in model construction caused by difficulties in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the real economy. (Hence the profusion of separate models.)
* The law of [[unintended consequence]]s, on elements of the real economy not yet included in the model.
* The [[Lag operator|time lag]] in both receiving data and the reaction of economic variables to policy makers attempts to 'steer' them (mostly through [[monetary]] policy) in the direction that central bankers want them to move. [[Milton Friedman]] has vigorously argued that these lags are so long and unpredictably variable that effective management of the macroeconomy is impossible.
* The difficulty in correctly specifying all of the parameters (through [[econometric]] measurements) even if the structural model and data were perfect.
* The fact that all the model's relationships and coefficients are stochastic, so that the error term becomes very large quickly, and the available snapshot of the input parameters is already out of date.
* Modern economic models incorporate the reaction of the public and market to the policy maker's actions (through [[game theory]]), and this feedback is included in modern models (following the [[rational expectations]] revolution and [[Robert Lucas, Jr.]]'s [[Lucas critique]] of non-[[microfounded]]) models. If the response to the decision maker's actions (and their [[time inconsistency|credibility]]) must be included in the model then it becomes much harder to influence some of the variables simulated.

=== Comparison with models in other sciences ===

[[Complex systems]] specialist and mathematician [[David Orrell]] wrote on this issue in his book [[Apollo's Arrow]] and explained that the weather, human health and economics use similar methods of prediction (mathematical models). Their systems—the atmosphere, the human body and the economy—also have similar levels of complexity. He found that forecasts fail because the models suffer from two problems : (i) they cannot capture the full detail of the underlying system, so rely on approximate equations; (ii) they are sensitive to small changes in the exact form of these equations. This is because complex systems like the economy or the climate consist of a delicate balance of opposing forces, so a slight imbalance in their representation has big effects. Thus, predictions of things like economic recessions are still highly inaccurate, despite the use of enormous models running on fast computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postpythagorean.com/FAQ.html|title=FAQ for Apollo's Arrow Future of Everything|author=|date=|website=www.postpythagorean.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of deterministic chaos on economic models ===

Economic and meteorological simulations may share a fundamental limit to their predictive powers: [[Chaos theory|chaos]]. Although the modern mathematical work on [[chaotic systems]] began in the 1970s the danger of chaos had been identified and defined in ''[[Econometrica]]'' as early as 1958:
:"Good theorising consists to a large extent in avoiding assumptions....(with the property that)....a small change in what is posited will seriously affect the conclusions."
:([[William Baumol]], Econometrica, 26 ''see'': [http://www.iemss.org/iemss2004/pdf/keynotes/Keynote_OXLEY.pdf ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'']).

It is straightforward to design economic models susceptible to [[butterfly effect]]s of initial-condition sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Wilmott]] on his early research in finance: "I quickly dropped... chaos theory (as) it was too easy to construct ‘toy models’ that looked plausible but were useless in practice." {{citation|first=Paul|last=Wilmott|title=Frequently Asked Questions in Quantitative Finance| publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n4swgjSoMyIC&amp;pg=PT227 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~ages/files/NL_Chaos_and_%20Macro%20-%20429%20Essay.pdf|format=PDF|first=Steve|last=Kuchta|title=Nonlinearity and Chaos in Macroeconomics and Financial Markets|publisher=[[University of Connecticut]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the [[econometric]] research program to identify which variables are chaotic (if any) has largely concluded that aggregate macroeconomic variables probably do not behave chaotically. This would mean that refinements to the models could ultimately produce reliable long-term forecasts. However the validity of this conclusion has generated two challenges:
* In 2004 [[Philip Mirowski]] challenged this view and those who hold it, saying that chaos in economics is suffering from a biased "crusade" against it by [[neo-classical economics]] in order to preserve their mathematical models.
* The variables in [[finance]] may well be subject to chaos. Also in 2004, the [[University of Canterbury]] study ''Economics on the Edge of Chaos'' concludes that after noise is removed from [[S&amp;P 500]] returns, evidence of [[determinism|deterministic]] chaos ''is'' found.

More recently, chaos (or the butterfly effect) has been identified as less significant than previously thought to explain prediction errors. Rather, the predictive power of economics and meteorology would mostly be limited by the models themselves and the nature of their underlying systems (see [[Economic models#Comparison with models in other sciences|Comparison with models in other sciences]] above).

=== Critique of hubris in planning ===

A key strand of [[free market]] economic thinking is that the market's [[invisible hand]] guides an economy to prosperity more efficiently than [[command economy|central planning]] using an economic model. One reason, emphasized by [[Friedrich Hayek]], is the claim that many of the true forces shaping the economy can never be captured in a single plan. This is an argument that cannot be made through a conventional (mathematical) economic model, because it says that there are critical systemic-elements that will always be omitted from any top-down analysis of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The '''European social model''' is a common vision many European states have for a society that combines economic growth with high [[living standard]]s and good [[working conditions]]. Historian [[Tony Judt]] has argued that the European social model "binds Europe together" in contrast to the '[[American way of life]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/17/politics1|title=The Guardian|last=Laity|first=Paul|date=17 May 2008|work=Uncomfortable truths. Interview with Tony Judt.|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European states do not all use a single [[social model]], but [[welfare state]]s in Europe do share several broad characteristics. These generally include a commitment to [[full employment]], [[social protection]]s for all citizens, [[social inclusion]], and democracy. Examples common among European countries include [[universal health care]], free higher education, strong labor protections and regulations, and generous welfare programs in areas such as unemployment insurance, retirement pensions, and public housing. The [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of the European Community]] set out several social objectives: "promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions ... proper social protection, dialogue between management and labour, the development of human resources with a view to lasting high employment and the combating of exclusion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|title=The European Social Model|date=21 March 2007|publisher=European Trade Union Confederation|accessdate=4 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109165943/http://www.etuc.org/a/2771|archive-date=9 November 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because different European states focus on different aspects of the model, it has been argued that there are four distinct social models in Europe: the Nordic, British, Mediterranean and the Continental.&lt;ref&gt;Sapir, André. 2005.

New York: Oxford University Press (USA).&lt;/ref&gt;

The general outlines of a European social model emerged during the [[Post-World War II economic expansion|post-war boom]]. [[Tony Judt]] lists a number of causes: the abandonment of [[protectionism]], the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]], cheap energy, and a desire to catch up with [[living standards]] enjoyed in the United States. The European social model also enjoyed a low degree of external competition as the Soviet bloc, China and India were not yet integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=12767280&amp;source=login_payBarrier|title=The Economist|last=Charlemagne|date=11 December 2008|work=The left's resignation note|accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, it has become common to question whether the European social model is sustainable in the face of low birthrates, [[globalisation]], [[Europeanisation]] and an [[Ageing of Europe|ageing population]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/933|title=Europe's Ailing Social Model: Facts &amp; Fairy-Tales|author=Martin De Vlieghere|author2=Paul Vreymans|last-author-amp=yes|date=23 March 2006|work=The Brussels Journal|accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bof.fi/en/suomen_pankki/ajankohtaista/puheet/2007/EL_puhe27112007.htm|title=Remarks by Governor Liikanen: "A European Social Model: an Asset or a Liability?"|date=27 November 2007|publisher=The World Political Forum|accessdate=3 January 2010|location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Welfare state in Europe==

Some of the European welfare states have been described as the most well developed and extensive.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/cre/publish/pdfs/wp61a.pdf article]&lt;/ref&gt; A unique "European social model" is described in contrast with the social model existing in the US.

===Nordic model===
{{see also|Nordic model}}
As can be seen in the graph to the right, the Nordic model holds the highest level of [[social insurance]]. Its main characteristic is its universal provision nature which is based on the principle of "citizenship". Therefore, there exists a more generalised access, with lower conditionability, to the social provisions.

As regards labour market, these countries are characterised by important expenditures in [[active labour market policies]] whose aim is a rapid reinsertion of the [[unemployment|unemployed]] into the labour market. These countries are also characterised by a high share of [[public employment]]. Trade unions have a high membership and an important decision-making power which induces a low wage dispersion or more equitable income distribution.

The Nordic model is also characterised by a high [[tax wedge]].

===Continental model===
{{see also|Rhine capitalism}}
The Continental model has some similarities with the Nordic model. Nevertheless, it has a higher share of its expenditures devoted to pensions. The model is based on the principle of "security" and a system of subsidies which are not conditioned to employability (for example in the case of France or Belgium, there exist subsidies whose only requirement is being older than 25).

As regards the labour market, active policies are less important than in the Nordic model and in spite of a low membership rate, trade-unions have important decision-making powers in [[collective agreement]]s.

Another important aspect of the Continental model is the [[disability pension]]s.

===Anglo-Saxon model===
{{main|Anglo-Saxon economy}}
The Anglo-Saxon model features a lower level of expenditures than the previous ones. Its main particularity is its [[social assistance]] of last resort. Subsidies are directed to a higher extent to the working-age population and to a lower extent to pensions. Access to subsidies is (more) conditioned to employability (for instance, they are conditioned on having worked previously).

Active labour market policies are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller decision-making powers than in the previous models, this is one of the reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.

===Mediterranean model===&lt;!-- "Mediterranean model" redirects here --&gt;
The '''Mediterranean model'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; corresponds to southern European countries who developed their [[welfare state]] later than the previous ones (during the 1970s and 1980s). It is the model with the lowest share of expenditures and is strongly based on pensions and a low level of social assistance. There exists in these countries a higher segmentation of rights and status of persons receiving subsidies which has as one of its consequences a strongly conditioned access to social provisions.

The main characteristic of labour market policies is a rigid [[employment protection legislation]] and a frequent resort to [[early retirement]] policies as a means to improve employment conditions. Trade unions tend to have an important membership which again is one of the explanations behind a lower income dispersion than in the Anglo-Saxon model.

==Evaluating the different social models==
[[Image:Reducción en la pobreza de los Modelos Sociales Europeos.png|thumb|350px|Reduction in poverty by the different European social models. Reduction in [[Gini index]] after transfers and taxes (in percentage change).]]
[[Image:Eficiencia Gastos Sociales.jpg|thumb|350px|Efficiency of social expenditures in the four European social models]]

To evaluate the different social models, we follow the criteria used in Boeri (2002) and Sapir (2005) which consider that a social model should satisfy the following:
# Reduction in poverty. 
# Protection against labour market risks. 
# Rewards for labour participation.

===Reduction in poverty===
The graph on the right shows the reduction in inequality (as measured by the [[Gini index]]) after taking account of taxes and transfers, that is, to which extent does each social model reduce poverty without taking into account the reduction in poverty provoqued by taxes and transfers. The level of social expenditures is an indicator of the capacity of each model to reduce poverty: a bigger share of expenditures is in general associated to a higher reduction in poverty. Nevertheless, another aspect that should be taken into account is the efficiency in this poverty reduction. By this is meant that with a lower share of expenditures a higher reduction in poverty may be obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Sergiusz| last = Prokurat|title =European Social Model and East Asian Economic Model – different approach to productivity and competition in economy|publisher= Asia – Europe. Partnership or Rivalry?”|date= 2010|accessdate=4 August 2016|location= Wrocław|pages= 35–47|url= http://www.proeconomics.pl/artykuly/ESMandEAEM.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case, the graph on the right shows that the Anglosaxon and Nordic models are more efficient than the Continental or Mediterranean ones. The Continental model appears to be the least efficient. Given its high level of social expenditures, one would expect a higher poverty reduction than that attained by this model. Remark how the Anglosaxon model is found above the average line drawn whereas the Continental is found below that line.

===Protection against labour market risks===
[[Image:Relación entre protección al empleo y % trabajadores con beneficios desempleo.jpg|thumb|350px|As can be seen, there exists a negative relationship between [[employment protection legislation]] and the share of workers receiving [[unemployment benefits]].]]

Protection against labour market risks is generally assured by two means: 
# Regulation of the labour market by means of employment protection legislation which basically increases firing costs and [[severance payments]] for the employers. This is generally referred to as providing "employment" protection.
# [[Unemployment benefit]]s which are commonly financed with taxes or [[mandatory public insurance]]s to the employees and employers. This is generally referred to as providing protection to the "worker" as opposed to "employment".

As can be seen in the graph, there is a clear trade-off between these two types of labour market instruments (remark the clear negative slope between both). Once again different European countries have chosen a different position in their use of these two mechanisms of labour market protection. These differences can be summarised as follows: 
* The Mediterranean countries have chosen a higher "employment" protection while a very low share of their unemployed workers receives unemployment benefits. 
* The Nordic countries have chosen to protect to a lesser extent "employment" and instead, an important share of their unemployed workers receives benefits. 
* The continental countries have a higher level of both mechanisms than the European average, although by a small margin. 
* The Anglo-Saxon countries base their protection on unemployment benefits and a low level of employment protection.

Evaluating the different choices is a hard task. In general there exists consensus among economists on the fact that employment protection generates inefficiencies inside firms. Instead, there is no such consensus as regards the question of whether employment protection generates a higher level of unemployment.

===Rewards for labour participation===
[[Image:Ratio Empleo-Población.jpg|thumb|350px|[[Employment rate|Employment]] and [[Unemployment rate|unemployment]] rates for each social model]]
Sapir (2005) and Boeri (2002) propose looking at the [[employment-to-population ratio]] as the best way to analyse the incentives and rewards for employment in each social model. The [[Lisbon Strategy]] initiated in 2001 established that the members of the EU should attain a 70% employment rate by 2010.

In this case, the graph shows that the countries in the Nordic and Anglosaxon model are the ones with the highest employment rate whereas the Continental and Mediterranean countries have not attained the Lisbon Strategy target.

===Conclusion===
[[Image:Tipologia de los distintos modelos sociales europeos.png|thumb|400px|Classifying the different social models according to their [[Economic efficiency|efficiency]] and [[Equity (economics)|equity]]. Elevada means high whereas Baja means low.]]
Sapir (2005) proposes as a general mean to evaluate the different social models, the following two criteria: 
# [[Economic efficiency|Efficiency]], that is, whether the model provides the incentives so as to achieve the largest number possible of employed persons, that is, the highest [[employment rate]]. 
# Equity, that is, whether the social model achieves a relatively low poverty risk.

As can be seen in the graph, according to these two criteria, the best performance is achieved by the Nordic model. The Continental model should improve its efficiency whereas the Anglosaxon model its equity. The Mediterranean model under-performs in both criteria.

Some economists consider that between the Continental model and the Anglo-Saxon, the latter should be preferred given its better results in employment, which make it more sustainable in the long term, whereas the equity level depends on the preferences of each country (Sapir, 2005). Other economists argue that the Continental model cannot be considered worse than the Anglosaxon given that it is also the result of the preferences of those countries that support it (Fitoussi et al., 2000; Blanchard, 2004). This last argument can be used to justify any policy.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evolutionary epistemology''' refers to three distinct topics: (1) the biological evolution of [[cognition|cognitive]] mechanisms in animals and humans, (2) a theory that knowledge itself evolves by [[natural selection]], and (3) the study of the historical discovery of new abstract entities such as abstract number or abstract value that necessarily precede the individual acquisition and usage of such abstractions.

== Cognition in biological evolution ==

"Evolutionary epistemology" can refer to a branch of [[epistemology]] that applies the concepts of biological [[evolution]] to the growth of animal and human cognition.  It argues that the mind is in part genetically determined and that its structure and function reflect [[adaptation]], a [[Teleology in biology|nonteleological]] process of interaction between the organism and its environment. A cognitive trait tending to increase [[inclusive fitness]] in a given population should therefore grow more common over time, and a trait tending to prevent its carriers from passing on their genes should show up less and less frequently.

== Growth of knowledge ==

"Evolutionary epistemology" can also refer to a theory that applies the concepts of biological evolution to the growth of human knowledge, and argues that units of knowledge themselves, particularly scientific [[theories]], evolve according to selection.  In this case, a theory—like the [[germ theory]] of disease—becomes more or less credible according to changes in the body of knowledge surrounding it.

One of the hallmarks of evolutionary epistemology is the notion that empirical testing alone does not justify the pragmatic value of scientific theories, but rather that social and methodological processes select those theories with the closest "fit" to a given problem. The mere fact that a theory has survived the most rigorous empirical tests available does not, in the calculus of probability, predict its ability to survive future testing. [[Karl Popper]] used [[Newtonian physics]] as an example of a body of theories so thoroughly confirmed by testing as to be considered unassailable, but which were nevertheless overturned by [[General relativity|Einstein's insights]] into the nature of [[space-time]]. For the evolutionary epistemologist, all theories are true only provisionally, regardless of the degree of empirical testing they have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Popper, 1972. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process of discovering new abstract entities ==

"Evolutionary epistemology" can also refer to the opposite of (onto)genetic epistemology, namely phylogenetic epistemology as the historical discovery and reification of abstractions that necessarily precedes the learning of such abstractions by individuals. Piaget dismissed this possibility, stating

::"The fundamental hypothesis of genetic epistemology is that there is a parallelism between the progress made in the logical and rational organization of knowledge and the corresponding formative psychological processes.  Well, now, if that is our hypothesis, what will be our field of study?  Of course the most fruitful, most obvious field of study would be reconstituting human history: the history of human thinking in prehistoric man. Unfortunately, we are not very well informed about the psychology of [[Neanderthal man]] or about the psychology of Homo siniensis of [[Teilhard de Chardin]].  Since this field of biogenesis is not available to us, we shall do as biologists do and turn to ontogenesis.  Nothing could be more accessible to study than the ontogenesis of these notions. There are children all around us." &lt;ref name=Piaget&gt;Piaget, 1974. {{page needed|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget was mistaken in so quickly dismissing the study of phylogenetic epistemology, as there is much historical data available about the origins and evolution of the various notational systems that reify different kinds of abstract entity.

Popper is considered by many to have given evolutionary epistemology its first comprehensive treatment, though [[Donald T. Campbell]] coined the phrase in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Schilpp, 1974. pp. 412–463&lt;/ref&gt; and Piaget alluded to it in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, 1974, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and described the concept as one of five possible theories in ''The Origins of Intelligence in Children'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.pitt.edu/~strauss/origins_r.pdf p. 14ff]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Gilbert model''' was developed by [[Dennis Gilbert (sociologist)|Dennis Gilbert]] as a means of a more effective way of classifying people in a given [[society]] into [[social class]]es.

==Influences==
[[Karl Marx]] believed that social class is determined by ownership (or non-ownership) of the "means of economic production" - ownership of raw materials, farm land, coal mines, factories, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch06.htm
 |title=Das Kapital
 |author=Karl Marx
 |year=1867
 |accessdate=2009-10-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His theory contains the idea of a struggle between two social classes - the [[Bourgeoisie]] (the capital owners) and the [[Proletariat]] (the non-owner workers).

Like Marx, [[Max Weber]] agreed that social class is determined mostly on the basis of unequal distribution of economic power and hence the unequal distribution of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=63sC9uaYqQsC&amp;pg=PA85
 |title=Max Weber
 |author=Reinhard Bendix

 |pages=85–87
 |accessdate=2009-10-23
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also saw that honor, status and social prestige were key factors in determining what social class people belong to.  "Life-styles" such as where a person lives and the schools they attend are very important in determining social class. "Life-chances" also determined social class.  If a person becomes a respectable member of society it will raise their social class.  Party affiliations can also influence social class.

==Basis==
Even though Marx's and Weber's research were both taken into consideration when trying to create an effective means of [[social stratification]], they were not weighted the same. Although the Gilbert model is based on the assumption that [[class structure]] develops out of the [[economic system]] like the [[Marxist theory]], it is still has much more in common with Weber's more modern theory that dealt with [[socialism]].  The aspect that Marxism takes into consideration when referring to the economy is "what a specific person owns determines their class" - a [[capitalistic]] viewpoint. If a man owns a factory, he is going to be in a higher [[social class]] than someone who works in the factory.  In Marxist theory, the [[middle class]] is not emphasized or described, but it is clearly present in the Gilbert model.  The Gilbert model focuses on occupation and, more generally on the source of income (occupation for most, but also assets, and government transfers for people at the top or bottom) and when referring to how the [[economic system]] places people in classes.  The occupation of a person is directly related to a person's educational preparation because better education provides for a better occupation which in turn raises their class level.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six social classes==
The six [[social classes]] that provide the basis for the Gilbert model are determined based on the assumption of how [[class structure]] develops out of the economic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Capitalist class===
''(Typical income: $1.5 million , mostly from assets)''
Even though the capitalist class is a very small class of super rich capitalists at the top of the hierarchy, its impact on economy and society is far beyond their numbers.  These people contribute their money to political parties and are often owners of newspapers or television stations.  They have investments that affect millions of people in the [[labor force]].  They tend to only associate with other people from their own class, rarely interacting with people from an inferior class.  Even their children are usually [[Residential segregation|segregated]] attending only the most elite preparatory schools and universities.

===Upper middle class===
''(typical income $200,000; for Working rich $500,000)''
The [[upper middle class]] is the group in society most shaped by formal [[education]].  A college degree is usually required and graduate studies are becoming increasingly required.  Most people in this class are technicians, professionals, managers, officials, and highly successfully small business owners. At the top of this class is the growing segment of working rich, affluent professionals and business owners. Children in high school strive to prepare themselves for upper middle class jobs because these type of jobs are symbols of success.  Upper-middle-class people are able to purchase status symbols such as spacious homes.  They are convinced that they deserve what they have achieved and are mostly satisfied that they have achieved a proper share of the [[American Dream|American dream]].

===Lower middle class===
''(Typical income $85,000)''
To attain a middle class job it takes at least a high school diploma.  However, many in the middle class have received some form of additional post secondary training.  The most educated will become semi-professionals, or have low-level managerial jobs.  Sales and craft people are also included in this [[social class]].   It is estimated that really about a third of the population is middle class.

===Working class===
''(Typical income $40,000)''
The core of this [[working class]] is made up of semi-skilled machine operators.  Clerks and salespeople whose tasks are habitual and mechanized and require practically no skill beyond literacy.  Brief on the job training can also be considered to be a part of this class.  It is estimated that this class includes roughly a third of the population.

===Working-poor class===
''(Typical Income: $25,000)''
The [[working poor]] class includes unskilled laborers, people in service jobs and some of the lower-paid factory workers.    Income depends on the number of workers in the family and the amount of weeks that they work. Many have not finished high school.  Unable to save money and when retired the working poor depend heavily on their [[social security]] pensions to live.

===Underclass===
''(Typcial Income $15,000)''
These people are under-employed. They suffer from low education, low [[employability]], and/or low income.  Some can not work because of their age or  disability.  Hard times might be magnified because they belong to a [[minority group]] who suffers [[discrimination]] in the work force

Although the [[social hierarchy]] is most obvious at the extremes,  Differences between classes begin to become blurred when moving away from one of the extremes and towards the center to where the middle and working classes are.  It is difficult to get a precise classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24522">Images and  other stimuli contain both local features (details, parts) and global features (the whole). Precedence refers to the level of processing (global or local) to which attention is first directed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://autismlab.psyc.sfu.ca/sites/default/files/documents/Dana%20A.%20Hayward%202012.pdf | title=Flexible visual processing in young adults with autism: the effects of implicit learning on a global-local task. |vauthors=Hayward DA, Shore DI, Ristic J, Kovshoff H, Iarocci G, Mottron L, Burack JA | journal=J Autism Dev Disord |date=November 2012 | volume=42 | issue=11 | pages=2383–2392 | doi=10.1007/s10803-012-1485-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Global precedence''' occurs when an individual more readily identifies the global feature when presented with a stimulus containing both global and local features.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  The global aspect of an object embodies the larger, overall image as a whole, whereas the local aspect consists of the individual features that make up this larger whole. Global processing is the act of processing a visual stimulus holistically. Although global precedence is generally more prevalent than local precedence, local preference also occurs under certain circumstances and for certain individuals.&lt;ref name=Himba&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davidoff|first=J.|author2=E. Fonteneau |author3=J. Fagot |title=Local and global processing: Observations from a remote culture|journal=Cognition|date=Sep 2008|volume=108|issue=3|pages=702–709|doi=10.1016/j.cognition.2008.06.004|pmid=18662813}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Global precedence is closely related to the  [[Principles of grouping|Gestalt principles of grouping]] in that the global whole is a grouping of proximal and similar objects. Within global precedence, there is also the global interference effect, which occurs when an individual is directed to identify the local characteristic, and the global characteristic subsequently interferes by slowing the reaction time.

==Basic methods==
Global precedence was first studied using the [[Navon figure]], where many small letters are arranged to form a larger letter that either does or does not match.&lt;ref name="Navon original"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Navon|first=D.|journal=Cognitive Psychology|date=Jul 1977|volume=9|issue=3|pages=353–383|doi=10.1016/0010-0285(77)90012-3|title=Forest before trees: The precedence of global features in visual perception}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variations of the original Navon figure include both shapes and objects.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli" /&gt;  
Individuals presented with a Navon figure will be given one of two tasks. In one type of task, participants are told before the presentation of the stimulus whether to focus on a global or local level, and their accuracy and reaction times are recorded.

[[File:Targetstimulus.png|thumb]]
In another type of task, participants are first presented with a target stimulus, and later presented with two different visuals. One of the visuals matches the target stimulus on the global level, while the other visual matches the target stimulus on the local level. In this condition, experimenters note which of the two visuals, the global or local, is chosen to match the target stimulus.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;

==Specific results and theories==

===Navon's original study===
In general, reaction time for identifying the larger letter is faster than for the smaller letters that make up the shape.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Navon directed participants to focus either globally or locally to stimuli that were consistent, neutral, or conflicting on the global and local levels (see figures above).&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Reaction time for global identification was much faster than for local identification, showing global precedence.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Additionally, global interference effect, which occurs when the global aspect is automatically processed even when attention is directed locally, causes slow reaction time.&lt;ref name="Navon original" /&gt;  Navon's study  global precedence and his stimuli, or variations of it, are still used in nearly all global precedence experiments.

===Racial differences===
When presented with a Navon figure, there is a slight local preference for Caucasians, but East Asians show an obvious global preference and are faster and more accurate at global processing.&lt;ref name=Race&gt;{{cite journal|last=McKone|first=E.|author2=Davies, A.A. |author3=Fernando, D. |author4=Aalders, R. |author5=Leung, H. |author6=Wickramariyaratne, T. |author7=Platow, M.J. |title=Asia has the global advantage: Race and visual attention|journal=Vision Research|date=July 2010|volume=50|issue=16|pages=1540–1549|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2010.05.010 |pmid=20488198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inclination towards global precedence is also evident in second generation Asian-Australians, but the correlation is weaker than that of recent immigrants.  This could stem from the physical environment of East Asian versus Western cities, as the level of visual complexity varies across these environments.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt; The tendency of Caucasians to process information "analytically" and Asians "holistically" has also been attributed to differences in brain structure.&lt;ref name="Chee, Michael Wei Liang, et al. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chee | first1 = M. W. L. | last2 = Zheng | first2 = H. | last3 = Goh | first3 = J. O. S. | last4 = Park | first4 = D. | last5 = Sutton | first5 = B. P. | year = 2011 | title = Brain structure in young and old East Asians and Westerners: comparisons of structural volume and cortical thickness | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 23 | issue = 5| pages = 1065–1079 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2010.21513 | pmid=20433238 | pmc=3361742}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some cognitive scientists, the stark contrast in cognitive processing trends across cultures and races suggests that all studies on cognitive perception should report participants’ races to ensure valid theoretical conclusions.  Especially in experiments involving spatially distributed stimuli, neglected racial or cultural differences in visual perception could skew results.&lt;ref name="Race"/&gt;

===Cultural differences===
Global precedence is not a universal phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Himba /&gt;

When Navon figure stimuli are presented to participants from a remote African culture, the [[Himba people|Himba]], local precedence is observed although the Himba show the capabilities for both global and local processing.&lt;ref name=Himba /&gt;

This difference in precedence for Navon figure stimuli can be attributed to cultural differences in occupations, or in the practice of reading and writing. This finding dispels the idea that local precedence is a consequence or symptom of disorders, since the Himba is a normally functioning society capable of both global and local processing.&lt;ref name=Himba /&gt;

===Varying stimuli===
Stimuli are either meaningful or meaningless. For example, letters and familiar objects, like a cup, are meaningful, while unidentifiable and non-geometric forms are not. In both types of stimuli, the global advantage is observed, but the global interference effect only occurs with meaningful stimuli.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poirel|first=N.|author2=A. Pineau |author3=E. Mellet |title=What does the nature of the stimuli tell us about the global precedence effect?|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=2008|volume=127|issue=1|pages=1–11|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2006.12.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, when the global object is meaningful, the reaction time for identification of the local feature increases.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:meaningless stimulus.jpg|thumb]] --&gt;

This supports the theory that within global precedence, global advantage and global interference rely on two separate mechanisms. Global-local interference occurs as a result of [[Automaticity|automatic processing]] of global objects. The theory is that the global precedence effect has a [[Sensory system|sensory]] mechanism active in global advantage, whereas automatic and semantic processes are active in the interference effect.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Nature of Stimuli"/&gt;

===Age===
Cognitive processing varies across different age groups, and several studies have been done using Navon-like figures to examine the correlation between precedence and age.

====Children and Adolescents====
When presented with a global-local task, children and adolescents exemplify a local bias.&lt;ref name="Adolescence and Global Processing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scherf|first=K.S.|author2=Behrmann, M. |author3=Kimchi, R. |author4=Luna, B. |title=Emergence of Global Shape Processing Continues Through Adolescence|journal=Child Development|date=Jan–Feb 2009|volume=80|issue=1|pages=162–177|jstor=29738604|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2008.01252.x |pmid=19236399 |pmc=2648130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Younger children respond slower to different types of stimuli compared to older children, and thus local precedence seems more prevalent than global precedence in perceptual organization, at least until adolescence, when the transition to globally oriented visual perception begins.&lt;ref name="Adolescence and Global Processing"/&gt;  The ability to encode a global shape, which is necessary for efficiently recognizing and identifying objects, increases with age.  However, it has also been found that there is a bias towards global information during infancy, which may be based upon high spatial frequency information, as well as limited vision.  Therefore, global precedence during the early years of life may not be upwards but rather a U-shaped development.&lt;ref name="Adolescence and Global Processing"/&gt;

====Aging====
There is a decline of global precedence in older subjects.&lt;ref name=Aging&gt;{{cite journal|last=Staudinger|first=M.R.|author2=Fink, G.R. |author3=Mackay, C.E. |author4=Lux, S. |title=Gestalt perception and the decline of global precedence in older subjects.|journal=Cortex|date=Jul–Aug 2011|volume=47|issue=7|pages=854–862|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2010.08.001 |pmid=20828678}}&lt;/ref&gt;   When presented with a Navon-like figures, young adults demonstrate global precedence enhancement in that when the number of local letters forming the global letter increases, their global precedence increases. On the other hand, there is no precedence effect or enhancement for older subjects when presented with the same task.&lt;ref name="Aging"/&gt; This links global precedence to the Gestalt principles of Proximity and Continuity, and suggests that Gestalt-related deficiencies, such as decline in perceptual grouping, may underlie the decline of global precedence in older subjects.&lt;ref name="Aging"/&gt;

Global precedence decline may also relate to hemispheric specialization.  The spatial frequency theory proposes that global versus local information is processed through two “channels” of low (global) versus high (local) spatial frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shulman|first=G.L.|title=The role of spatial-frequency channels in the perception of local and global structure.|journal=Perception|year=1986|volume=15|pages=259–273|doi=10.1068/p150259}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[spatial frequency]] measures how often a stimulus moves through space. Based upon this theory, the double frequency theory links the left hemisphere with high spatial frequencies, leading to a global precedence effect, and the right hemisphere with low spatial frequencies, leading to a local precedence effect.  This suggests neuropsychological factors behind global precedence decline in there may be faster aging in the right than the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Aging"/&gt;

===Affect===
Studies regarding mood have shown that positive and negative cues can influence global versus local attention during image-based tasks.

====Self-generated emotional primes====
Some studies have shown that positive priming decreases local response time, demonstrating a lessening effect of global precedence, while negative priming increases local response time.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Mood"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumann|first=N.|author2=J. Kuhl|title=Positive affect and flexibility: overcoming the precedence of global over local processing of visual information|journal=Motivation and Emotion|year=2005|volume=29|issue=2|pages=123–134|doi=10.1007/s11031-005-7957-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mood dictates one's preferences for processing type.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Mood" /&gt;

The result that negative priming reduces flexibility correlates to the [[Psi-Theory|Psi theory]] states that negative emotion inhibits one’s access to extension memory, reducing [[cognitive flexibility]]. This also supports the theory that positive affect increases cognitive flexibility.&lt;ref name="Global Precedence and Mood" /&gt;

====Standardized emotional primes====
Positive mood priming also increases cognitive flexibility when prime words do not have individualistic specificity and when primes are visual.&lt;ref name="Priming and global precedence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tan|first=H.K. |author2=G.V. Jones |author3=D.G. Watson|title=Encouraging the perceptual underdog: Positive affective priming of nonpreferred local–global processes|journal=Emotion|year=2009|volume=9|issue=2|pages=238–247|doi=10.1037/a0014713}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Positive affect does not simply promote local processing, but rather improves one’s abilities in his non-preferred dimension.&lt;ref name="Priming and global precedence" /&gt;  For example, one preferring the local aspect of stimuli would show increased performance in identifying the global aspect and vice versa. This further supports the cognitive flexibility theory.

However, many studies regarding global processing and affect conflict with each other. One particular study showed that individuals in happy moods are more likely than those in sad moods to identify images based on global attributes rather than local ones, contrary to other studies that have been conducted.&lt;ref name=Mood&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gasper|first=K.|author2=Clore, G.L.|title=Attending the Big Picture: Mood and Global versus Local Processing of Visual Information|journal=Psychological Science|date=January 2002|volume=13|issue=1|pages=34–40|jstor=40063692|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00406}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Paying attention to global features is the standard strategy for visual processing.  Therefore, if positive feelings are more frequent than negative feelings, and thus positive feelings are more accessible, then positive feelings should instigate global processing more than negative feelings because the global strategy is similarly more accessible.&lt;ref name="Mood"/&gt;  From a more worldly application, positive affect might aid in understanding the larger meaning of stimuli like literature or art, whereas negative affect might aid understanding more minute details within those stimuli, like particularly rhythmic words or the nuance of colors.&lt;ref name="Mood"/&gt;

===Faces===

====Navon bias====
Priming with Navon figures aides the recognition of faces, a holistic task, when the response elicited from the figure matches the precedence of the figure.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perfect|first=T.J. |author2=N.J. Weston |author3=I. Dennis |author4=A. Snell|title=The effects of precedence on Navon-induced processing bias in face recognition|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=2008|volume=61|issue=10|pages=1479–1486|doi=10.1080/17470210802034678}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For example, if the stimulus has local precedence and the participant is cued to respond with the local feature identification, his accuracy in facial recognition improves. The same occurs when global responses are asked of global stimuli.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition" /&gt;

When a facial task requires local processing for identification, participants’ facial recognition improves when they must respond to global precedence stimuli with local responses and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition" /&gt; They are forced to show cognitive flexibility in their responses to the Navon figure primes.

One theory explains that normal facial recognition requires automatic processes, whereas special facial recognition requires controlled processes.&lt;ref name="Navon Biasa and Face Recognition" /&gt;  Automatic processes are aided by correlative stimuli and responses, while controlled processes are aided by stimuli and responses that do not correlate. This indicates that facial recognition depends on type of attention, automatic or controlled, rather than focus on global or local features.

====Face inversion====
When identifying inverted faces, those showing stronger global precedence show a more prominent&lt;ref name="Face inversion and global precedence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=D.|author2=C.N. Macrae|title=Processing style and person recognition: Exploring the face inversion effect|journal=Visual Cognition|year=2010|volume=18|issue=2|pages=161–170|doi=10.1080/13506280902868793}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those showing a stronger global precedence also have a greater deficit in identification abilities when the faces are inverted; their identification abilities decrease more from upright identification to inverted identification than weak global precedence individuals.&lt;ref name="Face inversion and global precedence" /&gt;

This correlates to the theory that upright faces are processed holistically, or with a special mechanism.&lt;ref name="Face inversion and global precedence" /&gt;  Those with stronger global precedence should perform better at holistically processing a face upright. Stronger global precedence should show a greater decrease in accuracy of identification of inverted faces because the task relies on local processing.

===Individual characteristics===
The degree of global precedence one demonstrates has been found to differ in relation to the variable of an individual's [[field dependence]].&lt;ref name="Individual Characteristics and global precedence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Poirel|first=N.|author2=A. Pineau |author3=G. Jobard |author4=E. Mellet |title=Seeing the forest before the trees depends on individual field-dependency characteristics|journal=Experimental Psychology|year=2008|volume=55|issue=5|pages=328–333|doi=10.1027/1618-3169.55.5.328}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Field dependency is the amount that one relies on Gestalt laws of perceptual organization. High field dependency corresponds to a greater bias toward the global level, while field independence corresponds to a lesser dependency on the global level.&lt;ref name="Individual Characteristics and global precedence"/&gt;

This indicates that individual characteristics have an effect on the prevalence of global precedence and that global and local processing exist on a continuum.&lt;ref name="Individual Characteristics and global precedence"/&gt;

===Physiological explanation===
Neuropsychological evidence based on PET scans suggests that the global aspect of visual situations activates and is processed preferentially by the [[right hemisphere]], whereas the local aspect of visual situations activates and is processed preferentially by the left hemisphere.&lt;ref name=hemispheres&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fink|first=J.C.|author2=Marshall, P.W. |author3=Halligan, C.D. |author4=Frith, R.S.J. |author5=Frackowiak, R. |title=Hemispheric Specialization for Global and Local Processing: The Effect of Stimulus Category|journal=Proceedings: Biological Sciences|date=Apr 1997|volume=264|issue=1381|pages=487–494|jstor=50536 .|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0070|pmc=1688391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The classical view of [[Gestalt psychology]] also suggests the right hemisphere is involved in the perception of wholes and thus plays a stronger role in global processing, whereas the left hemisphere involves separate local elements and therefore plays a stronger role in local processing.&lt;ref name="hemispheres"/&gt;

However, hemispheric specialization is relative because it depends on the experimental setting as well as the individual’s “attentional set.”&lt;ref name="hemispheres"/&gt; In addition, stimulus type may influence the neural structures underlying hemispheric specialization. Global processing is the default strategy for most individuals, but local stimuli are often more perceptually demanding to recognize and identify, showing the effect of stimuli on visual processing.&lt;ref name="hemispheres"/&gt;

==Disorders==
The Navon figure has been used in relating theories regarding processing to assessing cognitive learning disabilities, such as [[Dyslexia|developmental dyslexia]], [[dyscalculia]], [[obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]], and [[autism]].

===Dyslexia===
When given a Navon figure test, people with dyslexia have difficulty automatically identifying [[grapheme]]s with [[phoneme]]s, but not with identifying numbers with magnitudes.&lt;ref name=Dyslexia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubinsten|first=O.|author2=Henik, A.|title=Double dissociation of functions in developmental dyslexia and dyscalculia.|journal=Journal of Educational Psychology|date=November 2006|volume=98|issue=4|pages=854–867|doi=10.1037/0022-0663.98.4.854}}&lt;/ref&gt;    On the other hand, people with dyscalculia have difficulty automatically identifying numbers with magnitudes, but not letters and with phonemes.  This suggests a dissociation between subjects with dyslexia and dyscalculia.  These developmental learning disabilities do not cause general problems with identifying symbols to their mental representations, but rather create specific challenges.&lt;ref name="Dyslexia"/&gt;

===Obsessive compulsive disorder===
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD) subjects are prone to be distracted by the local aspects of stimuli when asked to identify global aspects of figures such as the Navon figure.&lt;ref name=Obsessive-compulsive&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yovel|first=I.|author2=Revelle, W. |author3=Mineka, S. |title=Who Sees Trees before Forest? The Obsessive-Compulsive Style of Visual Attention|journal=Psychological Science|date=February 2005|volume=16|issue=2|pages=123–129|jstor=40064188|doi=10.1111/j.0956-7976.2005.00792.x|pmid=15686578}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is likely because individuals with OCPD characteristically have sharp, detail-oriented attentions, and tend to focus more on specifics rather than the larger context.&lt;ref name="Obsessive-compulsive"/&gt;

===Autism===
There are correlations between global or local performance on a task and the abilities to identify emotion and [[canine age]] for autistic children.&lt;ref name=Autism&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gross|first=T.F.|title=Global-Local Precedence in the Perception of Facial Age and Emotional Expression by Children with Autism and other Developmental Disabilities|journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders|date=Dec 2005|volume=35|issue=6|pages=773–785|doi=10.1007/s10803-005-0023-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In both cases, global responses correlate to better identification.&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;  In general, autistic children demonstrate much weaker global precedence than those without the disorder.&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;  Within the group of autistic children, those who respond more globally to a discrimination task perform better on emotion and canine age tasks.&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;

One explanation is a possible biological dysfunction in the brain region where facial processing occurs. Research indicates that global processing, facial recognition, and emotional expression recognition are all linked to the [[right hemisphere]].&lt;ref name=Autism /&gt;  A defect in that area would explain the characteristics of autism. For further information on facial recognition and processing in individuals with autism see the autism and facial recognition section of [[face perception]].

[[File:Green Beard Effect.svg|thumb|upright|The Green-beard effect is a form of selection in which individuals with genes that produce unique observable traits select individuals with the specific trait and thereby the same gene. In this illustration individuals selectively mate with individuals of the same head color.]]

The '''green-beard effect''' is a [[thought experiment]] used in [[evolutionary biology]] to explain selective [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]] among individuals of a species. Altruistic behaviour is paradoxical when viewed in the light of old ideas of evolutionary theory that emphasised the role of competition. The evolution of altruism is better explained through the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], which emphasizes an interpretation of [[natural selection]] from the point of view of the [[gene]] which acts as an agent that has the metaphorical "selfish goal" of maximizing its own propagation. A gene for (behavioral) selective altruism can be favored by (natural) selection if the altruism is primarily directed at other individuals who share the gene. Since genes are invisible, such an effect requires perceptible markers for altruistic behaviour to occur.

A green-beard effect occurs when an [[allele]], or a set of [[Genetic linkage|linked]] alleles, produce three expressed (or [[phenotype|phenotypic]]) effects: 
*a perceptible [[Trait (biology)|trait]]&amp;mdash;the hypothetical "green beard"
*recognition of this trait by others; and
*preferential treatment of individuals with the trait

The carrier of the gene (or a specific allele) is essentially recognizing copies of the same gene (or a specific allele) in other individuals.  Whereas [[kin selection]] involves altruism to related individuals who share genes in a non-specific way, green-beard alleles promote altruism toward individuals who share a gene that is expressed by a specific phenotypic trait. Some authors also note that the green-beard effects can include "spite" for individuals lacking the "green-beard" gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Altruism, Spite, and Greenbeards|author1=West, Stuart A. | author2=Gardner, Andy| journal=Science| volume=327| year=2010| pages=1341–1344|url=http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/pdf/West&amp;Gardner_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can have the effect of delineating a subset of organisms within a population that is characterized by members who show greater cooperation toward each other, this forming a "clique" that can be advantageous to its members who are not necessarily kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gardner, Andy|author2=West, Stuart A.|year=2010| volume=64| issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00842.x| pages=25–38| title=Greenbeards| journal=Evolution}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green-beard effect could increase altruism on green-beard phenotypes and therefore its presence in a population even if genes assist in the increase of genes that are not exact copies; all that is required is that they express the three required characteristics. Green-beard alleles are vulnerable to mutations that produce the perceptible trait without the helping behaviour.

The idea of a green-beard allele was proposed by [[W. D. Hamilton|William D. Hamilton]] in his articles of 1964,&lt;ref name="pmid5875341"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hamilton WD | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. I | journal =  [[J Theor Biol]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–16 |date=July 1964 | pmid = 5875341 | url = | doi =10.1016/0022-5193(64)90038-4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5875340"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hamilton WD | title = The genetical evolution of social behaviour. II | journal =  [[J Theor Biol]] | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–52 |date=July 1964 | pmid = 5875340 | url = | doi =10.1016/0022-5193(64)90039-6  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and got the name from the example used by [[Richard Dawkins]] (''"I have a green beard and I will be altruistic to anyone else with green beard"'') in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="TheSelfishGene"&gt;{{cite book | author = Dawkins, Richard | title = The Selfish Gene | publisher = Oxford University Press, Oxford |isbn=0-19-217773-7 | year = 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt;

==Examples==
Evolutionary biologists have debated the potential validity of green-beard genes, suggesting that it would be extraordinarily rare for a single or even a set of linked genes to produce three complex phenotypic effects. This criticism has led some to believe that they simply cannot exist or that they only can be present in less complex organisms, such as microorganisms. Several discoveries within the past ten years have illuminated the validity of this critique.

The concept remained a merely theoretical possibility under Dawkins' selfish gene model until 1998, when a green-beard allele was first found in nature, in the [[red imported fire ant]] (''Solenopsis invicta'').&lt;ref name=Grafen/&gt;&lt;ref name=invicta/&gt; [[Polygyne]] colony queens are [[heterozygous]] (Bb) at the Gp-9 gene locus. Their worker offspring can have both heterozygous (Bb) and [[homozygous]] (BB) genotypes. The investigators discovered that homozygous dominant (BB) queens, which in the wild form produce [[monogyne]] rather than polygyne colonies, are specifically killed when introduced into polygyne colonies, most often by heterozygous (Bb) and not homozygous (BB) workers. They concluded that the allele Gp-9&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; is linked to a greenbeard allele which induces workers bearing this allele to kill all queens that do not have it. A final conclusion notes that the workers are able to distinguish BB queens from Bb queens based on an odor cue.&lt;ref name=invicta /&gt;

The gene csA in the [[slime mould]] ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'', discovered in 2003,&lt;ref name=discoideum/&gt; codes for a [[cell adhesion]] protein which binds to gp80 proteins on other cells, allowing multicellular fruiting body formation on soil.  Mixtures of csA [[gene knockout|knockout]] cells with wild-type cells yield [[spores]], "born" from the fruiting bodies, which are 82% wild-type (WT).  This is because the wild-type cells are better at adhering and more effectively combine into aggregates; knockout (KO) cells are left behind.  On more adhesive but less natural substances, KO cells can adhere; WT cells, still better at adhering, sort preferentially into the stalk.&lt;ref name=discoideum /&gt;

In 2006, green beard-like recognition was seen in the cooperative behavior among color morphs in side-blotched lizards, although the traits appear to be encoded by multiple loci across the genome.&lt;ref name="pmid16651531"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinervo B, Chaine A, Clobert J, Calsbeek R, Hazard L, Lancaster L, McAdam AG, Alonzo S, Corrigan G, Hochberg ME | title = Self-recognition, color signals, and cycles of greenbeard mutualism and altruism | journal =  Proc Natl Acad Sci USA | volume = 103 | issue = 19 | pages = 7372–7377 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16651531 | url = | doi =10.1073/pnas.0510260103 | pmc = 1564281 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent example, found in 2008, is a gene that makes [[brewer's yeast]] clump together in response to a toxin such as alcohol.&lt;ref name=Prakash/&gt; By investigating [[flocculation]], a type of self-adherence generally present in asexual aggregations, Smukalla ''et al.'' showed that ''S. cerevisiae'' is a model for cooperative behavior evolution. When this yeast expresses FLO1 in the laboratory, flocculation is restored.  Flocculation is apparently protective for the FLO1+ cells, which are shielded from certain stresses (ethanol, for example).  In addition FLO1+ cells preferentially adhere to each other.  The authors therefore conclude that flocculation is driven by this greenbeard allele.&lt;ref name=cerevisiae/&gt;

A mammalian example appears to be the reproductive strategy of the [[wood mouse]], which shows cooperation among spermatozoa. Single sperms hook in each other to form sperm-trains, which are able to move faster together than single sperm would do.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt;

It has been suggested that [[speciation]] could be possible through the manifestation of a green-beard effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1554/0014-3820(2003)057[0154:SMS]2.0.CO;2 |title=Socially mediated speciation| author1=Hochberg,  Michael E. |author2=Sinervo, Barry |author3=Brown, Sam P. | journal=Evolution| volume= 57|issue=1|pages=154–158| year=2003|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/~barrylab/classes/game_theory/HochbergEvo2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been pointed out that both the biological and cultural aspects of language are bestowed with green beard recognition systems, thus providing insights into the evolution of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindenfors|first=Patrik|date=2013-02-27|title=The green beards of language|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/ece3.506|journal=Ecology and Evolution|language=en|volume=3|issue=4|pages=1104–1112|doi=10.1002/ece3.506|issn=2045-7758|pmc=3631417|pmid=23610647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accessed 20 November 2010. &lt;www.peoples-law.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This type of discrimination can lead to [[housing inequality|housing and spatial inequality]] and [[racial segregation]] which, in turn, can exacerbate wealth disparities between certain groups. In the [[United States]], housing discrimination began after the abolition of [[slavery]] as part of a federally sponsored law, but has since been made illegal; however, studies show that housing discrimination still exists.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"&gt;Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane. 2005.

==History==
After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery, [[Jim Crow laws]] were introduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/what.htm|title=Jim Crow Museum: Origins of Jim Crow|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws led to the discrimination of racial and ethnic minorities, especially [[African American]]s. Fifteen state courts obeyed ordinances that enforced the denial of housing to African American and other minority groups in white-zoned areas. These ordinances were then made illegal in the 1917 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case, ''[[Buchanan v. Warley]]''. Following this decision, however, nineteen states legally supported "covenants," or agreements, between property owners to not rent or sell any homes to racial or ethnic minorities. Although the covenants, too, were made illegal in 1948, they were still allowed to be present in private deeds.&lt;ref&gt;Silver, Christopher (1997).

Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publ.. {{ISBN|0-8039-7233-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the Fair Housing Act, enacted as Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], that the federal government made its first concrete steps to deem all types of housing discrimination unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;"President Signs Civil Rights Bill; Pleads for Calm" New York Times, April 12, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; The act explicitly prohibits housing discrimination practices common at the time, including filtering information about a home's availability, [[racial steering]], [[blockbusting]], and [[redlining]].&lt;ref&gt;Yinger, John. 1998. "Closed Doors Opportunities Lost: the continuing cost of housing Discrimination." New York: Russell Sage Foundation {{ISBN|0-87154-968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fair Housing Act===
{{main|Fair Housing Act (United States)}}
The [[Fair Housing Act]] was passed at the urging of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the federal Fair Housing Act (codified at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode42/usc_sup_01_42_10_45_20_I.html 42 U.S.C. 3601-3619], penalties for violation at [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3631- 42 U.S.C. 3631]), Title VIII of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1968]], only one week after the [[assassination]] of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

The primary purpose of the Fair Housing Law of 1968 is to protect the buyer/renter of a dwelling from seller/landlord discrimination. Its primary prohibition makes it unlawful to refuse to sell, rent to, or negotiate with any person because of that person's inclusion in a [[protected class]].&lt;ref name=legal-dict&gt;[http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fair+Housing+Act+of+1968 Definition of ''Fair Housing Act of 1968'' ], Legal Dictionary at TheFreeDictionary.com, Farlex Company. Accessed 15 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal is a unitary housing market in which a person's background (as opposed to financial resources) does not arbitrarily restrict access. Calls for open housing were issued early in the twentieth century, but it was not until after [[World War II]] that concerted efforts to achieve it were undertaken.

The Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) introduced meaningful federal enforcement mechanisms. It outlawed:

* Refusal to sell or rent a dwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.
* Discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin in the terms, conditions or privilege of the sale or rental of a dwelling.
*Advertising the sale or rental of a dwelling indicating preference of discrimination based on race, color, religion or national origin.
*Coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with a person's enjoyment or exercise of housing rights based on discriminatory reasons or retaliating against a person or organization that aids or encourages the exercise or enjoyment of fair housing rights.

When the Fair Housing Act was first enacted, it prohibited discrimination only on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.&lt;ref name=hud&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/progdesc/title8|title=Title VIII: Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity - HUD|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, disability and familial status (the presence or anticipated presence of children under 18 in a household) were added (further codified in the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] of 1990).&lt;ref name=hud/&gt; In certain circumstances, the law allows limited exceptions for discrimination based on sex, religion, or familial status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.craigslist.org/about/FHA.html | title = Fair Housing is Everyone's Right! | publisher = Craigslist | accessdate = October 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] is the [[United States federal executive departments|federal executive department]] with the statutory authority to administer and enforce the Fair Housing Act. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development has delegated fair housing enforcement and compliance activities to HUD's [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] (FHEO) and HUD's Office of General Counsel.  FHEO is one of the United States' largest federal civil rights agencies.  It has a staff of more than 600 people located in 54 offices around the United States. As of June 2014, the head of FHEO is Assistant Secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity Gustavo Velasquez, whose appointment was confirmed on June 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PN1349 — Gustavo Velasquez Aguilar|url=https://www.congress.gov/nomination/113th-congress/1349|website=Congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who believe they have experienced housing discrimination can file a complaint with FHEO at no charge. FHEO funds and has working agreements with many state and local governmental agencies where "substantially equivalent" fair housing laws are in place. Under these agreements, FHEO refers complaints to the state or locality where the alleged incident occurred, and those agencies investigate and process the case instead of FHEO.  This is known as FHEO's [[Fair Housing Assistance Program]] (or "[[FHAP]]").

There is also a network of private, non-profit fair housing advocacy organizations throughout the country.  Some are funded by FHEO's [[Fair Housing Initiatives Program]] (or "[[FHIP]]"), and some operate with private donations or grants from other sources.

Victims of housing discrimination need not go through HUD or any other governmental agency to pursue their rights, however. The Fair Housing Act confers jurisdiction to hear cases on federal district courts.  The [[United States Department of Justice]] also has jurisdiction to file cases on behalf of the United States where there is a pattern and practice of discrimination or where HUD has found discrimination in a case and either party elects to go to federal court instead of continuing in the HUD administrative process.

The Fair Housing Act applies to landlords renting or leasing space in their [[primary residence]] only if the residence contains living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by three or more other families living independently of each other, such as an owner-occupied rooming house.

====Enforcement====
The Fair Housing Act has been strengthened since its adoption in 1968, but enforcement continues to be a concern among housing advocates. According to a 2010 evaluation of Analysis of Impediments (AI) reports done by the Government Accountability Office, enforcement is particularly inconsistent across local jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=US Government Accountability Office|title=Housing and community grants: HUD needs to enhance its requirements and oversight of jurisdictions' fair housing plans|year=2010|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsequent developments===
The federal government has passed other initiatives in addition to the [[Fair Housing Act of 1968]]. The [[Equal Credit Opportunity Act]] of 1974 and [[Community Reinvestment Act]] of 1977 helped with discrimination in mortgage lending and lenders' problems with credit needs.&lt;ref name="Justice"&gt;http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/hce/housing_coverage.php Department of Justice&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was passed to give the federal government the power to enforce the original Fair Housing Act to correct past problems with enforcement.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"&gt;Yinger, John. 2001. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MVP_f-RPLWcC&amp;pg=PA499 “Housing Discrimination and Residential Segregation as Causes of Poverty,”] in Sheldon H. Danzinger and Robert H. Haveman, eds. Understanding Poverty. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, {{ISBN|0-674-00876-6}} pp. 382 ff&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment established a system of administrative law judges to hear cases brought to them by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and to levy fines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/FHLaws/yourrights|title=Fair Housing -- It's Your Right - HUD|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the relationship between housing discrimination cases and private agencies, the federal government passed the two initiatives. The Fair Housing Assistance Program of 1984 was passed to assist public agencies with processing complaints, and the Fair Housing Initiatives program of 1986 supported private and public fair housing agencies in their activities, such as auditing.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Between 1990 and 2001 these two programs have resulted in over one thousand housing discrimination lawsuits and over $155 million in financial recovery.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; However, the lawsuits and financial recoveries generated from fair housing discrimination cases only scratches the surface of all instances of discrimination. Silverman and Patterson concluded that the underfunding and poor implementation of federal, state and local policies designed to address housing discrimination results in less than 1% of all instances of discrimination being addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Robert Mark and Patterson, Kelly L. 2012. "The Four Horsemen of the Fair Housing Apocalypse: A Critique of Fair Housing Policy in the USA." Critical Sociology 38(1): 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, they found that local nonprofits and administrators responsible for enforcing fair housing laws had a tendency to downplay discrimination based on family status and race when designing implementation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;	Patterson, Kelly L. and Robert Mark Silverman. 2011. "How Local Public Administrators, Nonprofit Providers and Elected Officials Perceive Impediments to Fair Housing in the Suburbs: An Analysis of Erie County, New York," Housing Policy Debate 21(1): 165-188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Census]] has shown that ethnic and racial minorities living in concentrated, high-poverty areas had actually increased following the passage of the Fair Housing Act from 1970 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.census.gov/ U.S. Census&lt;/ref&gt; African-Americans residing in these areas rose from 16 percent to 24 percent, and Hispanics living in these areas have increased from 10 percent to 15 percent.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"&gt;Massey, Douglas S. 2004. "The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America," in C.Michael Henry, ed. Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy. New Haven: Yale University Press {{ISBN|0-300-09541-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this does not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, it does mirror the phenomenon of white flight—the mass exodus during the 1970s and '80s of European-Americans from cities to the suburbs that left only one-fourth of the Anglo population still living in metropolitan areas. American sociologist [[Douglas Massey]], in his essay, "The New Geography of Inequality in Urban America", argues that this new racial geography in the United States has laid the foundation for housing discrimination to occur in order to keep up the status quo.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt;

==Types==
Sociologists Vincent J. Roscigno, Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester have determined that the variety of actions that constitute housing discrimination can be classified as either exclusionary or nonexclusionary.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"&gt;Roscigno, Vincent J., Diana L. Karafin, and Griff Tester, 2009 [http://www.thecyberhood.net/documents/papers/roscigno09.pdf “The Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination,”] Social Problems, Vol. 56, No. 1. University of California Press. pp.49-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusionary===
Exclusionary discrimination practices refer to "actions and practices that exclude an individual or family from obtaining the housing of their choosing." These forms of housing discrimination occur at various stages of the rental or sales process.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; The majority of discriminatory actors in exclusionary discrimination are landlords and landowners, as they have the positional power and direct access to the individual or family and the housing being sought. Other discriminatory actors or institutions responsible for exclusion include real estate, insurance, and banking and lending agents and institutions.&lt;ref name="South, S. J."&gt;South, S. J., &amp; Crowder, K. D. (1998). Housing discrimination and residential mobility: Impacts for blacks and whites. Population Research and Policy Review, 17(4), 369-369-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most exclusionary discrimination cases entail forms of outright exclusion, such as a direct refusal to rent to a prospective tenant, direct refusal to sell or discuss the sale of a property, or the false representation of homes or apartments available for sale or rent. Although this outright exclusion is often made up of subtle actions, like lying about standards for rental qualification to disqualify certain individuals, it sometimes also comes with overt verbal abuse and slurs.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Other exclusionary cases entail discriminatory terms and conditions pertaining to the sale or rental of an apartment or home with the purpose of denying access. These forms include unfair financing or loan qualifications or terms, steering or restricting the choices of people seeking homes, differential criteria to qualify to rent a home, and refusing to provide insurance, which would prevent the individual or family from acquiring a home.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Consumer advocate groups conducted studies and found that many minority borrowers who were eligible for affordable, traditional loans were often steered toward incredibly high-priced subprime loans that they would never be able to repay.&lt;ref name="Fair Lending and Accountability"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/08/opinion/fair-lending-and-accountability.html?scp=14&amp;sq=housing%20discrimination&amp;st=cse "Fair Lending and Accountability"] New York Times, September 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by the [[U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) found that "the greatest share of discrimination for Hispanic and African American home seekers can still be attributed to being told units are unavailable when they are available to non-Hispanic whites and being shown and told about less units than a comparable non-minority."&lt;ref name="HUD study"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huduser.org/portal/publications/hsgfin/hds.html|title=Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS) - HUD USER|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonexclusionary===
Nonexclusionary discrimination practices refer to "actions and practices that occur within an already established housing arrangement, most often entailing racial harassment, differential treatment of tenants, or disparate application of contractual terms and conditions of residency."&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;  Individuals and families already housed experience ongoing intimidation, differential treatment, and harassment, and nonexclusionary discrimination often results in distress for victims since the victim is often legally bound to the home and usually has direct contact with the perpetrator on a regular basis. Landlords and owners are still responsible for the majority of this type of housing discrimination, but neighbors and banking and lending institutions participate more. For instance, even without institutionalized exclusionary power, residential neighbors can harass and intimidate tenants.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Most nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve applying discriminatory terms and conditions within the victim's current residential setting. The majority of these cases involve terms, conditions, and privileges relating to a current rental arrangement. These cases are often seen as unfairly raising the rent of a select group or allowing certain tenants privileges, like using a facility after hours or being lenient on pet policies.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Many nonexclusionary discrimination cases involve the failure to provide equal access to services and facilities, such as purposely delaying or completely forgoing fixing a broken pipe. More terms and conditions cases involve discriminatory financing, loans, and appraisals of the individual or family's property, which is when the discriminatory actor takes advantage of the victim financially.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

Other forms of nonexclusionary discrimination include the use of harassment, intimidation, and coercion toward victims.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; This includes racial slurs and threats of violence, both of which create an uneasy environment in which the victims live.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawhelp.org/documents/871H-06%20Housing%20Discrimination.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These forms can cause excessive anxiety and stress for the individual or family affected. If an individual holding a position of an authority, such as the landlord, is responsible for the nonexclusionary discrimination, the victim is left with a feeling of powerlessness and lack of ability to get help.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

=== Disparate impact ===
Exclusionary and nonexclusionary describe the various disparate treatments that housing providers or agents can place upon renters and buyers. In addition to these types of housing discrimination, certain policies that do not discriminate on its face have also been found to cause housing discrimination in the United States. [[Disparate impact]] is a facially neutral housing policy that negatively impacts minorities or other protected groups of people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/crt/fcs/T6Manual7|title=Section VII- Proving Discrimination- Disparate Impact {{!}} CRT {{!}} Department of Justice|last=|first=|date=|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact was not always looked at in the housing context. It was first applied in housing discrimination in 2015 when the Court found Congress had intended to include liability for disparate impact discrimination in the Fair Housing Act and its recognition is consistent with the central purpose of the Act since it was amended in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/crt/legacy/2015/06/25/tdhcainclusiveopinion.pdf|title=Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc.|last=|first=|date=|website=The United States Department of Justice|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that case, HUD began recognizing many types of disparate impact treatment. For example, HUD published a statement concluding that blanket prohibitions against tenants with criminal convictions would constitute disparate impact housing discrimination because incarceration rates in the United States are disproportionate between minorities and non-minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/HUD_OGCGUIDAPPFHASTANDCR.PDF|title=Office of General Counsel Guidance on Application of Fair Housing Act Standards to the Use of Criminal Records by Providers of Housing and Real Estate-Related Transactions|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development|pages=3–4|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disparate impact remains controversial as some feel that their freedom in implementing policies and rules is now limited due to the fear of [[unintended consequences]] of rules that originally had no discriminatory intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/clegg_testimony_06_21_07.pdf|title=Testimony of Roger Clegg|last=|first=|date=|website=Committee on the Judiciary|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Housing discrimination practices of today==
Professor of Public Administration and Economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/jyinger/|title=John Yinger Professor of Public Administration and Economics|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expert in the field of housing discrimination studies, [[John Milton Yinger|John Yinger]], argues that discriminatory housing practices in the housing market have led to segregation and can be interpreted as forms of modern-day discrimination. One important example cited is of realtors opting to place [[Public Housing|public housing]] in crowded [[inner city]] minority neighborhoods instead of those with an Anglo majority due to "public and political pressure." &lt;ref&gt;Russell, Marcia C. 2008. Fair Housing. Dearborn: Real Estate Education Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Other housing phenomena that Yinger argues encourage segregation are those of [[sorting]] and [[bidding]] in which bidders perceived to be higher-class win out on cheaper per-square-foot, larger homes farther away from inner cities.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The study done by the U.S. Housing Scholars adds that [[school zoning]] has also been named a culprit for housing segregation, and may be used as a critical venue for housing discrimination. It also cites the Internet as yet another means for the perpetuation of housing discrimination that is, as of now, unrestricted by the provisions of the Fair Housing Act. While the Fair Housing Act strictly prohibits any sellers from using language that explicitly names a preference for a certain group, third-party sellers that use sites like Craigslist.com and Roommates.com to find buyers or renters are granted immunity from the FHA, and the websites are not held liable. This was cemented by the 2004 court case, ''[[Fair Housing Council of San Fernando Valley v. Roommates.com, LLC]]'', in which Roommates.com was not held liable for users with advertisements such as, 'looking for White Christian Male,' since the website did not have the resources to monitor and censor such usage.&lt;ref name="prrac.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prrac.org/|title=PRRAC - Poverty &amp; Race Research Action Council|publisher=|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LGBT housing discrimination===
[[File:US LGBT housing discrimination.svg|thumb|350px|States that prohibit housing discrimination based on [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]. [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] regulations require all housing providers that receive HUD funding not to discriminate against an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity.

{{legend|#0000ff|Prohibits housing discrimination based on sexual orientation only}}
{{legend|#d3d3d3|Does not factor sexual orientation or gender identity/unclear}}]]
Housing discrimination focuses more on race, but recent studies have shown a growing trend toward discrimination in the housing market against those who identify themselves as [[gay]], [[lesbian]], or [[transgender]]. Since housing discrimination based on sexual orientation was not explicitly cited in the Fair Housing Act, as of 2007, it was banned only in 17 states. In all states, same-sex couples are frequently unable to apply to public housing as a family unit, thus decreasing their chances at being accepted into the program.&lt;ref&gt;Cahil, Sean and Sarah Tobias. 2007. Policy Issues Affecting Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Families. Illinois: University of Michigan Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-472-03061-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in comprehensive study done by the Fair Housing Centers of Michigan in 2007, statistics showed that out of 120 paired-tests, almost 30 percent of same-sex couples were given higher rental rates and less encouragement to rent, both examples of nonexclusionary housing discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;"Fair Housing Commission of Michigan". 2008. Accessed December 3, 2010. &lt;www.fhcm.org&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An HUD study released in 2011 surveyed of 6,450 transgender and gender non-conforming persons and found that "19 percent reported having been refused a house or an apartment because of gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;HUD Addresses LGBT Housing Discrimination October 13, 2011 http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/10/13/hud-addresses-lgbt-housing-discrimination&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2012, HUD Secretary [[Shaun Donovan]] announced new regulations that would require all housing providers that receive HUD funding to prevent housing discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2012/HUDNo.12-014|title=HUD Secretary Shaun Donovan announces new regulations to ensure equal access to housing for all Americans regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity|publisher=[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]]|date=January 30, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These regulations went into effect on March 5, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/documents/huddoc?id=12lgbtfinalrule.pdf|title=Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity|publisher=''[[Federal Register]]''|date=February 3, 2012|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic and racial minority housing discrimination===
Ethnic and racial minorities are impacted the most by housing discrimination. Exclusionary discrimination against African Americans most often occurs in rental markets and sales markets. Families are vulnerable to exclusion, but African American women are especially overrepresented as victims, especially single African American mothers. This discriminatory exclusion is because of stereotypes concerning race and single women. The presence of children in a minority family at times is what warrants the discrimination.&lt;ref name="South, S. J."/&gt; African Americans are also the victims in most nonexclusionary cases, with African American women still overrepresented. Nonexclusionary forms of discrimination such as racial slurs and intimidation affect many minority victims. Some racial minorities suffer the purposeful neglect of service needs, such as a landlord fixing a white tenant's bathtub quickly but delaying fixing the bathtub of the minority tenant.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; Data obtained by Ohio Civil Rights Commission studied housing discrimination cases between 1988 and 2003, and of the 2,176 cases filed, 1,741 were filed by African Americans.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt; A study by HUD released in 2005 found that more and more Hispanics are facing discrimination in their housing searches.&lt;ref name="HUD study"/&gt; A 2011 article by HUD asserts that one out of five times, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders receive less favorable treatment than others when they seek housing.&lt;ref&gt;HUD Let's Put an End to Housing Discrimination http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/05/12/let-s-put-end-housing-discrimination May 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Some cases brought to the Department of Justice show that municipalities and other local government entities violated the Fair Housing Act of 1968 when they denied African Americans housing, permits, and zoning changes, or steered them toward neighborhoods with a predominantly minority population.&lt;ref name="Justice"/&gt;

==Empirical evidence==
[[Quasi-experimental]] [[audit study|audit studies]], in which equally qualified individuals of different races both participate in housing searches, have found strong evidence of racial housing discrimination in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pager |first=Devah |last2=Shepherd |first2=Hana |date=2008-01-01 |title=The Sociology of Discrimination: Racial Discrimination in Employment, Housing, Credit, and Consumer Markets |journal=Annual Review of Sociology |volume=34 |pages=181–209  |pmc=2915460 |pmid=20689680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the U.S. Census of Population in 1990, 25.3 percent of all [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Anglo-Americans]] in the U.S. lived in central city areas. The percentage of [[African American]]s living in inner cities was 56.9 percent, and the percentage of inner city [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] was 51.5 percent. [[Asian American]]s living in central cities totaled 46.3 percent. According to a more recent U.S. Census Bureau study in 2002, the average white person living in a metropolitan area lives in a neighborhood that is 80 percent Anglo and seven percent black, while the average African American lives in a neighborhood that is 33 percent white and more than 51 percent black. As of 2000, 75 percent of all African Americans lived in highly segregated communities, making them the most segregated group in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on National Statistics. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lWvi0mwqCb8C&amp;printsec=frontcover "Measuring Housing Discrimination in a National Study"]. Angela Williams Foster, Faith Mitchell, and Stephen E. Fienberg (eds.) Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press. Massey, Douglas S. 2004 {{ISBN|0-309-08325-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics do not necessarily point to evidence of housing discrimination, but rather to segregation based on historical reasons which have made ethnic and racial minorities more economically deprived, and thus prone to living in more poverty-stricken inner city areas.

===HUD study===
In a comprehensive study by the HUD in 2000, paired-tests (in which two applicants of different races but the same economic status and credit scores apply to rent or buy a house) were used to determine whether or not statistics about segregation truly pointed to housing discrimination. This study reported that although adverse treatment of racial and ethnic minorities has decreased over time, roughly 25 percent of white applicants were still favored above those who were African-American or Hispanic. About 17 percent of African American applicants and 20 percent of Hispanic applicants were subjected to adverse treatment, including receiving less information about a home or being shown fewer, lower-quality units.&lt;ref&gt;Galster, George and Stephen Ross and Margaret Turner and John Yinger, 2002 [http://www.urban.org/publications/410821.html "Discrimination in Metropolitan Housing Markets: National Results from Phase 1 of the Housing Discrimination Study (HDS),"] Working papers 2002–16. University of Connecticut: Department of Economics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects of housing discrimination==
John Yinger, a sociologist who has studied housing discrimination, argues that it is something perhaps most concretely evidenced by its effects: [[concentrated poverty]]. People who suffer from housing discrimination often live in lower-quality housing. Housing inequalities often reflect the unequal distribution of income. Poor areas suffer from educational disparities, and a poor education translates into earnings disparities. Those who earn less can only afford lower-quality housing.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Segregation, health risks, and wealth disparities all relate to poverty.&lt;ref name="Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt;

===Residential segregation===
Perhaps the most unmistakable consequence of housing discrimination is [[residential segregation]]. Housing discrimination helps reinforce residential segregation through [[mortgage discrimination]], redlining, and predatory lending practices. Racial avoidance and threats of violence also result in racial segregation.&lt;ref name= "Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt; Housing discrimination can also impact minority preferences over time, as individuals or families experiencing harassment and intimidation at their home on a daily basis may transition to more accepting neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

===Health===
Health risks are a consequence of housing discrimination. Those suffering housing discrimination and people living below the poverty threshold often rent small or low-quality housing. Lead paint left over from past years and animal pests, such as rats, can be found in older housing, resulting in serious health consequences. [[Lead poisoning|Lead]] can lead to lowered intelligence in children.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, JM (2007). "Burton's line in lead poisoning". European neurology 57 (2): 118–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Asthma is also a problem that comes with lower-quality housing, since more air pollution, dust, mold, and mildew are more likely to occur.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt;

===Neighborhood===
Neighborhood effects are also seen due to housing discrimination and residential segregation. The housing inequality that comes with living in lower-quality housing means that neighborhood amenities are lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, Amartya K. 2004. "From Income Inequality to Economic Inequality," in C. Michael Henry (ed.) Race, Poverty, and Domestic Policy, New Haven and London: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer areas offer worse education, leading to educational and employment disadvantages and a higher school dropout rate. Schools are often segregated due to the effects of housing discrimination and residential segregation, in turn hindering students' educational performance. A study conducted by the Century Foundation in Montgomery County, Md., showed that students from a low-income background enrolled in affluent schools did better than students in higher-poverty schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/opinion/22herbert.html?scp=10&amp;sq=housing%20discrimination&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Bob | last=Herbert | title=Separate and Unequal | date=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criminal activity, including gang life and drug abuse, is also more prevalent in poorer areas. The rate of teenage pregnancy has been shown to increase in these areas as well.&lt;ref name="Seitles, Marc"&gt;Seitles, Marc, 1996 [http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/landuse/Vol141/seit.htm “The Perpetuation of Racial Residential Segregation in America: Historical Discrimination, Modern Forms of Exclusion, and Inclusionary Remedies,”] Florida State University College of Law.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wealth disparities===
Sociologists [[Thomas Shapiro]] and Jessica Kenty-Drane state that [[Wealth gap in the United States|wealth disparities]] are also a result of housing discrimination, as housing discrimination acts as a barrier to homeownership. Homeowners may learn management and home repair skills, and the children of homeowners are less likely to drop out of high school or to have children as teenagers. Additionally, credit constraints limit homeownership for people with low income. Housing discrimination that keeps families from affordable loans and nicer areas with increasing property values keep victims from accumulating wealth.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; Residential segregation also leads to generational wealth disparities. Children often inherit wealth from their parents, and if parents were forced into poor-quality housing because of housing discrimination, then there is less wealth to hand down.&lt;ref name= "Shapiro, Thomas and Jessica Kenty-Drane 2005"/&gt;

==Possible solutions==
Sociologist Douglas Massey argues that housing discrimination is a moving target.&lt;ref name="Massey, Douglas S 2004"/&gt; As federal legislation concerning anti-housing discrimination policies become more effective, new forms of housing discrimination have emerged to perpetuate residential segregation, and in turn, poverty.&lt;ref name="Roscigno, Vincent 2009"/&gt;

There have been a number of solutions proposed to finally end the threat of housing discrimination and eliminate any legal loopholes in which it may operate. So far fair housing enforcement of federal legislation concerning housing discrimination has faced challenges. The main burden of enforcement falls on federal financial regulatory institutions, like the Federal Reserve Board, and the HUD.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The enforcement provisions of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 were limited, and even though the act was amended in 1988, there are still problems with enforcement since housing discrimination often happens one-on-one and is not very visible, even in audits.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; The Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 did make a system of administrative law judges to hear housing discrimination cases to help against the illegal actions. Other examples of federal legislation may include increased federal legislation enforcement, scattered-site housing,&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; or state and local enforcement on a more concentrated level.&lt;ref name="prrac.org"/&gt; Better methods of enforcement in addition to new policies are proposed to be a help. In 2010 the Justice Department under President Barack Obama made a new fair-lending unit.&lt;ref name="Fair Lending and Accountability"/&gt;

Inclusionary remedies to truly enforce [[Racial integration|integration]] are also proposed. Inclusionary housing refers to making sure that areas are integrated, and inclusionary housing increases chances for racial minorities to gain and sustain employment.&lt;ref name="Seitles, Marc"/&gt; Recently Montgomery County, Md., passed an ordinance to require new housing developments to consist of a percentage of moderately priced dwelling units, guaranteeing more affordable better housing for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;Florence W. Roisman &amp; Hilary Botein, Housing Mobility and Life Opportunities, 27 CLEARINGHOUSE REV. 335, 348 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed solutions include [[subsidies]], such as direct subsidies, project-based subsidies, household-based subsidies, and tax reductions.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; As of 2001, only 15.7 percent of poor households received federal housing subsidies, meaning a majority of people in poor households did not receive that help. Household-based subsidies have been a significant source of new housing assistance as of late.&lt;ref name="Yinger, John 2001"/&gt; HUD has handed out housing certificates to allow participants of [[Section 8 (housing)|Section 8]] to move into higher-quality housing units.&lt;ref name= "Yinger, John 2001"/&gt;

It is important to prioritize policy and city planning. Planning for sustainability does not come with a one-size fits all approach; wicked problems persist without clarity or solutions. However, looking beyond urban regimes and accepting the nexus of these regimes is the first step for change that planners can take. This can be done through the notion of Equitable Development, an approach that aims to create communities of opportunity. Inequalities oppressing low-income communities composed of diverse ethnicities are not only unethical but prove to be economically and environmentally unsustainable. Partnership between government, private sectors, and community-based organizations to manipulate public policy for the promotion of social equity, as well as, economic growth and environmental sustainability are crucial for justice.&lt;ref&gt;Blackwell, Angela Glover. "Promoting Equitable Development." (n.d.): n. pag. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imai-kit-Düsseldorf-2012.jpg|thumb|Images Against Darkness. Video art from the archive of imai, Kunst im Tunnel, Düsseldorf, 2012]]

The '''imai foundation - inter media art institute''' (also referred to as IMAI and stylized as '''imai''') was founded in 2006. It is an institution dedicated to the distribution and preservation of media art and associated activities. The foundation organizes workshops, conferences, exhibitions,&lt;ref&gt;example: Images Against Darkness. Video art from the archive of imai, KIT Kunst im Tunnel, Dusseldorf, 2012 [http://www.kunst-im-tunnel.de/e/archiv/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; research projects and case studies concerning the current questions of conservation and restoration of media art. It takes also part in discussions about preservation, presentation and distribution of media art.&lt;ref&gt;http://loop-barcelona.com/2013/fair/pool/ Loop Conference Barcelon&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.konferenz-kultur.de/Downloads/Tagungen/programm_opcen_access_aktualisiert-6.12..pdf Open Access Conference at Bauhaus Dessau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unpainted.net/en/ Unpainted media Art Fair Munich&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The main purpose for IMAI's founding was to preserve the large collection of video art tapes which the former video art distributor and media art agency 235 MEDIA held in its archive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://235media.de/ueber-uns/fakten/?lang=en&amp;ansicht=galerie 235media in Cologne - history]&lt;/ref&gt; IMAI was set up with the support of the provincial capital of Düsseldorf and the Cologne media art agency 235 MEDIA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rp-online.de/nrw/staedte/duesseldorf/stiftung-fuer-videokunst-gegruendet-aid-1.1113318 rp-online press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrw-museum.de/en/#/en/more/museums/detailview/details/musea////imai-inter-media-art-institute.html imai at nrw-museum network&lt;/ref&gt; The preservation of the video art archive was funded by the [[Kunststiftung NRW]] (art foundation NRW – of the state of North Rhine Westphalia), the 'Kulturstiftung der Länder' (cultural foundation of the Federal states). The IMAI is located in the [[NRW Forum]] at the Ehrenhof complex, built by [[Wilhelm Kreis]] in 1925-26, close to [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]] and the [[museum kunst palast]] in [[Düsseldorf]], the state capital of North Rhine-Westfalia. The institute is directed by Dr. Renate Buschmann.&lt;ref&gt;http://www02.zkm.de/digitalartconservation/index.php/en/symposium-i/37-renate-buschmann.html zkm Renate Buschmann&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archives and collections ==
Now the IMAI archive includes approximately 3,000 artistic and documentary works from the era of the 1960s to present.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duesseldorf-tourismus.de/en/art-culture/museums-and-more/museums/imai-inter-media-art-institute/&lt;/ref&gt; The particular focus is on [[video art]] and documentaries. The collection includes US-American, Asian and European artists now considered some of the pioneers of this relatively young artistic genre, with main focus on works from the end of the 1970s and early 1980s. Audiovisual works, particularly  single-channel works, are at the archive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline-katalog.de/customize/index.html imai video art database&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netzwerk-mediatheken.de/html/partner/profile/imai.html network Mediatheken&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the artists represented by IMAI include: [[Steina and Woody Vasulka]], [[George Barber (artist)|George Barber]], [[Dara Birnbaum]], [[Klaus vom Bruch]], [[Douglas Davis (artist)|Douglas Davis]], [[Valie Export]], [[Ken Feingold]], [[Paul Garrin]], [[Ulrike Rosenbach]], [[Kirsten Geisler]], [[Gary Hill]], [[Dara Birnbaum]], [[Nan Hoover]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/204/6/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Valie Export]], [[Jürgen Klauke]], [[Robert Cahen]], and [[Marcel Odenbach]].

== Case studies ==
During its ongoing its ongoing research project to restore media art installations (since 2006), IMAI uses individual case studies to test groundbreaking restoration methods which secured the long-term preservation of technology-based art.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/blogcategory/6/15/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; IMAI collaborates with restorers, art historians, technicians and artists. The foundation has realized six case studies so far:

The first case study was about ''Il Nuotatore (va troppo spesso ad Heidelberg)''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/39/15/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; a work by [[Studio Azzurro]] from 1984. ''In Situ''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/15/15/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; (1986) by [[Gary Hill]], ''Exchange Fields''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/166/15/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; (2000) by [[Bill Seaman]], ''Testcuts I''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/218/15/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Katharina Sieverding]] (2010), ''Light Composition: Documenta 8''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/219/15/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt; (1987) by [[Nan Hoover]] and ''Zweileinwandkino'' &lt;ref&gt;http://quadriennale-duesseldorf.de/english/programme/the_invisible_force_behind.html Quadriennale program 2014&lt;/ref&gt; (1968/2014) by Lutz Mommartz. The results of the case studies were presented in publications and at several conferences.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/242/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
IMAI participated in the [[Düsseldorf]] art festival Quadriennale 2010 with ''[[Katharina Sieverding]]. Testcuts. Projected Data Images''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.3sat.de/mediathek/?display=1&amp;mode=play&amp;obj=20314 3sat tv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artnet.com/artists/katharina-sieverding/ Katharina Sieverding at Artnet&lt;/ref&gt; and participated in Quadriennale 2014 with the exhibition ''The Invisible Force Behind. Materiality in Media Art''.&lt;ref&gt;http://quadriennale-duesseldorf.de/english/programme/the_invisible_force_behind.html Quadriennale program 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Media artists Holger Mader and Heike Wiermann will display a light-art projection in the Ehrenhof courtyard that will play across the windows of the Belvedere and also at times the fountain area in the inner courtyard of the Museum Kunstpalast. The exhibition ''Images against Darkness (Bilder gegen die Dunkelheit)'' at KIT – Kunst im Tunnel &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kunst-im-tunnel.de/e/archiv/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; presented a selection of video art works from the imai archive for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imaionline.de/content/view/204/6/lang,en/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''incremental learning''' is a method of [[machine learning]], in which input data is continuously used to extend the existing model's knowledge i.e. to further train the model. It represents a dynamic technique of [[supervised learning]] and [[unsupervised learning]] that can be applied when training data becomes available gradually over time or its size is out of system memory limits. Algorithms that can facilitate incremental learning are known as incremental machine learning algorithms.

Many traditional machine learning algorithms inherently support incremental learning, other algorithms can be adapted to facilitate this. Examples of incremental algorithms include

IEEE, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The aim of incremental learning is for the learning model to adapt to new data without forgetting its existing knowledge, it does not retrain the model.  Some incremental learners have built-in some parameter or assumption that controls the relevancy of old data, while others, called stable incremental machine learning algorithms, learn representations of the training data that are not even partially forgotten over time. Fuzzy ART&lt;ref name="Fuzzy ART"&gt;Carpenter, G.A., Grossberg, S., &amp; Rosen, D.B., [http://dcommon.bu.edu/bitstream/handle/2144/2070/91.015.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y Fuzzy ART: Fast stable learning and categorization of analog patterns by an adaptive resonance system], Neural Networks, 4(6): 759-771, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and TopoART&lt;ref name="TopoART" /&gt; are two examples for this second approach.

Incremental algorithms are frequently applied to [[data stream]]s or [[big data]], addressing issues in data availability and resource scarcity respectively. Stock trend prediction and user profiling are some examples of data streams where new data becomes continuously available.  Applying incremental learning to big data aims to produce faster [[statistical classification|classification]] or [[forecasting]] times.

An '''indigenous language''' or '''autochthonous language''' is a [[language]] that is native to a region and spoken by [[indigenous people]]. This language would be from a linguistically distinct [[community]] that has been settled in the area for many generations. Indigenous languages are not necessarily [[national language]]s, and the reverse is also true.

Many indigenous peoples worldwide have [[endangered language|stopped passing on]] their ancestral languages to the next generation, and have instead [[language shift|adopted]] the [[majority language]] as part of their [[acculturation]] into the [[majority culture]]. Furthermore, many indigenous languages have been subject to [[language death|linguicide]] (language killing).&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 55-56 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil‘ad]], Shakuto-Neoh, Shiori &amp; Quer, Giovanni Matteo (2014), [http://www.professorzuckermann.com/#!native-tongue-title/cufd Native Tongue Title: Proposed Compensation for the Loss of Aboriginal Languages], ''Australian Aboriginal Studies'' 2014/1: 55-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing their vulnerability, the [[United Nations]] proclaimed 2019 the International Year of Indigenous Languages, "to draw attention to the critical loss of indigenous languages and the urgent need to preserve, revitalize and promote indigenous languages."&lt;ref&gt;United Nations General Assembly, 71st session, Third Committee, 16 November 2016 [https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/C.3/71/L.17/Rev.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance==
Many indigenous languages are disappearing as there are no longer any young people left to speak those languages, so their remaining speakers are dying out.&lt;ref&gt;Glavin, Maywa and Montenegro, Terry. "''In Defense of Difference''." 7 October 2008. Seed Magazine. 29 January 2009 [http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/10/in_defense_of_difference_1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;
In North America, since 1600 at least 52 [[Native American languages]] have disappeared. Globally, there may be more than 7,000 languages that exist in the world today, though many of them have not been recorded because they belong to tribes in rural areas of the world or are not easily accessible. It is estimated that 6,809 "living" languages exist in the world today, with 90% having fewer than 100,000 speakers. This means that roughly 6,100 languages are facing a risk of eventual extinction. Some languages are very close to disappearing. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Forty six languages are known to have just one native speaker while 357 languages have fewer than 50 speakers. Rare languages are more likely to show evidence of decline than more common ones.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, Steve. "Alarm Raised on World's Disappearing Languages." 15 May 2003. Common Dreams. Org. 21 February 2009 [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/alarm-raised-on-worlds-disappearing-languages-104768.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Oklahoma]] provides the backdrop for an example of language loss in the developed world. It boasts the highest density of indigenous languages in the United States. This includes languages originally spoken in the region, as well as those of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes from other areas that were [[Indian removal|forcibly relocated onto reservations]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "''Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages''." 2009. National Geographic. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government drove the [[Yuchi]] from [[Tennessee]] to Oklahoma in the early 19th century. Until the early 20th century, most Yuchi tribe members spoke the language fluently. Then, government boarding schools severely punished American Indian students who were overheard speaking their own language. To avoid beatings and other punishments, Yuchi, and other Indian children abandoned their native languages in favor of English.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2005, only five elderly members of the Yuchi tribe were fluent in the language. These remaining speakers spoke Yuchi fluently before they went to school and have maintained the language despite strong pressure to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages." 2009. ''National Geographic''. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This situation was not limited to Oklahoma.  In the Northwest Pacific plateau there are no speakers left of the indigenous tribal languages from that area, all the way to [[British Columbia]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Oregon's [[Siletz Reservation|Siletz reservation]], established in 1855, was home to the endangered language [[Tolowa language|Siletz Dee-ni]]. The reservation held members of 27 different Indian bands speaking many languages. In order to communicate, people adopted [[Chinook Jargon]], a [[pidgin]] or hybrid language. Between the use of [[Chinook Jargon]] and the increased presence of English, the number of speakers of indigenous languages dwindled.&lt;ref&gt;Living Tongues Institute for Endangered Languages. "Disappearing Languages - Enduring Voices-Documenting the Planet's Endangered Languages." 2009. ''National Geographic''. 19 February 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708132439/http://www.nationalgeographic.com/mission/enduringvoices/ |archivedate=2010-07-08 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other tribes of Native Americans were also forced into government schools and reservations. They were also treated badly if they did not become "civilized". This meant they were to go to Christian churches and speak English. They were forced to give up their tribal religious beliefs and languages. Now, these Native Americans are trying to regain some of their lost heritage. They gather at "[[Pow-wow]]" to share culture, stories, remedies, dances, music, rhythms, recipes and heritage with anyone who wants to learn them.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In January 2008, in Anchorage, Alaska, friends and relatives gathered to bid their last farewell to 89 year old Marie Smith Jones, a beloved matriarch of her community. "As they bid her farewell to her, they also bid farewell to the [[Eyak language]] as Marie was the last fluent speaker of the language."&lt;ref&gt;Glavin, Maywa and Montenegro, Terry. "In Defense of Difference." 7 October 2008. ''Seed Magazine''. 29 January 2009 2009[http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2008/10/in_defense_of_difference_1.php].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Isle of Man]], following the decline in the use of [[Manx language|Manx]] during the 19th century, {{lang|gv|Yn Cheshaght Ghailckagh}} (The Manx Language Society) was founded in 1899. By the middle of the 20th century only a few elderly [[native speaker]]s remained (the last of them, [[Ned Maddrell]], died on 27 December 1974), but by then a scholarly [[Language revitalization|revival]] had begun to spread and many people had learned Manx as a second language. The revival of Manx has been aided by the recording work done in the 20th century by researchers.

==Learning==
Hundreds of indigenous languages around the world are taught by traditional means, including vocabulary, grammar, readings and recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviews of Language Courses|url=http://lang1234.com|publisher=Lang1234|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 6,000 others can be learned to some extent by listening to recordings made for other purposes, such as religious texts, where translations are available in more widely known languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Countries of the World|url=http://globalrecordings.net/en/countries|publisher=Global Recordings Network|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GEOGRAPHIC LANGUAGE MUSEUM|url=http://foreignlanguageexpertise.com/museum2.html|publisher=ForeignLanguageExpertise.com|accessdate=11 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Treasure language"==
The term "treasure language" was proposed by the [[Rama people]] of Nicaragua as an alternative to [[Heritage language]], Indigenous language and "ethnic language", names that are considered pejorative in the local context.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grinevald |first1=Colette |last2=Pivot |first2= Bénédicte |editor-last1=Jones |editor-first1=Mari |editor-last2=Ogilvie |editor-first2=Sarah |title=Keeping Languages Alive: Documentation, Pedagogy and Revitalization |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2013 |chapter=On the revitalization of a ‘treasure language’: The Rama Language Project of Nicaragua |chapterurl=https://www.academia.edu/5387106/The_Revitalization_of_a_Treasure_Language_the_Rama_Language_Project_of_Nicaragua |doi=10.1017/CBO9781139245890.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now also used in the context of public storytelling events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Languages Treasured but Not Lost  |url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/languages-treasured-but-not-lost/Content?oid=4679610 |work=East Bay Express |location=Oakland |date=2016-02-17 |access-date=2017-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "treasure language" references the desire of speakers to sustain the use of their mother tongue into the future:
{{Quote|text=[The] notion of treasure fit the idea of something that had been buried and almost lost, but was being rediscovered and now shown and shared. And the word treasure also evoked the notion of something belonging exclusively to the Rama people, who now attributed it real value and had become eager and proud of being able to show it to others.&lt;ref name="Grinevald"/&gt;}}

Accordingly, the term may be considered to be distinct from [[Endangered language]] for which objective criteria are available, or [[Heritage language]] which describes an end-state for a language where individuals are more fluent in a dominant language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Hale |editor-first1=Kenneth |editor-last2=Hinton |editor-first2=Leanne |title=The Green Book of Language Revitalization in Practice |publisher=Emerald Group Publishing |date=2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2575">'''Internet traffic engineering''' is defined as that aspect of [[Internet]] network [[engineering]] dealing with the issue of performance evaluation and performance optimization of operational [[IP networks]]. Traffic engineering encompasses the application of technology and scientific principles to the measurement, characterization, modeling, and control of Internet traffic [RFC-2702, AWD2].

Enhancing the performance of an operational [[Computer network|network]], at both traffic and resource levels, are major objectives of Internet engineering. This is accomplished by addressing traffic performance requirements, while utilizing network economically and reliably. Traffic oriented performance includes [[packet transfer delay]], [[packet delay variation]], [[packet loss]], and [[throughput]].

An important objective of Internet traffic engineering is to facilitate reliable network operations [RFC-2702]. This can be done by providing mechanisms that network integrity and by embracing policies emphasizing survivability. This results in a minimization of the network to service outages arising from errors, faults and failures occurring within the infrastructure.

The Internet exists in order to transfer information from nodes to [[destination node]]s.  Accordingly, one of the most crucial functions performed by the Internet is the routing of traffic [[ingress node]]s to [[egress node]]s.

Ultimately, it is the performance of the network as seen by network services that is truly paramount. This crucial function should be considered throughout the development of engineering mechanisms and policies. The characteristics visible to end users are the emergent properties of the network, which are characteristics of the network when viewed as a whole. A goal of the service provider, therefore, is to enhance the properties of the network while taking economic considerations into account.

The importance of the above observation regarding the properties of networks is that special care must be taken when choosing network performance metrics to optimize. Optimizing the wrong metrics may achieve certain local objectives, but may have repercussions elsewhere.

The '''K Foundation''' was an art foundation set up by [[Bill Drummond]] and [[Jimmy Cauty]] ([[The KLF]]) in 1993, following their 'retirement' from the music industry. The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo's post-retirement KLF income. Between 1993 and 1995, they spent this money in a number of ways, including on a series of [[Situationist International|Situationist]]-inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world, focusing in particular on the [[Turner Prize]]. Most notoriously, when their plans to use [[banknotes]] as part of a work of [[art]] fell through, they [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burned a million pounds in cash]].

The K Foundation announced a 23-year [[wiktionary:moratorium|moratorium]] on all projects from November 1995. They further indicated that they would not speak about the burning of the million pounds during the period of this moratorium.

==Context==
In the early 1980s, British musician and artist [[Jimmy Cauty]] was the guitarist in an underachieving pop/rock band, [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]].&lt;ref name="Trouserpress"&gt;[[Ira Robbins|Robbins, I.]], "KLF", ''[[Trouser Press]]'' magazine ([http://trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=klf link]). Retrieved 20 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Brilliant had been signed to [[Warner Music Group|WEA Records]] by [[A&amp;R]] man [[Bill Drummond]],&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy, D., Brilliant biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p22681/biography|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; formerly a member of the Liverpool group [[Big in Japan (band)|Big in Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;"Big in Japan - Where are they now?", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', January 1992 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=271 link])&lt;/ref&gt; the manager of [[The Teardrop Explodes]] and [[Echo &amp; the Bunnymen]],&lt;ref name="TateTat"&gt;"Tate tat and arty", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 20 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359 link])&lt;/ref&gt; and co-founder of the independent record label [[Zoo Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon, ''Rip It Up And Start Again: Post-punk 1978-1984'', {{ISBN|0-571-21570-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Brilliant released their one and only album - ''[[Kiss The Lips Of Life]]'' - before splitting up.&lt;ref&gt;LeRoy, D., ''Kiss the Lips of Life'' review, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r55441|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Drummond left WEA Records to record a solo album.&lt;ref name="SpecialK"&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst out walking on [[New Year's Day]], 1987, Drummond hit upon an idea for a hip-hop record but, he said, knowing "nothing, personally, about the technology", he needed a collaborator. Drummond called Jimmy Cauty who agreed to join him in a new band called [[The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu]] (The JAMs).&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story Of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First BBC broadcast believed to have been in [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP late 1994], and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm 1 January 2005]. Transcript taken from the [http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 KLF FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427020752/http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 |date=27 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The JAMs' debut release, the single "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]", was released as an underground [[white label]] on 9 March 1987.&lt;ref name="discog"&gt;Longmire, Ernie et al. [http://www.klf.de/discography/ KLF discography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111071100/http://www.klf.de/discography/ |date=11 January 2008 }} Compiled by Ernie Longmire, this has been the authoritative KLF discography on the internet for some 10 years or more and has been the subject of long-term scrutiny and peer review by KLF fans and collectors. It is now maintained by the fan site klf.de. Retrieved 19 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, the duo—now calling themselves [[The KLF]]—had become the best-selling singles band in the world and, according to the ''[[Allmusic]]'', were "on the verge of becoming superstars".&lt;ref name="AMG"&gt;Bush, J., KLF biography, ''[[Allmusic]]'' ([{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4694/biography|pure_url=yes}} link])&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, in May 1992 they machine-gunned a music industry audience at the [[BRIT Awards]] (albeit with blanks) and quit the music business.&lt;ref&gt;"[1992] had been the year of Bill's 'breakdown', when The KLF, perched on the peak of greater-than-ever success, quit the music business, (toy) machine gunned the tuxedo'd twats in the front row of that year's BRIT Awards ceremony and dumped a sheep's carcass on the steps at the after-show party." Martin, G., "The Chronicled Mutineers", ''[[Vox (magazine)|Vox]]'', December 1996 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=430 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

By their own account, neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money that they made as The KLF; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions. Cauty told an Australian ''[[Big Issue]]'' writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent, and that the [[royalties]] they accrued post-retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds:{{cquote|I think we made about £6m. We paid nearly half that in [[tax]] and spent the rest on production costs. When we stopped, the production costs stopped too, so over the next few months we amassed a surplus of cash still coming in from record sales; this amounted to about £1.8m. After tax we were left with about £1m.&lt;ref&gt;Butler, B., interview with Jimmy Cauty for ''[[The Big Issue Australia]]'', 18 June 2003 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=538 link])&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Although the duo had deleted their back catalogue in the UK with immediate effect, international licensees retained the contractual right to distribute KLF recordings for a number of years. The KLF, like any other artist, were also entitled to [[Performing Right Society]] royalties every time one of their songs was played on the radio or television. Rather than spend these earnings or invest them for personal gain, the duo decided the money would be used to fund a new art foundation - The K Foundation.&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;Reid, J., "Money to burn", ''[[The Observer]]'', 25 September 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=387 link])&lt;/ref&gt;  "Having created an artistic machine that created money", said ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' Magazine, "they [then] invented a machine for destroying it."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, W., "Special K", ''[[GQ (magazine)|GQ]]'' Magazine, April 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=397 link])&lt;/ref&gt; Quite what the Foundation, this money-destroying machine, would do with the million pounds plus was still undecided.

Music journalist [[Sarah Champion (journalist)|Sarah Champion]] pointed out (prior to the million pound fire) that, "Being 'in the money' doesn't mean they'll ever be rich. [Drummond and Cauty will] always be [[wiktionary:skint|skint]], but their pranks will get more extravagant. If they earned £10 million, they'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation [[airship]]s or a [[Van Gogh]] to be ceremonially burned."&lt;ref name="Trash"&gt;Sharkey, A., "Trash Art &amp; Kreation", ''[[The Guardian|The Guardian Weekend]]'', 21 May 1994&lt;/ref&gt; "There are things we'd like to do which we haven't done.", Drummond told a journalist in 1991. "Totally ludicrous things. We want to buy ships, have submarines. They really are stupid things I know, but I feel confident that in the event of us selling ten million albums we would definitely go out and buy a submarine....Just to be able to say 'Look we've got a submarine and [[808 State]] haven't'."&lt;ref&gt;Morton, R., "One Coronation Under A Groove", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 22 January 1991 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=191 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==K Foundation adverts==
The first manifestation of the K Foundation was a series of adverts in UK national newspapers in 1993. The first adverts, in July 1993, were cryptic, referring to "K Time" and advising readers to "Kick out the clocks".&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Divide &amp; Kreate"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 3 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=330 link]) and ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 3 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=329 link])&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an advert for their single "K Cera Cera" which was "Available nowhere ... no formats" and which was not planned for release until world peace was established. The single was eventually released, but only in Israel.&lt;ref name="KCera"&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("K Cera Cera"), ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 10 July 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=332 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

"When the first in a strange series of full-page ads appeared in The Independent on July 4", said ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', "people started whispering. The cultish rhetoric, the unfathomable "Divide and Kreate" slogans, the K symbols, all suggested that the kings of cultural anarchy were back."&lt;ref name="Face"&gt;"K Foundation: Nailed To The Wall", ''[[The Face (magazine)|The Face]]'', January 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=374 link])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The kings of cultural anarchy" refers, of course, to [[The KLF]].&lt;/ref&gt; Each advert cost between £5,000 and £15,000.&lt;ref name="Times-ads"&gt;Sandall, Robert, "Adding to the confusion; K Foundation's new ads", ''[[The Times]]'' ([[London]]) ISSN 0140-0460 , 12 September 1993, Features section.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turner Prize subversion==
{{main|K Foundation art award}}

The [[K Foundation art award|1994 K Foundation award]] was an award given by the K Foundation to the "worst artist of the year".
The Foundation commissioned more press adverts, instructing readers to "Abandon all art now"&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Abandon All Art Now"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 14 August 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=339 link])&lt;/ref&gt; and then inviting them to vote for the worst artist of the year.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Let The People Choose"), ''[[The Guardian|Guardian Weekend]]'', 18 September 1993 and ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'', 19 September 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The 1993 [[Turner Prize]] was being judged at the same time, and, perhaps not coincidentally, both awards had the same shortlist of four artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ezard, J., "Worst art hoaxers' scam goes kaput", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 August 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=342 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The prize being offered by Drummond and Cauty was £40,000 which was double the £20,000 offered for the Turner Prize.&lt;ref name="KellyQ"&gt;[[Danny Kelly (journalist)|Kelly, D.]], "Million Dollar Bash", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', February 1994, ''passim'' ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=377 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Channel 4]] Television broadcast coverage of the Turner Prize, during which three more K Foundation adverts were broadcast &amp;mdash; these announced the "amending of art history".&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation television advertisements, [[Channel 4]], 23 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=516 link])&lt;/ref&gt; During the evening, [[Rachel Whiteread]] was announced as the winner of both the Turner Prize and the K Foundation award. Whiteread initially refused to accept the K Foundation prize, but after being told that the money would be incinerated, she reluctantly accepted, with the intention of donating £30,000 to artists in financial need and the other £10,000 to the housing charity, [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]].&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;"The Best Of Artists, The Worst of Artists", ''[[New York Times]]'', 29 November 1993([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=366 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;ref name="Face"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This was announced in an advertisement placed by Whiteread in ''[[Art Monthly]]'', January 1994. See [[:Image:Rachel Whiteread's K Foundation award advert.jpg]] for a scan.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Money: A Major Body of Cash''==
During the buildup to the presentation of the K Foundation art award to Rachel Whiteread on 23 November 1993, the K Foundation presented their first artwork to the press. ''Nailed To A Wall'', "the first of a series of K Foundation art installations that will also include one million pounds in a skip, one million pounds on a table and several variants on the theme of Tremendous Amounts Of Folding", consisted of one million pounds in £50 notes, nailed to a large framed board.&lt;ref name="KellyQ"/&gt; ''Nailed To A Wall'' had a reserve price of £500,000, half the face value of the cash used in its construction, which ''Scotland on Sunday'''s reporter Robert Dawson Scott was "fairly confident... really was £1 million [in cash]". The catalogue entry for the artwork stated: "Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation, while the artistic value will rise and rise. The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown. Deconstruct the work now and you double your money. Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode, the market value fluctuate, and the artistic value soar. The choice is yours."&lt;ref name="DawsonScott"&gt;Dawson Scott, Robert, "K Foundation tries to turn the art world on its head", ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', 28 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=364 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

Collectively, the K Foundation's money-as-art works were titled ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash'', "seven pieces, all involving various amounts of cash nailed to, tied to or simply standing on inanimate objects".&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; ''The Face'' magazine neatly summed up the concepts behind the art project:{{cquote|If there is any overriding theme to all this unfathomable rhetoric, it's that money has become the root of all art. The questions posed in the K Foundation's first catalogue all hint at this idea: "How beautiful is money?" "Why do we try and make money measure the immeasurable?" "Have you ever [[wiktionary:shag#Etymology 3|shagged]] somebody who works in a bank?" In short, "What is money?"

To add further weight to this theory, they also pull off a neat conceptual punchline. Their art is made out of cash. The face value of that cash is obvious. The artistic value, until somebody buys it and gives it artistic status, is zero. The K Foundation have put a price on these works precisely halfway between their current monetary value and their artistic value. The joke being that if you were to buy the piece called 10,000 (four piles of mint fifties nailed to a plank of salvaged skirting board) for the asking price of 5,000 (ono), you stand to pocket five grand if you destroy the art and spend the money. Alternatively, hang it on your wall and see the cash value eroded by inflation while the artistic value soars. It's the sale of the century!&lt;ref name="Face"/&gt;}}

During the first half of 1994, the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging ''Money: A Major Body Of Cash''. However, even old friend [[Jayne Casey]], director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. "'The [[Tate Liverpool|Tate, in Liverpool]], wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly",&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former [[Soviet Union]] by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. Then an exhibition at [[Dublin]]'s [[Kilmainham Jail]] was considered. No sooner had a provisional date of August been set for the exhibition, however, when the duo changed their minds yet again. "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do."&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; Cauty: "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare."&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"&gt;"We didn't set out to make a film, we set out to burn 1m", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 September 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=463 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The K Foundation Burn a Million Quid''==
{{Main|K Foundation Burn a Million Quid}}
On 23 August 1994, in a boathouse on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]], Drummond and Cauty incinerated £1,000,000 in cash.&lt;ref&gt;"One million [[wiktionary:quid|Quid]]" in [[British slang]]&lt;/ref&gt; The burning was witnessed by an old friend of Drummond's, freelance journalist Jim Reid, who subsequently wrote an article about the ceremony for ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref name="Reid"/&gt; It was filmed on [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] by their friend [[Alan Goodrick|Gimpo]].

Reid admitted to first feeling shock and guilt about the burning, which quickly turned to boredom. The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. Drummond later said that only about £900,000 of the money was actually burnt &amp;ndash; the rest flew straight up the chimney.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, D., "It's not haute cuisine", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 20 May 2004 ([https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1220512,00.html link])&lt;/ref&gt;  The press reported that an islander handed £1,500 into the police; the money had not been claimed and would be returned to the finder.&lt;ref&gt;Bowditch, G., "Duo with £1m to burn leave island guessing", ''[[The Times]]'', 4 October 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=389 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKerron, I., "Duo Burn £1M In Midnight Madness", ''[[Daily Express]]'', 1 October 1994 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=388 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 August 1995, exactly one year after the burning, Drummond and Cauty returned to Jura for the premier screening of the film,&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy, "From cash to ash", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 30 August 1995, page T.009&lt;/ref&gt; now known as ''[[Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]''. The film was then toured around the UK over the next few months (plus one showing in [[Belgrade]]), with a Q&amp;A session at the end of each screening where members of the audience asked Drummond and Cauty why they burnt the money and also offered their own interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: [[John Harris (critic)|Harris, John]], "Who wants to be a millionaire?", ''[[Q Magazine]]'', November 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=400 link])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moratorium==
Drummond and Cauty announced a [[wiktionary:moratorium|moratorium]] on K Foundation activities in the obscure "[[The Workshop for Non-linear Architecture]]" bulletin of November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stewart Home|Home, Stewart]], "There's no success like failure", ''[[Variant magazine|Variant]]'', Volume 2 Number 1 (Winter 1996), p18 ([http://www.variant.randomstate.org/pdfs/issue1/success.pdf#search=%22%22k%20foundation%22%20moratorium%22 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The duo had signed a "[[contract]]", agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years. The document was signed on the [[hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] of a rented car which, they claim, they then pushed over the cliffs at [[Cape Wrath]]. This was followed on 8 December 1995 by an advertisement in ''[[The Guardian]]'':{{cquote|On 5 November 1995, Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond signed a contract with the rest of the world agreeing to end the K Foundation for a period of 23 years.

This postponement provides opportunity of sufficient length for an accurate and appropriately executed response to their 'burning of a million quid'. The K Foundation's fate now lies irrevocably sealed in the imploded remains of a [[Nissan Bluebird]] nestling among the rocks 600 feet below Cape Wrath, Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;K Foundation advertisement ("Cape Wrath"), ''[[The Guardian]] (G2)'', 8 December 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that they have spoken about the burning since then to a limited extent (references can be found in [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]], including quotations from Drummond where he expresses regret at burning the money); the "contract" has not been as strictly followed as The KLF's stated intention to delete their back catalogue in 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In November 1995, the BBC aired an edition of the ''[[Omnibus (BBC)|Omnibus]]'' documentary series about The K Foundation entitled "A Foundation Course in Art".&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by Sutcliffe, Thomas, ''[[The Independent]]'' ([[London]]) ISSN 0951-9467 , 7 November 1995, TV section p24.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final act of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of [[Tennent's Super]] - a high-alcohol-content lager - to London's [[drinking in public|street drinkers]] on [[Christmas Day]] 1995. &lt;!-- Recalling The JAMs' 1987 single, ''[[Down Town]]'', this was the second occasion in which Cauty and Drummond juxtaposed the spirit of Christmas with the plight of the urban alcoholic homeless. : Maybe, but we need a source to make the connection --&gt; However, the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]] on the [[South Bank]] — was unusually devoid of homeless people, many of whom were in homeless shelters for the day. "That was a pity", said Jimmy Cauty. "If you are down-and-out, would you rather have a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent's?"&lt;ref&gt;"English charity gives out beer to London's ranks of homeless", ''[[San Jose Mercury]]'', 26 December 1995 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=412 link])&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Sunday Times'' later called the scheme "ethically dubious".&lt;ref&gt;Heaney, Mick, "Bill Drummond once burnt Pounds 1m for art's sake. Now he is taking a soupopera to Belfast", ''[[Sunday Times]]'' ([[London]]), 18 April 2004, p18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty would next work together in 1997, when they attempted to "[[Fuck the Millennium]]" as [[2K (band)|2K]] (music) and [[K2 Plant Hire]] (conceptual art).

==K Cera Cera and The Magnificent==
The only music release to bear the name of the K Foundation was "[[K Cera Cera]]", released as a limited edition single in Israel and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in November 1993. An amalgam of "[[Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)]]" and [[John Lennon]]/[[Yoko Ono]]'s "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]", it was credited to the "K Foundation presents The [[MVD Ensemble|Red Army Choir]]". Originally intended for release when "world peace [is] established" (i.e. never) and in "no formats",&lt;ref name="KCera"/&gt; the Israeli release was made "In acknowledgement of the recent brave steps taken by the Israeli Government and the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation]] (PLO)".&lt;ref&gt;K Cera Cera sleevenotes&lt;/ref&gt; Said Drummond: "Our idea was to create awareness of peace in the world. Because we were worried it would be interpreted by the public as an attempt by The KLF to return to the music world on the back of a humanist gimmick, we decided to hide behind the Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;"Yasser, they can boogie!", ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 13 November 1993 ([http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=356 link]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also made by the duo during the K Foundation's existence, reported by the ''NME'' as a K Foundation work, but officially attributed to "The [[One World Orchestra]] featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards", was "[[The Magnificent (song)|The Magnificent]]", their contribution to the charity album ''[[The Help Album|Help]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Discogs.com entry for "One World Orchestra, The" ([http://www.discogs.com/artist/One+World+Orchestra,+The discogs.com link])&lt;/ref&gt; The song, a [[drum'n'bass]] version of the theme tune from ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' with vocal samples from [[Fleka|DJ Fleka]] of Serbian radio station [[B92]], was recorded on 4 September 1995. On 5 September 1995, Drummond and Cauty claimed they would "never make any more records". Drummond said,  "What do you expect us to do, go and make a jungle record?"; Cauty added "Yeah, like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something. It would just be sad wouldn't it? We're too old." ''NME'' gleefully informed their readers, "The K Foundation's contribution to the 'Help' LP is a jungle track."&lt;ref name="NMEScreening"/&gt; ''Help'' was released on 9 September 1995.

'''''Li Europan lingues''''' is a quotation in [[Occidental language|Occidental]], an [[international auxiliary language]] devised by [[Edgar von Wahl]] in 
1922. It is used in some [[HTML]] [[Web template|template]]s as a fill-in or [[Filler text|placeholder]] text.  

One of the most common placeholder texts is [[lorem ipsum]]. A similar text of this type is the [[pangram]] ''[[The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog]]'', which is often used in fill-in text and to demonstrate and compare [[typeface]]s because it contains all 26 letters of the [[Latin alphabet]].

==Text==

When used as placeholder text, ''Li Europan lingues'' is usually one or two paragraphs and reads as follows:

:''Li Europan lingues es membres del sam familie. Lor separat existentie es un myth. Por scientie, musica, sport etc, litot Europa usa li sam vocabular. Li lingues differe solmen in li grammatica, li pronunciation e li plu commun vocabules. Omnicos directe al desirabilite de un nov lingua franca: On refusa continuar payar custosi traductores.''

:''At solmen va esser necessi far uniform grammatica, pronunciation e plu commun paroles. Ma quande lingues coalesce, li grammatica del resultant lingue es plu simplic e regulari quam ti del coalescent lingues. Li nov lingua franca va esser plu simplic e regulari quam li existent Europan lingues. It va esser tam simplic quam Occidental in fact, it va esser Occidental. A un Angleso it va semblar un simplificat Angles, quam un skeptic Cambridge amico dit me que Occidental es.''

;English translation:

:''The European languages are members of the same family. Their separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators.''

:''To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words. If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge friend of mine told me that Occidental is.''

==History and discovery of ''Li Europan lingues'' text==

The text of ''Li Europan lingues'' is found in many HTML templates and through copying and uploading of templates this phrase seems to have found its use in many websites.

[[Don Harlow]] posted a message to the Auxlang List on 5 August 2006, mentioning its appearance in the "[[CSS Cookbook]]" from [[O'Reilly]] by [[Christopher Schmitt]], and in templates of webpages which implement [[CSS]]. [http://listserv.brown.edu/archives/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0608a&amp;L=auxlang&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=7343]

[[Don Gasper]] posted another message to the same list suggesting a possible source:
:I have a theory, but it is only a theory. The Interlinguist/Occidentalist Ilmari Federn, who later adopted the name [[Charles Sprague (linguist)|Charles Sprague]] and came to live in England in the late 1930s, worked at the "[[Financial Times]]" in London. I think in the newspaper press. It is possible that he added the text in Interlingue to the standard Lorem ipsum passage. Unfortunately, I never asked him about this when I got to know him in the latter years of his life, in the early 1990s.

William Patterson was pleasantly surprised that evening to read about the appearance of [http://www.kafejo.com/misc/lorem.htm his version] of ''Lorem ipsum'' in the "CSS Cookbook" and quickly confessed. In June 1998, at a time when he was dabbling in Occidental, he had come across the ''Lorem ipsum'' text somewhere and learned about its use as a template. As was his wont when learning something new like that, he created a webpage about it. But while warning about the existence of "corrupt" versions, he offered one himself which included some Occidental text, a dash of [[Esperanto]], some variations of his given name, and a little bit of nonsense. In September 2002 he came across a copy of his version on the Web. Curious, he searched for other instances, and found that on 10 September 2002, an [[AllTheWeb]] search for the strings "ulliam" and "willum" returned 513 hits; by 10 December 2002, 962; and by 14 October 2003, 2337. (One page which he found particularly amusing was a Swedish translation of his own webpage&amp;mdash; Occidental, commentary, page colors, page title ''"Ailanto : Lorem ipsum"'' and all!) And now it's in the "CSS Cookbook"!

An HTML comment in the page that started it all attributes the Occidental text itself to [[S. W. Beer]].

The [[cosmic microwave background]] (CMB) is the thermal radiation assumed to be left over from the "[[Big Bang]]" of [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]].  The CMB is a snapshot of the oldest light in our universe, imprinted on the sky when the universe was just 380,000 years old. It shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities, representing the seeds of all future structure: the stars and galaxies of today. Therefore, analysis of the small anisotropies in the CMB helps us to understand the origin and the fate of our universe. In past few decades, there has been a lot of improvement in the observations and several experiments, performed to understand the basic structure of the universe. For analyzing data of different cosmological experiments and for understanding the theoretical nature of the universe many advanced methods and computing software are developed in and used by Cosmologists for years. These software are widely used by the cosmologists across the globe.

The computational software, used in cosmology can be classified into the following major classes.

* '''Map generation and processing software:''' These software are used for preparing the CMB sky maps from the crude observational data.

== Map generation and processing software ==

=== HEALPix ===

[[HEALPix]] (sometimes written as Healpix), an acronym for Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelisation of a 2-sphere, can refer to either an algorithm for pixelization of the 2-sphere, an associated software package, or an associated class of map projections.  Healpix is widely used for cosmological random map generation. The original motivation for devising HEALPix was one of necessity. [[NASA]]'s [[WMAP]] and the [[European Space Agency]]’s mission [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] - produce multi-frequency data sets sufficient for the construction of full-sky maps of the microwave sky at an angular resolution of a few arc minutes. The principal requirements in the development of HEALPix were to create a mathematical structure that supports a suitable discretization of functions on a sphere at sufficiently high resolution, and to facilitate fast and accurate statistical and astrophysical analysis of massive full-sky data sets.  The HEALPix maps are used in almost all the data processing research in cosmology.

== Cosmological Boltzmann codes ==

=== CMBFAST ===

[[CMBFAST]] is a computer code, developed by [[Uroš Seljak]] and [[Matias Zaldarriaga]] (based on a Boltzmann code written by Edmund Bertschinger, [[Chung-Pei Ma]] and Paul Bode) for computing the power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background anisotropy. It is the first efficient program to do so, reducing the time taken to compute the anisotropy from several days to a few minutes by using a novel semi-analytic line-of-sight approach.

=== CAMB ===

Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background by Antony Lewis and Anthony Challinor. The code was originally based on CMBFAST. Later several developments are made to make it a faster and more accurate and compatible with the present research. The code is written in an object oriented manner to make it more user friendly.

=== CMBEASY ===

CMBEASY is a software package written by Michael Doran, Georg Robbers and Christian M. Müller. The code is based on the CMBFAST package. CMBEASY is fully object oriented C++. This considerably simplifies manipulations and extensions of the CMBFAST code. In addition, a powerful Spline class can be used to easily store and visualize data. Many features of the CMBEASY package are also accessible via a graphical user interface. This may be helpful for gaining intuition, as well as for instruction purposes.

=== CLASS ===

CLASS is a new Boltzmann code developed in this line. The purpose of CLASS is to simulate the evolution of linear perturbations in the universe and to compute CMB and large scale structure observables. Its name also comes from the fact that it is written in object-oriented style mimicking the notion of class. Classes are a programming feature available, e.g., in C++ and python, but these languages are known to be less vectorizable/parallelizable than plain C (or Fortran), and hence potentially slower. CLASS is written in plain C for high performances, while organizing the code in a few modules that reproduce the architecture and philosophy of C++ classes, for optimal readability and modularity.

== Parameter estimation packages ==

[[File:Snapshot3-2-.png|thumbnail|right|A snapshot of AnalyzeThis (CMBEASY) GUI package. The plot shows the marginalize probability distribution from a MCMC chain.]]

=== AnalizeThis ===

AnalizeThis is a parameter estimation package used by cosmologists. It comes with the CMBEASY package. The code is written in C++ and uses the global metropolis Algorithm for estimation of cosmological parameters. The code was developed by Michael Doran, for parameter estimation using WMAP-5 likelihood. However, the code was not updated after 2008 for the new CMB experiments. Hence this package is currently not in use by the CMB research community. The package comes up with a nice GUI.

=== CosmoMC ===

CosmoMC is a Fortran 2003 [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] (MCMC) engine for exploring cosmological parameter space. The code does brute force (but accurate) theoretical [[matter power spectrum]] and [[Cosmic microwave background|Cl]] calculations using CAMB. CosmoMC uses a simple local Metropolis algorithm along with an optimized fast-slow sampling method. This fast-slow sampling method provides faster convergence for the cases with many nuisance parameters like Planck. CosmoMC package also provides subroutines for post processing and plotting of the data.

CosmoMC was written by Antony Lewis in 2002 and later several versions are developed to keep the code up-to date with different cosmological experiments. It is presently the most used cosmological parameter estimation code.

=== SCoPE ===

SCoPE/Slick Cosmological Parameter Estimator is a newly developed cosmological MCMC package written by Santanu Das in C language. Apart of standard global metropolis algorithm the code uses three unique technique named as 'delayed rejection' that increases the acceptance rate of a chain, 'pre-fetching' that helps an individual chain to run on parallel CPUs and 'inter-chain covariance update' that prevents clustering of the chains allowing faster and better mixing of the chains. The code is capable of faster computation of cosmological parameters from WMAP and Planck data.

== Other packages ==
* [http://cds.cern.ch/record/408710/files/9911389.pdf MADCAP] - Microwave Anisotropy Data Computational Analysis Package developed by Borrill et al.
* [https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~sasselov/rec/ RECFAST] - Software was developed by Seager, Sasselov, and Scott and used to calculate the recombination history of the universe. The package is used by cosmological boltzmann codes (CMBFast, CAMB etc.)

=== Likelihood software packages ===

Different cosmology experiments, in particular the CMB experiments like [[WMAP]] and [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck]] measures the temperature fluctuations in the CMB sky and then measure the CMB power spectrum from the observed skymap. But for parameter estimation the χ² is required. Therefore, all these CMB experiments comes up with its own likelihood software.

'''Logical consequence''' (also '''entailment''') is a fundamental [[concept]] in [[logic]], which describes the relationship between [[statement (logic)|statement]]s that hold true when one statement logically ''follows from'' one or more statements. A [[Validity (logic)|valid]] logical [[argument]] is one in which the [[Consequent|conclusion]] is entailed by the [[premise]]s, because the conclusion is the consequence of the premises. The [[philosophical analysis]] of logical consequence involves the questions: In what sense does a conclusion follow from its premises?  and What does it mean for a conclusion to be a consequence of premises?&lt;ref name="sep" &gt;Beall, JC and Restall, Greg, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/logical-consequence/ Logical Consequence]'' The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;  All of [[philosophical logic]] is meant to provide accounts of the nature of logical consequence and the nature of [[logical truth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine, Willard Van Orman]], ''Philosophy of Logic''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical consequence is [[logical truth|necessary]] and [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|formal]], by way of examples that explain with [[formal proof]] and [[interpretation (logic)|models of interpretation]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; A sentence is said to be a logical consequence of a set of sentences, for a given [[Formal language|language]], [[if and only if]], using only logic (i.e. without regard to any ''personal'' interpretations of the sentences) the sentence must be true if every sentence in the set is true.&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;[[Matthew W. McKeon|McKeon, Matthew]], ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/logcon/ Logical Consequence]'' Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Logicians make precise accounts of logical consequence regarding a given [[formal language|language]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;, either by constructing a [[deductive system]] for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; or by formal [[Intended interpretation|intended semantics]] for language &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.  The Polish logician [[Alfred Tarski]] identified three features of an adequate characterization of entailment: (1) The logical consequence relation relies on the [[logical form]] of the sentences, (2) The relation is [[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]], i.e. it can be determined with or without regard to [[empirical evidence]] (sense experience), and (3) The logical consequence relation has a [[modal logic|modal]] component.&lt;ref name="iep" /&gt;

== Formal accounts ==
The most widely prevailing view on how to best account for logical consequence is to appeal to formality. This is to say that whether statements follow from one another logically depends on the structure or [[logical form]] of the statements without regard to the contents of that form.

Syntactic accounts of logical consequence rely on [[schema (logic)|schemes]] using [[inference rule]]s. For instance, we can express the logical form of a valid argument as:

: All ''X'' are ''Y''
: All ''Y'' are ''Z''
: Therefore, all ''X'' are ''Z''.

This argument is formally valid, because every [[Substitution (logic)|instance]] of arguments constructed using this scheme is valid.

This is in contrast to an argument like "Fred is Mike's brother's son. Therefore Fred is Mike's nephew." Since this argument depends on the meanings of the words "brother", "son", and "nephew", the statement "Fred is Mike's nephew" is a so-called [[material conditional|material consequence]] of "Fred is Mike's brother's son," not a formal consequence. A formal consequence must be true ''in all cases'', however this is an incomplete definition of formal consequence, since even the argument "''P'' is ''Q'''s brother's son, therefore ''P'' is ''Q'''s nephew" is valid in all cases, but is not a ''formal'' argument.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== A priori property of logical consequence ==

If you know that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; follows logically from &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; no information about the possible interpretations of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; will affect that knowledge. Our knowledge that &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is a logical consequence of &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; cannot be influenced by [[A priori and a posteriori|empirical knowledge]].&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; Deductively valid arguments can be known to be so without recourse to experience, so they must be knowable a priori.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt; However, formality alone does not guarantee that logical consequence is not influenced by empirical knowledge. So the a priori property of logical consequence is considered to be independent of formality.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;

== Proofs and models ==
The two prevailing techniques for providing accounts of logical consequence involve expressing the concept in terms of ''proofs'' and via ''models''. The study of the syntactic consequence (of a logic) is called (its) [[proof theory]] whereas the study of (its) semantic consequence is called (its) [[model theory]].&lt;ref name="ChiaraDoets1996"&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Maria Luisa Dalla Chiara |editor2=Kees Doets |editor3=Daniele Mundici |editor4=Johan van Benthem |title=Logic and Scientific Methods: Volume One of the Tenth International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science, Florence, August 1995|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TCthvF8xLIAC&amp;pg=PA292|year=1996|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4383-7|page=292|chapter=Logical consequence: a turn in style|author=Kosta Dosen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Syntactic consequence ===
{{See also|Therefore_sign|label 1= ∴|Turnstile_(symbol)|label 2= ⊢}}

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \vdash_{\mathcal {FS} } A&lt;/math&gt;

Syntactic consequence does not depend on any [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the formal system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Hunter (logician)|Hunter, Geoffrey]], Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971, p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Semantic consequence ===
{{See also|Double turnstile|label 1= ⊨}}

A formula &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a '''semantic consequence''' within some formal system &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{FS}&lt;/math&gt; of a set of statements &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma \models_{\mathcal {FS} } A,&lt;/math&gt;

if and only if there is no model &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{I}&lt;/math&gt; in which all members of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are true and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is false.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Etchemendy|Etchemendy, John]], ''Logical consequence'',  The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;  Or, in other words, the set of the interpretations that make all members of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; true is a subset of the set of the interpretations that make &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; true.

== Modal accounts ==

[[Modal logic|Modal]] accounts of logical consequence are variations on the following basic idea:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if it is ''necessary'' that if all of the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are true, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true.

Alternatively (and, most would say, equivalently):

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if it is ''impossible'' for all of the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; to be true and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; false.

Such accounts are called "modal" because they appeal to the modal notions of [[Logical truth|logical necessity]]  and  [[logical possibility]]. 'It is necessary that' is often expressed as a [[universal quantification|universal quantifier]] over [[possible world]]s, so that the accounts above translate as:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is true if and only if there is no possible world at which all of the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; are true and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is false (untrue).

Consider the modal account in terms of the argument given as an example above:

:All frogs are green.
:Kermit is a frog.
:Therefore, Kermit is green.

The conclusion is a logical consequence of the premises because we can't imagine a possible world where (a) all frogs are green; (b) Kermit is a frog; and (c) Kermit is not green.

=== Modal-formal accounts ===

Modal-formal accounts of logical consequence combine the modal and formal accounts above, yielding variations on the following basic idea:

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is impossible for an argument with the same logical form as &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;/&lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to have true premises and a false conclusion.

=== Warrant-based accounts ===

The accounts considered above are all "truth-preservational," in that they all assume that the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from true premises to an untrue conclusion. As an alternative, some have proposed "[[Theory of justification|warrant]]-preservational" accounts, according to which the characteristic feature of a good inference is that it never allows one to move from justifiably assertible premises to a conclusion that is not justifiably assertible. This is (roughly) the account favored by [[intuitionist]]s such as [[Michael Dummett]].

=== Non-monotonic logical consequence ===
{{main|Non-monotonic logic}}

The accounts discussed above all yield [[Monotonicity of entailment|monotonic]] consequence relations, i.e. ones such that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a consequence of any superset of &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt;. It is also possible to specify non-monotonic consequence relations to capture the idea that, e.g., 'Tweety can fly' is a logical consequence of

:{Birds can typically fly, Tweety is a bird}

but not of

:{Birds can typically fly, Tweety is a bird, Tweety is a penguin}.

[[Image:HoodedClaw.JPG|thumb|right|A Masked Mystery Villain - ''[[The Hooded Claw]]'' from ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'']]

A '''Masked Mystery Villain''' is a [[stock character]] in [[genre fiction]]. The Masked Mystery Villain was frequently used in the [[adventure]] [[narrative|stories]] of [[Pulp magazines]] and [[Serial (film)|Movie Serials]] in the early twentieth century. They can also appear in [[Crime fiction]] to add to the atmosphere of [[suspense]] and [[suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]]. The "Mask" need not be literal (although it often is), referring more to the subterfuge involved.

He or she is the often main [[antagonist]] of the [[narrative|story]], often acting behind the scenes with [[Henchman|henchmen]] confronting the [[protagonist]]s directly. Usually, the protagonists must discover the [[villain]]'s true identity before they can be defeated. Often the Masked Mystery Villain will turn out to be either one of the protagonists themselves or a significant member of the supporting cast. The [[author]] may give the [[Audience|viewer]] or [[Audience|reader]] clues, with many [[red herring (idiom)|red herrings]], as to the [[villain]]'s identity - sometime as the [[Fictional character|characters]] find them and sometimes for the [[audience]] alone. However, the identity is not usually revealed to the [[audience]] before it is revealed to the [[character (arts)|characters]] of the story. Even the [[villain]]'s [[Henchman|henchmen]] rarely know the truth about their master.

The concept was reversed in the serials ''"[[The Lone Ranger]]"'' and ''"[[The Masked Marvel]]"'', where the true identity of the hero is unknown and a number of characters remain possible candidates until the end.

The archetype tends to be a popular one to be parodied, often using a literal mask and breaking into a stereotypical [[evil laugh]].

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''matrix ring''' is any collection of [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] over some ring ''R'' that form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]] {{harv|Lam|1999}}. The set of {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with entries from ''R'' is a matrix ring denoted M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), as well as some subsets of infinite matrices which form '''infinite matrix rings'''. Any subring of a matrix ring is a matrix ring.

When ''R'' is a commutative ring, the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is an [[associative algebra]], and may be called a '''matrix algebra'''.  For this case, if ''M'' is a matrix and ''r'' is in ''R'', then the matrix ''Mr'' is the matrix ''M'' with each of its entries multiplied by ''r''.

This article assumes that ''R'' is an [[associative ring]] with a unit {{nowrap|1 ≠ 0}}, although matrix rings can be formed over rings without unity.

== Examples ==
* The set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices over an arbitrary ring ''R'', denoted M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').  This is usually referred to as the "full ring of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices".  These matrices represent endomorphisms of the free module ''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.
* The set of all upper (or set of all lower) [[triangular matrices]] over a ring.
* If ''R'' is any ring with unity, then the ring of endomorphisms of &lt;math&gt;M=\bigoplus_{i\in I}R&lt;/math&gt; as a right ''R''-module is isomorphic to the ring of '''column finite matrices''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CFM}_I(R)\,&lt;/math&gt; whose entries are indexed by {{nowrap|''I'' × ''I''}}, and whose columns each contain only finitely many nonzero entries.  The endomorphisms of ''M'' considered as a left ''R'' module result in an analogous object, the '''row finite matrices''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RFM}_I(R)&lt;/math&gt; whose rows each only have finitely many nonzero entries.
* If ''R'' is a [[Banach algebra]], then the condition of row or column finiteness in the previous point can be relaxed.  With the norm in place, [[absolutely convergent series]] can be used instead of finite sums.  For example, the matrices whose column sums are absolutely convergent sequences form a ring.  Analogously of course, the matrices whose row sums are absolutely convergent series also form a ring.  This idea can be used to represent [[Hilbert space#Operators on Hilbert spaces|operators on Hilbert spaces]], for example.
* The intersection of the row and column finite matrix rings also forms a ring, which can be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RCFM}_I(R)&lt;/math&gt;.
* The algebra M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;('''R''') of [[2 × 2 real matrices]], which is [[ring isomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[split-quaternion]]s, is a simple example of a non-commutative associative algebra. Like the [[quaternion]]s, it has [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]] 4 over '''R''', but unlike the quaternions, it has [[zero divisor]]s, as can be seen from the following product of the [[matrix unit]]s: {{nowrap|1=''E''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;''E''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}, hence it is not a [[division ring]]. Its invertible elements are [[nonsingular matrix|nonsingular matrices]] and they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]], the [[general linear group]] {{nowrap|GL(2, '''R''')}}.
*If ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]], the matrix ring has a structure of a [[*-algebra]] over ''R'', where the [[involution (mathematics)#Ring theory|involution]] * on M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is the [[matrix transpose|matrix transposition]]. 
*If ''A'' is a [[C*-algebra]], then M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') consists of ''n''-by-''n'' matrices with entries from the C*-algebra ''A'', which is itself a C*-algebra. If ''A'' is non-unital, then M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') is also non-unital. Viewing ''A'' as a norm-closed subalgebra of the continuous operators ''B''(''H'') for some Hilbert space ''H'' (that there exists such a Hilbert space and isometric *-isomorphism is the content of the [[Gelfand-Naimark theorem]]), we can identify M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') with a subalgebra of ''B''(''H''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\oplus n&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;). For simplicity, if we further suppose that ''H'' is separable and ''A'' &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; ''B''(''H'') is a unital C*-algebra, we can break up ''A'' into a matrix ring over a smaller C*-algebra. One can do so by fixing a [[Projection_(linear_algebra)#Orthogonal_projections|projection]] ''p'' and hence its orthogonal projection 1 - ''p''; one can identify ''A'' with &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} pAp &amp; pA(1-p) \\ (1-p)Ap &amp; (1-p)A(1-p) \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;, where matrix multiplication works as intended because of the orthogonality of the projections. In order to identify ''A'' with a matrix ring over a C*-algebra, we require that ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' have the same ″rank″; more precisely, we need that ''p'' and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' are Murray–von Neumann equivalent, i.e. there exists a [[partial isometry]] ''u'' such that ''p'' = ''uu''* and 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p'' = ''u''*''u''. One can easily generalize this to matrices of larger sizes.
* Complex matrix algebras M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') are, up to isomorphism, the only simple associative algebras over the field '''C''' of [[complex number]]s. For {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 2}}, the matrix algebra M&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') plays an important role in the theory of [[angular momentum]]. It has an alternative basis given by the [[identity matrix]] and the three [[Pauli matrices]]. ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''2''&lt;/sub&gt;('''C''') was the scene of early abstract algebra in the form of [[biquaternion]]s.
* A matrix ring over a field is a [[Frobenius algebra]], with Frobenius form given by the trace of the product: {{nowrap|1=''σ''(''A'', ''B'') = tr(''AB'')}}.

==Structure==
* The matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') can be identified with the [[ring of endomorphisms]] of the [[free module|free ''R''-module]] of rank ''n'', {{nowrap|M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') ≅ End&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.{{clarify|Is R^n here a right module?|date=June 2017}} The procedure for [[matrix multiplication]] can be traced back to compositions of endomorphisms in this endomorphism ring.
* The ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''D'') over a [[division ring]] ''D'' is an [[Artinian ring|Artinian]] [[simple ring]], a special type of [[semisimple ring]].  The rings &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{CFM}_I(D)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{RFM}_I(D)&lt;/math&gt; are ''not'' simple and not Artinian if the set ''I'' is infinite, however they are still [[full linear ring]]s.
* In general, every semisimple ring is isomorphic to a finite direct product of full matrix rings over division rings, which may have differing division rings and differing sizes.  This classification is given by the [[Artin–Wedderburn theorem]].
* There is a one-to-one correspondence between the two-sided [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') and the two-sided ideals of ''R''.  Namely, for each ideal ''I'' of ''R'', the set of all {{nowrap|''n'' × ''n''}} matrices with entries in ''I'' is an ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), and each ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') arises in this way.  This implies that M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is [[simple ring|simple]] if and only if ''R'' is simple. For {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 2}}, not every left ideal or right ideal of M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') arises by the previous construction from a left ideal or a right ideal in ''R''. For example, the set of matrices whose columns with indices 2 through ''n'' are all zero forms a left ideal in M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').
* The previous ideal correspondence actually arises from the fact that the rings ''R'' and M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') are [[Morita equivalent]]. Roughly speaking, this means that the category of left ''R'' modules and the category of left M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') modules are very similar. Because of this, there is a natural bijective correspondence between the ''isomorphism classes'' of the left ''R''-modules and the left M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'')-modules, and between the isomorphism classes of the left ideals of ''R'' and M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''). Identical statements hold for right modules and right ideals.  Through Morita equivalence, M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') can inherit any properties of ''R'' which are Morita invariant, such as being [[simple ring|simple]], [[Artinian ring|Artinian]], [[Noetherian ring|Noetherian]], [[Prime ring|prime]] and numerous other properties as given in the [[Morita equivalence]] article.

== Properties ==

* The matrix ring ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is [[commutative ring|commutative]] if and only if ''R'' is [[commutative ring|commutative]] and {{nowrap|1=''n'' = 1}}. In fact, this is also true for the subring of upper triangular matrices.  Here is an example for 2×2 matrices (in fact, upper triangular matrices) which do not commute:
::&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,
&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:: &lt;math&gt;  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}.\,
&lt;/math&gt;
: This example is easily generalized to ''n''×''n'' matrices.
* For ''n'' &amp;ge; 2, the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') has [[zero divisor]]s and [[nilpotent element]]s, and again, the same thing can be said for the upper triangular matrices. An example in 2×2 matrices would be
:: &lt;math&gt;  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}
=
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 0 \\
    0 &amp; 0
  \end{bmatrix}\,
&lt;/math&gt;.

* The [[center (ring theory)|center]] of a matrix ring over a ring ''R'' consists of the matrices which are scalar multiples of the [[identity matrix]], where the scalar belongs to the center of ''R''.
* In linear algebra, it is noted that over a field ''F'', M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''F'') has the property that for any two matrices ''A'' and ''B'', {{nowrap|1=''AB'' = 1}} implies {{nowrap|1=''BA'' = 1}}.  This is not true for every ring ''R'' though.  A ring ''R'' whose matrix rings all have the mentioned property is known as a [[stably finite ring]] {{harv|Lam|1999|p=5}}.

==Diagonal subring==

Let ''D'' be the set of [[diagonal matrices]] in the matrix ring M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R''), that is the set of the matrices such that every nonzero entry, if any, is on the main diagonal.  Then ''D'' is closed under [[matrix addition]] and [[matrix multiplication]], and contains the [[identity matrix]], so it is a [[subalgebra]] of ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'').

As an [[algebra (ring theory)|algebra over R]], ''D'' is [[algebra homomorphism|isomorphic]] to the [[product of rings|direct product]] of ''n'' copies of ''R''. It is a [[free module|free ''R''-module]] of dimension ''n''. The [[idempotent element (ring theory)|idempotent element]]s of ''D'' are the diagonal matrices such that the diagonal entries are themselves idempotent.

===Two dimensional diagonal subrings===
When ''R'' is the field of [[real number]]s, then the diagonal subring of M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is isomorphic to [[split-complex number]]s. When ''R'' is the field of [[complex number]]s, then the diagonal subring is isomorphic to [[bicomplex number]]s. When ''R'' = ℍ, the [[division ring]] of [[quaternion]]s, then the diagonal subring is isomorphic to the ring of [[split-biquaternion]]s, presented in 1873 by [[William K. Clifford]].

==Matrix semiring==
In fact, ''R'' only needs to be a [[semiring]] for M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') to be defined. In this case, M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is a semiring, called the '''matrix semiring'''. Similarly, if ''R'' is a commutative semiring, then M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is a '''{{visible anchor|matrix semialgebra}}'''.

For example, if ''R'' is the [[Boolean semiring]] (the [[Two-element Boolean algebra]] ''R''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,1} with 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1), then M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''R'') is the semiring of [[binary relation]]s on an ''n''-element set with union as addition, [[composition of relations]] as multiplication, the [[empty relation]] ([[zero matrix]]) as the zero, and the [[identity relation]] ([[identity matrix]]) as the unit.&lt;ref name="droste"&gt;Droste, M., &amp; Kuich, W. (2009). Semirings and Formal Power Series. ''Handbook of Weighted Automata'', 3–28. {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-01492-5_1}}, pp. 7–10&lt;/ref&gt;

The atoms and molecules are allowed to interact for a fixed period of time, giving a view of the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] evolution of the system. In the most common version, the [[trajectory|trajectories]] of atoms and molecules are determined by [[Numerical integration|numerically solving]] [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's equations of motion]] for a system of interacting particles, where [[Force (physics)|forces]] between the particles and their [[potential energy|potential energies]] are often calculated using [[interatomic potential]]s or [[molecular mechanics]] [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]]. The method was originally developed within the field of theoretical physics in the late 1950s&lt;ref name=fput&gt;Fermi E., Pasta J., Ulam S., Los Alamos report LA-1940 (1955).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= a&amp;w&gt;{{cite journal

Because molecular systems typically consist of a vast number of particles, it is impossible to determine the properties of such [[complex systems]] analytically; MD simulation circumvents this problem by using [[Numerical analysis|numerical]] methods. However, long MD simulations are mathematically [[condition number|ill-conditioned]], generating cumulative errors in numerical integration that can be minimized with proper selection of algorithms and parameters, but not eliminated entirely.

For systems which obey the [[ergodic hypothesis]], the evolution of one molecular dynamics simulation may be used to determine macroscopic [[thermodynamic]] properties of the system: the time averages of an ergodic system correspond to [[microcanonical ensemble]] averages. MD has also been termed "statistical mechanics by numbers" and "[[Laplace]]'s vision of [[Newtonian mechanics]]" of predicting the future by animating nature's forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
Following the earlier successes of [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s, the method was first developed by Fermi, Pasta, Ulam and [[Mary Tsingou|Tsingou]]&lt;ref name=fput /&gt; in the mid 50s.

Even before it became possible to simulate molecular dynamics with computers, some undertook the hard work of trying it with physical models such as macroscopic spheres. The idea was to arrange them to replicate the properties of a liquid. [[J.D. Bernal]] said, in 1962: "''... I took a number of rubber balls and stuck them together with rods of a selection of different lengths ranging from 2.75 to 4 inches. I tried to do this in the first place as casually as possible, working in my own office, being interrupted every five minutes or so and not remembering what I had done before the interruption.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= J.D. |last= Bernal |year= 1964 |title= The Bakerian lecture, 1962: The structure of liquids |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society |volume= 280 |issue= 1382 |pages= 299–322 |id= |url= |doi= 10.1098/rspa.1964.0147|bibcode= 1964RSPSA.280..299B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of application and limits ==

Beginning in theoretical [[physics]], the method of MD gained popularity in [[materials science]] and since the 1970s also in [[biochemistry]] and [[biophysics]]. MD is frequently used to refine 3-dimensional structures of [[protein]]s and other [[macromolecule]]s based on experimental constraints from [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In physics, MD is used to examine the dynamics of atomic-level phenomena that cannot be observed directly, such as thin film growth and ion-subplantation, and also to examine the physical properties of [[nanotechnology|nanotechnological]] devices that have not or cannot yet be created. In biophysics and [[structural biology]], the method is frequently applied to study the motions of macromolecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s, which can be useful for interpreting the results of certain biophysical experiments and for modeling interactions with other molecules, as in [[ligand docking]]. In principle MD can be used for [[De novo protein structure prediction|ab initio prediction]] of [[protein structure]] by simulating [[protein folding|folding]] of the [[polypeptide chain]] from [[random coil]].

The results of MD simulations can be tested through comparison to experiments that measure molecular dynamics, of which a popular method is NMR spectroscopy. MD-derived structure predictions can be tested through community-wide experiments in Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction ([[CASP]]), although the method has historically had limited success in this area. [[Michael Levitt]], who shared the [[Nobel Prize]] partly for the application of MD to proteins, wrote in 1999 that CASP participants usually did not use the method due to "''... a central embarrassment of molecular mechanics, namely that energy minimization or molecular dynamics generally leads to a model that is less like the experimental structure.''"&lt;ref name="Koehl"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Koehl |first1= P. |authorlink2= Michael Levitt |last2= Levitt |first2= Michael |year= 1999 |title= A brighter future for protein structure prediction |url= |journal= [[Nature Structural Biology]] |volume= 6 |issue= |pages= 108–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in computational resources permitting more and longer MD trajectories, combined with modern improvements in the quality of [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] parameters, have yielded some improvements in both structure prediction and [[homology model]] refinement, without reaching the point of practical utility in these areas; many identify force field parameters as a key area for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raval|first1=A|last2=Piana|first2=S|last3=Eastwood|first3=MP|last4=Dror|first4=RO|last5=Shaw|first5=DE|title=Refinement of protein structure homology models via long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations.|journal=Proteins|date=August 2012|volume=80|issue=8|pages=2071–9|pmid=22513870|doi=10.1002/prot.24098}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beauchamp|first1=KA|last2=Lin|first2=YS|last3=Das|first3=R|last4=Pande|first4=VS|title=Are Protein Force Fields Getting Better?

Limits of the method are related to the parameter sets used, and to the underlying [[molecular mechanics]] force fields. One run of an MD simulation optimizes the [[potential energy]], rather than the [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] of the protein {{Dubious|date=July 2017}}, meaning that all [[Entropy|entropic contributions]] to [[thermodynamic stability]] of protein structure are neglected, including the [[conformational entropy]] of the polypeptide chain (the main factor that destabilizes protein structure) and [[hydrophobic effect]]s (the main driving forces of protein folding).&lt;ref&gt;Hydrophobic effects are mostly of entropic nature at room temperature.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important factor are intramolecular [[hydrogen bond]]s,&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Myers |first1= J. K. |last2= Pace |first2= C. N. |year= 1996 |title= Hydrogen bonding stabilizes globular proteins |journal= Biophys.

This is a crude approximation because hydrogen bonds have a partially [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] nature. Furthermore, electrostatic interactions are usually calculated using the [[Relative permittivity|dielectric constant]] of [[vacuum]], although the surrounding aqueous solution has a much higher dielectric constant. Using the [[macroscopic]] dielectric constant at short interatomic distances is questionable. Finally, [[Van der Waals force|van der Waals interactions]] in MD are usually described by [[Lennard-Jones potential]]s based on the [[Fritz London]] theory that is only applicable in vacuum. However, all types of van der Waals forces are ultimately of electrostatic origin and therefore depend on [[Permittivity|dielectric properties of the environment]].&lt;ref name="Israelachvili"&gt;[[Jacob Israelachvili|Israelachvili, Jacob]] (1992). ''Intermolecular and surface forces.'' Academic Press, San Diego.&lt;/ref&gt; The direct measurement of attraction forces between different materials (as [[Hamaker constant]]) shows that "the interaction between hydrocarbons across water is about 10% of that across vacuum".&lt;ref name="Israelachvili" /&gt; The environment-dependence of van der Waals forces is neglected in standard simulations, but can be included by developing polarizable force fields.

== Design constraints ==

Design of a molecular dynamics simulation should account for the available computational power. Simulation size (n=number of particles), timestep, and total time duration must be selected so that the calculation can finish within a reasonable time period. However, the simulations should be long enough to be relevant to the time scales of the natural processes being studied. To make statistically valid conclusions from the simulations, the time span simulated should match the [[Kinetics (physics)|kinetics]] of the natural process. Otherwise, it is analogous to making conclusions about how a human walks when only looking at less than one footstep. Most scientific publications about the dynamics of proteins and DNA &lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=de Pablo, J.J. |author3=Mota, J.P.B. |title=Endohedral confinement of a DNA dodecamer onto pristine carbon nanotubes and the stability of the canonical B form |journal=J.

To obtain these simulations, several CPU-days to CPU-years are needed. Parallel algorithms allow the load to be distributed among CPUs; an example is the spatial or force decomposition algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;Plimpton, Steve. [http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp/md.html Molecular Dynamics - Parallel Algorithms]. sandia.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

During a classical MD simulation, the most CPU intensive task is the evaluation of the [[Force field (chemistry)|potential]] as a function of the particles' internal coordinates. Within that energy evaluation, the most expensive one is the non-bonded or non-covalent part. In [[Big O notation]], common molecular dynamics simulations [[analysis of algorithms|scale]] by &lt;math&gt;O(n^2)&lt;/math&gt; if all pair-wise [[electrostatic]] and [[van der Waals forces|van der Waals interactions]] must be accounted for explicitly. This computational cost can be reduced by employing electrostatics methods such as particle mesh [[Ewald summation]] ( &lt;math&gt;O(n \log(n))&lt;/math&gt; ), particle–particle-particle–mesh ([[P3M]]), or good spherical cutoff methods ( &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt; ). {{citation needed |date=December 2017}}

Another factor that impacts total CPU time needed by a simulation is the size of the integration timestep. This is the time length between evaluations of the potential. The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid [[discretization]] errors (i.e., smaller than the period related to fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1&amp;nbsp;femtosecond (10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE [[constraint algorithm]], which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.&lt;ref name="Streett"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Streett WB, Tildesley DJ, Saville G |year=1978 |title=Multiple time-step methods in molecular dynamics |journal=Mol Phys |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=639–648 |doi=10.1080/00268977800100471|bibcode= 1978MolPh..35..639S |last2=Tildesley |last3=Saville}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckerman1991"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1991 |title=Molecular dynamics algorithm for multiple time scales: systems with long range forces |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=94 |issue=10 |pages=6811–6815 |doi=10.1063/1.460259|bibcode= 1991JChPh..94.6811T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tuckerman1992"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tuckerman ME, Berne BJ, Martyna GJ |year=1992 |title=Reversible multiple time scale molecular dynamics |journal=J Chem Phys |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=1990–2001 |doi=10.1063/1.463137|bibcode= 1992JChPh..97.1990T |last2=Berne |last3=Martyna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For simulating molecules in a solvent, a choice should be made between [[Water model|explicit]] and [[implicit solvent]]. Explicit solvent particles (such as the [[TIP3P]], SPC/E and [[Flexible SPC water model|SPC-f]] water models) must be calculated expensively by the force field, while implicit solvents use a mean-field approach. Using an explicit solvent is computationally expensive, requiring inclusion of roughly ten times more particles in the simulation. But the granularity and viscosity of explicit solvent is essential to reproduce certain properties of the solute molecules. This is especially important to reproduce [[chemical kinetics]].

In all kinds of molecular dynamics simulations, the simulation box size must be large enough to avoid [[boundary condition]] artifacts. Boundary conditions are often treated by choosing fixed values at the edges (which may cause artifacts), or by employing [[periodic boundary conditions]] in which one side of the simulation loops back to the opposite side, mimicking a bulk phase (which may cause artifacts too).

=== Microcanonical ensemble (NVE) ===

In the [[microcanonical ensemble]], the system is isolated from changes in moles (N), volume (V), and energy (E). It corresponds to an [[adiabatic process]] with no heat exchange. A microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory may be seen as an exchange of potential and kinetic energy, with total energy being conserved. For a system of N particles with coordinates &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and velocities &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, the following pair of first order differential equations may be written in [[Newton's notation for differentiation|Newton's notation]] as

:&lt;math&gt;F(X) = -\nabla U(X)=M\dot{V}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = \dot{X} (t).&lt;/math&gt;

The potential energy function &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt; of the system is a function of the particle coordinates &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. It is referred to simply as the ''potential'' in physics, or the ''force field'' in chemistry. The first equation comes from [[Newton's laws of motion]]; the force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; acting on each particle in the system can be calculated as the negative gradient of &lt;math&gt;U(X)&lt;/math&gt;.

For every time step, each particle's position &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and velocity &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; may be integrated with a [[symplectic integrator]] method such as [[Verlet integration]]. The time evolution of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called a trajectory. Given the initial positions (e.g., from theoretical knowledge) and velocities (e.g., randomized Gaussian), we can calculate all future (or past) positions and velocities.

One frequent source of confusion is the meaning of [[temperature]] in MD. Commonly we have experience with macroscopic temperatures, which involve a huge number of particles. But temperature is a statistical quantity. If there is a large enough number of atoms, statistical temperature can be estimated from the ''instantaneous temperature'', which is found by equating the kinetic energy of the system to nk&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T/2 where n is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

A temperature-related phenomenon arises due to the small number of atoms that are used in MD simulations. For example, consider simulating the growth of a copper film starting with a substrate containing 500 atoms and a deposition energy of 100 eV. In the real world, the 100 eV from the deposited atom would rapidly be transported through and shared among a large number of atoms (&lt;math&gt;10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; or more) with no big change in temperature. When there are only 500 atoms, however, the substrate is almost immediately vaporized by the deposition. Something similar happens in biophysical simulations. The temperature of the system in NVE is naturally raised when macromolecules such as proteins undergo exothermic conformational changes and binding.

=== Canonical ensemble (NVT) ===

In the [[canonical ensemble]], amount of substance (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of endothermic and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.

A variety of thermostat algorithms are available to add and remove energy from the boundaries of a MD simulation in a more or less realistic way, approximating the [[canonical ensemble]]. Popular methods to control temperature include velocity rescaling, the [[Nosé-Hoover thermostat]], Nosé-Hoover chains, the [[Berendsen thermostat]], the [[Andersen thermostat]] and [[Langevin dynamics]]. The Berendsen thermostat might introduce the [[flying ice cube]] effect, which leads to unphysical translations and rotations of the simulated system.

It is not trivial to obtain a [[canonical ensemble]] distribution of conformations and velocities using these algorithms. How this depends on system size, thermostat choice, thermostat parameters, time step and integrator is the subject of many articles in the field.

=== Isothermal–isobaric (NPT) ensemble ===

In the [[isothermal–isobaric ensemble]], amount of substance (N), pressure (P) and temperature (T) are conserved. In addition to a thermostat, a barostat is needed. It corresponds most closely to laboratory conditions with a flask open to ambient temperature and pressure.

In the simulation of biological membranes, [[isotropic]] pressure control is not appropriate. For lipid bilayers, pressure control occurs under constant membrane area (NPAT) or constant surface tension "gamma" (NPγT).

=== Generalized ensembles ===

The [[replica exchange]] method is a generalized ensemble. It was originally created to deal with the slow dynamics of disordered spin systems. It is also called parallel tempering. The replica exchange MD (REMD) formulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Potentials in MD simulations ==
{{Main|Interatomic potential|Force field (chemistry)|l2=Force field|Comparison of force field implementations}}
A molecular dynamics simulation requires the definition of a [[function (mathematics)|potential function]], or a description of the terms by which the particles in the simulation will interact. In chemistry and biology this is usually referred to as a [[force field (chemistry)|force field]] and in materials physics as an [[interatomic potential]]. Potentials may be defined at many levels of physical accuracy; those most commonly used in chemistry are based on [[molecular mechanics]] and embody a [[classical mechanics]] treatment of particle-particle interactions that can reproduce structural and [[conformational change]]s but usually cannot reproduce [[chemical reaction]]s.

The reduction from a fully quantum description to a classical potential entails two main approximations. The first one is the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]], which states that the dynamics of electrons are so fast that they can be considered to react instantaneously to the motion of their nuclei. As a consequence, they may be treated separately. The second one treats the nuclei, which are much heavier than electrons, as point particles that follow classical Newtonian dynamics. In classical molecular dynamics, the effect of the electrons is approximated as one potential energy surface, usually representing the ground state.

When finer levels of detail are needed, potentials based on [[quantum mechanics]] are used; some methods attempt to create hybrid [[QM/MM|classical/quantum]] potentials where the bulk of the system is treated classically but a small region is treated as a quantum system, usually undergoing a chemical transformation.

=== Empirical potentials ===

Empirical potentials used in chemistry are frequently called [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]], while those used in materials physics are called [[interatomic potential]]s.

Most [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] in chemistry are empirical and consist of a summation of bonded forces associated with [[chemical bond]]s, bond angles, and bond [[dihedral angle|dihedrals]], and non-bonded forces associated with [[van der Waals force]]s and [[electrostatic charge]]. Empirical potentials represent quantum-mechanical effects in a limited way through ad-hoc functional approximations. These potentials contain free parameters such as [[electrostatic charge|atomic charge]], van der Waals parameters reflecting estimates of [[atomic radius]], and equilibrium [[bond length]], angle, and dihedral; these are obtained by fitting against detailed electronic calculations (quantum chemical simulations) or experimental physical properties such as [[Young's modulus|elastic constants]], lattice parameters and [[spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] measurements.

Because of the non-local nature of non-bonded interactions, they involve at least weak interactions between all particles in the system. Its calculation is normally the bottleneck in the speed of MD simulations. To lower the computational cost, [[Force field (chemistry)|force fields]] employ numerical approximations such as shifted cutoff radii, [[reaction field method|reaction field]] algorithms, particle mesh [[Ewald summation]], or the newer particle–particle-particle–mesh ([[P3M]]).

Chemistry force fields commonly employ preset bonding arrangements (an exception being ''[[ab initio quantum chemistry methods|ab initio]]'' dynamics), and thus are unable to model the process of chemical bond breaking and reactions explicitly. On the other hand, many of the potentials used in physics, such as those based on the [[bond order potential|bond order formalism]] can describe several different coordinations of a system and bond breaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sinnott |first1= S.

The potential functions representing the non-bonded energy are formulated as a sum over interactions between the particles of the system. The simplest choice, employed in many popular [[force field (chemistry)|force fields]], is the "pair potential", in which the total potential energy can be calculated from the sum of energy contributions between pairs of atoms. An example of such a pair potential is the non-bonded [[Lennard–Jones potential]] (also termed the 6–12 potential), used for calculating van der Waals forces.

:&lt;math&gt;
U(r) = 4\varepsilon \left[ \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{12} - \left(\frac{\sigma}{r}\right)^{6} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

Another example is the Born (ionic) model of the ionic lattice. The first term in the next equation is [[Coulomb's law]] for a pair of ions, the second term is the short-range repulsion explained by Pauli's exclusion principle and the final term is the dispersion interaction term. Usually, a simulation only includes the dipolar term, although sometimes the quadrupolar term is also included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/jp054304p |pmid=16375450 |author1=Cruz, F.J.A.L. |author2=Canongia Lopes, J.N. |author3=Calado, J.C.G. |author4=Minas da Piedade, M.E. |title=A Molecular Dynamics Study of the Thermodynamic Properties of Calcium Apatites. 1.

&lt;/math&gt;

In many-body potentials, the potential energy cannot be found by a sum over pairs of atoms, as these interactions are calculated explicitly as a combination of higher-order terms. In the statistical view, the dependency between the variables cannot in general be expressed using only pairwise products of the degrees of freedom.

=== Semi-empirical potentials ===

[[Semi-empirical quantum chemistry methods|Semi-empirical]] potentials make use of the matrix representation from quantum mechanics. However, the values of the matrix elements are found through empirical formulae that estimate the degree of overlap of specific atomic orbitals. The matrix is then diagonalized to determine the occupancy of the different atomic orbitals, and empirical formulae are used once again to determine the energy contributions of the orbitals.

There are a wide variety of semi-empirical potentials, termed [[Tight binding (physics)|tight-binding]] potentials, which vary according to the atoms being modeled.

=== Polarizable potentials ===

{{Main|Force field (chemistry)|l1=Force field}}
Most classical force fields implicitly include the effect of [[polarizability]], e.g., by scaling up the partial charges obtained from quantum chemical calculations. These partial charges are stationary with respect to the mass of the atom. But molecular dynamics simulations can explicitly model polarizability with the introduction of induced dipoles through different methods, such as [[Drude particle]]s or fluctuating charges. This allows for a dynamic redistribution of charge between atoms which responds to the local chemical environment.

For many years, polarizable MD simulations have been touted as the next generation. For homogenous liquids such as water, increased accuracy has been achieved through the inclusion of polarizability.&lt;ref name="Lamoureux3"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lamoureux G, Harder E, Vorobyov IV, Roux B, MacKerell AD |year=2006 |title=A polarizable model of water for molecular dynamics simulations of biomolecules |journal=Chem Phys Lett |volume=418 |issue=1 |pages=245–249 |doi=10.1016/j.cplett.2005.10.135|bibcode= 2006CPL...418..245L |last2=Harder |last3=Vorobyov |last4=Roux |last5=MacKerell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sokhan2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sokhan VP, Jones AP, Cipcigan FS, Crain J, Martyna GJ |year=2015 |title=Signature properties of water: Their molecular electronic origins |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=20 |pages=6341–6346 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1418982112 |pmid=25941394 |pmc=4443379|bibcode=2015PNAS..112.6341S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cipcigan"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cipcigan FS, Sokhan VP, Jones AP, Crain J, Martyna GJ |year=2015 |title=Hydrogen bonding and molecular orientation at the liquid–vapour interface of water |journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics |volume=17 |issue=14 |pages=8660–8669 |doi= 10.1039/C4CP05506C |pmid=25715668 |bibcode= 2015PCCP...17.8660C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some promising results have also been achieved for proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Protein−Nanoparticle Interactions: Opportunities and Challenges |journal=Chemical Reviews |date=2011 |volume=111 |issue=9 |pages=5610–37 |doi=10.1021/cr100440g |pmid=21688848 |last1=Mahmoudi |first1=Morteza |last2=Lynch |first2=Iseult |last3=Ejtehadi |first3=Mohammad Reza |last4=Monopoli |first4=Marco P. |last5=Bombelli |first5=Francesca Baldelli |last6=Laurent |first6=Sophie }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Patel2004b&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Patel, S. |author2=MacKerell, Jr. AD |author3=Brooks III, Charles L |year=2004 |title=CHARMM fluctuating charge force field for proteins: II protein/solvent properties from molecular dynamics simulations using a nonadditive electrostatic model |journal=J Comput Chem |volume=25 |pages=1504–1514 |doi=10.1002/jcc.20077 |pmid=15224394 |issue=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is still uncertain how to best approximate polarizability in a simulation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

=== Potentials in ''ab initio'' methods ===
{{Main|Quantum chemistry|List of quantum chemistry and solid state physics software}}

In classical molecular dynamics, one potential energy surface (usually the ground state) is represented in the force field. This is a consequence of the [[Born–Oppenheimer approximation]]. In excited states, chemical reactions or when a more accurate representation is needed, electronic behavior can be obtained from first principles by using a quantum mechanical method, such as [[density functional theory]]. This is named Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD). Due to the cost of treating the electronic degrees of freedom, the computational cost of these simulations is far higher than classical molecular dynamics. This implies that AIMD is limited to smaller systems and shorter times.

''[[Ab initio]]'' [[quantum mechanical]] and [[Quantum chemistry|chemical]] methods may be used to calculate the [[potential energy surface|potential energy]] of a system on the fly, as needed for conformations in a trajectory. This calculation is usually made in the close neighborhood of the [[reaction coordinate]]. Although various approximations may be used, these are based on theoretical considerations, not on empirical fitting. ''Ab initio'' calculations produce a vast amount of information that is not available from empirical methods, such as density of electronic states or other electronic properties. A significant advantage of using ''ab initio'' methods is the ability to study reactions that involve breaking or formation of covalent bonds, which correspond to multiple electronic states.

=== Hybrid QM/MM ===
{{Main|QM/MM}}
QM (quantum-mechanical) methods are very powerful. However, they are computationally expensive, while the MM (classical or molecular mechanics) methods are fast but suffer from several limits (require extensive parameterization; energy estimates obtained are not very accurate; cannot be used to simulate reactions where covalent bonds are broken/formed; and are limited in their abilities for providing accurate details regarding the chemical environment). A new class of method has emerged that combines the good points of QM (accuracy) and MM (speed) calculations. These methods are termed mixed or hybrid quantum-mechanical and molecular mechanics methods (hybrid QM/MM).&lt;ref&gt;The methodology for such methods was introduced by Warshel and coworkers. In the recent years have been pioneered by several groups including: [[Arieh Warshel]] ([[University of Southern California]]), Weitao Yang ([[Duke University]]), Sharon Hammes-Schiffer ([[The Pennsylvania State University]]), Donald Truhlar and Jiali Gao ([[University of Minnesota]]) and Kenneth Merz ([[University of Florida]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important advantage of hybrid QM/MM method is the speed. The cost of doing classical molecular dynamics (MM) in the most straightforward case scales O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where n is the number of atoms in the system. This is mainly due to electrostatic interactions term (every particle interacts with every other particle). However, use of cutoff radius, periodic pair-list updates and more recently the variations of the particle-mesh Ewald's (PME) method has reduced this to between O(n) to O(n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In other words, if a system with twice as many atoms is simulated then it would take between two and four times as much computing power. On the other hand, the simplest ''ab initio'' calculations typically scale O(n&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) or worse (restricted [[Hartree–Fock]] calculations have been suggested to scale ~O(n&lt;sup&gt;2.7&lt;/sup&gt;)). To overcome the limit, a small part of the system is treated quantum-mechanically (typically active-site of an enzyme) and the remaining system is treated classically.

In more sophisticated implementations, QM/MM methods exist to treat both light nuclei susceptible to quantum effects (such as hydrogens) and electronic states. This allows generating hydrogen wave-functions (similar to electronic wave-functions). This methodology has been useful in investigating phenomena such as hydrogen tunneling. One example where QM/MM methods have provided new discoveries is the calculation of hydride transfer in the enzyme liver [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. In this case, [[quantum tunneling]] is important for the hydrogen, as it determines the reaction rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Coarse-graining and reduced representations ===

At the other end of the detail scale are [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained]] and lattice models. Instead of explicitly representing every atom of the system, one uses "pseudo-atoms" to represent groups of atoms. MD simulations on very large systems may require such large computer resources that they cannot easily be studied by traditional all-atom methods. Similarly, simulations of processes on long timescales (beyond about 1 microsecond) are prohibitively expensive, because they require so many time steps. In these cases, one can sometimes tackle the problem by using reduced representations, which are also called [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kmiecik|first=Sebastian|last2=Gront|first2=Dominik|last3=Kolinski|first3=Michal|last4=Wieteska|first4=Lukasz|last5=Dawid|first5=Aleksandra Elzbieta|last6=Kolinski|first6=Andrzej|date=2016-06-22|title=Coarse-Grained Protein Models and Their Applications|journal=Chemical Reviews|doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.6b00163|issn=0009-2665|pmid=27333362|volume=116|issue=14|pages=7898–936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aliphatic tails of lipids are represented by a few pseudo-atoms by gathering 2 to 4 methylene groups into each pseudo-atom.

The parameterization of these very [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] must be done empirically, by matching the behavior of the model to appropriate experimental data or all-atom simulations. Ideally, these parameters should account for both [[enthalpy|enthalpic]] and [[entropy|entropic]] contributions to free energy in an implicit way. When coarse-graining is done at higher levels, the accuracy of the dynamic description may be less reliable. But very [[Coarse-grained modeling|coarse-grained models]] have been used successfully to examine a wide range of questions in structural biology, liquid crystal organization, and polymer glasses.

Examples of applications of coarse-graining:
* [[protein folding]] and [[protein structure prediction]] studies are often carried out using one, or a few, pseudo-atoms per amino acid;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* [[liquid crystal]] phase transitions have been examined in confined geometries and/or during flow using the [[Gay-Berne potential]], which describes anisotropic species;
* [[Polymer]] glasses during deformation have been studied using simple harmonic or [[FENE]] springs to connect spheres described by the [[Lennard-Jones potential]];
* [[Supercoiling|DNA supercoiling]] has been investigated using 1–3 pseudo-atoms per basepair, and at even lower resolution;
* Packaging of [[DNA|double-helical DNA]] into [[bacteriophage]] has been investigated with models where one pseudo-atom represents one turn (about 10 basepairs) of the double helix;
* RNA structure in the [[ribosome]] and other large systems has been modeled with one pseudo-atom per nucleotide.
* Virtual cell simulation to study the interaction of cells and various substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Development of a Virtual Cell Model to Predict Cell Response to Substrate Topography |journal=ACS Nano |date=2017 |volume=11 |issue=9 |pages=9084–9092 |doi=10.1021/acsnano.7b03732 |pmid=28742318 |last1=Heydari |first1=Tiam |last2=Heidari |first2=Maziar |last3=Mashinchian |first3=Omid |last4=Wojcik |first4=Michal |last5=Xu |first5=Ke |last6=Dalby |first6=Matthew John |last7=Mahmoudi |first7=Morteza |last8=Ejtehadi |first8=Mohammad Reza }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of coarse-graining is the ''united atom'' (sometimes called ''extended atom'') and was used in most early MD simulations of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. For example, instead of treating all four atoms of a CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; methyl group explicitly (or all three atoms of CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; methylene group), one represents the whole group with one pseudo-atom. It must, of course, be properly parameterized so that its van der Waals interactions with other groups have the proper distance-dependence. Similar considerations apply to the bonds, angles, and torsions in which the pseudo-atom participates. In this kind of united atom representation, one typically eliminates all explicit hydrogen atoms except those that have the capability to participate in hydrogen bonds (''polar hydrogens''). An example of this is the [[CHARMM]] 19 force-field.

The polar hydrogens are usually retained in the model, because proper treatment of hydrogen bonds requires a reasonably accurate description of the directionality and the electrostatic interactions between the donor and acceptor groups. A hydroxyl group, for example, can be both a hydrogen bond donor, and a hydrogen bond acceptor, and it would be impossible to treat this with one OH pseudo-atom. About half the atoms in a protein or nucleic acid are non-polar hydrogens, so the use of united atoms can provide a substantial savings in computer time.

== Incorporating solvent effects ==
In many simulations of a solute-solvent system the main focus is on the behavior of the solute with little interest of the solvent behavior particularly in those solvent molecules residing in regions far from the solute molecule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Molecular Modelling: Principles and Applications|last=Leach|first=Dr Andrew|date=30 January 2001|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780582382107|edition= 2nd|location=Harlow|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0582382106|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents may influence the dynamic behavior of solutes via random collisions and by imposing a frictional drag on the motion of the solute through the solvent. The use of non-rectangular periodic boundary conditions, stochastic boundaries and solvent shells can all help reduce the number of solvent molecules required and enable a larger proportion of the computing time to be spent instead on simulating the solute. It is also possible to incorporate the effects of a solvent without needing any explicit solvent molecules present. One example of this approach is to use a [[Potential of mean force|potential mean force]] (PMF) which describes how the free energy changes as a particular coordinate is varied. The free energy change described by PMF contains the averaged effects of the solvent.

== Long-range forces ==
A long range interaction is an interaction in which the spatial interaction falls off no faster than &lt;math&gt;r^{-d}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the dimensionality of the system. Examples include charge-charge interactions between ions and dipole-dipole interactions between molecules. Modelling these forces presents quite a challenge as they are significant over a distance which may be larger than half the box length with simulations of many thousands of particles. Though one solution would be to significantly increase the size of the box length, this brute force approach is less than ideal as the simulation would become computationally very expensive. Spherically truncating the potential is also out of the question as unrealistic behaviour may be observed when the distance is close to the cut off distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Computer Simulation of Liquids|last=Allen|first=Michael P.|last2=Tildesley|first2=Dominic J.|date=2017-08-22|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198803201|edition= 2nd|location=|pages=216|language=English|id= {{ASIN|0198803206|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) ==

Steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, or force probe simulations, apply forces to a protein in order to manipulate its structure by pulling it along desired degrees of freedom. These experiments can be used to reveal structural changes in a protein at the atomic level. SMD is often used to simulate events such as mechanical unfolding or stretching.&lt;ref name="Nienhaus"&gt;{{cite book |title=Protein-ligand interactions: methods and applications |author=Nienhaus, Gerd Ulrich |year=2005 |pages=54–56 |isbn=978-1-61737-525-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two typical protocols of SMD: one in which pulling velocity is held constant, and one in which applied force is constant. Typically, part of the studied system (e.g., an atom in a protein) is restrained by a harmonic potential. Forces are then applied to specific atoms at either a constant velocity or a constant force. [[Umbrella sampling]] is used to move the system along the desired reaction coordinate by varying, for example, the forces, distances, and angles manipulated in the simulation. Through umbrella sampling, all of the system's configurations—both high-energy and low-energy—are adequately sampled. Then, each configuration's change in free energy can be calculated as the [[potential of mean force]].&lt;ref name="Leszczyński"&gt;{{cite book |title=Computational chemistry: reviews of current trends, Volume 9 |author=Leszczyński, Jerzy |year=2005 |pages=54–56 |isbn=978-981-256-742-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular method of computing PMF is through the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM), which analyzes a series of umbrella sampling simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Shankar|author2=Rosenberg, John M. |author3=Bouzida, Djamal |author4=Swendsen, Robert H. |author5=Kollman, Peter A. |title=The weighted histogram analysis method for free-energy calculations on biomolecules.

The following biophysical examples illustrate notable efforts to produce simulations of a systems of very large size (a complete virus) or very long simulation times (up to 1.112 milliseconds):
* MD simulation of the full ''[[satellite tobacco mosaic virus]]'' (STMV) (2006, Size: 1 million atoms, Simulation time: 50 ns, program: [[NAMD]]) This virus is a small, icosahedral plant virus that worsens the symptoms of infection by Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Molecular dynamics simulations were used to probe the mechanisms of [[Virus#Structure|viral assembly]]. The entire STMV particle consists of 60 identical copies of one protein that make up the viral [[capsid]] (coating), and a 1063 nucleotide single stranded RNA [[genome]]. One key finding is that the capsid is very unstable when there is no RNA inside. The simulation would take one 2006 desktop computer around 35 years to complete. It was thus done in many processors in parallel with continuous communication between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/STMV/ |title=Molecular dynamics simulation of the Satellite Tobacco Mosaic Virus (STMV) |vauthors=Freddolino P, Arkhipov A, Larson SB, McPherson A, Schulten K |work=Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group |publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Folding simulations of the [[Villin]] Headpiece in all-atom detail (2006, Size: 20,000 atoms; Simulation time: 500 µs= 500,000 ns, Program: [[Folding@home]]) This simulation was run in 200,000 CPU's of participating personal computers around the world. These computers had the Folding@home program installed, a large-scale distributed computing effort coordinated by [[Vijay Pande]] at Stanford University. The kinetic properties of the Villin Headpiece protein were probed by using many independent, short trajectories run by CPU's without continuous real-time communication. One method employed was the Pfold value analysis, which measures the probability of folding before unfolding of a specific starting conformation. Pfold gives information about [[Phi value analysis|transition state]] structures and an ordering of conformations along the [[Protein folding|folding pathway]]. Each trajectory in a Pfold calculation can be relatively short, but many independent trajectories are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jayachandran|first1=Guha|last2=Vishal|first2=V.|last3=Pande|first3=Vijay S.|title=Using massively parallel simulation and Markovian models to study protein folding: Examining the dynamics of the villin headpiece|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|date=28 April 2006|volume=124|issue=16|pages=164902|doi=10.1063/1.2186317|pmid=16674165|bibcode=2006JChPh.124p4902J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E. Shaw Research]]. The longest published result of a simulation performed using Anton is a 1.112-millisecond simulation of NTL9 at 355 K; a second, independent 1.073-millisecond simulation of this configuration was also performed (and many other simulations of over 250 µs continuous chemical time).&lt;ref name="DESRES-Science2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Lindorff-Larsen |first1= Kresten |last2= Piana |first2= Stefano |last3= Dror |first3= Ron O. |last4= Shaw |first4= David E. |year= 2011 |title= How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold |url= |journal= Science |volume= 334 |issue= 6055 |pages= 517–520 |doi=10.1126/science.1208351 |pmid= 22034434 |bibcode= 2011Sci...334..517L|citeseerx= 10.1.1.1013.9290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''How Fast-Folding Proteins Fold'', researchers Kresten Lindorff-Larsen, Stefano Piana, Ron O.

A memorial plaque for Parker is located in the [[Netherton, Peterborough|Netherton]] area of Peterborough where a [[Association football|football]] match is played each year in his memory.

==Background==
Ross Parker was born in Peterborough in 1984 to Davinia and Tony Parker.

Nigel Rumfitt QC, defending Awan, summarised the crime by stating: "These people were not taking the night air. Every member of the group knew what was going on. These weapons had been selected before they set off. The knife was far too big to be hidden from the others. There is no doubt there was a hunting party looking for a victim."&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET9/&gt;

On 19 December 2002, Nazir, Awan and Ali were all found guilty of murder in [[Unanimous#Juries|unanimous verdicts]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name=peterboroughtoday2/&gt; The judge, [[Edwin Jowitt|Sir Edwin Jowitt]], summarised the murder during sentencing:

{{Quote|You put your heads together with the purpose of arming yourselves and of attacking an innocent man you might find by chance simply because he was of a different race to yourselves. A racist killing must be one of the gravest kinds of killing.}}

The judge concluded that Awan had wielded the knife, was the ringleader of the group and had intended to kill.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The three received [[life sentences]], with Awan to serve a minimum of 18 years and the others at least 16. Mahrad was cleared of murder and [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Post-trial and appeals==
After the trial it was revealed that Nazir had previously been [[police caution|cautioned]] for using threatening behaviour in 1999 and fined for resisting arrest.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; The two Labour politicians, Akhtar and Choudhary, who provided Ali's references were later jailed themselves for forgery in relation to [[Electoral fraud|vote rigging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Awan and Nazir [[appealed]] against their jail terms in January 2008 but the original sentences were upheld. Judge [[Nigel Davis|Justice Davis]] said he had taken into account "moving" statements from Parker's family.&lt;ref name=HMCourts2&gt;

==Reporting==
The BBC Editorial Standards Committee in 2007 found that "there was no evidence to suggest that the BBC had shown a specific and systemic bias in favour of cases where the victim had been black or Asian", but accepted it had "underplayed its coverage of the Ross Parker case" and repeated the failings in its coverage of the [[Murder of Kriss Donald]].&lt;ref name=BBCcomplaint&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/assets/files/pdf/appeals/esc_bulletins/30oct07.pdf|title=Editorial Standards Findings: Appeals to the Trust and other editorial standards matters considered by the Editorial Standards Committee|publisher=The BBC Trust|date=30 October 2007|accessdate=2 May 2014|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacKenzie criticised newspapers including his own employer, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''. He stated, "if you believe you're a victim of an [[ethnic minority]] and you're white there is nowhere to go. Editors are so liberal that they are scared to be seen that they're moving to the [[Right-wing politics|right]] of their paper". Parker's mother, Davinia, expressed similar concerns that white victims of race crime are ignored. She said "because we are white, English, we didn't get the coverage", adding ""it's as if we don't count".&lt;ref name="Newsnight"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Newsnight|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/6130110.stm|series=Newsnight|serieslink=Newsnight|credits=Presenters:[[Gavin Esler]], [[Martha Kearney]] , Discussion Panel: [[Mark Easton]], [[Kelvin MacKenzie]], [[Lee Jasper]] Interviewee: Davinia Parker|network=[[BBC]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|location=London, UK|airdate=8 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Redefining racist crime|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_6130000/newsid_6130300/6130328.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|publisher= BBC|date=8 November 2006|accessdate=30 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, a ''[[The Sunday Times|Sunday Times]]'' investigation by Brendan Montague examined British newspaper archives for coverage of racist crimes, finding "an almost total [[boycott]] of stories involving the white victims of attacks" whereas "cases involving black and minority ethnic victims are widely reported".&lt;ref name="Sunday Times"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Montague|first=Brendan|title=The hidden white victims of racism|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article633759.ece|newspaper=The Sunday Times|location=London, UK|publisher=News UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629121149/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article633759.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2|archivedate=29 June 2011|date=12 November 2006|accessdate=29 July 2011|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have noted that the lack of coverage is not simply a media issue. [[Peter Fahy]], the spokesman on race issues for the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]] said: "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the best thing to do is to try and avoid [discussing such attacks] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage.&lt;ref name="Sunday Times"/&gt; Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating "there was no reason to believe that the attack was racially motivated".&lt;ref name="bbc5"&gt;

American [[Townhall]] commentator Larry Provost focused on the religion of the attackers as the key factor in the murder. Writing in August 2014, he suggested the perpetrators were [[Islamists]] who had been "motivated by religion".&lt;ref name="TownHall"&gt;{{cite news|author=Larry Provost|title=Islamic Terror in the UK|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/larryprovost/2014/08/15/islamic-terror-in-the-uk-n1878301/page/full|work=TownHall.com|location=Nashville|publisher=Salem Web Network|date=15 August 2014|accessdate=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newspaper which covered Parker's murder more extensively faced criticism. The [[Government Office for the East of England]] produced a report by Dr Roger Green examining race relations in Peterborough. The document suggested that the ''[[Peterborough Evening Telegraph]]'' had a history of insensitivity, and coverage of the case was "possibly adding to any climate of racial and communal unrest". The criticism of the paper was rejected by a senior police officer and an Asian community leader, both of whom praised its handling of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Race: Report critical of '50s attitude' to race issues|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment/race_report_critical_of_50s_attitude_to_race_issues_1_105934|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough|publisher=Johnston Press|date=5 April 2002|accessdate=3 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The leader of [[Peterborough City Council]] called the report by Dr Green
unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism: City leaders' anger at 'biased' report|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/local/racism-city-leaders-anger-at-biased-report-1-105940|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough|publisher=Johnston Press|date=4 April 2002|accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Parker's murder led to increased racial tensions in Peterborough. At his former school, three Asian pupils were suspended for an attack on an Afro-Caribbean pupil; a relative of the victim then attacked an Asian teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Parker's death also had a major impact on his family. His mother, Davinia, was unable to work for three months after Parker's funeral and came close to attempting suicide on a number of occasions. Parker's room was left largely untouched for three years after the incident because his parents were reluctant to tidy it. They described the room as a place they "feel close to Ross".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5/&gt;&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET1/&gt;

As a result of the murder of Parker, local authorities set up a unity scheme, whereby gang members from different communities were trained as youth workers to ease racial tensions and reduce violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Jonathan|title=How two racists faced each other in court, then shunned prejudice to become friends|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/how-two-racists-faced-each-other-in-court-then-shunned-prejudice-to-become-friends-415258.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=London, UK|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=9 September 2006|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, problems still persisted, with racist [[graffiti]] painted by "yobs" and "thugs" near the murder scene two years after the incident reading "[[no go area]] for whites", "[[Paki (slur)|Paki]] powa" and "death to whites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racism: Community condemns graffiti|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment_2_17112/racism_community_condemns_graffiti_1_144031|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough, UK|publisher=Johnston Press|date=11 September 2003|accessdate= 29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Easton]] cited the Parker case as demonstrating how society has been forced to redefine racism and discard the erroneous definition of "prejudice plus power"—a definition which, in Easton's view, tended to only allow [[ethnic minorities]] to be victims and whites to be perpetrators. He also considered that "Describing an incident as racist may say as much about a victim's mindset as the offender. How else can one explain the British Crime Survey finding that 3,100 car thefts from Asians were deemed to be racially motivated?"&lt;ref name="BBC News 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Easton|first=Mark|title=Racism and race crime redefined|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6128466.stm|work=BBC News|location=London, UK|publisher=BBC|date=8 November 2006|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yasmin Alibhai-Brown condemned the [[double standards]] of [[racial equality]] campaigners in relation to the case, suggesting [[Black British|black]] activists should "march and remember victims like Ross Parker ... our values are worthless unless all victims of these senseless deaths matter equally". She went on to write that "to treat some victims as more worthy of condemnation than others is unforgivable and a betrayal of [[anti-racism]] itself".&lt;ref name="Evening Standard"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Independent1&gt;{{cite news|last=Alibhai-Brown|first=Yasmin|title=Brown/Black racism is every bit as bad as white racism|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/yasmin-alibhai-brown/black-racism-is-every-bit-as-bad-as-white-racism-596435.html|newspaper=The Independent|location=London, UK|publisher=Independent Print Limited|date=3 February 2003|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
Parker's funeral took place at Peterborough [[Crematory|Crematorium]] in [[Marholm]] on 23 October 2001 and more than 400 mourners attended. His "number 14" Netherton United [[Kit (association football)|football shirt]] was draped over his coffin and his teammates formed a [[guard of honour]] dressed in the same strip (kit). [[The Reverend]] Geoffrey Keating described Parker as "a beacon of light who inspired so many people" and "an extremely popular young man".&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Murdered — Tributes to Ross on eve of funeral|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment_2_17112/murdered_tributes_to_ross_on_eve_of_funeral_1_104976|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough, UK|publisher=Johnston Press|date=22 October 2001|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder received little attention from politicians, although in 2003 [[Peterborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Peterborough]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[Helen Clark (British politician)|Helen Clark]] made a statement in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] sending condolences to Parker's family, paying tribute to the Peterborough community and in particular Parker's former school. She described Parker's killers only as "men older than him" and her tributes were echoed by [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard|house=House of Commons|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030123/halltext/30123h01.htm|date=23 January 2003|column=160WH|accessdate=3 January 2012|title=Parliament UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] was installed in [[Netherton, Peterborough|Netherton]] in Peterborough as a memorial to Parker, and a further memorial is located at Peterborough Crematorium.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8/&gt; His former football team mates and friends also play a match every May in his memory and formed a team called "Ross' Rangers".&lt;ref name=PeterboroughET1&gt;{{cite news|last=Franklin|first=Neil|title=In Focus: Three years on the sense of loss is still so real|url=http://www.peterboroughtoday.co.uk/news/environment_2_17112/in_focus_three_years_on_the_sense_of_loss_is_still_so_real_1_151261|newspaper=Peterborough Evening Telegraph|location=Peterborough, UK|publisher=Johnston Press|date=22 September 2004|accessdate=29 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3915">The '''Nordic Language Convention''' is a [[Treaty|convention]] of [[linguistic rights]] that came into force on 1 March 1987, under the auspices of the [[Nordic Council]]. Under the Convention, citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] have the opportunity to use their [[native language]] when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any [[interpreting|interpretation]] or [[translation]] costs. The Convention covers health care, social security, tax, school, and employment authorities, the police and
courts. The languages included are [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norden.org/en/about-nordic-co-operation/treaties-and-agreements/treaties-and-agreements/education-and-research/spraakkonventionen?set_language=en  Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island och Norge om nordiska medborgares rätt att använda sitt eget språk i annat nordiskt land], ''Nordic Council website''.

The Convention is not very well known and is mostly a recommendation.

Coleridge, an English poet, philosopher, literary critic, and founder of the [[Romantic movement]], suggested that the concept of organic form meant that a poem or literary piece was shaped, rather than structured, from within. The use of the form allowed a piece to uniquely develop itself as it unfolded, and ultimately revealed an emphasis on the whole outcome of the piece, including the connections of each development to each other.  
In contrast to the more mechanical processes and rules which many critics believed were necessary for the formation of poetry and works, S.T. Coleridge determined that a more subconscious approach was possible through the, ‘‘imagination of the artist’’ whereby the outcome is an organic form, where ‘‘content and form have coalesced and fused.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatnagar|first=Manmohan K.|year=2000|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7156-631-6|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xRf3GleCQYC&amp;dq=twentieth+century+literature+in+english+vol.2|title=Twentieth Century Literature in English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coleridge's explanation can be found in Vol. 2 of [https://books.google.com/books?id=0xRf3GleCQYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Twentieth Century Literature in English'']
:The form is mechanic when on any given material we impress a predetermined form, not necessarily arising out of the properties of the material-as when to a mass of wet clay we give whatever shape we wish it to retain when hardened. The organic form, on the other hand, is innate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhatnagar|first=Manmohan K.|year=2000|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7156-631-6|pages=128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xRf3GleCQYC&amp;dq=twentieth+century+literature+in+english+vol.2|title=Twentieth Century Literature in English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In R.A. Foake’s Introduction to [https://books.google.com/books?id=kRj3zH0Dck4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Coleridge's+criticism+of+Shakespeare&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=apWRTe6hC9SPcNqLqIkH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "''Coleridge’s criticism of Shakespeare: a selection''"], he defines Coleridge’s defense of Shakespeare’s works as ‘’an act of sympathetic imagination, to enter into the spirit of each work, to reveal its inner organizing principle, and to show how Shakespeare, properly understood, was always in control and exercising judgement,’’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foakes|first=R. A.|year=1989|publisher=Athlone Press Ltd.|location=London|isbn=0-485-11349-X|pages=1–53|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kRj3zH0Dck4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=coleridge%27s+criticism+of+shakespeare:+a+selection+by+R.+A.+Foakes#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Coleridge's criticism of Shakespeare: A selection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding Shakespeare’s much criticized erratic form, Coleridge further imposed the possibilities of organic form:
:...each exterior is the [[physiognomy]] of the being within, its true image reflected and thrown out from the concave mirror; and even such is the appropriate excellence of her chosen poet, our own Shakespeare-himself a nature humanized, a genial understanding directing self-consciously a power and implicit wisdom deeper than consciousness.

Following on from Coleridge’s 18th Century ideas on organic form, was [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], one of the most revered poets of the [[Victorian era]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Academy of American Poets|url=http://www.poets.org|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Hopkins introduced the terms “[[inscape]]” and “instress”. “Inscape” was the core components in individual objects, allowing him to then home in on its relation to other objects and their perception as a whole. “Instress” focussed on the assimilating the immediate apperception and the sensory processes of perception .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levertov|first=Denise|title=Some Notes on Organic Form|journal=Poetry Foundation|date=September 1965|volume=106|issue=6|pages=420–425|jstor=40732772}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20th-Century American poet [[Denise Levertov]] was an artist of organic form. In ‘Some notes on organic form’ she gives credit to Gerard Manley Hopkin’s influence on her own ideas and poetic form: 
:A partial definition, then, of organic poetry might be that it is a method of apperception, i.e., of recognizing what we perceive, and is based on an intuition of an order, a form beyond forms, in which forms partake, and of which man’s creative works are analogies, resemblances, natural allegories. Such poetry is exploratory.

Levertov believed that in order to achieve organic form in literature, the artist must be ‘brought to speech’ through a demanding sensory experience which renders them no choice but to put pen to paper.&lt;ref name="www9.georgetown"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hallisey|first=Joan. F.|title=Denise Levertov (b. 1923)|url=http://www9.georgetown.edu/faculty/bassr/heath/syllabuild/iguide/levertov.html|publisher=Georgetown University|accessdate=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her own work, Levertov concentrated on various techniques such as [[enjambment]], popular with much of Shakespeare’s work, and ‘juxtaposition of key words’ for effect. Avenues were carefully sought and deliberated upon to create the ‘right words, the right image, the right arrangement of the lines on the page’.&lt;ref name="www9.georgetown"/&gt; Many artists of organic form believed that a reader or audience were not immediately, if ever, considered during the construction of a poem or piece. Levertov, included, felt it was essential that a poem be produced from the ‘inner being of the poet’.&lt;ref name="www9.georgetown" /&gt;

Organic form in literature was also theorized by Schelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Matthews|first=Bruce|year=2011|publisher=State University Of New York|location=Albany|title=Schelling’s Organic Form of Philosophy: Life as the Schema of Freedom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Matthews suggests that, insofar as Schelling understands life according to a schema of freedom of thinking, representations are not absolutely different, and subjects and objects are grounded in an identity that links them together. Matthews argues that Schelling’s organic philosophy strives to support an integrated framework where conceptual ideas are scrutinized, challenging ideas and concepts in hopes to create a more significant understanding of the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8326">The '''overshooting model''', or the '''exchange rate overshooting hypothesis''', first developed by economist [[Rudi Dornbusch]], is a theoretical explanation for high levels of [[exchange rate]] volatility. The key features of the model include the assumptions that goods' prices are sticky, or slow to change, in the short run, but the prices of currencies are flexible, that [[arbitrage]] in asset markets holds, via the [[uncovered interest parity]] equation, and that expectations of exchange rate changes are "consistent": that is, [[rational expectations|rational]]. The most important insight of the model is that adjustment lags in some parts of the economy can induce compensating volatility in others; specifically, when an [[exogenous]] variable changes, the short-term effect on the exchange rate can be greater than the long-run effect, so in the short term, the exchange rate ''overshoots'' its new equilibrium long-term value. 
 
Dornbusch developed this model back when many economists held the view that ideal markets should reach equilibrium and stay there. Volatility in a market, from this perspective, could only be a consequence of imperfect or [[information asymmetry|asymmetric information]] or adjustment obstacles in that market. Rejecting this view, Dornbusch argued that volatility is in fact a far more fundamental property than that.

According to the model, when a change in monetary policy occurs (e.g., an unanticipated permanent increase in the money supply), the market will adjust to a new equilibrium between prices and quantities. Initially, because of the "stickiness" of prices of goods, the new short run equilibrium level will first be achieved through shifts in financial market prices. Then, gradually, as prices of goods "unstick" and shift to the new equilibrium, the [[foreign exchange market]] continuously reprices, approaching its new long-term equilibrium level. Only after this process has run its course will a new long-run equilibrium be attained in the domestic money market, the currency exchange market, and the goods market.

As a result, the foreign exchange market will initially overreact to a monetary change, achieving a new short run equilibrium. Over time, goods prices will eventually respond, allowing the foreign exchange market to dissipate its overreaction, and the economy to reach the new long run equilibrium in all markets.

== Outline of the model ==

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Assumption 1:
| Aggregate demand is determined by the standard open economy [[IS-LM]] mechanism
|}
That is to say, the position of the Investment Saving (IS) curve is determined by the volume of injections into the flow of income and by the competitiveness of Home country output measured by the real exchange rate.

The first assumption is essentially saying that the IS curve (demand for goods) position is in some way dependent on the real [[effective exchange rate]] Q.

That is, [IS = C + I + G +Nx(Q)]. In this case, net exports is dependent on Q (as Q goes up, foreign countries' goods are relatively more expensive, and home countries' goods are cheaper, therefore there are higher net exports).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Assumption 2:
| Financial Markets are able to adjust to shocks instantaneously, and investors are risk neutral.
|}
If financial markets can adjust instantaneously and investors are risk neutral, it can be said the uncovered [[interest rate parity]] (UIP) holds at all times. That is, the equation r = r*  + Δs&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; holds at all times (explanation of this formula is below).

It is clear, then, that an expected depreciation/appreciation offsets any current difference in the exchange rate. If r &gt; r*, the exchange rate (domestic price of one unit of foreign currency) is expected to increase. That is, the domestic currency depreciates relative to the foreign currency.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Assumption 3:
| In the short run, goods prices are 'sticky'. That is, aggregate supply is horizontal in the short run, though it is positively sloped in the long run.
|}
In the long run, the exchange rate(s) will equal the long run equilibrium exchange rate,(ŝ).

'''Formal Notation'''

[1] r = r* +Δse (uncovered interest rate parity - approximation)

[2] Δs&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; = θ(ŝ – s) (Expectations of market participants)

[3] m - p = ky-lr (Demand/Supply on money)

[4] y&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = h(s-p) = h(q) (demand for the home country output)

[5] þ = π(yd- ŷ)(proportional change in prices with respect to time) dP/dTime

From the above can be derived the following (using algebraic substitution)

[6] p - p_hat = - lθ(ŝ - s)

[7] þ = π[h(s-p) - ŷ]

'''In equilibrium'''

y&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; = ŷ (demand for output equals the long run demand for output)

from this substitution shows that
[8] ŷ/h = ŝ - p_hat
That is, in the long run, the only variable that affects the real exchange rate is growth in capacity output.

Also, 
Δs&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 (that is, in the long run the expected change of inflection is equal to zero)

Substituting into [2] yields r = r*.
Substituting that into [6] shows:

[9] p_hat = m -kŷ + l r*

taking [8] &amp; [9] together:

[10] ŝ = ŷ(h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; - k) + m +lr*

comparing [9] &amp; [10], it is clear that the only difference between them is the intercept (that is the slope of both is the same). This reveals that given a rise in money stock pushes up the long run values of both in equally proportional measures, the real exchange rate (q) must remain at the same value as it was before the market shock. Therefore, the properties of the model at the beginning are preserved in long run equilibrium, the original equilibrium was stable.

'''Short run disequilibrium'''

The standard approach is to rewrite the basic equations [6] &amp; [7] in terms of the deviation from the long run equilibrium).
In equilibrium [7] implies 0 = π[h(ŝ-p_hat) - ŷ]
Subtracting this from [7] yields

[11] þ = π[h(q-q_hat) 
The rate of exchange is positive whenever the real exchange rate is above its equilibrium level, also it is moving towards the equilibrium level] - This yields the direction and movement of the exchange rate.

In equilibrium, [9] hold, that is [6] - [9] is the difference from equilibrium.
→←←
[12] p - p_hat = -lθ(s-ŝ)
This shows the line upon which the exchange rate must be moving (the line with slope -lθ).

Both [11] &amp; [12] together demonstrates that the exchange rate will be moving towards the long run equilibrium exchange rate, whilst being in a position that implies that it was initially overshot.
From the assumptions above, it is possible to derive the following situation. 
This demonstrated the overshooting and subsequent readjustment. In the graph on the top left, So is the initial long run equilibrium, S1 is the long run equilibrium after the injection of extra money and S2 is where the exchange rate initially jumps to (thus overshooting). When this overshoot takes place, it begins to move back to the new long run equilibrium S1.

[[Image:Manuel - Epistola de victoria contra infideles habita, 1507 - 4592250.tif|thumb|''Epistola de victoria contra infideles habita'', 1507]]

On 5 December 1496, [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I of Portugal]] signed the decree of expulsion of Jews and Muslims to take effect by the end of October of the next year.&lt;ref name=Decree&gt;António José Saraiva: The Marrano Factory: The Portuguese Inquisition and Its New Christians 1536-1765, BRILL, 2001, {{ISBN|9789004120808}}, p. 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Until the 15th century, some Jews occupied prominent places in Portuguese political and economic life. For example, [[Isaac Abrabanel]] was  the treasurer of King [[Afonso V of Portugal]]. Many also had an active role in [[Portuguese culture]], and they kept their reputation of diplomats and merchants. By this time, [[Lisbon]] and [[Évora]] were home to important Jewish communities.

== Expulsion of Jews==
[[File:A Expulsão dos Judeus (Roque Gameiro, Quadros da História de Portugal, 1917).png|250px|thumb|Expulsion of the Jews in 1497, in a 1917 watercolour by [[Alfredo Roque Gameiro]]]]
On 5 December 1496, because a clause of the contract of marriage between himself and [[Isabella, Princess of Asturias (1470–1498)|Isabella, Princess of Asturias]] stipulated he do so in order to win her hand, King [[Manuel I of Portugal]] decreed that all Jews must convert to [[Catholicism]] or leave the country. One set of laws demonstrated the King's wish to completely and forever eradicate Judaism from Portugal.&lt;ref name=Decree/&gt; The initial edict of expulsion was turned into an edict of forced conversion in 1497: Portuguese Jews were prevented from leaving the country and forcibly converted to Christianity. 
Hard times followed for the Portuguese conversos, with [[Lisbon Massacre|the massacre of 2,000 individuals in Lisbon in 1506]] and the later and even more relevant establishment of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]] in 1536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sao Tome &amp; Principle|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/saotome_principe.html|website=Jewish Virtual Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese inquisition was extinguished in 1821 by the "General Extraordinary and Constituent [[Portuguese Cortes|Courts of the Portuguese Nation]]".

When the King allowed conversos to leave after the Lisbon massacre of 1506, many went to the Ottoman Empire (notably [[Thessaloniki]] and [[Constantinople]] and to [[Wattasid Dynasty|Morocco]]. Smaller numbers went to [[Amsterdam]], [[Kingdom of France|France]], [[Colony of Brazil|Brazil]], [[Curaçao]] and the [[Antilles]]. In some of these places their presence can still be witnessed, like the use of the [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] language by some Jewish communities in [[Turkey]], the [[Papiamento|Portuguese based dialects]] of the Antilles, or the multiple [[synagogue]]s built by those who became known as the [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]], such as the [[Amsterdam Esnoga]].

Jews who converted to Christianity were known as [[New Christians]], and were always under the constant surveillance of the Inquisition. Many of those were [[crypto-Jew]]s who continued to secretly practice their religion; they eventually left the country in the centuries to come and again embraced openly their Jewish faith. Such was the case, for example, of the family of Baruch Spinoza.

[[File:Inquis1.jpg|thumb|250px|Burning of Crypto-Jews in Lisbon, Portugal]]
Some of the most famous descendants of Portuguese Jews who lived outside Portugal are the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] (from Portuguese Bento de Espinosa), and the classical economist [[David Ricardo]].

=== Crypto-Jews ===

Some Jews, very few, like the [[Belmonte Jews]], went for a different and radical solution, practicing their faith in a strict secret isolated community. Known as the [[Marranos]], some have survived until today (basically only the community from Belmonte, plus some more isolated families) by the practice of inmarriage and few cultural contacts with the outside world. Only recently have they re-established contact with the international Jewish community and openly practice their religion in a public synagogue with a formal [[rabbi]].

==Expulsion of Muslims==
According to contemporary historian François Soyer, the expulsion of Muslims from Portugal has been overshadowed by the forced conversion of Jews in the country.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=241}} While tolerance of Muslim minorities in Portugal was higher than in any other part of Europe,{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=258}} Muslims were still perceived as "alien."{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=254, 259}} Anti-Muslim riots were regular in neighboring [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] during the 1460s; however, no similar acts of violence occurred in Portugal.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=258}}

In December 1496, Manuel I ordered all Muslim subjects to leave without any apparent provocation.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=242}} According to 15th-century Portuguese historians [[Damião de Góis]] and [[Jerónimo Osório]], the Portuguese government originally planned to forcibly convert or execute Muslims as they had done to Jews, but fear of retaliation from Muslim kingdoms in North Africa led the king to settle on deportations instead.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|pp=260-261}} Manuel I's motivation behind the order is unclear, but some contemporary historians say it was part of a greater goal of Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] and King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand]] (known as the "[[Catholic Monarchs]]") to rid the peninsula of Muslims and create "religious uniformity" and "monolithic Catholic Christian unity".{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=269}} Other historians say it was influenced by ambitions of conquering Morocco,{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=280}} or by the suggestion of the Dominican confessor to the king, Friar Jorge Vogado.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=273}} Some Muslims found refuge in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]],{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=262}} but most fled to North Africa.{{sfn|Soyer|2007|p=268}}

== Return of some Jews to Portugal ==

In the 19th century, some affluent families of Sephardi Jewish Portuguese origin such as the Ruah and Bensaude, resettled in Portugal from Morocco. The first synagogue to be built in Portugal since the 15th century was the [[Lisbon Synagogue]], inaugurated in 1904.

In 2014 the Portuguese parliament changed the [[Portuguese nationality law]] in order to grant Portuguese nationality to descendants of [[Sephardi Jews]] expelled from Portugal. The law is a reaction to historical events that led to their expulsion from Portugal, but also due to increased concerns over Jewish communities throughout Europe. In order to obtain Portuguese nationality, the person must have a family surname that attests to being a direct descendant of a Sephardi of Portuguese origin or family connections in a collateral line from a former Portuguese Sephardi community. Use of expressions in Portuguese in Jewish rites or [[Judaeo-Portuguese]] or [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] can also be considered proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publico.pt/politica/noticia/descendentes-de-judeus-sefarditas-ja-vao-poder-pedir-a-nacionalidade-1684394|title=Descendentes de judeus sefarditas já vão poder pedir a nacionalidade|author=Lusa|work=PÚBLICO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2015 several hundred [[Turkish Jews]] who were able to prove descent from [[Portuguese Jews]] expelled in 1497 [[immigration to Portugal|emigrated to Portugal]] and acquired [[Portuguese nationality law#Jewish Law of Return|Portuguese citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/amid-rising-european-anti-semitism-portugal-sees-jewish-renaissance/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesofisrael.com/new-citizenship-law-has-jews-flocking-to-tiny-portugal-city/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jta.org/2015/03/03/news-opinion/world/portugal-open-to-citizenship-applications-by-descendants-of-sephardic-jews&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13124">The '''"Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States"''' was a report submitted to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] on July 13, 1790, by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Thomas Jefferson]].

At the [[First United States Congress]], which met in 1789 when the decimal [[metric system]] had not yet been developed in France, the system of units to be used in the future USA was one point of discussion. Under the Constitution (article I, section 8), the Congress has the constitutional right to decide on a standard of [[weights and measures]]. On January 2, 1790, [[George Washington]] urged Congress to address the need for the uniform system of weights and measures, and on January 15, 1790, the House of Representatives requested Thomas Jefferson to draw up a plan.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Linklater|first=Andro|title=Measuring America: How the United States Was Shaped by the Greatest Land Sale in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gtTZAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=2003|publisher=Plume|isbn=978-0-452-28459-3|pages=103–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decimal [[United States dollar|dollar]] had already been agreed upon in principle in 1785,&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(jc0295)) Journals of the Continental Congress], Wednesday, July 6, 1785&lt;/ref&gt; but would not be implemented until after passage of the [[Coinage Act (1792)|Mint Act]] in 1792. In mid-1790 Jefferson proposed two systems of units. The first was evolutionary, and was based on refinement of the definitions of the units of the existing [[English unit|English system]], as well as simplification of their relationship to each other. The second system was revolutionary, and was based on units linked by powers of ten, very similar to the decimal metric system which would be proposed in France. The base units for length, mass, and volume in Jefferson's revolutionary system (named the foot, the ounce, and the bushel, respectively) were relatively close in size to their pre-existing counterparts and bore identical names, although the manner in which they were defined was very different. 

Jefferson's proposal was the world's first scientifically based, fully integrated, decimal system of weights and measures.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003" /&gt;

==The seconds pendulum basis==
In coordination with scientists in France, Jefferson selected the [[seconds pendulum]] at 45° latitude as the basic reference. For technical reasons, he proposed using a uniform rod as the [[pendulum]] rather than a traditional pendulum.  The pendulum was estimated to be 39.14912 English inches long (in the inches of that time—it wasn't until much later that the inch was defined to be 25.4&amp;nbsp;mm), or 1.5 times that for a vibrating rod (58.72368&amp;nbsp;inches).

==More traditional proposal==
In the evolutionary approach, the foot was to be derived from one of these lengths by a simple integer factor, which would be either three (pendulum) or five (rod), i.e. lengthening it from the traditional value by 1.04970¯6&amp;nbsp;inches to ca. 331.463&amp;nbsp;mm or shortening it by 0.255264&amp;nbsp;inches to ca. 298.317&amp;nbsp;mm. For practical purposes he wanted the rod to be 58¾ (new) inches long, an increase of less than 0.045%.

==Decimal system based on the foot==
Jefferson's proposed decimal system preceded the adoption in France of the decimal metric system, although both developed simultaneously. In France, the metre was to be defined as the ten-millionth part of an arc between the North Pole and the equator. Jefferson's system was based on the length of a rod oscillating seconds at 45 degrees latitude, with the foot defined as one fifth of the length of such a rod. Similar to the French system, Jefferson proposed a system of units linked directly by powers of ten. However, Jefferson's system did not make use of the concept of prefixes, which were of great importance in the French system. Instead, the names of old units were carried over into the new system for decimal multiples of the base units, giving them new values. 

Asserting the value of such thorough reform to the existing system of weights and measures, the report stated:

{{quote|But if it be thought that, either now, or at any future time, the citizens of the United States may be induced to undertake a thorough reformation of their whole system of measures, weights and coins, reducing every branch to the same decimal ratio already established in their coins, and thus bringing the calculation of the principal affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man who can multiply  and divide plain numbers, greater changes will be necessary.}}The following table lists the units of the Jeffersonian decimal system, and their relationship with one another. The values of these units are based on Jefferson's proposal of a foot that was equal in length to one-fifth of a second rod, one quarter-inch shorter than the foot in use at the time, and approximately equal to 0.298461684 m.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hellman|first=C.

The [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffplan.asp transcript of the original document] gives the value of a kental as 16 stones at one point and 10 stones in another point.  10 was presumably the intended value, given the otherwise consistent decimalization.

==Subsequent developments==
Under the [[United States Constitution]], Article 1 Section 8, Congress shall have power "To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures". In his first annual message to Congress (what later came to be called "[[State of the Union Address]]es") on January 8, 1790 (a few months before Jefferson's report to the House of Representatives), [[George Washington]] stated, "Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to."&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29431 George Washington: First Annual Message], accessed October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington repeated similar calls for action in his second&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29432 George Washington: Second Annual Message], accessed October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and third&lt;ref&gt;The American Presidency Project, [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29433 George Washington: Third Annual Message], accessed October 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; annual messages (after Jefferson's report). Jefferson's decimal proposal had the support of [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[James Madison]], [[James Monroe]], and George Washington. [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] was a powerful opponent of the proposal.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"/&gt; In late 1791 the Senate appointed a committee to report on the subject and make recommendations. The committee reported in April 1792, unanimously endorsing Jefferson's decimal system. The Senate was slow to act on the matter and while they delayed events in France complicated the issue. Although French scientists working on a decimal system had originally supported using the seconds pendulum as a scientific basis, and Jefferson had deliberately matched his seconds pendulum proposal to the French one, based on a measurement at the latitude of Paris, the French decided to use the length of a [[Meridian (geography)|meridian of the Earth]] instead of a seconds pendulum. This and other developments changed what had promised to be an internationally developed system into a strictly French project. Jefferson wrote, "The element of measure adopted by the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] excludes, ''ipso facto'', every nation on earth from a communion of measurement with them."&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"/&gt;

The Senate continued to consider Jefferson's two proposals, along with a number of new proposals, for several years. In 1795 a bill titled "An Act directing certain experiments to be made to ascertain uniform standards of weights and measures for the United States" was passed by the House and was approved by committee in the Senate, but on the last day of the session the Senate said it would consider the bill during the next session. The bill was never taken up again. In 1795 the [[Northwest Indian War]], which for years had prevented the surveying and sale of land in the [[Northwest Territory]] came to an end. A [[land rush]] of settlers, surveyors, squatters, and others rapidly pushed into the region and the federal government had a sudden and intense need to establish a method for surveying and selling land. On May 18, 1796 Congress passed "an Act for the sale of land of the United States in the territory northwest of the River Ohio, and above the mouth of the Kentucky River". This law defined a survey grid system of 6–mile–square [[Survey township|townships]] divided into 1–mile–square [[Section (United States land surveying)|sections]], with the defining unit being the [[Chain (unit)|chain]], specifically [[Gunter's chain]]. This was the first unit of measurement designated into law by Congress. This law and the way it defined the survey grid ended debate over Jefferson's decimal system.&lt;ref name="Linklater2003"/&gt;

It is thus frequently translated as "dynastic law". The idea of ''kanun'' first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]] in the aftermath of their invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burak |first=Guy |title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-09027-9 |pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni ("the Lawgiver"), due to his code of laws. 

After the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1258, a practice known to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Mongols]] transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to [[caliphate|caliphs]], [[governor]]s, and sultans alike to "make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia."&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"&gt;Berg, Herbert. "Islamic Law." Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030. In History Reference Center[database online]. Available from Snowden Library . Retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE).&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt; Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt;

The term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan [[Selim I]] (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of [[Ebussuud Efendi|Abu ʾl-Suʿūd]], [[Grand Mufti|grand muftī]] of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Linant de Bellefonds, Y., Cahen, Cl., İnalcık, Halil, and Ed. “Ḳānūn”.

[[File:The Raven Flood Totem. - NARA - 298052.jpg|thumb|The Raven sits on a really jumpy frog after having rescued children from a flood.]]

'''Raven Tales''' are the traditional people and animals [[creation stories]] of the [[indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast]] but are also found among [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]]-speaking peoples and others.  Raven stories exist in nearly all of the First Nations throughout the region but are most prominent in the tales of the [[Tlingit]] and [[Tahltan]] people.

Raven and eagle are known by many different names by many different peoples and is an important figure amongst written and [[oral history|verbal stories]].  His tales are passed down through the generations of [[storytelling|story tellers]] of the people and are of cultural and historical significance.  It's important to note that, from some storytellers' perspective, [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of North America|Native myths]] such as the Raven Tales, as opposed to tall tales and little stories for children, are not entertainment and are cultural property of the clan or individual that the story originates from.  It is customary that others should not tell stories that are owned by another clan, especially if they do not live in the same area.&lt;ref name=ownership&gt;{{cite web|last1=Giese|first1=Paula|title=Who Owns the Stories&amp;nbsp;— A Letter to Eldrbarry|url=http://www.eldrbarry.net/rabb/rvn/whoowns.htm|accessdate=1 September 2014|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While each culture's stories of the Raven are different, there are even those that share the same title; certain attributes of Raven remain the same.  The Raven is always a [[Legendary creature|magical creature]] able to take the form of human, animal, even inanimate objects.  He is a keeper of secrets, and a [[trickster god|trickster]] often focused on satisfying his own [[gluttony]] for whatever he desires.  His stories tell of how worldly things came to be or offer suggestion to children on how to behave.&lt;ref name="boas1"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boas |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Boas |date=October–December 1914 |title=Mythology and Folk-Tales of the North American Indians |jstor=534740 |journal=[[The Journal of American Folklore]] |volume=27 |issue=106 |pages=374 |doi=10.2307/534740 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|394–395}}  Raven's creative nature shows itself through circumstance rather than intent, through the desire to satisfy his own needs, rather than any [[altruistic]] principles.  Raven is both the protagonist among the stories of some groups, and the antagonist of others; he is a hero and an amusement.

Tales that feature the Raven as the hero are specific to areas in the north of the continent such as northern [[British Columbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iToLLxlIIiQC&amp;pg=PA58 | title=Native American Culture | publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group | author=Kuiper, Kathleen | year=2011 | pages=58 | isbn=978-1615301386}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Alaska]] and their peoples,&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|387}} such as the [[Tsimshian]]&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|397}} and the Haida.  [[Kutkh|Similar tales]] appear in [[Chukchi people|Chukchi]] cultures in the north-east of Asia and it is probable that they are influenced by Native American stories.&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|383–384}}

The [[Haida people|Haida]] First Nation credits Raven with finding the first humans  hiding in a clam shell; he brought them berries and salmon.  The [[Sioux]] tell of how a [[common raven|white raven]] used to warn [[american bison|buffalo]] of approaching hunters.  Eventually an angry shaman caught the bird and threw it into a fire, turning it black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nyxks|title=How The Raven Became Black|url=http://pathwalkers.wordpress.com/2000/11/27/how-the-raven-became-black/|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=27 November 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200251/http://pathwalkers.wordpress.com/2000/11/27/how-the-raven-became-black/|archivedate=10 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=October 2014}}

==Common features==
While Raven tales tell the origins of human beings, they do not address the origins of organized society. In tales which mirror development and organization of Native American societies, the hero is often humanity itself. Raven tales do not offer a detailed picture about the social relations and realities of life.&lt;ref name="boas1"/&gt;{{rp|395–397}}

{{further|Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast}}

===Athabaskan===
{{further|Athabaskan languages}}
Athabaskan is the language family of several contiguous dialects spoken by various peoples in Western Canada and the American West.  They can be further subdivided into the [[Northern Athabaskan]], [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan]], and [[Southern Athabaskan]] subregions.

These groups lived in one of the 3 Athabaskan regions.

====Cahto====
The [[Cahto]] are an [[indigenous Californian]] group of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The Kato lived farthest south of all the Athapascans in California, occupying Cahto Valley and [[Long Valley Caldera|Long Valley]], and in general the country south of [[Blue Rock Springs Creek|Blue Rock]] and between the headwaters of the two main branches of [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]]. The Kato language is one of  four [[Athabascan language|Athabaskan]] languages that were spoken in northwestern California. Most Kato speakers were also bilingual in [[Northern Pomo language|Northern Pomo]].

=====Creation story=====
One version of the Raven creation story is that of the Cahto in California.&lt;ref name=goddard&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goddard|first1=Pliny Earle|authorlink=Pliny Earle Goddard|author2=Bill Ray|title=Kato texts|journal=Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnography|volume=8|issue=3| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v8k6AQAAIAAJ|accessdate=24 August 2012|year=1909|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one variant, Raven is taught by his father, Kit-ka'ositiyi-qa, to be a creator, but Raven is unsatisfied with the result. He creates the world but is unable to give it light or water.  On hearing that light could be found hidden in a far-off land, Raven decides to travel there and steal it.  In the house of light, he finds a young woman living with her father and plays the first of many tricks.  He turns himself into a small speck of dirt, slips into her drinking water, and is swallowed.  The daughter becomes pregnant and she gave birth to an unusual and fussy child who cries constantly and demands to touch one of the bundles which has been stored hanging from the walls.  The child is given one of the bags to quiet him, but when he tires of playing with it, he lets it go, and it floats away from him and disappears through the [[smoke hole]].  Once it reaches the sky the bundle comes undone and scatters stars across the sky.  When the child cries to have it back again he is given the second bundle to play with and lets it float away through the hole in the ceiling, thus releasing the moon.  It all happens again with the third and last bundle, which flies away and becomes sunlight.  After bringing light to the whole world, he too flies out through the smoke hole.&lt;ref name="thompson1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Stith|title=Tales of the North American Indians|date=1929|publisher=Harvard Univ.

In  Tahltan stories, Raven is referred to as Big-Crow (''Tse'sketco'' or ''tceski'tco'', "big raven" - from ''tceski'a'', "raven").&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|198}}

=====The Birth of Raven=====
They claim that Big-Crow was born miraculously as the youngest of many brothers in the northern [[Tlingit]] country and was raised speaking the local language.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|198}}  He was separated from his father at birth and his father is never spoken of in all of their stories.  Raven was born, the third child of a woman whose previous two boys were killed by her uncle.  Each time the woman gave birth, her uncle would offer to teach them to hunt once they were old enough; each time he would take them out on a canoe and trick them, he would instruct the boys to sit on the edge of the canoe, at which point he would rock the canoe, forcing them to fall into the water where he would leave them to drown.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|199}}

But her third child was Raven who took well to carving.  Just as he'd done 2 times before, her uncle asked if he could teach Raven how to hunt after he'd grown a few years.  Several times she refused her uncle until Raven insisted that she allow him to go.  So they went out to sea and the same scenario played out.  Raven fell into the water but rather than drown, he took one of the toy canoes he had carved and made it grow into a full size canoe.  He went straight back to his mother and told of what his uncle had done.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

Twice more the uncle tried to drown Raven in the same manner but Raven outsmarted him each time until the uncle gave up and no longer took Raven hunting but would go alone.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

As Raven grew into a man, he met the uncle's wife where he tried to play with her.  He tickled the girl and two birds flew out from under her arms, a bluejay and a woodpecker; and the girl died.  When the uncle returned from his hunt, he saw that his wife had died and he intended to kill Raven again, but this time in rage rather than trickery.  But once again, Raven escaped with his canoe carvings.  But when Raven escaped this time, he did not return home and his journey began; never to return to his home.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|200}}

He starting off travelling by canoe along the seashore all alone but would stop whenever he came upon a village.  When he met people whom he saw take advantage of others or use their power for evil, he would kill in his efforts to deprive them of power.&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|199}}

Raven travelled for many years along the coast of the Tlingit territory, first travelling south, having started in the north until he had gone so far south, beyond Tlingit territory until he reached the Mink people at which point he turned around and continued back the other direction.  He did this north south, south north journey for several years.  Not until his work along the coast was done, did he head inland along the [[Stikine]] river all the way to its source.  He also traveled along the [[Nass River|Nass]], [[Skeena River|Skeena]], and [[Taku River|Taku]] Rivers and all of their many streams never staying in one place for very long and never traveling far off from the water ways.  Through his inland journeys he met the [[Kaska people|Kaska]], the [[Haida people|Haida]], and other nations to the east.&lt;ref name="sams"/&gt;

Later in life, when Raven had done all the work he could do, he travelled back out to the coastal regions guided by the setting sun until he disappeared mysteriously.  The only suggestion is that he may have gone to live with the Kanu'gu and other ancient gods on an island far out into the ocean where they believed weather was created from.&lt;ref name="sams"/&gt;

===Inuit===
The [[Inuit]] are native to the [[Canadian Arctic]] and [[Greenland]]. Among Inuit tradition the owl, fish, and raven are of greatest prominence.  Ravens are also common in the artwork of the Inuit and they have several stories that tell of Raven's birth which is often juxtaposed with the owl with whom Raven shared a deep friendship.&lt;ref name="skinner"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Inuit Views of Nature|first1=Kelly|last1=Skinner|first2=Laura|last2=Brill|publisher=St. Lawrence University|url=http://www.stlawu.edu/gallery/exhibitions/f/11nipirasait/skinner-brill.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

The [[Inuit]] say that Raven was born out of the darkness. He was weak and lost. As he began traveling aimlessly experiencing the world, he realized that he was the Raven Father, Creator of All Life. Once he realized who he was, he gathered up his strength and flew out of the darkness to a new place which he called earth, but he was still alone, so he decided to create plants. As he flew around exploring this new world, he came upon a man whom the legend claims was the first of the Inuit people. Raven fed the man and taught the man to respect the world around him. Soon after, a woman came to be and Raven taught the both of them how to cloth themselves, build shelter, and make canoes to travel the water. As the two bred and spawned children, Raven cared for their children and educated them as he had done before.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

===Haida===
[[File:Raven and the First Men, left side.jpg|thumb|[[Bill Reid]]'s ''Raven and The First Men'' (1980), [[UBC Museum of Anthropology]], depicts a scene from the Haida creation myth. The Raven represents both the creator and trickster figures, common to many mythologies.]]
The [[Haida people|Haida]] people live in [[British Columbia]].  To The Haida, Raven was the Bringer of Light and before Raven the world was nothing more than a gigantic flood.  Raven was the Maker of Things, as well as the Transformer, Magician and Healer.&lt;ref name="eco"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ravenecoventures.com/aboutstory.php?lang=eng|title=The Story of the Raven|website=Raven Eco Ventures|year=2004|access-date=4 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222115738/http://www.ravenecoventures.com/aboutstory.php?lang=eng|archive-date=22 December 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Raven was bored of the world being nothing but water and decided to fly as the waters receded.  Once Raven became hungry, land was formed so he could land and find food.  It was at this point he noticed strange sounds coming from a gigantic clam shell.  Confused as to the sound, Raven decided he would begin singing to the clam shell in response to its sound, hoping to calm it with his pleasant sounds.  Raven did this because he was a beautiful singer.  Finally, a small creature emerged from the clam shell.  It had long black hair, a round head, brown smooth skin and two legs like Raven but no feathers.  This was the first of the First People.&lt;ref name="kenny"&gt;{{cite AV media|medium=Keynote presentation|accessdate=4 September 2014|first1=Kenny|last1=Carolyn|date=June 1994|series=Our Legacy: Work and Play|place=Annual conference of the American Association for Music Therapy|title=Connections: Integrating our Work and play|url=https://essexmyth.files.wordpress.com/2011/06/haida-talk.doc|volume=4|number=2|format=DOC}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When he got bored with them, he considered returning them to their shell, but opted instead to find female counterparts of these male beings. The raven found some female humans trapped in a [[chiton]], freed them, and was entertained as the two sexes met and began to interact. The Raven felt responsible and very protective of them, thus many Haida myths and legends often suggest the raven as a provider to mankind and combine the roles of the creator and the trickster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prezi.com/mqtalthcz5xg/raven-creation/|title=Raven Creation|accessdate=8 September 2014|first1=Darren A.|last1=Svitko|first2=Jessica A|last2=Rosado|publisher=Prezi Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other versions that tells of a different creation.  When the earth was only sky and water with a single reef that rose out of the water where all of the great beings lived with the greatest of them living at the highest point on the reef and the weakest of them living at the bottom.  But Raven flew above them all and could never find a place to land.  For that reason he decided to travel to the sky country where he met the Chief's daughter who had recently had a child.  While it was dark, Raven possessed the baby and intended to take its place as Raven Child.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

One ancient story told on [[Haida Gwaii]] tells about how Raven helped to bring the Sun, Moon, Stars, Fresh Water, and Fire to the world:&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Ella E.: ''Indian Legends of the Pacific Northwest'', [[University of California Press]], 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|Long ago, near the beginning of the world, Gray Eagle was the guardian of the Sun, Moon and Stars, of fresh water, and of fire. Gray Eagle hated people so much that he kept these things hidden. People lived in darkness, without fire and without fresh water.

Gray Eagle had a beautiful daughter, and Raven fell in love with her. In the beginning, Raven was a snow-white bird, and as such, he pleased Gray Eagle's daughter. She invited him to her father's longhouse.

When Raven saw the Sun, Moon and stars, and fresh water hanging on the sides of Eagle's lodge, he knew what he should do. He watched for his chance to seize them when no one was looking. He stole all of them, and a brand of fire also, and flew out of the longhouse through the smoke hole. As soon as Raven got outside he hung the Sun up in the sky. It made so much light that he was able to fly far out to an island in the middle of the ocean. When the Sun set, he fastened the Moon up in the sky and hung the stars around in different places. By this new light he kept on flying, carrying with him the fresh water and the brand of fire he had stolen.

He flew back over the land. When he had reached the right place, he dropped all the water he had stolen. It fell to the ground and there became the source of all the fresh-water streams and lakes in the world. Then Raven flew on, holding the brand of fire in his bill. The smoke from the fire blew back over his white feathers and made them black. When his bill began to burn, he had to drop the firebrand. It struck rocks and hid itself within them. That is why, if you strike two stones together, sparks of fire will drop out.

Raven's feathers never became white again after they were blackened by the smoke from the firebrand. That is why Raven is now a black bird.}}

Amongst the [[Sierra Miwok|Northern Miwok]] of what is now [[Central California]] the story of Raven begins with a world covered in water except for a single mountain top where people had gathered during the flooding of the world.  As the waters receded the people tried to come down from the mountain but the land was so soft with mud that those that tried would sink into the ground.  Wherever a person sank, a raven would come and stand on that spot.  One raven at each hole.

===Puget Sound===
Another raven story from the [[Puget Sound]] region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally ''bird land'') that existed before the world of humans. One day the Raven became so bored with ''bird land'' that he flew away, carrying a stone in his beak. When the Raven became tired of carrying the stone and dropped it, the stone fell into the ocean and expanded until it formed the firmament on which humans now live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John|title=The raven tattoo on my right leg|url=http://people.tribe.net/carpenternj/blog/91f6acb2-835e-4086-bbc2-994e637b98de|accessdate=8 September 2014|date=26 November 2011|quote=A raven story from the Puget Sound region describes the "Raven" as having originally lived in the land of spirits (literally bird land)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910202842/http://people.tribe.net/carpenternj/blog/91f6acb2-835e-4086-bbc2-994e637b98de|archive-date=10 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published source|date=October 2014}}

===Quileute===

The [[Quileute]] are a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people in western [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] state in the United States, currently numbering approximately 2000. Their language belongs to the [[Chimakuan languages|Chimakuan]] family of languages.

The native name for Raven among the Quileute is Báyaḳ (''By''-yuhk).&lt;ref name="quileuteschool"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Raven Tales:Traditional Quileute Stories of Bayak, the Trickster|last1=Woodruff, Sr|first1=Fred|editor1=Jensen, Vickie|editor2=Powell, Jay|url=http://www.quileutenation.org/images/stories/culture/raventales.pdf|format=PDF|website=Quileute River Classroom|publisher=Quileute Tribal School of the Quileute Nation|location=La Push, Washington|access-date=3 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083755/http://www.quileutenation.org/images/stories/culture/raventales.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

Quileute Indians were the southernmost group along the Pacific Coast whose mythology included several stories of the Raven.  Though the Quileute's primary protagonist was not the Raven, but Kweeti, whose stories can be very closely related to similar stories of the [[Tlingit]] involving the Raven.&lt;ref name="quileuteschool"/&gt;{{rp|6}}

The Raven, amongst the Quileute people, is used to tell scary stories to children of how Raven's feet {{rp|226}}&lt;ref name="livingston32"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Journal of American Folk-Lore|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=32|issue=124|pages=251|first1=Livingston|last1=Farrand|first2=Theresa|last2=Mayer|editor=Boas, Franz|date=1920|doi=10.2307/534981|jstor=534981}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|259}} look the way they do; others pursued children to be generous rather than selfish, or to be true to themselves and work hard rather than trying to take shortcuts. In their stories Raven is often punished, or must witness suffering by the people whom he cares for as a result of his trickery.&lt;ref name="quileuteschool"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

In the Quileute story of Duskeah&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|255}}

In the first story of "Kweeti" the story goes "At [[Neah Bay]] he taught them to fish, as all men do. He traversed the whole world." which is compared to the Tlingit story "Raven teaches people their mode of life".&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|252}}

Again in the story of the "Kweeti and the Wolves", "Finally, when the wolves had all but caught him, Kweeti urinated and made Ozetta Lake." which is compared to "Raven Creates Rivers".&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|254}}

But in one story, Raven and Kweeti meet and Kweed entertains Raven.&lt;ref name="livingston32"/&gt;{{rp|259–260}}

===Tlingit===
[[File:Tlingit-map.png|thumb|right|Tlingit and neighboring peoples]]&lt;!-- geography of tribes to each other is important --&gt;
&lt;!--[[File:Tlingit dancers.jpg|thumb|right|Tlingit tribal dancers dancing around [[totem pole]]s featuring Raven]]--&gt;

[[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] territory is in Southeast Alaska.&lt;ref name=tlingit-geo&gt;{{cite web|title=The Raven Story|url=http://www.echospace.org/articles/131/sections/197.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of their territory is in present-day Canada.

The Tlingit call Raven Katce'de but it is disputed whether this derives from the name of another place in the region named Kate, meaning "cedar-bark" or from Tlingitka, signifying "man" or "people"&lt;ref name="teit"/&gt;{{rp|207}}

In Tlingit culture, there are two different raven characters which can be identified, although they are not always clearly differentiated. One is the creator raven, responsible for bringing the world into being and who is sometimes considered to be the individual who brought light to the darkness. The other is the childish raven, always selfish, sly, conniving, and hungry. When the [[Great Spirit]] created all things he kept them separate and stored in cedar boxes. The Great Spirit gifted these boxes to the animals who existed before humans. When the animals opened the boxes all the things that comprise the world came into being. The boxes held such things as mountains, fire, water, wind and seeds for all the plants. One such box, which was given to [[Seagull]], contained all the light of the world. Seagull coveted his box and refused to open it, clutching it under his wing.  All the people asked Raven to persuade Seagull to open it and release the light.  Despite begging, demanding, flattering and trying to trick him into opening the box, Seagull still refused.  Raven became angry and frustrated, and stuck a thorn in Seagull's foot.  Raven pushed the thorn in deeper until the pain caused Seagull to drop the box.  Then out of the box came the sun, moon and stars that brought light to the world and allowed the first day to begin.&lt;ref name=swanton&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swanton|first1=John|title=Tlingit Myths and Texts|journal=Smithsonian Institution.

In one version Raven leads its owner to believe he has soiled his bed in his sleep and threatens to shame him unless he shares his water with Raven.  In another version Raven puts ash on his tongue to fool the owner to believe his extreme thirst is unquenched.  Instead of drinking the water Raven collects it in a seal's bladder hidden under his clothes and flees with all of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bulletin|url=https://si-pddr.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/15466/bulletin1721960smit.pdf.txt;jsessionid=4925B968BFDDF2F0BD32104C4228C24E?sequence=2|publisher=Bureau of American Ethnology|accessdate=3 September 2014|page=72|quote=Emmons also published petro-glyphs on Lisiansky Bay, Baranof Island, where the totemic crestsare organized to illustrate the Raven myth of the theft of water|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904001157/https://si-pddr.si.edu/bitstream/handle/10088/15466/bulletin1721960smit.pdf.txt;jsessionid=4925B968BFDDF2F0BD32104C4228C24E?sequence=2|archive-date=4 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tsimshian===
To the [[Tsimshian]], Raven, was known as Txamsem or ''ganhada'' or the Clever One and was accompanied by a brother named Lagabula or Lazy One.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turner|first1=Nancy J.|title=Ancient pathways, ancestral knowledge : ethnobotany and ecological wisdom of Indigenous peoples of northwestern North America|date=2014|pages=256, 259, 263, 273–278, 286, 288|isbn=9780773585409|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpDdAwAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two had been born in a kelp patch and adopted by a Chief's wife and a magical being from the region of [[Prince_Rupert,_British_Columbia|Prince Rupert]] Harbor.  At the time of their birth things such as daylight did not yet exist; only dusk.  Some records contradict this stating that they were of Gispaxloats origin, born of a Gispaxloats Chief who married a beautiful princess.&lt;ref name="vickers"&gt;{{cite thesis|type=Doctorate of Philosophy|title=Ayaawx (Ts'msyen ancestral law): The power of Transformation|date=1993|publisher=University of Victoria|url=http://dspace.library.uvic.ca:8080/bitstream/handle/1828/1299/AyaawxDec16.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86}}

Among their journeys, they traveled to a mountain at the head of the [[Nass River]].  Txamsem, who could transform into anything, and often took the form of a human or bird, turned himself into a pine needle and was consumed by the daughter of the Chief who guarded daylight.  She then gave birth to him as a baby and the baby cried incessantly to play with daylight.  As soon as it was given to the baby in the form of a playful ball, he transformed back into Raven and flew away with it.  He traveled back up the Nass River with daylight and released it; immediately lighting up the river and allowing it to spread all over the world.&lt;ref name=macdonald&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbeau|first1=Marius|last2=Beynon|first2=William|editor1-last=Cove|editor1-first=John J.|editor2-last=MacDonald|editor2-first=George F.|title=Tsimshian narratives|date=1987|publisher=Directorate, Canadian Museum of Civilization|location=Ottawa|isbn=978-0660107615}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}

The most prominent [[culture hero]] for many of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest is Raven.  There are numerous stories, widely distributed which focus on the Raven myth and his adventures to satisfy his insatiable desire to obtain whatever he wants.  The plot of most Raven tales, tell of how Raven is able to use force or trickery to obtain or motivate someone else to relinquish an object he desires.  Throughout his many stories, Raven claims daylight, water, fire, the oceans waves, the olachen, salmon, the soil, and even the weather.&lt;ref name=boas2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boas|first1=Franz|last2=Tate|first2=Henry W.|title=Tsimshian mythology|date=1916|issue=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjxDAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA721|accessdate=3 September 2014|series=Annual report of the Bureau of American Ethnology|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|618}}

Through the Raven tales, people are able to explain why their surrounding environment was the way it was by linking the Raven or his companions as the cause for why various things in the world come about.

Some stories account for the creation of dangerous animals which were transformed from inanimate objects(No 61. p 572), others suggest that men, animals and objects could be turned to stone.(nos89-93).  While other stories suggest how names were attributed to important landmarks, and how significant geographical features came about.

There is a vague mention that Raven was the ancestor of the [[Ganhada|Raven Clan]], but there are no other direct references between Raven and the ancestry of the Indian people.&lt;ref name="boas2"/&gt;{{rp|619}}

===Zuni===
[[File:Coyoteinacanoe.png|thumb|right|The Coyote canoeing up [[Columbia River]]. The Raven shares the [[trickster]] nature with the coyote in Native American mythologies, but for the Zuni people he lacks the negative characteristics.]]
The raven is not a traditional [[fetishism|fetish]] of the [[Zuni people|Zuni]] but he, along with the Macaw play a part in the Zuni story of migration and is carved often in their artwork, typically carved from [[black marble]] though not exclusively.

The Zuni consider Raven to be a prankster but without negative characteristics which they associate with the [[Coyote (mythology)|coyote]].  The Raven's greatest traits are his ability to assist the people in overcoming their failures by offering gentle reminders that anything people have the courage to face, thus too do they have the power to transform.&lt;ref name="zunifetish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zuni Fetish Meanings|url=http://www.zunispirits.com/2006/zunitopics/zunifetishmeanings.html|last1=Riggs|first1=Darlene Meader|series=The Zuni Fetish Story|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern adaptations==
There have been many [[Native Americans in children's literature|children's]] and picture books that recount traditional Raven Tales. These new versions have been criticized for portraying a much "nicer" Raven with little left from the original greedy [[trickster]]. In some stories Raven acts for the good of people and not for himself. In other stories Raven refuses to use force, and sexual themes are edited out. Trickery is in some instances substituted for magic. These newer tales are also written in conventions of Western rather than Native American literature thus conveying the message that native storytellers' ability or style is inferior.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/user/singere/fakelore.html|title=Fakelore, Multiculturalism, and the Ethics of Children's Literature|last=Singer|first=Eliot A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, The [[Smithsonian Institution]] sponsored [[Chris Kientz]] to develop a series of half-hour animated television programs targeted at school children as an entertaining way of educating kids on aboriginal folklore.  The show ''[[Raven Tales (TV series)|Raven Tales]]'' was produced by New Machine Studios working with producer Winadzi James and aired for two seasons with a total of 26 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Award-Winning Animated Series|url=http://www.raventales.com/|publisher=RavenTales (Alberta) Ltd|accessdate=1 September 2014|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raven Tales Episode Guide|url=http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/731/raven-tales|website=Smithsonian Channel|publisher=SNI/SI Networks L.L.C|accessdate=1 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903144001/http://www.smithsonianchannel.com/sc/web/series/731/raven-tales|archive-date=3 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Matt Dembicki produced an anthological graphic novel of the trickster stories, making sure to maintain the cultural integrity of the stories with the help of 21 Native American  story-tellers who were paired directly with several graphic designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Higgins|first1=Jim|title='Trickster Tales': Gladstone, Indian storytellers team with artists|url=http://missoulian.com/lifestyles/territory/trickster-tales-gladstone-indian-storytellers-team-with-artists/article_f517b738-7016-11df-a81d-001cc4c03286.html|publisher=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|accessdate=1 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8252">Between 2009 and 2014, there were large numbers of refugees who were kidnapped and held in [[Sinai]]. Refugees from various countries were transported to Sinai and held hostage by members of [[Bedouin tribe]]s. Typically, the hostages were forced to give up phone numbers of relatives and were tortured with the relatives on the phone, in order to obtain ransoms in the range of $20,000–$40,000. If the families couldn't pay, the hostages were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/beyondslavery/lucia-heisterkamp/tortured-for-ransom-extortion-on-migrant-routes|title=Tortured for ransom: extortion on migrant routes|date=2016-10-05|website=openDemocracy|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;&lt;ref name=guard/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

Many of the hostages, refugees from [[Sudan]], [[Ethiopia]] or [[Eritrea]], paid traffickers for transport to the [[Israel]]i border, hoping to cross into that country. They were instead taken hostage by those they had paid.&lt;ref name=guard/&gt; Others were taken by force from refugee camps in Sudan, as reported by the United Nations Refugee Agency in January 2013.&lt;ref name=un/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] published a report about numerous kidnappings in 2011-2013 in the [[Ash Showak|Shagarab refugee camps]] in eastern Sudan, carried out by members of the [[Rashaida]] tribe, with victims being sold off to gangs in Sinai, where they would be brutally mistreated to extract ransoms.&lt;ref name=ai/&gt; In 2012 Israel constructed a fence at its border to Sinai to keep out African migrants, causing the Rashaida to lose income from transporting refugees to the border; they then started to concentrate on kidnappings instead.&lt;ref name=wp/&gt;

The phenomenon was first documented by Israeli organization [http://hotline.org.il/ Hotline for Refugees and Migrants] in 2010 in a report entitled ''[http://hotline.org.il/en/publication/deadofthewilderness/ In the Dead of the Wilderness].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hotline for Refugees and Migrants  {{!}} "The Dead of the Wilderness": Testimonies from Sinai Desert, 2010|url = http://hotline.org.il/en/publication/deadofthewilderness/|website = hotline.org.il|access-date = 2016-02-24|last = Felix007.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was based on  testimonies they collected from 60 asylum seekers, mostly Eritreans, who had been tortured for ransom in the Sinai desert. Staff and volunteers of the organisation mostly met the survivors in Israeli immigration detention centers where they were visiting recently arrived asylum seekers. Many people arrived with serious injuries, and some women arrived pregnant as a result of  rape. Seriously injured people were immediately taken to hospital upon arrival in Israel.

German journalist [[Michael Obert]] visited the region in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.obert.de/text/sinai&lt;/ref&gt; met a victim and a torturer and talked to an activist of the New Generation Foundation for Human Rights in [[Al-Arish]]. The organization has documented hundreds of cases of mutilated corpses of Africans found in the desert. Obert reported that some Islamist militants were using force to try to stop the kidnapper gangs. He described a lawless and impoverished region where children were looking forward to grow up to become kidnappers.&lt;ref name=sz/&gt;

A 2011 CNN documentary reported on Eritrean refugees who had paid Bedouin traffickers for transport to Israel but were instead held in bondage before their organs were harvested.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt; In 2013 the Al-Arish activist presented photos of corpses from which organs had been professionally removed and claimed to have seen mobile operation units.&lt;ref name="sz" /&gt;

In February 2011, [[Physicians for Human Rights-Israel]] reported that some 190 Eritrean and Ethiopian refugees were being held hostage in Sinai, and that numerous refugee women reported having been raped on their trip to Israel.&lt;ref name="phr" /&gt; In 2013, the same organization estimated that about 1,000 refugees were being held in Sinai hostage camps, and that in total about 7,000 refugees had been abused in these camps, resulting in more than 4,000 deaths.&lt;ref name="sz" /&gt;

In a 2013 report, [[This American Life]] reported on the experiences of journalist Meron Estefanos, who has helped publicize the kidnappings, and helped get some hostages freed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty]] of 1979 limits the number of Egyptian forces that can be deployed in Sinai.&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], security forces largely abandoned the peninsula, but they returned in 2014 to fight unrelated terrorist networks, and the practice of kidnapping refugees moved to Libya and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/502/this-call-may-be-recorded-to-save-your-life|title=This Call May Be Recorded...

'''Reservoir sampling''' is a family of [[randomized algorithm]]s for randomly choosing a [[Sampling (statistics)|sample]] of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; items from a list &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; containing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is either a very large or unknown number. Typically, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is too large to fit the whole list into [[main memory]].

== Example: Sample size 10 ==
Suppose we see a sequence of items, one at a time. We want to keep ten items in memory, and we want them to be selected at random from the sequence. If we know the total number of items &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then the solution is easy: select 10 distinct indices &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; between 1 and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; with equal probability, and keep the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th elements. The problem is that we do not always know the exact &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in advance. A possible solution is the following:
* Keep the first ten items in memory.
* When the {{mvar|i}}-th item arrives (for &lt;math&gt;i&gt;10&lt;/math&gt;):
** with probability &lt;math&gt;10/i&lt;/math&gt;, keep the new item (discard an old one, selecting which to replace at random, each with chance 1/10)
** with probability &lt;math&gt;1-10/i&lt;/math&gt;, keep the old items (ignore the new one)

Thus,
* when there are 10 items or fewer, each is kept with probability 1; 
* when there are 11 items, each of them is kept with probability &lt;math&gt;10/11&lt;/math&gt;; for the old items, that is &lt;math&gt;(1)(1/11 + (10/11)(9/10)) = 1/11 + 9/11 = 10/11&lt;/math&gt;
**In other words, the 10 old items are kept either if the new one is not selected &lt;math&gt;1/11&lt;/math&gt; or the new one is selected to replace one of the other 9 items &lt;math&gt;10/11 \times 9/10&lt;/math&gt;, and since "or" is represented with addition, we derive &lt;math&gt;(1/11 + (10/11)(9/10))&lt;/math&gt;.
* when there are 12 items, the twelfth item is kept with probability &lt;math&gt;10/12&lt;/math&gt;, and each of the previous 11 items are also kept with probability &lt;math&gt;(10/11)(2/12 + (10/12)(9/10)) = (10/11)(11/12) = 10/12 &lt;/math&gt;;
* by induction, it is easy to prove that when there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; items, each item is kept with probability &lt;math&gt;10/n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Algorithm R ==
The most common example was labelled ''Algorithm R'' by [[Jeffrey Vitter]] in his paper on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vitter|first1=Jeffrey S.|title=Random sampling with a reservoir|journal=ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software|date=1 March 1985|volume=11|issue=1|pages=37–57|doi=10.1145/3147.3165|url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~samir/498/vitter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple O(''n'') algorithm as described in the ''Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Reservoir sampling
|work=Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures
|first=Paul E.
|last=Black
|date= 26 January 2015
|accessdate=2017-02-09
|url= https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/reservoirSampling.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; consists of the following steps (assuming ''k &lt; n'' and using one-based array [[Zero-based numbering|indexing]]):

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S has items to sample, R will contain the result
 *)
ReservoirSample(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  // fill the reservoir array
  for i = 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]

  // replace elements with gradually decreasing probability
  for i = k+1 to n
    j := random(1, i)   // important: inclusive range
    if j &lt;= k
        R[j] := S[i]
&lt;/source&gt;

The algorithm creates a "reservoir" array of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and populates it with the first &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; items of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. It then iterates through the remaining elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; until &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is exhausted. At the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the algorithm generates a random number &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; between 1 and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of the reservoir array is replaced with the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. In effect, for all &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be included in the reservoir with probability &lt;math&gt;k/i&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, at each iteration the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} element of the reservoir array is chosen to be replaced with probability &lt;math&gt;1/k * k/i&lt;/math&gt;, which simplifies to &lt;math&gt;1/i&lt;/math&gt;. It can be shown that when the algorithm has finished executing, each item in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has equal probability (i.e. &lt;math&gt;k/length(S)&lt;/math&gt;) of being chosen for the reservoir.

To see this, consider the following proof by [[Mathematical induction|induction]]. After the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round, let us assume, the probability of a number being in the reservoir array is &lt;math&gt;k/(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the probability of the number being replaced in the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round is &lt;math&gt;1/i&lt;/math&gt;, the probability that it survives the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round is &lt;math&gt;(i-1)/i&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the probability that a given number is in the reservoir after the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round is the product of these two probabilities, i.e. the probability of being in the reservoir after the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;(i-1)&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round, and surviving replacement in the {{ordinal|&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;|sup=yes}} round. This is &lt;math&gt;(k/(i-1)) * ((i-1)/i)=k/i&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the result holds for &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and is therefore true by induction.

== Reservoir with Random Sort ==
A simple reservoir-based algorithm can be designed using random sort&lt;ref name=Sunter1977&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sunter|first1=A. B.|title=List Sequential Sampling with Equal or Unequal Probabilities without Replacement|journal=Applied Statistics|date=1977|volume=26|issue=3|pages=261|doi=10.2307/2346966}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implemented using priority queue data structure. This algorithm assigns random number as keys to each item and maintain k items with minimum value for keys. In essence, this is equivalent to assigning a random number to each item as key, sorting items using these keys and taking top k items. The worse case run time of the algorithm is &lt;math&gt;O(n \log k)&lt;/math&gt; while the best case runtime is &lt;math&gt;O(n)&lt;/math&gt;. Even though the worse case runtime is not as good as Algorithm R, this algorithm can easily be extended to weighted sampling. Note that both algorithms can operate on streams of unspecified lengths.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S is a stream of items to sample, R will contain the result
  S.Current returns current item in stream
  S.Next advances stream to next position
  min-priority-queue supports:
    Count -&gt; number of items in priority queue
    Minimum -&gt; returns minimum key value of all items
    Extract-Min() -&gt; Remove the item with min key
    Insert(key, Item) -&gt; Adds item with specified key
 *)
ReservoirSample(S[1..?], R[1..k])
  H = new min-priority-queue
  while S has data
    r = Random(0,1)
    if H.Count &lt; k
      H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    else
      if H.Minimum &lt; r
        H.Extract-Min()
        H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    S.Next
&lt;/source&gt;

== Weighted Random Sampling using Reservoir ==
In many applications sampling is required to be according to the weights that are assigned to each items available in set. For example, it might be required to sample queries in a search engine with weight as number of times they were performed so that the sample can be analyzed for overall impact on user experience. There are two ways to interpret weights assigned to each item in the set:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Weighted random sampling with a reservoir|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002001900500298X|journal = Information Processing Letters|date = 2006-03-16|pages = 181–185|volume = 97|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.ipl.2005.11.003|first = Pavlos S.|last = Efraimidis|first2 = Paul G.|last2 = Spirakis}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Let the weight of each item be &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and sum of all weights be {{mvar|W}}. We can convert weight to probability of item getting selected in sample as &lt;math&gt;P_i = w_i / W&lt;/math&gt;.
# Let the weight of two items {{mvar|i}} and {{mvar|j}} be &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;. Let the probability of item {{mvar|i}} getting selected in sample be &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, then we give &lt;math&gt;p_j = \min(1, p_i \frac{w_j}{w_i})&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Algorithm A-Res ===
The following algorithm was given by Efraimidis and Spirakis that uses interpretation 1:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S is a stream of items to sample, R will contain the result
  S.Current returns current item in stream
  S.Weight  returns weight of current item in stream
  S.Next advances stream to next position
  The power operator is represented by ^
  min-priority-queue supports:
    Count -&gt; number of items in priority queue
    Minimum() -&gt; returns minimum key value of all items
    Extract-Min() -&gt; Remove the item with minimum key
    Insert(key, Item) -&gt; Adds item with specified key
 *)
ReservoirSample(S[1..?], R[1..k])
  H = new min-priority-queue
  while S has data
    r = Random(0,1) ^ (1/S.Weight)  // important: inclusive range
    if H.Count &lt; k
      H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    else
      if H.Minimum &lt; r
        H.Extract-Min()
        H.Insert(r, S.Current)
    S.Next
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;This algorithm is identical to the algorithm given in [[Reservoir sampling#Reservoir with Random Sort|Reservoir Sampling with Random Sort]] except for the line how we generate the key using random number generator. The algorithm is equivalent to assigning each item a key &lt;math&gt;r^{1/w_i}&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|r}} is the random number and then sort items using these keys and finally select top k items for the sample.

=== Algorithm A-Chao ===
Following algorithm was given by M. T. Chao uses interpretation 2:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S has items to sample, R will contain the result
  S[i].Weight contains weight for each item
 *)
WeightedReservoir-Chao(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  WSum = 0
  // fill the reservoir array
  for i = 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]
      WSum = WSum + S[i].Weight/k
  for i = k+1 to n
    WSum = WSum + S[i].Weight/k
    p = S[i].Weight / WSum // probability for this item
    j := random(0, 1);     // important: inclusive range
    if j &lt;= p              // select item according to probability
        R[random(1,k)] := S[i]  //uniform selection in reservoir for replacement

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;For each item, its relative weight is calculated and used to randomly decide if the item will be added into the reservoir. If the item is selected, then one of the existing items of the reservoir is uniformly selected and replaced with the new item. The trick here is that, if the probabilities of all items in the reservoir are already proportional to their weights, then by selecting uniformly which item to replace, the probabilities of all items remain proportional to their weight after the replacement.

== Distributed Reservoir Sampling ==
In many applications, amount of data from which a small sample is needed is too large and it is desirable to distribute sampling tasks among many machines in parallel to speed up the process. A simple approach that is often used, although less performant, is to assign a random number as key to each item and then perform a distributed sort and finally obtain a sample of desired size from top k items. If weighted sample is desired then key is computed using &lt;math&gt;r^{1/w_i}&lt;/math&gt; where {{mvar|r}} is the random number and &lt;math&gt;w_i&lt;/math&gt; is the weight of an item. The inefficiency in this approach obviously arises from required distributed sort on very large amount of data.

Another more efficient approach for distributed weighted random sampling is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gregable: Reservoir Sampling - Sampling from a stream of elements|url = http://gregable.com/2007/10/reservoir-sampling.html|website = gregable.com|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Distribute data among m machines.
# Each machine does its own weighted sampling using key &lt;math&gt;r^{1/w_i}&lt;/math&gt; as described in previous section and produces a sample of size &lt;= k items. 
# Collects all m samples of size &lt;= k. We should have total items &lt;math&gt;n' &lt;= mk&lt;/math&gt;.
# Now sample k items from &lt;math&gt;n'&lt;/math&gt; items from step 3 using key that was already computed in Step 2. This means instead of re-generating key using random number generator in sampling algorithm, we use the key we already had assigned in step 2.
The Step 4 uses keys from Step 2 because we might have unbalanced data distribution on machines. For example, lets say k = 1, machine m1 only gets 1 item with weight 10 while machine m2 gets 2 items each with weight 100. Intuitively probability for items from m1 getting in final sample is 10/210. In Step 3, we will get 1 item from m1 as well as m2. If we recalculate keys in step 4 then the probability that item from m1 will be in final sample is 10/110 instead of required 10/210. Now observe that weighted reservoir sampling algorithm from previous section decreases max key value in priority queue as it processes more items. Therefore, items sampled from machine with larger chunk will have lower key values and thus higher chance of getting selected.

== Relation to Fisher-Yates shuffle ==
Suppose one wanted to draw ''k'' random cards from a deck of playing cards (i.e., ''n=52'').
A natural approach would be to shuffle the deck and then take the top ''k'' cards.
In the general case, the shuffle also needs to work even if the number of cards in the deck is not known in advance, a condition which is satisfied by the inside-out version of the [[Fisher-Yates shuffle]]:

   To initialize an array ''a'' of ''n'' elements to a randomly shuffled copy of ''S'', both 0-based: &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[0] &amp;#8592; ''S''[0] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 1 '''to''' ''n'' - 1 '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''r'' &amp;#8592; ''random'' (0 .. ''i'') &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''i''] &amp;#8592; ''a''[''r''] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''r''] &amp;#8592; ''S''[''i'']

Note that although the rest of the cards are shuffled, only the top ''k'' are important in the present context.
Therefore, the array ''a'' need only track the cards in the top ''k'' positions while performing the shuffle, reducing the amount of memory needed.
Truncating ''a'' to length ''k'', the algorithm is modified accordingly:
   To initialize an array ''a'' to ''k'' random elements of ''S'' (which is of length ''n''), both 0-based: &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[0] &amp;#8592; ''S''[0] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' '''from''' 1 '''to''' ''k'' - 1 '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''r'' &amp;#8592; ''random'' (0 .. ''i'') &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''i''] &amp;#8592; ''a''[''r''] &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''a''[''r''] &amp;#8592; ''S''[''i'']  &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''for''' ''i'' '''from''' k '''to''' ''n'' - 1 '''do''' &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''r'' &amp;#8592; ''random'' (0 .. ''i'') &lt;br /&gt;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''if''' (''r'' &lt; ''k'') '''then''' ''a''[''r''] &amp;#8592; ''S''[''i'']

Since the order of the first ''k'' cards is immaterial, the first loop can be removed and ''a'' can be initialized to be the first ''k'' items of ''S''.
This yields ''Algorithm R''.

== Fast Approximation ==

A [https://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/11/20/very-fast-reservoir-sampling/ fast approximation] to reservoir sampling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = https://erikerlandson.github.io/blog/2015/11/20/very-fast-reservoir-sampling/ |title = Very Fast Reservoir Sampling |last1 = Erlandson |first1 = Erik J. |date = 2015-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Uses a good-quality approximation to the sampling-gap distribution to skip over the gaps; i.e. consecutive runs of data that
are not sampled.

&lt;source lang="pascal"&gt;
(*
  S has items to sample, R will contain the result
  The reservoir size is (k)
 *)
FastApproximateReservoirSample(S[1..n], R[1..k])
  // fill the reservoir array
  for i = 1 to k
      R[i] := S[i]

  // Threshold (t) determines when to start fast sampling logic
  // The optimal value for (t) may vary depending on RNG performance characteristics
  t := 4 * k

  // Normal reservoir sampling is fastest up to (t) samples
  i := 1 + k
  while (i &lt;= n  &amp;&amp;  i &lt;= t)
    j := random(1, i)  // integer from 1 to i, inclusive
    if j &lt;= k
        R[j] := S[i]
    i := i + 1

  // Once gap sizes become significant, it pays to use
  // fast sampling using an approximate sampling gap distribution
  while (i &lt;= n)
    // draw gap size (g) from geometric distribution with probability p = k / i
    p := k / i
    u := randomFloat() // random float &gt; 0.0 and &lt;= 1.0
    g := floor(log(u) / log(1-p))
    // advance over the gap, and assign next element to the reservoir
    i := i + g
    if (i &lt;= n)
      j := random(1, k)  // integer 1 to k, inclusive
      R[j] := S[i]
      i := i + 1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example implementation ==
The following is a simple implementation of the algorithm in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] that samples the set of English Wikipedia page titles:
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
import random
SAMPLE_COUNT = 10

# Force the value of the seed so the results are repeatable
random.seed(12345)

sample_titles = []
for index, line in enumerate(open("enwiki-20091103-all-titles-in-ns0")):
        # Generate the reservoir
        if index &lt; SAMPLE_COUNT:
                sample_titles.append(line)
        else:
                # Randomly replace elements in the reservoir
                # with a decreasing probability.
                # Choose an integer between 0 and index (inclusive)
                r = random.randint(0, index)
                if r &lt; SAMPLE_COUNT:
                        sample_titles[r] = line
print sample_titles
&lt;/source&gt;

== Statistical properties ==
Probabilities of selection of the reservoir methods are discussed in Chao (1982)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/69/3/653.abstract Chao, M.T. (1982) A general purpose unequal probability sampling plan. Biometrika, 69 (3): 653-656.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Tillé (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Sampling-Algorithms-Springer-Series-Statistics/dp/0387308148 Tillé, Y. (2006). Sampling Algorithms. Springer]&lt;/ref&gt; While the first-order selection probabilities are equal to &lt;math&gt;k/n&lt;/math&gt; (or, in case of Chao's procedure, to an arbitrary set of unequal probabilities), the second order selection probabilities depend on the order in which the records are sorted in the original reservoir. The problem is overcome by the [[cube sampling]] method of Deville and Tillé (2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/91/4/893.short Deville, J.-C., and Y. Tillé (2004). Efficient balanced sampling: The cube method. Biometrika 91 (4): 893-912.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
Reservoir sampling makes the assumption that the desired sample fits into [[main memory]], often implying that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a constant independent of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. In applications where we would like to select a large subset of the input list (say a third, i.e. &lt;math&gt;k=n/3&lt;/math&gt;), other methods need to be adopted. Distributed implementations for this problem have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://had00b.blogspot.com/2013/07/random-subset-in-mapreduce.html Reservoir Sampling in MapReduce]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-replication''' is any behavior of a [[dynamical system]] that yields construction of an identical copy of itself. [[Cell (biology)|Biological cell]]s, given suitable environments, reproduce by [[cell division]]. During cell division, [[DNA]] is replicated and can be transmitted to offspring during [[reproduction]]. [[virus (biology)|Biological viruses]] can [[Viral replication|replicate]], but only by commandeering the reproductive machinery of cells through a process of infection. Harmful [[prion]] proteins can replicate by converting normal proteins into rogue forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8435320.stm |title='Lifeless' prion proteins are 'capable of evolution' |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Computer virus]]es reproduce using the hardware and software already present on computers. Self-replication in [[robotics]] has been an area of research and a subject of interest in [[science fiction]]. Any self-replicating mechanism which does not make a perfect copy (Mutation&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mutation|date=2018-11-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mutation&amp;oldid=867900912|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) will experience [[genetic variation]] and will create variants of itself. These variants will be subject to [[natural selection]], since some will be better at surviving in their current environment than others and will out-breed them.

==Overview==

===Theory===
{{See also|Von Neumann universal constructor}}

Early research by [[John von Neumann]]&lt;ref name=Hixon_vonNeumann&gt;{{cite book|last=von Neumann|first=John|title=The Hixon Symposium|year=1948|location=Pasadena, California|pages=1–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; established that replicators have several parts:

*A coded representation of the replicator
*A mechanism to copy the coded representation
*A mechanism for effecting construction within the host environment of the replicator

Exceptions to this pattern may be possible, although none have yet been achieved.  For example, scientists have come close to  constructing [https://arstechnica.com/science/2011/04/investigations-into-the-ancient-rna-world/ RNA that can be copied] in an "environment" that is a solution of RNA monomers and transcriptase.  In this case, the body is the genome, and the specialized copy mechanisms are external.  The requirement for an outside copy mechanism has not yet been overcome, and such systems are more accurately characterized as "assisted replication" than "self-replication".

However, the simplest possible case is that only a genome exists.  Without some specification of the self-reproducing steps, a genome-only system is probably better characterized as something like a [[crystal]].

===Classes of self-replication===
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | last = Freitas | first = Robert | last2 = Merkle | first2 = Ralph | title = Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines - General Taxonomy of Replicators}}&lt;/ref&gt; has begun to categorize replicators, often based on the amount of support they require.

*Natural replicators have all or most of their design from nonhuman sources. Such systems include natural life forms.
*[[Autotroph]]ic replicators can reproduce themselves "in the wild".  They mine their own materials. It is conjectured that non-biological autotrophic replicators could be designed by humans, and could easily accept specifications for human products.
*Self-reproductive systems are conjectured systems which would produce copies of themselves from industrial feedstocks such as metal bar and wire.
*Self-assembling systems assemble copies of themselves from finished, delivered parts. Simple examples of such systems have been demonstrated at the macro scale.

The design space for machine replicators is very broad. A comprehensive study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/5.1.9.htm | date = 2004 | accessdate = 29 June 2013 | last1 = Freitas | first1 = Robert | last2 = Merkle | first2 = Ralph | title = Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines - Freitas-Merkle Map of the Kinematic Replicator Design Space (2003–2004)}}&lt;/ref&gt; to date by [[Robert Freitas]] and [[Ralph Merkle]] has identified 137 design dimensions grouped into a dozen separate categories, including: (1) Replication Control, (2) Replication Information, (3) Replication Substrate, (4) Replicator Structure, (5) Passive Parts, (6) Active Subunits, (7) Replicator Energetics, (8) Replicator Kinematics, (9) Replication Process, (10) Replicator Performance, (11) Product Structure, and (12) Evolvability.

===A self-replicating computer program===
{{Main article|Quine (computing)}}

In [[computer science]] a [[Quine (computing)|quine]] is a self-reproducing computer program that, when executed, outputs its own code. For example, a quine in the [[Python (programming language)|Python programming language]] is:

:&lt;code&gt;a='a=%r;print a%%a';print a%a&lt;/code&gt;

A more trivial approach is to write a program that will make a copy of any stream of data that it is directed to, and then direct it at itself. In this case the program is treated as both executable code, and as data to be manipulated. This approach is common in most self-replicating systems, including biological life, and is simpler as it does not require the program to contain a complete description of itself.

In many programming languages an empty program is legal, and executes without producing errors or other output. The output is thus the same as the source code, so the program is trivially self-reproducing.

===Self-replicating tiling===
{{See also|Self-similarity}}

In [[geometry]] a self-replicating tiling is a tiling pattern in which several [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] tiles may be joined together to form a larger tile that is similar to the original.  This is an aspect of the field of study known as [[tessellation]].  The "sphinx" [[hexiamond]] is the only known self-replicating [[pentagon]].&lt;ref&gt;For an image that does not show how this replicates, see: Eric W. Weisstein. "Sphinx." From MathWorld--A Wolfram Web Resource. [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Sphinx.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, four such [[concave polygon|concave]] pentagons can be joined together to make one with twice the dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;For further illustrations, see [http://www.geoaustralia.com/italian/Sphinx/Guide.html Teaching TILINGS / TESSELLATIONS with Geo Sphinx]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Solomon W. Golomb]] coined the term [[rep-tiles]] for self-replicating tilings.

In 2012, [[Lee Sallows]] identified rep-tiles as a special instance of a [[self-tiling tile set]] or setiset. A setiset of order ''n'' is a set of ''n'' shapes that can be assembled in ''n'' different ways so as to form larger replicas of themselves. Setisets in which every shape is distinct are called 'perfect'.  A rep-''n'' rep-tile is just a setiset composed of ''n'' identical pieces.

===Applications===
It is a long-term goal of some engineering sciences to achieve a [[clanking replicator]], a material device that can self-replicate.  The usual reason is to achieve a low cost per item while retaining the utility of a manufactured good.  Many authorities say that in the limit, the cost of self-replicating items should approach the cost-per-weight of wood or other biological substances, because self-replication avoids the costs of [[labour (economics)|labor]], [[Capital (economics)|capital]] and [[distribution (business)|distribution]] in conventional [[factory|manufactured goods]].

A fully novel artificial replicator is a reasonable near-term goal.
A [[NASA]] study recently placed the complexity of a [[clanking replicator]] at approximately that of [[Intel]]'s [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] 4 CPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niac.usra.edu/files/studies/final_report/883Toth-Fejel.pdf |title=Modeling Kinematic Cellular Automata Final Report |publisher= |date=April 30, 2004 |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the technology is achievable with a relatively small engineering group in a reasonable commercial time-scale at a reasonable cost.

Given the currently keen interest in biotechnology and the high levels of funding in that field, attempts to exploit the replicative ability of existing cells are timely, and may easily lead to significant insights and advances.

A variation of self replication is of practical relevance in [[compiler]] construction, where a similar [[bootstrapping]] problem occurs as in natural self replication. A compiler ([[phenotype]]) can be applied on the compiler's own [[source code]] ([[genotype]]) producing the compiler itself. During compiler development, a modified ([[Mutation|mutated]]) source is used to create the next generation of the compiler. This process differs from natural self-replication in that the process is directed by an engineer, not by the subject itself.

==Mechanical self-replication==
{{Main article|self-replicating machine}}

An activity in the field of robots is the self-replication of machines. Since all robots (at least in modern times) have a fair number of the same features, a self-replicating robot (or possibly a hive of robots) would need to do the following:

*Obtain construction materials
*Manufacture new parts including its smallest parts and thinking apparatus
*Provide a consistent power source
*Program the new members
*error correct any mistakes in the offspring

On a [[Nanotechnology|nano]] scale, [[Assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]] might also be designed to self-replicate under their own power. This, in turn, has given rise to the "[[grey goo]]" version of [[Armageddon]], as featured in such science fiction novels as ''[[Bloom (novel)|Bloom]]'', ''[[Prey (novel)|Prey]]'', and ''[[Recursion (novel)|Recursion]]''.

The [[Foresight Institute]] has published guidelines for researchers in mechanical self-replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foresight.org/guidelines/ |title=Molecular Nanotechnology Guidelines |publisher=Foresight.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines recommend that researchers use several specific techniques for preventing mechanical replicators from getting out of control, such as using a [[broadcast architecture]].

For a detailed article on mechanical reproduction as it relates to the industrial age see [[mass production]].

==Fields==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2017}}
Research has occurred in the following areas:

* [[Biology]] studies natural replication and replicators, and their interaction.  These can be an important guide to avoid design difficulties in self-replicating machinery.
* In [[Chemistry]] self-replication studies are typically about how a specific set of molecules can act together to replicate each other within the set &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moulin, Giuseppone |title=Dynamic Combinatorial Self-Replicating Systems|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F128_2011_198|year=2011|publisher=Springer|DOI=10.1007/128_2011_198}}&lt;/ref&gt; (often part of [[Systems chemistry]] field).
* [[Meme]]tics studies ideas and how they propagate in human culture.  Memes require only small amounts of material, and therefore have theoretical similarities to [[virus]]es and are often described as [[virus|viral]].
* [[Nanotechnology]] or more precisely, [[molecular nanotechnology]] is concerned with making [[Nanotechnology|nano]] scale [[assembler (nanotechnology)|assemblers]].  Without self-replication, capital and assembly costs of molecular machines become impossibly large.
* Space resources: NASA has sponsored a number of design studies to develop self-replicating mechanisms to mine space resources.  Most of these designs include computer-controlled machinery that copies itself.
* [[Computer security]]: Many computer security problems are caused by self-reproducing computer programs that infect computers — [[computer worm]]s and [[computer virus]]es.
* In [[parallel computing]], it takes a long time to manually load a new program on every node of a large [[computer cluster]] or [[distributed computing]] system. Automatically loading new programs using [[mobile agent]]s can save the system administrator a lot of time and give users their results much quicker, as long as they don't get out of control.

==In industry==

===Space exploration and manufacturing===
The goal of self-replication in space systems is to exploit large amounts of matter with a low launch mass.  For example, an [[autotroph]]ic self-replicating machine could cover a moon or planet with solar cells, and beam the power to the Earth using microwaves.  Once in place, the same machinery that built itself could also produce raw materials or manufactured objects, including transportation systems to ship the products. [[Von Neumann Probe|Another model]] of self-replicating machine would copy itself through the galaxy and universe, sending information back.

In general, since these systems are autotrophic, they are the most difficult and complex known replicators.  They are also thought to be the most hazardous, because they do not require any inputs from human beings in order to reproduce.

A classic theoretical study of replicators in space is the 1980 [[NASA]] study of autotrophic clanking replicators, edited by [[Robert Freitas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Advanced Automation for Space Missions]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the design study was concerned with a simple, flexible chemical system for processing lunar [[regolith]], and the differences between the ratio of elements needed by the replicator, and the ratios available in regolith.  The limiting element was [[Chlorine]], an essential element to process regolith for [[Aluminium]].  Chlorine is very rare in lunar regolith, and a substantially faster rate of reproduction could be assured by importing modest amounts.

The reference design specified small computer-controlled electric carts running on rails.  Each cart could have a simple hand or a small bull-dozer shovel, forming a basic [[robot]].

Power would be provided by a "canopy" of [[solar cell]]s supported on pillars.  The other machinery could run under the canopy.

A "[[casting]] [[robot]]" would use a robotic arm with a few sculpting tools to make [[plaster]] [[molding (process)|mold]]s.  Plaster molds are easy to make, and make precise parts with good surface finishes.  The robot would then cast most of the parts either from non-conductive molten rock ([[basalt]]) or purified metals.  An [[electricity|electric]] [[oven]] melted the materials.

A speculative, more complex "chip factory" was specified to produce the computer and electronic systems, but the designers also said that it might prove practical to ship the chips from Earth as if they were "vitamins".

===Molecular manufacturing===
{{Main article|molecular nanotechnology#Replicating nanorobots}}

[[Nanotechnology|Nanotechnologists]] in particular believe that their work will likely fail to reach a state of maturity until human beings design a self-replicating [[assembler (nanotechnology)|assembler]] of [[nanometer]] dimensions [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/4.11.3.htm].

These systems are substantially simpler than autotrophic systems, because they are provided with purified feedstocks and energy.  They do not have to reproduce them. This distinction is at the root of some of the controversy about whether [[molecular manufacturing]] is possible or not.  Many authorities who find it impossible are clearly citing sources for complex autotrophic self-replicating systems.  Many of the authorities who find it possible are clearly citing sources for much simpler self-assembling systems, which have been demonstrated.  In the meantime, a [[Lego]]-built autonomous robot able to follow a pre-set track and assemble an exact copy of itself, starting from four externally provided components, was demonstrated experimentally in 2003 [http://www.MolecularAssembler.com/KSRM/3.23.4.htm].

Merely exploiting the replicative abilities of existing cells is insufficient, because of limitations in the process of [[protein biosynthesis]] (also see the listing for [[RNA]]).
What is required is the rational design of an entirely novel replicator with a much wider range of synthesis capabilities.

In 2011, New York University scientists have developed artificial structures that can self-replicate, a process that has the potential to yield new types of materials.  They have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate not just molecules like cellular DNA or RNA, but discrete structures that could in principle assume many different shapes, have many different functional features, and be associated with many different types of chemical species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/nature10500 | last1 = Wang | first1 = Tong | last2 = Sha | first2 = Ruojie | last3 = Dreyfus | first3 = Rémi | last4 = Leunissen | first4 = Mirjam E. | last5 = Maass | first5 = Corinna | last6 = Pine | first6 = David J. | last7 = Chaikin | first7 = Paul M. | last8 = Seeman | first8 = Nadrian C. | year = 2011 | title = Self-replication of information-bearing nanoscale patterns | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7368/full/nature10500.html| journal = Nature | volume = 478 | issue = 7368 | pages = 225–228 | pmid=21993758 | pmc=3192504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/10/111012132651.htm | title = Self-replication process holds promise for production of new materials. | date = 17 October 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=17 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Economic, social and cultural rights}}

'''Social rights''' are those [[rights]] arising from the [[social contract]], in contrast to [[natural rights]] which arise from the [[natural law]], but before the establishment of [[legal rights]] by [[positive law]]. For example, [[James Madison]] advocated that a right such as [[trial by jury]] arose neither from nature nor from a [[constitution]] of government, but from [[Concretization|reified]] implications of the [[social contract]].&lt;ref&gt;Introduction of the Bill of Rights in congress, 1789 Jun 8, Jul 21, Aug 13, 18-19; Annals 1:424-50, 661-65, 707-17, 757-59, 766.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cecile Fabre]] argues that "it is legitimate to constrain democratic majorities, by way of the constitution, to respect and promote those fundamental rights of ours that protect the secure exercise of our autonomy and enable us to achieve well-being. Insofar as, by virtue of Ch. 1, social rights are such fundamental rights, it follows that they should be constitutionalized."&lt;ref&gt;Fabre, Cecile. "3. Constitutional Social Rights." Social Rights Under the Constitution 1: 67-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a legal standpoint several approaches exercise and guarantee social rights; social rights under the constitution are rights of subjects or "subject rights". This assures that the public receives equal distribution of collective and private interests.&lt;ref&gt;Societies Without Borders; Jul2009, Vol. 4 Issue 2, p158-174, 17p&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=April 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2455">In [[mathematics]], the '''splitting principle''' is a technique used to reduce questions about [[vector bundle]]s to the case of [[line bundle]]s.

In the theory of vector bundles, one often wishes to simplify computations, say of [[Chern classes]].  Often computations are well understood for line bundles and for direct sums of line bundles.  In this case the splitting principle can be quite useful.  

{{math_theorem|Let &lt;math&gt;\xi\colon E\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; be a vector bundle of rank &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; over a [[paracompact space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.  There exists a space &lt;math&gt;Y=Fl(E)&lt;/math&gt;, called the flag bundle associated to &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and a map &lt;math&gt;p\colon Y\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that 

#the induced cohomology homomorphism &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon H^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and
#the pullback bundle &lt;math&gt;p^*\xi\colon p^*E\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; breaks up as a direct sum of line bundles: &lt;math&gt;p^*(E)=L_1\oplus L_2\oplus\cdots\oplus L_n.&lt;/math&gt;}}

The theorem above holds for complex vector bundles and integer coefficients or for real vector bundles with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_2&lt;/math&gt; coefficients. In the complex case, the line bundles &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt; or their first [[characteristic class]]es are called '''Chern roots.''' 

The fact that &lt;math&gt;p^*\colon H^*(X)\rightarrow H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; is injective means that any equation which holds in &lt;math&gt;H^*(Y)&lt;/math&gt; (say between various Chern classes) also holds in &lt;math&gt;H^*(X)&lt;/math&gt;.  

The point is that these equations are easier to understand for direct sums of line bundles than for arbitrary vector bundles, so equations should be understood in &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; and then pushed down to &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.

==Symmetric polynomial==
Under the splitting principle, characteristic classes for complex vector bundles correspond to [[symmetric polynomials]] in the first Chern classes of complex line bundles; these are the [[Chern class]]es.

[[File:tambunting small blk.png|thumb|right|The current Tambunting logo.]]

'''Tambunting Pawnshop''' is the oldest [[pawnshop]] in the [[Philippines]], operating since 1906. The essence of business in Tambunting Pawnshop is lending money and accepting jewelry or storage (gadgets and appliances), and even mortgages of real estate and pledges of stocks as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]]. Loans are generally for a maximum period of six months, after which the collateral will be sold at auction or through their other jewelry outlets. Tambunting Pawnshop reached its centennial in 2006 and is currently celebrating its 110th anniversary this year.

==History==
Tambunting Pawnshop was established by Don Ildefonso Tan Bunting in 1906. He was a son of a Chinese immigrant from [[Fujian, China]]. He owned horse-drawn carriages that could be seen traveling through the streets of old Manila collecting garbage. The Government paid him just five centavos per trashcan. Over years of hard effort, he was able to accumulate real estate and other small investments. Some of this real estate was located in Divisoria, [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], [[Malabon]] and [[Navotas]].

After years of continuous expansion in his business, Don Ildefonso tried the shipping business, and later started up the original pawnshop in the town of [[Santa Cruz, Manila]] with the name "Casa Agencia de Empeños de Ildefonso Tam Bunting".

By the time of World War II, his pawnshop had expanded to different locations inside and outside [[Metro Manila]]. By the 1990s, the newer generation of the Tambunting family already operated more than 300 branches nationwide. As of this year, Tambunting Pawnshop already has more than 1000 branches nationwide and is still expanding.

The [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] '''Civil Rights Division''' is the institution within the federal government responsible for enforcing federal statutes prohibiting [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[racism|race]], [[sexism|sex]], disability, [[religious intolerance|religion]], and national origin. The Division was established on December 9, 1957, by order of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[William P. Rogers]], after the [[Civil Rights Act of 1957]] created the office of [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] for Civil Rights, who has since then headed the division.  The head of the Civil Rights Division is an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights (AAG-CR) appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. The current AAG-CR is [[Eric Dreiband]].

An '''urban guerrilla'''  is someone who fights a [[government]] using [[unconventional warfare]] or [[domestic terrorism]] in an [[urban area|urban]] environment.

== Theory and history ==
The urban guerrilla phenomenon is essentially one of [[industrialisation|industrialised society]], resting both on the presence of large [[urban agglomeration]]s where hideouts are easy to find and on a theory of [[Social alienation|alienation]] proper to the modern society of [[mass consumption]].

[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], a commander of the [[Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) is often considered to be the father of modern urban guerrilla warfare.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  In April 1919 an elite assassination unit, known as [[The Squad (Irish Republican Army unit)|The Squad]] or ''Twelve Apostles'' was created in [[Dublin]].  The unit was tasked with hunting down and executing British Intelligence operatives in the city, they can be considered one of the first true urban guerrilla units.

Historically guerrilla warfare was a rural phenomenon, it was not until the 1960s that the limitations of this form were clearly demonstrated. The technique was almost entirely ineffective when used outside of the later colonial environment, as was shown by the Cuban sponsored efforts in Latin America during the 1960s culminating in the ''[[foco]]'' campaign headed by [[Che Guevara]] in Bolivia that culminated in his death. The need for the target government to be simultaneously incompetent, iniquitous, and politically isolated was rarely met.

The failure of rural insurgency forced the discontented to find new avenues for action, essentially random terrorism aimed at creating maximum publicity, provoking the targeted regimes into excessive repression and so inciting the general population to join a wider revolutionary struggle. This movement found its mentor in the leader of the ephemeral [[Ação Libertadora Nacional]], [[Carlos Marighela]]. Before his death in 1969 he wrote the ''[[Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla]]'' which, between the polemics, gave clear advice on strategy and was quickly adopted by others around the world.

However, not all urban political violence can be labeled as ''urban guerrilla''.  The [[Black Panther Party]] might not qualify, due to its public nature, although its policy of "self-defense" was interchangeable with a policy of armed struggle in militarily occupied African American communities.  Similarly the Italian [[Autonomia]] movement, and the German [[Autonomen]] engaged in urban political violence, but not as urban guerrillas due to their policies of public, mass and non-deadly violence.

In the 1970s BBC comedy "[[Citizen Smith]]" Wolfie Smith, the leader of the fictional "Tooting Popular Front" described himself as an Urban Guerrilla.

Publishing whisper networks to the public has been widely criticized for spreading unsubstantiated rumors which can damage reputations,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/post-weinstein-new-apps-aim-to-out-predators-before-they-become-serial-abusers-2018-01-24|title=These apps help victims of sexual harassment to file anonymous reports|last=Paul|first=Kari|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there continues to be debate on the best alternatives to anonymous sharing for women who have been punished or ignored by official channels yet would still like to warn other women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/01/katha-pollitt-on-second-wave-feminism-harassment-and-progress.html|title=How Second-Wave Feminism Inexplicably Became a Villain in the #MeToo Debate|last=Chotiner|first=Isaac|work=Slate Magazine|access-date=2018-01-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that certain vulnerable groups rarely get access to these private lists, for example women who are young and women of color.
