'''Abidjan''' ({{IPA-fr|abidʒɑ̃}}) is the economic capital of [[Ivory Coast]] and one of the most populous French-speaking cities in [[Africa]]. According to the 2014 census, Abidjan's population was 4.7 million, which is 20 percent of the overall population of the country, and this also makes it the fourth most populous city proper in [[Africa]], after [[Lagos]], [[Cairo]] and [[Kinshasa]]. A cultural crossroads of West Africa, Abidjan is characterised by a high level of industrialisation and urbanisation.

The city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. Abidjan remained the capital of Côte d'Ivoire after its independence from France in 1960. The completion of the [[Vridi Canal]] in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important [[sea port]]. In 1983, the city of [[Yamoussoukro]] was designated as the official political capital of Cote d'Ivoire. However, almost all political institutions and foreign [[embassy|embassies]] continue to be located in Abidjan.

Because Abidjan is also the largest city in the country and the centre of its economic activity, it has officially been designated as the "economic capital" of the country. The '''Abidjan Autonomous District''', which encompasses the city and some of its suburbs, is one of the 14 [[districts of Côte d'Ivoire]].

== Geography ==
[[File:CarteSituationAbidjan.svg|thumb|Location map of Abidjan]]
Abidjan lies on the south-east coast of the country, on the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. The city is located on the [[Ébrié Lagoon]]. The business district, [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]], is the center of the city, along with [[Cocody]], [[Deux Plateaux]] (the city's wealthiest neighborhood and a hub for diplomats), and  [[Adjamé]], a [[slum]] on the north shore of the lagoon. [[Treichville]] and [[Marcory]] lie to the south, [[Attecoube]], [[Locodjro]], [[Abobo Doume]] and [[Yopougon]] to the west, and  [[Île Boulay]] is located in the middle of the lagoon. Further south lies [[Port Bouët]], home to the [[Port Bouet Airport|airport]] and main [[seaport]]. Abidjan is located at 5°25′ North, 4°2′ West (5.41667, −4.03333).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |title=GNS: Country Files |publisher=Earth-info.nga.mil |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509082929/http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/cntry_files.html |archivedate=9 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate ===
Abidjan experiences a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] (''Aw''), according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]. Abidjan has nonconsecutive rainy seasons (precipitation above {{convert|60|mm}} with a long rainy season from March to July and a short rainy season from September to December, and three dry months (January, February and August). Precipitation is abundant during the summer months, except for August, due to activation of the [[Benguela Current]], which reduces the precipitation total throughout the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/atlantic/benguela.html| title = The Benguela Current| publisher =  Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI) and Consortium for Advanced Research on Transport of Hydrocarbons in the Environment (CARTHE) | accessdate = 8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Benguela Current also lowers the mean temperature during August, making it the coolest month of the year, averaging {{convert|24.5|C}}. Abidjan has two additional dry months (January and February). Abidjan is generally humid, with average relative humidity above 80% throughout the year.

=== Territorial divisions ===
Abidjan is composed of northern Abidjan and southern Abidjan. Each has ten formal boroughs, or communes, each being run by a mayor.&lt;!-- except we only list six each here? --&gt;

==== Communes of Northern Abidjan ====
[[File:Toursplateau1.jpg|right|thumb|Some buildings in the Plateau]]
*'''[[Abobo]]''' consists mainly of public housing. Abobo has a large population of low-income migrants. This area has developed spontaneously.
*'''[[Adjamé]]''' developed from the village of Ébrié, which existed before Abidjan developed. Although polluted and small in size, this commune is commercially very important for the Ivorian economy. It contains a varied shopping district and its bus station is the Côte d'Ivoire's main hub for international bus lines.
*'''[[Yopougon]]''' is the most populous commune of Abidjan, lying partly in Northern Abidjan and partly across the lagoon in Southern Abidjan. It is home to both industrial and residential areas. The research station [[ORSTOM]], the [[Pasteur Institute]], and a training hospital are located in this commune.
*'''[[Plateau, Côte d'Ivoire|Plateau]]''' is Ivory Coast's business center, with very modern, tall buildings. Although the governmental and administrative capital of Côte d'Ivoire officially transferred to [[Yamoussoukro]] in 1983, the institutions of the republic such as the Presidency and National Assembly are still located in Plateau. It is the main administrative, commercial and financial center of Ivory Coast.
*'''[[Attécoubé]]''' contains [[Banco National Park|Banco]] forest, classified as a national park.
*'''[[Cocody]]''' is famous for its residential districts, Deux-Plateaux and Riviera. The [[University of Cocody]], a public institution, and some private universities are also located within the commune. [[Radio Television Ivoirienne (RTI)]] is located in Cocody. The President of the Republic also resides in this commune, which contains the embassy district.

==== Communes of Southern Abidjan ====
[[File:Abidjanvridi.jpg|Beach of Vridi|thumb|upright]]

*'''[[Koumassi]]''': This commune has an important industrial area.
*'''[[Marcory]]''': This commune is mainly residential, and contains the upscale {{Interlanguage link multi|Biétry|fr}} and [[:fr:Zone 4|Zone 4]] neighborhoods where many foreigners live.
*'''[[Port-Bouët]]''': This commune includes the ([[:fr:Société Ivoirienne de Raffinage|SIR]] refinery and the Félix Houphouët-Boigny International [[Port Bouet Airport|airport]]. There is also an established office of the [[Institut de Recherche pour le Développement|IRD]], the centre of Little Bassam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ird.ci/ird/petitbassam.html |title=Centre des Sciences Sociales |website=[[Institut de recherche pour le développement|IRD]] |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207201015/http://www.ird.ci/ird/petitbassam.html |archivedate=7 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[lighthouse]] sweeps the [[Gulf of Guinea]] for several nautical miles out. The [[Vridi]] beach area is busy every weekend although the ocean is very rough; this phenomenon widely holds all along the [[Gulf of Guinea]]. From 1950 on, Vridi has been the primary employment hub in Abidjan because of its increasing number of factories and warehouses.
*'''[[Treichville]]''': This commune is home to the [[Autonomous Port of Abidjan]] and to many stores. The port area is also industrial. There is also the Treichville state swimming pool (PET),&lt;!-- "piscine d'état de" ? --&gt; the Treichville sports palace, the [[Palace of Culture of Abidjan|Palace of Culture]], and the Abidjan [[racetrack]].
** [[Île Boulay]].

==== Suburbs ====
Towns near Abidjan include [[Jacqueville]], [[Grand-Lahou]] and [[Dabou]] in the west; [[Sikensi]], [[Tiassalé]], [[Agboville]], [[Adzopé]] and [[Alépé]] in the north; and [[Grand-Bassam]] to the east.

The towns (or [[sub-prefectures of Ivory Coast|sub-prefectures]]) of [[Anyama]], [[Bingerville]], [[Brofodoumé]] and [[Songon]] are within the [[Abidjan Department]], which is co-extensive with the autonomous district.

== &lt;span id=Toponymy&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Etymology ==
According to [[oral tradition]] of the [[Tchaman]] as reported in the Encyclopedic Dictionary of Côte d'Ivoire,&lt;ref&gt;de R. Borremans (1986)&lt;/ref&gt; the name "Abidjan" results from a misunderstanding. Legend states that an old man carrying branches to repair the roof of his house met a European explorer who asked him the name of the nearest village. The old man did not speak the language of the explorer, and thought that he was being asked to justify his presence in that place. Terrified by this unexpected meeting, he fled shouting "''min-chan m'bidjan''", which means in the Ébrié language: "I just cut the leaves." The explorer, thinking that his question had been answered, recorded the name of the locale as ''Abidjan''.

A slightly different and less elaborate version of the legend: When the first colonists asked a native man the name of the place, the man misunderstood and replied "''M'bi min djan''": "I've just been cutting leaves".&lt;ref name="statoids1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/uci.html |title=Côte d'Ivoire Regions |publisher=Statoids.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Abidjan}}

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:Piroguiers - cleaned b&amp;w.jpg|thumb|Abidjan boatmen.]]

Abidjan was originally a small [[Tchaman|Atchan]] fishing village. In 1896, following a series of deadly [[yellow fever]] [[epidemics]], French [[colonist]]s who had initially settled in [[Grand-Bassam]] decided to move to a safer place and in 1898 chose the current location of Abidjan. In 1903 it officially became a town.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Abidjan|edition = 15th |year=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers were followed by the colonial government, created in 1899. But then nearby [[Bingerville]] became the capital of the French [[colony]], from 1900 until 1934.

The future Abidjan, situated on the edge of the ''lagoon n'doupé'' ("the lagoon in hot water"), offered more land and greater opportunities for trade expansion. The wharf in Petit Bassam (now [[Port-Bouet]]) south of town quickly overtook the wharf of [[Grand-Bassam]] in importance, and became the main point of economic access to the colony. In 1904, the rail terminus was located in the [[Port-Bouet]] area of Abidjan.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Starting in 1904, when [[Bingerville]] was not yet complete, Abidjan became the main economic hub of the colony of Ivory Coast and a prime channel for distributing products to the European [[hinterland]], particularly through the Lebanese community, which was increasing in importance.

{{Interlanguage link multi|Henri de Fougères|fr|3=Henri Terrasson de Fougères}} became governor of [[French Sudan]] in 1924, and remained governor until his death in 1931. One of the main streets of Abidjan still bears his name.

In 1931, Plateau and what would become [[Treichville]] were connected by a floating bridge, more or less where the [[Houphouët-Boigny Bridge]] stands today. The year 1931 also saw [[Address (geography)|addresses]] begin to be assigned to the streets of Abidjan for the first time. The addressing project was temporarily concluded in 1964, under the leadership of Mayor Konan Kanga, then badly redone American-style in 1993.

Abidjan became the third capital of Ivory Coast by a 1934 decree, following [[Grand-Bassam]] and [[Bingerville]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Several villages in Tchaman were then deserted. The leader of the Tchaman community can still be found in Adjame ("center" or "meeting" in Tchaman), north of the Plateau.

South of the Plateau district (the current central district of the city of Abidjan), the village of ''Dugbeo'' was moved across the lagoon to Anoumabo, "the forest of fruit bats", which became the neighborhood of [[Treichville]] (now known as Commikro, city of clerks). Treichville was renamed in 1934, in honour of [[Marcel Treich-Laplénie]] (1860–1890), the first explorer of the Ivory Coast and its first colonial administrator, considered its founder. Instead of Dugbeyo, is the current Treich-Laplénie Avenue, the bus station and water lagoon buses in Plateau, and the Avenue [[Charles de Gaulle]] (commonly called Rue du Commerce).

The city was laid out like most colonial towns, on a [[grid plan]]. [[Plateau, Côte d'Ivoire|Le Plateau]] ("m'brato" in Tchaman) were inhabited by settlers. In the north, the city was inhabited by the colonized. The two zones were separated by the [[Gallieni]] Military Barracks, where now there is the current courthouse.

Near the port, originally named Boulevard de Marseille, settlers became defensive and stole a street sign of a famous street of Marseille renamed the street Canebière, a sand track. This is the legend behind the first Blohorn oil mills, in [[Cocody]] and a racetrack was built in the south of the city.

In Le Plateau in the 1940s, the Bardon Park Hotel was built, the first air-conditioned hotel working in [[francophone Africa]].

Abidjan's lagoon became connected to the sea once the 15m-deep {{Interlanguage link multi|Vridi|fr}} canal was completed in 1950.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; Soon Abidjan became the financial center of West Africa. In 1958, the first bridge to connect [[Petit Bassam|Petit-Bassam Island]] with the mainland was completed.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

=== After independence ===
When Côte d’Ivoire became independent in 1960, Abidjan became the new country’s administrative and economic center. The axis south of Treichville, towards the international airport and the beaches, became the heart of European and middle-class Abidjan. The city saw considerable population growth in the decades following independence, expanding from 180,000 inhabitants in 1960 to 1,269,000 in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/abidjan-cote-divoire-1903|title=Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (1903-    ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abidjan’s skyline dates back to the economic prosperity of this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/CIV_Port_of_Abidjan_1422.php|title=Port of Abidjan|website=World Port Source|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New districts such as the upmarket Cocody were founded during in this period; built to a large extent in a colonial style, Cocody has since become home to Côte d’Ivoire’s wealthy classes as well as expatriates and foreign diplomats. The district is home to the embassy of France, Hotel Ivoire (which for a long time, was the only African hotel to have a skating rink), and, since 2009, the largest U.S. embassy in West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/a-13-2005-07-12-voa68-66931712/264223.html|title=Massive New US Embassy Opens in Ivory Coast|newspaper=VOA|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on St. Paul’s Cathedral, designed by Italian architect Aldo Spirito, began with the 1980 groundbreaking by Pope John Paul II and was completed in 1985. From the 1980s, Abidjan’s fortunes declined as a result of negligence on the part of officials as well as corruption and general degradation. In 1983, the village of Yamoussoukro became the new political capital of Ivory Coast under the leadership of President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, who was born in Yamoussoukro.

From 2002 to 2007 and especially from 2010 to 2011, Abidjan suffered from the consequences of the First and Second Ivorian Civil Wars. In November 2004, armed conflict broke out between French forces and Ivorian forces loyal to Laurent Gbagbo after the Ivorian Air Force attacked French peacekeepers in northern Côte d’Ivoire. After France destroyed Côte d’Ivoire’s air capabilities in retaliation, pro-Gbagbo groups staged riots and looting in Abidjan and targeted French homes, schools, and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/ivory-coast-2004.htm|title=Ivory Coast Conflict - 2004|last=Pike|first=John|website=www.globalsecurity.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; French peacekeepers moved into the city to calm the situation. Other crises during the first civil war period include the case of the Probo Koala in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://probo-koala.com/probo-koala-the-cargo-and-journey-of-the-trafigura-chartered-supertanker/?lang=en|title=Probo Koala: the cargo and journey of the Trafigura-chartered supertanker - LE SCANDALE DU PROBO KOALA|date=2016-08-08|newspaper=LE SCANDALE DU PROBO KOALA|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-01|df=dmy-all}}{{dead link|date=August 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which disposed products caused thousands of residents to seek medical attention. Côte d’Ivoire’s civil conflicts seriously impacted the security situation in Abidjan. Amidst the anti-French riots in November 2004, 4,000 prisoners in Abidjan escaped from the country’s largest prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/world/africa/ivory-coast-says-4000-prison-inmates-escaped.html|title=Ivory Coast Says 4,000 Prison Inmates Escaped|last=The Associated Press|date=2004-11-12|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abidjan was one of the main theaters of the 2010-2011 Ivorian crisis and the site of major demonstrations against incumbent president Gbagbo, including one on International Women’s Day in 2011 that saw several demonstrators killed by Gbagbo’s forces. The end of the crisis came with Gbagbo’s capture in Abidjan in April 2011, following a major offensive by forces loyal to election winner Alassane Ouattara with support from France and the UN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ivory-coast-strongman-laurent-gbagbo-arrested/|title=Ivory Coast strongman Laurent Gbagbo arrested|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
=== Administration ===

==== Organisation ====
Formerly managed by the French colonial administration, Abidjan became a municipality in 1956, divided into administrative areas by lagoons. Its first municipal council was elected on 18 November 1956, and the first mayor in the context of the Loi-Cadre of 1956&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Loi n°56-619 du 23 juin 1956: MESURES PROPRES A ASSURER L'EVOLUTION DES TERRITOIRES RELEVANT DU MINISTERE DE LA FRANCE D'OUTRE-MER |url=https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000692222}}&lt;/ref&gt; was president [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. A 1978 law created twenty-seven municipalities in the country. After the application of this new organization, Dioulo Emmanuel was elected mayor of Abidjan on 30 November 1980.

Since 2001, the city has been divided into ten boroughs (communes). In 2011, the autonomous district of Abidjan was established by a decree instituting a system based on districts and regions instead.&lt;ref&gt;Décret n° 2011-263 du 28 septembre 2011 portant organisation du territoire national en Districts et en Régions.&lt;/ref&gt; with rural sub-prefectures in [[Anyama]], [[Bingerville]], [[Brofodoumé]], and [[Songon]]. The autonomous district overlaps the [[Abidjan Department]], which was established in 1969 and has had its current boundaries since 1998. In 2011, the post of Mayor of Abidjan was replaced by that of District Governor, appointed by the head of state. The position has been occupied by [[Robert Beugré Mambé]] since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abidjan.district.ci/index2.php?page=gou |title=Anciens Maires et Gouverneurs |trans-title=Former Mayors and Governors |publisher=Abidjan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the ten communes of Abidjan has its own municipal council, headed by a mayor. The last municipal elections were held in March 2001. The sub-prefectures of the autonomous district also have their own mayors and councils.

The communes of Abobo, Adjamé, Attécoubé, Cocody, and Plateau are located north of the Ébrié Lagoon (hence the name "Abidjan North"). This is the continental part of Abidjan.
The commune of Yopougon straddles the lagoon, with part lying north and part south of that body of water. The communes of [[Treichville]], [[Koumassi]], [[Marcory]], and [[Port-Bouet]] in Abidjan are south of the lagoon. [[Blokosso]] and [[Locodjro]] villages are included within the city and maintain cultural identity in urban areas.

== Places of interest ==
[[File:AbidjanSib.JPG|thumb|right|Le Plateau, Abidjan]]

The [[University of Abidjan]] (1958),&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; technical colleges, and the [[National Library of Côte d'Ivoire]] and [[National museum]] are in Abidjan.

Sights in Abidjan include [[Cathédrale Saint-Paul d'Abidjan|St Paul's Cathedral]] designed by Aldo Spirito, the Cocody Municipal Museum of Contemporary Art and the [[Parc du Banco]] [[rainforest]] reserve.

Plateau is known for its skyscrapers, which are unusual in West Africa. It is the business centre of Abidjan. With its gleaming skyscrapers, high-end shops, and outdoor cafes, Plateau is a favourite place of business travelers. There are also many different banks located in the Plateau district.

=== Government institutions ===
[[File:Asnat codivoire.jpg|thumb|Seat of the [[National Assembly of Cote d'Ivoire]]]]

The majority of Ivorian government institutions are still located in Abidjan and have not been transferred to the political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]]. The President's office is in [[Cocody]],&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.présidence.ci Le site officiel de la présidence de Côte d'Ivoire]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.premierministre.ci Site officiel de la Primature de la République ivoirienne]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Constitutional Council (Côte d'Ivoire)|Constitutional Council]], the Supreme Court, and the Chancellery of the National Order are all in [[Plateau, Côte d'Ivoire|Plateau]]. Under the presidency of [[Laurent Gbagbo]] (2000–11), efforts were made to give effect to the project of making the political capital Yamoussoukro in Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courrierinternational.com/article.asp?obj_id=13683 |title=Article de Courrier International |work=Courrier International |location=France |date=24 March 2011 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goal continues to be the consensus of the country's political leaders.

Government offices are located in [[Le Plateau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.gouv.ci Portail officiel du gouvernement ivoirien]&lt;/ref&gt; in the administrative district of Abidjan, Boulevard Carde or Angoulvant Boulevard (near the Cathedral of St. Paul of Abidjan), or elsewhere in the great buildings of the town.

=== Security ===
The instability of the 2002-2007 civil war and 2010-2011 crisis saw foreign peacekeeping forces stationed in Abidjan. The United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire ([[United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire|UNOCI]]), established in April 2004, has its headquarters at the former Hotel Sebroko in Attécoubé. While the size of the force has been reduced since the end of the 2011 crisis, UNOCI’s mandate was extended in 2013 and again in 2015. The force remains authorized to maintain up to 5,245 troops, 192 observers, 1,500 police and eight customs officers in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/missions/unoci/background.shtml|title=UNOCI Background - United Nations Operation in Côte d'Ivoire|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France’s peacekeeping operations in Côte d’Ivoire continued under the aegis of Operation Unicorn until 2015 and then as the French forces in Côte d’Ivoire from 2015 onward. In 2014, French defense minister Jean-Yves Le Drian announced that Abidjan would be reinforced as the entry point for France’s military presence and counterterrorism operations in the Sahel region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/world/france-to-create-new-africa-outposts-to-better-fight-terrorism-1.1649084|title=France to create new Africa outposts to better fight terrorism|last=Keaten|first=Jamey|newspaper=CTVNews|language=en-CA|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; After al-Qaeda militants targeted beachgoers at Grand Bassam in March 2016, the French government announced it would increase its troop deployment in Côte d’Ivoire from 500 to 900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mgafrica.com/article/2016-04-30-france-says-it-will-increase-forces-in-ivory-coast-as-region-faces-growing-islamist-threat|title=France says it will increase forces in Côte d'Ivoire, as region faces growing Islamist threat|date=2016-04-30|newspaper=MG Africa|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; French soldiers are based in Port-Bouet as well as at the Abidjan airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defense.gouv.fr/ema/forces-prepositionnees/cote-d-ivoire/dossier/les-forces-francaises-en-cote-d-ivoire|title=Les forces françaises en Côte d'Ivoire|website=www.defense.gouv.fr|access-date=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Pierre Laba’s comedy film ''Permanent Danger'' explored the laxity of the police against banditry in major African cities, specifically in Abidjan.

==== Police ====
Abidjan is divided into districts, each of which has a police station. The municipal police and national police are separate.

All police are trained at the National Police Academy in the town of Cocody. They are recruited by competitive examination held by the police administration. The police include several sections, such as the BAE (Anti Riot Squad), whose base is located in Yopougon north of the city, the CRS (Republican Security Company), whose main base is located in Williamsville (Adjame) and also includes a secondary base called CRS2, which is located in zone 4 in the town of [[Marcory]] in the central capital. The Force{{who|date=October 2016}} and CECOS accompany the police.

The main base of the gendarmerie is at Agban (commonly Adjamé). There are others in [[Abobo]] and [[Kumasi]], It also has a training school in Cocody and the city{{clarify|date=October 2016}}.

==== Drugs ====
Since 2000, Côte d'Ivoire has experienced a sharp rise in drug trafficking. Drug dens arise mainly in informal settlements and there has been a recent spike in demand among unemployed youth and Ivorian vagrants. The Ivorian police increasingly focus on the fight against trafficking and drug use in the district of Abidjan. A report by the Office of the UN says West Africa plays an increasingly important role in the transit of cocaine to Latin American and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

=== French military base ===
Abidjan is home to [[Port-Bouet]], one of the six French military bases that still exist in Africa ([[Dakar]], [[Libreville]], [[Bouar]] CAR, [[N'Djamena]] and [[Djibouti]]). Thousands of people live there, around the 43rd BIMA which is permanently in place in accordance with established defense agreements on 24 April 1961 linking the two countries.&lt;ref&gt;

== Society ==
The 1998 census recorded Abidjan's population as 2,877,923. Estimates for the population of the Abidjan metropolitan area {{As of|2005|lc=on}} vary between 4 and 5 million inhabitants. As Abidjan is inhabited by people from a wide array of different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]], French is commonly spoken in the [[metropolitan area]], which is the fourth largest French speaking metropolitan area in the world after [[Paris]], [[Montreal]] and [[Kinshasa]].{{Citation needed|reason=Reference needed. An authoritative reference is needed so that the relative sizes of these Francophone cities is acknowledged in the different articles|date=June 2009}} Colloquial Abidjan French has even appeared, which has a different pronunciation and some familiar words from standard French.

=== Demographics ===
The population of Abidjan was 4,707,404 at the 2014 census. In 2006, the metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase can be attributed to the displacement since September 2002 caused by the war. Many inhabitants come to live in town for employment and safer housing.

[[File:Abidjan Centre1.JPG|thumb|right|Abidjan Centre]]
By 1950, Abidjan had just exceeded a population of 50,000 (at the end of 1948). Reaching a population of a million by the end of 1975, the city grew at a rate of 10 to 12% per year, doubling every six or seven years. However, this growth underwent a sharp decline due to the crises of the 1980s and 1990s. In the last 20 years of the 20th century, the growth rate dropped to 3–6%. Birth rate growth was supplemented by migration, with the influx being substantial and the outflow only partly compensating the arrivals. The migration, prior to the census of 1988, contributed a growth of about 80,000 with 50,000 people from within Côte d'Ivoire, and about 30,000 from abroad per Côte d'Ivoireyear. From within Côte d'Ivoire, the migration pattern was dominated by [[Akan people|Akan]] (South-east, 48%), then [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] (North-west, 24%) and [[Krumen people|Krou]] (South-west, 20%). From abroad, the migration was [[Burkina Faso|Burkinabes]] (30%), [[Mali]]ans (22%), [[Ghana]]ians (19%), [[Niger]]ien (11%), and [[Guinea]]ns (9%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cicred.org/Eng/Seminars/Details/Seminars/education/ACTES/Com_Zanou.PDF |title=Strategies Educatives En Milieu Emigre De La Cote-D'Ivoire |accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the non-African migration, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] migration was highest, followed by European migration, with the French being largest of this latter group. All in all, people of non-African origin represent 3% of the total population of Abidjan, which remains the highest in the region.

The figures for 2006 estimated the population of Abidjan to 3,796,677 inhabitants, while the larger metropolitan area of Abidjan had 5,060,858 inhabitants. This population increase is mainly due to war events of September 2002. The town hosts many people in search of both jobs and secure homes.

Before 2014, the last population census in the country had taken place in 1998. It presented 2,877,948 inhabitants for the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056 |title=La Ville d'Abidjan: Population |website=Digital Afrique |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928162745/http://www.digital-afrique.com/villafrique1/abidjan/city/index.asp?id=056 |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new census was held in May 2014 and showed a population for the city of 4,707,404.

=== Languages ===
The traditional language of the city was [[Ebrié language|Ebrié]]. Since independence, the [[official language]] in Abidjan and throughout Côte d'Ivoire has been French. While the official language is a formal variety standard French similar to that of Paris, the most commonly spoken form of [[African French#Abidjan French vocabulary|French in Abidjan]] is a colloquial dialect known as ''français de Treichville'' or ''français de Moussa'' which differs from standard French in pronunciation and in some of its vocabulary. Another form of spoken French in Abidjan is ''[[Nouchi]]'', a highly informal variety used as adolescent slang. The historical lingua franca, still spoken and understood by most of the trading population of Abidjan, is [[Dioula language|Dioula]]. The city hosts many Ivorians from all over the country and about sixty vernacular languages are spoken, such as [[Attié language|Attié]], [[Baoulé language|Baoulé]], [[Bété language|Bété]], and [[Wobé language|Wobé]]. Abidjan is surrounded by more than thirty villages where Baoulé and Ébrié are still commonly spoken.

=== Education ===
In Côte d'Ivoire, the enrollment rate is 74%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/livre244/l24424.pdf |title=La Scolarisation en Côte d'Ivoire |first=Noël Kouassi |last=Ayewa |language=French |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625164113/http://www.bibliotheque.refer.org/livre244/l24424.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and access to secondary education is limited by an entrance assessment at the 6th stage after which one-third of students are allowed to continue their studies. 24% of the student population resides in Abidjan, which comprises 20% of the total population. Abidjan is the location of the main educational institutions in the Côte d'Ivoire. These include the Lycée Classique d'Abidjan, the Lycée Sainte-Marie de Cocody, Lycée garçon de Bingerville, Mami Adjoua the Lyceum, the Blaise Pascal Abidjan school is a French school – a school who has signed an agreement with the ADFE. Recently the Lycée International Jean-Mermoz re-opened which was initially called College International Jean-Mermoz, founded by Pierre Padovani. The Institution suffered from a devastating war and was forced to close.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adfe.org |title=Site de l'ADFE |publisher=Adfe.org |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Health ===
Some traditional medicine establishments sell traditional drugs in the street.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} There are numerous health centers, pharmacies and pharmacopoeias.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The city has more than fifty clinics, and over sixty specialist locations ([[veterinary]], [[dermatology]], [[Dentistry|dental]], [[optometry]], motherhood, [[psychology]], [[pediatrics]], etc.){{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}.

=== Urbanism and habitat ===
Modern districts like [[Le Plateau, Abidjan|Plateau]] or [[Cocody]] have developed similar to those in Europe with the construction of large office towers and apartment buildings between the 1970s and the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/fr/wm/ci/bu/sk/li/?id=100024&amp;bt=5&amp;ht=2&amp;sro=0 |title=Abidjan – Immeubles de grandes hauteurs existant |publisher=Emporis |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional neighborhoods like [[Treichville]] or [[Marcory]] maintained the system of "concessions" where housing is adjacent to the plant and an area of several houses, within the normal organization and multi centuries-old African villages.&lt;ref&gt;Haeringer Ph., Vingt-cinq ans de politique urbaine à Abidjan ou la tentation de l'urbanisme intégral, Politique Africaine, n°17, 20–40, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The district of [[Cocody]] is also home to many single-storey wooden villas, surrounded by vast gardens of lush vegetation, fed by the heavy rains that water the city. Wealthier inhabitants constructed villas in imitation of Greek temples in this district. In addition, many houses were built on stilts on the edge of the [[Ébrié Lagoon]]. The town hall, a fine example of [[modernist]] architecture, was designed by architect {{Interlanguage link multi|Henri Chomette(architect)|fr|3=Henri Chomette (architecte)|lt=Henri Chomette}}.

==== Problems with urban network ====
[[File:Abidjan-Plateau1.JPG|thumb|Urban Network in Le Plateau]]

The urban network is disrupted, as Abidjan has seen its population double every seven years since 1945. Rural people are attracted by the opportunities of the city. Abidjan represents 45% of city dwellers in the Côte d'Ivoire and 20% of the overall population. The city is by far the country's largest, dwarfing the second-largest city, [[Bouaké]] (which had 542,082 inhabitants in 2014) as well as the political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]] (207,412 inhabitants).

==== Urban squalor ====

Since the [[2006 Ivory Coast toxic waste dump|2006 Probo Koala toxic waste spill]],&lt;ref&gt;Probo-Koala : la mortelle errance d'un bateau-poubelle, ''Le Monde'', 29 septembre 2006&lt;/ref&gt; significant efforts have been made to address waste management issues in Abidjan. In 2006, a contract was signed between [[China]] and Côte d'Ivoire: a Chinese company handling urban waste and industrial plans to treat all waste district this transformation also create daily cleaning. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abidjan.net/videos/video_wm.asp?n=4467&amp;cat=pol |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927210206/http://news.abidjan.net/videos/video_wm.asp?n=4467&amp;cat=pol |title=Salubrité urbaine : Signature d’un accord entre la chine et le District d’Abidjan |website=Abidjan.net |language=French |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French nongovernmental organisation ACTED rolled out a three-part project across three districts of Abidjan in 2016, establishing street cleaning, waste collection and hygiene training. ACTED spokesperson Jérémy Lescot described the project as "a fine success".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ready-for-the-resource-revolution.com/en/acted-sustainable-access-to-sanitation-in-ivory-coast/ |title="ACTED: sustainable access to sanitation in Ivory Coast" |website=Ready for the Rescue |accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Urban rehabilitation ====
The last transportation upgrade in Abidjan led to the repaving of certain roads in the capital in 1994. Since May 2007, the company {{Interlanguage link multi|Ageroute|fr}} (Road Management Agency) is undertaking major operations in Abidjan and [[Anyama]] relating to badly damaged roads, suffering from lack of maintenance, heavy rain and protests. It is also addressing the gutters and unpaved roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaf.org/fr/pays/fiche.php?itm=2124&amp;md=&amp;thm=&amp;p=16 |title=Article du Matin d'Abidjan

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The District and BNETD plan to rehabilitate and construct {{convert|400|to(-)|500|mi|km|abbr=off}}, providing them with a quality to last 15–20 years of life. Improvements include the rehabilitation of roads in Abidjan and [[Anyama]], construction of drains, the tarring of gravel roads and sanitation of the city by the construction of sewers. These rehabilitations affect all municipalities in Abidjan:

* In [[Cocody]], at a cost of 3&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs, reconstruction of the [[Corniche]], one of the busiest roads in the municipality. Reconstruction has been extended by the dam of the limit, located at the ''Carrefour de la vie'', to filter all waste dumped into the lagoon.
* At [[Yopougon]], the rehabilitation nerve Sand continues with the construction of a culvert {{convert|200|ft|m|abbr=off}} long designed to slow the streaking wastewater, the main cause of the degradation of pathways.
* In [[Abobo]] the degradation of the roads requires a significant investment in manufacturing and installation of gutters to ensure proper sanitation. The rehabilitation of roads and highways continues.

== Industry ==
The region near the lagoons is the most industrialized region of the country.

Major industries include [[food processing]], [[lumber]], automobile manufacturing, textiles, [[chemical industry|chemicals]], and [[soap]]. There is also a large [[oil refinery]]. Its industries are mainly in construction and maintenance with the presence of major international groups: the furnace SETAO, Colas, [[Bouygues]], [[Jean Lefebvre]], and Swiss [[Holcim]].

There are textile industries with the packaging of cotton in the north both for export or for on-site processing of cloth, canvas, batik clothing and miscellaneous. The textile sector is very dynamic, and represents 15.6% of net investment, 13% of turnover and 24% of the value added in Ivorian industry.

There are several offshore oil wells in operation (Côte d'Ivoire is an oil producing country), which leads to the presence of a chemical industry with oil refineries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mbendi.co.za/french/RESI.HTM |title=Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR) – Simple Oil Refinery in Vridi, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire |publisher=Mbendi.co.za |date= |accessdate=9 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620001603/http://www.mbendi.co.za/french/RESI.HTM |archive-date=20 June 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an oil port. It also works on stones and precious metals for exportation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notre-planete.info/actualites/actu_1209_moratoire_interdiction_commerce_ivoire.php |title=Interdiction du commerce international de l'ivoire |publisher=Notre-planete.info |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city also has a large wood processing plant at the port by river from the forests of central [[Canada]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}. It exports natural [[mahogany]], peeled wood, [[plywood]] and [[Paperboard|chipboard]] for the past two centuries.

Food industry mainly include: the production of [[palm oil]], [[bergamot orange|bergamot]] and [[Seville oranges]]. In the west, rubber is processed as well as manufacturing beverages from [[pineapples]], oranges&lt;ref&gt;En Afrique de l'Ouest, les oranges ont la peau verte&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mango]]es, producing robust [[coffee]]: Côte d'Ivoire is the third largest producer, behind [[Colombia]] and [[Brazil]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tkwa.free.fr/lespaysproducteurs.php |title=Carte des pays producteurs de café |publisher=Tkwa.free.fr |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and processing [[cocoa bean|cocoa]],it is the third largest producer in the world behind [[Ghana]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/francais/cacao/marche.htm |title=Le marché du cacao |publisher=Unctad.org |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403105821/http://www.unctad.org/infocomm/francais/cacao/marche.htm |archive-date=3 April 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (37% of cocoa and 10% of coffee products undergo at least one first local processing). Abidjan is also the first African [[tuna]] port for the European market. This generated 3,000 salaried jobs and is an important source of foreign exchange. As in all countries of the Third World developing countries, much of the city's economy lies in what economists describe as informal economy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN02103lcononajdib0 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927195014/http://www.jeuneafrique.com/jeune_afrique/article_jeune_afrique.asp?art_cle=LIN02103lcononajdib0 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |title=L'économie parallèle, béquille d'Abidjan. |language=French |date=2001-10-02 |first=Paul |last=Loubière}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its many "odd jobs".&lt;ref&gt;Abdou Touré, La civilisation quotidienne en Côte d'Ivoire: Les petits métiers à Abidjan, Éditions Karthala, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tertiary sector ===
The development of tertiary industry, with the establishment of international commercial banks and the increasing number of service companies of all types, appears to be the trend of recent years. Abidjan is the main financial center of [[French West Africa]]. The seat of the common stock exchange of West Africa (BRVM) is located in Abidjan. BRVM is mainly dominated by Ivorian firms.

=== Electricity ===
The thermal power plant Azito, built in 1997 in partnership with [[Électricité de France|EDF]], located on the Yopougon on the edge of the lagoon and facing Ébrié Island Boulay, alone provides 300 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azitoenergie.com/index2.htm |title=La centrale thermique d'Azito |publisher=Azitoenergie.com |accessdate=28 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310120018/http://www.azitoenergie.com/index2.htm |archive-date=10 March 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other power plants, built in 1984 and 1985, are installed in [[Vridi]].

[[Port Bouet Airport|Felix Houphouet Boigny International Airport]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aeria.ci/abideng.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040705171600/http://www.aeria.ci/abideng.htm |archivedate=2004-07-05 |title=Abidjan Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves the city. Work on a new [[Abidjan Metro|metro system]] has begun, with the beginning of service anticipated in 2020.

[[Société des transports Abidjanais|SOTRA]] (Abidjan Transport Company) ensure urban transportation in Abidjan via bus, taxi and luggage Line Express.

Sotra has announced the start of work for the use of light rail to Abidjan. The project has three phases at a cost of 125&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs for a long loop of 32&amp;nbsp;km.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==== Taxis ====
There are two kinds: the taxi-meter (Red), which can travel throughout the city, and woro-woro (yellow and green, blue or orange depending on the commune), which are limited to a neighborhood.

==== Airport ====
[[Port Bouet Airport]] has a large capacity that allows it to accommodate all existing large aircraft. Abidjan is located an hour's flight from all the capitals of the sub-region. Abidjan is served by major airlines in the direction of the great capitals of the world. Headquarters of the former multinational African Air company, Abidjan has nearly 900,000 passengers (1995 figure)

==== Circulation ====
The District&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abidjan-da.ci/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219065904/http://www.abidjan-da.ci/index.html |archivedate=2007-02-19 |title=BIENVENUE}}&lt;/ref&gt; has several paved streets and boulevards linking the towns between them and the District across the country. Abidjan has a network of urban bypasses.

River transport is already consistent with fishing spots and many "boat-buses" connecting the various neighborhoods of the city thrives plan lagoon.

Abidjan is also the bridgehead of the country's only highway linking the city to the administrative and political capital, [[Yamoussoukro]].

==== Port ====
[[File:2009 Abidjan port 3841939455.jpeg|thumb|right|Port of Abidjan, 2009]]
Abidjan has one of the biggest ports in the sub-region (West Africa). It is a container transshipment port and was opened in 1951 in the presence of the Minister of Overseas and Colonies at the time, [[François Mitterrand]]. The 15m deep [[Vridi Canal]], where boats with large draughts can dock in the deep-water port.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winne.com/ssa/ivorycoast/reports/2007/cp/port_autonome/index.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927233942/http://www.winne.com/ssa/ivorycoast/reports/2007/cp/port_autonome/index.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 September 2007 |title=Le port d'Abidjan |publisher=Winne.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Côte d'Ivoire is in the Franc Zone (where the currency is CFA francs), as part of the [[West African Economic and Monetary Union]] (WAEMU). Abidjan is the economic centre of both the Côte d'Ivoire and of the whole region, including [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Mali]]; this is mainly because of its deep-water port. The road network in Abidjan (5,600&amp;nbsp;km asphalted in 1995, compared to 1,000&amp;nbsp;km in 1970), which covers the whole region, effectively increases its port activity as 50% of the business from [[Burkina Faso]], [[Mali]] and [[Niger]] pass through it.

Abidjan receives the bulk of the country's industrial activity; its port alone receiving 60% of ivory park industry. Abidjan has ambitions of oil-production—off-shore production and especially [[refining]] and distribution. In 1995 the port received 12 million traffic, of which 5.5&amp;nbsp;million tonnes were petroleum products.

Exports include coffee, [[cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[timber]], [[bananas]], [[pineapple]]s, and [[manganese]].&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

==== Bridges ====
The two-halves of the city, Northern Abidjan and Southern Abidjan, are joined by the Houphouët-Boigny, the Charles de Gaulle and the [[Henri Konan Bédié Bridge|Henri Konan Bédié]] bridges. The two former bridges, built in the 1950s and 1960s respectively, are located between [[Treichville]] and [[Plateau, Ivory Coast|Le Plateau]]. The [[Second Abidjan Bridge|Général-de-Gaulle Bridge]] extends over the immense Valéry Giscard d'Estaing Boulevard which leads to the airport. Both bridges are often congested, especially during rush hour or on the occasion of police and military roadblocks.

A third {{cvt|1.5|km|mi}} toll bridge and expressway, the [[Henri Konan Bédié Bridge]] between [[Cocody]] and [[Marcory]] was completed in December 2014. Project construction began in the second half of 2012 and required the relocation of several homes and businesses opposite the Mille Maquis (the noted restaurant ''la Bâche bleue'' was moved).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Cadasse |url=http://www.afrik.com/article5740.html |title=La Bache bleue |publisher=Afrik.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data reported by the [[African Development Bank]], 2,499 persons were impacted by the bridge construction and were relocated and compensated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Henri Konan Bédié Bridge, a masterpiece in the heart of Abidjan|url=http://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/article/the-henri-konan-bedie-bridge-a-masterpiece-in-the-heart-of-abidjan-13858/|website=www.afdb.org|publisher=African Development Bank Group|accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Trains and trams ====
{{Main article|Rail transport in Côte d'Ivoire}}
[[File:2014 Abidjan train 14462380563.jpg|thumb|left|Train platform, Abidjan, 2014]]
The city is the foothold for the region's only railway:  the Abidjan-[[Ouagadougou]] line, with stations in [[Treichville]], [[Abobo]] and [[Adjamé]]. This line only has two trains, the ''Gazelle'' and the ''Bélier'', and links the two capitals in about 40 hours.&lt;ref&gt;La construction de cette ligne a commencé en 1902. Elle devait à l'origine relier Abidjan à [[Niamey]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent project in Abidjan is one for an electric train which is promised by the Ivory Society of Railroads (SICF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lematindabidjan.com/visual_article.php?num_actualite=648 |title=Article Le matin d'Abidjan |publisher=Lematindabidjan.com |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of infrastructural projects has been envisaged, including a suburban train system in Abidjan which is estimated to cost almost 100&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs. This suburban train system would link the North-West to the East and North of the city. The project extends over 25&amp;nbsp;km of railway tracks which {{As of|2011|lc=on}} were used by the operator [[Sitarail]], a subsidiary company of the [[Bolloré]] group. The infrastructural works (tracks, electrification, and civil engineers) have been estimated at 40&amp;nbsp;billion [[CFA francs]], financed by the State of Ivory Coast and backers ([[World Bank]] and the French Development Agency). In addition, a BOT concession contract would be given to a private operator, over 20–30 years, to operate the network. This operator will be in charge of the acquisition of railway materials, workshop renovation and the implementation of an organisational system. The concession contract has been estimated at around 60&amp;nbsp;billion CFA francs.

=== Tourism ===

Abidjan is a unique city in Africa. Its nicknames, such as "Manhattan of the tropics", "Small Manhattan" or "Pearl of the lagoons", explain the city's unpredictable and triumphant image. With its accommodation facilities – such as the Golf Hôtel&amp;nbsp;– and sporting facilities, its lively night life, transport and communication lines as well as its impressiveness, it is the perfect city for business tourism.

Abidjan also has beaches around the lagoon, with palm and coconut trees, in the [[Vridi]] area, which are very popular at weekends with the picturesque sight of the pineapple and coconut sellers. Nevertheless, the rip-tides which affects practically the whole of the Gulf of Guinea's coast, means that in this area swimming is not usually allowed. Generally, in Cote d'Ivoire, tourism has never really been developed as an economic industry; the country is not much of a common holiday destination.

==== Parc du Banco (Banco National Park) ====
[[File:Laundry in the river.jpg|left|thumb|Fanicos, Abidjan's washermen]]

Converted in 1926, this park has 3,000 hectares and ancient "sacred wood" lies at the entrance to the city, in the [[Attécoubé]] community, which has been conserved as a relic of the first forest which surrounded the lagoon in the past. A tarmaced road goes straight to the lake at the heart of the park and trails go throughout it. The park is inhabited and there are coffee and [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] plantations.

At the edge of the park, a small river serves as a wash-house where the ''fanicos'', laundry men, work after collecting the laundry from the whole of the city. It is one of the 'small jobs' which exist in Abidjan.

==== Nightlife ====
Overall, the nightlife in Abidjan is considered to be one of the liveliest in the whole of Africa.

The district has an abundance of night-clubs, maquis, out-door areas, and go-go bars. These entertainment platforms provide a musical 'pipeline' encompassing mainly DJs, [[Coupé Décalé]] and [[Zouglou]], and, in lesser amounts, other local and international varieties.

Formerly containing only local traditional varieties, Congolese music and Western music, Abidjan's night life has experienced a positive cultural disruption in its music since the start of the 2000s, with the arrival of [[Coupé Décalé]].

This musical genre was introduced in 2002 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Douk Saga|fr}} and {{Interlanguage link multi|La Jet Set|fr}}, with the help of Sagacité, created a phenomenon which has not stopped spreading and reaching out to the hot nights in the capitals of the sub-region. It has given a globally identifiable cultural identity to entertainment 'made in Côte d'Ivoire'.

The very popular Zouglou additionally benefits "Wôyô" spaces; furnished and dedicated so that the most famous, the Internat at Fitini's and the Lycee at Vieux Gazeur's, attract 'zouglouphiles' the whole weekend.

[[Treichville]], with its many maquis, discothèques, and jazz clubs, used to be the liveliest area in the city, but since the end of the 1990s [[Youpougon]], [[Marcory]], and [[Cocody]] have taken over this role.

=== Music ===
Abidjan is a turntable for West African music, and a major producer of musical art in Africa. The city attracts the majority of musicians from the Côte d'Ivoire mainly because of its many [[dance clubs]], which allow artists to make their debut and express themselves, record companies and national media. Here are a few examples of the most popular artists to have made their debut in Abidjan: [[Alpha Blondy]], [[Aïcha Koné]], the group [[Magic System]], [[Meiway]], and [[Tiken Jah Fakoly]], as well as [[Gadji Celi]], [[Chantal Taiba]], [[Nayanka Bell]], [[DJ Arafat]]. In the 1980s [[Miriam Makeba]] came to Abidjan when she was not allowed back to her own country, [[South Africa]], as did the Congolese diva [[Tshala Muana]], apostle of the Soukous style of dance.

Since the 1990s, Abidjan has had a significant variety of musical styles being exported throughout Africa and the West. These are [[Zoblazo]], [[Mapouka]], [[Zouglou]] and, since 2002, the [[Coupé-Décalé]]; the popularity and great variety of these dances make the city a kind of African dance and musical trend capital. Congo-Kinshasa formerly held this title, with [[Congolese rumba|rumba]], [[soukous]] and then [[ndombolo]]. Abidjan is also considered the reggae capital of Africa.

Each year, the city organises the following music festivals:

* Abi-Reggae &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abireggae.ci}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faya Flow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abidjanshow.com/a_videobox_suite.php?newsid=1385 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219211007/http://abidjanshow.com/a_videobox_suite.php?newsid=1385 |archivedate=2009-02-19 |title=Fayaflow résumé de l'édition 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media ===
{{see also|Media of Côte d'Ivoire}}
Most mass media in Côte d'Ivoire can be found in Abidjan.

==== Television and radio ====
The National Council for Audio-visual Communication (CNCA) is the regulating authority of audio-visual material in Côte d'Ivoire.

[[Radiodiffusion Television Ivoirienne]] (RTI) is the radio and television broadcasting authority for Côte d'Ivoire; it is financed by licence fees, publicity and grants. RTI has four television channels and two radio stations: ''La Première'' (non-specialised), ''TV2'', ''RTI Music TV'', ''RTI Sport TV'', ''Radio Côte d'Ivoire'', and ''Fréquence 2'' (non-specialised radio). ''Radio Jam'' is a private radio station in Côte d'Ivoire and is most listened to by young people.

With regards to private channels, [[Tam-Tam TV]] will be the first International Côte d'Ivoire television channel with headquarters in Abidjan, with other studios in the [[United States]], [[Italy]], [[France]], Asia, the Middle East.

There are also several Côte d'Ivoire TV channels or radio stations available on the Internet: ''Africahit'', ''Music TV'', ''Abidjan.net TV'', ''Bengueshow'', etc.

With the launch in 2015 of DISCOP Africa Abidjan, the city became a hub for TV market professionals from French-speaking Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://discopafrica.com/introducing-discop-africa-express/ |title=Intro to Discop Africa Abidjan |publisher=discopafrica.com |accessdate=9 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928224437/http://discopafrica.com/introducing-discop-africa-express/ |archive-date=28 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Press ====
At the time of the single-party, a political situation which ruled over the country for 30 years like most other [[West African countries]] after independence, only one daily newspaper was distributed throughout the country: [[Fraternité Matin]], from the parliamentary group [[PDCI-RDA]], which was founded by the first president, [[Félix Houphouët-Boigny]]. The advent of multiple parties in Côte d'Ivoiret in 1999 can be seen in the proliferation of newspapers and diverse publications, of which the majority is published in Abidjan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.abidjan.net/titrologie |title=Titrologie de la presse ivoirienne |publisher=News.abidjan.net |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abidjan is the centre of Ivorian rugby, and most of the [[Côte d'Ivoiret national rugby union team]] come from here. Although the origins of Ivorian rugby go back to the 1960s and earlier, French official [[Jean-François Turon]] managed the team at [[Université Félix Houphouët-Boigny|Abidjan University]] in the 1980s, but it was [[François Dali]] who created Ivorian rugby, and his son was the national captain during the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Completerugby&gt;Bath, Richard (ed.)

The complex will have, in addition to areas for all different Olympic disciplines (football, athletics, [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], etc.), restaurants, shops, auditoriums, conference rooms, a hotel for the sportspeople, and training areas. Since the sudden increase in Ivorian football, the government believes that the national team deserves a better stadium. Although, there was a problem with the "Félicia": it is impossible to increase its size due to its location in Le Plateau. The project for the new complex was suspended {{As of|2011|lc=on}} because of a lack of investors and the political situation which the country has been experiencing since December 1999.

[[File:Antonin Gindely 1878 HumL.jpg|thumb|Antonín Gindely (1878)]]
'''Anton Gindely''' ({{lang-cs|Antonín Gindely}}, 3 September 1829, Prague{{snd}}24 October 1892) was a [[Bohemia]]n historian, a son of an [[Hungarian German]] father and a [[Czechs|Czech]] mother, born in [[Prague]].

He studied in Prague and in [[Palacký University of Olomouc|Olomouc]], and, after travelling extensively in search of historical material, became professor of history at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|German Charles-Ferdinand University]] of Prague and archivist for Bohemia in 1862. He died in Prague.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Gindely, Anton|volume=12|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gindely's chief work is his ''Geschichte des dreissigjährigen Krieges'' (Prague, 1869–1880), which has been translated into English (New York, 1884); and his historical work is mainly concerned with the period of the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Perhaps the most important of his numerous other works are:
* ''Geschichte der böhmischen Brüder'' (Prague, 1857–1858)
* ''Rudolf II. und seine Zeit''(1862–1868)
* A criticism of [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|Wallenstein]], ''Waldstein während seines ersten Generalats'' (1886)&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;
He wrote a history of [[Bethlen Gabor]] in Hungarian, and edited the ''Monumenta historiae Bohemica''. Gindely's posthumous work, ''Geschichte der Gegenreformation in Böhmen'', was edited by T. Tupetz (1894).&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7007">'''Arab archery''' is the traditional style of [[archery]] practiced by the [[Arab]] peoples of the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] from ancient to modern times.

==Release Style==
The style of Arab archery described in the extant texts (all of which date long after the Mongol conquests and the widespread use of Turkish [[Mamluk]] slaves as soldiers) is similar to the styles used by Mongol and Turkish archers, drawing with a [[Bow draw|thumb draw]] and using a [[thumb ring]] to protect the right thumb.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson, W. F. 1966. "The Archers of Islam." Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient. Vol. 9, No. 1/2 (Nov., 1966), pp. 69-87.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archerylibrary.com/books/faris-elmer/arab-archery/docs/xlii.html|title=XLII. On thumb-tips and the various kind thereof, from: Arab Archery, by N.A. Faris and R.P. Elmer, 1945.|author=Marcelo Muller|work=archerylibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab Archery History==
In 70 ce the town of Emesa (modern-day [[Homs]], some 160 kilometers north of [[Damascus]]) sent archers to aid the Roman siege of Jerusalem. [[Hadrian]] knew Syria, having first visited in 117 and again in 123, shortly after his visit to Britannia. A [[Headstone]] of a Syrian archer was found along [[Hadrian's Wall]], and dates from the 2nd century [[Common Era]], when 200 Syrian archers were sent to reinforce the 8,000 Roman soldiers. The tombstone is now displayed at the [[Great North Museum: Hancock]]. Field archaeologist Mike Bishop, however, contends that everyone hunted, and the primary value of the Syrian archers was tactical—on the battlefield. Their bows, he explains, were [[Composite bow]]s (also called “recurved”), capable of longer range than common longbows. “Correct and effective use of the composite bow,” Bishop adds, “took a lifetime to master, so Eastern recruits were essential.”&lt;ref&gt;Cecil, Charles O. 2017. [http://www.aramcoworld.com/en-US/Articles/July-2017/Hadrian-s-Syrians-1 Hadrian's Syrians]. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/949793337 Aramco World]. August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab archers used [[composite bows]] from foot, horse, and camel, to good effect from the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;KUNSELMAN, DAVID E. 2007. [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a494014.pdf ARAB-BYZANTINE WAR, 629-644 AD]. Page 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archery in Islam==
[[Muhammad]] was quite good with a bow, and appreciated the benefits of archery in sports and warfare. A [[Bow shape#Recurve bow|recurved bow]] made of bamboo, and ascribed to Muhammad, is held in the [[Sacred Relics (Topkapı Palace)]] in the Chamber of the Sacred Relics in the Topkapi Museum in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ee.bilkent.edu.tr/~history/religious.html|title=Sacred Relics|work=bilkent.edu.tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several comments by Mohammad concerning archery in the [[Hadith]]. [[Umm Salama]] told of Muhammed coming upon two groups practicing archery, and he praised them.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 4, Book 56, Number 710.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Malik ibn Anas]] spoke about when at the [[battle of Uhud]], the troops left Muhammad behind, where the archer, Abu [[Talhah]], remained behind and protected the Prophet with his shield.&lt;ref&gt;Volume 5, Book 58, Number 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uqbah ibn Amir]] relates how Muhammad said that archery shooting was more dear to him than riding.&lt;ref&gt;Book 14, Number 2507.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prophet owned six bows: az-Zawra’, ar-Rauha’, as-Safra’, al-Bayda’, al-Katum – which was broke during the battle of [[Battle of Uhud]], and was taken by Qatadah bin an-Nu’man – and as-Saddad. The Prophet had a quiver called al-Kafur, and a strap for it made from tanned skin, as well as three silver circular rings, a buckle, and an edge made of silver. We should mention that Ibn Taymiyyah said that there are no authentic narrations that the Prophet ever wore a strap around his waist.&lt;ref&gt;Abu Maryah. 2008. [https://scholarsandmartyrs.wordpress.com/2008/02/20/the-weapons-of-the-prophet-muhammad/ "Weapons of the Prophet Muhammad"]. February 20, 2008. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Arab Archery Today==
There are a number of Arab Archery clubs and societies today. Some practice the traditional Arab archery, while others use Western styles of archery in sport competition and hunting.
The main organization is FATA, or the "Fédération Arabe de Tir a L'Arc" of Lebanon, a member of the [[World Archery Federation]]. 
The [[Pan Arab Games]] usually have an archery competition, and the 12th Arab Games&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldarchery.org/OTHEREVENTS/Others/2011/Doha-ArabGames/TabId/1124/ArtMID/1567/ArticleID/470/Successful-Archery-Competition-at-the-12th-Arab-Games-.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Qatar]] held in 2011 had 60 archers from nine Arab countries compete.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15273">{{DISPLAYTITLE:''Brut'' Chronicle}}
The '''''Brut'' Chronicle''', also known as the '''Prose ''Brut''''', is the collective name of a number of [[medieval]] [[chronicle]]s of the history of England. The original Prose ''Brut'' was written in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]; it was subsequently translated into Latin and English. The chronicle begins England's history with the mythological founding of Britain by [[Brutus of Troy]], named "Brut" in French and English; Brutus is the legendary great-grandson of [[Aeneas]] and his founding of Britain thus links that country to the grand history of [[Troy]].

The first Anglo-Norman versions end with the death of [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] in 1272; subsequent versions extend the narrative. Fifty versions in Anglo-Norman remain, in forty-nine manuscripts, in a variety of versions and stages.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Latin translations of the Anglo-Norman versions remain in nineteen different versions, which fall into two main categories; some of those were subsequently translated into [[Middle English]].&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than 184 versions of the English translation of the work in 181 medieval and post-medieval manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the highest number of manuscripts for any text in Middle English except for [[Wycliffe's Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Matheson ix.&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer number of copies that survive and its late-fourteenth century translation into the [[vernacular]] indicating the growth in common [[literacy]];&lt;ref&gt;Myers 38.&lt;/ref&gt; it is considered "central" to the literary culture of late-medieval England.&lt;Ref&gt;Ruddick 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and subsequent history ==
[[File:Brut Chronicle.jpg|thumb|A page from Caxton's printing, describing the [[Percy-Neville feud]] of 1454]]

Originally a [[legend]]ary chronicle written in Anglo-Norman in the thirteenth century (identified by the fact that some existing copies finish in 1272), the ''Brut'' described the settling of England by [[Brutus of Troy]], son of [[Aeneas]], and the reign of the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[Cadwaladr|Cadwalader]].&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt; In this, it was itself based on [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s text from the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick 39.&lt;/ref&gt; It also covered the reigns of many kings later the subject of legend, including [[King Cole]], [[Leir of Britain|King Leir]] (the subject of [[Shakespeare]]'s play, [[King Lear]]), and [[King Arthur]], and exists in both abridged and long versions.&lt;ref name=szarmach&gt;Szarmach, P.E, M T. Tavormina, and J.T. Rosenthal (eds), ''Medieval England: An Encyclopedia'' (New York, 1998), 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions describe the country as being divided, both culturally and politically, by the [[Humber|River Humber]], with the southern half described as "this side of the Humber" and "the better part".&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Having been written at a time of [[Magna Carta|division between crown and nobility]], it was "baronial in its sympathies".&lt;ref&gt;Marvin 2013, 169.&lt;/ref&gt; It was probably originally composed "at least in part" by [[Clerk|clerks]] in the [[Chancery (medieval office)|Royal chancery]],&lt;ref name="Kooper2008" /&gt; although not as an official history.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor 11.&lt;/ref&gt; It later became a source for monastic chronicles.&lt;ref name="Kooper2008"&gt;King and Marvin 135ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular already in its early incarnations, it may even have limited the circulation of rival contemporary histories.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Brut'' underwent various revisions over the centuries, and from 1333 material inflected from a mid-thirteenth century poem, ''[[Des Grantz Geanz]]'', describing the settlement of England (as [[Albion]]), had entered the main versions.&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt; Eventually, along with the ''[[Polychronicon]]'', it was one of the most popular political and secular histories of fourteenth-century England,&lt;ref&gt;Gransden 73.&lt;/ref&gt; with the latest-known version ending with events from 1479.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

English editions appeared from the early 1400s, particularly the so-called Long version and its various continuations. This{{explain|which|date=May 2017}} has become known as the "Common" version, and was probably transcribed in [[Herefordshire]]. A later fifteenth-century version consists of the Common versions with "a major one" concluding in 1419, occasionally with the addition of [[Prologue|prologues]] and [[Epilogue|epilogues]]. The 1500s also saw an abridged version, created from the major fifteenth-century copies.&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt;

===Audience===
It was primarily of interest to the upper-[[gentry]] and the [[English nobility]], but, the more it got added to and altered, so it became  noticed by other sectors of society.&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt; Firstly the clergy, for whom it was translated into Latin,&lt;ref&gt;Myers 38.&lt;/ref&gt; and then into the more accessible French and then English for the lower gentry and [[mercantile]] classes.&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt; It was thus available to much of English society; certainly, as Andrea Ruddock has said, to the entire political class. And, since it only took "one literate person to make a text available to an entire household", its circulation could have been even broader.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, there are vast differences in the quality of the surviving manuscripts, and Julia Marvin has suggested that this reflects their "diverse ownership and readership".&lt;ref&gt;Marvin 2013, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a tremendous success",&lt;ref&gt;Marvin 2005, 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most-copied chronicles of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin 2013, 170.&lt;/ref&gt; A version produced in [[York]] in the later fourteenth century was based on official contemporary records, and contains, for example, an eye-witness account of the [[Good Parliament]] of 1376.&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick 94.&lt;/ref&gt; The post-1399 versions are notable by their clear pro-[[House of Lancaster|Lancastrian]] bias and focus on [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]]'s victories in France, for example at [[Siege of Rouen|Rouen]], for the purposes of [[propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;Gransden 467.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1999, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; However, even these later versions still contained much of the earlier legendary material, such as that of Albina;&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick 69.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, the prose versions have been described as being "enthusiastic" in its rendition of these aspects of English history.&lt;ref&gt;Spence 75.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been described as "one of the best records of rumours and propaganda, if not of the event themselves."{{Sfn|Valente|1998|p=854}}

== Medieval publication history ==
There are fifty versions in [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]], in forty-nine [[manuscript]]s, in various versions and stages.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt; There are Latin translations of the Anglo-Norman versions in nineteen different versions, which fall into two main categories; some of those were subsequently translated into [[Middle English]].&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no fewer than 184 versions of the English translation of the work in 181 medieval and post-medieval manuscripts,&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; the highest number of manuscripts for any text in Middle English except for [[Wycliffe's Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;Matheson ix.&lt;/ref&gt; From the fifteenth century there is "an amorphous, heterogenous group" of texts which are composed of individual's notes and preliminary workings of various areas of the ''Brut''.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden ??&lt;/ref&gt; The English edition made it the first chronicle to be written in the vernacular since the ninth-century [[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Gransden 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the "massive scribal activity" that produced over 250 extant manuscripts (a "vast number for a medieval text"&lt;ref&gt;Ruddick 39.&lt;/ref&gt;), the ''Brut'' was the first chronicle printed in England. The ''Brut'' was one of [[William Caxton]]'s first [[Printing press|printings]], and he may have compiled this version himself.&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt; Between 1480, when Caxton printed it as the ''Chronicles of England'', and 1528 it went through thirteen editions. As a result, according to Matheson, "it is no exaggeration to say that in the late Middle Ages in England the ''Brut'' was the standard historical account of British and English history".&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tudor historians such as [[John Stow]], [[Raphael Holinshed]], and [[Edward Hall]] relied extensively on the ''Brut'', and so, by extension, did William Shakespeare.&lt;ref name=szarmach/&gt;

===Anglo-Norman versions===
The Anglo-Norman text was initially intended for a lay audience of the upper class. Likely and certain owners of versions of the ''Brut'' included [[Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick]], [[Henry de Lacy, 3rd Earl of Lincoln]], [[Isabella of France]] (who gave a copy to her son, [[Edward III of England]]), and [[Thomas Ughtred, 1st Baron Ughtred]] (in his will he left it to his wife). Copies were also listed in the library catalogs of religious houses--[[Fountains Abbey]], [[Hailes Abbey]], [[Clerkenwell Priory]], and [[St Mary's Abbey, York]] (which had two copies). Matheson lists five manuscripts of continental providence, produced in France, Flanders, and Lorraine.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle English versions===
Outside the traditional lay, upper-class audience, the reach of the Middle English translations of the ''Brut'' extended the audience to the merchant class. Landowning gentry with a Middle English copy of the ''Brut'' include [[John Sulyard]]'s father, who passed it on to [[Henry Bourchier, 2nd Earl of Essex]]'s son Thomas. [[John Warkworth]] of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]], owned a copy (which included the {{'}}Warkworth{{'}}s{{'}} ''Chronicle'', named for him&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;), as did the religious houses [[St Bartholomew-the-Great]] and [[Dartford Priory]], among others. Matheson identifies a number of women owners and readers as well: Isabel Alen (niece of vicar William Trouthe), Alice Brice, Elizabeth Dawbne, and Dorothy Helbartun.&lt;ref&gt;Matheson 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historiography and publication ==
The Brut's significance is now seen as being in the fact that it was written by laymen, for laymen, and also that the latter portion, at least, was one of the first chronicles written in the [[English language]]; it also occasionally provides historical details not found in other contemporaries' writings.&lt;ref&gt;Myers 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brut owned by the [[Mortimer]] family in the late fourteenth-century contained their view of their own [[genealogy]] (which they also traced back to King Arthur and Brutus).&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy 1999, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scholarly edition of the later-medieval portion was transcribed and edited by [[J.S. Davies]] for the [[Camden Society]] in 1856, and in 1879 [[James Gairdner]] published parts of it relating to the [[Hundred Years' War]] in his ''Historical Recollections of a London Citizen''. In 1905, [[Charles Lethbridge Kingsford|C.S.L. Kingsford]] published three versions in his ''Chronicles of London'',&lt;ref&gt;Myers 42.&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year F.W.D. Brie published a list of all extant manuscripts in his ''The Brute of England or The Chronicles of England.''&lt;ref&gt;Brie 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not often visited because of its remote location and low tourist profile. The remains on the site resemble those of other archaeological sites in the [[Great Zimbabwe]] tradition. The Bumbusi National Monument consists of colossal stone walls, boulders, platforms and the ruins of dwellings. Its main structures date from the eighteenth and nineteenth century. Excavations in 2000 revealed the floors of eighteen original dwellings. The site was declared a National Monument in 1946. In 2008 it was listed in the World Monuments Watch List of 100 of Most Endangered Sites by the [[World Monuments Fund]] because of the threats posed to the sandstone walls by wild animals from the surrounding nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wmf.org/project/bumbusi-national-monument |title=Bumbusi National Monument |date=2008 |website= |publisher=World Monuments Fund |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cave of Treasures''''', sometimes referred to simply as '''''The Treasure''''', is a book of the [[New Testament apocrypha]]. It was written in the sixth century or later.

==Origin==
This text is attributed to [[Ephraim the Syrian|Ephrem Syrus]], who was born at [[Nisibis]] soon after AD 306 and died in 373, but it is now generally believed that its current form is 6th century or newer.

The assertion that the ''Cave of Treasures'' was written in the 4th century is supported by the general contents of the work. These reproduce Ephrem's peculiar methods of exegesis and supply many examples of his methods in religious argument, with which we are familiar from his other writings. His pride in the antiquity of the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] language also appears in this work. That it was written in [[Mesopotamia]] by a Syrian, there is no doubt, and if Ephrem was not the original author, or perhaps later editor, belonged to the school of Ephrem.

The oldest Christian work on the history of God's dealing with man from Adam to Christ is probably the anonymous ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'', which, in its original form, is from the 5th or 6th century AD. The writer of the ''Cave of Treasures'' borrowed largely from the ''Conflict of Adam and Eve'', or shared a common source with it.

==History==
The ''Cave of Treasures'' was introduced to the world by [[Giuseppe Simone Assemani]], the author of the Catalogues of Oriental Manuscripts in the Vatican Library, which he printed in ''Bibliotheca Orientalis'' in four thick volumes folio. In Vol. ii. page 498 he describes a Syriac manuscript containing a series of apocryphal works, and among them is one the title of which he translates ''Spelunca Thesaurorum.'' He saw that the manuscript contained the history of 5,500 years, from the creation of Adam to the birth of Christ, and that it was based upon the [[Scriptures]]. He says that fables are found in it everywhere, especially concerning the [[antediluvian]] [[Patriarchs]], and the genealogy of Christ and His Mother. He mentions that the Patriarch [[Patriarch Eutychius of Alexandria|Eutychius]] also describes a cave of treasures in which gold, [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]] were laid up, and refers to the "portentosa feminarum nomina," women of Jesus' ancestry. No attempt was made to publish the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] text; in fact, little attention was paid to it until [[August Dillmann]] began to study the ''Conflict of Adam and Eve'' in connection with it, and then he showed in [[Ewald (martyr)|Ewald]]'s ''Jahrbüchern'' (Bd. V. 1853) that the contents of whole sections of the ''Book of the Cave of Treasures'' in Syriac and the ''Conflict of Adam and Eve'' in Ethiopic were identical. And soon after this, Dillmann and others noticed that an [[Clementine literature|Arabic manuscript in the Vatican]] (No. XXXIX; see Assemânî, Bibl. Orient. i. page 281) contained a version of the ''Cave of Treasures'', which had clearly been made from the Syriac. In 1883 [[Carl Bezold]] published a translation of the Syriac text of the "Cave of Treasures" made from three manuscripts (Die Schatzhöhle, Leipzig, 1883), and five years later published the Syriac text of it, accompanied by the text of the Arabic version.
Some passages from the ''Cave of Treasures'' are also found in the [[Coptic language|Coptic]] ''Enconium of Mary Magdalene'' of Pseudo-Cyril.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marquis |first=Christine Luckritz |chapter=An Enconium of Mary Magdalene: A new translation and introduction |editor-last=Landau | editor-first=B. | title=New Testament Apocrypha: More Noncanonical Scriptures | publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company | volume=1 | year=2016 | isbn=978-0-8028-7289-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fp8xDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA197 |p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the subsequent history of the Syriac ''Cave of Treasures'', little is known. The knowledge of parts of it made its way into Armenia soon after the book was written, and more than one translation of it was made into Arabic, probably in the 7th and 8th centuries. In connection with the Arabic translations, they all end with the account of the cruelties perpetrated by [[Herod Archelaus|Archelaus]] and Sâlûm after the death of [[Herod the Great|Herod]]. (See Bezold's text, page 247.) The last paragraph of the Arabic text mentions the twelve Apostles who went about with Christ, and refers to His baptism by John the Baptist, and says that He lived on the earth thirty-three years, and then ascended into heaven. Thus for the last twenty-six pages of the Syriac text there is no equivalent in the Arabic version. The same is substantially true for the Ethiopic ''Conflict of Adam and Eve''. The section of the Syriac for which there is no rendering in Arabic or Ethiopic contains a series of statements addressed to the author's "brother Nemesius." It is possible but unlikely that these were added to the work by a later writer. As they do not deal with matters of genealogy, and deal almost exclusively with Jesus Christ's life and crucifixion, they probably failed to interest the Arab translator, and he left them untranslated, unless parts of the original Arabic translation have perished.

That the Syriac ''Cave of Treasures'' was known and used by Solomon, Bishop of Perâth Maishân ([[Basra|Al-Basrah]]) in 1222 is proved by the earlier chapters of his work the ''[[Book of the Bee]]''. He excerpted from it many of the legends of the early Patriarchs, although his object was not to write a table of genealogical succession, but a full history of the Christian Dispensation according to the views of the [[Nestorian Church|Nestorians]]. The best manuscript of the ''Cave of Treasures'' which we have to the Nestorians, for Brit. Mus. MS. Add. 25875, was written by a Nestorian scribe in the Nestorian village of Alkôsh, and was bound up by him in a volume which included a copy of the ''Book of the Bee'', whose author, Solomon, was the Nestorian Bishop of Al-Basrah early in the 13th century.

==Contents==
The author of the ''Cave of Treasures'' called his work "The Book of the order of the succession of Generations (or Families)," the Families being those of the Patriarchs and [[Kings of Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]; and his chief object was to show how Christ was descended from Adam. He did not accept the genealogical tables which were commonly in use among his unlearned fellow-Christians, because he was convinced that all the ancient tables of genealogies which the Jews had possessed were destroyed by fire by the captain of [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s army immediately after the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. The Jews promptly constructed new tables of genealogies, which both Christians and Arabs regarded as fictitious. The Arabs were as deeply interested in the matter as the Christians, for they were descended from [[Abraham]], and the genealogy of the descendants of [[Hagar]] and [[Ishmael]] was of the greatest importance in their sight, and it is due to their earnest desire to possess correct genealogical tables of their ancestors that we owe the Arabic translations of the ''Cave of Treasures''. The [[Nubians]] and Egyptians were also interested in such matters, for the former were the legendary descendants of Kûsh, and the latter the descendants of [[Mizraim]], and [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]] was the great ancestor of both these nations.  It is clear that medieval Syrians, Arabs, Egyptians and Ethiopians regarded the ''Cave of Treasures'' as an authoritative work on their respective pedigrees.

In the title ''Cave of Treasures'' which was given to the "Book of the order of the succession of Generations" there is probably a double allusion, namely, to the Book as the storehouse of literary treasures, and to the legendarily famous cave in which Adam and Eve were made to dwell by God after their expulsion from [[Garden of Eden|Paradise]], which was said to contain gold, and frankincense, and myrrh and was thus commonly called "The Cave of Treasures" (in Syriac, ''Me`ârath Gazzê'', in Arabic, ''Ma`ârah al-Kanûz'', and in Ethiopic, ''Ba`âta Mazâgebet'').

The Syriac ''Cave of Treasures'' tells us very little about the supposed physical attritubes of the cave, said to be situated in the side of a mountain below Paradise, and nothing about Adam and Eve's way of life there. But in the "Book of Adam and Eve", the whole of the first main section is devoted to details of the physical cave.

[[File:Christoph Brouwer.jpg|thumb|right|Christoph Brouwer]]
'''Christoph Brouwer''' (or ''Browerius'') (12 March 1559 &amp;ndash; 1617) was a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest of [[the Netherlands]], and ecclesiastical historian. He is particularly known for his contribution to the history of the [[Archdiocese of Trier]].

==Life==
Brouwer was born in [[Arnhem]], [[The Netherlands]]. In 1580 he entered the [[Society of Jesus]], and after a thorough humanistic training, devoted himself especially to the study of [[church history]]. His attainments in other branches of learning are shown by his appointment as professor of philosophy at Trier; later he was appointed rector, first at [[Fulda]], and then at Trier. His chief work was entitled: ''Antiquitates et annales Trevirenses et episcoporum Treverensis ecclesiae suffragorum''. The work extends to the year 1600 and was prepared at the request of two archbishops, Johann VII of Schoenenberg and Lothar of Mitternich, with the intent to disprove the partisan publication of Hermann (Kyriander), Syndic of Trier. Hermann's work was published in 1576 and was written to support the claims of the city against the rights of the archbishop.

Brouwer devoted the greater part of his life to the preparation of his book and, according to the testimony of the historian [[Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim]], he is deserving of undying honor for his contribution to the history of the [[Diocese of Trier|Archbishopric of Trier]]. Unfortunately, he did not live to complete his task. Brouwer's unflinching love of truth and his true [[historical method]] were not agreeable to the councilors of the archbishop; so, although the publication of his work had been sanctioned by the authorities of his order, it could not be issued. It was not until 1626 that the work of printing his manuscript at [[Cologne]] could be undertaken, and then only after important alterations had been made in the text. New difficulties arose when the eighteenth book was in press. The completion of the printing was forbidden and all the sheets already struck off were suppressed as much as possible, so that only a few copies have come down to us. Brouwer's labors were continued from 1600 to 1652 by [[Jacob Masenius]], who issued the whole work in revised form in 1670 in two folio volumes at [[Liège (city)|Liege]].

Brouwer was unable to complete his other great work, which was entitled ''Metropolis Ecclesiae Trevericae''. It was intended to contain a description of all the cities, churches, and monasteries in the Archdiocese of Trier. This work did not appear until 1855-56, when it was issued at [[Koblenz]] in two volumes by [[Johann Christian von Stramberg|Christian vom Stramberg]]. The edition does not meet fully the demands of our time; nevertheless it contains much that is useful. Brouwer's history of the [[Diocese of Fulda]] is also worthy of mention. It is entitled: ''Fuldensium antiquitatum libri 4'' (Antwerp, 1612). Of less importance is the work issued at [[Mainz]] in 1616, entitled ''Sidera illustrium et sanctorum virorum, qui Germaniam ornarunt''. Among the results of his humanistic studies is the edition of the works of Bishop [[Venantius Fortunatus]], which was issued at Mainz in 1603, together with a life of [[Saint Martin of Tours]]. A second edition appeared in 1617 augmented by the annotated poems of Archbishop [[Rabanus Maurus]].

He died in [[Trier]], [[Germany]].

[[The Beatles]] were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1960. With members [[John Lennon]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|id=mn0000754032|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as "[[Beatlemania]]", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters [[Lennon–McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]], the band were integral to pop music's [[Art music#Popular music|evolution into an art form]] and to the development of the [[counterculture of the 1960s]].{{sfn|Frontani|2007|p=125}}

Their continued commercial and critical success assisted many cultural movements—including a shift from American artists' global dominance of [[rock and roll]] to British acts ([[British Invasion]]), the proliferation of young musicians in the 1960s who formed new bands, the [[LP record|album]] as the dominant form of record consumption over [[Single (music)|singles]], the term "[[Beatlesque]]" used to describe similar-sounding artists, and several fashion trends. At the height of their popularity, Lennon controversially remarked that the group had become "[[more popular than Jesus]]". The Beatles were still challenged for record sales and artistic prestige, mainly by [[the Beach Boys]], [[Bob Dylan]], and [[the Rolling Stones]]. Many of the Beatles' music experiments were also not without precedent. However, no other acts provoked as many changes in the pop mainstream than the Beatles or Dylan, having opened new spaces for creative advancement and exploiting them to an exceeding degree. The Beatles' innovations notably contributed to the new [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] and [[progressive music]], and some of the band's unusual [[The Beatles' recording technology|production techniques]] later became part of normal recording practice.

As of 2009, the Beatles are the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling band]] in history, with estimated claimed sales of over 600 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name="staff1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/09/04/news/companies/beatles_video_game/|title=Beatles' remastered box set, video game out|date=9 September 2009|publisher=[[CNNMoney.com]]|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hotten1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19800654|title=The Beatles at 50: From Fab Four to fabulously wealthy|last=Hotten|first=Russell|date=4 October 2012 |publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have had more number-one albums on the British charts, fifteen,{{sfn|Glennie|2012}} and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act.{{sfn|Official Chart Company|2012}} They ranked number one on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary.{{sfn|Billboard|2008a}} {{As of|2016}}, they hold the record for most number-one hits on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, with twenty.&lt;ref name="hot100"&gt;{{cite web|first=Gary|last=Trust|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7263992/rihanna-hot-100-no-1-fifth-week-ariana-grande-debuts|title=Rihanna Rules Hot 100 for Fifth Week, Ariana Grande Debuts at No. 10 |date=21 March 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They've also had [[List of artists who have covered The Beatles|myriad cover versions from a variety of artists]], while "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]" is one of the most covered songs in the history of recorded music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Guinness World Records]] |year=2009 |title=Most Recorded Song |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50867 |accessdate=12 May 2009 |ref={{SfnRef|Guinness World Records|2009}} |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910071729/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/content_pages/record.asp?recordid=50867 |archivedate=10 September 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Beatles were collectively included in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's compilation of [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|the twentieth century's 100 most influential people]].{{sfn|Loder|1998}} In 2017, a study of [[AllMusic]]'s catalog indicated the Beatles as the most frequently cited artist influence in its database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kopf|first1=Dan|last2=Wong|first2=Amy X.|title=A definitive list of the musicians who influenced our lives most|url=https://qz.com/1094962/a-definitive-list-of-the-musicians-who-influenced-our-lives-most/|website=Quartz|date=October 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beatles with Ed Sullivan.jpg|thumb|right|With Ed Sullivan, February 1964]]

Regarding the ever-changing landscapes of popular music, musicologist Allan Moore notes; "Sometimes, audiences gravitate towards a centre. The most prominent period when this happened was in the early to mid 1960s when it seems that almost everyone, irrespective of age, class or cultural background, listened to the Beatles."{{sfn|Moore|2016|pp=199–200}}{{refn|group=nb|However, as he continues, "by 1970 this monolothic position had again broken down. Both [[the Edgar Broughton Band]]'s '[[Apache Dropout|Apache dropout]]' and [[Edison Lighthouse]]'s '[[Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)|Love grows]]' were released in 1970 with strong Midlands/London connections, and both were audible on the same radio stations, but were operating according to very different aesthetics."{{sfn|Moore|2016|pp=199–200}}}} On 9 February 1964, the Beatles gave their first live US television performance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households,{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=137}} or 34 per cent of the American population.  Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating service, it was "the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television {{lang|en-US|program}}".{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=3}}

The Beatles subsequently sparked the [[British Invasion]] of the US{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=277}} and became a globally influential phenomenon.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=8}} During the previous four decades, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] movies, [[jazz]], the music of Broadway and [[Tin Pan Alley]] and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=9}} On 4 April 1964, the Beatles occupied the top five US chart positions, as well as 11 other positions in the [[Billboard Hot 100|Top 100]].{{sfn|MacDonald|2007|p=417}} As of 2013, they remain the only act to have done so, having also broken 11 other chart records in the ''Billboard'' Top 100 and ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caulfield|first1=Keith|last2=Trust|first2=Gary|last3=Letkemann|first3=Jessica|title=The Beatles' American Chart Invasion: 12 Record-Breaking Hot 100 &amp; Billboard 200 Feats|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/5901089/the-beatles-american-chart-invasion-12-record-breaking-hot-100|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Luis Sanchez wrote: "to grasp the mania that persists in our collective imagination is to follow the proselytizing drift of a question like 'Who is your favorite Beatle?'"{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=73}}  By August 1965, they "had transformed into an abstraction of their own success, a phenomenon to be devoured rather than heard. The pressure of that phenomenon led to one of the most mythologized of pop career reversals. ... quietly resigning from the drudge of touring to get serious about their art."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=73}}

The Beatles maintained their most significant competition with [[Bob Dylan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaiser|1988|p=199}}: "their most important rival" {{harvnb|Robins|2016|p=103}}: "the Beatles' main rival."&lt;/ref&gt; [[the Rolling Stones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=211}}: "the Beatles' only serious competitor, in terms of popularity, prestige, and musical influence"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[the Beach Boys]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|p=102}}: "When the British Invasion took hold of the American teen consciousness in 1964, [the Beach Boys] posed the only serious threat to the Fab Four's chart supremacy" {{harvnb|Hall|2014|p=62}}: "for a time … their most consistent American artistic and commercial competition"&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The Beatles kept abreast of their sales rankings in comparison to other groups like the Beach Boys,{{sfn|Runco|2014|p=154}} and often found new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries.{{sfn|Harry|2000|pp=99, 217, 357, 1195}} }} Dylan and the Stones were symbolic of the nascent youth revolt against institutional authority, something that was not immediately recognisable within the Beatles until after 1966.{{sfn|MacDonald|2007|p=28}} The Beatles' initial clean-cut personas contrasted with the Rolling Stones' "bad boy" image, and so the music press forged a rivalry between the two,{{sfn|Fried|Titone|Weiner|1980|p=185}} but as author [[Barry Miles]] says, "[it was] to give themselves something to write about, [and] there was actually no contest between the two groups in anything other than chart positions."{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=280}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1971, Lennon responded to disparaging comments the Stones were making of the Beatles: "I resent the implication that the Rolling Stones are like revolutionaries and that the Beatles weren't. The Stones are not in the same class, music-wise or power-wise, never were."{{sfn|Lange|2008|p=91}}}} The [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] states that, with regard to 1960s rock bands, the Beach Boys "place second only to the Beatles in terms of their overall impact on the [US] top 40" and were the Beatles' "most serious competitors on a creative level, too".{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|pp=42, 47}} Following the widespread changes brought about by the Beatles' arrival in the United States, author [[Mitchell K. Hall]] writes, "for a time the Beach Boys provided the Beatles with their most consistent American artistic and commercial competition."{{sfn|Hall|2014|p=62}} Another group, [[the Byrds]], were widely celebrated as the American answer to the Beatles, and while their long-term influence has proven to be comparable to the Beatles and the Beach Boys, the Byrds' record sales failed to match those groups.{{sfn|Schinder|Schwartz|2008|pp=257–258}}

Dylan is described by [[Ian MacDonald]] as "the only figure to have matched The Beatles' influence on popular culture since 1945"{{sfn|MacDonald|2007|p=124}} and by Charles Kaiser as "their most important rival. ... For the next six years [after 1964], the contest between Dylan and the Beatles would be one of the most productive of all modern musical rivalries. The Beatles made it clear that they regarded Bob Dylan as the musical force to be reckoned with, and Dylan reciprocated these feelings."{{sfn|Kaiser|1988|p=199}} In August 1964, the Beatles met Dylan in person,{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=252}} and he proceeded to introduce them to [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=185}} Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were "perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds": Dylan's audience of "college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style" contrasted with their fans, "veritable '[[teenybopper]]s' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists."{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=252–253}} Within a year, "the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [and the group's] audience&amp;nbsp;... [was] showing signs of growing up."{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=252–253}} In this period, no other acts provoked as many changes in the pop mainstream than the Beatles or Dylan, having opened new spaces for creative advancement and exploiting them to an exceeding degree.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=68}}{{refn|group=nb|Sanchez notes that during the second half of 1965, the Beatles, the Beach Boys, and Dylan all faced the option of "gambling with the audience who granted their music whatever life it had; or they could stay comfortable inside the success they’d already won".{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=69}} After Dylan met the Beatles, he went "[[Electric Dylan controversy|electric]]" in a move that subverted notions of folk [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].{{sfn|Gould|2007|pp=252–253}} }}

According to Simon Philo, the Dylan–Beatles rivalry was "put on hold" after Dylan was left to convalesce from his July 1966 motorcycle accident. Consequently, the Beatles "publicly anointed a new favorite and rival in chief, the Beach Boys' [[Brian Wilson]]".{{sfn|Philo|2014|p=105}} Previously in July 1964, the Beach Boys had achieved their first number one single with "[[I Get Around]]", which represented the start of an unofficial rivalry between the Beatles and Wilson, principally for McCartney.{{sfn|Moskowitz|2015|pp=42, 47}}{{refn|group=nb|By the time the Beatles arrived in the US, the Beach Boys (along with [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]]) had already established themselves as major chart successes.{{sfn|Davis|1981|p=75}} The Beach Boys and the Four Seasons were also the only two American groups to enjoy major chart success before, during, and after the British Invasion.{{sfn|Tuyl|2004|p=163}} For Wilson, the Beatles ultimately "eclipsed a lot [of what] we’d worked for ... [they] eclipsed the whole music world."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=70}} }}  The Beatles and the Beach Boys inspired each other with their artistry and recording techniques, pushing them further out in the studio.{{sfn|Cook|Pople|2004|p=441}}{{sfn|Miles|1998|p=280}} According to Sanchez, in 1965, "Dylan was rewriting the rules for pop success" with his music and image, and it was at this juncture that Wilson "led The Beach Boys into a transitional phase in an effort to win the pop terrain that had been thrown up for grabs."{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=76}} Wilson then produced the 1966 works ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' and "[[Good Vibrations]]". For the annual best-band poll conducted by ''[[NME]]'' between 1963 and 1969, 1966 was the only year that the Beatles did not win, losing to the Beach Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rodriguez|2012|pp=184–185|loc=1966 NME polls}}; {{harvnb|Sanchez|2014|p=4|loc="On the heels of ''Pet Sounds'' and 'Good Vibrations,' talk of the next big pop acquisition became like open secret.

[[File:1964-Lennon-McCartney (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|[[Lennon–McCartney|Paul McCartney and John Lennon]], the principal songwriters of the Beatles]]
Writing for [[AllMusic]], music critic [[Richie Unterberger]] recognises the Beatles as both "the greatest and most influential act of the rock era" and a group that "introduced more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century".&lt;ref name="AMUnter"/&gt;  In ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's ''Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll'' (2001), the editors define the band's influence as follows:

{{quote|The impact of the Beatles – not only on rock &amp; roll but on all of Western culture – is simply incalculable … [A]s personalities, they defined and incarnated '60s style: smart, idealistic, playful, irreverent, eclectic. Although many of their sales and attendance records have since been surpassed, no group has so radically transformed the sound and significance of rock &amp; roll. ... [they] proved that rock &amp; roll could embrace a limitless variety of harmonies, structures, and sounds; virtually every rock experiment has some precedent on Beatles record.{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=56}}}}

The [[Lennon–McCartney]] songwriting partnership, along with the partnership between Rolling Stones' [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Keith Richards]], as well as other British Invasion songwriters, inspired changes to the music industry because they were bands that wrote and performed their own music. This trend threatened the professional songwriters that dominated the American music industry. [[Ellie Greenwich]], a [[Brill Building]] songwriter, said, “When the Beatles and the entire British Invasion came in, we were all ready to say, ‘Look, it’s been nice, there’s no more room for us… It’s now the self-contained group- males, certain type of material. What do we do?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Beatles, Popular Music and Society|last=Inglis|first=Ian|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2000|isbn=0-312-22236-X|location=New York|pages=53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' editors elaborated: "One of the first rock groups to write most of its own material, they inaugurated the era of self-contained bands and forever centralized pop ... Their music, from the not-so-simple love songs they started with to their later perfectionist studio extravaganzas, set new standards for both commercial and artistic success in pop."{{sfn|George-Warren|2001|p=56}}

In response to the Beatles' 1964 breakthrough, music writers started including pop and rock music in serious discussion.{{sfn|Jones|2002|p=45}}{{refn|group=nb|During the mid 1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners.

The Beatles reinvented and expanded the terms of commercial and artistic achievement, treading new ground for their willingness to experiment and take risks.&lt;!--- Sanchez: "they didn’t just reshuffle the terms of commercial and creative achievement, but that they also radically expanded them, opening up fresh pathways for experimentation and risk."---&gt;{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=73}} One criticism of the group's work is that none of it was truly unprecedented. Author [[Bill Martin (philosophy)|Bill Martin]] objects to this notion: "There has always been experimentation in rock music ... Rock music is synthesis and transmutation ... [but] what was original about the Beatles is that they synthesized and transmuted more or less ''everything'', they did this in a way that reflected their time, they reflected their time in a way that spoke to a great part of humanity, and they did all of this really, really well."{{sfn|Martin|2015|pp=3, 13–14}} Unterberger adds: "they were among the few artists of any discipline that were simultaneously the best at what they did and the most popular at what they did. Relentlessly imaginative and experimental, the Beatles grabbed hold of the international mass consciousness in 1964 and never let go for the next six years, always staying ahead of the pack in terms of creativity but never losing their ability to communicate their increasingly sophisticated ideas to a mass audience. Their supremacy as rock icons remains unchallenged to this day, decades after their breakup in 1970."&lt;ref name="AMUnter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-beatles-mn0000754032/biography |title=The Beatles|first=Richie|last=Unterberger|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genres and stylistic trends===
====Growth of rock bands====
{{See also|Garage rock}}
[[File:The Beatles i Hötorgscity 1963.jpg|thumb|right|Photographed in Sweden, 1963]]

The Beatles' impact on the US was particularly strong, where a [[garage rock]] phenomenon had already begun, with hits such as "[[Louie Louie]]" by [[the Kingsmen]]. The movement received a major lift following the group's historic appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' watched by a record-breaking viewing audience of a nation mourning the recent death of [[President John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Lemlich|1992|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="Kauppila (Garage in San Jose Case Study)"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kauppila|first1=Paul|title=The Sound of the Suburbs: A Case Study of Three Garage Bands in San Jose, California during the 1960s|journal=Popular Music and Society|date=October 2006|pages=7–8, 10–11|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1054&amp;context=lib_pub|via=San Jose State University Faculty Publications |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Spitz|2013|pp=5, 39, 42–49}} Bill Dean writes: "It's impossible to say just how many of America's young people began playing guitars and forming bands in the wake of The Beatles' appearance on the Sullivan show. But the anecdotal evidence suggests thousands&amp;nbsp;– if not hundreds of thousands or even more&amp;nbsp;– young musicians across the country formed bands and proceeded to play."&lt;ref name="Dean (Beatles Infl.)"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dean|first1=Bill|title=50 Years Ago Today, The Beatles Taught a Young America to Play |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20140209/ent/140209672|website=Scene|publisher=Gainesville.com|accessdate=10 October 2015|date=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Petty]], who played in two garage bands in Gainesville, Florida during the 1960s, is quoted mentioning the Beatles' appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and how it influenced him to be in a band.  According to him: "Within weeks of that, you could drive through literally any neighborhood in Gainesville and you would hear the strains of garage bands playing&amp;nbsp;... I mean everywhere. And I'd say by a year from that time, Gainesville probably had 50 bands."&lt;ref name="Dean (Beatles Infl.)"/&gt; For many, particularly young [[baby boomers]], the Beatles' visit reignited the sense of excitement and possibility that had been momentarily taken by Kennedy's assassination.{{sfn|Lemlich|1992|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="Dean (Beatles Infl.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore (60s rock upheaval)"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Gilmore |first1=Mikal|editor1-last=Wenner|editor1-first=Jann|title=Bob Dylan, the Beatles, and the Rock of the Sixties|magazine=Rolling Stone |date=23 August 1990|issue=585|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bob-dylan-the-beatles-and-the-rock-roll-of-the-60s-19900823?page=7|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Spitz|2013|pp=5–6}} Much of this new excitement would be expressed in music, sometimes much to the chagrin of parents and elders, as kids raced to start bands by thousands, and this proliferation of new groups was not limited to the United States.{{sfn|Lemlich|1992|pp=2–3}}&lt;ref name="Dean (Beatles Infl.)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilmore (60s rock upheaval)"/&gt;{{sfn|Spitz|2013|pp=55–59}}

While the Beatles are often credited for sparking a musical revolution, research conducted by the Queen Mary University of London and Imperial College London suggests that the changes sparked by the band were already developing long before they entered the US. The study, which looks at shifts in [[chord progression]]s, beats, lyrics and vocals, shows that American music in the beginning of the 1960s was already moving away from mellow sounds like [[doo-wop]] and into more energetic rock styles. Professor Armand Lero argues that the Beatles' innovations have been overstated by music historians: "They didn’t make a revolution or spark a revolution, they joined one. The trend is already emerging and they rode that wave, which accounts for their incredible success."&lt;ref name="Telegraph2015"/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Before the Beatles reached America, bands like the Beach Boys and the Top Notes were already in [[record chart]]s with "[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]" (1963) and "[[Twist and Shout]]" (1961), respectively. McCartney is quoted before the Beatles left for the United States in 1964: "They've got their own groups. What are we going to give them that they don't already have?"&lt;ref name="Telegraph2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knapton|first1=Sarah|title=The Beatles 'did not spark a musical revolution in America'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/11584335/The-Beatles-did-not-spark-a-musical-revolution-in-America.html|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''|date=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Beatles biographer [[Mark Lewisohn]] disagreed with the research by Queen Mary University, saying it "[doesn't] stack up ... Speak to anyone who was a young person in the US when The Beatles arrived and they will tell you how much of a revolution it was. They were there and they will tell you that the Beatles revolutionised everything."&lt;ref name="Telegraph2015"/&gt;

====Jangle pop and folk rock====

[[File:1967 Rickenbacker 360-12 12 string electric guitar owned and photographed by Greg Field.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Rickenbacker 360/12]] similar to the 12-string guitar used by Harrison]]

[[George Harrison]] was one of the first people to own a [[Rickenbacker 360/12]], a guitar with twelve strings, the low eight of which are tuned in pairs, one octave apart; the higher four are pairs tuned in unison. The Rickenbacker is unique among twelve-string guitars in having the lower octave string of each of the first four pairs placed above the higher tuned string. This, and the naturally rich harmonics produced by a twelve-string guitar provided the distinctive overtones found on many of the Beatles' recordings.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=134–135}}

His use of this guitar during the recording of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' (1964) helped to popularise the model, and the jangly sound became so prominent that ''[[Melody Maker]]'' termed it the Beatles' "secret weapon".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|2002|p=120}}: "secret weapon"; {{harvnb|Leng|2006|p=14}}: Harrison helped to popularize the model.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger McGuinn]] liked the effect so much that it became his signature guitar sound with the Byrds.{{sfn|Doggett|Hodgson|2004|p=82}}  While [[the Everly Brothers]] and [[The Searchers (band)|the Searchers]] laid the foundations for [[jangle pop]] in the late 1950s to mid 1960s, the Beatles and the Byrds are commonly credited with launching the popularity of the "jangly" sound that defined the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/lists/2009/12/jangle-bell-rock-a-chronological-non-holiday-antho.html |title=Jangle Bell Rock: A Chronological (Non-Holiday) Anthology… from The Beatles and Byrds to R.E.M. and Beyond |last=LaBate |first=Steve |publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=December 18, 2009 |accessdate=July 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Byrds and Dylan, the Beatles were a huge influence on the [[folk rock]] explosion that would follow in the next year.&lt;ref name="AMUnter" /&gt;

====British pop and power pop====
{{Main|Power pop}}
With the rise of the Beatles in 1963, the terms Mersey sound and [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] were applied to bands and singers from Liverpool, and this was the first time in British pop music that a sound and a location were linked together.{{sfn|Inglis|2010|p=11}} The origins of [[power pop]] date back to the early to mid 1960s with what AllMusic calls: "a cross between the crunching [[hard rock]] of [[the Who]] and the sweet melodicism of the Beatles and the Beach Boys, with the ringing guitars of the Byrds thrown in for good measure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/power-pop-ma0000002793 |title=Power Pop |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Beatles magical mystery tour.jpg|thumb|left|Pictured in 1967 for the "[[I Am the Walrus]]" sequence in their ''[[Magical Mystery Tour (film)|Magical Mystery Tour]]'' film]]

[[Progressive rock]] (or [[art rock]]) grew out of the classically-minded strains of British psychedelia.&lt;ref name="prog-rockAM"/&gt;  In 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of [[cultivated music]] with the [[Folk music|vernacular traditions]] of rock.{{sfn|Holm-Hudson|2013|p=85}} According to Everett, the Beatles' "experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts" on their albums ''Rubber Soul'' and ''Revolver'' "encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s".{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=95}}  Academics [[Paul Hegarty]] and Martin Halliwell identify the Beatles "not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days".{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}}{{refn|group=nb|This is in addition to the Beach Boys, [[the Doors]], [[the Pretty Things]], [[the Zombies]], the Byrds, [[the Grateful Dead]] and [[Pink Floyd]].{{sfn|Hegarty|Halliwell|2011|p=11}}}}  After the release of ''Rubber Soul'', many "[[baroque rock|baroque-rock]]" works would soon appear, particularly due to its track "[[In My Life]]".{{sfn|Harrington|2002|p=191}}{{refn|group=nb|''[[Slate magazine|Slate]]''{{'}}s Forrest Wickman credits Brian Wilson and the Beatles' producer, [[George Martin]], as some of the men "most responsible" for the move into baroque pop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wickman|first1=Forrest|title=George Martin, the Beatles Producer and "Fifth Beatle," Is Dead at 90|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/03/09/george_martin_beatles_producer_and_fifth_beatle_is_dead_at_90.html|publisher=[[Slate magazine|Slate]]|date=March 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles benefited from the classical music skills of Martin, who played a baroque harpsichord solo on "In My Life".{{sfn|Harrington|2002|p=191}} However, the instrument used was actually a piano recorded on tape at half speed.&lt;ref name="WSJBach2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Marc|title=Bach &amp; Roll: How the Unsexy Harpsichord Got Hip|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304200804579163670969242120|journal=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Citing a quantitative study of [[tempo]]s in music from the era, musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] identifies ''Rubber Soul'' as a work that was "made more to be thought about than danced to", and an album that "began a far-reaching trend" in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music.{{sfn|Everett|2001|pp=311–12}} Although [[the Kinks]], [[the Yardbirds]] and the Beatles themselves (with "[[Ticket To Ride]]") had incorporated droning guitars to mimic the qualities of the [[sitar]], ''Rubber Soul''{{'}}s "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)]]" is generally credited as sparking a musical craze for the sound of the instrument in the mid-1960s — a trend which would later be associated with the growth of [[raga rock]], [[Indian rock]], and the essence of [[psychedelic rock]].{{sfn|Bellman|1998|p=292}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title=[[Rubber Soul]]| others=[[The Beatles]]| year=2009| last=Howlett| first=Kevin| type=CD booklet| publisher=[[Parlophone Records]]| id=| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=April 2016}} In terms of bridging the relationship between music and hallucinogens, the Beatles and the Beach Boys were the most pivotal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longman|first1=Molly|title=Had LSD Never Been Discovered Over 75 Years Ago, Music History Would Be Entirely Different|url=https://mic.com/articles/143256/had-lsd-never-been-discovered-over-75-years-ago-music-history-would-be-entirely-different#.1lXG1R2k1|website=Music.mic|date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolver'' ensured that [[psychedelic pop]] emerged from its underground roots and into the mainstream.&lt;ref name="AMPop"&gt;{{cite web|author=Anon|title=Psychedelic Pop|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/psychedelic-pop-ma0000011915|website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Carys Wyn Jones locates ''Sgt. Pepper's'', along with ''Pet Sounds'', to the beginning of art rock.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=49}} Both albums are largely viewed as beginnings in the progressive rock genre due to their lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism and influences derived from classical music forms.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=15,20}} For several years following ''Sgt. Pepper''{{'s}} release, straightforward rock and roll was supplanted by a growing interest in [[Cyclic form|extended form]].{{sfn|Moore|1997|p=72}}  Several of the English psychedelic bands who followed in the wake of the Beatles' ''Sgt. Pepper's'' developed characteristics of the Beatles' music (specifically their classical influence) further than either the Beatles or contemporaneous West Coast psychedelic bands.{{sfn|Macan|1997|p=21}} AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by ''Sgt. Pepper's'' and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of [[European music|European]] and classical music to the genre.&lt;ref name="prog-rockAM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/prog-rock-ma0000002798|website=[[AllMusic]]|title=Prog-Rock}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beatles were the first entertainment act to stage a large stadium concert.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} At [[Shea Stadium]] in
New York City on Sunday, 15 August 1965, the group opened their [[The Beatles' 1965 USA Tour|1965 North American tour]] to a record audience of 55,600.

[[File:The Fabs.JPG|thumb|The mop-topped Beatles in 1964.]]

The '''Beatle haircut''', also known as the "'''[[mod haircut|mop-top]]'''" (or '''moptop'''), because of its resemblance to a mop, or "'''Arthur'''" among fans,{{refn|group=nb|At a press conference at the [[Plaza Hotel]] in New York, shortly after the Beatles' arrival in the United States, Harrison was asked by a reporter, "What do you call your hairstyle?"

[[Beatle boot]]s are tight-fitting, [[High-heeled footwear#Men and heels|Cuban-heeled]], ankle-length boots with a pointed toe. They originated in 1963 when [[Brian Epstein]] discovered Chelsea boots while browsing in the London footwear company Anello &amp; Davide.

[[Image:Pitsection.jpg|thumb|Fig 1. Saxon pit half sectioned]]
In [[archaeology]] and [[stratification (archaeology)|archaeological stratification]] a '''cut''' or '''truncation''' is a [[Archaeological context|context]] that represents a moment in time when other archaeological deposits were removed for the creation of some [[Feature (archaeology)|feature]] such as a ditch or pit.  In layman's terms, a cut can be thought of a hole that was dug in the past, though cut also applies to other parts of the [[archaeological record]] such as horizontal truncations like terraced ground.  A cut context is sometimes referred to as a "negative context" as opposed to a "positive context". The term denotes that a cut has removed material from the archaeological record or [[archaeological natural|natural]] at the time of its creation as opposed to a positive context which adds material to the archaeological record. A cut has zero thickness and no material properties of its own and is defined by the limits of other contexts. Cuts are seen in the record by virtue of the difference between the material it was cut through and the material that back fills it. This difference is seen as an "edge" by the archaeologists on site. This is shown in the picture above (Fig 1.), where a [[archaeological section|half sectioned]] Saxon pit has had half its [[Fill (archaeology)|backfill]] removed and we can clearly see a difference between the ground the pit was cut into and the material originally filling the pit. Sometimes these differences are not clear and an archaeologist must rely on experience and insight to discover cuts.

==Re-cuts==
[[Image:Maggie and horse.PNG|thumb|Photographer takes a record shot of a horse burial in a Roman ditch re-cut]]
Re-cuts are cuts made within the confines or near confines of other cuts, often to regain the function of the original cut or harvest material from the original fill. Re-cuts are considered quite valuable as a source of information because they can shed insight on function and attitude over time. An example of re-cutting would be a roadside ditch being re-cut and emptied of silt and detritus as a form of maintenance. Conversely, a roadside ditch that is never re-cut gives a certain impression about the attitude towards the investment in infrastructure the road represents. Re-cuts by their nature are hard to discern because the re-cut can truncate the original cut in part and be completely in the confines of the original [[Quan Test|fill]] in other parts. They can even be absent from the record. Cutting is the reason why not all past activity on a site leaves traces of its existence in the [[sequence (archaeological)|sequence]].
[[Image:Recutditch.png|thumb|Fig 2]]

===Hypothetical ditch re-cuts shown in section===
Fig 2 shows how a ditch cut with at least two re-cuts may appear when viewed [[Archaeological section|in section]]. It is possible that numerous other re-cuts took place and were truncated out of the [[archaeological record]] by one or more of the re-cuts that has survived.

'''Eqrem Çabej''' ({{IPA-sq|ˌɛcrɛm ˈt͡ʃabɛj}}) (6 August 1908 – 13 August 1980) was an [[Albania]]n historical linguist and scholar who, through the publication of numerous studies gained a reputation as a key expert in the research into [[Albanian-language]], literature, [[ethnology]] and [[linguistics]].

==Educational background==
He was born in [[Eskişehir]], [[Turkey]] and completed his elementary education in [[Gjirokastër]], southern [[Albania]], in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elsie|first1=Robert|title=Historical dictionary of Albania|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=9780810873803|page=67|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=haFlGXIg8uoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=Eqrem+Cabej+1908+eski%C5%9Fehir&amp;hl=el&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAWoVChMIj4C20fTWxwIVxcUUCh2E1gDH#v=onepage&amp;q=Eqrem%20Cabej%201908%20eski%C5%9Fehir&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then left Albania, at the age of 12, and moved to [[Austria]] to continue his studies: first in St. Pölten then  in [[Klagenfurt]] (1923–26), where he obtained his bachelor's degree. He went to University first in [[Graz]] (1927) and later in [[Vienna]] (1930–33). Attending lectures of renowned language scholars such as [[Paul Kretschmer]], Karl Patsch, [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]], and [[Norbert Jokl]], Çabej developed, under Jokl's guidance, an intense interest in the historical development of [[Albanian language]]. Before returning to Albania at the end of 1933, he submitted, in the University of Vienna, the ''Italoalbanische Studien'' (''Italo-Albanian Studies'' in English) as his doctoral dissertation.

==Career as an educator and scholar==
Home after a 13-year absence, the 25-year-old Çabej returned to Albania and spent five years as a secondary school teacher in: [[Shkodra]], [[Elbasan]], Gjirokastër and [[Tirana]]. After Albania's occupation by [[Italian Fascism|Mussolini's Italy]] on 7 April 1939, he was sent away from Albania and confined to Rome, Italy. In 1942, he received an invitation to join the newly formed Institute of Albanian Studies, which he declined, and, in 1943, was offered the position of minister of education in the government headed by Prime Minister [[Rexhep Mitrovica]] which he refused also. Returning to Albania in the spring of 1944, he continued to work as a teacher and, in 1947, was appointed as a researcher in Instituti i Shkencavet (The Institute of Sciences) in Tirana, the precursor institution of the [[University of Tirana]]. From 1952 to 1967, he served as a professor of the history of [[Albanian language]] and historical [[phonology]]. In 1972, he became a founding member of [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]]. He worked as a researcher at the Institute of Linguistics and Literature in Tirana until the end of his life.

Eqrem Çabej died in a clinic in Rome, Italy, a week after his 72nd birthday.

'''Erik Gustaf Geijer''' (12 January 1783 – 23 April 1847) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] writer, [[history|historian]], poet, philosopher, and [[composer]]. His writings served to promote Swedish  [[National Romanticism]].  He also was an influential advocate of [[Liberalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/svlihist/geijereg.html ''Erik Gustaf Geijer'  (Svensk litteraturhistoria i sammandrag)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Geijer was born at Geijersgården, his family's estate in [[Ransäter]], [[Värmland]]. He was educated at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of [[Karlstad]], and then attended the [[University of Uppsala]], where he earned his master's degree in 1806. In 1803 he had competed successfully for an historical prize offered by the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences at Stockholm]].  In 1809, he traveled in [[England]]. The year following, he became a lecturer in history at Uppsala, and in 1815 assistant to Eric Michael Fant.  Succeeding Fant, Geijer was a professor of history from 1817 at Uppsala University where a statue now commemorates him.  He was rector of Uppsala University during the years 1822, 1830, 1836 and 1843-1844. As a representative of the university, he was a member of the [[Church of Sweden]] clergy: 1828-30 and 1840-41. He was a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] (on seat 14) from 1824.  In 1835, he became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nordicacademicpress.com/o.o.i.s?id=43&amp;vid=626&amp;template=.print.t ''Geijer – lysande lärd, ständig sökare''  (Edvard Matz. Populär Historia)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714192848/http://www.nordicacademicpress.com/o.o.i.s?id=43&amp;vid=626&amp;template=.print.t |date=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Geijer, Erik Gustaf|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geijer was also a founding member of the [[Geatish Society]] ({{lang-sv|Götiska förbundet}}). In the first issue of its periodical, ''Iduna,'' appeared Geijer's most famous poem ''The Viking'' ({{lang-sv|Vikingen}}), which described the [[Viking]] as the heroic [[Norsemen|Norseman]] that many of us might imagine today and was a turning-point in the rehabilitation of [[Norsemen|Norse]] culture among the Swedish people. Geijer also collaborated with [[Arvid August Afzelius]], in the three volume collection of Swedish folk-songs, ''Svenska folk-visor från forntiden''  (Stockholm, 1814–1816).&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/folksang/  ''Svenska folk-visor från forntiden'' (Project Runeberg)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geijer was also a noted historian, although he did not complete any one of the vast undertakings which he planned. Of the ''Records of Sweden'' ({{lang-sv|Svea Rikes häfder}}), which were to have embraced the history of his native country from mythical ages to his own times, he finished only the introductory volume. His ''Svenska folkets historia'' (3 vols., 1832–36), which was intended to form one of the series of European histories edited by Leo and Ukert, was not carried beyond the abdication of [[Queen Christina of Sweden|Queen Christina]] (1654), the reason probably being the author's conversion to liberalism in history and politics. It has been suggested, however, that Geijer’s declaring for liberalism was perhaps as much coming-out-of-the-closet as it was a true conversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasselgren|first1=Björn|last2=Klein|first2=Daniel|title=The Warm Liberalism of Erik Gustaf Geijer|url=https://www.liberalcurrents.com/the-warm-liberalism-of-erik-gustaf-geijer/|website=Liberal Currents|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incomplete as they are, these works are highly regarded contributions to Swedish history. His ''History of the Swedes down to Charles X'' was translated into English by Turner, with biographical introduction (London, 1845).&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

Geijer was entrusted the task of examining and editing the papers which [[Gustaf III of Sweden|Gustavus III]] had bequeathed to the University of Uppsala, with the stipulation that they were not to be opened for fifty years after his death. In fulfillment of his charge, Geijer arranged these papers in a work which appeared in 1843-45 under the title of ''Gusstaf III's efterlemnade papper'', but they contained little or nothing of value.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

Although he rose to fame as a nationalist author, Geijer's views changed during his lifetime. During the last ten years of his life, he took an active part in politics, and began to advocate social reform and Liberalism.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://litteraturbanken.se/#!forfattare/GeijerEG ''Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783–1847)'' (Litteraturbanken)]&lt;/ref&gt; Although his political writings possess great merit, the very versatility of his powers diverted him from applying them methodically to the complete elaboration of any one subject.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

In 1846 increasing ill health forced him to resign his position as professor at Uppsala. He died in Stockholm. He left some personal memoirs, ''Minnen'' (Upsala, 1834). His collected works, ''Samlade Skrifter'', with a bibliographic treatise by Teodblad (8 vols.), appeared at Stockholm (1873–75).&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;

==Geijersgården==
[[Geijersgården]] is a historic mansion centrally located in Uppsala, north of the Uppsala University library. Geijersgården is named after Erik Gustaf Geijer, who lived there from 1837 to 1846.   The main building was built between 1737-38.  The estate gained its present appearance around 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geijersamfundet.se/erik-gustaf-geijer.html ''Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783−1847)'' (geijersamfundet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the estate was taken over by Uppsala University and since 1965 has housed the Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation (''Hammarskjöldfonden''). The building was restored in the 1983 after a fire in which the building's western parts were badly damaged.  The buildings are classified as historic properties under the Swedish Cultural Monuments Act (''Kulturminneslagen'').

was an Anglo-Australian historian.

Labilliere was born in [[Melbourne]], Victoria, Australia, the son of [[Huguenot]]-descended Charles Edgar de Labilliere and his wife Hannah, ''née'' Balle (died 1880).&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;  Charles and Hannah de Labilliere travelled in the ''Westminster'', the second ship which sailed from England direct for the [[Port Phillip District]], and landed in Melbourne in December 1839.&lt;ref name=Mennell&gt;{{cite Australasia|de Labilliere, Francis Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles de Labilliere engaged in pastoral pursuits at Tallook Yale, near [[Bacchus Marsh]], and later died in London on 2 November 1870.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

Francis Labilliere, went to England with his father in 1859; entered at the [[Middle Temple]] on 7 November 1860; called to the bar on 6 June  1863; married at St. Saviour's, Paddington, on 9 October 1867, Adelaide, eldest daughter of the late Rev. Edward Ravenshaw, rector of West Rington, Wiltshire.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Labilliere always took a deep interest in the relations of the mother country and the colonies, and was one of the very earliest advocates of Imperial Federation, developing his views on the question in a succession of papers, the first at the Social Science Congress at Bristol, in 1869, on "The Future Relations of England and her Colonies"; the second at the Colonial Conference, Westminster Palace Hotel, in 1871, of which he was honorary secretary, on "Imperial and Colonial Federalism"; the two next before the [[Royal Colonial Institute]], in 1875 on "The Permanent Unity of the Empire"; and in 1881 on "The Political Organisation of the Empire".&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; Labilliere again opened the question before the Social Science Congress at Birmingham, in 1884, and before the conference arranged by the Royal Colonial Institute at the Colonial Exhibition of 1886. He also combated the views of Goldwin Smith and other advocates of disintegration, in an article on "The Contraction of England, and its Advocates," in the National Review, in 1884. In that year also, on his suggestion, the first steps were taken to found the [[Imperial Federation League]], he being honorary secretary to the provisional committee, and afterwards, jointly with Mr. Arnold Forster, to the League, on its establishment.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; From 1874 to 1881, as a member of the council of the Royal Colonial Institute, he assisted [[Sir Frederick Young]] in the honorary secretarial work of the society before it was in a position to maintain a paid staff. As appears by the correspondence laid before Parliament in 1876, he was the first to suggest the annexation of Eastern [[New Guinea]], in a long letter addressed in 1874 to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, a copy of which was sent, with a covering despatch, by [[Henry Herbert, 4th Earl of Carnarvon]] to each of the governors of the Australian colonies.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt;

In 1878 Labilliere's "Early History of the Colony of Victoria" appeared, in two volumes. It corrected the previously received date of the discovery of [[Port Phillip Bay]], and brought to light many facts and documents which had been forgotten, or never before made public.&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; de Labilliere resided at [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]] in his latter years&lt;ref name=Mennell/&gt; and died there on 19 February 1895.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

'''Gérard Anthony Besson''', H.B.M., DLitt. h.c., is a [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] writer and publisher.

== Life ==
Gérard was born on January 20, 1942 in [[Port of Spain]] as the only child of Joseph and Margaret Besson. His father was a white plantation overseer, his coloured mother worked in the oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://caribbean-beat.com/issue-136/gerard-besson-own-words#axzz4Ni5Zrlvs | title=Gerard Besson: "I’m such a set of loose ends" | publisher=Caribbean Beat #136, November 2015 | accessdate=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the early separation of his parents, he grew up in the Catholic, [[Antillean Creole French|Patois]]-speaking household of his maternal grandmother. After elementary school, he attended St. Thomas High School in [[Port of Spain#Belmont|Belmont]] until the age of 15 when he started working in insurance and in manufacturing companies. After he received an inheritance on the death of his grandmother he travelled to Europe and Great Britain where he unavailingly tried to gain ground as a painter and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://legacy.guardian.co.tt/archives/2007-07-05/bussguardian6.html | title=Gerard Besson: T&amp;T’s historiographer | publisher=Trinidad Guardian, July 5, 2007 | accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his return to Trinidad, he worked as a copywriter for various advertising agencies. In the late 1960s, he attracted attention by using black models to advertise high-priced products, a novelty in Trinidad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/20150714/features/history-page-by-page | title=History, page by page | publisher=Trinidad Express, July 14, 2015 | accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he founded his own advertising agency together with [[Clive Bradley (musician)|Clive Bradley]]. In the same year, he married Sheelagh Hezekiah with whom he has three sons. From 1979 until 1985, he served for seven years on the St. Augustine Campus Council of the [[University of the West Indies]] (UWI). At the beginning of the 1980s, Besson was a member of a circle of writers and historians around Olga Mavrogordato, widow of Colonel [[Arthur Stephen Mavrogordato]]. This group, of which [[Anthony de Verteuil]] und [[Michael Anthony (author)|Michael Anthony]] were also members, was dedicated to publishing works about the history and cultural traditions of Trinidad and Tobago. In 1981, Besson founded the publishing company Paria Publishing, initially focussed on republishing of out-of-print works on the history of Trinidad and Tobago. In the following 35 years, he produced and published more than 130 books, many of which non-fiction books by Trinidadian historians. From 1982 to 1985, Besson was a director of the [[National Museum and Art Gallery, Trinidad|National Museum and Art Gallery]] in Port of Spain. In 1995, Besson's advertising agency was acquired by [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi|Lonsdale Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]]; Besson himself remained as creative director. In 1996, he got divorced from his first wife, and, in 1998, he married German-born Alice Schwarz.

Besson retired from Lonsdale Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in 2002 but continued to contribute to the cultural life in Trinidad. In the 2000s, he curated exhibitions in several museums such as in the Museum at the House of Angostura (2001–2003), in the Heritage Library (2004) and in the National Museum and Art Gallery (2007). In 2005, he was appointed to the board of the National Trust and served on the advisory council for the setting up of an Academy of Arts, Letters, Culture and Public Affairs of the [[University of Trinidad and Tobago]]. In 2011, he was appointed to serve on the Equal Opportunities Commission by Trinidadian president [[George Maxwell Richards]] and continued to work for the commission until 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/news/Swearing-in_for_final_2-121756104.html | title=Swearing-in for final 2 | publisher=Trinidad Express, May 12, 2011 | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besson is a member of the Association of Caribbean Historians.

== Works ==
Besson's works as a historian cover various aspects of Trinidadian and Tobagonian history and culture which can partly be traced back to research assignments from various companies and institutions. A core element of his fictional work is the history of the Afro-French-Creole presence in Trinidad and Tobago and the wider Caribbean, the ethnic group from which his family originates. This topic is being dealt with in his novels ''The Voice in the Govi'' and ''From the Gates of Aksum''. The storylines of his novels are fictitious, but the backgrounds are historical, especially in ''Roume de St. Laurent … A Memoir''. This novel depicts the life of [[Philippe Rose Roume de Saint-Laurent]], a French adventurer who had a significant influence on the development of Spanish Trinidad in the late 18th century. Roume was instrumental in the promulgation of the ''cedula de populacion'' of 1783 in the Caribbean, an edict of Spanish minister [[José de Gálvez|José de Gálvez y Gallardo]] that allowed for the settlement of Catholics in Trinidad. This edict created a remarkable increase in the population of the island, mostly French-speaking colonists.

In 2000 and 2001, Besson wrote and produced ''The Land of Beginnings'', a monthly supplement to Trinidadian newspaper Newsday that dealt with historical topics and appeared for 24 months. Trinidadian TV channel TTT financed the production of ''The Land of Beginnings'' as a threepart documentary. His 2010 non-fiction book ''The Cult of Will'' was the subject of controversy, as it sought to deconstruct the narrative of former Trinidad and Tobago prime minister [[Eric Williams]] with regard to the emancipation of the slaves in the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.trinidadexpress.com/article/20100703/ARTICLE/307039863 | title=Eric Williams revisited | publisher=Trinidad Express, July 3, 2010 | accessdate=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besson maintains the ''Caribbean History Archives'', a private weblog where he collects new findings on Trinidadian history.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2177">'''Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya''' ([[Arabic]]: هجر امذيبية) is an ancient settlement that date back to the kingdom of Hadramawt in [[Nisab District|Nisab]] district of [[Shabwah Governorate]] in [[Yemen]]. The site [[necropolis]] (100 m large) revealed elaborate and extraordinary burial objects. Though the findings was concentrated in a small portion of the general area. Four burials only were excavated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The site==
[[File:Shabwa2.jpg||thumb|250px| Silver ladle found in one of the burials]]
The city sequence is divided into 5 phases based on major changes of the site architecture. The initial phase on the hill top is usually dated to first centuries AD and was dominated by a single building constructed using characteristic technique of pre-Islamic south Arabia. Only one room in the structure with preserved floor exist. It appears, from the fill beneath the plaster floor, that at one point, the building was renewed. Glacis (4–6 m wide) was also constructed on the site, however whether it encircle the entire tell is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;Two seasons at Hajar Am-Dhaybiyya, Yemen, Arabian Archaeology and Epigraphy (AEE):  P.93&lt;/ref&gt;

Judging from the surface layers of the necropolis, the tombs appear to span over several centuries. Grave 3 is dated approximately between 1st to 4th century AD. And the artifacts found there shows detectable Roman artistic influence.

Four burials had been excavated in the site necropolis, only grave 3 was intact, and it yielded great amount of funerary possessions. Which apparently belonged to either an upper class individual, or rather a soldier as suggested by the presence of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dasi.humnet.unipi.it/index.php?id=dasi_prj_sit&amp;prjId=1&amp;corId=0&amp;colId=0&amp;navId=36512484&amp;recId=279/ DASI: Hajar am-Dhaybiyya]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heinrich von Fichtenau''' (December 10, 1912 &amp;ndash; June 15, 2000) was an [[Austria]]n [[medievalism|medievalist]] best known for his studies of medieval [[diplomatics]], social, and intellectual history. He spent his academic career at the [[University of Vienna]] and from 1962 to 1983 served as director of the [[Institut für österreichische Geschichtsforschung]] (Institute for Austrian Historical Research). Many of Fichtenau's books were translated into English and he remains one of the few Austrian medievalists of the postwar period whose work has enjoyed a broad and influential reception in Anglophone scholarship.

Born in [[Linz]] to a prosperous family, Fichtenau entered the University of Vienna in 1931 and completed the archivists' training course at the Institut für österreichische Geschichtsforschung in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stoy|first1=Manfred|title=Das Institut für oesterreichische Geschichtsforschung, 1929-1945|date=2007|publisher=Oldenbourg}} pp. 336ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently continued on for his doctoral degree, awarded in 1940, under the Institute's director [[Hans Hirsch]], and wrote his [[Habilitation]] thesis while serving on the Eastern Front in the German [[Wehrmacht]] during [[World War II]]. Published in 1946 as ''Mensch und Schrift im Mittelalter'' (''Man and Writing in the Middle Ages''), this Habilitation established Fichtenau's reputation as an authority on the social and cultural contexts of literacy and documentary practice in the Middle Ages. In 1949, Fichtenau published a short treatment of the [[Carolingian Empire]] which drew sharp criticism from German academics, but found more favorable reception in the U.S. and Great Britain (''The Carolingian Empire: The Age of Charlemagne'', abridged trans. Peter Munz, 1957). Fichtenau attempted to demythologize [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne's]] achievements and draw out many of the contradictions and fundamental instabilities within the empire he created. Written in post-war Vienna, the book was a frank, if understandably cynical, take on historical narratives of the early Middle Ages which celebrated power, conquest, and the idealized image of a pan-European polity. Fichtenau was appointed Extraordinary (Associate) Professor of History at Vienna in 1950, and received a promotion to a full professorial chair (Ordinarius) in 1963, at which time he also assumed the director's position at the Institute. 

==Scholarship and Influence==
Fichtenau taught primarily in the field of ancillary historical sciences (Historische Hilfswissenschaften), a set of disciplines that encompasses the technical study of medieval historical sources, such as [[paleography]], [[diplomatics]], [[epigraphy]], [[sigilography]], and [[heraldry]]. Much of his published work in German relates to understanding how the forms of documentation and writing in the Middle Ages reflect social and cultural change. Between 1950 and 1955 Fichtenau, along with his colleague [[Erich Zöllner]], published the diplomas of the [[House of Babenberg]]. In a series of studies entitled ''Arenga: Spätantike und Mittelalter im Spiegel von Urkundenformeln'' (Cologne &amp; Vienna, 1957), Fichtenau traced shifts in the self-representation of medieval rulers in the rhetoric of the introductory clauses of their diplomas. In 1971, he published ''Das Urkundenwesen in Österreich vom 8. bis zum frühen 13. Jahrhundert'' (Cologne &amp; Vienna), a still unsurpassed analysis of the various forms, and—more importantly—social and cultural significance, of medieval charters from institutions and collections in southern Germany and Austria. 

Fichtenau's landmark monographic study, ''Lebensordnungen des 10. Jahrhunderts'', appeared in 1984 and was later translated into English by the American medievalist [[Patrick J. Geary]] as ''Living in the Tenth Century: Mentalities and Social Orders'' (Chicago &amp; London, 1991). In it, Fichtenau explored the political, religious and social value systems of a period that many (including historians) still characterize as primitive, violent, and mostly unknown—the so-called "Dark Ages." In focusing on perceptions of order, rather than traditional political narratives, Fichtenau's work resonated more with the interdisciplinary Anglo-French approaches to medieval social history than the traditions of legal and institutional history characteristic of much German-language historiography at the time.

==Retirement and Later Work==
In 1983, Fichtenau retired and passed the directorship of the Viennese Institute on to his pupil and protégé, [[Herwig Wolfram]]. In retirement throughout the 80's and 90's, he remained an active scholar. In 1991, he produced a wide-ranging intellectual/religious study of the concomitant emergence of [[heresy|heretical movements]] and [[scholasticism]] in medieval Europe after the eleventh century, translated into English as ''Heretics and Scholars in the High Middle Ages, 1000-1200'' (Philadelphia, 1998). He fell suddenly ill in the spring of 2000 and died several days later at the age of 88. Fichtenau is buried at his family's crypt in the town of [[Baden bei Wien|Baden]], near Vienna.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7366">'''Helen Zeese Papanikolas''' (June 29, 1917 – October 31, 2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=In Memoriam | work=U-News &amp; Views | publisher=[[University of Utah]] | date=December 2004 | url=http://www.alumni.utah.edu/u-news/december04/memoriam.htm#papanikolas | accessdate=2009-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Greek-American ethnic historian, novelist and folklorist who documented the immigrant experience in [[Utah]] and the American West through histories, memoirs, fiction, and poetry.  Her ethnographic themes drew upon her experience as a Greek-American in a small western community.

==Biography==
Helen Zeese was born in the mining community of [[Cameron, Utah|Cameron]] (near [[Castle Gate, Utah|Castle Gate]]) in [[Carbon County, Utah]], to [[Greece|Greek]] immigrant parents George and Emily Zeese (originally Yiorgis and Emilia Zisimopoulos). The family moved to nearby [[Helper, Utah|Helper]] and, in 1933, to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] where they established a chain of grocery stores. In her youth, Zeese attended Helper Central School and Carbon High School while living in Carbon County, and East High School in Salt Lake City.

While attending the [[University of Utah]], Zeese served as editor of the campus literary magazine ''Pen'' and associated with several other students who would become prominent in the field of western history.  These included historian and archivist [[Dale Morgan]].  She graduated with a B.A. from the University in 1939.  She married Nick E. Papanikolas and the couple had two children, Zeese and Thalia.

In 1984, the University of Utah awarded Papanikolas an honorary doctorate.  She and her husband established scholarship programs for minority students at the University of Utah and the [[College of Eastern Utah]].  Papanikolas died in November 2004.

==Career and cultural contributions==
In 1950, Papanikolas was asked to write about Greek communities for the Utah Historical Quarterly.  The subsequent 1954 article ''The Greeks of Carbon County'' broadened the scope of published Utah history, which had previously focused on settlement and progress of the administration and membership of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons).  The article contributed to a fuller understanding of Utah’s cultural and ethnic heritage and served as a lasting example for local ethnic historians.  For fifty years, her works on ethnic history were published in the Utah Historical Quarterly and Western Humanities Review.  She wrote seven books, both fiction and non-fiction.  Publications also include historical monographs and anthologies such as ''Toil and Rage in a New Land: The Greek Immigrants of Utah'' (1970) and ''The Peoples of Utah'' (1976).  Papanikolas' skill as a novelist and storyteller was demonstrated in ''The Time of the Little Black Bird'', which won the Utah Fiction Prize for 2000. 
 
During her research, Papanikolas collected numerous primary documents and conducted extensive interviews with immigrants and historians.  She was  instrumental in organizing and contributing to an ethnic archive at the Oral History Archives, [[Marriott Library]], University of Utah. Selected papers are also held in The Helen Z. Papanikolas Oral Histories Collection, 1969–1974, Utah State Historical Society, in Salt Lake City and in the Immigration History Research Center, College of Liberal Arts, at the [[University of Minnesota]].  Her years of fieldwork and extensive archival work on Greek America led to Papanikolas’ reputation as a leading authority on Greek immigrant life in the United States.  She presented papers at national and international conferences and served as a consultant for television documentaries and other projects.

In 1977, Papanikolas was a founder and first president of ''The Peoples of Utah Institute''.  As president, she located and identified artifacts associated with ethnic life, produced a major museum exhibit, and sponsored lectures and other programs.  Her efforts at the institute led to the establishment of the ''Hellenic Cultural Museum'' in Salt Lake City.  She also served on the Children's Service Society Board (1962–69); Advisory Board of Editors, Utah Historical Quarterly (1969–73); Board of State History (1973–85); and Utah Endowment for the Humanities State Committee (1973–79).

==Awards==
Awards for her contribution to cultural history include:   [http://www.media.utah.edu/UHE/p/PAPANIKOLAS.html]:

* Archbishop of the Americas Iakovos Saint Paul Medal (1972);
* Fellow of the Utah State Historical Society (1975);
* Japanese-American Citizens League Award (1976);
* Brotherhood Award, [[National Conference of Christians and Jews]], Utah Chapter (1978);
* Distinguished Alumna Award, University of Utah (1983); and

'''Iachim Sergheevici Grosul''' (name also rendered as '''Yakim Grosul''') (21 September 1912 – 28 September 1976) was a [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] scientist, and the first president of the Academy of Science of the [[Moldavian SSR]] in the [[Soviet Union]].

== Biography ==

He was born in the village of Cărăgaş, [[Administrative Region of Slobozia|Slobozia county]]. In 1937, he graduated from the Pedagogic Institute in [[Tiraspol]]. After this, he worked at the Institute as lecturer in history. He joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] in 1939. In 1940 he became dean of the History Department. From 1947, he was vice director, and from 1954, he was president of the Moldavian section of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences#History|USSR Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name="Grosul1"&gt;Grosul, Iachim S. (1974) ''Akademija nauk Moldavskoj SSR'' Academy of Sciences of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, Kišinev, [http://worldcat.org/oclc/71567689 OCLC 71567689], in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, he was elected as the first president of the new [[Academy of Sciences of Moldova|Academy of Science of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]].&lt;ref name="Grosul1"/&gt; He was a good organiser, scientist and historian. Grosul developed and edited the ''Enciclopedia Republici Sovietice Socialiste Moldoveneşti'', an eight-volume encyclopedia published between 1964 and 1981. He is noted for his book on the economic development of [[Bessarabia]] under Russian rule in the 19th century. However, his works relating to history, were many times censured, a common practice in the marxist dogmatic Soviet Union.

In 2004, his image and name were used on a silver coin minted by [[Transnistrian Republican Bank|Central Bank of Transnistria]] to honor this native of what today is [[Transnistria]], as part of a series of memorable coins called "[[The Outstanding People of Pridnestrovie]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewellernet.com/info/news/lenta/2004_12_28_17_22_55.html "Silver memorial coins are issued in Pridnestrovye" (28 December 2004) ''Russian Jewellery Network'']&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intentism''' is an [[art movement]] founded by Vittorio Pelosi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vittoriopelosi.webs.com/biography.htm www.vittoriopelosi.webs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intentists have staged various exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1stangel.co.uk/|title=1stAngel Arts – Life in and around the arts today|website=1stangel.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have spoken at Universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.ac.uk/alumni/bulletin09/mar/March%202009.html|title=University of the Arts London Alumni Bulletin|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[University of the Arts London]]. In 2009 their [[manifesto]] was published in ''Intentism - The Resurrection of the author''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ACXBVG|title=www.amazon.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name and origin==
Intentists come from a variety of backgrounds but are all questioning ideas related to the meaning of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intentismcommunity.webs.com/alumniinterview.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Intentism is a response to the debate around [[authorial intent]].&lt;ref name="culturewars.org.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturewars.org.uk/index.php/site/article/intentism_the_resurrection_of_the_author/|title=Culture Wars - Intentism – the Resurrection of the Author|website=www.culturewars.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the public debates that launched intentism, Vittorio Pelosi cited four key schools that the new movement sought to challenge. These include the so-called "[[Authorial intent|The Intentional Fallacy]]" published by [[Monroe Beardsley|Monroe Beardley]] and [[William K. Wimsatt|William Wimsatt]], which maintained that "The design or intention of the author is neither available nor desirable as a standard for judging the success of a work of literary art."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Intentism: Public Debates 2009- 2011|last=Pelosi|first=Vittorio|publisher=Intentism Publishing House|year=2011|isbn=9781326730598|location=|pages=15-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the case of the French philosopher [[Roland Barthes]], who, in 1967, declared that the author is dead and that his work is nothing but a "tissue of quotations" and that the impression of the reader is more important.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He also cited [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[Deconstruction|deconstruction theory]], which critiques the relationship of text and meaning, and exposes meaning that run counter to what was intended by the author. Finally, Pelosi identified [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]'s theory that a text's meaning can change over time due to the changes that transpire in society. According to the thinker, these theories are outdated and that there is an imperative to identify, celebrate, and recognize the relationship between the artist and his creation because "all meaning is the imperfect outworking of intention."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

==Manifesto==
Intentists believe that art can convey an artist's intended message to his or her intended audience. As a movement it both recognizes and celebrates the relationship between an artist's creation and its creator.&lt;ref name="intentism.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intentism.com/manifesto.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Intentists believe three principles:&lt;ref name="intentism.com"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
::#Intentists believe that the artist is free to convey his or her intended message. The meaning of the work is found in the artist's intention and not the interpretation of the viewer. All meaning is simply the imperfect outworking of intention.&lt;ref name="culturewars.org.uk"/&gt;
::#Intentists believe a confused, hidden or denied intention leads to zero accountability.
::#Intentists believe that an omission of artist intention can lead to enforced restrictions on the artist and even censorship.

==Public debates and lectures==
Intentism has been the subject of several public debates. In 2009 The [[University of the Arts London]] held a Panel Discussion around Intentism entitled 'Intentism: Is an artist free to convey his or her intended message?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.ac.uk/alumni/bulletin09/mar/March%202009.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, The [[Royal College of Art]], held a debate on Intentism named 'Rebirth of the Author?'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battleofideas.org.uk/index.php/2011/session_detail/5750/]&lt;/ref&gt; Intentists have also given several Lectures at various art institutions including The [[University of East London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intentism.com/news.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the University of Kent.

==Artistic practice==
Intentist artists work in numerous ways, but at present there appears to be three areas that are of particular interest. Firstly, Intentists often celebrate the artist's intentions in the work by including the entire process of creating art in the final piece. Consequently, elements of every editing decision is left in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1stangel.co.uk/|title=1stAngel Arts – Life in and around the arts today|website=1stangel.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentists call this process ''Palimpsestism'' and the ''Intentional Trail''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intentismcommunity.webs.com/advertiserint2.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Secondly, since authorial irony can only be understood by comparing what is said (the work), and what is meant (author intent), it is a common subject for Intentist artists. An example here would be Luciano Pelosi’s Big Breakfast. Thirdly, much art theory finds its origin in [[Literary theory]]. It is a claim of the Intentists that in certain fundamental areas this cross over is not valid. In literature the author has a linear order expectation for the text since the viewer will normally start at the beginning and read letters sequentially until the end. However, this approach is not appropriate for the static arts. Most paintings and sculptures are anarrative as viewers can approach the work in multiple orders. Therefore, this basis for ignoring the artist’s intentions is not relevant. An example of an Intentist artist creating work to demonstrate these anarrative properties is Govinda Sah.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://govindasah.com|title=Govinda 'Sah' Azad|website=govindasah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The School of Postmodernism==
[[File:School of pomo.jpg|thumb|The School of Postmodernism by Vittorio Pelosi]]
Vittorio Pelosi's painting The School of [[Postmodernism]], inspired by [[Raphael]]'s [[The School of Athens]], is one of the best known paintings to come out of the Intentist movement and replaces all of Raphael's Athenian philosophers with [[Postmodern]] icons. Each figure is attempting an objective depiction of the life model, but their work is subjected to their postmodernist ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intentismcommunity.webs.com/schoolofpomo.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Intentists regularly exhibit their work, both in solo Intentist exhibitions and Intentist group shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intentism.com/exhibitions.htm|title=Intentism|website=Intentism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was known for his works of [[science fiction]] and [[popular science]]. Asimov was a [[List of prolific writers|prolific writer]] who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and [[postcard]]s.{{efn|{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Stanley |title=Yours, Isaac Asimov |date=1996 |quote=My estimate is that Isaac received about 100,000 letters in his professional career.

Asimov wrote [[hard science fiction]]. Along with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke]], Asimov was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freedman |first=Carl | author-link = Carl Freedman |title=Critical Theory and Science Fiction |publisher=Doubleday |date=2000 |page=71 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov's most famous work is the [[Foundation series|"Foundation" series]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblio.com/authors/212/Isaac_Asimov_Biography.html |title=Isaac Asimov Biography and List of Works |accessdate=March 5, 2008 |work=Biblio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; his other major series are the [[Isaac Asimov's Galactic Empire Series|"Galactic Empire" series]] and the [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|Robot series]]. The Galactic Empire novels are set in earlier history of the same fictional universe as the Foundation series. Later, with ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), he linked this distant future to the Robot stories, creating a unified "[[future history]]" for his stories much like those pioneered by Robert A. Heinlein and previously produced by [[Cordwainer Smith]] and [[Poul Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1994 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-41701-2 |pages=475–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote hundreds of short stories, including the [[social science fiction]] novelette "[[Nightfall (Asimov novelette and novel)|Nightfall]]"; in 1964, it was voted the best short science fiction story of all time by the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]]. Asimov wrote the [[Lucky Starr series|''Lucky Starr'' series]] of [[young adult fiction|juvenile]] science-fiction novels using the pen name Paul French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Opus 100 |year=1969 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |quote=So [Walter Bradbury] said, 'Use a pseudonym.'

Asimov also wrote [[mystery fiction|mysteries]] and [[fantasy]], as well as much nonfiction. Most of his popular science books explain concepts in a historical way, going as far back as possible to a time when the science in question was at its simplest stage. Examples include ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science|Guide to Science]]'', the three-volume set ''[[Understanding Physics]]'', and ''Asimov's Chronology of Science and Discovery'', as well as works on [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]], [[mathematics]], [[history]], and [[William Shakespeare]]'s writings.

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

==&lt;span id="name"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Family name etymology==
Asimov's family name derives from ''azimy'', a word for the [[winter cereals|winter crops]] in which his great-grandfather dealt, with the Russian [[patronymic]] ending "-ov" added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azimov is spelled {{lang|ru|Азимов}} in the [[Cyrillic alphabet]].&lt;ref name="azimov"&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the family arrived in the United States in 1923 and their name had to be spelled in Western letters, Asimov's father spelled it with an S, believing this letter to be pronounced like Z (as in German), and so it became Asimov.&lt;ref name="azimov"/&gt;{{efn|name="pronunciation"|{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |page=12 |quote=There are three very simple English words: 'Has,' 'him' and 'of.'

Asimov refused early suggestions of using a more common name as a pseudonym, and believed that its recognizability helped his career. After becoming famous, he often met readers who believed that "Isaac Asimov" was a distinctive pseudonym created by an author with a common name.{{r|earlyyears79_82}}

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Asimov was born in [[Petrovichi, Smolensk Oblast]], Russia on an unknown date between October 4, 1919 and January 2, 1920, inclusive. Asimov celebrated his birthday on January 2.{{efn|name="birthday"}}

Asimov's parents were Anna Rachel (née Berman) and Judah Asimov, a family of [[Jewish]] [[miller]]s. He was named Isaac after his mother's father, Isaac Berman.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green'', pp. 22, 30. Avon, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was born, his family lived in [[Petrovichi, Smolensk Oblast|Petrovichi]] near [[Klimavichy|Klimovichi]], which was then [[Gomel Governorate]] in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (now [[Smolensk Oblast]], Russia). Asimov wrote of his father, "My father, for all his education as an [[Orthodox Jew]], was not Orthodox in his heart", noting that "he didn't recite the [[Prayer in Judaism|myriad prayers prescribed for every action]], and he never made any attempt to teach them to me".&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''I. Asimov: A Memoir'', ch. 5. [[Random House]], 2009. {{ISBN|0-307-57353-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, Asimov and 16 other children in Petrovichi developed [[double pneumonia]]. Only Asimov survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |year=1975 |title=Before the Golden Age |publisher=Orbit |volume=1 |page=4 |isbn=0-8600-7803-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later had two younger siblings: a sister, Marcia (born Manya,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#non-literary12 Isaac Asimov FAQ], asimovonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; June 17, 1922&amp;nbsp;– April 2, 2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Marcia (Asimov) Repanes |url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/newsday/obituary.aspx?n=marcia-repanes-asimov&amp;pid=149980085&amp;fhid=3923 |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |newspaper=[[Newsday]] |date=April 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a brother, Stanley (July 25, 1929&amp;nbsp;– August 16, 1995),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stanley Asimov, 66, Newsday Executive |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/17/obituaries/stanley-asimov-66-newsday-executive.html |accessdate=August 11, 2011 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 17, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was vice-president of ''[[New York Newsday]]''.{{r|konstantin}}&lt;ref&gt;Robert F. Keeler, "Newsday: a candid history of the respectable tabloid", 1990, {{ISBN|1-55710-053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov's family travelled to the United States via Liverpool on the SS ''Baltic'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/ukoutwardpassengerlists/?name=_Asimow&amp;count=50&amp;departure=1923-2-3_liverpool-lancashire-england-united+kingdom_92187&amp;departure_x=0-0-0_1-0&amp;e-Self-Destination=_new+york-usa_35&amp;e-Self-Destination_x=_1-0&amp;f-F0005959=Baltic&amp;f-F0005959_x=1&amp;name_x=_1&amp;pcat=img_passlists|title=Ancestry.com|last=Passenger list|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving on February 13, 1923&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ancestry.com/search/collections/nypl/?name=_Asimy&amp;arrival=1923-2-13_new+york-usa_35&amp;arrival_x=0-0-0_1-0&amp;count=50&amp;f-F0005959=Baltic&amp;f-F0005959_x=1&amp;name_x=_1&amp;pcat=img_passlists|title=Ancestry.com|last=Passenger list|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; when he was three years old. Since his parents always spoke [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and English with him, he never learned [[Russian language|Russian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=It's Been a Good Life |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |editor=Janet Asimov |date=2002 |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |location=Amherst, New York |isbn=1-57392-968-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he remained fluent in Yiddish as well as English. Growing up in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five, and his mother got him into [[educational stage#United States|first grade]] a year early by claiming he was born on September 7, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1994|publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Memory Yet Green |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon Books |date=1979 |isbn=0-380-75432-0 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In third grade he learned about the "error" and insisted on an official correction of the date to January 2.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green'', chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming established in the U.S., his parents owned a succession of [[candy store]]s in which everyone in the family was expected to work. The candy stores sold newspapers and magazines, a fact that Asimov credited as a major influence in his lifelong love of the written word, as it presented him with an unending supply of new reading material as a child that he could not have otherwise afforded. He became a [[Naturalization|naturalized]] U.S. citizen in 1928 at the age of eight.&lt;ref name=konstantin&gt;{{cite web |url=http://americanindian.net/asimov.html |title=An Interview with Isaac Asimov |last=Konstantin |first=Phil |work=americanindian.net |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and career ===
Asimov attended New York City public schools from age 5, including [[Boys and Girls High School|Boys High School]] in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="Early Asimov"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Early Asimov Volume 1 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |page=10 |publisher=[[Panther Books]] |location=[[St. Albans]], Hertfordshire, UK |date=1973 |isbn=0-586-03806-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating at 15, he attended the [[City College of New York]] for several days before accepting a scholarship at Seth Low Junior College, a branch of [[Columbia University]] in [[Downtown Brooklyn]] designed to absorb some of the Jewish and [[Italian-American]] students who applied to [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], then the institution's primary undergraduate school for men with quotas on the number of admissions from those [[ethnic groups]]. Originally a [[zoology]] major, Asimov switched to [[chemistry]] after his first semester as he disapproved of "dissecting an alley cat". After Seth Low Junior College closed in 1938, Asimov finished his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at University Extension (later the [[Columbia University School of General Studies]]) in 1939.

After two rounds of rejections by medical schools, in 1939, Asimov applied to the graduate program in chemistry at Columbia; initially rejected and then accepted only on a probationary basis,&lt;ref name="earlyyears180_183"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/180/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=180–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; he completed his [[Master of Arts]] degree in chemistry in 1941 and earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in [[biochemistry]] in 1948.

In between earning these two degrees, Asimov spent three years during [[World War II]] working as a civilian chemist at the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]'s Naval Air Experimental Station, living in the [[Walnut Hill, Philadelphia|Walnut Hill]] section of [[West Philadelphia]] from 1942 to 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Edward |last1=Seiler |first2=John H. |last2=Jenkin |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#non-literary6 |title=Frequently Asked Questions about Isaac Asimov |publisher=asimovonline.com |date=1994–2014 |accessdate=July 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Bart |last=Everts|url=http://hiddencityphila.org/2014/07/sci-phi-isaac-asimovs-west-philly-years/ |title=SciPhi: Isaac Asimov's West Philly Years|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1945, he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]; if he had not had his birth date corrected while at school, he would have been officially 26 years old and ineligible.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac.

In 1959, after a recommendation from [[Arthur Obermayer]], Asimov's friend and a scientist on the U.S. missile protection project, Asimov was approached by [[DARPA]] to join Obermayer's team. Asimov declined on the grounds that his ability to write freely would be impaired should he receive [[classified information]].

=== Personal life ===
Asimov married Gertrude Blugerman (1917, [[Toronto]], Canada&amp;nbsp;– 1990, [[Boston]], U.S.) on July 26, 1942. The couple lived in an apartment in [[West Philadelphia]], while Asimov was employed at the Philadelphia Navy Yard (where two of his co-workers were [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and [[Robert A. Heinlein]]). They moved to [[Boston]] in May 1949, then to nearby suburbs [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]] in July 1949, [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]] in May 1951, and finally [[West Newton, Massachusetts|West Newton]] in 1956. They had two children, David (born 1951) and Robyn Joan (born 1955).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html |title=Isaac Asimov FAQ |work=asimovonline.com |accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, they separated, and Asimov moved back to New York, this time to the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]], where he lived for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov wrote in 1969 that "periodic trips to New York ... have, more and more, become a kind of highlight to my life". {{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/244/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately began seeing [[Janet Asimov|Janet O.

Asimov was a claustrophile: he enjoyed small, enclosed spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1994 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-41701-2 |pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/244/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=244|quote=I wrote a novel in 1953 which pictured a world in which everyone lived in underground cities, comfortably enclosed away from the open air.

Asimov was [[fear of flying|afraid of flying]], doing so only twice: once in the course of his work at the Naval Air Experimental Station and once returning home from [[Oahu]] in 1946. Consequently, he seldom traveled great distances. This phobia influenced several of his fiction works, such as the [[Wendell Urth]] mystery stories and the ''Robot'' novels featuring [[Elijah Baley]]. In his later years, Asimov found enjoyment traveling on [[cruise ship]]s, beginning in 1972 when he viewed the [[Apollo 17]] launch from a cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, I. (1973) "The Cruise and I", in ''The Tragedy of the Moon'' (1973, Dell), chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; On several cruises, he was part of the entertainment program, giving science-themed talks aboard ships such as the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|RMS ''Queen Elizabeth II'']].&lt;ref name="Acrophobia"&gt;{{cite book |title=I.

Asimov was an able public speaker and was a frequent fixture at [[science fiction convention]]s, where he was friendly and approachable.&lt;ref name="Acrophobia" /&gt; He patiently answered tens of thousands of questions and other mail with postcards and was pleased to give autographs. He was of medium height, stocky, with - in his later years - "mutton-chop" [[sideburns]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/42222-astounding-science-fiction-book-excerpt.html|title=Asimov's Sword: Excerpt from 'Astounding' History of Science Fiction|last=Lewin|first=Sarah|date=23 October 2018|website=[[Space.com]]|publisher=[[Purch Group|Purch]]|access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/06/entertainment/la-et-jc-harlan-ellison-isaac-asimov-studs-terkel-together-video-20130503|title=Harlan Ellison, Isaac Asimov, Studs Terkel together in 1982 video|last=Kellogg|first=Carolyn|date=6 May 2013|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Ross Levinsohn]]|access-date=9 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a distinct [[New York accent]]. His physical dexterity was very poor. He never learned to swim or ride a bicycle; however, he did learn to drive a car after he moved to Boston. In his humor book ''Asimov Laughs Again'', he describes Boston driving as "anarchy on wheels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |location=New York |isbn=0-06-016826-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov's wide interests included his participation in his later years in organizations devoted to the [[comic opera]]s of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]&lt;ref name="Acrophobia" /&gt; and in The Wolfe Pack,&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nerowolfe.org/ NeroWolfe.org]&lt;/ref&gt; a group of devotees of the [[Nero Wolfe]] mysteries written by [[Rex Stout]]. Many of his short stories mention or quote Gilbert and Sullivan.&lt;ref&gt;White (2005), pp. 83 and 219–20&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prominent member of [[The Baker Street Irregulars]], the leading [[Sherlock Holmes]] society,&lt;ref name="Acrophobia" /&gt; for whom he wrote an essay arguing that Professor Moriarty's work "The Dynamics of An Asteroid" involved the willful destruction of an ancient civilized planet. He was also a member of the all-male literary banqueting club the [[Trap Door Spiders]], which served as the basis of his fictional group of mystery solvers, the [[Black Widowers]].&lt;ref name="Asimov_p376-377"&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''I. Asimov, a Memoir'', New York, Doubleday, 1994, pages 376–377.&lt;/ref&gt; He later used his essay on Moriarty's work as the basis for a Black Widowers story, "[[The Ultimate Crime]]", which appeared in ''[[More Tales of the Black Widowers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac.

In 1984, the [[American Humanist Association]] (AHA) named him the Humanist of the Year. He was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |title=Humanist Manifesto II |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=October 2, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020110719/http://www.americanhumanist.org/humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II |archivedate=October 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1985 until his death in 1992, he served as president of the AHA, an honorary appointment. His successor was his friend and fellow writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]]. He was also a close friend of ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], and earned a screen credit as "special science consultant" on ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' for advice he gave during production.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/09/isaacasimov|title=Isaac Asimov|last=|first=|date=July 22, 2008|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|Guardian News and Media Limited]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510164909/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/09/isaacasimov|archive-date=May 10, 2017|dead-url=no|work=The Guardian|accessdate=March 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview ===
{{Robotic laws}}
Asimov's career can be divided into several periods. His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction in 1952, co-authoring a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii–xv |nopp=true |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his "[[Three Laws of Robotics]]" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].&lt;ref&gt;''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&amp;nbsp;329&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words "[[robotics]]", "[[positronic brain|positronic]]" (an entirely fictional technology), and "[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term "robotics" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word "psychohistory", the word "robotics" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with "[[positronic brain]]s" and the first-season episode "[[Datalore]]" called the positronic brain "Asimov's dream".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov began writing at the age of 11. His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, "Cosmic Corkscrew" (now lost), that year. On 17 May 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street &amp; Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on 19 June 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=12–13, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, "[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]". Campbell rejected it on 22 July but—in "the nicest possible letter you could imagine"—encouraged him to continue writing, promising that Asimov might sell his work after another year and a dozen stories of practice.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} In October 1938, he sold the third story he finished, "[[Marooned Off Vesta]]", to ''[[Amazing Stories]]'', edited by [[Raymond A. Palmer]], and it appeared in the March 1939 issue. Asimov was paid $64 ({{Inflation|US|64|1938|fmt=eq}}), or one cent a word.&lt;ref name="earlyyears25_28"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/24/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first= Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more stories appeared that year, "[[The Weapon Too Dreadful to Use]]" in the May ''Amazing'' and "[[Trends (short story)|Trends]]" in the July ''Astounding'', the issue fans later selected as the start of the [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]].{{r|earlyyears79_82}} For 1940, [[ISFDB]] catalogs seven stories in four different pulp magazines, including one in ''Astounding''.&lt;ref name=isfdb /&gt; His earnings became enough to pay for his education, but not yet enough for him to become a full-time writer.{{r|earlyyears25_28}}

Asimov later said that unlike other top Golden Age writers [[Robert Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]—also first published in 1939, and whose talent and stardom were immediately obvious—he "(this is not false modesty) came up only gradually".&lt;ref name="earlyyears79_82"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/78/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=79–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through 29 July 1940, Asimov wrote 22 stories in 25 months, of which 13 were published; he wrote in 1972 that from that date he never wrote a science fiction story (except for two "special cases") that was not published.&lt;ref name="earlyyears245"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/245/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was famous enough that [[Donald Wollheim]] told Asimov that he purchased "[[The Secret Sense]]" for a new magazine only because of his name,&lt;ref name="earlyyears166_169"&gt;{{Cite book |url= https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/166/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=166–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the December 1940 issue of ''Astonishing''—featuring Asimov's name in bold—was the first magazine to base [[cover art]] on his work,&lt;ref name="earlyyears202_205"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/202/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=202–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Asimov later said that neither he himself nor anyone else—except perhaps Campbell—considered him better than an often published "third rater".{{r|earlyyears335_339}}

Based on a conversation with Campbell, Asimov wrote his 32nd story in March and April 1941, which ''Astounding'' published in September 1941. In 1968 the [[Science Fiction Writers of America]] voted "[[Nightfall (Asimov short story)|Nightfall]]" the best science fiction short story ever written.&lt;ref name="earlyyears335_339"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/334/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=335–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=obit /&gt; In ''[[Nightfall and Other Stories]]'' Asimov wrote, "The writing of 'Nightfall' was a watershed in my professional career. ... . I was suddenly taken seriously and the world of science fiction became aware that I existed. As the years passed, in fact, it became evident that I had written a 'classic'."&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, I. ''Nightfall and Other Stories''  (1969)  (Grafton Books 1991 edition, pp. 9–10)&lt;/ref&gt; "Nightfall" is an archetypal example of [[social science fiction]], a term he created to describe a new trend in the 1940s, led by authors including him and Heinlein, away from [[gadget]]s and [[space opera]] and toward speculation about the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Science Fiction: Its Meaning and Its Future |last=Bretnor |first=Reginald |authorlink=Reginald Bretnor |date=1953 |publisher=Coward-McCann |location=New York |pages=157–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After writing "[[Victory Unintentional]]" in January and February 1942, Asimov did not write another story for a year. Asimov expected to make chemistry his career, and was paid $2,600 annually at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, enough to marry his girlfriend; he did not expect to make much more from writing than the $1,788.50 he had earned from 28 stories sold over four years. Asimov left science fiction fandom and no longer read new magazines, and might have left the industry had not Heinlein and de Camp been coworkers and previously sold stories continued to appear.&lt;ref name="earlyyears390_397"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/390/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=390–397}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, Asimov published the first of his ''Foundation'' stories—later collected in the [[Foundation Trilogy|''Foundation'' trilogy]]: ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]'' (1951), ''[[Foundation and Empire]]'' (1952), and ''[[Second Foundation]]'' (1953). The books recount the fall of a vast [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|interstellar empire]] and the establishment of its eventual successor. They also feature his fictional science of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]], in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/cole_11_12/ |title=Clarkesworld Magazine&amp;nbsp;– Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy |work=Clarkesworld Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trilogy and [[Isaac Asimov's Robot Series|''Robot ''series]] are his most famous science fiction. In 1966 they won the [[Hugo Award]] for the all-time best series of science fiction and fantasy novels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1966.html The Long List of Hugo Awards, 1966] at nesfa.org (retrieved April 24, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell raised his rate per word, [[Orson Welles]] purchased rights to "[[Evidence (short story)|Evidence]]", and anthologies reprinted his stories. By the end of the war Asimov was earning as a writer an amount equal to half of his Navy Yard salary, even after a raise, but Asimov still did not believe that writing could support him, his wife, and future children.&lt;ref name="earlyyears442_443"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/442/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=442–443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earlyyears466_470"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/466/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=466–470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[Robot series (Asimov)|"positronic" robot stories]]—many of which were collected in ''[[I, Robot]]'' (1950)—were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of [[ethics]] for robots (see [[Three Laws of Robotics]]) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection ''[[The Complete Robot]]'' (1982) that he was largely inspired by the almost relentless tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a [[Frankenstein]] plot in which they destroyed their creators.

The robot series has led to film adaptations. With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to "the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994. The 2004 movie ''[[I, Robot (film)|I, Robot]]'', starring [[Will Smith]], was based on an unrelated script by [[Jeff Vintar]] titled ''Hardwired'', with Asimov's ideas incorporated later after the rights to Asimov's title were acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/bottom/56.html |title=The Bottom of Things |first=Michael |last=Sampson |date=January 14, 2004 |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212180512/http://www.moviepoopshoot.com/bottom/56.html |archivedate=February 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (The title was not original to Asimov but had previously been used for [[I, Robot (short story)|a story]] by [[Eando Binder]].) Also, one of Asimov's robot short stories, "[[The Bicentennial Man]]", was expanded into a novel ''[[The Positronic Man]]'' by Asimov and [[Robert Silverberg]], and this was adapted into the 1999 movie ''[[Bicentennial Man (film)|Bicentennial Man]]'', starring [[Robin Williams]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com" /&gt;

Besides movies, his ''Foundation'' and ''Robot'' stories have inspired other derivative works of science fiction literature, many by well-known and established authors such as [[Roger MacBride Allen]], [[Greg Bear]], [[Gregory Benford]], [[David Brin]], and [[Donald Kingsbury]]. At least some of these appear to have been done with the blessing of, or at the request of, Asimov's widow, [[Janet Asimov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?4327 |title=Series: Isaac Asimov's Robot Mysteries |publisher=ISFDB |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pe.cgi?3792 |title=Series: Second Foundation Trilogy |publisher=ISFDB |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?26941 |title=Publication: Psychohistorical Crisis |publisher=ISFDB |accessdate=August 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, he also wrote a [[False document|spoof chemistry article]], "[[Thiotimoline|The Endochronic Properties of Resublimated Thiotimoline]]". At the time, Asimov was preparing his own doctoral [[dissertation]], and for the oral examination to follow that. Fearing a prejudicial reaction from his graduate school evaluation board at [[Columbia University]], Asimov asked his editor that it be released under a pseudonym, yet it appeared under his own name. Asimov grew concerned at the scrutiny he would receive at his oral examination, in case the examiners thought he wasn't taking science seriously. At the end of the examination, one evaluator turned to him, smiling, and said, "What can you tell us, Mr. Asimov, about the thermodynamic properties of the compound known as thiotimoline". Laughing hysterically with relief, Asimov had to be led out of the room. After a five-minute wait, he was summoned back into the room and congratulated as "Dr. Asimov".&lt;ref name="earlyyears488_501"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/488/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=488–501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demand for science fiction greatly increased during the 1950s. It became possible for a genre author to write full-time.&lt;ref name="latham2009"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Routledge Companion to Science Fiction |last=Latham |first=Rob |publisher=Routledge |year=2009 |isbn=9781135228361 |editor-last=Bould |editor-first=Mark |pages=80–89 |chapter=Fiction, 1950-1963 |editor-last2=Butler |editor-first2=Andrew M. |editor-last3=Roberts |editor-first3=Adam |editor-last4=Vint |editor-first4=Sherryl |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y7CNAgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;ots=QpsnWwPrOs&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, book publisher [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]'s science fiction editor Walter I. Bradbury accepted Asimov's unpublished "Grow Old With Me" (40,000 words), but requested that it be extended to a full novel of 70,000 words. The book appeared under the Doubleday imprint in January 1950 with the title of ''[[Pebble in the Sky]]''.&lt;ref name="earlyyears560_564"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/560/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=560–564}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doubleday published five more original science fiction novels by Asimov in the 1950s, along with the six juvenile [[Lucky Starr series|Lucky Starr novels]], the latter under the pseudonym of "Paul French".&lt;ref&gt;''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 627&lt;/ref&gt; Doubleday also published collections of Asimov's short stories, beginning with ''[[The Martian Way and Other Stories]]'' in 1955. The early 1950s also saw [[Gnome Press]] publish one collection of Asimov's positronic robot stories as ''[[I, Robot]]'' and his ''[[The Foundation Series|Foundation]]'' stories and novelettes as the three books of the ''Foundation trilogy''. More positronic robot stories were republished in book form as ''[[The Rest of the Robots]]''.

Books and the magazines ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction|Galaxy]]'', and ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' ended Asimov's dependence on ''Astounding''. He later described the era as his "'mature' period". Asimov's "[[The Last Question]]" (1956), on the ability of humankind to cope with and potentially reverse the process of [[entropy]], was his personal favorite story.&lt;ref name="asimov1973"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Best of Isaac Asimov |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Sphere Books |year=1973 |isbn=0-385-05078-X |pages=ix-xiv |chapter=Introduction |lccn=74-2863 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/bestofisaacasimo00asim#page/n11/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, his novel ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' (which was not part of a series) was published to general acclaim, and it won the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]],&lt;ref name = "Jupiter174"&gt;Asimov (1975) ''Buy Jupiter and Other Stories'', VGSF (1988 ed.) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]],&lt;ref name = "Jupiter174" /&gt; and the [[Locus Award for Best Novel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Locus1973.html|title=1973 Awards|work=The Locus Index to SF Awards|accessdate=September 8, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001063632/http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/Locus1973.html|archivedate=October 1, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1974, former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[Paul McCartney]] approached Asimov and asked him if he could write the screenplay for a science-fiction movie musical. McCartney had a vague idea for the plot and a small scrap of dialogue; he wished to make a film about a rock band whose members discover they are being impersonated by a group of extraterrestrials. The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career. Intrigued by the idea, although he was not generally a fan of rock music, Asimov quickly produced a "treatment" or brief outline of the story. He adhered to McCartney's overall idea, producing a story he felt to be moving and dramatic. However, he did not make use of McCartney's brief scrap of dialogue, and probably as a consequence, McCartney rejected the story. The treatment now exists only in the Boston University archives.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, I. (1980) ''In Joy Still Felt'' Avon, p. 693&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov said in 1969 that he had "the happiest of all my associations with science fiction magazines" with ''Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction''; "I have no complaints about ''Astounding'', ''Galaxy'', or any of the rest, heaven knows, but ''F &amp; SF'' has become something special to me".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/224/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1977, Asimov lent his name to ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'' (now ''[[Asimov's Science Fiction]]'') and penned an editorial for each issue. There was also a short-lived ''[[Asimov's SF Adventure Magazine]]'' and a companion ''Asimov's Science Fiction Anthology'' reprint series, published as magazines (in the same manner as the stablemates ''[[Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine]]''{{'}}s and ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]''{{'}}s "anthologies").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= I. Asimov: A Memoir| first= Isaac| last= Asimov| pages= 428–429}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his ''Foundation'' series,&lt;ref name="wiredforbooks" /&gt; he did so with ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'' (1982) and ''[[Foundation and Earth]]'' (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with ''[[Prelude to Foundation]]'' (1988) and ''[[Forward the Foundation]]'' (1992), his last novel.

=== Popular science ===
During the late 1950s and 1960s, Asimov substantially decreased his fiction output (he published only four adult novels between 1957's ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' and 1982's ''[[Foundation's Edge]]'', two of which were mysteries). He greatly increased his nonfiction production, writing mostly on science topics; the launch of Sputnik in 1957 engendered [[Sputnik crisis|public concern over a "science gap"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I.

''Fantasy and Science Fiction'' invited Asimov to continue his regular nonfiction column, begun in the now-folded bimonthly companion magazine ''[[Venture Science Fiction Magazine]]''. The first of 399 monthly ''F&amp;SF'' columns appeared in November 1958, until his terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/Essays/f_and_sf_essays.html List of Asimov's essays for ''F&amp;SF'' at Asimovonline.com] (Retrieved 28 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name="400th essay"|A 400th essay, a compilation of excerpts from his earlier essays edited by his widow Janet Jeppson Asimov, was published in the magazine in 1994.}} These columns, periodically collected into books by Doubleday, gave Asimov a reputation as a "Great Explainer" of science; he described them as his only popular science writing in which he never had to assume complete ignorance of the subjects on the part of his readers. The column was ostensibly dedicated to popular science but Asimov had complete editorial freedom, and wrote about contemporary social issues{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} in essays such as "Thinking About Thinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=January 1975 |title=Thinking About Thinking |magazine=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |location=New York |publisher=Mercury Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Knock Plastic!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=November 1967 |title=Knock Plastic! |magazine=The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction |location=New York |publisher=Mercury Press, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov's first wide-ranging reference work, ''[[The Intelligent Man's Guide to Science]]'' (1960), was nominated for a [[National Book Award]], and in 1963 he won a [[Hugo Award]] – his first – for his essays for ''F&amp;SF''.&lt;ref name="1963hugo"&gt;[http://www.nesfa.org/data/LL/Hugos/hugos1963.html 1963 Hugo Award winners] at the New England Science Fiction Association website (retrieved 22 October 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of his science books and the income he derived from them allowed him to give up most academic responsibilities and become a full-time [[freelance writer]].&lt;ref&gt;''I.

The great variety of information covered in Asimov's writings prompted [[Kurt Vonnegut]] to ask, "How does it feel to know everything?"

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov said that "Of all the writing I do, fiction, non-fiction, adult, or juvenile, these ''F &amp; SF'' articles are by far the most fun".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/298/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=299}}&lt;/ref&gt; He regretted, however, that he had less time for fiction—causing dissatisfied readers to send him letters of complaint—stating in 1969 that "In the last ten years, I've done a couple of novels, some collections, a dozen or so stories, but that's ''nothing''".{{r|nightfall321}}

==== Coined terms ====
Asimov coined the term "[[robotics]]" in his 1941 story "[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]",&lt;ref&gt;According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary,'' the term "robotics" was first used in the short story "Liar!" published in the May 1941 issue of ''Astounding Science Fiction''.&lt;/ref&gt; though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word, as he stated in ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' ("The Robot Chronicles"). While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story "[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager &lt;!-- was Eos --&gt; |date=1996 &lt;!-- was 2003 --&gt; |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224–225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=[[Counting the Eons]] |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented . ... . the word}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov also coined the term "[[spome]]" in a paper entitled, "There's No Place Like Spome" in ''Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.locusmag.com/index/yr2000/s3.htm |title=Atmosphere in Space Cabins and Closed Environments |publisher=Locusmag.com |date= |accessdate=June 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; originally presented as a paper to the American Chemical Society on September 13, 1965. It refers to any system closed with respect to matter and open with respect to energy capable of sustaining human life indefinitely.

Asimov coined the term "[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942–1944) which would later be collected as the 1951 novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4–8 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somewhat later, the term "[[psychohistory]]" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.

=== Other writings ===
In addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Egyptians'' (1967)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes—covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969—and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970), ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).&lt;ref&gt;''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing "pure" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii–xiii |nopp=true |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of "George" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.&lt;ref name="Asimov 1971"&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Asimov 1992"&gt;{{cite book |title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by "J") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by "M"), Asimov published ''The Sensuous Dirty Old Man'' under the byline "Dr. 'A{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=2016-08-29|work=io9|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]]. ''In Memory Yet Green'' (1979)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920–1954 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1979 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-13679-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1979 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-13679-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; cover his life up to 1978. The third volume, ''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1994 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-41701-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered his whole life (rather than following on from where the second volume left off). The epilogue was written by his widow [[Janet Asimov]] after his death. The book won a [[Hugo Award]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1995-hugo-awards/ List of 1995 Hugo Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5yVVGP9s3?url=http://www.thehugoawards.org/hugo-history/1995-hugo-awards/ |date=May 7, 2011 }} at the official website. (Retrieved March 25, 2016.)&lt;/ref&gt; Janet Asimov edited ''[[It's Been a Good Life]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=It's Been a Good Life |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=2002 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=New York |isbn=1-57392-968-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; a condensed version of his three autobiographies. He also published three volumes of retrospectives of his writing, ''[[Opus 100]]'' (1969),&lt;ref name="Asimov 1969"&gt;{{cite book |title=Opus 100 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1969 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Opus 200]]'' (1979),&lt;ref name="Asimov 1979"&gt;{{cite book |title=Opus 200 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1979 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-27625-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Opus 300'' (1984).&lt;ref name="Asimov 1984"&gt;{{cite book |title=Opus 300 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1984 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston |isbn=0-395-36108-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the Asimovs co-wrote ''How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort''. In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |last=Asimov |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Asimov |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |date=1987 |publisher=Walker &amp; Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8027-0945-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book362.html |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |publisher=John H.

Asimov and ''[[Star Trek]]'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] developed a unique relationship during ''Star Trek''{{'}}s initial launch in the late 1960s. Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Calendar}}
In 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A–D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., "D-73" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=[[The Tragedy of the Moon]] |pages=48–58 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards and recognition ===

Asimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.&lt;ref name=SFAwards&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 "Asimov, Isaac"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

== Writing style ==
{{quote|If I had the critic's mentality (which I emphatically don't) I would sit down and try to analyze my stories, work out the factors that make some more successful than others, cultivate those factors, and simply explode with excellence.

But the devil with that. I won't buy success at the price of self-consciousness. I don't have the temperament for it. I'll write as I please and let the critics do the analyzing.|Asimov, 1973{{r|asimov1973}}}}

=== Characteristics ===
Asimov wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard. He imagined an ending first, then a beginning, then "let everything in-between work itself out as I come to it". (Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as "like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes. After disliking making multiple revisions of "[[Black Friar of the Flame]]", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions ("like chewing used gum"), stating that "too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process". He submitted "failures" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}&lt;ref name="earlyyears142_145"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City NY |pages=142–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':

{{quote|Except for two stories—"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]" and "[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]"—they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction—play themselves on a relatively bare stage.&lt;ref name="IASFM-Gunn"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56–81 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Asimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':

{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing—to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics—Well, they can do whatever they wish.&lt;ref name="Nemesis-Authour's note"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of "Liar!". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in "Liar!" and "Evidence", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.

Other than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of "literary" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:

{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' "reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose "need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp.222–223&lt;/ref&gt;), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create "[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]", one of the early ''Robot'' stories. See ''In Memory Yet Green'' for details of that time period.) Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a "dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of "kyrt"&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov fan" could enjoy it. Asimov's tendency to contort his timelines is perhaps most apparent in his later novel ''Nemesis'', in which one group of characters lives in the "present" and another group starts in the "past", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Limitations ===

==== Sexuality ====
Asimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the "early imprinting" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and "didn't know anything about girls".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}&lt;/ref&gt; which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.

==== Alien life ====
Asimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.&lt;ref name="Early Asimov" /&gt; Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,&lt;ref name="WWE" /&gt; and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.&lt;ref name="WWE" /&gt; Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novella "[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a "compu-drama", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov ("Gregory Laborian") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=109–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Portrayal of women ====
Asimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' ("Women and Science Fiction"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s "Book World" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:

{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}

However, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author. The answer is, "Not necessarily—" And yet one ought to add another short phrase "—but usually."|Asimov, 1969&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/164/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Religion ===
Isaac Asimov was an [[Atheism|atheist]], a [[Humanism|humanist]], and a [[Rationalism|rationalist]].&lt;ref name="Popper"&gt;Isaac Asimov, "The Way of Reason", in ''In Pursuit of Truth: Essays on the Philosophy of Karl Popper on the Occasion of his 80th Birthday,,'' ed. [[Paul Levinson]], Humanities Press, 1982, pp. ix–x.&lt;/ref&gt; He did not oppose religious conviction in others, but he frequently railed against [[superstition|superstitious]] and [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] beliefs that tried to pass themselves off as genuine science. During his childhood, his father and mother observed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] traditions, though not as stringently as they had in Petrovichi; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 13, he chose not to have a [[bar mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;''In Memory Yet Green'', p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; As his books ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' and ''Asimov Laughs Again'' record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, [[Satan]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Jerusalem]], and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.&lt;ref name="Asimov 1971"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Asimov 1992"/&gt;

For a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, "shine as a learned scholar"&lt;ref&gt;Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920–1954''. Doubleday, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a "[[Humanism|humanist]]" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': "I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish."&lt;ref&gt;"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10–13. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,

{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist. I don't have the evidence to prove that God doesn't exist, but I so strongly suspect he doesn't that I don't want to waste my time.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac Asimov on Science and the Bible (Free Inquiry&amp;nbsp;– Spring 1982)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Likewise he said about religious education: "I would not be satisfied to have my kids choose to be religious without trying to argue them out of it, just as I would not be satisfied to have them decide to smoke regularly or engage in any other practice I consider detrimental to mind or body."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=Corvallis Secular Society |year=1997 |title=Isaac Asimov on religion |url=http://css.peak.org/newsletter/1997/aug97/asimov.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051127124434/http://css.peak.org/newsletter/1997/aug97/asimov.html |archivedate=November 27, 2005 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last volume of autobiography, Asimov wrote,

{{quote|If I were not an atheist, I would believe in a God who would choose to save people on the basis of the totality of their lives and not the pattern of their words. I think he would prefer an honest and righteous atheist to a TV preacher whose every word is God, God, God, and whose every deed is foul, foul, foul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same memoir states his belief that [[Hell]] is "the drooling dream of a [[sadistic personality disorder|sadist]]" crudely affixed to an all-merciful God; if even human governments were willing to curtail cruel and unusual punishments, wondered Asimov, why would punishment in the afterlife not be restricted to a limited term? Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who "slandered God by inventing Hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=336–338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asimov said about using religious motifs in his writing:

{{quote|I tend to ignore religion in my own stories altogether, except when I absolutely have to have it. ... and, whenever I bring in a religious motif, that religion is bound to seem vaguely Christian because that is the only religion I know anything about, even though it is not mine. An unsympathetic reader might think that I am "burlesquing" Christianity, but I am not. Then too, it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Asimov |title=Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection |year=1995 |pages=297–302}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Politics ===
Asimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]]. He was unhappy about what he considered an "irrationalist" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a "no-man's land of the spirit" from which he wondered if they would ever return.&lt;ref name="joy"&gt;{{cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954–1978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, New York |isbn=0-385-15544-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Asimov's name appeared in the mid-1960s on a list of people the [[Communist Party USA]] "considered amenable" to its goals, the [[FBI]] investigated him. Because of his academic background, the bureau briefly considered Asimov as a possible candidate for known Soviet spy ROBPROF, but found nothing suspicious in his life or background.&lt;ref name="skelding20131107"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/nov/07/isaac-asimov-fbi-file-ROBPROF/ |title="Inimical to the best interests of the United States." Isaac Asimov's FBI File |last=Skelding |first=Conor |website=MuckRock |publication-date=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though from a Jewish family, Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards [[Israel]]. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it has been created among hostile neighbours, and that Jews have merely created for themselves another "Jewish ghetto".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |quote=Chapter 130: When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast. I said, "We are building ourselves a ghetto. We will be surrounded by tens of millions of Muslims who will never forgive, never forget and never go away."... But don't Jews deserve a homeland? Actually, I feel that no human group deserves a "homeland" in the usual sense of the word. ... I am not a Zionist, then, because I don't believe in nations, and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world.}}}}

=== Social issues ===
Asimov believed that "''science'' fiction ... serve[s] the good of humanity".{{r|asimov196708}} He considered himself a [[feminism|feminist]] even before [[women's liberation]] became a widespread movement; he argued that the issue of [[women's rights]] was closely connected to that of population control.&lt;ref name="YIA" /&gt; Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a "moral right" on population grounds, as must all [[consent]]ing adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction.&lt;ref name="YIA" /&gt; He issued many appeals for [[population control]], reflecting a perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part I |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf |work=transcript page 6, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1988 interview by [[Bill Moyers]], Asimov proposed [[computer-aided learning]], where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part II |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov2.pdf |work=transcript page 3, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world. Also, the [[One to one computing|one-to-one]] model would let students learn at their own pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Isaac Asimov on His Hopes for the Future (Part Two) |url=http://billmoyers.com/content/isaac-asimov-part-two/ |work=October 21, 1988 PBS broadcast ''Moyers and Company'' |accessdate=October 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment and population ===
Asimov's defense of civil applications of [[nuclear power]] even after the [[Three Mile Island]] nuclear power plant incident damaged his relations with some of his fellow liberals. In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'',&lt;ref name="YIA"&gt;Asimov, Isaac (1996). ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; he states that although he would prefer living in "no danger whatsoever" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near "a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].&lt;ref name="YIA"/&gt;

In the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question "What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?", Asimov responded:

{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it. As you put more and more people onto the world, the value of life not only declines, but it disappears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=editor |first1=Bill Moyers ; Betty Sue Flowers, |title=A world of ideas : conversations with thoughtful men and women about American life today and the ideas shaping our future |date=1989 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn=0-385-26278-7 |page=6 |edition=1st |url=http://www-tc.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Other authors ===
Asimov enjoyed the writings of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], using ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a plot point in a [[Black Widowers]] story.&lt;ref name="asimov1976"&gt;{{Cite book |title=More Tales of the Black Widowers |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1976 |isbn=0-385-11176-2 |pages=62–76 |chapter=Nothing Like Murder |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/moretalesofblack00asim#page/62/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Tolkien said that he enjoyed Asimov's science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{ME-ref|Letters|No. 294}}&lt;/ref&gt;) He acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of [[Harlan Ellison]], "He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am."&lt;ref&gt;''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov disapproved of the New Wave's growing influence, however, stating in 1967 "I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction".{{r|asimov196708}} The feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called "Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/books/isaac-asimov-faq/part3/ |title=Isaac Asimov FAQ, Part 3, 5.5 |date=February 9, 2001 |accessdate=January 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: "In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer."

Asimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because "I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote "I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?"&lt;ref&gt;''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be "a slapdash and sloppy writer."&lt;ref&gt;''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of psychohistory inspired him to become an economist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, ''Who Are You Calling Dense?'' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, "It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, ''The Unauthorized Life'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201–216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Few individuals", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L. Christian]], "understood better than Isaac Asimov what synoptic thinking is all about. His almost 500 books—which he wrote as a specialist, a knowledgeable authority, or just an excited layman—range over almost all conceivable subjects: the sciences, history, literature, religion, and of course, science fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|last=Christian|first=James L.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asimov explained his quest for holistic knowledge:

{{quote|Through a series of developments of absorbing lack of interest (as far as these pages are concerned), I found myself doing research on a biochemical topic. In that area of study I obtained my Ph.D., and in no time at all I was teaching biochemistry at a medical school.

But even that was too wide a subject. From books to nonfiction, to science, to chemistry, to biochemistry—and not yet enough. The orchard had to be narrowed down further. To do research, I had to find myself a niche within biochemistry, so I began work on nucleic acids ...

And at about that point, I rebelled! I could not stand the claustrophobia that clamped down upon me. I looked with horror, backward and forward across the years, at a horizon that was narrowing down and narrowing down to so petty a portion of the orchard. What I wanted was all the orchard, or as much of it as I could cover in a lifetime of running ...

I have never been sorry for my stubborn advance toward generalization. To be sure, I can't wander in detail through all the orchard, any more than anyone else can, no matter how stupidly determined I may be to do so. Life is far too short and the mind is far too limited. But I can float over the orchard as in a balloon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|last=Christian|first=James L.|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''James Alfred Ford''' was an American archaeologist. He was born in [[Water Valley, Mississippi]], on February 12, 1911. He became interested in work on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Mound builder (people)|mound]] research while growing up in [[Mississippi]].

==Archaeological work==
In 1933 Ford build a tentative chronology of the cultures on the lower Mississippi River.&lt;ref name=gibson2&gt;Jon Gibson: The Ancient Mounds of Poverty Point. University of Florida Press, Gainesville et al, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8130-1833-1}}, Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1933 and 1934, he worked at the [[Ocmulgee National Monument]] in [[Macon, Georgia]], under [[Arthur Randolph Kelly]]. Also in 1934, he investigated the [[Tabby]] ruins at Elizafield Plantation near [[Brunswick, Georgia]]. From August 1 to September 1, 1934, he worked for the Georgia State Parks Service; and later that year, from September 2 to October 15, he worked for the Southeast Fair Association to develop an American Indian Exhibition in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. In 1937, he became involved in a restoration project of an [[Earth lodge|earthen lodge]] at Ocmulgee National Monument for the [[National Park Service]]. In the winter of 1939-40 he excavated the [[Medora Site]] for the [[Louisiana State Archaeological Survey]], a joint project of [[Louisiana State University]] and the [[Work Projects Administration]]. The excavations of the site were instrumental in defining the characteristics of the [[Plaquemine culture]] and period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Quimby, George Irving|title=ANTHROPOLOGICAL SERIES, FIELD MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, VOLUME XXIV, NUMBER 2|article=THE MEDORA SITE of WEST BATON ROUGE PARISH, LOUISIANA |publisher=Chicago Field Museum Press|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1950s he led the first large scale excavations at [[Poverty Point]], Louisiana; a project that took him with breaks until his death. He discovered the ridge structure of the precolumbian earthworks as the unique features of that site. His experiments with [[loess]] soil to find the purpose of the hundreds of thousands ''Poverty Point objects'' were the beginnings of [[experimental archaeology]] in North America. His theories over the origin of the [[Poverty Point culture]] later became obsolete, his samples and results of [[radiocarbon dating]] were inaccurate due to the very early stages of that technology.&lt;ref name=gibson2 /&gt; In 1958 he excavated the [[Menard-Hodges Site]] in southeastern [[Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uark.edu/campus-resources/archinfo/atufrencol.html|title=UA-WRI-French Colonial Arkansas|accessdate=2009-12-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805231740/http://www.uark.edu/campus-resources/archinfo/atufrencol.html|archivedate=2012-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dh Comet.jpg|thumb|300x300px|The [[de Havilland Comet]] was the first commercial [[jet airliner]] and began service on 9 January 1951.]]
The '''Jet Age''' is a period in the [[history of aviation]] defined by the advent of aircraft powered by [[gas turbine|turbine]] engines, and by the social change this brought about.

[[Jet airliner]]s were able to fly much higher, faster, and farther than older [[piston engine|piston]]{{nbhyph}}powered [[propliner]]s, making transcontinental and intercontinental travel considerably faster and easier: for example, aircraft leaving North America and crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] (and later, the [[Pacific Ocean]]) could now fly to their destinations non-stop, making much of the world accessible within a single day's travel for the first time. Since large jetliners could also carry more passengers than piston-powered airliners, air fares also declined (relative to [[inflation]]), so people from a greater range of socioeconomic classes could afford to travel outside their own countries.

Besides the pure jet, the turbine driven propeller engines offered improvements of the piston engine delivering a smoother ride and better fuel efficiency.  One exception to jet-powered domination by large airliners was the [[contra-rotating propellers]] [[turboprop]] design that powered the [[Tu-114]] (first flight 1957). This airliner was able to match or even exceed the speed, capacity and range of contemporary jets; however, the use of such powerplants in large airframes was totally restricted to the military after 1976.

The introduction of the [[Concorde]] supersonic transport (SST) airliner to regular service in 1976 was expected to bring similar social changes, but the aircraft never found commercial success.  After two and a half decades of service, a [[Air France Flight 4590|fatal crash near Paris in July 2000]] and other factors eventually caused Concorde flights to be discontinued in 2003.  This was the only loss of an SST in civilian service. Only one other SST design was used in a civilian capacity, the Soviet era [[Tu-144]], but it was soon withdrawn due to high maintenance and other issues. [[McDonnell Douglas]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and [[Boeing]] were three U.S. manufacturers that had originally planned to develop various SST designs since the 1960s, but these projects were eventually abandoned for various developmental, cost, and other practical reasons.

==Origins==
The term "Jet Age" was coined in the late 1940s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014|reason=unsourced claim}} At the time, the only jet-powered aircraft in production were military types, most of which were fighters. The expression reflects the recognition that the jet engine had effected, or would soon, a profound change in aeronautics and aviation.

One view is that the jet age began with the invention of the jet engine in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210191/history-of-flight/260590/The-jet-age "The jet age," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the history of military aviation it began in 1944 with the introduction into service of the [[Arado Ar 234]] reconnaissance bomber and the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] fighter during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/382295/military-aircraft/57508/The-jet-age#toc57509 "Military Aircraft," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Green, W.; "Warplanes of the Third Reich", Macdonald and Jane's (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; In commercial aviation the jet age was introduced to Britain in 1952 with the first scheduled flight of the [[de Havilland Comet]] airliner and to America some years later with the first American-built jet airliners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/features/jet-age/ "Sixty years of the jet age," ''Flight Global'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Jet Age, 1958 – today," ''America by air'', Smithsonian national Air and Space Museum.[http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/america-by-air/online/jetage/jetage02.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil aviation==
The British [[de Havilland Comet]] was the first jet airliner to fly (1949), the first in service (1952), and the first to offer a regular transatlantic service (1958). One hundred and fourteen of all versions were built. However, the first jet airliner to provide a sustained and dependable service was the Soviet [[Tupolev Tu-104]] (201 built) which was the only jet airliner in operation worldwide between 1956 and 1958 (the Comet having been withdrawn in 1954 due to structural failure issues). The Comet and Tu-104 were later outstripped in production by the American [[Boeing 707]] (which entered service in 1958) and [[Douglas DC-8]], which joined it in the skies over the next few years. Other types of the period included the French [[Sud Aviation Caravelle]].

When the [[Boeing 707]] began service on the [[New York City|New York]] to [[London]] route in 1958, this became the first year that more trans-Atlantic passengers traveled by air than by ship.

As the number of passengers soared, it became impractical to increase the number of aircraft flying from the major [[Airline hub|hub airports]]. Instead, designers created even larger [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody airliners]] and the engine manufacturers responded with larger, more powerful and also more fuel-efficient engines. The first "jumbo jet" was the [[Boeing 747]], and it both increased airport passenger capacity and reduced the cost of air travel, further accelerating the social changes brought about by the Jet Age.

==Military aviation==
Military aviation had entered the jet age somewhat earlier, during the closing stages of World War II. In the early postwar years, the increasing use of jet aircraft had little significant impact, serving mainly to continue the slow but steady improvements in performance seen in the past. Supersonic flight brought about a step change in aircraft performance. The [[Bell X-1]], first to break the sound barrier in level flight, was an experimental rocket-powered type, and production jets which followed it into service could fly little faster. The first jet aircraft designed from the outset for supersonic flight was the British [[Fairey Delta 2]]. On March 10, 1956 it became the first aircraft to fly faster than 1,000 miles per hour, heralding an era of "fast jets" typically limited to a speed of Mach 2.2 by the engineering materials available. As jets became faster, their armament changed from guns to missiles. Avionics systems became more complex with radar, fire-control and other systems. Aircraft became larger and more expensive, and so were required to do more to make them economical. All this profoundly affected the nature of military strategy during the [[cold war|Cold War]].

'''Joseph Biner''' (1697, [[Gluringen]], Switzerland&amp;mdash;March 24, 1766, [[Torrenburg]], Germany) was a Roman Catholic [[canon law|canonist]], historian, and theologian. His fame rests principally on his [[erudition]] abilities.

==Biography==
Biner entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in 1715 and received the usual training of its members. He was later professor of [[canon law]] in the universities of [[University of Ingolstadt|Ingolstadt]], [[University of Dillingen|Dillingen]] and [[University of Innsbruck|Innsbruck]]. He entered zealously into all the controversies with the sectaries of his time, especially with the Swiss Protestants. As a consequence, all his works have a polemical tinge.

In 1739 appeared his ''Catholische Anmerkung über die neueste uncatholische Controvers-Schreiber'', directed against certain opponents in [[Zürich]]. This was followed in 1744 by ''Indifferentismus'', a treatise on religious indifference and liberalism in dogmatic teaching. Biner published ''Heiligkeit der Kirche'' in 1750, discussing the marks of the "true Church" and giving sketches of eminent Catholics. The best of his polemical works is ''De Summâ Trinitate, Fide Catholicâ et Hierarchiâ Ecclesiasticâ''. It appeared in 1765 and shows him at his best as a theologian and canonist. His last controversial treatise, which appeared the same year and was published like all the others at Vienna, is entitled: ''Kurzer Begriff der heutigen Glaubenstreitigkeiten''. It is an examination and refutation of various Protestant confessions of faith.

Biner's chief work of a purely canonical character is ''Dissertationes juridicæ de beneficiis ecclesiasticis'' (Innsbruck, 1746). His masterpiece is the ''Apparatus erudictionis ad jurisprudentiam ecclesiasticam''. The work, despite its title, is not restricted to canon law, but is also historical, polemical, and theological. It was published at Vienna in eight quarto volumes from 1754 to 1766. It is a work of vast erudition and a storehouse of history and canon law. Dividing his material by centuries, Biner treats of the various species of law, of the history of the church councils, of the political and religious vicissitudes of the various nations, of treaties and concordats, etc. Interspersed in the work are many valuable excursuses on [[Jansenism]], [[Probabilism]], Public Penance, Origin of Imperial Electors, etc. However the work is rendered less valuable for students by a nonsystematic arrangement of material and the want of an index. The vastness of the knowledge which Biner displays, however, has received praise even from his opponents. He wrote many other works besides those mentioned, which may be found in De Backer and Sommervogel, cited below.

'''Lobsang Rampa''' is the pen name of an author who wrote books with [[paranormal]] and [[occult]] themes. His best known work is ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'', published in Britain in 1956.

Following the publication of the book, newspapers reported that Rampa was '''Cyril Henry Hoskin''' (8 April 1910&amp;nbsp;– 25 January 1981), a plumber from [[Plympton]] in [[Devon]] who claimed that his body hosted the spirit of a Tibetan [[lama]] going by the name of '''Tuesday Lobsang Rampa''', who is purported to have authored the books. The name Tuesday relates to a claim in ''The Third Eye'' that Tibetans are named after the day of the week on which they were born.

==''The Third Eye''==
In November 1956 a book called ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'' was published in the United Kingdom. It was written by a man named Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, and it purported to relate his experiences while growing up in Chakpori Lamasery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]] |last= Rampa |first= Lobsang |publisher= Secker &amp; Warburg |year= 1956 |isbn= 9780345340382 |chapter= Chapter 4: At The Temple Gates |ref= {{Harvid|Rampa|1956}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chokpori]], Tibet, after being sent there at the age of seven. The title of the book is derived from an operation, similar to [[trepanation]], that Rampa claimed he had undergone, in which a small hole was drilled into his forehead to arouse the [[third eye]] and enhance powers of [[clairvoyance]]. The book describes the operation as follows:

{{quote|The instrument penetrated the bone. A very hard, clean sliver of wood had been treated by fire and herbs and was slid down so that it just entered the hole in my head. I felt a stinging, tickling sensation apparently in the bridge of my nose. It subsided and I became aware of subtle scents which I could not identify. Suddenly there was a blinding flash. For a moment the pain was intense. It diminished, died and was replaced by spirals of colour. As the projecting sliver was being bound into place so that it could not move, the Lama Mingyar Dondup turned to me and said: "You are now one of us, Lobsang. For the rest of your life you will see people as they are and not as they pretend to be."}}

During the story, Rampa sees [[yeti]]s and eventually encounters a [[mummy|mummified]] body of himself from an earlier [[incarnation]]. He also takes part in an initiation ceremony in which he learns that during its early history the Earth was struck by [[Giant impact hypothesis#Theia|another planet]], causing Tibet to become the mountain kingdom that it is today.

The manuscript of ''The Third Eye'' had been turned down by several leading British publishers before being accepted by [[Secker and Warburg]] for an advance of £800 (£{{Inflation|UK|800|1956|r=-3|fmt=c}} today). [[Fredric Warburg]] of Secker and Warburg had met the book's author, who at the time appeared in the guise of "Doctor Carl Kuon Suo".  Intrigued by the writer's personality, Warburg sent the manuscript to a number of scholars, several of whom expressed doubts about its authenticity. Nevertheless, the book was published in November 1956 and soon became a global bestseller. The ''[[The Times|Times Literary Supplement]]'' said of the book: "It came near to being a work of art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://i.imgur.com/kOuwPnY.jpg |title= T. Lobsang Rampa |newspaper= [[The Times]] |date= 31 January 1981 |accessdate= 23 December 2013 |type= obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over authorship===
[[Image:thirdeye.jpg|thumb|right|Original 1950s cover of ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'']]
Explorer and Tibetologist [[Heinrich Harrer]] was unconvinced about the book's origins and hired a private detective from [[Liverpool]] named Clifford Burgess to investigate Rampa. "In January 1957, Scotland Yard asked him to present a Tibetan passport or a residence permit. Rampa moved to Ireland. One year later, the scholars retained the services of Clifford Burgess, a leading Liverpool private detective. Burgess’s report, when it came in, was terse. Lama Lobsang Rampa of Tibet, he determined after one month of inquiries, was none other than Cyril Henry Hoskin, a native of Plympton, Devonshire, the son of the village plumber and a high school dropout."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/lobsang-rampa-mystery-three-eyed-lama/|title=Lobsang Rampa: The Mystery of the Three-Eyed Lama|last=Jr.|first=Donald S.

Lopez Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of Burgess' investigation were published in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in February 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=mjUHF7kQfVAC&amp;pg=PA101 Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West]'', University of Chicago Press, 1999, 294 pages, p.99-100: "Pallis, acting on behalf of a group of European experts on Tibet, retained the services of Clifford Burgess, a leading Liverpool private detective, in an effort to discover the true identity of T. Lobsabng Rampa. By the end of the month and three thousand miles of travel, Burgess had produced the following report: CYRIL HENRY HOSKIN - BIOGRAPHICAL DETAILS [...] the February 3 Daily Express ran the headline "The FULL truth about the Bogus Lama."&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that the author of the book was a man named Cyril Henry Hoskin, who had been born in [[Plympton]], Devon, in 1910 and was the son of a [[plumber]]. Hoskin had never been to Tibet and spoke no Tibetan. In 1948, he had legally changed his name to Carl Kuon Suo before adopting the name Lobsang Rampa.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez, ''Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West]'', op. cit., p.101.&lt;/ref&gt; An obituary of [[Fra Andrew Bertie]], Grand Master of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]], claims that he was involved in unmasking Lobsang Rampa as a West Country plumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article2080924.ece |title= Fra Andrew Bertie  |newspaper= [[The Times]] |date= 23 February 2008 |type= obituary |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rampa was tracked by the British press to [[Howth]], Ireland, and confronted with these allegations. He did not deny that he had been born as Cyril Hoskin, but claimed that his body was now occupied by the [[spirit]] of Lobsang Rampa.&lt;ref&gt;Agehananda Bharati (aka Leopold Fischer), Fictitious Tibet: the Origin and Persistence of Rampaism, in ''Tibet Society Bulletin'', Vol. 7, 1974: "Hoskin had a ready explanation for his predicament: yes, he had indeed been born Cyril Henry Hoskin. That good gentleman’s soul, however, had long since fled its corporeal form, so that the soul of a Tibetan lama, namely Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, could move in."&lt;/ref&gt; According to the account given in his third book, ''The Rampa Story'', he had fallen out of a [[fir]] tree in his garden in [[Thames Ditton]], Surrey, while attempting to photograph an [[owl]]. He was concussed and, on regaining his senses, had seen a Buddhist monk in saffron robes walking towards him. The monk spoke to him about Rampa taking over his body and Hoskin agreed, saying that he was dissatisfied with his current life. When Rampa's original body became too worn out to continue, he took over Hoskin's body in a process of [[transmigration of the soul]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 8, ''The Rampa Story''. Rampa says that this incident occurred at a house called Rose Croft in [[Thames Ditton]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Rampa maintained for the rest of his life that ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'' was a true story. In the foreword to the 1964 edition of the book, he wrote:
{{quote|I am Tuesday Lobsang Rampa, that is my only name, now my legal name, and I answer to no other.}}

To [[Donald S. Lopez, Jr.]], an American Tibetologist, the books of Lobsang Rampa are "the works of an unemployed surgical fitter, the son of a plumber, seeking to support himself as a ghostwriter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first= Donald S., Jr. |last= Lopez |authorlink= Donald S. Lopez, Jr. |title= Prisoners of Shangri-La: Tibetan Buddhism and the West |publisher= University of Chicago Press |year= 1998 |page= 112 |ref= {{Harvid|Lopez|1998}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authorship controversy was dramatised in a radio play, ''The Third Eye and the Private Eye'', by David Lemon and Mark Ecclestone, first broadcast by [[BBC Radio 4]] in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/archive.php The Third Eye and the Private Eye] BBC Radio 4. Retrieved 29 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence on Tibetologists’ callings===
Donald S. Lopez, Jr., in ''Prisoners of Shangri-La'' (1998), points out that when discussing Rampa with other tibetologists and buddhologists in Europe, he found that ''[[The Third Eye (book)|The Third Eye]]'' was the first book many of them had read about Tibet: "For some it was a fascination with the world Rampa described that had led them to become professional scholars of Tibet."

Lopez adds that when he gave ''The Third Eye'' to a class of his at the University of Michigan without telling them about its history, the "students were unanimous in their praise of the book, and despite six prior weeks of lectures and readings on Tibetan history and religion, [...] they found it entirely credible and compelling, judging it more realistic than anything they had previously read about Tibet."{{sfn|Lopez|1998|pp= 104, 112}}

== Role in the Tibetan cause ==
Lobsang Rampa was a supporter of the Tibetan cause despite criticism of his books. In 1972, Rampa's French language agent Alain Stanké wrote to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] and asked for his opinion about Rampa's identity. He received a reply from the Dalai Lama's deputy secretary stating "I wish to inform you that we do not place credence in the books written by the so-called Dr. T. Lobsang Rampa. His works are highly imaginative and fictional in nature." The Dalai Lama had previously admitted that although the books were fictitious, they had created good publicity for Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= T. Lobsang Rampa: New Age Trailblazer |last= Mutton |first= Karen |publisher= TGS Publishing |year= 2006 |pages= [https://www.box.com/s/n7bxpreatecy4vkgqjlm 166–7] |isbn= 9780971316607 |ref= {{Harvid|Mutton|2006}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
Lobsang Rampa went on to write another 18 books containing a mixture of religious and [[occult]] material. One of the books, ''Living with the Lama'', was described as being dictated to Rampa by his pet [[Siamese cat]], Mrs. Fifi Greywhiskers. Faced with repeated accusations from the British press that he was a [[charlatan]] and a [[con artist]], Rampa went to live in Canada in the 1960s. He and his wife, San Ra'ab, became Canadian citizens in 1973, along with Sheelagh Rouse (Buttercup) who was his secretary and regarded by Rampa as his adopted daughter.

Lobsang Rampa died in [[Calgary]] on 25 January 1981, at the age of 70.

'''Maria Dorota Leopoldyna Czapska''' (6 February 1894 – 11 June 1981) was a [[Poland|Polish]] author, essayist, and historian. She was born in [[Prague]] to Count Jerzy Hutten-Czapski (1861-1930), and Jozefina Thun-Hohenstein (1867-1903), and grew up in Przyłuki, the family estate near [[Minsk]]. Her younger brother was [[Józef Czapski]], and her relatives included Counts [[Emeryk Hutten-Czapski]], [[Emeryk August Hutten-Czapski]], and [[Karol Hutten-Czapski]].&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polskieradio.pl/39/156/Artykul/1147974,Maria-Czapska-obywatelka-Europy|title=Maria Czapska - obywatelka Europy|publisher=polskieradio.pl|date=6 June 2014|accessdate=5 November 2017}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czapska studied in [[Krakow]] from 1921 to 1925, and moved to [[Paris]] afterwards, spending the next five years there writing a biography of [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. The biography, ''La vie de Mickiewicz'', published in 1931, was used for a time as a source in establishing Mickiewicz's ethnicity and origin, which remains under speculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historia.org.pl/2009/11/30/adam-mickiewicz-jako-mysliciel-religijny-i-spoleczny/|title=Adam Mickiewicz jako myśliciel religijny i społeczny|publisher=Historia.org.pl|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=5 November 2017}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 she published her second work, ''Ludwik Śniadecka'', and received the literary prize "Wiadomości Literackich" for her efforts the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Odznaczenie uczonego polskiego|publisher=Gazeta Lwowska|page=25|date=1 February 1939}} {{pl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Czapska lived in Poland, and was a member of the [[Żegota]] during this time; this led to her crossing the [[Inner German border|green border]] and moving to France in 1945, where she lived the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Literatura polska|editor=Sławomir Żurawski|publisher=Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN|year=2007|page=125|isbn=9788301151300}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short time, Czapska helped with the startup of [[Tygodnik Powszechny]], and after moving to France she worked on [[Kultura]], a Polish exile magazine. She was also a member of [[Polish Society of Arts and Sciences Abroad]]. During her time in exile, her works were subject to [[Censorship in the Polish People's Republic|censorship]], which was discovered after [[Tomasz Strzyżewski]] defected to Sweden, publishing the information which noted her name among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Zarys historii Polskiego Towarzystwa Naukowego na Obczyźnie|first=Stanisław|last=Portalski|year=2009|publisher=PTNO|isbn=9781870027472}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in life, she focused on literary works, namely ''Dwugłos wspomnień'', ''Europa w rodzinie'', and ''Czas odmieniony''.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;  In 2014 two of her books, ''A Family of Central Europe'' and ''Through the Storm'' were published in one book for the first time in english.

'''The Mariners' Museum and Park''' is located in [[Newport News, Virginia]], [[United States]]. Designated as America’s ''National Maritime Museum'' by [[United States Congress|Congress]], it is one of the largest [[maritime museum]]s in North America. '''The Mariners' Museum Library''', contains the largest [[maritime history]] collection in the [[Western Hemisphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marinersmuseum.org/library/ Museum Library], Mariners' Museum. Accessed 29 Sept 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The museum was founded in 1930 by [[Archer M. Huntington|Archer Milton Huntington]], son of [[Collis P. Huntington]], a railroad builder who brought the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] to [[Warwick County, Virginia]], and who founded the City of Newport News, its [[coal]] export facilities, and [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] in the late 19th century.

Huntington and his wife, the sculptor [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], acquired {{convert|800|acre}} of land that would come to hold {{convert|90000|sqft}} of exhibition galleries, a research library, a {{convert|167|acre|sing=on}} lake, a {{convert|5|mi|sing=on}} shoreline trail with fourteen bridges, and over 35,000 maritime artifacts from around the globe. After the land acquisition took place, the first two years were devoted to creating and improving a natural park and constructing a dam to create [[Lake Maury]], named after the nineteenth-century Virginia [[oceanographer]], Commodore [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]].

== Artifacts, paintings, models ==
The museum’s collection totals approximately 32,000 artifacts, equally divided between works of art and three-dimensional objects. The scope of the collection is international and includes miniature ship models, [[scrimshaw]], maritime paintings, decorative arts, carved [[Figurehead (object)|figureheads]], working [[steam engines]], and the world's only known existing Kratz-built [[Calliope (music)|steam calliope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum History |url=http://www.marinersmuseum.org/visitor-information/museum-history|publisher=Mariners' Museum|accessdate=27 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum holds important collections of paintings and drawings by marine artists [[James Bard]] and [[Antonio Jacobsen]].&lt;ref&gt;Mariner's Museum and Peluso, Anthony J., Jr., ''The Bard Brothers -- Painting America under Steam and Sail'', Abrams, New York 1997 {{ISBN|0-8109-1240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum offers educational programs for all ages, a large research library and archives, as well as publications and Internet resources for teachers.

The largest boat in its collection is the ''[[Oracle Team USA 17]]'', the yacht that won the [[2013 America's Cup]].&lt;ref name="Speed and Innovation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Speed and Innovation|url=http://www.marinersmuseum.org/speed-and-innovation/|website=The Mariner's Museum and Park:|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== USS ''Monitor'' Center ==
[[Image:Marineers Museum Monitor.jpg|thumb|right|New replica of USS ''Monitor'', dedicated March 9th, 2007]]
The Mariners' Museum is home to the USS ''Monitor'' Center. In 1973, the wreck of the ironclad [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']], made famous in the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] in 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], was located on the floor of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] about 16 miles southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Dinsmore1999&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dinsmore, David A |author2=Broadwater, John D |title=1998 NOAA Research Expedition to the Monitor National Marine Sanctuary. |journal=In: Hamilton RW, Pence DF, Kesling DE, eds.

''Monitor'' Sanctuary is the only one of the thirteen national marine sanctuaries created to protect a cultural resource, rather than a natural resource or a mix of natural and cultural resources.&lt;ref name=Dinsmore1999/&gt;

The [[Monitor National Marine Sanctuary]] is now under the supervision of the U.S. [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]].&lt;ref name=Dinsmore1999/&gt;  Many artifacts from ''Monitor'', including her innovative [[turret]], propeller, anchor, engine and some personal effects of the crew, have been brought to the museum. For several years, they were conserved in special tanks to stabilize the metal. The new USS ''Monitor'' Center officially opened on March 9, 2007, and a full-scale replica of the ''Monitor'', the original recovered turret, and many artifacts and related items are now on display.&lt;ref name=dp2007a&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ericson, Mark St. John |date=2007-03-09 |title=The center opens |journal=[[Daily Press (Virginia)]] |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-monitoropening-m09,0,3701088.story |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dp2007b&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ericson, Mark St. John |date=2007-02-26 |title=Part 3: Replicating the mighty turret |journal=[[Daily Press (Virginia)]] |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-monitorreplica,0,7193973.story |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current efforts are focused on restoring the engine.&lt;ref name=LAT2010&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ericson, Mark St. John |date=2010-12-18 |title=Restoration efforts on Civil War steam engine progressing |journal=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/dec/18/nation/la-na-monitor-engine-20101219 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Park and Noland Trail==
[[Image:Sunset_On_Lions_Bridge_Newport_News_VA.jpg|thumb|right|Sunset on the James, as seen from the Lions Bridge]]
The Mariners' Museum Park is 550 acres of privately maintained, naturally wooded property that offers visitors a quiet and serene place to walk, run, or picnic. Within the Park is the 167-acre [[Lake Maury]], named for the famed 19th-century oceanographer and native Virginian, Matthew Fontaine Maury.

Following the shoreline of Lake Maury is the five-mile Noland Trail. Dedicated as a gift from the Noland Family in 1991 and with significant ongoing financial support from the Noland Family, the trail has fourteen bridges, picnic areas, benches, handicap access, and mile markers. Each fall The Mariners' Museum hosts a 10K run on the Noland Trail.

The Mariners’ Museum Park is open daily to the public. Benches at approximately every half-mile offer places of rest along the trail, and views of Lake Maury can be found around every corner.

The famous Lions Bridge, a dam that provides a scenic view of the James River, remains a highlight for visitors—a perfect family gathering place to enjoy the Museum Park. The beauty of the dam is enhanced by several fine pieces of statuary designed by Anna Hyatt Huntington, sculptor and wife of Museum founder Archer Milton Huntington. Four stone lions were mounted on the ends of the parapets of the dam in October 1932. Anna also created and dedicated a monument entitled ''Conquering the Wild'' that overlooks the Lions Bridge, the park, and Lake Maury.

There are numerous memorials to King in the United States, including:

* [[Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial]] on the [[National Mall]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Washington, DC Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation Breaks Ground On Historic $100 Million Memorial On The National Mall In Washington, D.C.|date=November 6, 2006|accessdate=August 27, 2008|publisher=Washington, DC Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Project Foundation|url=http://www.mlkmemorial.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=hkIUL9MVJxE&amp;b=1601407&amp;ct=3612187|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616170228/http://www.mlkmemorial.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=hkIUL9MVJxE&amp;b=1601407&amp;ct=3612187|archivedate=June 16, 2012}}

The Special Air Service (SAS), along with men from the Special Boat Squadron (SBS), attempted to carry out a diversionary amphibious raid on Port [[Stanley Harbour]] on the night of 13–14 June 1982. The plan was, as 2 PARA attacked Wireless Ridge, 4 [[Rigid Raider]] fast landing crafts (steered by Sergeant Buckle, Lance-Corporal Gilbert and Marines Kavanagh and Nordic) and carrying SAS soldiers (some 30 men from D Squadron) and SBS reinforcements (6 men from 3 section) would travel across the harbour and attack the oil storage facilities on Cortley Ridge.

==Incursion==

The British commando force was spotted by a National Gendarmerie Special Forces officer aboard the Argentine hospital ship ''Almirante Irízar'' (preparing to collect Major José Ricardo Spadaro's 601 National Gendarmerie Special Forces Squadron on Navy Point&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmalvinense.com/smalvi/0109/1099.html Gendarmería en Malvinas: Alacrán, un Escuadrón con justa gloria]&lt;/ref&gt; in order to insert them behind British lines on Beagle Ridge), before it could reach the fuel tanks.&lt;ref&gt;"Next night, they met up with the Special Forces at Blanco Bay and then, with nine soldiers to each Rigid Raider, they sped across Port William Bay, but had the misfortune to be heard by a Border Guard commando collecting supplies on board the Almirante Irízar for an Argentine special forces infiltration operation en route to Beagle Ridge to raid and direct air and 155mm artillery fire on the British rear." Nine Battles to Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, p. 211, Pen &amp; Sword Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; A massive volume of fire, including 8 Hispano-Suiza 30mm anti-aircraft guns from 101 Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment's B Battery (under Major Jorge Alberto Monge) was concentrated on the SAS/SBS raiders from positions along Cortley Ridge. Nevertheless, most of the raiders landed but heavy fire from Lieutenant Héctor Gazzolo's 3rd Marine Platoon&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aposmalvinas.com.ar/hist002.htm La Sección Marinería en Camber ]&lt;/ref&gt; prevented exploitation from the narrow beach,&lt;ref&gt;"Most of the raiding party landed but heavy fire from the defending marines prevented exploitation from the narrow beach." Nine Battles to Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl,  Pen &amp; Sword Books, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; causing the SAS/SBS force to withdraw. According to John Parker's book ''SBS: The Inside Story of The Special Boat Service'' (Hachette, 2013), the four Rigid Raiders were damaged beyond repair and three British Special Forces were wounded in the attack:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;A six-man team from 3 SBS ... with D and G Squadrons, SAS, with the object of creating a diversionary assault from the sea ... were to move across the Murrell River by four fast power-boats ... The raiders had no option but to withdraw. One of the RRCs was badly damaged and limped back on hardly any power. The coxswain steered her by the hospital-ship for a shield and the boat died on them just as they reached the water's edge. Another sanks just offshore, but close enough for the team to swim to safety ... An SBS corporal and two SAS troopers were wounded ... The RRCs were riddled with holes and had to be destroyed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==

The wisdom of this attack was later questioned in British circles as it was seen by some as a reckless operation with little strategic benefit. However, the shore bombardment and British raid in Stanley Harbour scrapped a major Argentine Special Forces operation and convinced the Argentine High Command into believing that a major landing was taking place that would bring the major buildings in Port Stanley within enemy small-arms fire. The Argentine Army Special Forces in Stanley, that were preparing with the Gendarmerie commandos for a major insertion behind British lines on Beagle Ridge, were instead sent aboard the Coast Guard ship ''Forrest'' to help Major Jorge Monge on Cortley Ridge and Spadaro on nearby Navy Point defend the anti-aircraft guns and round-up any SAS stragglers.&lt;ref&gt;"Los ingleses estarían allí a “tiro de honda” de la capital. La operación sobre Freycinet quedaba cancelada, pues las Compañías eran requeridas para rastrillar aquella lengua de tierra y proteger los cañones." Comandos en Acción, Isidoro Jorge Ruiz Moreno,  Emecé Editores, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

Rani ki Vav bagged the title of “Cleanest Iconic Place” in India at the Indian Sanitation Conference (INDOSAN) 2016 in New Delhi in October 2016. The monument was felicitated at the conference, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gujarat world heritage site: Rani ki Vav bags ‘Cleanest Iconic Place’ award|url = http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/gujarat-world-heritage-site-rani-ki-vav-bags-cleanest-iconic-place-award/|website =indianexpress.com|accessdate = 2016-10-25|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Rani ki vav1.jpg|thumb|250px|Inside Rani ki vav.]]
Rani ki vav, or '''Ran-ki vav''' (Queen’s step well) was constructed during the rule of the [[Chaulukya dynasty]]. It is generally assumed that it was built in the memory of [[Bhima I]] (r. c. 1022–1064) by his widowed queen Udayamati and probably completed by Udayamati and [[Karna (Chaulukya dynasty)|Karna]] after his death. A reference to Udayamati building the monument is in ''Prabandha Chintamani'', composed by the Jain monk Merunga Suri in 1304 AD.

The stepwell was later flooded by the nearby [[Saraswati River, Gujarat|Saraswati River]] and silted over until the late 1980s. When it was excavated by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], the carvings were found in pristine condition.

== Architecture ==
This magnificent east-facing step well measures approximately 64&amp;nbsp;m long, 20&amp;nbsp;m wide &amp; 27&amp;nbsp;m deep. A stepped corridor compartmented at regular intervals pillared multistory pavilions is a unique feature. It was one of the largest and the most sumptuous structures of its type. It became silted up and much of it is not visible now, except for some rows of sculptured panels in the circular part of the well. Among its ruins one pillar still stands which is an excellent example of this period of design. A part only of the west well is extant from which it appears that the wall had been built of brick and faced with stone. From this wall project vertical brackets in pairs, which supported the different galleries of the well shaft proper. The bracketing is arranged in tiers and is richly carved. The minute and exquisite carving of this vav is one of the finest specimens of its kind. Befitting its name, the ''Rani-Ki-Vav'' is now considered to be the queen among step wells of India.

There is also a small gate below the last step of the step well, with a 30-kilometre tunnel, currently blocked by stones and mud, which leads to the town of [[Sidhpur]] near Patan. It was used as an escape gateway for the king, who built the step well in the times of defeat.

=== Ornate side walls ===
[[File:Rani ki Vav Vishnu.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Vishnu sculpture inside Rani ki Vav]]
[[File:Rani ki vav 08.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Carved pillars inside Rani ki Vav]]
Most of the sculptures are in devotion to [[Vishnu]], in the forms of Dus-Avatars [[Kalki]], [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Narsinh]], [[Vaman]], [[Varahi]] and others representing their return to the world. ''Nagkanya'', ''Yogini'' beautiful women – ''Apsara'' showcasing 16 different styles of make-up to look more attractive called ''Solah-shringar''.

Around 50–60 years back there were [[ayurvedic]] plants around this area, and the water accumulated in Rani ki vav was considered to be helpful for viral disease, fever etc.

The vavs of Gujarat are not merely sites for collecting water and socializing, but also hold great spiritual significance. Originally, the vavs of Gujarat were constructed quite simply, but became more intricate over the years, perhaps to make explicit the ancient concept of the sanctity of water with the addition of carved stone deities. Thus visitors enter Rani Ki Vav as if it is an inverted temple, where one steps down various levels to the water.

The steps begin at ground level, leading you down through the cool air through several pillared pavilions to reach the deep well below. There are more than 800 elaborate sculptures among seven galleries. The central theme is the [[Dashavatara|Dasavataras]], or ten incarnations of Vishnu, including [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. The avatars are accompanied by [[sadhu]]s, [[Brahmin]]s, and [[apsaras]] (celestial dancers), painting their lips and adorning themselves. At water level you come to a carving of Sheshashayi-Vishnu, in which Vishnu reclines on the thousand-hooded serpent [[Shesha]], where it is said he rests in the infinity between ages.

He was a strong critic of democracy, denouncing the trust it placed in ignorant masses.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, ''Las Derechas'', p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the main developers of the belief within Argentine nationalist thought that [[liberalism]] was merely a prelude to [[communism]], arguing that "democracy hands us over unarmed to these forces of extreme [[socialism]] and [[anarchy]]".&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell, ''The Cambridge History of Latin America'', Cambridge University Press, 1991, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote widely for ''La Fronda'', a conservative nationalist journal.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1"&gt;Deutsch, ''Las Derechas'', pp. 197-198&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of the nationalist leaders de Laferrère was an academic and in 1938 he joined the likes of the Irazusta brothers, [[Carlos Ibarguren]], [[Manuel Gálvez]] and [[Ernesto Palacio (writer)|Ernesto Palacio]] in establishing the ''Instituto Juan Manuel de Rosas''. The ''Instituto'' soon became a centre for the publication of highly conservative scholarship in which [[historical revisionism]] about Argentina's past loomed large.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liga Republicana==
Along with [[Rodolfo Irazusta]] he established the ''[[Republican League (Argentina)|Liga Republicana]]'' youth movement around 1927, the aim of which was to undermine the government.&lt;ref name="Deutsch1"/&gt; The group was united by the members hatred of [[Hipólito Yrigoyen]] although significant elements within the ''Liga'' were inspired by the [[fascism]] of [[Benito Mussolini]] as well as the ideas of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera, 2nd Marquis of Estella]].&lt;ref name="Deutsch2"&gt;Sandra McGee Deutsch, [http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/sandra-mcgee-deutsch/social-origins-of-counterrevolution-in-argentina-1900-1932-tue/page-18-social-origins-of-counterrevolution-in-argentina-1900-1932-tue.shtml Social origins of counterrevolution in Argentina, 1900-1932.]&lt;/ref&gt; De Laferrère was insistent that the ''Liga'' should not become a political party and he clashed with Irazusta over the issue when the latter suggested presenting a list for the [[Argentine legislative election, 1930|1930 election]]. De Laferrère and [[Juan Carulla]]'s idea, that the ''Liga'' should support the Independent Socialists, was endorsed and Irazusta resigned from the movement.&lt;ref name="Deutsch2"/&gt;

Following the establishment of the [[Argentine Civic Legion]] in 1931 Laferrère began to wane in his support for [[José Félix Uriburu]] and eventually withdrew his ''Liga Republicana'' from the movement, citing the "lumpen" nature of what was approaching a mass movement, as well as it ties to mainstream conservatism. As a consequence of de Laferrère's split other nationalist intellectuals followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, ''Las Derechas'', pp. 200-201&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
Like many of his nationalist colleagues de Laferrère had a strong strain of [[anti-Americanism]] in his thought and this increased during the [[Second World War]]. He argued in 1941 that Argentina should adopt a neutral position and should instead concentrate on strengthening its own army in order to ensure it could defend itself rather than spending on supporting the American war effort. His views influenced [[Enrique Ruiz Guiñazú]], who had been appointed as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship|Foreign Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite his own [[anti-Semitism]], de Laferrère was not a supporter of [[Nazism]] and rather endorsed an isolationist policy for Argentina. Suspicious of all overseas powers, with the exception of France which he declared his support for in 1939, he argued in early 1941 that "today our worst enemies are the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Jews]]. Tomorrow they could be the [[United States|Yanks]] or the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[anti-British sentiment]] was a common feature of nationalist rhetoric in Argentina, deriving in part from the issue's surrounding the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute]] as well what the nationalists portrayed as a history of mistreatment at the hands of Britain through a series of loans with very high interest rates after independence, British involvement in the independence of [[Uruguay]] and the settling of her borders at the expense of Argentina and a form of commercial imperialism that de Laferrère felt had caused the [[Argentine Civil Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some of his fellow nationalists de Laferrère was not an enthusiastic supporter of [[Juan Perón]] and he scoffed at what he saw as Perón's cowardice when he was ousted from the Presidency in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, ''Authoritarian Argentina'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Samuel A'Court Ashe''' (September 13, 1840 &amp;ndash; 1938) was a [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] [[infantry]] [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] in the [[American Civil War]] and celebrated editor, historian, and [[North Carolina]] legislator.  Prior to his death in 1938, he was the last surviving [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] of the Confederate States Army. Samuel's father, [[William Shepperd Ashe]] (1814–1862), served in the North Carolina state senate and [[United States]] [[United States Congress|Congressman]]. The [[United Confederate Veterans]] conferred the title of [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] upon Samuel A. Ashe in 1936 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]]. Ashe is also noted for his booklet on the war titled ''A Southern View of the Invasion of the Southern States and War of 1861-65.''

[[File:Samuel A'Court Ashe Monument.jpg|thumb|Samuel A'Court Ashe Memorial in Raleigh, NC]]
Born in [[Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina]], in 1840, Ashe grew up near [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]] and spent much of his life in [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]]. He attended the [[United States Naval Academy]] at [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], where he met future naval historian and lifelong friend [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]]. When the war erupted, Ashe enlisted in the Confederate Army and served for its duration, rising to the rank of captain. Among his duty assignments was serving at [[North Carolina Baptist Assembly|Fort Caswell]], on the eastern end of [[Oak Island, North Carolina|Oak Island]]. 

After the war, Samuel married Hannah Emerson Willard in 1871 and had nine children (one of whom was [[William Willard Ashe]], the noted [[Botany|botanist]] and associate of the [[United States Forest Service]]). Samuel studied [[law]] in Wilmington, later establishing a law practice there. Active in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Ashe worked for several government departments and ultimately served in the North Carolina House of Representatives. As a [[legislator]], Ashe revised North Carolina [[tax]] laws concerning the resolution of state [[debt]]s. 

Ashe became [[Copy editing|editor]] of the Raleigh Daily News, and subsequently purchased the Raleigh Daily Observer, merging the two to become editor of both publications. A prolific writer, he wrote many materials between the period of 1908 and 1935 on the subjects of North Carolina history, the Civil War, and the post-war [[Southern United States|South]]. Perhaps Captain Ashe's most renowned publication is his booklet on the war published in 1935 and titled ''A Southern View of the Invasion of the Southern States and War of 1861-65'', in which he addressed the subject of the [[constitutionality]] of the South's [[secession]] from the United States and other similar topics pertaining to the Confederacy, [[Abraham Lincoln]], and the war.

The contents of ''A Southern View...'' are as follows: (1) The Slave Trade; (2) Steps Leading to War; (3) Nullification, North and South; (4) The States Made the Union; (5) The Right of Secession; (6) Virginia's Ratification of the Constitution; (7) Motion of Thursday, the 26th of June, 1788; (8) Ratification by New York and Rhode Island; (9) Secession, Insurrection of the Negroes, and Northern Incendiarism; (10) The Modern Case of John Brown; (11) Why South Carolina Seceded; (12) Secession of the Cotton States; (13) President Lincoln's Inaugural; (14) Lincoln and the Constitution; (15) Lincoln, The Lawyer; (16) Lincoln, The Usurper; (17) Abraham Lincoln, The Citizen; (18) Lincoln as a Strategist; (19) Conditions Just After the War; (20) The War Between the Northern States and the Southern States; (21) The Patriotic Address of Jefferson Davis; (22) Postscript A Letter to a Boston Newspaper.

Ashe's [[monument]] denotes that he was "a [[Patriotism|patriot]], [[soldier]], [[historian]], legislator, editor, and [[Christian]] citizen."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42949">&lt;!-- {{Ancient Near East topics}} rem this until I figure out how to fix it --&gt;
The '''short chronology''' is one of the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronologies of the Near Eastern Bronze and Early Iron Age]], which fixes the reign of [[Hammurabi]] to 1728–1686 BC and the [[Babylonia#The sack of Babylon and ancient Near East chronology|sack of Babylon]] to 1531 BC.

The absolute [[2nd millennium BC]] dates resulting from this decision have very little support in academia, particularly after more recent research.  The ''[[middle chronology]]'' (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is commonly encountered in literature and early twenty-first century [[dendrochronology]] has essentially disproved the short chronology.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, S. W.; Kromer, B.; Kuniholm, P. I.; and Newton, M. W. 2001 Anatolian tree-rings and a new chronology for the east Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Ages. Science 294: 2532-35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0157144#pone-0157144-g008 Sturt W. Manning ''et al.'', Integrated Tree-Ring-Radiocarbon High-Resolution Timeframe to Resolve Earlier Second Millennium BCE Mesopotamian Chronology, PlosONE July 13 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; For much of the period in question, middle chronology dates can be calculated by adding 64 years to the corresponding short chronology date (e.g. 1728 BC in short chronology corresponds to 1792 in middle chronology).

After the so-called "dark age" between the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, absolute dating becomes less uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1619055/Problems_of_Chronology_Mesopotamia_Anatolia_and_the_Syro-Levantine_Region], Schwartz, Glenn, 2008.  "Problems of Chronology: Mesopotamia, Anatolia, and the Syro-Levantine Region." In Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade, and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C., edited by Joan Aruz, Kim Benzel, and Jean M. Evans: 450-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  While exact dates are still not agreed upon, the 64-year middle/short chronology dichotomy no longer applies from the beginning of the Third Babylon Dynasty onward.

==Early Bronze Age==
Estimation of absolute dates becomes possible for the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.
For the first half of the 3rd millennium, only very rough chronological matching of archaeological dates with written records is possible.

===Kings of Ebla===
{{Main|Ebla}}

The city-states of Ebla and [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] (in modern [[Syria]]) competed for power at this time. Eventually, under Irkab-Damu, Ebla defeated Mari for control of the region just in time to face the rise of [[Uruk]] and Akkad. After years of back and forth, Ebla was destroyed by the [[Akkadian Empire]]. Pottery seals of the [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Pepi I]] have been found in the wreckage of the city.

Since Akkad (or Agade), the capital of the [[Akkadian Empire]], has not yet been found, available chronological data comes from outlying locations like [[Ebla]], [[Tell Brak]], [[Nippur]], [[Susa]] and [[Tell Leilan]]. Clearly, the expansion of Akkad came under the rules of Sargon and Naram-sin. The last king of the empire, Shar-kali-sharri managed to mostly hold things together but upon his death, the empire fragmented. Finally, the city of Akkad itself was destroyed by the [[Guti (Mesopotamia)|Guti]].&lt;ref&gt;The Genesis and Collapse of Third Millennium North Mesopotamian Civilization, H.

First appearing in the area during the reign of [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] of [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]], the [[Gutium|Guti]] became a regional power after the decline of the [[Akkadian Empire]] following [[Shar-kali-sharri]]. The dynasty ends with the defeat of the last king, Tirigan, by [[Uruk]].

;Second Dynasty of Lagash
{{Further|Lagash}}

Following the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] after [[Shar-kali-sharri]] of Akkad under pressure from the invading Gutians, Lagash gradually regained prominence. As a client state to the Gutian Kings, Lagash was extremely successful, peaking under the rule of Gudea. After the last Gutian king, [[Tirigan]], was defeated, by [[Utu-hengal]], Lagash came under the control of Ur under [[Ur-Namma]].&lt;ref&gt;Gudea and His Dynasty, Dietz Otto Edzard, 1997, University of Toronto Press {{ISBN|0-8020-4187-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that there is some indication that the order of the last two rulers of Lagash should be reversed.

In an apparently peaceful transition, [[Ur]] came to power after the end of the reign of [[Utu-hengal]] of [[Uruk]], with the first king, Ur-Namma, solidifying his power with the defeat of [[Lagash]]. By the dynasty's end with the destruction of Ur by [[Elam]]ites and [[Shimashki]], the dynasty included little more than the area around Ur.&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Near East: C.3000-330 B.C.

After Ishbi-Erra of Isin breaks away from the declining [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] under [[Ibbi-Suen]], Isin reaches its peak under Ishme-Dagan.

;Kings of Larsa
{{Further|Larsa}}

The chronology of the Kingdom of Larsa is based mainly on the Larsa King List (Larsa Dynastic List), the Larsa Date Lists, and a number of royal inscriptions and commercial records. The Larsa King List was compiled in [[Babylon]] during the reign of [[Hammurabi]], conqueror of Larsa. It is suspected that the list elevated the first several [[Amorite]] [[Isin]]ite governors of Larsa to kingship so as to legitimize the rule of the Amorite Babylonians over Larsa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, Larsa briefly breaks free in a revolt ended by the death of the last king, Rim-Sin II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cuneiform.ucla.edu/staff/fitz/dissertation.pdf The Rulers of Larsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306091227/http://cuneiform.ucla.edu/staff/fitz/dissertation.pdf |date=2009-03-06 }}, M.

;First Babylonian Dynasty (Dynasty I)
{{Main|First Babylonian Dynasty}}

Following the fall of the Ur III Dynasty, the resultant power vacuum was contested by [[Isin]] and [[Larsa]], with Babylon and [[Assyria]] later joining the fray. In the second half of the reign of [[Hammurabi]], [[Babylon]] became the preeminent power, a position it largely maintained until the sack by [[Mursili I]] in 1531 BC. Note that there are no contemporary accounts of the sack of Babylon. It is inferred from much later documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/cg-cm/chronicles/abc20/kings.html Chronicle of early kings] at Livius.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations/historical%2fTelipinuProclamation.html The Proclamation of Telipinu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120816012134/http://www.hittites.info/translations.aspx?text=translations%2Fhistorical%2FTelipinuProclamation.html |date=2012-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;1st Sealand Dynasty (2nd Dynasty of Babylon)
{{Main|Sealand Dynasty}}

When the names of Sealand Dynasty kings were found on cuneiform records like the Babylonian Kings Lists, Chronicle 20, Chronicle of the Early Kings, and the Synchronistic King List, it was assumed that the dynasty slotted in between the [[First Dynasty of Babylon]] and the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Kirk Grayson, Assyrian and Babylonian chronicles, Eisenbrauns, 2000 {{ISBN|1-57506-049-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later discoveries changed this to the assumption that the dynasty ran entirely in parallel to the others. Modern scholarship has made it clear that the Sealand Dynasty did in fact control Babylon and the remnants of its empire for a time after its sack by the [[Hittites]] in 1531 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Lambert, The Home of the First Sealand Dynasty, Journal of Cuneiform Studies, vol. 26, no. 1, pp. 208-210, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanie Dalley]], Babylonian Tablets from The First Sealand Dynasty in the Schoyen Collection, CDL Press, 2009 {{ISBN|1-934309-08-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hittite Old Kingdom
{{Main|Hittites}}

The absolute chronology of the Hittite Old Kingdom hinges entirely on the date of the sack of [[Babylon]]. In 1531 BC, for reasons that are still extremely unclear, Mursili I marched roughly 500 miles from [[Aleppo]] to Babylon, sacked it, and then promptly returned home, never to return. Other than that event, all the available [[chronological synchronism]]s are local to the region in and near [[Anatolia]].

;Third Babylon Dynasty (Kassite)
{{Main|Kassites}}
The [[Kassites]] first appeared during the reign of [[Samsu-iluna]] of the [[First Babylonian Dynasty]] and after being defeated by [[Babylon]], moved to control the city-state of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]]. Some undetermined amount of time after the fall of [[Babylon]], the Kassites established a new [[Babylonia]]n dynasty. The [[Babylonian king list]] identifies 36 kings reigning 576 years, however, only about 18 names are legible. A few more were identified by inscriptions. There is some confusion in the middle part of the dynasty because of conflicts between the [[Babylonian Chronicles|Synchronistic Chronicle]] and [[Babylonian Chronicles|Chronicle P]]. The later kings are well attested from ''[[kudurru]]'' [[stele]]s. Relative dating is from sychronisms with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Assyria]] and the [[Hittites]].

;Mitanni
{{Main|Mitanni}}
Perhaps because the capital of Mitanni, [[Washukanni]], has not yet been found, there are no available king lists, year lists, or royal inscriptions. Fortunately, a fair amount of diplomatic, [[Hittites|Hittite]], and [[Assyria]]n sources exist to firm up the chronology. Having become powerful under Shaushtatar, Mitanni eventually falls into the traditional trap of dynasties, the contest for succession. Tushratta and Artatama II both claim the kingship and the Hittites and Assyrians take advantage of the situation. After that, Mitanni was no longer a factor in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/pdf/6b%20Pharaoh%20and%20his%20Brothers.pdf Pharaoh and his Brothers], S Jakob&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East'', Trevor Bryce, Routledge, 2003, {{ISBN|0-415-25857-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Assyrian Middle Kingdom
{{Main|Assyria}}
Long a minor player, after the defeat of its neighbor [[Mitanni]] by the [[Hittites]], Assyria rises to the ranks of a major power under Ashur-uballit I. The period is marked by conflict with rivals [[Babylon]] and the [[Hittites]] as well as diplomatic exchanges with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], in the [[Amarna letters]]. Note that after the excavation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of various [[Neo-Assyrian]] documents, such as the [[Assyrian king list]], scholars assumed that the chronological data for earlier [[Assyria]]n periods could be taken as accurate history. That view has changed over the years and the early [[Assyria]]n chronology is being re-assessed. Since there is yet no consensus, the traditional order and regnal lengths will be followed.&lt;ref&gt;"Comments on the Nassouhi Kinglist and the Assyrian Kinglist Tradition," J.A.

Beginning under his father, Suppiluliuma I brought the Hittites from obscurity into an empire that lasts for almost 150 years. The Hittite New Kingdom reaches its height after the defeat of [[Mitanni]], an event which ironically leads to the rise of [[Assyria]]. The dynasty ends with the destruction of [[Hattusa]] by parties undetermined but which may have included the [[Sea People]] and the [[Kaskians]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryce, T., [http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/pdf/6a%20The%20Eternal%20Treaty.pdf 'The 'Eternal Treaty' from the Hittite perspective'], BMSAES 6 (2006), 1–11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sürenhagen, D., [https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/6e%20Forerunners.pdf 'Forerunners of the Hattusili-Ramesses treaty'], BMSAES 6 (2006), 59–67&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Hittite Studies in Honor of Harry A.

;Kings of Ugarit
{{Further|Ugarit}}
A client state of [[Mitanni]] and later the [[Hittites]], Ugarit was nonetheless a significant player in the region. While regnal lengths and an absolute chronology for Ugarit are not yet available, the known order of kings and some firm synchronisms make it reasonably placeable in time. The fall of Ugarit has been narrowed down to the range from the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Merneptah]] to the 8th year of [[Pharaoh]] [[Rameses III]] of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]. This is roughly the same time that [[Hattusa]] is destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Ugaritic Studies'', edited by Wilfred G. E.

==Iron Age==
{{Further|Neo-Hittite}}
The [[Early Iron Age]] (12th to 7th centuries BC). While not subject to the long versus short dating issue, chronology in the Ancient Near East is not on a firm footing until the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian rulers in their respective regions. The dates, regnal lengths, and even the names of a number of rulers from that interim period are still unknown. To make matters worse, the few surviving records, such as the Synchronistic Chronicle, give conflicting data.&lt;ref&gt;John Anthony Brinkman, ''A Political History of Post-Kassite Babylonia, 1158–722 B.C.'', Biblical Institute Press, 1968, {{ISBN|88-7653-243-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second Dynasty of Isin
{{Further|Kings of Babylon}}
After the fall of the [[Kassite dynasty]] of Babylon to [[Elam]], power
in the region, and control of Babylon, swung to the city-state of Isin. Assyria at this time was extremely weak, except during the reign of the powerful Assyrian ruler [[Tiglath-Pileser I]]. Other polities in the area had yet to recover from the [[Bronze Age collapse]].&lt;ref&gt;A Poebel, "The Second Dynasty of Isin According to a New King-List Tablet," ''Assyriological Studies'' 15, Oriental Institute of Chicago, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

;Middle-Assyrian period
{{Further|Assyria}}
After the Middle Assyrian Kingdom there is an uncertain period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed synchronisms with Egypt in the previous period.

'''Thomas Steven Molnar''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|j|ɔː|l|n|ɑr}}; {{lang-hu|Molnár Tamás}}; 26 July 1921, [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]] – 20 July 2010, [[Richmond, Virginia]]) was a [[Catholic]] [[philosopher]], [[historian]] and [[political theorist]].

== Life ==
Molnar completed his undergraduate studies at the [[University of Brussels]] in Belgium and received his Ph.D. in philosophy and history from [[Columbia University]] in New York City.

He was visiting professor of philosophy of religion at the [[University of Budapest]]. As author of over forty books in French and English he published on a variety of subjects including religion, politics, and education. He emigrated to the [[United States]], where he taught for many years at [[Brooklyn College]]. Molnar said he was inspired by [[Russell Kirk]]'s ''The Conservative Mind''. Like Kirk, he wrote a good deal for the magazine ''[[National Review]].'' In addition, Kirk and Molnar were founding board members of [[Una Voce America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reginamag.com/update-latin-mass-america-today/|title=Update: The Latin Mass in America Today|work=Regina|date=September 26, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molnar admired [[Charles Maurras]] and wrote that French failure to honor Maurras' conservative values was a component of the "agony of France".&lt;ref&gt;Molnar, Thomas (1999). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/ModernAge-1999q4-00337 "Charles Maurras, Shaper of an Age,"] ''Modern Age'', Vol. XLI, No. 4, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molnar was married with Ildiko and has one son, Eric. He died at the age of 89 on Tuesday 20 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://obits.nj.com/obituaries/starledger/obituary.aspx?pid=144235132|title=Obituary: Thomas Steven Molnar|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|date=July 23, 2010|accessdate=September 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewcusack.com/2010/07/26/thomas-molnar/ "Thomas Molnar, 1921–2010,"] ''Andrew Cusack'', July 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the awards Molnar received was the [[Széchenyi Prize]], from the President of the Republic of Hungary.

'''Thum Ping Tjin''' ({{zh|c=覃炳鑫|p=Tán Bǐng Xīn}}) (born 17 December 1979),&lt;ref name="Singapore National Olympic Council" /&gt; also known as '''PJ Thum''', is a Singaporean historian and former national swimmer. He is a research fellow at the [[University of Oxford]] and the coordinator of Project Southeast Asia,&lt;ref name="Pingtjin Thum"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pingtjin Thum |url=http://projectsoutheastasia.com/people/academics/pingtjin-thum |website=Project Southeast Asia |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; a collective of scholars of Southeast Asia at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Project Southeast Asia |url=http://projectsoutheastasia.com/about |website=Project Southeast Asia |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Singaporean to swim the [[English Channel]],&lt;ref name="Pingtjin Thum" /&gt; he represented his country in four swim races at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Singapore National Olympic Council" /&gt;

==Background==

Born on 17 December 1979&lt;ref name="Singapore National Olympic Council" /&gt; in Singapore, Thum received his early education at five of the [[Anglo-Chinese School]]s. He went to [[Harvard College]] at the age of 16 and graduated in 2000 with a bachelor's degree in East Asian studies. A [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]], he attended [[Hertford College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he read for a second bachelor's degree in modern history and politics.

In early 2005, Thum was a teacher at [[Anglo-Chinese School (International) Singapore|Anglo-Chinese School (International)]] in Singapore. He later returned to Oxford on a [[Commonwealth Scholarship]], where he completed a [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] in modern history at [[Hertford College]]. From 2006 to 2007, he was also a warden at Frewin Hall, [[Brasenose College]].

From 2012 to 2014, Thum was a research fellow at the Asia Research Institute, [[National University of Singapore|National University of Singapore (NUS)]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/research-cluster/cluster-members/cultural-studies.html Cultural Studies in Asia cluster, Asia Research Institute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222114806/http://www.ari.nus.edu.sg/research-cluster/cluster-members/cultural-studies.html |date=22 December 2015 }} List of current and former members of the Cultural Studies in Asia cluster at the Asia Research Institute, National University of Singapore&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2014, Thum has been a research associate at Oxford's Centre for Global History; a fellow of [[Green Templeton College]]; and the coordinator of Project Southeast Asia, an Oxford initiative to expand its range of scholarly expertise on Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://projectsoutheastasia.com/people/academics/pingtjin-thum Pingtjin Thum, Project Southeast Asia] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117093627/http://projectsoutheastasia.com/people/academics/pingtjin-thum |date=17 November 2015 }} Thum's biographical page at Project Southeast Asia, University of Oxford&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Thum was elected as a [[Young Global Leaders|Young Global Leader]] by the [[World Economic Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders/pingtjin-thum/index.html?link=no Pingtjin Thum, World Economic Forum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222123149/http://www.weforum.org/young-global-leaders/pingtjin-thum/index.html?link=no |date=22 December 2015 }} Thum's biographical page at the World Economic Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018, [[Al Jazeera]] interviewed Thum for the documentary "The House That Lee Built"; Thum stated when he was a research fellow at NUS, he published and gave lectures about his research, which showed that Singapore's founding [[Prime Minister of Singapore|Prime Minister]] [[Lee Kuan Yew]] "had lied about his use of detention without trial from the 1960s onward." According to Thum, shortly afterwards a senior staff member at NUS privately informed him that he "would never be able to work in Singapore as an academic... again".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Al Jazeera English|title=🇸🇬 Singapore: The House that Lee Built {{!}} People and Power|date=2018-03-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c27vAhUJQdc|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412092936/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c27vAhUJQdc|archive-date=12 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about this, a NUS spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/nus-responds-to-al-jazeera-interview|title=NUS responds to Al Jazeera interview|last=hermes|date=2018-03-15|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424231312/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/nus-responds-to-al-jazeera-interview|archive-date=24 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Swimming career==
Thum represented Singapore in four swim races at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name="Singapore National Olympic Council"&gt;{{cite web |title=Thum Ping Tjin |url=http://www.singaporeolympics.com/olympians/thum-ping-tjin/ |website=Singapore National Olympic Council |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his studies at the [[University of Oxford]], Thum captained the university's swimming team and earned two Blues times. In 2002, he retired from the Singaporean national swimming team but continued to represent Oxford in swimming.&lt;ref name="Singapore National Olympic Council" /&gt;

On 6 August 2005, Thum swam solo across the [[English Channel]] in 12 hours and 24 minutes, and became the first Singaporean to do so. While preparing for his Channel swim, Thum also set a world record when he swam around the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] in 2 hours and 52 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blueskiescom.com/alumni/aug_sep_05/thumping.htm |website=blueskies.com |title=A "Thumping" Feat by Thum Ping Tjin |accessdate=20 Sep 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods==
{{Main|Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods}}
In March 2018, in response to a call from the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods for submissions, Thum submitted a paper arguing that any legislation by the [[Parliament of Singapore|Singapore Parliament]] against online falsehood must also apply to the [[Government of Singapore|Singapore government]]. He cited the government's use of detention without trial between 1963 and 1988 during [[Operation Coldstore]] and [[Operation Spectrum]]. While the government argued that the detainees were part of a communist plot or Marxist conspiracy to subvert the state, Thum claimed that the government has never produced any evidence to substantiate its claims nor have any detainees been brought to trial on the charges they were detained under. Thum argued that these justifications were false claims made by politicians of the ruling [[People's Action Party|People's Action Party (PAP)]] for the purpose of political gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/submissions-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate/submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-singapore-984a7a2d6ee3|title=Submission to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, Parliament of Singapore|last=Thum|first=Pingtjin|date=2018-02-26|website=Medium|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180629045224/https://medium.com/submissions-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate/submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-singapore-984a7a2d6ee3|archive-date=29 June 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-08-22|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March, the last day of the sitting of the Select Committee, [[Minister for Law (Singapore)|Law]] and [[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Minister [[K. Shanmugam]] questioned Thum about a paper he published in 2013 regarding Operation Coldstore and the formation of Malaysia''.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/5320436/The_Fundamental_Issue_is_Anti-colonialism_Not_Merger_Singapore_s_Progressive_Left_Operation_Coldstore_and_the_Creation_of_Malaysia]&lt;/ref&gt; He said Thum fell short of the standards of an objective historian, saying that he "ignores evidence which you don't like, you ignore and suppress what is inconvenient and in your writings you present quite an untrue picture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906|title=Historian Thum Ping Tjin, Shanmugam cross swords on Singapore's communism-related past - Channel NewsAsia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212300/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906|archive-date=30 March 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=30 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thum countered that his paper had been peer-reviewed and that no historian had stepped forward to contradict the central thrust of his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/shanmugam-historian-thum-ping-tjin-spar-communist-activities-1950s-1960s-123507433.html|title=Shanmugam, historian Thum Ping Tjin spar over communist activities in 1950s-1960s&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180412130046/https://sg.news.yahoo.com/shanmugam-historian-thum-ping-tjin-spar-communist-activities-1950s-1960s-123507433.html|archive-date=12 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=12 April 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Channel NewsAsia|''Channel NewsAsia'']] and ''[[The Straits Times]]'' reported that Thum admitted that there were parts of the paper which he could have worded better, that some of his statements were misleading, and that he had not read nor bother to quote many of the accounts of some communist leaders as he felt that those accounts were unreliable. These included the first-hand accounts of [[Chin Peng]], the leader of the [[Malayan Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906 Historian Thum Ping Tjin, Shanmugam cross swords on Singapore's communism-related past.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330212300/https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-shanmugam-cross-swords-on-singapore-s-10087906|date=30 March 2018}} Channelnewsasia.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/shanmugam-grills-research-fellow-and-says-he-is-not-an-objective-historian|title=Minister K.

He insisted that his "overall point" in his article "that [[Operation Coldstore]] was fundamentally motivated by political, not security, reasons, stands".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@pj_85357/follow-up-submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-f1c34a2d9365|title=Follow up Submission to the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, Parliament of…|last=Thum|first=Pingtjin|date=2018-05-03|website=Medium|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506152652/https://medium.com/@pj_85357/follow-up-submission-to-the-select-committee-on-deliberate-online-falsehoods-parliament-of-f1c34a2d9365|archive-date=6 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-08-22|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactions ===
Civil activists groups Community Action Network, Function 8, and ''Maruah'', as well as activists Kirsten Han, [[The Online Citizen|Terry Xu]], and Thum himself, criticised the open hearings, accusing the Select Committee of failing to adhere to its own terms of reference, and claiming the hearings had not been conducted in an open or consultative manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://singaporecan.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/civil-society-activists-criticise-singapores-select-committee-hearings/|title=Civil society activists criticise Singapore’s Select Committee hearings|date=2018-04-02|work=Community Action Network, Singapore|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728223334/https://singaporecan.wordpress.com/2018/04/02/civil-society-activists-criticise-singapores-select-committee-hearings/|archive-date=28 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/select-committee-to-look-into-complaints-on-public-hearings-10100610|title=Select Committee to look into complaints on public hearings: Charles Chong|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/maruah-slams-select-committees-confrontational-stance|title=Maruah slams Select Committee’s ‘confrontational stance’|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter signed by 170 academics was submitted to Chong, criticising the hearing as an attempt to attack and destroy Thum's credibility and discredit his research, with the effect of stifling the freedom of expression and academic freedom in Singapore.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/thum-ping-tjins-submission-a-political-piece-and-he-must-expect-to-be-questioned-about-its|title=Thum Ping Tjin must expect to be questioned, says Charles Chong in response to open letter by academics|last=hermesauto|date=2018-04-17|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180424225914/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/thum-ping-tjins-submission-a-political-piece-and-he-must-expect-to-be-questioned-about-its|archive-date=24 April 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180515163318165|title=Academic freedom faces 'grave threat' from parliament - University World News|website=www.universityworldnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180515211935/http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20180515163318165|archive-date=15 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-08-22|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from six of Thum's colleagues at the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia also expressed concerns about how Thum was treated at the hearing, saying that Thum's research, which Shanmugam had criticised, had "already met the rigorous standards of examination at Oxford and peer review by fellow historical experts on the region". The letter also expressed concerns about the "implications for academic freedom, and for freedom of expression in Singapore", saying that the hearing "appears designed to intimidate those who seek to publish the truth".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In response, Chong argued that it was Thum who had chosen to make a political point in his written submission to the Select Committee, and that while Thum was entitled to his views, he must expect to be questioned about his claims.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; He also characterised Thum's submission as a "political piece" rather than an "academic dissertation".&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Chong also released a report based upon attached emails between two trustees of Project Southeast Asia that were inadvertently copied to the Select Committee, showing email discussions between Thum and Philip Kreager from the University of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia regarding the drafting and sharing of a letter in support of Thum.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/historian-thum-ping-tjin-appears-to-be-involved-in-coordinated-attempt-to-subvert Historian Thum Ping Tjin appears to be involved in coordinated attempt to subvert parliamentary processes: Charles Chong, Politics News &amp; Top Stories - The Straits Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Chong accused Thum of having "engineered" the open letter in support of himself, as well as getting Kraeger to canvass for support on his behalf.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Chong alleged "a coordinated attempt, with foreign actors involved, to try to influence and subvert our parliamentary processes".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Kreager called Chong's statement "clearly preposterous", insisting that the emails were merely to "exchange views", and accusing Chong of imagining a "conspiracy".&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/allegations-conspiring-historian-thum-subvert-parliamentary-processes-preposterous-oxford|title=Allegations of conspiring with historian Thum to subvert parliamentary processes ‘preposterous’: Oxford academic|work=TODAYonline|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April, the [[Parliament of Singapore#Parliament Secretariat|Parliament Secretariat]] wrote to Thum to clarify his academic credentials following his claims to be a "research fellow in history" in his submission and holding "a visiting professorship in anthropology at Oxford University" during his oral testimony. Following media enquiries, the University of Oxford replied that Thum was a research associate at the School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/thum-ping-tjin-is-research-associate-with-anthropology-school-oxford|title=Thum Ping Tjin is research associate with anthropology school: Oxford, Politics News &amp; Top Stories - The Straits Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501235409/https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/thum-ping-tjin-is-research-associate-with-anthropology-school-oxford|archive-date=1 May 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=1 May 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
On 11 April 2018, the [[Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority|Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA)]] notified Thum and [[Kirsten Han]], an activist and freelance journalist, that their 18 February 2018 application to register a private company "OSEA Private Limited" was rejected. ACRA released a press statement which stated that the company was "clearly political in nature" and contrary to Singapore's national interests.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.sg/~/sgpcmedia/media_releases/acra/press_release/P-20180411-1/attachment/11042018_Media%20statement_Rejection%20of%20application%20by%20OSEA%20pte%20ltd%20to%20register%20as%20a%20pte%20ltd%20company%20by%20shares.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Straits Times]]'', "this is the first publicised case of a proposed incorporated entity having its application rejected due to foreign funding for domestic political activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/acra-rejects-company-application-from-thum-ping-tjin-kirsten-han-says-it-has-foreign|title=Acra rejects company application from Thum Ping Tjin, Kirsten Han; says it has foreign funding links to George Soros|last=hermesauto|date=2018-04-11|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705025338/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/acra-rejects-company-application-from-thum-ping-tjin-kirsten-han-says-it-has-foreign|archive-date=5 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSEA was to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Observatory Southeast Asia Limited (OSEA-UK). ACRA noted that, in his application, Thum had stated that OSEA-UK has received a US$75,000 grant from the Foundation Open Societies Institute (FOSI), a charitable foundation closely associated with the [[Open Society Foundations|Open Society Foundations (OSF)]], which was founded by [[George Soros]]. In their press release, ACRA argued that "OSF, founded and led by George Soros, was expressly established to pursue a political agenda the world over, and has a history of involvement in the domestic politics of sovereign countries". ACRA cited how the OSEA application proposed to organise "Democracy Classroom" sessions, workshops and events in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/thum-ping-tjin-and-kirsten-han-try-set-foreign-funded-firm-acra-rejects-application-which|title=Company that historian Thum and activist Kirsten Han tried to set up 'contrary to national interests': Acra|last=|first=|date=11 April 2018|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505065757/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/thum-ping-tjin-and-kirsten-han-try-set-foreign-funded-firm-acra-rejects-application-which|archive-date=5 May 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;OSEA-UK rejected the accusations as "unfounded", insisting that New Naratif was supported by revenue from its members, and denying that FOSI or OSF was involved in its editorial decisions or daily operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://newnaratif.com/journalism/statement-new-naratif/|title=A Statement from New Naratif - New Naratif|work=New Naratif|access-date=2018-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709201350/https://newnaratif.com/journalism/statement-new-naratif/|archive-date=9 July 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2018, Select Committee chairman [[Charles Chong]] noted that Thum and [[Philip Kreager]] – both trustees of Oxford's Project Southeast Asia – were directors of OSEA-UK on the British government's company registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/full-charles-chong-says-historian-thum-had-engineered-support-himself-points-coordinated |title=In full: Charles Chong says historian Thum had 'engineered' support for himself, points to 'coordinated attempt' with 'foreign actors' to subvert parliamentary process&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=1 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180501225436/https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/full-charles-chong-says-historian-thum-had-engineered-support-himself-points-coordinated |archive-date=1 May 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting with Mahathir Mohamad==
On 30 August 2018, Thum, [[Tan Wah Piow]] and others met [[Mahathir Mohamad]], the [[Prime Minister of Malaysia]], and asked him to take a lead role in promoting democracy in Southeast Asia. This prompted [[Seah Kian Peng]], a Singaporean Member of Parliament, to post on [[Facebook]] that "it appears quite clear to me that Thum does not wish Singapore well"; some people also called Thum a "traitor" online. Law and Home Affairs Minister [[K. Shanmugam]] commented that to invite "a foreign politician, to intervene in our domestic politics ... is an absolute no no". Thum rejects the notion that he is a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Ridiculous and unfounded’: Thum Ping Tjin on notion that he is a traitor |url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/thum-ping-tjin-mahathir-meeting-response-to-criticism-10678814|date=3 September 2018&lt;!-- 12:29PM--&gt;|website=Channel NewsAsia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thum, [[Kirsten Han]] and [[Jolovan Wham]], who also met Mahathir, sent letters of complaint to [[Lee Hsien Loong]], the [[Prime Minister of Singapore]], denouncing the conduct of Seah, who is also a member of the Select Committee on Deliberate Online Falsehoods, for making serious accusations without substantiation. Han responded that Seah's Facebook post "dog-whistled to online trolls and unleashed abusive online harassment – although he's since called for civility, he has not retracted his claims nor provided evidence, and his allegations continue to provide fodder for personal attacks". The trio also urged [[Charles Chong]], the chairperson of the Select Committee, to "take leadership in promoting responsible behaviour and engaging in evidence-based discussion".&lt;ref&gt;https://sg.news.yahoo.com/3-activists-met-mahathir-ask-pm-lee-probe-mp-seah-kian-pengs-highly-irresponsible-comments-064503175.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] replied to Thum's letter: "We can have vigorous debates within Singapore about our own affairs. But you cross a red line when you invite foreign powers or foreign leaders into Singapore politics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=MHA responds to activists' letter of complaint to PM Lee Hsien Loong |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/mha-responds-to-activists-letter-of-complaint-to-pm |work=The Straits Times |date=6 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* July 5: Al-Shabaab officially lifts its ban on some [[aid agency|aid agencies]], but upholds it later in the month vis-a-vis certain organizations. As an explanation for this discrepancy, the group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Dhere indicates that the group has no issue with allowing both Muslim and non-Muslim individuals from helping the drought-impacted people as long as those groups harbor no ulterior motives in doing so. Dhere adds that his organization believes that many aid agencies are exaggerating their relief requirements so as to satisfy their own selfish objectives. He also suggests that the actual nature of many of the relief operations are twofold: first, some of the aid workers are in effect attacking as "spies", while others, including the UN, he charges have a tacit political agenda not in keeping with what they claim to be doing. In addition, Dhere alleges that aid agencies that are providing assistance in neighboring countries are attempting to siphon away the various Muslim peoples of Somalia in order to more easily indoctrinate them into Christianity. Al-Shabaab members are reported to have intimidated, kidnapped and killed some aid workers, leading to a suspension of humanitarian operations and an exodus of relief agents.&lt;ref name="Aasasrbsagft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201107260329.html|title=Somalia's Al-Shabaab Rebels Ban Some Aid Groups From Territories|publisher=Allafrica.com|date=July 22, 2011|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, AU troops step up efforts in late July 2011 to protect civilians and aid workers from attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/14878146/article-Street-battles-in-Somali-capital-amid-famine-help|title=Street battles in Somali capital amid famine help|publisher=Heraldsun.com|date=|accessdate=2012-08-04}}{{Dead link|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, they are overruled by Ahmed Abdi Godane, a northern commander credited with strengthening the group's ties with Al-Qaeda.

* September 28: According to AMISOM official Col. Cyrus Oguna, the Somali National Army and Kenyan AU naval, air and ground forces launched a surprise attack on Kismayo, capturing the city with little resistance mounted by Al-Shabaab. The spokesman asserts that the insurgents incurred "heavy losses" during the offensive, whereas no allied soldiers were wounded or killed. Fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia also reportedly assisted the SNA and AU troops, who led the charge. Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab states that "fierce fighting" is underway between his comrades and the Somali and AMISOM forces. Local residents similarly indicate that the allied troops have seized the port, but the militants are still present elsewhere in the town and are quickly making their way toward the frontlines in vehicles. The Islamist group's propaganda radio station is also still reportedly broadcasting material and allegedly attempting to trick residents into fleeing toward the oncoming Somali government and AMISOM troops. Kismayo is regarded as Al-Shabaab's last major stronghold on account of the revenue that the group has been able to generate for itself through exporting charcoal and levying port taxes on imported goods. Col. Oguna indicates that capturing the city "may signal the end of al-Shabab because Kismayo has been the bastion which has financed activities of the al-Shabab in other regions of Somalia". Owing to uncertainty as to who will administer the town after the Islamists have been completely ousted, the AU spokesman adds that the offensive was "meticulously planned".&lt;ref name="Apkfalrsoaqlmis"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kenyan forces attack last remaining stronghold of al-Qaeda-linked militants in Somalia|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenyan-forces-attack-last-remaining-stronghold-of-al-qaida-linked-militants-in-somalia/2012/09/28/c6905994-0937-11e2-9eea-333857f6a7bd_story.html|archive-url=http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20120929052204/http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/kenyan-forces-attack-last-remaining-stronghold-of-al-qaida-linked-militants-in-somalia/2012/09/28/c6905994-0937-11e2-9eea-333857f6a7bd_story.html|archive-date=29 September 2012|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=Associated Press|date=28 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gktlbaoscok"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chonghaile|first=Clar Ni|title=Kenyan troops launch beach assault on Somali city of Kismayo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/kenyan-soldiers-capture-kismayo-somalia|accessdate=28 September 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=28 September 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*December 7: Kenyan Anti-Terrorism Police Unit officers confess to Al-Jazeera that they are responsible for almost 500 [[extrajudicial killing]]s. The murders reportedly total several hundred homicides every year. They include the assassination of Abubaker Shariff Ahmed "Makaburi", an Al-Shabaab associate from Kenya, who was among 21 Muslim radicals allegedly murdered by the Kenyan police since 2012. According to the agents, they resorted to killing after the Kenyan police could not successfully prosecute terror suspects. In doing so, the officers indicate that they were acting on the direct orders of Kenya's National Security Council, which consists of the Kenyan President, Deputy President, Chief of the Defence Forces, Inspector General of Police, National Security Intelligence Service Director, Cabinet Secretary of Interior, and Principal Secretary of Interior. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta and the National Security Council of Kenya members deny operating an extrajudicial assassination program. Additionally, the officers suggest that Western security agencies provided intelligence for the program, including the whereabouts and activities of government targets. They assert that Britain supplied further logistics in the form of equipment and training. One Kenyan officer within the Council's General Service Unit also indicates that Israeli instructors taught them how to kill. The head of the [[International Bar Association]], Mark Ellis, cautions that any such involvement by foreign nations would constitute a breach of international law.

'''Trojan skinheads''' (also known as '''traditional skinheads''' or '''trads''') are individuals who identify with the original [[United Kingdom|British]] [[skinhead]] [[subculture]] of the late 1960s, when [[ska]], [[rocksteady]], [[reggae]], and [[soul music]] were popular, and there was a heavy emphasis on [[Mod (subculture)|mod]]-influenced clothing styles. Named after the [[record label]] [[Trojan Records]], these skinheads identify with the subculture's [[Jamaica]]n [[rude boy]] and British [[working class]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reggaereggaereggae.com/Special%20Articles.htm Special Articles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217000127/http://www.reggaereggaereggae.com/Special%20Articles.htm |date=2008-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Old Skool Jim.

==Spirit of '69==
The phrase ''Spirit of '69'' is used by traditional skinheads to commemorate what they identify as the [[skinhead]] [[subculture]]'s [[wikt:heyday|heyday]] in 1969. The phrase was popularized by a group of [[Scotland|Scottish]] skinheads called the [[Glasgow]] Spy Kids.&lt;ref name="skinheadnation.co.uk"/&gt; A skinhead history book entitled ''Spirit of 69: A Skinhead Bible'' was written by George Marshall, a skinhead from Glasgow, in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Marshall, George 1991"/&gt;   Marshall documents the origins and development of the skinhead subculture, describing elements such as music, dress, and politics in an attempt to refute many popular perceptions about skinheads; the most common being that they are all racists.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5470">'''Walley Chamberlain Oulton''' (1770?–1820?) was an Irish playwright, theatre historian and man of letters.

==Life==
Born in [[Dublin]], he was educated there in a private school. While a schoolboy he achieved some reputation as a writer of farces and musical extravaganzas, and his dramatic essays were performed at the Dublin theatres in [[Smock Alley Theatre|Smock Alley]], [[Crow Street Theatre|Crow Street]], Capel Street, and [[Fishamble Street]]. Most of these pieces were published.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

About 1786, Oulton left Dublin, still a youth, to try his fortunes in London. [[John Palmer (actor)|John Palmer]], the lessee of the Royalty Theatre in [[Wellclose Square]], accepted the offer of his services, and in 1787 he produced Oulton's ‘Hobson's Choice, or Thespis in Distress,’ a satire on contemporary theatrical enterprise. Its boldness annoyed the managers of the patent-houses, who were engaged in a fierce struggle with Palmer. Oulton then induced an acquaintance to offer in her name his next piece, ‘As it should be,’ to [[George Colman the younger]] of the Haymarket, where it was produced on 3 June 1789. The piece was published anonymously; but Colman discovered its author, and gave Oulton much encouragement. On 7 July 1792 he produced a short piece by Oulton, ‘All in Good Humour’ (London, 1792); there followed at the same house ‘Irish Tar,’ a musical piece, 24 August 1797; ‘The Sixty-third Letter,’ a musical farce, 28 July 1802; ‘The Sleep-walker, or which is the Lady?’ 15 June 1812; and ‘My Landlady's Gown,’ 10 August 1816. Meanwhile, at Covent Garden, Oulton secured the production of two similar pieces, ‘Perseverance,’ 2 June 1789, and ‘Botheration,’ on 2 May 1798. [[David Erskine Baker]] credited him with the choruses in [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]]'s ‘Pizarro,’ which was produced in 1799. In 1798 he provided two pantomimes, ‘Pyramus and Thisbe’ and the ‘Two Apprentices,’ for the Birmingham theatre.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

His last connection with the stage was on 27 February 1817, when his farce ‘Frighten'd to Death’ was produced at Drury Lane.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

==Works==
In 1784, there appeared the ‘Haunted Castle,’ the ‘Happy Disguise,’ and the ‘New Wonder;’ in 1785 the ‘Madhouse,’ ‘New Way to keep a Wife at Home,’ ‘Poor Maria,’ the ‘Recruiting Manager,’ and ‘Curiosity.’ The ‘Haunted Castle’ and the ‘Madhouse’ are said to have held the stage for some years.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

Oulton was acquainted with the work of [[August von Kotzebue]] on which Sheridan's play ''Pizarro'' was based, and produced in 1800 a volume called ‘The Beauties of Kotzebue.’{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

Between 2 January and 26 February 1787, he produced a tri-weekly sheet, called ''The Busybody'', on the model of ''[[The Spectator]]''; at the twenty-fifth number it ceased. The whole work was issued in two volumes in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;‘The Busybody: a Collection of Periodical Essays, Moral, Whimsical, Comic, and Sentimental, by Mr. Oulton, Author of several Fugitive Pieces,’ London.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795 he published, under the pseudonym of ‘George Horne, D.D.,’ two tracts attacking the pretensions of [[Richard Brothers]] the prophet and of his disciple [[Nathaniel Brassey Halhed]]. The first was entitled ‘Sound Argument, dictated by Common-sense’ (Oxford, 1795); the second, ‘Occasional Remarks addressed to N. B. Halhed, Esq.’ (London, 1795).{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

Oulton argued for the authenticity of ''Vortigern'', one of the [[Ireland Shakespeare forgeries]]. He issued an anonymous pamphlet, ‘Vortigern under Consideration’ (1796), on [[Samuel Ireland]]'s behalf.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

On recent theatrical history, he wrote ‘The History of the Theatres of London from 1771 to 1795,’ which appeared in 1796 in two volumes, a continuation of [[Benjamin Victor (theatre manager)|Benjamin Victor]]'s ‘History.’ For James Barker,&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029564659#page/n29/mode/2up&lt;/ref&gt; the theatrical publisher, he prepared in 1802, mainly ‘from the manuscripts of Mr. Henderson,’ ‘Barker's Continuation of Egerton's Theatrical Remembrancer … from 1787 to 1801.’ Finally he produced ‘A History of the Theatres of London from 1795 to 1817,’ London, 3 vols. 1818.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

Other publications were: 
* ‘Shakespeare's Poems,’ with a memoir, 1804.
* ‘The Traveller's Guide; or, an English Itinerary...a complete Topography of England and Wales...Illustrated with sixty-six correct picturesque views, and a Whole-Sheet Coloured Map of England and Wales,’ London, 1805, 2 vols., published by James Cundee, Ivy-Lane. 
* ‘S. Gessner's Death of Abel,’ a translation, London, 1811. 
* ‘The Beauties of Anne Seward,’ 1813.
* ‘Authentic and Impartial Memoirs of her late Majesty Charlotte, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland … assisted by eminent literary Characters,’ 1819. 
* ‘Picture of Margate and its Vicinity, with a Map and Twenty Views,’ 1820.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

After 1820 Oulton disappears.{{sfn|Lee|1895}}

'''Walt Whitman Rostow''' (also known as '''Walt Rostow''' or '''W.W. Rostow''') {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OBE}} (October 7, 1916 – February 13, 2003) was an American [[economist]] and political theorist who served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|Special Assistant for National Security Affairs]] to [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] from 1966 to 1969.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=The Cold Warrior Who Never Apologized |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/vietnam-walt-rostow.html |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |title=Voice of U.S. Policy. Walt Whitman Rostow |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B0DE4DC143AE63ABC4B52DFB266838C679EDE&amp;legacy=true |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 13, 1967  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent for his role in the shaping of [[US foreign policy]] in Southeast Asia during the 1960s, he was a staunch [[anti-communist]], noted for a belief in the efficacy of [[capitalism]] and [[free enterprise]], strongly supporting [[US involvement in the Vietnam War]]. Rostow is known for his book ''[[Rostow's stages of growth|The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto]]'' (1960), which was used in several fields of [[social science]].

His older brother [[Eugene V. Rostow|Eugene Rostow]] also held a number of high government foreign policy posts.

==Early life==
Rostow was born in [[Manhattan, New York City]], to a Russian Jewish immigrant family. His parents, Lillian (Helman) and Victor Rostow,&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/viewindexcard/10.1093$002fanb$002f9780198606697.article.1401158&lt;/ref&gt; were active [[socialist]]s, and named Walt after [[Walt Whitman]]. His brother [[Eugene Rostow|Eugene]], named for [[Eugene V. Debs]], became a legal scholar, and his brother Ralph, after [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], a department store manager.

Rostow entered [[Yale University]] at age 15 on a full scholarship, graduated at 19, and completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] there in 1940. He also won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to study at [[Balliol College|Balliol College, Oxford]], where he completed a B.Litt. degree. In 1936, during the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis]], he assisted broadcaster [[Alistair Cooke]], who reported on the events for the [[NBC]] radio network. After completing his education, he started teaching economics at [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Professional and academic career==
During [[World War II]], Rostow served in the [[Office of Strategic Services]] under [[William Joseph Donovan]]. Among other tasks, he participated in selecting targets for US bombardment. [[Nicholas Katzenbach]] would later joke: "I finally understand the difference between Walt and me [...] I was the navigator who was shot down and spent two years in a German prison camp, and Walt was the guy picking my targets."

In 1945, immediately after the war, Rostow became assistant chief of the German-Austrian Economic Division in the [[United States Department of State]] in Washington, D.C. In 1946, he returned to Oxford as the [[Harold Vyvyan Harmsworth Professor of American History]]. In 1947, he became the assistant to the Executive Secretary of the [[Economic Commission for Europe]], and was involved in the development of the [[Marshall Plan]].

Rostow spent a year at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] as the [[Pitt Professor of American History and Institutions]]. He was professor of [[economic history]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) from 1950 to 1961, and a staff member of the [[MIT Center for International Studies|Center for International Studies]] (CIS) at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] from 1951 to 1961. From late 1951 to August 1952, Rostow headed the Soviet Vulnerabilities Project. The project, which was sponsored by CIS and received significant support from the U.S. government, sought to identify Soviet vulnerabilities to political/psychological warfare, and received contributions from top [[Sovietologist]] and psychological warfare specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947-1956|date=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801437113|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=w6TVdT-q7vcC&amp;pg=PA117 117–120]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1955, Rostow headed a group of stalwart cold warriors called the ''[[Quantico, Virginia|Quantico]] Vulnerabilities Panel'' which issued a report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=REPORT OF THE QUANTICO VULNERABILITIES PANEL|url=https://archive.org/details/REPORTOFTHEQUANTICOVULNERABILITIESPANEL86B00269R0008000700015|website=archive.org|date=June 10, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; advocating nuclear coercion toward the Soviet Union. Although the experts were invited by [[Nelson Rockefeller]], their proposal ran contrary to the policy of the Eisenhower administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947-1956|date=2000|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0801437113|pages=[https://books.google.no/books?id=w6TVdT-q7vcC&amp;pg=PA169 169–171]|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, Rostow advised President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] on economic and foreign policy, and in 1958 he became a speechwriter for him. In August 1954, Rostow and fellow [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-connected MIT economics professor [[Max F. Millikan]] convinced Eisenhower to massively increase US foreign aid for development as part of a policy of spreading American-style capitalist [[economic growth]] in Asia and elsewhere, backed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.american.edu/spa/ccps/upload/Tama-Eisenhower-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cia-on-campus.org/mit.edu/max.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130802001502/http://www.cia-on-campus.org/mit.edu/max.html |archivedate=2013-08-02 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.cia-on-campus.org/mit.edu/max.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130802001502/http://www.cia-on-campus.org/mit.edu/max.html |archivedate=2013-08-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement with the Israeli nuclear program==
While working as national security advisor, Rostow became involved in setting the [[Israel–United States relations|United States' posture towards Israel]]. Although he supported military and economic assistance to Israel, Rostow believed that increased public alignment between the two states could run counter to US diplomatic and oil interests in the region. After reviewing the May 1967 report from the Atomic Energy Commission team that had inspected Dimona along with other intelligence, Rostow informed President Johnson that, though the team found [[Nuclear weapons and Israel|no evidence of a nuclear weapons program]], "there are enough unanswered questions to make us want to avoid getting locked in too closely with Israel."

Concerns about Israel's nuclear program were tabled by the United States during the build-up to the [[Six-Day War]] and its aftermath. Though Rostow, Johnson, and Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk]] tried to convince Israel not to resort to military force, they supported Israel once the war began. When the nuclear issue resurfaced in January 1968, just prior to Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]]'s visit to the United States, Rostow recommended that the president make it clear that the United States expected Israel to sign the NPT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/walt-rostow|title=Walt Rostow - Wilson Center|work=wilsoncenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Stages of Economic Growth''==
{{Main article|Rostow's stages of growth}}
In 1960, Rostow published ''The Stages of Economic Growth: A Non-Communist Manifesto'', which proposed the Rostovian take-off model of economic growth, one of the major historical models of economic growth, which argues that economic modernization occurs in five basic stages of varying length: traditional society, preconditions for take-off, take-off, drive to maturity, and high [[mass consumption]]. This became one of the important concepts in the [[Modernization theory|theory of modernization]] in [[social evolutionism]]. Rostow's thesis was criticized at the time and subsequently as universalizing a model of Western development that could not be replicated in places like Latin America or sub-Saharan Africa.

The book impressed presidential candidate [[John F. Kennedy]], who appointed Rostow as one of his political advisers, and sought his advice.&lt;ref name="Selverstone2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marc J. Selverstone|title=A Companion to John F. Kennedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZ8yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT277|date=24 March 2014|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-60886-9|pages=277–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kennedy became president in 1961, he appointed Rostow as deputy to his national security assistant [[McGeorge Bundy]]. Later that year, Rostow became [[Director of Policy Planning|Director]] of the State Department's [[Policy Planning Staff (United States)|Policy Planning Staff]]. After [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], his successor Lyndon B. Johnson promoted Rostow to Bundy's job after he wrote Johnson's first [[State of the Union]] speech. As national security adviser, Rostow was responsible for developing the government's policy in Vietnam, and was convinced that the war could be won, becoming Johnson's main war hawk and playing an important role in bringing Johnson's presidency to an end.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/opinion/vietnam-walt-rostow.html?mcubz=1 Vietnam Walter Rostow]&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Richard Nixon]] became president, Rostow left office, and over the next thirty years taught economics at the [[Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] with his wife [[Elspeth Rostow]], who later became dean of the school. He wrote extensively in defense of free enterprise economics, particularly in [[developing nations]].

==Honors and awards==
Rostow received the [[Order of the British Empire]] (1945), the [[Legion of Merit]] (1945), and the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] (1969).

The '''women in the Israel Defense Forces''' are [[woman|female]] soldiers who serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces]].

Up until 2001 women conscripts served in the [[Women's Affairs advisor#History|Women's Corps]], commonly known by its Hebrew acronym, '''CHEN'''. After a five-week period of basic training they served as clerks, drivers, welfare workers, nurses, radio operators, flight controllers, ordnance personnel, and course instructors.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+il0168%29 |title=Israel |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Pre-independence===
[[File:Mishmar HaEmek.JPG|thumb|left|Women training at [[Mishmar HaEmek]], during the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]]]]
[[File:Haganah Woman.jpg|200px|thumb|A female officer of the [[Haganah]] demonstrates handling  a [[Sten]] gun during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]]]

Before the establishment of the state, women served in combat roles in the militias that [[Israel Defense Forces#History|would become]] the Israel Defense Forces.&lt;ref name=60YearsService /&gt; The rate of women who took part in combat organizations stood at 20%.&lt;ref name=mfaWomen /&gt; At the years before the establishment of the IDF, military service for women existed in the lines of the [[Hashomer]] and [[Haganah]] organizations. The Haganah stated in its law that its lines were open to: "Every Jewish male or female, who is prepared and trained to fulfill the obligation of national defense." Most served as medics, communications specialists, and weaponeers. During WWII approximately 4,000 females volunteered for service in the British assisting forces. One of them, Alice Hatzor-Hirsch, was about 16 when she joined the Hagana. In 1942, she joined the [[British army]] as a driver. "We were more connected than the others," she recalled years later. "A girl becoming a driver in the British army was considered the height of boldness at the time."&lt;ref name=womanValor&gt;{{cite web|last=Ben-Ari|first=Bar|title=A Woman of Valor|url=http://dover.idf.il/IDF/English/News/Up_Close/2007/08/0101.htm|publisher=Israel Defense Forces|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tel-Aviv]] of the 1940s, a battalion was established in which women filled positions in security, weapons transport, and manned anti-aircraft posts. During the winter of 1948, women joined the combat soldiers of the [[Palmach]], who traveled from Tel Aviv to [[Jerusalem]] with their weapons concealed in their clothes. The Palmach arm (thirty percent of which were females) trained nine female platoon commanders, and other female squad commanders.&lt;ref name=womanValor /&gt;

===War of Independence===
On 26 May 1948, Prime Minister [[David Ben Gurion]] officially set up the IDF as the country's army. On 18 August 1948, mandatory conscription for single and married women without children (born between the years 1920-1930) began.&lt;ref name=idfBeg&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idf.il/1283-9679-en/Dover.aspx | title=The Beginning, Women in the Early IDF | publisher=[[IDF Spokesperson]] | date=7 March 2011 | accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women served in many positions including nurses, signal operators, drivers, clerks, cooks and more. The Women's Corps, under which all women served, was responsible for taking care of women soldiers' needs and for their training and integration into different IDF units. The Women's Corps also sent young women soldiers to be teachers in developing areas and immigrant neighborhoods of Israel.&lt;ref name=idfBeg /&gt;

===Post-independence===

Apart from the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]], when manpower shortages saw many Palmach and IDF women taking active part in land battles, women were historically barred from battle in the IDF, serving in a variety of technical and administrative support roles. Soon after the establishment of the IDF, the removal of all women from front-line positions was decreed. Decisive for this decision was the very real possibility of falling into enemy hands as [[prisoners of war]]. It was fair and equitable to demand from women equal sacrifice and risk, it was argued, but the risk for women prisoners of [[rape]] and [[Sexual assault|sexual molestation]] was infinitely greater than the same risk for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Facts+About+Israel/State/The+Israel+Defense+Forces.htm |title=SPOTLIGHT ON ISRAEL: The Israel Defense Forces|publisher=[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |author=Dr. Netanel Lorch |date=May 31, 1997 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of women serving in the IDF then were secretaries. The rest served primarily as instructors, nurses, clerks and telephone operators. A few women flew transport missions in the 1950s and a few women were accepted into flight training in the 1970s, but did not complete the program before it was closed to women.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt;

[[Yael Rom]], the first female pilot trained by the Israeli Air Force, earned her wings in 1951.&lt;ref name="IAFwomandies"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/29471/first-woman-pilot-in-israeli-air-force-dies/ |title=First woman pilot in Israeli Air Force dies|publisher=The Jewish news weekly of Northern California |date=June 2, 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hava Inbar, a lawyer, was appointed the judge of the military court in Haifa in September 1969, thus becoming the first female military judge in the world. "I do not know if I want to be a military judge my whole life," she said in an interview, "but I am glad that I was appointed; it proves that the IDF leaves almost all doors open for its female soldiers."&lt;ref name=womanValor /&gt;

[[File:PikiWiki_Israel_12768_IDF_parade_in_Jerusalem_in_1968.jpg|thumb|IDF female soldiers on parade, Jerusalem, 1968]]
During the [[Yom Kippur War]], due to a growing need for ground forces, women were needed in roles in the field.&lt;ref name=60YearsService /&gt; According to Rina Bar-Tal, chair of the Israel Women's Network, roles for women beyond technical and secretarial support only started to open up in the late 1970s and early '80s, because of manpower shortages. Since then, a few women have earned ranks higher than colonel. In 1986, [[Amira Dotan]], then head of the Women's Corps, became the first female brigadier-general.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt;

==Gender equality==

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Field Training Week for Ground Forces (3).jpg|thumb|180px|IDF infantry instructors course]]
Civilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the [[Israeli Supreme Court|High Court of Justice]] to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president [[Ezer Weizman]], a former IAF commander, told Miller that she'd be better off staying home and darning socks, the court eventually ruled in 1996 that the 
IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill allowing women to volunteer for any position, if they could qualify.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt;

In 2000, the Equality amendment to the Military Service law stated that "The right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men."&lt;ref name=mfaWomen /&gt; The amendment that female lawmakers had drafted granted equal opportunities to women found physically and personally suitable for a job.  The question of who and what was "suitable"  was left to the discretion of military leaders on a case-by-case basis. Women did start to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armored divisions. A few platoons named [[Caracal Battalion|Carakal]] were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. By 2000 Carakal became a full-fledged battalion. Many women would also join the [[Israeli Border Police|Border Police]].&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt;

The first female jet fighter pilot, [[Roni Zuckerman]], received her wings in 2001.&lt;ref name="IAFwomandies" /&gt; By 2006, the first female pilots and navigators graduated from the IAF training course, and several hundred women entered combat units, primarily in support roles, like intelligence gatherers, instructors, social workers, medics and engineers.  When the [[Second Lebanon War]] broke out, it was the first time since 1948 that women were in field operations alongside men. Airborne helicopter engineer Sgt.-Maj. (res.) Keren Tendler was the first female IDF combat soldier to be killed in action.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt;
In November 2007 the Air Force appointed its first woman deputy squadron commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-air-force-appoints-first-female-deputy-squadron-commander-1.234139 |title=Israel Air Force appoints first female deputy squadron commander |publisher=Haaretz.com |author=Yuval Azoulay |date=November 28, 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2011, [[Orna Barbivai]] became the first female [[Aluf|Major-General]] in the IDF upon her promotion to the role of commander of the [[Manpower Directorate]]. She is the second woman to serve on the General Staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4074563,00.html|title=IDF names first female major general|newspaper=[[Yediot Ahronot]]|date=26 May 2011|first=Hanan|last=Greenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=idfPromotionAlufa&gt;{{cite web | work=IDF Spokesperson's Blog | date=23 June 2011 | accessdate=4 July 2011 | title=Israeli Army Celebrates First Female Major General | publisher=IDF Spokesperson | url=http://idfspokesperson.com/2011/06/23/israeli-army-celebrates-first-ever-female-major-general/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Capitan Merav Buchris became the first female ammunition Officer in the Air force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaf.org.il/4379-38661-en/IAF.aspx |title=The Israeli Air Force : First Time Around |publisher=Iaf.org.il |date=2012-02-27 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; she started her military career as a [[Shoher]] at the [[Israeli Air And Space technical college|Technical Academy]] in [[Haifa]].

In 2014, there were several more firsts for women in the IDF. The IDF appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel's first female combat battalion commander;&lt;ref name="algemeiner.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ben-Zvi|first=Gidon|title=First Lady: IDF Appoints First Female Combat Battalion Commander|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2014/01/02/first-lady-idf-appoints-first-female-combat-battalion-commander/|work=[[Algemeiner Journal]]|publisher=[[Simon Jacobson]]|accessdate=15 January 2014|location=Brooklyn, New York, United States|date=2 January 2014|quote=History was made on Wednesday when the Israel Defense Forces appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel’s first female combat battalion commander, Israeli daily Ma’ariv reports.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Shani became the first female combat doctor in an elite counterterror unit in the IDF (specifically, the Duvdevan counterterrorism unit);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=14617 |title=IDF welcomes first female combat doctor in elite counterterror unit |publisher=Israel Hayom |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the IDF decided to allow female kosher supervisors to work in its kitchens on military bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/190635/idf-to-allow-female-kosher-supervisors-to-work-on/ |title=IDF To Allow Female Kosher Supervisors To Work on Military Bases – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2014-01-09 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Service==
Mandatory service for women in the IDF is 24 months, apart from roles specified in law which require a service length of 36 months.&lt;ref name=olimalmadim&gt;{{cite web|title=Service Length for Women|url=http://www.aka.idf.il/giyus/general/?catid=12943&amp;docid=30365|publisher=Israeli Defense Forces|language=Hebrew|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women may be exempted from military service for reasons of religious conscience, marriage, pregnancy, or motherhood. A woman may receive an exemption on religious grounds under the following conditions:&lt;ref name=moia&gt;{{cite web|title=Military Service 2nd Edition|url=http://www.moia.gov.il/NR/rdonlyres/DBF4B5CB-861F-492B-A74B-D31528817568/0/idf_en.pdf|publisher=Israeli Ministry of Immigrant Absorption|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who arrive in Israel at age 17 and over are generally exempt from army service, but may serve on a voluntary basis. Also, women (who are not fighters) are not generally called up for reserve duty if they are married, or if they are beyond age 24.&lt;ref name=moia /&gt;

==Combat roles==

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Female Soldiers Practice Shooting (1).jpg|thumb|Female soldiers of the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in training]]
Clause 16A of the military service law requires that female combat soldiers serve 2 years and 4 months of mandatory service, and continue in reserves service up to age 38.&lt;ref name=serviceStatsAugust2010 /&gt; Each year, 1,500 female combat soldiers are drafted into the IDF.&lt;ref name=womenIDF /&gt; Women currently make up 3% of the IDF's combat soldiers.&lt;ref name=dotzNov11 /&gt; Women were employed in full combat roles during the War of Independence and early years. An incident involving the abuse of a woman's corpse led to their withdrawal from full combat&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; until 2000, when the Caracal Battalion was raised.

In 2014, the IDF appointed Major Oshrat Bacher as Israel’s first female combat battalion commander.&lt;ref name="algemeiner.com"/&gt;

The most notable combat option for women is the [[Caracal Battalion]], which is a light infantry force that is made up of 70 percent female soldiers.&lt;ref name=mfaWomen /&gt; The unit undergoes combat infantry training.&lt;ref name=womenIDF /&gt; There are two other mixed-sex infantry battalions: the Lions of Jordan Battalion and the Bardelas Battalion. The IDF commando K9 unit, [[Oketz]], also drafts females as combat soldiers.&lt;ref name=dotzNov11 /&gt; Women are also allowed to join the [[Combat Intelligence Collection Corps]], and to serve as Search and Rescue personnel in the IDF [[Home Front Command]]'s Search and Rescue Force, officially classified as a combat unit. A pilot program currently being tested has women serving in tanks.

Despite being officially classified as combat soldiers, women in combat roles are not deliberately deployed into combat situations. They are expected to respond in the event a combat situation does erupt, but are not deployed to situations where there is a high risk of combat. The three mixed-sex infantry battalions are deployed to border patrol duties on the Israeli borders with Egypt and Jordan and security duties in the Jordan Valley, and female infantry soldiers are barred from joining the frontline combat infantry brigades which are deployed in the event of war. Female tank crews, who are also only regulated to border guard duties, do not serve in the regular armored combat units.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5089566,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5047996,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's affairs advisor==
{{main| Women's Affairs advisor}}
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Female Soldier Aiming her Weapon.jpg|thumb|The Field Training Week in Southern Israel, part of the IDF Infantry Instructors course (2006)]]
The Women's Corps was dismantled in 2000, so that female soldiers for the first time would fall under the authority of individual units based on jobs and not on gender. They would wear the insignia of their units instead of the insignia of the Women's Corps.&lt;ref name="feldinger"/&gt; The position of Women's Affairs Advisor to the Chief of Staff was created in 2001. The female officer holding the position is in charge of ensuring more opportunities and a suitable environment for female soldiers, as well as better enhancing their skills. The mission of the advisor is described by the IDF as "empowering women, the IDF and Israeli society by promoting conditions that allow for the optimal use of the capabilities of women serving in the IDF; promoting equal opportunities for women during their military service; and assimilating women into military leadership positions."&lt;ref name=dotzNov11 /&gt;

== Service exemptions ==
Sixty–five percent of Israeli women serve in the army, 25 percent opt out on religious grounds, the remainder are exempted for physical, emotional  or marital reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Anne R. Bloom: Women in the Defense Forces, in: Swirski, Barbara und Safir, Marylin P.: Calling the equality bluff – Women in Israel, New York 1991, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; A law passed in 1978 made exemptions for women on religious grounds automatic upon the signing of a simple declaration attesting to the observance of orthodox religious practices. This legislation raised considerable controversy, and IDF officials feared that the exemption could be abused by any nonreligious woman who did not wish to serve and thus further exacerbate the already strained personnel resources of the IDF. Women exempted on religious grounds were legally obliged to fulfill a period of alternative service doing social or educational work assigned to them. In practice, however, women performed such service only on a voluntary basis.&lt;ref name="lcweb2.loc.gov"/&gt;

==2007 Segev Committee report==
[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - The Life of Female Field Intelligence Combat Soldiers (3).jpg|thumb|Field intelligence combat unit]]

In 2007, then Head of Manpower Directorate, Aluf (Maj. Gen.) [[Elazar Stern]], appointed a committee to define women's service in the IDF in the next decade, with the objective of increasing  equal opportunities in women's service in the IDF.&lt;ref name=mfaWomen/&gt; The committee, headed by Maj. Gen. (res.) Yehuda Segev, submitted its report to Stern in September 2007.&lt;ref name=commisionFrzHaaretz&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-freezes-implementation-of-report-calling-for-gender-equality-1.398544 | title=IDF freezes implementation of report calling for gender equality | newspaper=[[Haaretz]] | first=Amos | last=Harel | date=30 November 2011 | accessdate=30 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the 100-page report was presented to the IDF General Staff. [[Rav Aluf]] [[Gabi Ashkenazi]], then-[[Chief of General Staff (Israel)|Chief of Staff]], voiced support for the committee's vision:&lt;ref name=mfaWomen /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The IDF, as a leading organization in Israeli society, designates the service of men and women to a fulfilling and respectful service based upon equal opportunities in the service of [the] IDF and the State of Israel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Flickr - Israel Defense Forces - Caracal Battalion Conducts Concluding Exercise (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Caracal Battalion]] training]]
The committee called for the annulment of the model that has been in place since the 1950s, under which a soldier's length of service and service options is largely determined by gender. "This is an archaic model that causes under-utilization of the resources ... of half of Israeli society, and closes off many opportunities, both during service and for integrating into society after service," the report said.&lt;ref name=commisionFrzHaaretz /&gt;

In 2007, 12 percent of all army jobs were completely closed to women. The report partially attributed it to the shorter length of service, as a barrier to putting women in the most demanding and important jobs. Hence postings are "to a large extent" determined by gender rather than a soldier's talents and abilities. Instead, the length of service "should depend solely on the job, rather than on one's gender."&lt;ref name=commisionFrzHaaretz /&gt;

The report advised making it harder for women to get an exemption from mandatory service and curbing the phenomenon of women falsely claiming exemptions on religious grounds. It also said the criteria for exemptions from service should be the same for both men and women.&lt;ref name=commisionFrzHaaretz /&gt; The panel recommended mandatory quotas for promoting women, with the goal of giving women a "significant presence" in the army's "senior decision-making ranks." In addition, it called for creating an effective, well-funded system to ensure proper working environments for both men and women, and for drafting a "gender code" that would lay down explicit rules for interaction between the sexes. "There should be no jobs or units categorically closed to either women or men," it said. "Service in all units, postings and missions would be joint, subject to the rules of appropriate integration."&lt;ref name=commisionFrzHaaretz /&gt;

The committee proposed opening all jobs to women aside from a handful to be determined by a special committee, whose decisions would require the approval of the Chief of Staff, the [[Israeli Defense Minister|Defense Minister]] and the [[Knesset]] Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. It said the initial screening and assignment process should be unified so that men and women are part of the same system and receive their assignments based on the same criteria, including for acceptance into combat units. The panel proposed implementing this change gradually over the course of a decade.&lt;ref name=commisionFrzHaaretz /&gt;

===Religious objections===
In 1950 chief rabbis [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]] and [[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]] issued a ruling forbidding women to join the IDF.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Rabbinical-association-says-permissible-in-Jewish-law-for-women-to-enlist-to-IDF-354648|title=Rabbinical association says permissible in Jewish law for women to serve in IDF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] ardently opposed women serving in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]], advocating [[sherut leumi|national service]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kahane|first1=Meir|title=Women in the IDF|url=http://mkwords.com/text/index.php?i=96&amp;a=Women%20in%20the%20IDF|website=mkwords.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2014 [[David Lau]] and [[Yitzhak Yosef]] of the Chief Rabbinate were opposed to religious women serving in the IDF, as was Safed Chief Rabbi [[Shmuel Eliyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Lapid-Fire-Chief-Rabbis-over-objection-to-religious-womens-service-in-the-army-337775 |title=Lapid: Fire Chief Rabbis over objection to religious women's service in the army &amp;#124; JPost &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=JPost |date=2013-02-05 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Finance Minister [[Yair Lapid]] opposes this position and wants Lau and Yosef to be removed from the Chief Rabbinate because of it. Economy Minister [[Naftali Bennett]] stated "I believe that all girls should do either IDF service or national service. With that, the attack on the rabbis for their traditional position is an unacceptable attack on the respect due them."&lt;ref name="haaretz1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lis |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.568410 |title=Israeli ministers spar over women serving in army - National Israel News |publisher=Haaretz |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Education Minister [[Shai Piron]] said he backs the chief rabbis' injunction against observant women enlisting in the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Marissa |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/education-minister-backs-rabbis-ban-on-female-enlistment/#ixzz2sx3SWG2M |title=Education minister backs rabbis' ban on Orthodox women in IDF |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Piron had said, “I don’t know of any rabbis that would allow [observant women] to serve in the army. The halachic authorities saw the reality from a joint education and spiritual perspective, this view led them to their halachic conclusion… The problem with IDF service is the general atmosphere that does not allow for a life without [religious] pitfalls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newman |first=Marissa |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/education-minister-backs-rabbis-ban-on-female-enlistment/#ixzz2sx4Pn79B |title=Education minister backs rabbis' ban on Orthodox women in IDF |publisher=The Times of Israel |date=2014-01-13 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; MK [[Elazar Stern]] said, "A week ago the Chief Rabbis announced that a female serving in the IDF results in an [[aveira]] similar to [[Dishonor|Chilul]] [[Shabbat|Shabbos]]. This is tantamount to issuing a call to women, at least those who view themselves as religious, not to serve in the IDF...I served in the IDF for a few years and I state the military cannot function without women unless we lengthen the service of males to 4.5 years. The price that we will pay by the call of the Chief Rabbinate Council that females do not enlist is not that of our daughters, but the daughters of these very same rabbis who don't serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/210612/stern-joins-lapid-in-condemning-the-chief-rabbis.html#sthash.8LEBOSwN.dpuf |title=The Yeshiva World Stern Joins Lapid in Condemning the Chief Rabbis « » Frum Jewish News |publisher=Theyeshivaworld.com |date=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]], the Rabbi of the city of [[Efrat]], supports women's enlistment in the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/176571#.Uvjg65uPKM8 |title=Rabbi Riskin on Women’s Enlistment: It's a Mitzvah - Jewish World - News |publisher=Israel National News |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2014 the Beit Hillel association of national-religious rabbis issued a ruling in Jewish law stating that women are allowed to serve in the IDF; however, Rabbi [[Shlomo Aviner]] claimed that Beit Hillel did not have the authority to make such a ruling.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

Observant Jewish women are allowed to do national service instead of enlisting in the IDF.&lt;ref name="haaretz1"/&gt;

The IDF offers [[Haredim]] men "women free and secular free" recruitment centers. Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon expressed his willingness to relax regulations to meet the demands of ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Regulations regarding gender equality had already been relaxed so that Haredim could be assured that men would not receive physical exams from female medical staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4586197,00.html|title=IDF offers haredim 'women-free' recruitment centers|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual harassment===
In ''Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion'', Stuart A. Cohen has argued that prior to the 1990s, there had existed a general consensus in the IDF that "sexual prowess goes hand in hand with military accomplishment." Even when social attitudes were changing in the 1980s, the IDF was still inclined towards tolerance and a senior army official warned of not blowing the "topic out of all proportion."&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Cohen. ''Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion'', pg. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the ''[[Maariv]]'' reported that only 10% of around 1,000 reported cases of sexual harassment each year are investigated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Starr Sered]]. "A Cultural Climate in the IDF That Legitimises Sexual Harassment of Women Soldiers", in ''What Makes Women Sick?: Maternity, Modesty, and Militarism in Israeli Society'', UPNE, 2000. pg. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Reports of sexual harassment against women in the Israeli army reached an average of one a day in 1999, an increase on the 280 complainants received in 1997. In 1998-99, 54 officers were expelled from the army on such charges, others faced demotion or prison. In one high-profile case, General Yitzchak Mordechai was charged with sexual assault and harassment. Another case involved the promotion of General Nir Galili after being accused of grooming a young female recruit for intimate relations. This issue has led the Israeli military to being described by the feminist American writer [[Laura Sjoberg]] as a "hothouse for exploitive sexual relationships" and a force whose fighting culture is based on "rampant licentiousness."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Sjoberg, Sandra Via. ''Gender, War, and Militarism: Feminist Perspectives'' (2010). pg. 87&lt;/ref&gt; While the army has since tried to curb sexual harassment, it remains a problem. In 2004, it was reported that 1 in 5 women soldiers suffer sexual harassment.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart A. Cohen Israel and Its Army: From Cohesion to Confusion pg. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singing controversy===
{{main|Tzniut#Female singing voice}}
In September 2011, because of a religious ban on men hearing women sing,&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]], [http://revivimen.yhb.org.il/2012/01/13/military-orders-that-contradict-jewish-law/ Military Orders that Contradict Jewish Law]&lt;/ref&gt; nine religiously-observant cadets in the IDF officer's course walked out of an evening seminar on the legacy of the 2008 [[Operation Cast Lead]] in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] when a band comprising two male and two female vocalists took the stage to sing. The commander of the school expelled four of them, after they said they would disobey orders again. The IDF agreed to re-examine regulations on this issue, given the growing number of [[Haredi]] soldiers in combat units.&lt;ref name=singHAaretzSep11&gt;{{cite news |title=IDF: Soldiers cannot skip ceremonies with women singing |author=Amos Harel|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-soldiers-cannot-skip-ceremonies-with-women-singing-1.384288 |newspaper=Haaretz |date=2011-09-14|accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, women soldiers were ordered to leave a post-[[Simhat Torah]] celebration  on orders from IDF rabbis, and asked to dance in a separate area.&lt;ref name=singHaaretzNov11&gt;{{cite news |title=Top settler rabbi: Soldiers will sooner choose death than suffer women's singing |author=Yair Ettinger|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/top-settler-rabbi-soldiers-will-sooner-choose-death-than-suffer-women-s-singing-1.396180 |newspaper=Haaretz|date=2011-11-17 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2011, nineteen reserve Major Generals sent a protest letter to Defense Minister [[Ehud Barak]] and IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz and warned against harming the motivation of women to serve in the army and undermining "the fundamental values of Israeli society." &lt;ref name=singHaaretzNov11 /&gt;
