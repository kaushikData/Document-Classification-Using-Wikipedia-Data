At a meeting hosted by [[University of California, Los Angeles]]'s International Institute on 7 February 2002, Noor Delawari, an advisory board member of the Afghanistan Foundation and chair of the ARO, spoke of the urgent need for aid in Afghanistan:
{{quotation|Half of the arable land has been destroyed. We had 2,000 miles of road; that is almost all gone. There are hundreds of thousands of orphan children. The mortality among the young people is unimaginable, dying of the cold weather. We must provide shelter for them. 8 million people were displaced over the last decade. We need to build 2 million new homes. We need to create a new security force. We need this to take care of the warlords or others who take advantage of the weakness of the social forces.&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite web

Afghan Ambassador [[Said Tayeb Jawad]] visited [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] on 23 February 2007 to deliver the keynote address at the ARO's annual fundraiser, ''Peace Through Education''.&lt;ref name="AfghanEmbassy2" /&gt;

According to a [[United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) Education Fact Sheet (plus Q and A) for Afghanistan, 2007:  
{{quotation|Afghanistan has one the highest proportion of school-age (7-12) children in the world: about 1 in 5 Afghans is a primary school-age child. Despite success in sending children to school, trends in gender disparity in education remains worrisome. For instance, the literary rate for young women (aged 15-24) is only 18 per cent, compared to 50 per cent for boys. The primary school completion rate for boys is 32 per cent versus 13 per cent for girls. In terms of cohort tracking, only 30 percent of girls (age 12 years) reach Grade 5, compared to 56 per cent for boys.

==Biography==

Alba started studying the piano in a young age, with her elder brother, and that defined her Profession. She continued to learn the piano and she was able to perform very complex compositions compared to her age, which made her a special piano player. Alba went to "The English school of Mrs. Miller" and then to the "French School of Mlle. Edges"; she continued her studies in English and French with the help of her father; she showed interest in literature of different writers, specially [[William Shakespeare]].

After completing her higher education, she continued her piano studies with the maestro [[Carlos J. Meneses]] who presented her in some recitals. When the master Meneses returned to the National Conservatory, from which it had separated previously, Alba enrolled in the conservatory as well, and continued her classes with him. She also attended the classes of [[Alberto Villaseñor]], her cousin Pedro Luis Ogazon and [[Ricardo Castro]] who was the Directorate of the Conservatory at that time. [[Ricardo Castro]] frequently changed the piano teachers because of circumstances beyond his control, but this did not prejudice Alba's ability to carry out her studies.

At the end of her piano career at the National Conservatory of Music in 1908, she traveled to New York City and obtained the "B certificate" from the 'Virgil Academy' and she received congratulations from her teacher, Mr. [[A. K. Virgil]].

Considering herself apt to instruct her compatriots, she began teaching music and piano shortly after her return to Mexico following the 'Virgil System'.

In 1910, during his second visit to Mexico, [[Josef Hofmann]] asked Alba to translate his book "La Execución Pianística", a task that she subsequently carried out.
Without abandoning the musical-pianist art, in 1917, she published her book "The Musical Art in Mexico", in which she summarized the musical movement in Mexico until that year. Later she carried out diverse concerts, some with the National Classic Quartet and others.  In 1919, for the first time in Mexico, Alba Herrera y Ogazón with [[Julian Carrillo]] played the "Sonatas of Beethoven". Later she undertook a tour in the republic in company with [[Julián Carrillo]] the director of the National Symphony Orchestra, and Sante Lo Priore, an Italian violinist.

After she finished her tour in the republic, she published her book "Points of View", that consisted of critic essays in music; the book was circulated in 1921.
She then started the preparation of several other books: ''Mosaicos Musicales'', ''Greorge Eliot'', ''My Miserable Hours'' and ''General History of Music''.

As a lecturer Alba Herrera y Ogazón participated effectively in the celebration of the centenary of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], in the conference that was dictated to music, during the time of the romanticism; and was a speaker in the speeches of the inauguration of the Faculty of Music and anniversary, also she taught classes of musical history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cenart.gob.mx/centros/cenidim/publicaciones_tipo.htm|title=Centro Nacional de Investigación, Documentación e Información Musical - Cenidim|accessdate=7 March 2017|author=|authorlink=|date=7 April 2013|language=|website=|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407232327/http://www.cenart.gob.mx/centros/cenidim/publicaciones_tipo.htm|archivedate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a journalist, Alba collaborated actively with the Time, The Illustrated World, The Journal, The Tribune, Magazine of Magazines, Pegasus, El Globo, El Universal Ilustrado, El Universal, and others. She also occasionally collaborated with "Excélsior", "Get to Know Mexico", "La Opinión", "Mexican Herald", "Conservatorio", "Tricolor" Sombra "," Cosmos "," New Democracy "(New York) etc., and she was a member of following corporations: [[Ateneo de la Juventud Mexicana|Ateneo de México]] , Society of Local History Studies of Mexico City, Ateneo Hispánico, PEN Grupo Ariel, Sociedad Pro Arte Patrio, International League of Iberian and Hispanic American Women, and the International Society of Pianoforte Teachers and Players, also held the following positions: lecturer in the former department of aesthetic culture of the Secretariat of Public Education (Mexico), during 1922 to 1927; professor of piano and history of the music, in the National Conservatory and in the faculty of music of the National University of Mexico, independent until its death.
Alba Herrera y Ogazon died in 1931. She spent her last days writing.

The college's decision not to proceed drew criticism from conservative commentators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-158523022.html "Hamilton Capitulates"], ''[[The New Criterion]]'', January 1, 2007 {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} (opinion).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katherine Mangu-Ward, [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116917079496581026 "The New Campus Dissidents"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', January 19, 2007 {{subscription required}} (opinion).&lt;/ref&gt; and the institute was established as an off-campus, independent entity.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cohen, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/education/22conservative.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "Conservatives Try New Tack on Campuses"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Budapest districts.png|right|thumb|The District Map of Budapest]]

'''[[Bauhaus]]''' was a dominant architectural tendency in [[Budapest]], the capital of [[Hungary]], between 1930 and 1948. Large residential buildings, cinemas, churches and even an airport was built in this style, in particular in [[Újlipótváros]] in the XIII district, and [[Városmajor]] and [[Pasarét]] in the II district of the city.

*Villas in Napraforgó utca (District 2, Napraforgó utca 1-22).&lt;ref name="Napraforgó utca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://architectuul.com/architecture/napraforgo-street-1|title=Napraforgó utca|publisher=Architectuul|accessdate=2011-11-11|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, some representatives of the modern architecture style made a proposal to the Budapest Public Works Council to have a whole street designed by the best architects, based on an example in Stuttgart. The plan was implemented one year later. In spite of using small sites, an enthusiastic builder devoted to modern architecture carried out the outstanding plans in a magnificent way. There is a small square in the middle of the street, where a stone displays the names of all architects involved. There are altogether 22 villas, with a creek called Devil’s Trench on one side. Although some of the houses have been rebuilt since then, the original character was maintained nearly everywhere.

Public transport: Bus No. 5.

*Villa with two-storey flats, Lotz Károly utca 4/b. The villa was built in 1933, and the architect decided to apply the two-storey arrangement in order to increase the garden area. The building was designed by Farkas Molnár, an internationally renowned Hungarian master of Bauhaus.
*Villa with variable walls at Harangvirág utca 11. The variable walls enable the residents to create a 100-squaremeter area inside the flats.
*Special villa at Pasaréti út 97. It is a multi-storey building that fits very well with the garden. It was extended in the 70s, maintaining the original idea.
*Villa at Orsó utca 21. It is a building with a roof terrace. It was built on a narrow, sloping site. The architect was Lajos Kozma.
*Residential building at Trombitás utca 32. It seems as if several villas had been built into one, the chessboard like facade allows for a complete separation.
*Roman Catholic Church and monastery in Pasaréti tér. It was built in the centre of the quarter in 1933, according to the solemn and simple plan of Gyula Rimanóczy.

Szent István park (St. Stephen’s Park) (XIII., between the River Danube and Hollán Ernő utca).

This area lies to the North of Margit Bridge and was built in the 1930 with breathtaking speed, along Pozsonyi út. The most scenic place of the whole area is St. Stephen’s Park, part of which has a view on the river, with huge and envied roof terraces. The houses are 25 meters tall, they are all six-storey buildings. Their design and construction began in 1928, on an area of 33,000 square meters.

Most of the houses on that square were designed by Béla Hofstätter and Ferenc Domány. Public transport: Jászai Mari tér: Tram No. 4/6, Tram No. 2.

*Pozsonyi út 53-55. An interesting building with shops, standing on a triangle-shaped site at the corner of Wahrmann Mór köz.
*Budapest Pozsonyi Street Protestant Church (Pozsonyi út 58.) A church and a belfry in modern style with classicist streaks. It was opened in 1940.
*Dunapark House. Pozsonyi út 38-42. A complex of two luxury houses. A cinema was planned to be built between the two houses, but it was not implemented eventually. However, the area of the café increased this way.
*Residential building at Pozsonyi út 33/a. Its unique features are a foyer with an arched wall, standing in a 45 degree angle with the entrance, as well as an elegant doorway.
*Residential building at Tátra utca 5/c. It has especially large balconies, which run all the way along the facade. It also has asymmetric shop facilities.
*Residential building at Pozsonyi út 19. A corner house with a variable facade and interesting arched balconies on the corner.

===Bauhaus on the Killesberg in Stuttgart, Germany===
The [[Weissenhof Estate]], which was built on the Killesberg in Stuttgart in 1927, is one of the best examples for the art of the "new architecture" in Germany. Within no more than 21 weeks, 21 houses containing 63 flats were constructed. The settlement is not an organically grown structure, it is part of the exhibition "Die Wohnung" ("The flat") organised by the German Werkbund in 1927. In [[World War II]] 11 of the 21 houses destroyed. The Bauhaus exhibition street in [[Budapest]], 22 villas in the Napraforgó utca [[Pasarét]] based on the example in Stuttgart.

The international reputation of the Weißenhofsiedlung and its architects brings it 30 000 visitors per year.

'''Benny Andrews''' (November 13, 1930 – November 10, 2006) was an African-American [[Painting|painter]], [[Printmaking|printmaker]], and creator of [[collage]]s. During the 1950s, he studied at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], where he began to take an interest in painting. In 1958, he moved to New York City to pursue artistic and activist work. Among other successes, he created art education programs to serve underprivileged students at [[Queens College]] and participated actively in the [[Black Emergency Cultural Coalition]] (1969). His advocacy of artists of color [[Howardena Pindell]], [[Sam Gilliam]], [[Roy DeCarava]], and others contributed to their increasing visibility and reputation in museums and the historical canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bennyandrews.com/|title=Home - Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=Benny Andrews Estate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received many awards, including the [[John Hay Whitney]] Fellowship (1965–66), the [[New York Council on the Arts]] fellowships (1971–81), and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] Fellowship (1974–81).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/benny-andrews|title=Andrews, Benny, 1930-|last=|first=|date=2005|website=Contemporary Black Biography. Encyclopedia.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Benny Andrews was born into a family of ten on November 13, 1930, in the small community of [[Plainview, Georgia]]. His parents, George and Viola (née Perryman), were sharecroppers.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/nyregion/12andrews.html|title=Benny Andrews, 75, Dies; Painted Life in the South|last=Genocchio|first=Benjamin|date=2006-11-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother and father emphasized the importance of education, religion, and freedom of expression. [[George Andrews (artist)|George Andrews]] himself was a self-taught artist whose drawings and paintings led to renown as the "Dot Man" and a retrospective at the [[Morris Museum of Art]].

Despite his parents' stress on education, they could not afford to let Andrews go to school when they needed his help to pick or plant cotton. He attended high school only in the winter.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/history/historians-miscellaneous-biographies/benny-andrews|title=Benny Andrews facts, information, pictures|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopedia.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews managed to graduate from Burney Street High School in Madison, Georgia in 1948, making him his family's first high school graduate.

He got a two-year scholarship to go to [[Forth Valley College]], whose limited art curriculum made it difficult for him to explore a range of media. His grades were poor, so when his scholarship ran out, he left college to join the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Having served from 1950 to 1953, he used the [[G.I. Bill]] to attend the [[Art Institute of Chicago#The School|School of the Art Institute of Chicago]], where he was trained as an [[abstract expressionist]] &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and received his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]].

In 1962 the ''New York Times'' praised his first New York City solo exhibit.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He received the John Hay Whitney Fellowship for 1965-1966 and a CAPS award from the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com|title=Benny Andrews|last=Cullen|first=Deborah|date=|website=Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=28 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he painted one of his most notable works, ''No More Games'', which highlighted the plight of black artists and became an icon of his emerging [[social justice]] activism in the art world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Benny Andrews," St. James Guide to Black Artists, Thomas Riggs, ed.|last=Tenabe|first=Gabriel|publisher=St. James Press|year=1997|isbn=1558622209|location=Detroit|pages=16|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1968 to 1997, Andrews taught at [[Queens College, City University of New York]] and created an arts program for prisons, one that became a national model.

==Social justice work==
In 1969, Andrews co-founded the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC), an organization that protested the ''[[Harlem on My Mind protest|Harlem on My Mind: Cultural Capital of Black America, 1900-1968]]'' exhibit at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. No African-Americans had been involved in organizing the show, and it contained no art—only photo reproductions and copies of newspaper articles about Harlem.

The BECC then persuaded the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] to launch a similar exhibition of African American artists, but later felt compelled to boycott the Whitney show for similar reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/benny-andrews Benny Andrews: Biography and Much More from Answers.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1982 to 1984, Andrews served as the director of visual arts for the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]. In this position, he had the chance to advocate for fellowships and grants to go to talented black artists who may otherwise have escaped notice.

Andrews traveled in 2006 to the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] to work on an art project with children displaced by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorktimes/2006/Benny Andrews, 75, Dies; Painted Life in the South]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art==
Benny Andrews was a [[Figure painting|figural painter]] in the [[Expressionism|expressionist]] style who painted a diverse range of themes of suffering and injustice, including the [[Holocaust]], [[Indian Removal|Native American forced migrations]], and [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In the 1960s he began to find his own style of painting, which developed parallel to the flourishing [[collage]] moment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Other influences on his work include [[surrealism]] and Southern [[folk art]].  His work hangs in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City; the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]; the [[Studio Museum in Harlem|Studio Museum]] in [[Harlem]] (New York City); the [[High Museum of Art]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington, DC; and the [[Ogden Museum of Southern Art]] in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].

Reflecting his [[minimalism|minimalist]] style, Andrews said he was not interested in how much he could paint, but how little. He incorporated his sparing use of geometrical forms  to convey broader messages about his subjects. Gabriel Tenabe describes his drawing as "delicate, subtle, and intimate... draw(ing) from his past private life in Georgia and his social life in New York." [[Christian symbolism|Christian imagery]] is juxtaposed with sensibilities of [[humanism]] to call out false religion, false democracy, [[sexism]], and [[militarism]] and their roles in creating a failed society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Using various media, Andrews depicted diverse American scenes and people in a figurative style that he felt both reflected the dignity of those he portrayed and served his commitment to social change.

==Family life==
Benny Andrews was married to artist [[Nene Humphrey]] for 20 years. He had three children.

Andrews died of cancer at the age of 75.

==Career==
Cayne then moved to New York in the early 1990s, making a name for herself as a choreographer and [[drag queen|drag performer]].&lt;ref name="NYT 2004"/&gt; About three years after her arrival in NYC, Cayne realized that the term [[transgender]] described how she felt about herself.&lt;ref name="NYT 2004"/&gt; Already performing as "Candis Cayne" at New York [[gay bar]] Boy Bar and as a featured performer at Tour in New York's Chelsea, the entertainer also participated in [[Wigstock]], the annual [[Drag (clothing)|drag]] festival in Manhattan's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].

In 2015, Cayne started making appearances in seasons 1 and 2 of [[Caitlyn Jenner]]'s reality show ''[[I Am Cait]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/tv/showtracker/la-et-st-i-am-cait-recap-20150803-story.html#page=1|title='I Am Cait' recap: It's all fun and games until someone calls you oblivious|author=Christie D'Zurilla|date=August 3, 2015|publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=2015-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism and personal life==

Cayne began [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] circa 1996.&lt;ref name=KITV /&gt;

Cayne has stated, "I'm not trying to be a spokeswoman for the transgender community; I just want to be looked at as a living, breathing, happy human being."&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"/&gt; She calls the [[LGBT]] community "the last great minority" and supports the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]].&lt;ref name="Advocate 2009-03"/&gt;

In August 2015 Candis Cayne teamed up with the global LGBT social network [[Moovz|MOOVZ]] as the new global creative director.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Is Caitlyn Jenner's Friend Candis Cayne Working on Next?|url = http://www.people.com/article/caitlyn-jenner-friend-candis-cayne-teams-up-lgbt-app-moovz|accessdate = 2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For over eight years, ending in 2010, Cayne was in a relationship with DJ Marco McDermott, to whom she referred as her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://people.com/archive/dirty-sexy-moneys-candis-cayne-vol-68-no-19/|title=Dirty Sexy Money’s Candis Cayne – Vol. 68 No. 19|date=2007-11-05|newspaper=PEOPLE.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Caitlyn Jenner Rumored To Be Dating Trans Actress Candis Cayne|url = http://www.newnownext.com/caitlyn-jenner-rumored-to-be-dating-trans-actress-candis-cayne/07/2015/|accessdate = 2015-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; During that time, she helped raise McDermott's daughter, Satori, from a previous relationship.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4450">A '''Control Loading System''' ('''CLS''', also known as '''Electric Control Loading'''), is used to provide pilots with realistic [[flight control]] forces in a [[flight simulator]] or training device.  These are used in both commercial and military training applications.

== History ==

The history of control loading systems starts with the history of flight simulation.  The first flight simulator was the [[Link Trainer]], also known as the Blue Box.  This was developed in the 1920s and used pumps, valves and bellows to provide the flight control forces.  The next development in control loading systems was the use of [[hydraulic actuators]] to provide the forces required on the flight controls.  These were utilized for around 20 years in the simulator industry until the development of [[electric actuators]].

== Control Loading Systems ==

=== Design and Technology ===
The main concept is to provide forces to the pilot using an actuator (hydraulic or electric).  The approach used in high fidelity applications is to connect this actuator via a linkage to the pilot controls.  The actuator is then controlled with a servo controller to control the torque or current of the motor.  An outer-loop control then controls the torque provided to the pilot using a control loop around a force sensor.

The control loading system must take in inputs from the simulator and pilot and provide outputs for the pilot and simulator.  Inputs are application of force and aircraft states and outputs are flight control position and forces.
An aircraft with reversible controls needs to have all of the complex components modeled within the control loading system.  These include cables, rods, aero forces from the control surface, centering springs and trim actuators.  As the control system gets more complicated they have to simulate effects such as bob-weights and feel units.  [[Fly-by-wire]] systems are disconnected from the control surfaces and so do not need the complex features but add other functionality which is simulated.
The high fidelity architecture has centralized control, individual analog signals to the control module, a brushless DC motor with low gear ratio and linkages to the pilot controls.
The modular designs have localized control and digital reporting over a [[field bus]] to the central control module.  The control loading systems are designed to allow situating the actuators closer to the pilot. This is necessary for mission training systems&lt;ref name="RAeS Paper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wittenstein-us.com/tech-support/resources/documents/Control_Loading_for_Mission_Training_Devices.pdf|title=Control Loading System Developments related to Mission Training Systems  |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be easily deployed and moved around the world.

Control Loading Systems are similar in design to active sidesticks. These provide cues to pilots during the flight via actuation systems. Some examples of active sidesticks used in aircraft are for the [[F-35 Lightning II]] and the [[T-50 Golden Eagle]] jet trainer developed by KAI in partnership with Lockheed Martin Corporation.

=== Standards and Regulations ===
The regulations governing control loading systems for civil simulators are the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] regulations in North America and EASA (formerly JAA) in Europe.  The FAA documents are AC 120-40B for airplane simulator qualification, Advisory circular 120-45A for Airplane Flight Training Device Qualification and AC 120-63 for helicopter Simulator Qualification.  The EASA regulations are similar to the FAR's.
Between 2006 and 2008 the International Working Group&lt;ref name="RAeS IWG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raes-fsg.org.uk/|title=Royal Aeronautical Society Flight simulation Group Webpage  |accessdate=2009-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the RAeS's Flight Simulation Group met on several occasions to redefine the standards applicable to flight simulation.  This resulted in the release of a draft standards document to [[ICAO]].  This will be released by ICAO in 2009 and at this time the FAA and EASA should incorporate this into the regulations.  The changes behind the standards will define different levels of simulator training devices which define what training requirements can be trained on with particular levels of simulators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8433">A '''criterion-referenced test''' is a style of test which uses [[Test (student assessment)|test]] scores to generate a statement about the [[behavior]] that can be expected of a person with that score.  Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests.  In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material. Criterion-referenced assessment can be contrasted with [[norm-referenced assessment]] and [[ipsative assessment]].

Criterion-referenced testing was a major focus of [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] research in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weiss | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Davison | first2 = M.L. | year = 1981 | title = Test Theory and Methods | url = | journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = | page = 1 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.32.020181.003213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition of ''criterion''==

A common misunderstanding regarding the term is the meaning of ''criterion''.  Many, if not most, criterion-referenced tests involve a [[cutscore]], where the examinee passes if their score exceeds the cutscore and fails if it does not (often called a mastery test).  The ''criterion'' is not the cutscore; the criterion is the domain of subject matter that the test is designed to assess.  For example, the criterion may be "Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers," and the cutscore may be that students should correctly answer a minimum of 80% of the questions to pass.

The criterion-referenced interpretation of a test score identifies the relationship to the subject matter.  In the case of a mastery test, this does mean identifying whether the examinee has "mastered" a specified level of the subject matter by comparing their score to the cutscore.  However, not all criterion-referenced tests have a cutscore, and the score can simply refer to a person's standing on the subject domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.questionmark.com/us/glossary.htm] QuestionMark Glossary&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[ACT (test)|ACT]] is an example of this; there is no cutscore, it simply is an assessment of the student's knowledge of high-school level subject matter.

Because of this common misunderstanding, criterion-referenced tests have also been called [[standards-based assessment]]s by some education agencies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apapdc.edu.au/archive/ASPA/conference2000/papers/art_3_9.htm Assessing the Assessment of Outcomes Based Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829075106/http://www.apapdc.edu.au/archive/ASPA/conference2000/papers/art_3_9.htm |date=2006-08-29 }} by Dr Malcolm Venter. Cape Town, South Africa. "OBE advocates a criterion-based system, which means getting rid of the bell curve, phasing out grade point averages and comparative grading".&lt;/ref&gt; as students are assessed with regards to standards that define what they "should" know, as defined by the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.home-school.com/exclusive/standards.html Homeschool World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906101322/http://www.home-school.com/exclusive/standards.html |date=2006-09-06 }}: "The Education Standards Movement Spells Trouble for Private and Home Schools"&lt;/ref&gt;

Both terms ''criterion-referenced'' and ''norm-referenced'' were originally coined by [[Robert Glaser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaser | first1 = R. | year = 1963 | title = Instructional technology and the measurement of learning outcomes | url = | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 18 | issue = 8| pages = 519–522 | doi = 10.1037/h0049294 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a criterion-reference test, a [[norm-referenced test]] indicates whether the test-taker did better or worse than other people who took the test.
For example, if the criterion is "Students should be able to correctly add two single-digit numbers," then reasonable test questions might look like "&lt;math&gt;2+3 = ?&lt;/math&gt;" or "&lt;math&gt;9+5 = ?&lt;/math&gt;"  A criterion-referenced test would report the student's performance strictly according to whether the individual student correctly answered these questions. A norm-referenced test would report primarily whether this student correctly answered more questions compared to other students in the group.
Even when testing similar topics, a test which is designed to accurately assess mastery may use different questions than one which is intended to show relative [[ranking]]. This is because some questions are better at reflecting actual achievement of students, and some test questions are better at differentiating between the best students and the worst students. (Many questions will do both.)  A criterion-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by students who know the specific material. A norm-referenced test will use questions which were correctly answered by the "best" students and not correctly answered by the "worst" students (e.g. Cambridge University's pre-entry 'S' paper).
Some tests can provide useful information about both actual achievement and relative ranking. The [[ACT (test)|ACT]] provides both a ranking, and indication of what level is considered necessary to likely success in college.&lt;ref&gt;Cronbach, L. J. (1970). ''Essentials of psychological testing'' (3rd ed.). New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the term "criterion-referenced test" is a misnomer, since it can refer to the ''interpretation'' of the score as well as the test itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Haertel | first1 = E. | year = 1985 | title = Construct validity and criterion-referenced testing | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 55 | issue = 1| pages = 23–46 | doi=10.3102/00346543055001023}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous example, the same score on the ACT can be interpreted in a norm-referenced or criterion-referenced manner.

==Relationship to high-stakes testing==
Many high-profile criterion-referenced tests are also [[high-stakes test]]s, where the results of the test have important implications for the individual examinee.  Examples of this include [[high school graduation examination]]s and licensure testing where the test must be passed to work in a profession, such as to become a physician or attorney.  However, being a high-stakes test is not specifically a feature of a criterion-referenced test.  It is instead a feature of how an educational or government agency chooses to use the results of the test.

==Examples==
* [[Driving test]]s are criterion-referenced tests, because their goal is to see whether the test taker is skilled enough to be granted a driver's license, not to see whether one test taker is more skilled than another test taker.
* [[:Category:Citizenship tests|Citizenship tests]] are usually criterion-referenced tests, because their goal is to see whether the test taker is sufficiently familiar with the new country's history and government, not to see whether one test taker is more knowledgeable than another test taker.

==Background==

Cruz Garcia was born on 27 June 1983 in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cruz "Pensa" Garcia (born 1958) and Lourdes Santiago (born 1959). His father is an international athletic coach and physical trainer.  Cruz "Pensa" Garcia trained several Olympic athletes and world boxing champions. Boxers trained by Cruz "Pensa" Garcia include Puerto Rican [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Felix Trinidad]], retired former champion [[Alex Sánchez (boxer)|Alex Sanchez]], and Argentinean former world champion [[Marcos Maidana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rafael, Dan|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/10078707/oscar-de-la-hoya-headlines-2014-boxing-hall-class  |title=De La Hoya in 2014 Class|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date= 4 December 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Primera Hora|url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/afilaocomonavaja-147787/  |title=Afila'o Como Navaja |publisher=''Primera Hora''|date= 16 January 2008|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morilla, Diego|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7008688/win-cost|title=Maidana: I Have to Win at All Cost|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date= 16 January 2008|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of a family of athletes and coaches, Cruz and his brother Manuel Garcia (an international runner and CAC Junior Champion), were track and field athletes and trained alongside world class athletes and boxing champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponce Ruiz, Luis|url=http://revistacruce.com/politica-sociedad/cruce-y-cruz-entrevista-en-tres-partes-al-arq-cruz-garcia-parte-2.html|title=Cruce y Cruz: Entrevista en Tres Partes al Arq.

A crucial point in Cruz Garcia's studies happened in 2008, during Felix Trinidad's last fight as a professional boxer. In his fight versus former world champion [[Roy Jones Jr.]], Trinidad brought Garcia as part of his training team to New York in order for him to complete his research on Narrative Architectures with pieces exposed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponce Ruiz, Luis |url=http://revistacruce.com/politica-sociedad/cruce-y-cruz-entrevista-en-tres-partes-al-arq-cruz-garcia-parte-3.html |title=Cruce y Cruz: Entrevista en Tres Partes al Arq.

== Career==

After receiving a master's degree in Architecture from the [[University of Puerto Rico]], Cruz Garcia moved from Puerto Rico to Brussels, Belgium, where he founded WAI Architecture Think Tank with Nathalie Frankowski. Also during 2008, Cruz Garcia and Nathalie Frankowski started collaborating on the art collective [[Garcia Frankowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alvarez, Paula|url= http://book-a.net/booka/islasformastexto/updates/60?lang=en|title=On Manifestos, form, criticism and autonomy: Interview with Garcia Frankowski|publisher=''Book-A.net''|date= 5 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alvarez, Paula|url= http://arqa.com/actualidad/entrevistas/entrevista-a-garcia-frankowski-manifiestos-formas-critica-y-autonomia.html|title=Entrevista a Garcia Frankowski: Formas Critica y Autonomia|publisher=''Arqa''|date= 26 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 both WAI and Garcia Frankowski operate mainly from Beijing making international publications, exhibitions, writings, and architectural projects from the Chinese capital.

Cruz Garcia is the co-editor-in-chief of What About It? an independent architecture and urbanism magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cormier, Brendan|url= http://popupcity.net/diy-publishing-an-interview-with-what-about-it/|title=DIY Publishing: An Interview with What About It?|publisher=''The Popup City''|date= 17 March 2011|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cruz Garcia and Nathalie Frankowski designed and published the book Pure Hardcore Icons: A Manifesto on Pure Form in Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | author =Cruz Garcia, Nathalie Frankowski
  | title = Pure Hardcore Icons: A Manifesto on Pure Form in Architecture

. The close relations and collaborations between the center and joint [[companies]] in the industry provide the [[motto]] for the center "the industry's academy". 

During the years prior to the establishment of the center [[statistics]] have shown a decline in the number of [[graduates]] from the [[computer science]] and [[management information systems]] disciplines in [[higher education]] [[institutes]] in [[Israel]]{{fact|date=January 2013}}, which implied a growing demand for academically educated [[workforce|manpower]] in the high tech and IT industries.  At the same time it is noted that a significant amount of high tech [[employees]] in Israel who do not hold a relevant [[professional qualification]] encounter a [[glass ceiling]] on their way up to more senior positions. Dan Academic Center was created with the purpose of generating a [[workforce]] that maintains both a relevant academic qualification and cutting edge practical knowledge that would meet the needs of the industry.  The center has defined its [[mission statement]] as to provide the next generation of [[professionals]] in the high tech industry in Israel.

==Academia-Industry collaboration==
===Networking===
The [[students]] in Dan Academic Center combine work and study. They work in high tech organizations, companies and IT units. The center provides experienced employees with the opportunity to acquire an academic qualification and thereby to increase their chances to get promoted to senior positions in the organizations they already work in. For [[freshmen]] the center has created ''Dan Works'', a [[business networking]] platform in order to refer them for [[employment]] in the joint companies. These companies hire the students for work so that in [[graduation]] they would have gained relevant practical experience. This helps the students through their study years to make a connection between theory and practice, to get to know professionals in their fields, and to increase their chances for employment in the high tech industry after graduation.

===Advisory Board===
The center's academic activity and [[curricula]] are developed, among other criteria, according to the industry's needs so as to provide the students with both the theoretical and practical knowledge required. This scheme is directed by an [[advisory board]] that consists of executives and entrepreneurs from the joint companies, to include [[Matrix (Company)|Matrix]], [[John Bryce Training]], [[Cisco]], [[Comverse]], [[Intel]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Microsoft]], [[Cellcom (Israel)|Cellcom]], [[Nokia Siemens Networks]], [[Amdocs]], [[Orbotech]], [[013 Netvision]], [[BMC Software]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[IBM]] and [[EMC Corporation|EMC]].

Several [[committees]] in the advisory board are responsible to advance certain subject areas in the center to include academic [[research]] according to industry's needs, integration of industry related contents into academic curricula, local [[high school]] academy partnership, [[career development]] and social involvement.

===Special Events===
The center holds special events to include [[lectures]] and [[academic conferences|conferences]]. The ''coffee, technology and academy'' lectures are intended for registered and prospective students and are given by executives and top professionals from the joint companies. Through these lectures the students are informed about current and future trends in the high tech industry, and prospective students get the chance to learn more about the center and its collaboration with the industry. The joint companies may organize conferences in the center on various topics.

==Departments==
Dan Academic center is accredited by the [[Council for Higher Education in Israel]] to teach for the following degrees.

* [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Computer Science]]
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Management Information Systems]]
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Business Administration]]

During their study years the students are offered to work and manage [[projects]] in the joint companies, to take [[course (education)|elective courses]] by which to focus on subjects they want to intern in and to take [[course (education)|courses]] from other departments. The students can also collaborate with one another on a project. In their third year of study they are required to conduct a [[practicum]] in one of the joint companies, for which they are instructed both by the center and the relevant company.

'''Eliot Feld''' (born July 5, 1942) is an American modern ballet choreographer, performer, teacher, and director. Feld works in an atmosphere between [[modern dance]] and [[classical ballet]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} His company and schools, including the [[Feld Ballet]] and [[Ballet Tech]], are deeply committed to dance and dance education in [[New York City]].

Feld has choreographed nearly 150 ballets since 1967, with his work being performed by such companies as [[American Ballet Theatre]], the [[Joffrey Ballet]], the [[Juilliard School]], [[New York City Ballet]], the [[New York City Opera]], and [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], among many others.

==Life and career==
Feld was born in [[Brooklyn, New York]],&lt;ref name=Kourlas /&gt; the son of Alice (née Posner), a travel agent, and Benjamin Noah Feld, an attorney.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Block|first=Maxine|authorlink=|author2=Anna Herthe Rothe |author3=Charles Moritz |title= Current Biography Yearbook|publisher=H.W. Wilson Company|year=1971|location=|pages=126|url=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Polner|first=Murray|authorlink=|title= American Jewish Biographies|publisher=Facts on File, inc.|year=1982|location=|pages=105|url=|isbn=0871964627}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feld attended the [[High School of Performing Arts]] in New York, and studied at the [[School of American Ballet]] and the [[New Dance Group]], as well as with &lt;!-- NO EVIDENCE OF THIS [[Martha Graham]],--&gt; [[Richard Thomas (dancer)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Donald McKayle]].

He performed as a child in [[George Balanchine]]'s original production of ''[[The Nutcracker]]'' as the Nutcracker Prince;&lt;ref name=Kourlas /&gt; and later with the companies of Mary Anthony, [[Pearl Lang]], and [[Sophie Maslow]]. At sixteen he appeared on Broadway in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and was cast as Baby John in the [[West Side Story (film)|movie version of the musical]];&lt;ref name=Kourlas /&gt; during the filming of "Cool" (one of the hardest dances in the film), Feld was sick with [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} His other Broadway credits from this period include  ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]'' and ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]''.

He appeared on television on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.

Later, Feld joined [[American Ballet Theatre]], leaving at age 25 to form his own company.

In the early 1980s, with Cora Cahan, Feld founded the [[Joyce Theater]] as a home for the Feld Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Kisselgoff | first=Anna | title=Creating A Theater Just for Dance | newspaper=New York Times | date=1981-07-26 | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EFD9163BF935A15754C0A967948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | accessdate=2008-05-04 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson, Jack. [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/05/30/arts/dance-view-the-feld-christens-its-new-home.html "DANCE VIEW; THE FELD CHRISTENS ITS NEW HOME,"] ''New York Times'' (May 30, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;  Feld was also instrumental in the creation of the Lawrence A. Wien Center for Dance &amp; Theater at 890 Broadway in New York.

== Feld's companies and schools ==
In 1967, at the age of twenty-five, Feld broke away from the American Ballet Theatre to form his own company, the '''American Ballet Company'''. Feld used his new company, later known simply as '''Feld Ballet''', to explore a variety of dance genres.

In 1978, Feld began a ballet school, the '''New Ballet School'''. Feld believed that all children should have the opportunity to learn dance, regardless of their family income. In keeping with that philosophy, and in partnership with the [[New York City Board of Education]], he auditioned more than 1,500 children at eight New York City public schools; almost 150 students were then enrolled, tuition-free, to a 17-week course at the New Ballet School. Additional dancers at the school were drawn from other troupes and academies. Since its 1978 founding, Feld's school has auditioned 827,655 New York City public school students, and provided classes for 20,976 children.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In 1996 the school changed its name to the '''New York City Public School for Dance'''.

In 1997, Feld merged his school and the Feld Ballet into '''Ballet Tech''', providing a unified organization, and establishing a professional performing outlet for the school's graduates. In 2003, Feld disbanded the Feld Ballet to focus on his schools.&lt;ref name=Kourlas&gt;Kourlas, Gia. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/arts/dance/eliot-felds-ballet-tech-program-is-expanding.html?_r=0 "A School for Young Dancers Grows Up: Eliot Feld’s Ballet Tech Program Is Expanding,"] ''New York Times'' (JUNE 12, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Ballet Tech’s activities include the tuition-free New York City Public School for Dance, and '''Kids Dance''', a pre-professional children’s group.&lt;ref name=Kourlas /&gt;

== Choreography ==
Feld has choreographed 147 ballets since 1967, with his work being performed by the American Ballet Company, [[American Ballet Theatre]], the [[Atlanta Ballet]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], Feld Ballets/NY &amp; Ballet Tech &amp; Kids Dance, the [[Boston Ballet]], the Joffrey Ballet, the [[John Curry]] Skating Company, the [[Juilliard School]], the [[London Festival Ballet]], the [[National Ballet of Canada]], the [[New York City Ballet]], the [[New York City Opera]], the [[Pacific Northwest Ballet]], the Richmond Ballet, the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], the [[Royal Swedish Ballet]], the [[Royal Winnipeg Ballet]], and the [[San Francisco Ballet]], among others.

Feld’s choreography also appeared in the revival of the Broadway musical ''[[On the Town (musical)|On the Town]]'' (2001), performed in [[Central Park]]. In place of the company’s usual summer engagement at the [[Joyce Theater]], Feld included several of his own dancers of the Ballet Tech company.

Feld uses aspects from ballet and modern dance and fuses them together in his work. "The down of one, the up of the other — both beauties attracted me, I think I've spent my choreographic life trying in some way to reconcile, cope, deal with these two elements."{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} He claims to have always "loved the [[pointe shoe]]."

Feld's works are varied and contain anything from off-beat music to [[aerobic exercises]], including somersaults, push-ups, sprints, leaps, and calisthenics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Nancy|authorlink=|author2=Malcolm McCormick|title=No Fixed Points Dance in the Twentieth Century|year=2003|location=|pages=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; His choreography was inspired by [[Jewish]] material, along with the influence of [[Martha Graham]].

''A Yankee Doodle'', Feld's most recent ballet, premiered in New York on June 11, 2015; it  was choreographed for 13 kids from the Ballet Tech school, to American fife &amp; drum music.

'''Ernst Sieper''' was a German [[English studies|Anglicist]].
*From 1890 to 1895 he was employed as Elementary school teacher. 
*From 1896 to 1898 he studied and researched in England.
* in summer semester 1898 habilitated from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].
*Wintersemester 1904, 1905 became extraordinary Professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].

== Publications ==
*His most important contribution to science was his scholarly edition of [[John Lydgate]]'s "Reason and Sensuality" (Early Engl. Text. Soc., Extra Ser. 84, 1901). 
*He also edited "Les echecs amoureux," an old French allegory in the style of the "Roman de la Rose," and the source of Lydgate's poem (Weimar, 1898). 
Soon, however, Professor Sieper's interest was directed towards the modern period of English literature, and he devoted himself to the study of the aesthetic movement in the Romantic and the Victorian age. The fruits of his researches in this 
never foresook the cause he had espoused. In numerous newspaper articles he pleaded for fair play and reacted against the vagaries of chauvinism. It was his sacred conviction that an ultimate adjustment of the conflicting political interests of England and Germany was possible, and that it ought to be prepared by intellectual and social cooperation. And no doubt, had Professor Sieper lived to see the conclusion of peace, his influence would have contributed in a large measure to
Intellectual and social cooperation. And no doubt had Professor Sieper lived to see the conclusion of peace, his influence would have contributed to a large measure to quiet the chauinists on both sides of the Channel, at least in the république des letrees.
*On January 6, 1916 he died at Munich, Germany, as professor of English literature and philology at the University of Munich.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Fischer, Privatdozent für englische Philologie [[University of Würzburg]] für die Dauer des Krieges an die Universität Gent berufen.

Plans for the establishment of JKCAT started in 1977. In early 1978, the Kenyan president, [[Jomo Kenyatta]], donated 200 hectares of farmland for the establishment of the college. The first group of students were admitted on 4 May 1981. The new president [[Daniel Arap Moi]] formally opened JKUAT on 17 March 1982.

The first graduation ceremony was held in April 1984 with diploma certificates presented to graduates in [[agricultural engineering]], [[food technology]] and [[horticulture]]. On 1 September 1988, Moi declared JKUAT a constituent College of [[Kenyatta University]] through a legal notice, under the Kenyatta University Act (CAP 210C). The name of JKUAT officially changed to Jomo Kenyatta University College of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). It was finally established as a university through the JKUAT Act, 1994 and inaugurated on 7 December 1994.

{{refimprove|date=March 2010}}

'''The Kafka Project''' is a non-profit literary research initiative founded in 1998 at [[San Diego State University]]. Working on behalf of the Kafka estate in London, England, the SDSU Kafka Project is working to recover materials written by [[Franz Kafka]], the widely acclaimed [[modernist]] author, stolen by the [[Gestapo]] in 1933. The search continues in Eastern Europe and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/literatur/Franz-Kafka;art138,3012019.html Reiner Stach in Der Tagesspiegel]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SDSU Kafka Project, headed by SDSU adjunct professor and biographer Kathi Diamant, with an international board of advisors, is searching for Kafka's notebooks and letters written in correspondence to [[Dora Diamant]], his lover at the time of his death in 1924, as well as Dora's correspondence with Kafka's friend, literary executor and first biographer [[Max Brod]]. Kafka's missing writings consist of 35 letters written to Dora Diamant between 1923–1924 and up to 20 notebooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2017/02/04/unraveling-a-nazi-mystery-are-franz-kafka-s-missing-love-letters-in-berlin|title=Unraveling a Nazi Mystery: Are Franz Kafka’s Missing Love Letters in Berlin?|last=McNearney|first=Allison|date=2017-02-04|website=The Daily Beast|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; representing the last year of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/05/AR2010010503604.html | accessdate = 25 March 2010 | work=The Washington Post | first=Howard | last=Schneider | title=In Israel, a tangled battle over the papers of Franz Kafka | date=6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The contents of these letters and notebooks is unknown and has never been published. The 70 letters that Dora wrote to Max Brod between 1924-1952 are amongst the hotly contested Brod Collection.&lt;ref&gt;Aderet, Ofer [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1118231.html "A Friend of Kafka"], ''[[Haaretz]]'', Tel Aviv, 8 October 2009. Retrieved on 2010-3-21.&lt;/ref&gt; Dora Diamant's letters to Max Brod contain information to further identify the missing materials&lt;ref&gt;Bloomberg.com Kafka's Trial Comes to Life in Court Battle Over His Papers [https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=email_en&amp;sid=afg.2hT.7EZU]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Kafka requested that all his extant writings be destroyed, however, Dora, following Kafka's express wish that his writings be burned, secretly kept them in her [[Berlin]] home. Following the [[Nazi]] takeover in 1933, the [[Gestapo]] ransacked her Berlin flat and confiscated every piece of paper, looking for Communist propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Diamant, Kathi (2003). ''Kafka's Last Love'', p. 183. Basic Books, New York. {{ISBN|0-465-01550-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1930s, Dora and her husband, [[Lutz Lask]], were members of the [[Communist Party of Germany|KPD]] and Lask was the editor of the illegal Communist organ, "[[Die Rote Fahne]]." After the theft of her secret Kafka treasure, Dora contacted Max Brod to beg that he rescue the materials. Brod was told that the mountainous stacks of papers confiscated in the early days of Nazi rule made it impossible to recover at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Pawel, Ernst (1984). "The Nightmare of Reason", p. 438. Farrar, Straus, Giroux, New York. {{ISBN|0-374-22236-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, Brod, now living in [[Tel Aviv]], worked with Kafka scholar and biographer [[Klaus Wagenbach]] to attempt recovery of Kafka's lost writings. However, their search ended at the [[Iron Curtain]] when the Berlin Chief of Police informed them Kafka's papers were most likely amongst confiscated materials taken out of Berlin in a train transport during the Allied bombing for safekeeping in [[Silesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources: Kafka, by Nicolas Murray, pages 367, 374; "Summary of the Results of the Kafka Project Berlin Research 1 June – September 1998" published in December 1998 Kafka Katern, quarterly of the Kafka Circle of the Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kafka Project has conducted two extensive research projects, in 1998 in the German archives&lt;ref&gt;Thomas,Gina,"Kafkas Geliebte" ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'', 17 August 1999, Nr. 189/Page 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 in Poland. The Kafka Project has been responsible for the discoveries of three original Kafka letters, Dora Diamant's missing diaries and letters, and the only extant personal possession of Kafka, his hairbrush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookthink.com/0053/53dia2.htm BookThink interview with Kathi Diamant]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.kafkaproject.com/discoveries.html "also found in Kafka Project Discoveries"], ''[[Kafka Project]]''.  The Project has been supported by the Hadassah Research Institute [[Brandeis University]], the Weingart Foundation, the Ludwig Vogelstein Foundation, [[Hedgebrook]], and individual donors. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Planetarium computer software ==

{{see also|Planetarium software}}

Since the invention of the [[personal computer]], the planetarium concept has been extended to include [[software]] that displays a realistic sky image.  Not all astronomy software can be considered to be planetarium software.  While there is no generally accepted definition of the word ''planetarium'' in this context, planetarium software generally contains the following features at a minimum:

*A realistic sky image as seen from Earth
*The ability to display sky motions in real-time
*The ability to animate time changes backwards and forwards

==Planetarium manufacturers==
The list below gives the name of firms that have made more than five planetariums, with state they are located in if in the United States, otherwise, the nation.  Included are the names of the various models offered by each firm, and an approximate total number sold for each firm. The symbol D after the total indicates the firm is no longer in business or no longer making planetariums.

'''Little Golden Books''' is a popular series of [[children's books]]. The eighth book in the series, ''[[The Poky Little Puppy]]'', is the top-selling children's book of all time.&lt;ref name=PW-Roback&gt;Diane Roback, editor; compiled by Debbie Hochman Turvey. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-industry-news/article/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books.html "All-Time Bestselling Children's Books: A listing of hardcovers that have sold 750,000 copies and paperbacks that have topped the one million copy mark over the years,"] ''Publishers Weekly'' (Dec 17, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Little Golden Books have become bestsellers,&lt;ref name=PW-Roback /&gt; including ''The Poky Little Puppy'', ''[[Tootle]]'', ''[[Scuffy the Tugboat]]'', and ''[[The Little Red Hen]]''. Several of the illustrators for the Little Golden Books later became staples within the picture book industry, including [[Corinne Malvern]], [[Tibor Gergely]], [[Gustaf Tenggren]], [[Feodor Rojankovsky]], [[Richard Scarry]], [[Eloise Wilkin]], and [[Garth Williams]].

Many books in the Little Golden Books series deal with [[nature]] and [[science]], [[Bible]] stories, [[nursery rhyme]]s, and [[fairy tales]]. [[Christmas]] titles are published every year. Some Little Golden Books and related products have featured children's characters from other media, e.g. ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[The Muppets]]'', [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', ''[[Barbie]]'', ''[[Power Rangers]]'', etc.  Television and movie tie-ins have been particularly popular. Over the years [[Hopalong Cassidy]], [[Cheyenne]], [[Lassie]], [[Rin Tin Tin]], [[Captain Kangaroo]], [[Mister Rogers]], and even [[Donny Osmond|Donny]] and [[Marie Osmond]] have appeared in Little Golden Books. That many old titles remain in print shows the strong [[nostalgia]] appeal of the series.

The series originated with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]; [[Western Publishing|Western Printing and Lithographing Company]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]] was Simon &amp; Schuster's partner in the Little Golden Books venture, with Western handling the actual printing. Ownership and control of the series has changed several times since; Little Golden Books are currently published by [[Penguin Random House]].

Although the details have changed over the years, the Little Golden Books have maintained a distinctive appearance.  A copy of ''The Poky Little Puppy'' bought today is essentially the same as one printed in 1942. Both are readily recognizable as Little Golden Books.  At the time of the series' [[golden anniversary]] in 1992, Golden Books claimed that a billion and a half Little Golden Books had been sold.&lt;ref&gt;"Fifty Years of Books 'For the Masses.'" ''Publishers' Weekly''. 239 (28: 28-31). June 22, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Little Golden Books have remained the backbone of the product line, the enterprise that produced the Little Golden Books has created a variety of children's books in various formats, including records, tapes, videos, and even toys and games.  Some titles have appeared in several different formats (including "A Golden Book").

==History==
[[Image:TheLittleRedHen.png|thumb|alt=An illustrated hen wearing a shirt and hat uses a shovel to dig a hole. |''Little Red Hen'' cover]]
Little Golden Books was the brainchild of [[Georges Duplaix]], who in 1940 was head of [[Artists and Writers Guild]] Inc., a division of [[Western Publishing]] tasked with developing new children's books. Meanwhile, a shared printing plant led Western and [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] to develop a close relationship. In 1938, the first joint effort between Western and Simon &amp; Schuster, ''A Children’s History,'' was published.&lt;ref name="WPGHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Western Publishing|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/western-publishing-group-inc-history/|publisher=Funding Universe, citing ''International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 13'' ([[St. James Press]], 1996)|accessdate=August 12, 2015 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120724052813/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/western-publishing-group-inc-history/ | archivedate= July 24, 2012| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duplaix had the idea to produce a colorful, more durable and affordable children’s book than those being published at that time which sold for $2 to $3. With the help of Lucile Olge, also working at the Guild, Duplaix contacted Albert Leventhal, a vice president and sales manager at Simon &amp; Schuster, and [[Leon Shimkin]], also at Simon &amp; Schuster, with his idea.

The group decided to publish twelve titles for simultaneous release in what was to be called the Little Golden Books Series. Each book would have 42 pages, 28 printed in two-color, and 14 in four-color. The books would be staple-bound. The group originally discussed a 50-cent price for the books, but Western did not want to compete with other 50-cent books already on the market. The group calculated that if the print run for each title was 50,000 copies instead of 25,000, the books could affordably be sold for 25 cents each.

Mary Reed, Ph.D., a professor at the [[Teachers College, Columbia University]], served as initial editor of the series.

The first 12 titles were printed in September 1942 and released to stores in October:&lt;ref name="Antique"&gt;{{cite web|title=Once Upon a Time: The History of Little Golden Books |url=http://www.antiquetrader.com/features/the_history_of_little_golden_books |work=[[Antique Trader]] |first=Steve |last=Santi |date=April 29, 2009 |accessdate=August 11, 2015 |archivedate=August 14, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ambsiqk2?url=http://www.antiquetrader.com/features/the_history_of_little_golden_books |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Announcing Little Golden Books."

Three editions totaling 1.5 million books sold out within five months of publication in 1942.

[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] editor [[Dorothy A. Bennett]] also worked with Duplaix on the Little Golden Books. Bennett became the editor of the franchise, producing books by such authors and illustrators as [[Margaret Wise Brown]], [[Clement Hurd]], [[Edith Thacher Hurd]], and [[Garth Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bj2NBpv_vpsC|title=Warman's Little Golden Books Field Guide: Values and Identification|last=Santi|first=Steve|date=2005-08-05|publisher=Krause Publications|isbn=0896892654|page=19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanton|first=Joseph|date=1993-01-01|title=Review of Margaret Wise Brown: Awakened by the Moon|jstor=23539995|journal=Biography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett authored several Golden Books,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=au%3A%22Bennett%2C+Dorothy+A.%22&amp;qt=results_page|title=WorldCat, author Dorothy A.

A big boost to the series came with the involvement of [[Lucy Sprague Mitchell]], an educator and founder of [[Bank Street Nursery School]] in New York's West Village, that later became the [[Bank Street College of Education]]. A strong proponent of realistic children books, Mitchell created the Bank Street Writer’s Laboratory, whose works became the new basis for the Little Golden Book series, with characters and situations that were often inspired by the very neighborhood where the Bank School was located.

As historian [[Leonard S. Marcus]] writes,
{{quote|Mitchell had been in discussions with Georges Duplaix and Lucille Ogle as early as 1943 about the possibility of a special series of Little Golden Books written by members of Bank Street Writer’s Laboratory. Wartime shortages had delayed the launch of the series until 1946. The first two titles appeared that year: Lucy Sprague Mitchell's ''The New House in the Forest'', illustrated by Eloise Wilkins, and ''The Taxi That Hurried'', coauthored by Irma Simonton Black and Jessie Stanton, with illustrations by [[Tibor Gergely]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus, Leonard S. ''Minders of Make-Believe: Idealists, Entrepreneurs, and the Shaping of American Children's Literature'' (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1958, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] sold its interest in Little Golden Books to [[Western Publishing]]. The price of Little Golden Books rose to 29¢ in 1962.

Western introduced a line of '''Big Little Golden Books''' for slightly older children, age 5 and up. These included new stories such as ''[[The House That Had Enough]]'' and reprints such as ''[[The Monster at the End of This Book]]''.

In the 1980s, Golden Books introduced '''Golden Melody Books''' that included a long-lasting electronic chip that played music every time the book was opened. Titles included popular children's songs such as ''Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star'' and songs from children's TV and movies including'' People in Your Neighborhood'' from ''Sesame Street'' and ''Heigh Ho'' from ''Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.''

In the year 2000, Encore Software produced a series of "Little Golden Books" titles for CD ROM, including ''[[The Poky Little Puppy]]'', ''[[Mother Goose]]'', ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', ''[[The Velveteen Rabbit]]'', ''[[Tootle]]'', and ''[[The Saggy Baggy Elephant]]''.  These six individual titles were some of the first major software releases to be produced entirely in [[Macromedia Flash]]. &lt;!-- They appeared in ''[[Time Magazine]]'' as part of an article entitled "How to Raise a Superkid".--&gt;

In 2001, [[Random House]] acquired Little Golden Books for about $85 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Random House Lands Golden Book Assets." ''Publishers' Weekly''. 248(33):13&amp; 23. August 20, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, nearly 15 million copies of  ''The Poky Little Puppy'' had been sold, including copies in various languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Publishers Weekly]] |title=All-Time Bestselling Children's Books |volume=248 |issue=51 |date=December 17, 2001 |editor1-last=Roback |editor1-first=Diane |editor2-last=Britton |editor2-first=Jason |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books-.html |accessdate=June 27, 2011 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115201827/http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20011217/28595-all-time-bestselling-children-s-books-.html |archivedate=January 15, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, with the release of Little Golden Book adaptations of the first six installments of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga on August 25, the Little Golden Book adaptation of ''[[Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith]]'' became the first ever Little Golden Book in history to be based on a film that was [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|rated PG-13 by the]] [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Parrish|first1=Robin|title=Little Golden Books Are Disneyfying All 6 'Star Wars' Movies|url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/70788/20150721/little-golden-books-disneyfying-6-star-wars-movies.htm|website=TechTimes|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Months later, on April 12, 2016, a Little Golden Book adaptation of ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the next film in the saga, also rated PG-13, was released.  This opened the door for further Little Golden Books that drew upon PG-13 rated licensed film properties, such as the [[Ghostbusters (2016 film)|2016 reboot of ''Ghostbusters'']], characters and storylines from the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] and even ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Liszewski |first1=Anddrew |title=These Ghostbusters Little Golden Books Are Who Ya Gonna Call For a Bedtime Story |url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/these-ghostbusters-little-golden-books-are-who-ya-gonna-1782416286 |website=Gizmodo |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Frost |first1=AJ |title=INTERVIEW: Breaking Down &amp; Rebuilding Pop Culture Worlds with ARIE KAPLAN |url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-breaking-down-rebuilding-pop-culture-worlds-with-arie-kaplan/ |website=ComicsBeat |accessdate=16 July 2018 |date=27 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Macarthur Astronomy Forum'''  is a monthly public forum organised by [[Macarthur Astronomical Society]], providing leading national and international professional astronomers with a platform to address the Forum on topics of [[astronomical]] interest; also providing members of the Society and the general public with opportunities to learn and ask questions.

The Forums (known as the General Meetings of the Society until the new identity was adopted in February 2011) have been held (admission free) at (and with the support of) the [[Western Sydney University]] ([[Campbelltown, New South Wales|Cambelltown]] Campus), [[NSW]], [[Australia]] since the second meeting of the Society in 1996.

The first Macarthur Astronomy Forum was held on 21 February 2011, with a presentation by [[Fred Watson|Professor Fred Watson]] A.M., Astronomer-In-Charge of the Australian Astronomical Observatory, Siding Springs, NSW, Australia. The talk was entitled: "Poles Apart - The environment near a planet's poles"

The Forums are open to the general public and are held on the third Monday of each month (January to November).

==Aims==
* To bring excellence in astronomy to the [[Macarthur Region]].
* To provide a prestigious public platform for expert national and international astronomers from Australia and elsewhere to make an illustrated presentation on their individual fields of expertise.
* To foster the science of astronomy within the community.
* To bridge the divide between professional astronomy and amateur astronomy.

These astronomers are users of the world's most sophisticated optical, radio, gamma-ray orbital and ground-based telescopes, including the [[Hubble Space Telescope|Hubble]], [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]], [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes]] and the [[Australia Telescope National Facility|ATNF]] telescopes. In Lisa Harvey-Smith's case, she is also Project Scientist responsible for Australia's participation in the design of the world's largest ever radio telescope, the SKA and the commissioning of its precursor, ASKAP.

The Forum is also addressed by other experts in astronomy, such as manufacturers and retailers of leading telescope equipment; and leading [[amateur astronomers]], such as [[Anthony Wesley]] and leading members of [[Macarthur Astronomical Society]] and other Societies, to foster the science of astronomy within the community.

==Students Night==
The Forum holds Annual Students Nights on the second Monday of December, when students are invited to present their latest astronomy research projects. The inaugural Student's Night was held in December 2015,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macastro.org.au/mas/index.php/about-us/our-history&lt;/ref&gt; with students Vina Hing &amp; Linh Thuy Nguyen from [[Prairiewood High School]] presenting their research,&lt;ref&gt;http://itelescope.squarespace.com/storage/Eclipsing%20Binaries.docx&lt;/ref&gt; using iTelescope,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itelescope.net/home/2015/6/27/itelescopenet-outreach-in-action.html&lt;/ref&gt; into [[Binary star#Eclipsing binaries|eclipsing binary stars]].

Article 13, Section 11. Retrieved March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; though it was not until February 12, 1855, that Michigan [[List of Governors of Michigan|Governor]] [[Kinsley S. Bingham]] signed a bill establishing the United States' first agriculture college, the '''Agricultural College of the State of Michigan'''.&lt;ref name="sesquicentennial"&gt;"[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/articlepg1.htm Milestones of MSU's Sesquicentennial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806233601/http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/articlepg1.htm |date=August 6, 2007 }}". MSU University Archives and Historical Collection. Retrieved March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Classes began on May 13, 1857, with three buildings, five faculty members, and 63 male students.

The first president, [[Joseph R. Williams]], designed a curriculum that required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era. It balanced science, [[liberal arts]], and practical training. The curriculum excluded [[Latin language|Latin]] and Greek studies since most applicants did not study any [[classical language]]s in their rural high schools. However, it did require three hours of daily [[manual labour|manual labor]], which kept costs down for both the students and the College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Darling, Birt. | title=City in the Forest; The Story of Lansing | location=New York | publisher=Stratford House | year=1950|page=121 | lccn=50008202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Williams' innovations and his defense of education for the masses, the State Board of Education saw Williams' curriculum as [[elitism|elitist]]. They forced him to resign in 1859 and reduced the curriculum to a two-year vocational program.

=== Land Grant Pioneer ===
In 1860, Williams became acting [[lieutenant governor]]&lt;ref name="josephrwilliams"&gt;"[http://www.msu.edu/unit/msuarhc/williams.htm Joseph R.

This gave the college a four-year curriculum and the power to grant master's degrees. Under the act, a newly created body, known as the State Board of Agriculture, took over from the State Board of Education in running the institution.&lt;ref name="sesquicentennial"/&gt; The college changed its name to '''State Agricultural College''', and its first class graduated in the same year. As the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] had begun, there was no time for an elaborate graduation ceremony.  The first alumni enlisted to the [[Union Army]]. Williams died, and the following year, [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the First [[Morrill Act]] of 1862 to support similar colleges, making the Michigan school a national model.  Shortly thereafter, on March 18, 1863, the state designated the college its land-grant institution making Michigan State University one of the nation's first land-grant college.&lt;ref name=Nation&gt;{{Citation | title = The National Schools of Science | magazine = The Nation | page = 409 | date = November 21, 1867 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&amp;f=false | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160624102647/https://books.google.com/books?id=Mf0xAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA409&amp;lpg=PA409&amp;dq=land+grant+kansas+february+16,+1863+pennsylvania+April#v=onepage&amp;q=land%20grant%20kansas%20february%2016%2C%201863%20pennsylvania%20April&amp;f=false | archivedate = June 24, 2016 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college first admitted women in 1870, although at that time there were no female residence halls. The few women who enrolled boarded with faculty families or made the arduous [[stagecoach]] trek from Lansing. From the early days, female students took the same rigorous scientific agriculture courses as male students. In 1896, the faculty created a "Women Course" that melded a [[Family and consumer science|home economics]] curriculum with [[liberal arts]] and sciences. That same year, the College turned the Abbot Hall male dorm into a women's dormitory. It was not until 1899 that the State Agricultural College admitted its first African American student, William O. Thompson. After graduation, he taught at what is now [[Tuskegee University]]. President [[Jonathan L. Snyder]] invited its president [[Booker T. Washington]] to be the Class of 1900 commencement speaker. A few years later, Myrtle Craig became the first woman African-American student to enroll at the College. Along with the Class of 1907, she received her degree from U.S. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], commencement speaker for the Semi-Centennial celebration. The City of East Lansing was incorporated the same year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Miller, Whitney. | title=East Lansing: Collegeville Revisited (Images of America) | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2002 | isbn=0-7385-2045-4 | page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later the college changed its name to '''Michigan Agricultural College''' (M.A.C.).

=== Big Ten University ===
During the early 20th century, M.A.C. expanded its curriculum well beyond agriculture. By 1925 it had expanded enough it changed its name to '''Michigan State College of Agriculture and Applied Science''' (M.S.C.). In 1941, the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture, [[John A. Hannah]], became president of the College.

After World War II, he began the largest expansion in the institution's history, with the help of the 1945 [[G. I. Bill of Rights|G.I. Bill]], which helped World War II veterans gain college educations. One of Hannah's strategies was to build a new dormitory building, enroll enough students to fill it, and use the income to start construction on a new dormitory. Under his plan, enrollment increased from 15,000 in 1950 to 38,000 in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Heineman, Kenneth J. | title=Campus Wars: The Peace Movement at American State Universities in the Vietnam Era | location=New York | publisher=New York University Press | year=1993 | isbn=0-8147-3512-6|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Hannah continued MSU's expansion by co-founding Michigan State University–Oakland, now [[Oakland University]], with [[Matilda Dodge Wilson]]. Hannah also got the chance to improve the athletic reputation of M.S.C. when the [[University of Chicago]] resigned from the [[Big Ten Conference]] in 1946. Hannah lobbied to take its place, gaining admission in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=It's Big 10 Now – Spartans Admitted|newspaper=Wisconsin State Journal|date=May 21, 1949|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six years later, in its Centennial year of 1955, the State of Michigan renamed the College as '''Michigan State University of Agriculture and Applied Science'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Kuhn, Madison. | title=Michigan State: The First Hundred Years, 1855–1955 | location=East Lansing | publisher=Michigan State University Press | year=1955 | isbn=0-87013-222-9 | page=471}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine years afterward, the University governing body changed its name from the State Board of Agriculture to the MSU Board of Trustees.

Since 1964, the institution has been '''Michigan State University'''.

=== Oakland University ===
In 1957, the donation of {{convert|1500|acre|km2}} in Pontiac Township, Oakland County, Michigan prompted creation of Michigan State University – Oakland.  That campus became the independent school, [[Oakland University]], in 1970.&lt;ref name="Oakland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&amp;sid=19|title=Oakland's History|publisher=Oakland University|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120716202800/http://www.oakland.edu/?id=1611&amp;sid=19|archivedate=July 16, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global Leadership Initiative, 2012 and Beyond ===
Since the end of the Hannah era in 1969, Michigan State shifted its focus from increasing the size of its student body to advancing its national and global reputation. In September 2005, president [[Lou Anna Simon]] called for MSU to become the global model leader for Land Grant institutions by 2012. Her plans included creating a new [[residential college]] and increased grants awarded from the [[National Institutes of Health]] past the US$100 million mark. While there are over 100 [[Land-grant universities]] in the United States, she stated she would like Michigan State University to be the leader.&lt;ref&gt;Darrow, Bob.

In 2016, a police report was filed alleging that in 2000, [[USA Gymnastics]] team doctor and MSU sports physician [[Larry Nassar]] (also a professor in the College of Osteopathic Medicine) had sexually assaulted a minor named [[Rachael Denhollander]] under the guise of medical treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wehpkiflXMs|title=Watch: Nassar victim Rachael Denhollander speaks out|first=|last=USA TODAY Sports|date=January 24, 2018|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The allegation led to the arrest and eventual conviction of Nassar.

==== Big Ten Academic Alliance ====
Michigan State University is a participant in the [[Big Ten Academic Alliance]]. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the [[Big Ten Conference]]. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014–2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/library/reciprocal-borrowing/introduction |title=Reciprocal Library Borrowing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/projects/purchasing-and-licensing |title=Purchasing and Licensing |publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance |date= |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course sharing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/SharedCourses.aspx|title=Sharing Access to Courses|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[professional development]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/Leadership.aspx|title=Leadership Development|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[study abroad]] and international collaborations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btaa.org/Home/Projects/GlobalCollaborations.aspx|title=Global Collaborations|publisher=Big Ten Academic Alliance|accessdate=June 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

=== Endowment ===
MSU's (private, non-Morrill Act) [[financial endowment|endowment]] started in 1916 when the Engineering Building burned down. Automobile magnate [[R.E. Olds]] helped the program stay afloat with a gift of $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rodriguez, Michael | title=R.E. Olds and Industrial Lansing | location=Charleston, South Carolina | publisher=Arcadia Publishing | year=2004 | isbn=0-7385-3272-X | page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was a time when MSU lagged behind peer institutions in terms of endowments. As recently as the early 1990s, MSU was last among the eleven Big Ten schools (of the time), with barely over $100 million in endowment funds.

This changed dramatically in the 2000s (decade), when the University started a campaign to increase the size of the endowment. At the close of [[fiscal year]] 2004–2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school.&lt;ref&gt;Seguin, Rick. "[http://newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html Endowment surges in growth, rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902172725/http://www.newsbulletin.msu.edu/jan2606/endowment.html |date=September 2, 2006 }}".

:''This article refers to the text-based online role-playing game. '''[[Micromuse]]''' was also formerly used as the name of a company which was acquired by [[IBM]] in 2005.''
'''''MicroMUSE''''' is a [[MUD]] started in 1990. It is based on the [[TinyMUSE]] system, which allows members to interact in a [[virtual environment]] called Cyberion City, as well as to create objects and modify their environment.  MicroMUSE was conceived as an environment to allow people in far-flung locations to interact with each other, particularly college students with Internet access.  A core group of users remain active today.

==History==

===1990===
MicroMUSE was founded as MicroMUSH by the user known as "Jin" in the summer of 1990.  Based upon [[TinyMUSH]], MicroMUSH was centered around Cyberion City, a space station orbiting earth of the 24th century.  The initial MicroMUSH database was largely due to the efforts of Jin and the Wizards who went by the online aliases "Trout_Complex", "Coyote", "Opera_Ghost", "Snooze", "Wai", "Star" and "Mama.Bear".  [[Larry Foard|Larry "Leet" Foard]] and "Bard" (later known as "Michael") were, along with Jin, the primary programmers.&lt;ref name="charter94"&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.musenet.info:8080/~ender/charter.94
 | title = MicroMUSE Charter
 | publisher = MuseNet
 | year = 1994
 | accessdate = 2010-04-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus, at the time, primarily was communication and creativity.  Users were encouraged to build "objects" and were given extensive leeway to create and communicate with other members.  At times, it could be compared to a high-tech version of the wild west.

===1991===
Typical problems of growth and success, over time, led to issues with computing resources.  In April 1991, MicroMUSH moved to MIT.  The name was officially changed to MicroMUSE during this same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | last = Brown | first = Carl
 | url = http://www.musenet.info:8080/~ender/history
 | title = Final Version of Early MUSE History
 | publisher = MuseNet
 | date = 1992-10-10
 | accessdate = 2010-04-22
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992===
Through 1992, the focus of MicroMUSE continued to change, though not very noticeably to existing users.  New users were given a smaller "quota" of object which they could build. The game was extremely popular at this point.  One could log in at almost any time of day, and find at least thirty active people.

===1993===
By the end of 1993, the space engine, which had been developed within the original theme of MicroMUSE, was moved out of MicroMUSE. The focus was shifting; it became less about creativity and communication between random people across the internet, and more about bringing in primary-school children.  The "quota" of objects was reduced, for all players, from as much as 100, down to 10 "objects". The game became more-heavily censored, as some of the leadership began to push a K-12-friendly environment throughout the game.  Long-time users who did not like the change, and spoke out against it, were often banned from the game altogether.

===1994===
By the end of 1994, any semblance of what MicroMUSE had been was almost gone. A charter and bylaws were created, which officially changed the focus of MicroMUSE.  The second developer had left the project, and Frnkzk became the head developer of MicroMUSE.  The guidance of a "mentor" was required for anyone not pre-screened by the administration.  By this point, the focus was solely education.

===post-1994===
The changes in focus and game policies, along with changing technology, caused a gradual decline in the number of core members using MicroMUSE.

==Counter-Movement==
As the game changed drastically, in 1993 and 1994, very disorganized counter-movement began. There was no leader, and there were varying tactics.

===Attacks on MicroMUSE===
There were attacks on MicroMUSE, which would cause it to crash, by exploiting poorly written routines. Generally, these would either cause a buffer-overflow, or would cause an infinite loop. The attacks were usually carried out by users who had been removed from the game for violating the new policies that had gone into effect after they began playing.

MicroMUSE was using a highly customized version of TinyMUSE version 1.7b4. Many of these problems were fixed in version 1.8a4, and in later versions, but MicroMUSE suffered difficultly back-porting these changes into their version of the game.

With the eventual creation of new worlds using TinyMUSE, the attacks on MicroMUSE gradually ceased.

===Alternative MUSE installations===
Alternative TinyMUSE installations began to appear, based on the released version 1.8a4, which led to an argument over who "owned" TinyMUSE. At least one MicroMUSE administrator had fought against allowing other sites to use TinyMUSE as their codebase, and a small power-struggle took place between that administrator (Moulton) and the second primary developer (shkoo), who had taken over from the original primary developer (Jin).  The dispute was finally settled, and the newer TinyMUSE version 1.8a4 was released to the public.

By the end of 1993, computer power was becoming much cheaper.  One of the first alternatives, for instance, was run on an AMD 486/dx4-120, "over-clocked" to 160Mhz, with four megabytes of RAM.

Responsibility for the official development of TinyMUSE was never handed back to MicroMUSE.

==Today==
Today's version of MicroMUSE Cyberion's residents are scholars who lived in a unique community dedicated to learning, teaching, and the preservation of knowledge.  Dr. Barry Kort was instrumental in setting up MicroMUSE in its modern form, with assistance from Kevin Kane ("Frnkzk").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Nevada Millennium Scholarship''', also known as the Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship, offers [[Nevada]] high school graduates free or reduced tuition to in-state universities and colleges like the [[University of Nevada, Reno]] and [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]].

In 1999, Governor [[Kenny Guinn]]’s Millennium Scholarship initiative was enacted into law by the Nevada Legislature; the legislation (NRS 396.911) created the Millennium Scholarship trust fund to be administered by the State Treasurer. In October 1999, the Board of Regents adopted policy guidelines for the administration of the scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Governor Guinn Millennium Scholarship Program|url=https://nevadatreasurer.gov/millenniumscholarship.htm|accessdate=17 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508200309/https://nevadatreasurer.gov/MillenniumScholarship.htm|archivedate=8 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although there are a number of pathways to the Millennium Scholarship, by far the most common will be the successful completion of a rigorous program of study at a Nevada high school.
# You must graduate with a diploma from a Nevada class of the year 2000 or later;
# You must complete high school with at least an unweighted 3.25 grade point average calculated using all high average may be weighted or unweighted. You must pass all areas of the Nevada High School Proficiency Examination; and
# You must have been a resident of Nevada, for at least two of your high school years.

The scholarship was created using the money that Nevada received from the [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nevada Revised Statutes 396.911 - Legislative declaration|url=http://www.lawserver.com/law/state/nevada/nrs/nevada_revised_statutes_396-911|publisher=lawserver.com|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}} Currently, the scholarship allows up to $80 per credit hour for eligible students with a total lifetime value of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millennium Scholarship|url=http://www.unlv.edu/finaid/millennium-scholarship|publisher=unlv.edu|accessdate=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3751">The '''O'Reilly Foundation''' is a personal charitable trust set up in 1998 by media magnate, and former CEO of [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]], Sir [[Tony O'Reilly|Anthony "Tony" O'Reilly]]. Its function is the funding of educational projects;   the two main work areas  are capital developments at Irish colleges and an annual post-graduate scholarship programme for young people normally resident in [[Ireland]], with the aim of "supporting charitable endeavours for the betterment of [[Ireland]] and to promote excellence, global vision, community responsibility and leadership."&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oreillyfoundation.ie|title=The O'Reilly Foundation - Home|website=www.oreillyfoundation.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance and staffing==
General authority is vested in a Board of Trustees including, from the beginning, O'Reilly's current wife  [[Chryss Goulandris]], Lady O'Reilly as chairperson, plus his six children from his first marriage: Susan Wildman, [[Cameron O'Reilly]], Justine O'Reilly, [[Gavin O'Reilly]],  Caroline Dempsey, and  [[Tony O'Reilly, Junior]]

The oversight of the postgraduate scholarship scheme, is vested in the Scholarship Board, first chaired by the economist [[T. K. Whitaker]], and subsequently by former Registrar of [[University College Dublin]], Professor Emeritus [[John Kelly (engineer)|John Kelly]].

The Foundation has just one staff member, an executive secretary.

==Capital projects==
The Foundation has made a major contribution in May 2000 to complete funding of the 50% privately funded €22.2 million new library building for [[Dublin City University]], later named "The John and Aileen O'Reilly Library" in honour of Dr. O'Reilly's parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcu.ie/trust/library.shtml|title=Dublin, Ireland: DCU Educational Trust|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship Programme==
===Sponsorship===
The programme, which began in 1999, provides awards of around 25,400 euro annually.  In most years, two Scholars are nominated, for two years each, but in some years, there are three Scholars, and in some years, there will be a Scholar with a one-year award. The Foundation sponsors scholars who have an excellent academic record (First Class Honours - in the Irish / British systems - preferred) and who "have demonstrated leadership qualities", as well as the "potential and desire to make a significant contribution to the future of [[Ireland]]" .

The scholarships are stated to be chiefly aimed at Ph.D. candidates but have in fact been awarded for a wide range of types of student.  Certain disciplines are noted as preferences, namely Business Studies and Marketing, Science and Technology, Arts, Media Studies and Law.&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

===Notable alumni===
Over the first eleven years, or as the official website calls them, "cycles" of the programme, there were 26 awards made. Among them are included:
* Dr. [[Anita Sands]], 2nd cycle, commencing 2000, Masters in Public Policy and Management, [[Carnegie Mellon University]]
* [[Ruth Gilligan]], 11th cycle, commencing 2009, BA in English Literature at Cambridge University, to be followed by a Masters in Creative Writing at a US university

====Suspension of new awards, 2009====
After 11 cycles, the Trustees decided to invite no applications and make no award in 2009{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}, pending a review of the work of the Programme to date by the Board of Trustees, with inputs from the Scholarship Board.

The '''Physics Instructional Association''' ('''PIRA'''&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/&lt;/ref&gt;) is an association of [[physics education]] professionals and enthusiasts.  Members are physics teachers, physics administrators, physics educational support staff and physics students.  Interests cover all aspects of physics education with an emphasis on [[Demonstration (teaching)|demonstrations]], [[laboratory|laboratories]] and outreach.

The association is also responsible for maintaining the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS), a standardized scheme for categorization of physics demonstrations.

==Affiliations==
PIRA holds annual meetings during the summer meeting of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].  It is sponsored by the Apparatus Committee and annually hosts the Lecture Demonstration Workshop.  PIRA assists or hosts the Physics Demonstrations Show at each summer meeting when the hosting institution requests.

==Demonstration bibliography==
PIRA has continually updated the Demonstration Bibliography since its inception in the 1980s.  It is based on a unique numbering system called the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS).&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning.colorado.edu/PiraHome/dcs/PIRADCS.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme originated from the demonstrations catalog used at the University of Minnesota.

PIRA has also generated a subset of this list called the PIRA 200.&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/resources/pira-200&lt;/ref&gt;  These 200 demonstrations are the recommended basic collection for any physics department.

"'''Prick Up Your Ears'''" is the sixth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November 19, 2006. In this episode, Lois discovers that Chris' school has removed the [[sex education]] program due to budget cuts and decides to bring the class back by becoming the teacher. Unfortunately, she gets fired a short time later for teaching the students about safe sex rather than abstinence. Meanwhile, Stewie attempts to find and kill the [[Tooth Fairy]] after being told "horror" stories by Brian.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007thh4|title=Prick Up Your Ears: Brief plot synopsis|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2006|publisher=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was written by [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and directed by [[James Purdum]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Taylor Cole]], [[Lauren Conrad]], [[David Cross]], [[Margaret Easley]], Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[André Sogliuzzo]] and [[Crawford Wilson]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.

==Plot==
As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] finds [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and his friends watching a [[pornographic film]], she becomes convinced a proper [[sex education|sex-ed]] class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about [[safe sex]], but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform [[premarital sex]], rather than [[abstinence]]. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She is replaced by a reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] loses a tooth and is told about the [[tooth fairy]]. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has [[bulimia nervosa]], in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], stealing teeth to roll around in them.

Peter, truly believing the anti-sex propaganda Meg brings home, starts wearing a [[chastity belt]] and refuses to have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in "ear sex" (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex "in the eyes of the Lord." This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only as long as it is practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] poking out the window and saying the line "Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!".

==Production and censorship==
Many scenes from the original episode were seen as vulgar and were removed from the television broadcast.  One of the scenes removed was from the beginning of the episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching ''Genital Hospital'', a reference to the television show ''[[General Hospital]]''. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"&gt;{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on [[Adult Swim]] every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex).&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In this scene, Peter refers to [[the Grimace]] as [[Ronald McDonald]]'s [[Autism|autistic]] friend, which was originally penned as "retarded friend" (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird-tasting [[Smuckers]] jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In a scene added later to the episode, [[Mel Gibson]] apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]'s house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV.&lt;ref name="SMith"&gt;{{cite video | people=Smith, Danny|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite video | people=Goodman, David|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ending of this episode (with the "choose your own ending" text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.

In addition to the regular cast, actors [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Taylor Cole]], [[Lauren Conrad]], [[David Cross]], [[Margaret Easley]], Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[André Sogliuzzo]] and [[Crawford Wilson]] guest star in the episode. Recurring guest voices include [[Lori Alan]], [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Steve Callaghan]], Chris Cox, [[Ralph Garman]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[Alec Sulkin]], [[John Viener]], and [[Adam West]], who has a role of an exaggerated version of himself.

==Cultural references==
As Lois is informed the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims "Oh, no!", a cut-a-way scene then begins of a [[sports car]] driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] (from ''[[Transformers (fiction)|The Transformers]]'') and [[Man-E-Faces]], all of which are fictional characters for television programs.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; When Peter is watching television, he is watching ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]''; the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show.&lt;ref name="Makkos"&gt;{{cite video | people=Makkos, Suzanna|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused.  The scene cuts to [[Michael Jackson]] in his childhood form eating a bowl of [[Frosted Mini-Wheats]], saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[William Shakespeare]] and a [[Rainbow Brite]] doll to demonstrate [[sexual intercourse]]. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie ''[[Airplane!]]''. While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], he mentions the death of singer [[Karen Carpenter]], who died from anorexia in 1983.

==Reception==
In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode also acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18–49 demographic, tying with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while still winning over ''[[American Dad!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=111406_09 |title=Weekly Program Rankings |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221062706/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=111406_09 |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the episode received little positive reception, it was given a positive review by ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Dan Iverson, who noted that its plot had "great satire of the issue of sex education vs. abstinence".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/746/746822p1.html|title=Family Guy: "Prick Up Your Ears" Review|work=[[IGN]]|author=Iverson, Dan|accessdate=2007-12-14|date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "the random flashback jokes are often what are most memorable about each episode".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; He gave the episode a rating of 7.8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; In his review of ''Family Guy'', volume 5, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode "a smart jab at the conservative Christian approach to sex education", and stated that "the effect it has on Meg, as well as Peter, is great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/30387/family-guy-volume-5/|title=Family Guy, Volume 5|work=DVD Talk|author=Rizzo, Francis III|date=September 18, 2007|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regional Maritime University''' (RMU), is an international [[tertiary institution]] and [[private university]] in [[Accra]], [[Ghana]]. RMU attained full University status on 25 October 2007 and was launched as such by [[John Agyekum Kufuor]], former [[President of Ghana|President of the Republic of Ghana]]. It was first called Regional Maritime Academy.

==History==
On 1 October 1982, the Government of Ghana promulgated the Regional Maritime Law 1982, which was followed by the signing of the instrument of transfer, handing over the college to the then Ministerial Conference of West and Central African States on Maritime Transport (MINCONMAR), now known as Maritime Organization of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), which negotiated for its regionalization.&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt;

The college was then renamed The Regional Maritime Academy (RMA). The formal inauguration of the RMA took place 26 May 1983 with [[Ghana]] as a  founding member.&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt;

[[Regionalization]] of the [[academy]] was for cooperation, particularly with regard to the training of personnel to ensure the sustained growth and development of maritime industries in the sub-region and beyond. The academy in Ghana serves the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] countries while a sister academy in Ivory Coast (&lt;!-- [[L'Académie Régionale des Sciences et Techniques de la Mer]] --&gt;L'Académie Régionale des Sciences et Techniques de la Mer – ARSTM) serves the [[Francophone]] countries.

==Organization==

===Regional Maritime University===
The Regional Maritime University (RMU), Accra, Ghana, is an international [[tertiary institution]] and [[private university]].&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt;

The RMU occupies the premises of the old Ghana Nautical College which was established in 1958 to train ratings for the erstwhile State Shipping Corporation (Black Star Line).&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt; On 1 October 1982, the Government of Ghana promulgated the Regional Maritime Law 1982 which was followed by the signing of the instrument of transfer, handing over the College to the then Ministerial Conference of West and Central African States on Maritime Transport (MINCONMAR), now known as Maritime Organization of West and Central Africa (MOWCA), which negotiated for its regionalization.&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt; The College was then renamed The Regional Maritime Academy (R.M.A.).&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt;

The overall objective for the establishment of RMU was to promote regional co-operation in the maritime industry focusing on the training to ensure the sustained growth and development of the industry.&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt; The RMU is a branch of the [[World Maritime University]], [[Malmö]], [[Sweden]] and an affiliate of the [[University of Ghana]],&lt;ref name="UG Profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ug.edu.gh/profile.php |title=About Us:Profile of the University |accessdate =10 March 2007  |publisher=University of Ghana |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070210231334/http://www.ug.edu.gh/profile.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Legon]]. 

The University has working relations with other universities in the sub-region. The RMA has since December, 2004 been given Institutional Accreditation by the [[National Accreditation Board (Ghana)|National Accreditation Board, Ghana]].&lt;ref name="UG Profile"/&gt;

'''Serge Lifar''' ({{lang-ua|Сергій Михайлович Лифар}}, ''Serhіy Mуkhailovуch Lуfar''; {{lang-ru|link=no|Серге́й Миха́йлович Лифа́рь}}, ''Sergey Mikhaylovich Lifar'') ({{OldStyleDate|15&amp;nbsp;April|1905|2 April}}, [[Kiev]], [[Russian Empire]]{{spaced ndash}}15 December 1986, [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]) was a French ballet dancer and choreographer of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian origin]], famous as one of the greatest male ballet dancers of the 20th century.  Not only a dancer, Lifar was also a choreographer, director, writer, theoretician about dance, and collector.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crisp|first=Clement|title=ICARE: Remembering Serge Lifar|journal=Dance Research: The Journal of the Society for Dance Research|date=Winter 2002|volume=20|series=2|pages=3–15|doi=10.3366/1290812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[ballet master]] of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1930 to 1944, and from 1947 to 1958, he devoted himself to the restoration of the technical level of the [[Paris Opera Ballet]], returning it to its place as one of the best companies in the world.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===
Lifar was born in [[Kiev]], [[Russian Empire]]. His year of birth is officially shown as 1904 (as on a 2004 Ukrainian stamp commemorating his centenary). 
He was the pupil of [[Bronislava Nijinska]] in her ballet studio «School of Movement» in [[Kiev]].

In 1921 he left the [[Soviet Union]] and was noticed by [[Serge Diaghilev]], who sent him to [[Turin]] in order to improve his technique with [[Enrico Cecchetti]].

=== Ballets Russes ===
He made his debut at the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1923, where he became the principal dancer in 1925.&lt;ref name=Dict.&gt;''A Dictionary of Twentieth Century World Biography.'' United Kingdom: [[Book Club Associates]], 1992, p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; Lifar was considered the successor to [[Nijinsky]] in the [[Ballets Russes]].&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt; He was cast at the age of 21 opposite [[Tamara Karsavina]] in Nijinska's ''Roméo et Juliette'' (1926) ; Karsavina was twice his age.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt; He originated leading roles in three [[Balanchine]] ballets for the Ballet Russes, including ''La Chatte'' (1927), with a score by French composer [[Henri Sauguet]] and based on an [[Aesop]] fable, which featured Lifar's famous entrance in a 'chariot' formed by his male companions;  ''Apollon Musagète'' (1928) with a score by [[Stravinsky]] depicting the birth of the Greek God [[Apollo]] and his encounter with the three muses, [[Calliope]], [[Polyhymnia]], and [[Terpsichore]]; and ''Le Fils prodigue'' (''The Prodigal Son'') (1929), with a score by [[Prokofiev]], the last great ballet of the Diaghilev era.&lt;ref name="Au 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Au|first=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|year=2002|publisher=Thames and Hudson|isbn=0-500-20352-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Paris Opéra Ballet ===
At the death of [[Diaghilev]] in 1929, Lifar at the age of 24 was invited by [[Jacques Rouché]] to take over the directorship of the [[Paris Opéra Ballet]], which had fallen into decline in the late 19th century. Lifar gave the company a new strength and purpose, initiating the rebirth of ballet in France, and began to create the first of many ballets for that company.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt; These were immediately successful, such as ''Les Créatures de Prométhée'' (1929), a personal version of ''Le Spectre de la rose'' (1931); and ''L'Après-midi d'un faune'' (1935); ''Icare'' (1935), with costumes and decor by [[Picasso]]; ''Istar'' (1941); and ''Suite en Blanc'' (1943), which he qualified as ''[[Neoclassical ballet]]''.

As part of his effort to revitalize dance, Lifar thought the basic principles of ballet—specifically the [[Positions of the feet in ballet|five positions of the feet]]—denied mobility for the dancer. He codified two additional positions, known as the sixth and seventh positions, with the feet turned in, not out like the first five positions.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The sixth and seventh positions were not Lifar's inventions, but revivals of positions that already existed in the eighteenth century, when there were ten positions of the feet in classical ballet;&lt;ref name="Paolacci"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and their use is limited to Lifar's choreographies.

During his three decades as director of the Paris Opéra Ballet, Lifar led the company through the turbulent times of [[World War II]] and the German occupation of France. Lifar was a collaborationist under the occupation {Franko, “Serge Lifar and the Question of Collaboration with the German Authorities under the Occupation of Paris (1940-1949),” in Dance Research 35/2 (Winter 2017): 218-257}. Lifar's postwar trial resulted in his condemnation as a collaborator and his suspension from the national stage. During his absence, Balanchine was hired to replace him.
 
Returning to his former position, Lifar's presence was vehemently opposed by the Opera stagehands with the result that he was not allowed to appear on stage nor to consult with technical staff directly on any productions. Nevertheless, he brought the Paris Opéra Ballet to America and performed to full houses at the [[New York City Center]] despite protests. Audiences were enthusiastic and had great admiration for the company of dancers.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt; He undoubtedly influenced [[Yvette Chauviré]], [[Janine Charrat]], and [[Roland Petit]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1958, Lifar was forced into retirement due to a strained relationship with the Opera management. A famous photograph was taken of Lifar leaving the [[Palais Garnier]], after being forced to resign, looking somber and clasping the wings from the costume of [[Icarus]] that the character puts on in order to fly.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt;

=== Later life ===
On 30 March 1958, at age 52, Lifar faced off against the 72-year-old [[impresario]] [[George de Cuevas]] in a duel in France. The duel was precipitated by an argument over changes to ''Black and White'' (''Suite en blanc''), a ballet by Lifar that was being presented by the Cuevas ballet company. Lifar had his face slapped in public after insisting that he retained the rights to ''Black and White''. Lifar sent his seconds to Cuevas who refused to extend an apology and chose to duel with swords. As duels had been "technically outlawed" in the 17th Century, the time and location of the duel were not disclosed to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Staff.

Accessed November 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The duel was conducted in front of 50 newspaper photographers and ended with the two combatants in tears and embraces in what ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "what may well have been the most delicate encounter in the history of French dueling," with the sole injury being a cut on Lifar's right forearm in the seventh minute.&lt;ref&gt;Blair. W. Granger.

Accessed November 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the Paris Opéra Ballet devoted a full evening to his choreography.

=== Death ===

==Legacy==
[[File:Serge Lyfar Stamp.jpg|thumb|2004 Ukrainian Stamp]]
Editions Sauret published his memoirs, titled ''Les Mémoires d'Icare'', posthumously in 1993. The title references one of his greatest roles in the ballet ''Icare''. "The story of the ballet is based on the ancient Greek myth of [[Icarus]], whose father [[Daedalus]] builds him a pair of artificial wings.  Disobeying his father's orders, Icarus flies too close to the sun, which melts the wax in his wings and causes him to plunge to his death."&lt;ref name="Au 2002"/&gt;

The Serge Lifar Foundation was set up on 23 August 1989 by Lifar's companion, Countess Lillian Ahlefeldt-Laurvig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Foundation|url=http://www.sergelifar.org/?page_id=115&amp;lang=en|publisher=Fondation Serge Lifar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, jewels from the Countess' estate were auctioned at [[Sotheby's]], with the proceeds going to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magnificent Jewels and Noble Jewels|url=http://www.sothebys.com/fr/catalogues/ecatalogue.html/2012/magnificent-jewels-and-noble-jewels#/r=/fr/ecat.fhtml.GE1202.html+r.m=/fr/ecat.lot.GE1202.html/720/|publisher=Sothebys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1994 on the stage of the [[Kiev Opera|National Ukraine Opera]] the First International Ballet Contest was held named after Serge Lifar. The Sixth Lifar International Ballet Competition was held in April 2006 and the seventh in [[Donetsk]] in March–April 2011.

==Awards and honours==
* Commandeur des [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Arts et des Lettres]]
* Chevalier de la [[Legion of Honour|Légion d'honneur]] (1983)

== Books ==
In 1935 Lifar published his ''confessio fidei'' ("confession of faith") titled ''Le manifesto du chorégraphe'', proposing laws about the independence of choreography.  Some of views include:
{{cquote|We cannot, should not, dance everything. Ballet must remain closely linked to dance itself: ballet cannot be the illustration of any other art.  Ballet should not borrow its rhythmic shape from music.  Ballet can freely exist without musical accompaniment.  When a ballet is closely linked to its score, the rhythmic base must be dictated by the choreographer and not the composer. The choreographer must not be the slave of the painter/designer.  A free and independent choreographic theatre must be created.&lt;ref name="Crisp 2002 3–15"/&gt;}}

He also wrote a biography of Diaghilev titled ''Serge Diaghilev, His Life, His Work, His Legend: An Intimate Biography'' published by Putnam, London, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=E.B.|author2=Cyril W.

The '''Sustainable Development Goals''' (SDGs), also known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, is a set of seventeen global goals for 169 specific areas developed by the United Nations during a deliberative process involving its 193 member states on 25 September 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As one of the participants, Iran pledged to carry out the 2030 Agenda. In December 2016 the Government of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] held a special ceremony announcing a national education initiative that was arranged by the [[UNESCO]] office in Iran to implement the educational objectives of this global program. The announcement created a stir among politicians and [[Marja']] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=What is the 2030 Agenda?|url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/02/17/1400270/%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-%D8%A2%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B4-2030-%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%DA%A9%D9%88-%DA%86%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D8%AF%D9%84%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%84%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%DA%A9%D9%88-%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%B4%D8%A8%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%A8%D9%88%D8%AF|website=Tasnimnews|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainable Development Goals==

{{Main article|Sustainable Development Goals}}
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, contains a set of seventeen Global Goals for 169 specific areas. This document was prepared by 193 United Nations (UN) Member States, as well as global civil society. The resolution is a broader agreement than the intergovernmental [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] (successor to the Millennium Development Goals).{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=If possible, give years for these.}} Iran attended that conference{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=What conference?

==History==
According to [[Al-Monitor]], all 192 UN member states must "ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning" for everyone, regardless of gender, ethnicity, or age, by the year 2030. Based on this document, the Rouhani administration designed its own educational plan called "The Islamic Republic of Iran 2030 National Education Act: Moving Toward Quality Education and Lifelong Learning, "but it hadn't been approved by the [[Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution]] (SCRC).{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=According to whom?}}&lt;ref name="al-monitor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alipour|first1=Zahra|title=Teaching of gender equality sparks infighting in Iran|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/06/iran-unesco-2030-education-plan-rouhani-criticism.html|website=al-monitor|accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2030 Agenda is not the first educational initiative in Iran. [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] proposed "The Fundamental Reform Document of Education (FRDE) in the Islamic Republic of Iran" in 2011. Based on Islamic teachings, that initiative sought to "foster monotheist individuals who have faith in God and believe in the Hereafter".&lt;ref name="al-monitor"/&gt;

==Criticism==

=== Ali Khamenei ===

On 7 May 2017 the Iranian [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]], [[Ali Khamenei|Ayatollah Ali Khamenei]], criticized the 2030 National Education Act, saying:{{quote|It is the Islamic Republic here! Here, Islam is the benchmark! The Quran is the benchmark! It is not a place where the deficient, destructive, and corrupt Western lifestyle can infiltrate! ... The UNESCO 2030 education agenda and the like are not agendas that the Islamic Republic of Iran should have to surrender and submit to.}} He also questioned why so-called international organization{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=Is this one organization or more than one? It's got to be either "why a so-called international organization" or "why so-called international organizations".}} under the influence of big powers were making educational decisions for countries with differing histories and cultures.&lt;ref name="Trend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Karimov|first1=Fatih|title=Khamenei slams UNESCO, says to not accept its education agenda|url=https://en.trend.az/iran/politics/2751121.html|website=Trend|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tasnimnews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=No Place for 2030 Education Agenda in Iran: Leader|url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2017/05/07/1400506/no-place-for-2030-education-agenda-in-iran-leader|website=Tasnimnews|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi ===

According to Iranian politician [[Mohammad Mehdi Zahedi]], the subject of [[Human rights]] in the 2030 Agenda is based on American concepts, which, he said, were far from the ideal of human generosity. He declared that Islam does emphasize gender justice and that there was no way to measure [[gender equality]]. He added that Iranians believe that any educational initiative must be based on Islamic tradition, because the Quran clearly speaks about education, but the 2030 Agenda strongly recommended that learning religious tradition and beliefs should not be emphasized in public education.{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=So..... The point of this overly long sentence is not clear. Is Zahedi objecting to the entirety of the 2030 Agenda, or only part of it? Whichever it is, his objection needs to be spelled out more specifically.}}&lt;ref name="YJC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=The 2030 Agenda was accepted secretly|url=http://www.yjc.ir/fa/news/6077831/%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-2030-%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%D8%B3%DA%A9%D9%88-%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B1-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87-%D9%BE%D8%B0%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%B4-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%DA%AF%D9%88%D8%B4-%D8%B4%D9%86%D9%88%D8%A7%DB%8C%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%AD-%D8%B4%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-%D9%88%D8%AC%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%86%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF|website=YJC|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi ===

On 22 May 2017 [[Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi]] brought up the 2030 UNESCO document during a lecture for seminary students in the holy city of Qom. Describing many of the document's goals as "beautiful and humane", Makarem Shirazi said{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=Is something missing here? What did Makarem Shirazi say? If the only thing he said is what is in the first part of this sentence, then remove "Makarem Shirazi said".}}, meaning that it would "consolidate the hegemonic system". He also reiterated Rouhani's comments about adopting the document as long as it did not interfere with Iran's religion and culture and said, "They [the Rouhani administration] have put this in writing and sent a letter, signed by three ministers, to the supreme leader and sent a copy of it to us as well. However, they seem to have forgotten that the creators of this document will only agree to those exceptions and conditions written below it that do not oppose the spirit of the document."&lt;ref name="al-monitor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trend"/&gt; He also stated that the 2030 Agenda was full of words that must be interpreted in their way; for example, the word "family" was used in the Agenda refers to all kinds of families, including same-sex couples. In addition, due to the meaning represented for [[violence]], [[Basij]] (The Organization for Mobilization of the Oppressed, one of the five forces of the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]]) and the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|IRGC]] have to be considered examples of violence.&lt;ref name="ISNA"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=The 2030 Agenda in view of Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi|url=http://www.isna.ir/news/96030100596/%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%AF%DA%AF%D8%A7%D9%87-%D8%A2%DB%8C%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87-%D9%85%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%B4%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B2%DB%8C-%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87-%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%AF-2030|website=ISNA|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hassan Rahimpour Azghadi ===

According to [[Hassan Rahimpour Azghadi]], a member of the [[Supreme Council of the Cultural Revolution]], last year UNESCO said it was committed to the goal that the 2030 Agenda be implemented in all countries, although participation was apparently voluntary, and that it was up to each government to carry out this educational Agenda by the year 2030. The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)]] stated that implementation of the 2030 Agenda was not obligatory, but that if the Agenda was not carried out, the government would be found negligent. Some people{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--Note: Read all my notes before starting to re-word these sentences. 1) Who are these people? "Some people" is too vague. 2) Who made this statement? Who said this?--&gt; believe the 2030 Agenda is an example of [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|cultural JCPOA]], which produces nothing except treading on the rights of the people. According to the contents of the 2030 Agenda, it finds{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--Normally, it is people who find things, or notice things, so this is not the right phrase. You should have a sentence that answers this question: Who sees, noticed, or pointed out the similarities?--&gt; similarities between Islamic views and Liberal or Neo-liberal views about children's rights and the education of women and family, but there are essential paradoxes. We do not say all the contents of the 2030 Agenda are contrary to Islam, definitely there are matters that correspond to Islamic tradition, so we don't disagree with all of this Agenda, but the problem is, why was this document (which goes against Islam in some articles) signed by neglecting the "upper document"?{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--You can't just ask a question like this. You have to say who asked this question, or who questions something about the document.--&gt; Due to the 2030 Agenda [[Sex education ]] for children is their right, but teaching sexual abstinence and [[modesty]] is treading on their rights.{{clarify|date=September 2017}} &lt;!--Whose rights? Even if you said it earlier in the paragraph, you should say it again here for clarity--UNLESS this entire paragraph is a quote, in which case you can ignore my questions, above, and put it into blockquote format.--&gt; Based on the 2030 Agenda we have to answer to western educators about how the Agenda is being implemented in our schools. In signing the document, we had agreed that sex education for children guarantees the health of the family and that homosexuality is one of the basic rights of humans. The parameters of training a child are based on [[secularism]]. According to the 2030 Agenda foreign advisers must control{{clarify|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--If this entire paragraph is not a direct quote (see note above), and these sentences are merely a paraphrase of Azghadi's words, then I would change "must control" to "must retain control" or "must continue to exercise control over".--&gt; [[education in Iran]].&lt;ref name="FarsNews"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=The 2030 Agenda is a educational capitulation|url=http://www.farsnews.com/13951223001322|website=FarsNews|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hajar Tahriri Niksefat ===

Hajar Tahriri Niksefat, the head of the women's committee in the election headquarters of the town of [[Raisi]] in the northern province of Gilan, said she believed that educating children regarding gender equality was "not necessarily to the child's benefit, but could also be oppressive."  She added, "In our country, family, marriage, controlling sexual desire, and satisfying it through proper channels are emphasized and taught at their appropriate time. We will not consider relations that in our national and religious teachings are viewed as improper, and we do not think it is fit to teach them in our schools."&lt;ref name="al-monitor"/&gt;

'''Tax resistance''' is the refusal to pay [[tax]] because of opposition to the government that is imposing the tax, or to government policy, or as [[Taxation as theft|opposition to taxation in itself]]. Tax resistance is a form of [[direct action]] and, if in violation of the tax regulations, also a form of [[civil disobedience]].

Examples of tax resistance campaigns include those advocating [[home rule]], such as the [[Salt March]] led by [[Mahatma Gandhi]], and those promoting [[women's suffrage]], such as the [[Women's Tax Resistance League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gandhi and King: The power of nonviolent resistance |author=Michael J. Nojeim |year=2004 |page=142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lme8yEeWOr8C&amp;pg=PA142 }}&lt;/ref&gt; War tax resistance is the refusal to pay some or all taxes that pay for [[war]], and may be practiced by [[conscientious objector]]s, [[pacifism|pacifists]], or those protesting against a particular war.&lt;ref name=NWTRCC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/what_is_wtr.php|title=What is War Tax Resistance?|publisher=NWTRCC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax resisters are distinct from "[[Tax protester (United States)|tax protesters]]," who deny that the legal obligation to pay taxes exists or applies to them. Tax resisters may accept that some law commands them to pay taxes but they still choose to resist taxation.

==History==
{{main|History of tax resistance}}
[[File:Wells egyptian peasants taxes.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Egyptian peasants seized for non-payment of taxes during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Pyramid Age]].]]
[[File:Boston Tea Party Currier colored.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boston Tea Party]], 16 December 1773.]]
The earliest and most widespread forms of taxation were the [[corvée]] and [[tithe]], both of which can be traced back to the beginning of [[civilization]]. The corvée was state-imposed [[Unfree labour|forced labour]] on [[peasant]]s too poor to pay other forms of taxation (''labour'' in [[Ancient Egyptian literature|ancient Egyptian]] is a synonym for taxes).&lt;ref name=burg&gt;{{cite book|title=A World History of Tax Rebellions|author=David F. Burg|year=2004|pages=vi-viii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T91k6HAODzAC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low taxes helped the Roman aristocracy increase their wealth, which equalled or exceeded the revenues of the central government. An emperor sometimes replenished his treasury by confiscating the estates of the "super-rich", but in the later period, the resistance of the wealthy to paying taxes was one of the factors contributing to the collapse of the Empire.&lt;ref name="Hopkins p. 184"&gt;[[#Morris|Morris]], p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because some believe taxation is oppressive, governments have always struggled with [[tax noncompliance]] and resistance.&lt;ref name=burg /&gt; Indeed, it has been suggested that tax resistance played a significant role in the collapse of several [[empire]]s, including the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]], and [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economic Psychology of Tax Behaviour|author=Erich Kirchler|authorlink=Erich Kirchler|page=182|year=2007|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511628238|quote=Governments as far back as ancient Egypt have struggled to maintain compliance with tax laws. Indeed, it has been suggested that tax resistance has played a significant role in the collapse of several major world orders, including the Egyptian, Roman, Spanish and Aztec empires (Erard, 1997).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of collective tax refusal include [[Zealotry|Zealot]]s resisting the Roman [[Tax per head|poll tax]] during the 1st century AD, culminating in the [[First Jewish–Roman War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=We Won't Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historic events that originated as tax revolts include the [[Magna Carta]], the [[American Revolution]] and the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=burg /&gt;

War tax resisters often highlight the relationship between [[income tax]] and war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of war tax resistance|url=http://www.peacetaxseven.com/history.html|publisher=The Peace Tax Seven}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] income tax was introduced in 1799, to pay for weapons and equipment in preparation for the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic wars]], whilst the [[Union (American Civil War)|US federal government]] imposed their first income tax in the [[Revenue Act of 1861]] to help pay for the [[American Civil War]].

==Views and aims==
[[File:Benjamin D. Maxham - Henry David Thoreau - Restored - greyscale - straightened.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Henry David Thoreau]], author of ''[[Civil Disobedience (Thoreau)|Civil Disobedience]]''.]]
[[:Category:Tax resisters|Tax resisters]] come from a wide range of backgrounds with diverse [[ideology|ideologies]] and aims. For example, [[Henry David Thoreau]] and [[William Lloyd Garrison]] drew inspiration from the American Revolution and the stubborn pacifism of the [[Quakers]].&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite book|title=We Won't Pay: A Tax Resistance Reader|editor=David M. Gross|year=2008|page=Back cover}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tax resisters refuse to pay tax because their conscience will not allow them to fund war, whilst others resist tax as part of a campaign to overthrow the government.&lt;ref name=gross /&gt;

Tax resisters have been violent revolutionaries like [[John Adams]] and pacifist [[nonresistance|nonresistants]] like [[John Woolman]]; communists like [[Karl Marx]] and capitalists like [[Vivien Kellems]]; solitary [[anti-war movement|anti-war]] activists like [[Ammon Hennacy]] and leaders of independence movements like Mahatma Gandhi.&lt;ref name=gross /&gt;

[[Leo Tolstoy]], a [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]], urged government leaders to change their attitude to war and citizens to taxes:

{{quote|If only each King, Emperor, and President understood that his work of directing armies is not an honourable and important duty, as his flatterers persuade him it is, but a bad and shameful act of preparation for murder — and if each private individual understood that the payment of taxes wherewith to hire and equip soldiers, and, above all, army-service itself, are not matters of indifference, but are bad and shameful actions by which he not only permits but participates in murder — then this power of Emperors, Kings, and Presidents, which now arouses our indignation, and which causes them to be murdered, would disappear of itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leo Tolstoy|title=[[s:Thou Shalt Not Kill|Thou Shalt Not Kill]]|year=1900}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Methods==
As an example of the numerous tax resistance methods, below are some of the legal and illegal techniques used by war tax resisters:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/how_to_resist.php|title=How to Refuse to Pay for War}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal===

====Avoidance====
A resister may lower their tax payments by using legal [[tax avoidance]] techniques.

====Paying under protest====
Some taxpayers pay their taxes, but include protest letters along with their tax forms.  Others pay in a protesting form — for instance, by writing their cheque on a [[toilet seat]] or a mock-up of a missile.  Others pay in a way that creates inconvenience for the collector — for instance, by paying the entire amount in low-denomination coins. This last method is less effective in countries where small coins are [[legal tender]] only in limited amounts, allowing the tax authority legally to reject such payments; for example in England and Wales, 1p coins are legal tender only in amounts up to 20p.

====Reducing taxable income and consumption====
[[File:PeacePark.jpg|thumb|right|The [[White House Peace Vigil]], started by [[Thomas (activist)|Thomas]] in 1981 and supported by tax resister [[Ellen Thomas]].]]
Other tax resisters change their lifestyles so that they owe less tax. For instance; to avoid [[consumption tax]]es on alcohol, a resister might [[Homebrewing|home-brew beer]]; to avoid [[excise|excise taxes]] on gasoline, a resister might take up [[Vehicular cycling|cycling]]; to avoid income tax, a resister may reduce their income below the [[income tax threshold|tax threshold]] by embracing simple living or a [[freeganism|freegan]] lifestyle.&lt;ref name=nwtrcc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwtrcc.org/practical5.php|title=Low Income/Simple Living as War Tax Resistance|publisher=NWTRCC}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, UK citizens pay no income tax if their income is below the [[personal allowance]]. In the US the equivalent tax-free annual income is the sum of the [[standard deduction]] and [[Personal exemption (United States)|personal exemption]], though many deductions and credits allow people to earn much more than this and still avoid income tax.&lt;ref name=nwtrcc /&gt;

Opposition to war has led some, such as Ammon Hennacy and Ellen Thomas, to a form of tax resistance in which they reduce their income below the tax threshold by taking up a [[simple living]] lifestyle.&lt;ref name=nwtrcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Hagengruber |title=DC protest group stands test of time |date=July 9, 2000 |publisher=KnightRidder |url=http://www.prop1.org/history/2000/000709kr.DC%20protest%20group%20stands%20test%20of%20time.htm|quote=I decided that when I didn't need to worry about providing for my daughter, I was going to reduce my income to below the poverty level so I wouldn't have to pay taxes, because I don't agree with the policies [of the U.S. government]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals believe that their government is engaged in immoral, unethical or destructive activities such as war, and paying taxes inevitably funds these activities.&lt;ref name=nwtrcc /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=19Mar05&amp;showyear=2005 Picket Line Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

These methods differ from [[tax evasion]] in that they stay within the tax laws, and they differ from tax avoidance in that the goal is to pay as little tax as possible rather than to keep as much post-tax income as possible.

===Illegal===

====Evasion====
A resister may decide to reduce their tax paid through illegal tax evasion. For instance, one way to evade income tax is to only work for [[cash-in-hand]], therefore circumventing [[withholding tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=16Feb06 |title=The Picket Line — 16 February 2006 |publisher=Sniggle.net |date=2006-02-16 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redirection====
Some tax resisters refuse to pay all or a portion of the taxes due, but then make an equivalent donation to charity.  In this way, they demonstrate that the intent of their resistance is not selfish and that they want to use a portion of their earnings to contribute to the common good.

For instance, [[Julia Butterfly Hill]] resisted about $150,000 in federal taxes, and donated that money to after school programs, arts and cultural programs, community gardens, programs for Native Americans, alternatives to incarceration, and environmental protection programs.  She said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I actually take the money that the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] says goes to them and I give it to the places where our taxes ''should'' be going. And in my letter to the IRS I said: "I'm not refusing to pay my taxes. I'm actually paying them but I'm paying them where they belong because you refuse to do so."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Gar "An Interview with Julia Butterfly Hill: Part 1" ''The Edge'' 26 May 2005 [http://www.sniggle.net/Experiment/index.php?entry=10Sep05]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Groups like the [[National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund]] (United States), [[Peace Tax Seven]] (United Kingdom), {{Interlanguage link multi|Netzwerk Friedenssteuer|de}} (Germany), and [[Conscience and Peace Tax International]] are working to legalize a form of [[conscientious objection to military taxation]] which would enable conscientious objectors to designate their taxes to be spent only on non-military budget items.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm The Mission of the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165301/http://www.peacetaxfund.org/aboutus/mission.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}; [http://www.peacetaxseven.com/ Peace Tax Seven]; [http://www.netzwerk-friedenssteuer.de/ Netzwerk-Friedenssteuer]; [http://cpti.ws/ Conscience and Peace Tax International]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olshewsky, Steve "[http://fum.org/answering-the-divine-grace-of-time/ Answering the Divine Grace of Time] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130013303/http://fum.org/answering-the-divine-grace-of-time/ |date=2012-11-30 }}" ''Quaker Life'' Nov/Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  They see this as a legalized form of war tax redirection.

====Refusing specific taxes====
Some resisters refuse to willingly pay only certain taxes, either because those taxes are especially noxious to them, or because they present a useful symbolic target, or because they are more easily resisted.

For instance, in the [[United States]], many tax resisters resist the [[telephone federal excise tax]]. The tax was initiated to pay for the [[Spanish–American War]] and has frequently been raised or extended by the government during times of war. This made it an attractive symbolic target as a "[[war tax]]".  Such refusal is relatively safe: because this tax is typically small, resistance very rarely triggers significant government retaliation.  Phone companies will cooperate with such resisters by removing the excise tax from their phone bills and reporting their resistance to the government.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/04/BUGG2G1PMA1.DTL Not paying phone tax becomes war protest]" ''San Francisco Chronicle'' 4 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

====Refusing to pay====
The most dramatic and characteristic method of tax resistance is to refuse to pay a tax – either by quietly ignoring the tax bill or by openly declaring the refusal to pay.

Some tax resisters resist only a portion of the taxes due.  For instance, some war tax resisters refuse to pay a percentage of their taxes equivalent to the military percentage of the government's budget.

Other resisters withhold a symbolic amount – for instance, in the United States, some might hold back $17.76/17.76% (symbolic of the revolutionary year 1776) or $10.40/10.4% (in tribute to [[Form 1040]], which is used in federal income tax returns).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5013">'''Timothy''' "'''Speed'''" '''Levitch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|v|ɪ|tʃ}}; born July 9, 1970) is an American actor, tour guide, poet, speaker, philosopher, author and [[voice actor]].  The name "Speed" was given to him by a childhood friend in high school. Levitch has appeared in multiple films and has had his poetic and philosophical works published in books and periodicals.

==Biography==
Levitch was born July 9, 1970 in New York City. He mostly grew up in the [[Riverdale, Bronx|Riverdale]] neighborhood of [[the Bronx]], where he attended the [[Horace Mann School]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruni, Frank. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E6DC1738F932A35753C1A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 "Manhattan Through a Warped Window; Featured in a Film: A Homeless Tour Guide's Offbeat City View"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', October 1, 1998. Accessed May 4, 2008. "Mr. Levitch grew up in a middle-class Jewish family of five in Riverdale, the Bronx, and attended Horace Mann, a respected private school."&lt;/ref&gt; When he was twelve, his parents bought a house in [[Westchester County, New York]], and he was briefly a [[suburban]]ite. He longed to return to New York City and eventually he did.

In 1992 he received his tour guide license from the [[Central Park Conservancy]]. He later took a position with Apple and [[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line Tours]] as a [[tour bus]] guide.  He soon attracted a cult-like following, due not only to his fast talking style, but also for his obvious love of portraying his native city in psychedelic terms and passionate philosophical ideas. Levitch's cult was spread beyond NYC when he became the subject of the 1998 [[Documentary film|documentary]] ''[[The Cruise (documentary)|The Cruise]]''.  In 2000, Levitch was a citizen of the art project Quiet, We Live in Sane.

In August 2012, Levitch premiered a new documentary video series on its own Hulu channel. The series, directed by [[Richard Linklater]] and entitled ''[[Up to Speed (TV series)|Up To Speed]]'', takes viewers on virtual tours of American cities, conversing with inanimate objects like San Francisco's [[Mission District, San Francisco#Festivals.2C parades and fairs|gold fire hydrant]] and Chicago's original [[Haymarket affair#Haymarket memorials|Haymarket Riot memorial]].&lt;ref name="Interview092012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/09/interview-up-to-speed-speed-levitch | title=Interview: "Up To Speed" Star Speed Levitch Talks Times Square's Shame &amp; Conversing With Inanimate Objects | publisher=Complex Media | work=Complex.com | date=September 9, 2012 | accessdate=September 13, 2012 | author=Monroe, Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levitch is a member of The Ongoing Wow, a band in which he does spoken word over improvised music with Gals Panic and The Sinus Show member Jerm Pollet.

In 2007, Levitch moved to Kansas City and is starting a tour business called "Taste of KC."

In drawing a conjunction between science and religion, Burgess said that one's choice of explanation was "faith versus faith", and that "either you have faith in [[evolution]] or faith in [[Creationism|creation]]". Burgess went on to concede "that the Earth has the appearance of great age" on the grounds that "the bible says that God created a mature Earth, and a mature universe, with Adam mature, and trees being mature". The interviewer quizzed Burgess on the matter of a deceptive God. In his response, Burgess explained, "when man came into the universe he would have that fully functioning universe ready to enjoy". In response to further challenges, Burgess said that the [[Big Bang]] is a religious faith, which contradicts the [[Thermodynamics|first law of thermodynamics]]. In his penultimate question, the interviewer, William Crawley, asked Burgess "You're not concerned that you're messing up the minds of young people by giving them the impression that they have to commit scientific suicide in order to be believers?" to which Burgess responded: "My main concern, is that on the day of [[Last Judgment|Judgment]], people will not say to God 'my excuse is the theory of evolution', for not believing in God, because God will say that is not an excuse". — [http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/religion/sundaysequence/archive-churchstories.shtml Sunday Sequence - Finding God in the Universe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117171852/http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/religion/sundaysequence/archive-churchstories.shtml |date=2006-01-17 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Information pack===
In September 2006, Truth in Science sent resource packs on intelligent design to the heads of science of all United Kingdom secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/5392096.stm BBC News - 'Design' attack on school science].&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[New Scientist]], 59 schools around the United Kingdom used, or planned to use the Truth in Science information packs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/evolution/mg19225803.300-creationism-creeps-into-uk-schools.html New Scientist - Creationism creeps into UK schools].&lt;/ref&gt; The New Scientist article stated that Truth in Science circulated the material with the intention of countering the teaching of evolution in science classes, and that the information packs "promote the notion that life on Earth was created through intelligent design, a [[euphemism]] for the biblical story of creation".

The BBC News website reported the reaction to the information packs from the United Kingdom [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]: "Neither creationism nor intelligent design are taught as a subject in schools, and are not specified in the science curriculum. The national curriculum for science clearly sets down that pupils should be taught that the fossil record is evidence for [[evolution]], and how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/5392096.stm ''`Design` attack on school science: Parents are being encouraged to challenge their children`s science teachers over what they are explaining as the origins of life.''], BBC News, Friday, September 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; -- ''DfES Spokesperson, BBC News''.

In answer to a question regarding what the Secretary of State for Education and Skills would do in response to the information packs, Knight said:

{{Quotation|"Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum, the Truth in Science information pack is therefore not an appropriate resource to support the science curriculum. The national curriculum for science clearly sets down that pupils should be taught: how uncertainties in scientific knowledge and scientific ideas change over time; the role of the scientific community in validating these changes; variation within species can lead to evolutionary changes; and, similarities and differences between species can be measured and classified,"&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061101/text/61101w0010.htm#0611021004183  House of Commons Hansard Written Answers for 01 Nov 2006 (pt 0001)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
In December 2006, [[Colin Slee]], the Dean of Southwark, said: "Everything needs to be explored, so that children can ask sensible questions. Though I see no huge difficulty with exploring intelligent design or creationism or flat Earth, they happen to be misguided, foolish and flying in the face of all evidence. I see no problem with Darwinian theory and Christian faith going hand in hand",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2524442_1,00.html Creationism gains foothold in schools - Times Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; -- ''Colin Slee, Dean of Southwark, The Times, December 2006''.

[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/ Ekklesia], a United Kingdom theological think-tank accused Truth in Science and the advocates of intelligent design of misrepresenting the bible, and that creationism and intelligent design are not on par with accepted scientific theories. According to one Ekklesia contributor, Geologist and Anglican vicar Michael Roberts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060925roberts.shtml Ekklesia - Creationism distorts truth in science, says vicar]&lt;/ref&gt; the material on the Truth in Science website is carefully packaged to hide its [[Young Earth Creationism|young Earth creationist]] roots.&lt;ref&gt;"The material on the website is carefully packaged, and its YEC roots, and thus its scientific worthlessness, may not be immediately apparent to the undiscerning."

They also distort mature Christian understandings of the universe as coming into being through the whole world process, not through reversals or denials of that process. The roots of creationism, whether in its ‘hard’ form, or in attenuated ID ideas, lie not in science but in misinterpretations of the Bible. Claims that such notions can be justified from a ‘literal’ reading of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] are nonsensensical. This book has not one, but two ‘creation stories’. They differ widely in detail, are highly figurative, and were written to combat fatalistic Ancient Near East cosmogonies by stressing the underlying goodness of the world as a gift of God, not to comment on modern scientific matters"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060925evolut.shtml Ekklesia - UK anti-evolutionists seek to lure parents with new website]&lt;/ref&gt; -- ''Ekklesia, 25 September 2006.''

===Secular===
In response to the introduction of intelligent design to European schools, the [[Royal Society]] stated that "intelligent design has far more in common with a religious belief in creationism than it has with science" and raised concerns that "young people are poorly served by deliberate attempts to withhold, distort or misrepresent scientific knowledge and understanding in order to promote particular religious beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;"The Royal Society fully supports questioning and debate in science lessons, as long as it is not designed to undermine young people's confidence in the value of scientific evidence." Some proponents of an alternative explanation for the diversity of life on Earth now claim that their theories are based on scientific evidence. One such view is presented as the theory of intelligent design. This proposes that some species are too complex to have evolved through natural selection and that therefore life on Earth must be the product of a 'designer'. Its supporters make only selective reference to the overwhelming scientific evidence that supports evolution, and treat gaps in current knowledge which, as in all areas of science, certainly exist - as if they were evidence for a 'designer'. In this respect, intelligent design has far more in common with a religious belief in creationism than it has with science, which is based on evidence acquired through experiment and observation. The theory of evolution is supported by the weight of scientific evidence; the theory of intelligent design is not." [http://www.royalsoc.ac.uk/news.asp?id=4298 Royal Society statement on evolution, creationism and intelligent design]&lt;/ref&gt; In a Guardian newspaper article, dated 27 November 2006, Professor [[Lewis Wolpert]] of [[University College London]], attacked intelligent design, and the ambitions of Truth in Science: "There is just no evidence for intelligent design, it is pure religion and has nothing to do with science. It should be banned from science classes".&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,1957858,00.html Revealed: rise of creationism  in UK schools - Guardian Unlimited.]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, a science organization called ''Science, Just Science'' reviewed the DVD information packs sent by Truth in Science to the heads of science at all United Kingdom secondary schools in September 2006.

The online '''Virtual Museum of Modern Nigerian Art''' is a non-commercial initiative whose primary aim is to provide an easily accessible educational resource that can serve as a first point of reference for students, teachers and art enthusiasts interested in learning about modern and contemporary art in [[Nigeria]].{{fact|date=January 2016}} It is operated by the [[Pan-Atlantic University]] in [[Lagos]], Nigeria, the parent body of the [[Lagos Business School]].

The [[virtual museum]] went live in the second quarter of 2011, although preliminary work had already started. The initiative was by Jess Castellote, a [[Spain|Spanish]] architect, and the Virtual museum is managed by Akinyemi Adetunji. It has four virtual floors and over a dozen gallery rooms, each of which is dedicated to a specific period or to a given school.
The interactive website now features about 800 works from different artists, including pioneering Nigerian artists such as [[Aina Onabolu]] and [[Bruce Onobrakpeya]], and emerging artists such as Richardson Ovbiebo and Babalola Lawson.

Some of the objects are held in private collections and are on public display for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The virtual museum complements the [[Nigerian National Museum]], opened in 1957 in the city of [[Lagos]]. While the National Museum has an excellent collection that includes works from 900–200 BC, it lacks [[Contemporary art|contemporary work]]; the virtual museum fills this gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |date=13 September 2011
 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Castellote has said that he hopes the virtual museum will help unknown Nigerian artists who have produced great works to become better known. He acknowledges that there may be problems, such as ensuring [[authenticity in art|authenticity]] and accuracy of information, but describes the site as a work in progress that will constantly evolve and improve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2011-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sections of the website resemble rooms and are modelled after major art schools and styles in Nigeria, with the exception of a few rooms dedicated to masters like Ben Enwinwu and [[Bruce Onobrakpeya]], an octogenarian print artist. Featured in the virtual museum are approximately 80 artists, randomly distributed among the rooms. The list is subjective, though prominence and impact on contemporary Nigerian art is a yardstick employed in the selection. The Virtual Museum started small, but plans to build into one of the top educational resources on Nigerian art. The virtual museum will help disseminate and add to the body of existing knowledge on contemporary art in Nigeria. The artwork online are spread to accommodate all themes, styles and type of works (painting, sculpture, materialism, etc.) with major focus currently centred on painting and sculpture. The Virtual Museum is working with Nigerian artists and collectors to pool these works. For protection of artists’ and collectors’ rights, all reproductions/representations of artwork identify the artist who created them and the collection the works belong to; moreover, these artworks are reproduced in low resolution (72 dpi) so as to render them of little commercial use. Adequate consent and permission is requested before works are displayed. The website also provides external links to articles, papers, journals, or other domains providing added information on a subject or artist; this helps users gain a rounded knowledge.

The Vocational Qualification Transfer System (VQTS) model is a proposal for a structured description of work-related [[Competence (human resources)|competences]]. The core elements are the Competence Matrix and the Competence Profiles. A Competence Matrix displays competences structurally in a table according to core work tasks in a specific occupational field (“competence area”) and the progress of competence development (“step of competence development”). Competence Profiles are formed from individual parts of this Competence Matrix.   
In the context of [https://web.archive.org/web/20120104203331/http://ec.europa.eu/education/lifelong-learning-policy/doc50_en.htm ECVET] the VQTS project sought to support the transnational mobility of learners. A Competence Matrix can be used for the development of qualifications, training programmes, and job profiles, as well as for [[Strategic human resource planning|human resource planning]], the allocation of qualifications to the [[National Qualifications Framework|Qualifications Framework]], and for developing higher permeability between [[vocational education]] and [[higher education]].

== Goals ==
The main goal of the VQTS model is the development of a systematic process for the comparison of competences and qualifications, and for the transnational transfer of competences acquired abroad (for example between education and working environment, or between vocational and higher education).

== Structure ==
=== Competence Matrix ===
[[File:VQTS Matrix Mechatronics.pdf|thumb|VQTS Matrix Mechatronics|Chart 1: Competence Matrix Mechatronics]]
[[File:VQTS Matrix Electronics.pdf|thumb|VQTS Matrix Electronics|Chart 2: Competence Matrix Electronics]]

A Competence Matrix displays competences in a table according to core work tasks and the progress of competence development. Competence areas and steps of competence development are described in the table. 
* The left hand column of the table contains competence areas, based on the various core work tasks.
* The acquisitions of competences, from beginner level to “skilled worker” level, are described for each competence area. Each competence described is a “step of competence development”.
The structure and different ranges of Competence Matrices can be shown by these examples: 
* Competence Matrix “[[mechatronics]] (chart 1)“: Developed in VQTS I, this Matrix focuses on the development of competences required from workers at beginner level to skilled worker level.
* Competence Matrix for “electronics/[[electrical engineering]]” (chart 2): The VQTS II project intended to develop a Competence Matrix to be used to identify areas of overlap between [[Vocational education|VET]] and HE programmes. Therefore, the scope of the Competence Matrix ‘electronics/electrical engineering’ had to be broadened to include at least some steps of competence development relevant to HE.

A Competence Matrix can be developed via a moderated workshop using experts from the respective areas. Within the VQTS model it is assumed that 5-25 competence areas will be defined per occupational field, and 2-6 steps of the competence development process described for each competence area. 
It is not easy to describe competences, because they depend on a variety of characteristics and may be localised in different manners. There are no specific determinants for differentiating the steps in the model. Several dimensions could be:

Ability to 
* perform independent work tasks
* deal with a certain complexity
* deal with quality standard demands
* deal with dynamic situations
* deal with non-transparency.
Competences in this model refer to cognitive competences (knowledge), functional competences (skills) as well as social competences (behaviour).

=== Competence Profiles ===
Competence Profiles are formed from particular parts of a Competence Matrix by identifying competences that are relevant to a certain training programme or qualification (organisational profile) or are reflective the competences acquired so far by a person in training (individual profile).
Organisational profiles, developed by the authorities responsible for the respective training programmes or qualification, indicate the relevant competences of the specific training programme or qualification on the Competence Matrix and the corresponding number of Credit Points. Individual profiles, developed by the responsible training provider, assess which stage of competence development and Credit Points the student or apprentice has reached so far.
Based on the competence profile of the person in training a Competence Profile Certificate can be issued.

== Applications ==
A Competence Matrix can be used for those purposes where the transparency of competence profiles is very important, such as:
* transferring vocational competences acquired abroad (mobility in VET);
* transferring and recognising competences acquired within the official VET system as well as competences achieved through [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]] or [[informal learning]];
* developing qualifications (for use in the development of the [[European Qualifications Framework|EQF]]);
* composing job profiles as well as personnel (human resources) planning;
* referencing qualifications to qualifications frameworks;
* enhancing permeability between VET and HE.
For examples for applications see [http://www.vocationalqualification.net/ VQTS Website].

== Background ==
=== Projects ===
The VQTS models were coordinated by 3s under the “[[Leonardo da Vinci programme|Leonardo da Vinci Programme]]":
* VQTS I (2003–2006) with partners from Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom
* VQTS II (2007–2009) with partners from Austria, Czech Republic, Germany, Malta, the Netherlands and Slovenia

=== Context of educational policy ===
The VQTS project was closely aligned with the aims of the ‘[http://ec.europa.eu/education/vocational-education/doc1143_en.htm Copenhagen Process]’ wherein the EU countries declared their willingness to foster employability and [[lifelong learning]] in Europe by strengthening cooperation and increasing mobility in vocational education and training (VET). According to the ‘Copenhagen Process’, it should be possible to utilise competences acquired through formal, non-formal and informal learning throughout Europe. The VQTS model is one of the best instruments to implement ECVET and increase the (international) transparency and comparability of qualifications and training offers.

== Awards ==
The VQTS I project received the [http://www.minedu.fi/vet2006/Helsinki_Award.html Helsinki Award] 2006 in the ‘Recognition of competences and qualifications, ECVET’ category, and the gold [http://www.lebenslanges-lernen.at/award2011 Lifelong Learning Award] 2007 for its contributions to the aims of the ‘Copenhagen Process’. 
The VQTS II project received the "Best Projects 2007" label in [http://www.adam-europe.eu/adam/thematicgroup/MMVII ADAM], the project and product portal for Leonardo da Vinci. 
These projects have strongly contributed to improvements in vocational education and training in Europe in recent years.

'''"When We Die As Martyrs"''' is a song produced by the popular [[Jordan]]ian children's music troupe ''The Birds of Paradise'' and performed as a [[music video]] on a [[Bahrain]]ian television channel of the same name. Sung by young [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] children, in 2010 the song became a hit on [[YouTube]] as well as Arabic and worldwide websites.&lt;ref name="ha" &gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/new-hit-song-for-palestinian-children-when-we-die-as-martyrs-1.297731 |author = Haaretz Service |title=New hit song for Palestinian children: When we die as martyrs  |work=[[Haaretz]]  |date=  June 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was harshly criticized by [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] journalist Fawzia Nasir al-Naeem, who argues that it indoctrinates children into bloodshed and [[terrorism]].&lt;ref name="ha"/&gt;

==Background==
The choir ''The Birds of Paradise'' was founded in 1994 by [[Jordanian people|Jordanian]]-[[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] [[businessman]] Khaled Maqdad. The television channel, which began operating in 2008, was also established by Maqdad, who says: "The channel has captured the hearts of millions of children. It succeeds where the educational system has failed, such as multiplication table songs. It helps teachers work on it with the children."&lt;ref name=IN /&gt;

[[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] journalist Fawzia Nasir al-Naeem wrote that the choir "is one of the most widely distributed children's song groups in the Arab world, and it seems to have crossed the ocean to Canada and Britain."&lt;ref name=" ha" /&gt; Dr. Hamad Al-Majid, a journalist and former member of the official Saudi National Organization for [[Human Rights]], writes: "Birds of Paradise produced content has swept Arab satellite channels, becoming some of the most popular programming for Arab children. This company pursues a policy of resisting Israeli occupation via producing innocent songs for children, and some of these songs which can be found on YouTube have been viewed by as many as four million people."&lt;ref name=Hamad &gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=23306|author = Dr. Hamad Al-Majid |title=Israel Fear Our Birds of Paradise |publisher=www.aawsat.com|date= 07/12/2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The song's video portrays Palestinian children playing, singing and dancing in a village, when they are gunned down by other children, dressed as [[Israel]]i soldiers. The children portraying Israeli soldiers are wearing [[yarmulke]]s. At the end of the video, other Palestinian children avenge the killing of their friends by killing the "Israeli" children.&lt;ref name=Qatar &gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.qatar-tribune.com/data/20100804/content.asp?section=gulf1_6 |author =  |title=Children’s group to glorify ‘martyrdom’ in Gaza outdoor concert |publisher=[[Qatar Tribune]]|year=   2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song begins with a young girl singing: "When we seek martyrdom, we go to heaven. You tell us we're small, but from this way of life we have..."{{cn|date=July 2016}}

As the video progresses, a young man continues the song: "Children, we must keep our religious commandments. There is no god but [[Allah]], and Allah loves [[Shahid|shaheed]]s" (Islamic martyrs).&lt;ref name=IN &gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3909134,00.html|author = Roee Nahmias  |title=Arab song for kids: Allah loves martyrs|publisher=Israel news|date=  June 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaza City concerts==
In August 2010, the Birds of Paradise gave two live performances in [[Gaza City]], where Muqdad, the founder of the group, attended a formal welcoming ceremony given by [[Hamas]] in the honor of the choir. Muqdad said that the concert would "affirm to the entire world the right of the children of Palestine to live in freedom and dignity."&lt;ref name=Qatar /&gt;&lt;ref name=herald &gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10663462|author =  |title=Children's group to glorify 'martyrdom' in Gaza concert|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=  August 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concerts were performed during an Islamic music festival, and both were attended by thousands of people, who were "blown away" by the young performers.&lt;ref name="Daily Star" &gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=4&amp;Article_id=117892#axzz18a8KIqD3|author =  |title=Gaza City blown away by Little Birds of Paradise troupe |publisher=[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|Daily Star]]|date= August 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
