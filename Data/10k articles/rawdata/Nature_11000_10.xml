'''6L6''' is the designator for a [[vacuum tube]] introduced by [[Radio Corporation of America]] in July 1936. At the time [[Philips]] had already developed and patented power [[pentode]] designs, which were rapidly replacing power [[triode]]s due to their greater efficiency. The [[beam tetrode]] design of the 6L6 allowed RCA to circumvent Philips' pentode patent.

== History ==
The 6L6 is a descendant of the "Harries Valve" developed by British engineer [[J. Owen Harries]] and marketed by the [[Hivac Co. Ltd.]] in 1935. Harries is believed{{By whom?|date=November 2013}} to have been the first engineer to discover the "critical distance" effect, which maximized the efficiency of a power [[tetrode]], by positioning its [[anode]] at a distance which is a specific multiple of the [[screen grid]]-[[cathode]] distance. This design also minimized interference of [[secondary emission]] electrons dislodged from the anode.

EMI engineers [[Cabot Bull]] and [[Sidney Rodda]] improved the Harries design with a pair of beam plates, connected to the cathode, which directed the electron streams into two narrow areas and also acted like a [[suppressor grid]] to redirect some secondary electrons back to the anode. The beam tetrode design was also undertaken to avoid the patents which the giant [[Philips]] firm held on power [[pentode]]s in Europe. Because this overall design eliminated the "tetrode kink" (negative resistance) in the lower parts of the tetrode's voltage-current characteristic curves, which sometimes caused tetrode [[amplifier]]s to become unstable, MOV ([[Marconi-Osram Valve]], a subsidiary of [[EMI]] jointly owned with [[General Electric Company plc|General Electric Company Ltd]]) marketed this tube family under the sobriquet "KT", meaning "kinkless tetrode".

Because MOV's engineers did not feel the kinkless tetrode could be successfully mass-produced, they licensed the design to RCA. This proved to be a poor business decision on MOV's part. RCA subsequently had enormous success with the 6L6. It replaced the use of power triodes in public-address amplifiers almost overnight. So many applications were found for the 6L6 that a complete list would be impossible to assemble. MOV introduced their version, the [[KT66]], a year later.

[[File:Sovtek 5881 vacuum tube.jpg|200px|left]]
RCA's first version was an early [[Tube socket#Octal|octal base]] tube. Like most with this base it had a metal, rather than glass, envelope. Later versions, including the 6L6G, 6L6GA, 6L6GB, 5881, 5932, 7027, and the final version 6L6GC had glass envelopes, which made [[thermal radiation|radiation]] cooling of the anode easier. The voltage and power rating of the 6L6 series were gradually pushed upwards by adding features such as a [https://web.archive.org/web/20110819185840/http://www.antiquewireless.org/otb/vt0108.htm Micanol] base, thicker plates, thicker grid wires, grid cooling fins, and special ultra-black plate coatings.  The original metal version was rated for 19 watts dissipation while the later 6L6GC is usually rated for 30 watts. A "W" in the descriptor, as in 6L6WGB, identifies the tube as designed for mechanically rugged environments, such as military or airborne use.

== Variations ==
Early variations included transmitting tubes such as the [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]] (1937) with 6.3V heater, plate (anode) connected to a top cap, and equivalent 12.6V 1625, the smaller [[6V6]] (1936), the many KT versions marketed in Europe, and a subsequent vast array of audio and RF power tubes. One of the largest-volume post-WWII applications was in the basic design of television sweep power tubes, starting with the 6BG6G (1946), a modified [[807 (vacuum tube)|807]]. TV designs rarely used [[transistor]]s in place of sweep tubes—a challenging high-power and high-speed application—until the 1970s.

The 807 was preferred to the similar 6L6 by [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts because high transient voltages on the 6L6's anode when operating in class C could cause a [[electric arc|flashover]] between pins 2 and 3 on the octal base, whereas this was not a problem with the top-cap anode of the otherwise identical 807, physically distant from all the base pins.

In guitar amplifiers, this flashover problem sometimes occurs if the amplifier is operated without the speakers connected, causing the [[self inductance]] of the output [[transformer]] primary winding to generate high voltages when the current changes due to the applied signal. For this reason the speaker terminals of 6L6 tube amplifiers are sometimes short-circuited by a switching 6.3&amp;nbsp;mm jack when the speakers are disconnected.

Further testimony for this device's success would be even simpler: {{As of|2012|lc=on}} the 6L6GC version was still being manufactured and used, primarily in [[guitar amplifier]]s. Manufacture continued in [[Russia]] (two factories), [[China]] (two factories), and [[Slovakia]].    (In 2006, Ei Electronics in [[Serbia]] discontinued making tubes.) The 6L6 has had one of the longest active lifetimes of any electronic component, more than 70 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3201">'''Assimilative capacity''' refers to the ability of a body of [[water]] to cleanse itself; its capacity to 
receive [[waste water]]s or [[toxic substance]]s without deleterious effects and without damage to [[aquatic life]] or humans who consume the water. 
It is level to which water body or nature control the toxicity without affecting the aquatic life.

{{quote|Human health and welfare, food security, industrial development and the ecosystem on which they are all at risk, unless the resources are managed more effectively during the present decade and beyond, than they have to be in the past. The well being of people at present and future demands immediate and effective action. Concerted action is needed to reverse the present trend of inequitable [[resource consumption]], and over increasing shortages and [[environmental degradation]]. A proper management plan is essential for judicious utilization of resources for sustainable development.&lt;br/&gt;
The socio-economic roots of present environmental crisis lie in the paradigm of scientific materialism and economic determination that fail to recognize the physical limits imposed by ecological system on economic activity. The economies must expand within ecosystems that have regenerative capacities. Contrary to neoclassical theory of continuous material growth, economic activities directly determine the potential for development through over exploitation of natural resources and indirectly compromise future production through discharge of residuals. There is a limit to the capability of ecological systems in accepting the residuals without discernable changes in the quality of recipient bodies.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moef.nic.in/divisions/cltech/ac.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009030209/http://moef.nic.in/divisions/cltech/ac.htm |archivedate=2011-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==USA==

Assimilative capacity is a quantitatively useful concept codified in the [[Clean Water Act]] and other laws and regulations that is unrelated to the perception of an [[environmental crisis]].  Assimilative capacity specifically refers to the capacity for a water body to absorb constituents without exceeding a specific concentration, such as a [[water quality]] objective. Water quality objectives are set and periodically revised by regulatory agencies, such as the [[EPA]], to define the limits of water quality for different uses, which include human health, but also other ecologically important functions, [[wildlife]] habitat, [[irrigation|irrigated]] agriculture, etc. For example, if the irrigation water quality objective for salt is 450 mg/L of total dissolved solids, the assimilative capacity of a water body would be the amount of salt that could be added to the water such that it's concentration would not exceed 450 mg/L.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5247">'''Bone ash''' is a white material produced by the [[calcination]] of [[bone]]s. Typical bone ash consists of about 55.82% [[calcium oxide]], 42.39% [[phosphorus pentoxide]], and 1.79% [[water]]. The exact composition of these compounds varies depending upon the type of bones being used, but generally the formula for bone ash is: Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Bone ash usually has a [[density]] around 3.10 g/mL and a [[melting point]] of 1670&amp;nbsp;°C (3038&amp;nbsp;°F). Most bones retain their cellular structure through calcination.

==Uses==
===Bone china===
The raw material for [[bone china]] is about 50% bone ash derived from animal bones. These bones undergo multiple processing stages during which all meat is removed and the bone is completely cleaned. Once cleaned, the bone is heated to about 1000&amp;nbsp;°C (1832&amp;nbsp;°F) so that all additional [[Organic matter|organic]] material is removed from the bone and the bone becomes [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. Lastly, the newly sterilized bone is ground with water into fine particles which can be used as a raw material for bone china. Bone ash plays an important role in the creation of bone china, as the [[phosphate]] of the bone generates beta [[tricalcium phosphate]], and other compounds from the bone create a calcium crystal called [[anorthite]]. Synthetic alternatives [[dicalcium phosphate]] and tricalcium phosphate are used as substitutes for bone ash.  Most bone china are produced with synthetic alternatives rather than bone ash.&lt;ref name=mussi&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mussi|first1=Susan|title=BONE ASH - It also creates teapots. Manufacture|url=http://ceramicdictionary.com/en/b/4031/bone-ash-manufacture|website=Ceramic Dictionary|accessdate=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertilizers===
Bone ash can be used alone as an [[organic fertilizer]] or it can be treated with [[sulfuric acid]] to form a "single [[superphosphate]]" fertilizer which is more [[water soluble]]:&lt;ref name=Apatites&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ptáček|first1=Petr|title=Apatites and their Synthetic Analogues - Synthesis, Structure, Properties and Applications|date=2016|publisher=InTech|isbn=9789535122661|pages=437-440|doi=10.5772/62216}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

:[[Tricalcium phosphate|Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 2 [[Sulfuric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 [[gypsum|CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Monocalcium phosphate|Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]·[[Water of crystallization|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]

Similarly, [[phosphoric acid]] can be used to form "triple superphosphate", a more concentrated phosphorus fertilizer which excludes the [[gypsum]] content found in single superphosphate:&lt;ref name=Apatites/&gt;

:Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 [[Phosphoric acid|H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] → 3 [[Monocalcium phosphate|Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

===Machining===
Bone ash is used in [[machine shop]]s for various purposes. Examples include [[Polishing (metalworking)|polishing]] [[Chemical compound|compounds]], protective [[powder coating]]s for [[metal]] tools, and as a [[sealant]] for seams and cracks.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} As a powder coating, bone ash has many unique characteristics. First of all, the powder has high [[thermal stability]], so it maintains its form in extremely high temperatures. The powder coating itself adheres to metal well and does not drip, run, cause much [[corrosion]], or create noticeable streaks. Using the bone ash is easy as well, as it comes in a powder form, is easy to clean up, and does not separate into smaller parts (therefore requiring no extra mixing).

===Metallurgy===
Bone ash is a material often used in [[cupellation]], a process by which [[precious metal]]s (such as [[gold]] and [[silver]]) are removed from [[base metal]]s.

In cupellation, base metals in an impure sample are oxidized with the help of [[lead]] and are vaporized and absorbed into a porous cupellation material, typically made of [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]]. This leaves the precious metals which do not oxidize behind. Bone ash's extremely porous and calcareous structure as well as its high melting point makes it an ideal candidate for cupellation.&lt;ref&gt;The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica. "Cupellation." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc., 29 May 2017, www.britannica.com/technology/cupellation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bayley, Justine. "Precious Metal Refining." Archeological Datasheet, no. 2, Mar. 1995, pp. 1–1., doi:10.1016/s0026-0576(03)80479-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roman mythology]], the '''Camenae''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|m|iː|n|iː}}; also ''Casmenae'', ''Camoenae'') were originally goddesses of childbirth, wells and fountains, and also prophetic deities.

==List of Camenae==
There were four Camenae: 
*'''[[Carmenta]]''', or '''Carmentis'''
*'''[[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]]''', or '''Ægeria''', or '''Aegeria'''
*'''[[Antevorta]]''', or '''Porrima'''
*'''[[Postverta]]''', or '''Postvorta''', or '''Prorsa'''

The last two were sometimes specifically referred to as the '''Carmentae''', and in ancient times might have been two aspects of Carmenta rather than separate figures; in later times, however, they are distinct beings believed to protect women in labour.

Carmenta was chief among the nymphs. Her festival day, the [[Carmentalia]], featured water ritually drawn by [[Vestal Virgin]]s from the spring outside the [[Porta Capena]].

The Camenae were later identified with the [[Greek mythology|Greek]] [[Muses]]; in his translation of [[Homer|Homer's]] ''Odyssey'', [[Livius Andronicus]] rendered the Greek word ''Mousa'' as ''Camena'', and [[Horace]] refers to poetic inspiration as the "soft breath of the Greek Camena" (spiritum Graiae tenuem Camenae) in [[Odes (Horace)|Odes]] II.16.

The '''Christmas pickle''' is a [[Christmas]] tradition for some people in the United States. A decoration in the shape of a [[Pickled cucumber|pickle]] is hidden on a [[Christmas tree]], with the finder receiving either a reward or good fortune for the following year. There are a number of different origin stories attributed to the tradition, including an origination in Germany. This theory has since been discounted, and it is now thought to be an American tradition created in the late 19th century.

==Description==
In the tradition, an ornamental pickle is placed on a [[Christmas tree]] as one of the [[Christmas decorations]]. On Christmas morning, the first child to find the pickle on the tree would receive an extra present from [[Santa Claus]] or would be said to have a year of good [[luck|fortune]].&lt;ref name=tampa/&gt;

[[Berrien Springs, Michigan]] was known as the Christmas pickle capital of the world.&lt;ref name=letsgo/&gt; A pickle parade was held from 1992 until about 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=Leland|title=Stupid Christmas|year=2010|publisher=Andrews McMeel|location=Kansas City, Mo.|isbn=9780740799532|page=88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_zMrnsZufksC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Christmas+pickle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vTixUOGuMJSZ0QXjn4DoDw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Christmas%20pickle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village is in the area of [[Michigan]] known for [[cucumber]] production.&lt;ref name=letsgo&gt;{{cite news|last=Rodeghier|first=Karen|title=Let's Go|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-68829185/let-s-go|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Herald|date=21 December 1999}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
This tradition is commonly believed by Americans to come from [[Germany]] and be referred to as a Weihnachtsgurke,&lt;ref name=gherkinpickle/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Labunski|first=Carla|title=Naperville Settlement Showcases Yule of Yore|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-68879924/naperville-settlement-showcases-yule-of-yore|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Herald|date=12 December 1998}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is probably [[apocryphal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutter|first=David|title=The true story has some folks up a tree, in a real pickle|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-10F7BD14916EB138.html|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=Post-Tribune|date=25 December 2005}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the tradition is completely unknown in Germany.&lt;ref name=gherkinpickle&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Nancy|title=German Gherkin Ornament Puts Historians in a Pickle|url=http://archive.columbiatribune.com/2006/Dec/20061214Life051.asp|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=Columbia Daily Tribune|date=14 December 2006}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tampa/&gt; It has been suggested that the origin of the Christmas pickle may have been developed for marketing purposes in the 1890s to coincide with the importation of glass Christmas tree decorations from Germany. [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworths]] was the first company to import these types of decorations into the United States in 1890,&lt;ref name=gherkinpickle/&gt; and glass blown decorative vegetables were imported from France from 1892 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=Ray B|author2=Browne, Pat|title=The Guide to United States Popular Culture|year=2001|publisher=Bowling Green State University Popular Press|location=Bowling Green, OH|isbn=9780879728229|page=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U3rJxPYT32MC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=glass+vegetable+decorations+germany&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YUuxUNiyJeaX1AXF5IH4Dg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=glass%20vegetable%20decorations%20germany&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the evidence showing that the tradition did not originate in Germany, the concept of Christmas pickles has since been imported from the United States and they are now on sale in the country traditionally associated with it.&lt;ref name=gherkinpickle/&gt;

One suggested origin has been that the tradition came from [[Camp Sumter]] during the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Bavaria]]n-born Private John C. Lower had enlisted in the 103rd Pennsylvania Infantry, but was captured in April 1864 and taken to the prison camp. As the story is told, on [[Christmas Eve]] he begged a guard for a pickle while starving. The guard provided the pickle, which Lower later credited for saving his life. After returning to his family, he began a tradition of hiding a pickle on their Christmas tree each year.

Another origin which comes from Berrien Springs is a [[Victorian era]] tale of St. Nicholas saving two Spanish children who were trapped in a barrel of pickles by an innkeeper.&lt;ref name=tampa&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why do some people hang ornaments that look like pickles on their Christmas trees?|journal=Tampa Bay Magazine|date=November–December 2011|page=91|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwdRUx4dNA4C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;dq=Christmas+pickle&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vTixUOGuMJSZ0QXjn4DoDw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christmas%20pickle&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Strange History of Traditions around the World|url=https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-212404396/the-strange-history-of-traditions-around-the-world|accessdate=24 November 2012|newspaper=South Wales Echo|date=19 November 1999}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''cloud drop effective radius''' (alternatively '''cloud effective radius''' or '''effective radius''') is a [[weighted mean]] of the size distribution of cloud droplets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |title=Cloud Effective Radius |work=Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center |accessdate=3 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155507/http://disc.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/PIP/shtml/cloud_effective_radius.shtml |archivedate=24 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was defined in 1974 by [[James E. Hansen]] and [[Larry Travis]] as the ratio of the third to the second [[moment (mathematics)|moment]] of a droplet size distribution to aid in the [[inverse problem|inversion]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen., J.E. and L.D. Travis |title=Light scattering in planetary atmospheres |journal=[[Space Science Reviews]] |volume=16 |issue =4 |year=1974 |doi=10.1007/BF00168069 |pages=527–610 |bibcode=1974SSRv...16..527H}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, it is an area weighted radius of the cloud drop particles.

Mathematically, this can be expressed as
&lt;math&gt;r_e = \dfrac{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^3 \cdot n(r)\,dr}{\int\limits_{0}^{\infty} \pi \cdot r^2 \cdot n(r)\,dr}&lt;/math&gt;.

The global effective particle radius has different values for water and ice clouds: the former is around 14 μm, whereas for ice it is around 25 μm. Studies also indicate that the effective cloud droplet radius is larger over oceans than over ground by 15%-20%. By contrast, the difference in the ice particle size over land and oceans is much smaller (only 5%).&lt;ref name = "2013stubenrauch"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7927">A '''deep-focus earthquake''' in [[seismology]] (also called a plutonic earthquake) is an [[earthquake]] with a [[hypocenter]] depth exceeding 300&amp;nbsp;km. They occur almost exclusively at [[convergent boundary|convergent boundaries]] in association with subducted oceanic [[lithosphere]]. They occur along a dipping tabular zone beneath the subduction zone known as the [[Wadati–Benioff zone]].&lt;ref name=Frolich1989&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frolich |first=Cliff |title=The Nature of Deep-Focus Earthquakes |journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences |year=1989 |volume=17 |pages=227–254 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ea.17.050189.001303 |bibcode=1989AREPS..17..227F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discovery ==

Preliminary evidence for the existence of deep-focus earthquakes was first brought to the attention of the scientific community in 1922 by [[Herbert Hall Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Harry W.|title=The mechanics of deep earthquakes|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|date=995|volume=23|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.23.1.169 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, [[Kiyoo Wadati]] proved the existence of earthquakes occurring well beneath the lithosphere, dispelling the notion that earthquakes occur only with shallow focal depths.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt;

== Seismic characteristics ==

Deep-focus earthquakes give rise to minimal [[surface wave]]s.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt; Their focal depth causes the earthquakes to be less likely to produce [[seismic wave]] motion with energy concentrated at the surface. The path of deep-focus earthquake seismic waves from focus to recording station goes through the heterogeneous upper [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] and highly variable [[crust (geology)|crust]] only once.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt; Therefore, the body waves undergo less [[attenuation]] and [[reverberation]] than seismic waves from shallow earthquakes, resulting in sharp body wave peaks.

== Focal mechanisms ==

The pattern of energy radiation of an earthquake is represented by the [[moment tensor solution]], which is graphically represented by beachball diagrams. An explosive or implosive mechanism produces an isotropic seismic source. Slip on a planar fault surface results in what is known as a double-couple source. Uniform outward motion in a single plane due to normal shortening gives rise is known as a compensated linear vector [[dipole]] source.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt; Deep-focus earthquakes have been shown to contain a combination of these sources.

== Physical process ==
Shallow-focus earthquakes are the result of the sudden release of [[strain energy]] built up over time in rock by [[brittle fracture]] and frictional slip over planar surfaces.&lt;ref name="KeareyKlepeis2013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kearey |first1=Philip |author2=Keith A. Klepeis |author3=[[Frederick J. Vine]] |title=Global Tectonics |edition=3 |year=2013 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=1-118-68808-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the physical mechanism of deep focus earthquakes is poorly understood. Subducted lithosphere subject to the [[pressure]] and [[temperature]] regime at depths greater than 300&amp;nbsp;km should not exhibit brittle behavior, but should rather respond to stress by [[plastic deformation]].&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006&gt;{{cite book |last=Frohlich |first=Cliff |title=Deep Earthquakes |year=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-82869-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several physical mechanisms have been proposed for the nucleation and propagation of deep-focus earthquakes; however, the exact process remains an outstanding problem in the field of deep earth seismology.

The following four subsections outline proposals which could explain the physical mechanism allowing deep focus earthquakes to occur. With the exception of solid-solid [[phase transitions]], the proposed theories for the focal mechanism of deep earthquakes hold equal footing in current scientific literature.

=== Solid-solid phase transitions ===

The earliest proposed mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is an [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] due to a phase transition of material to a higher [[density]], lower volume phase.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt; The [[olivine]]-[[spinel]] phase transition is thought to occur at a depth of 410&amp;nbsp;km in the interior of the earth. This hypothesis proposes that metastable olivine in oceanic lithosphere subducted to depths greater than 410&amp;nbsp;km undergoes a sudden phase transition to spinel structure. The increase in density due to the reaction would cause an implosion giving rise to the earthquake. This mechanism has been largely discredited due to the lack of a significant [[isotropic]] signature in the moment tensor solution of deep-focus earthquakes.&lt;ref name=Frolich1989 /&gt;

=== Dehydration embrittlement ===

Dehydration reactions of mineral phases with high weight percent water would increase the [[pore pressure]] in a subducted oceanic lithosphere slab. This effect reduces the effective normal stress in the slab and allow slip to occur on pre-existing fault planes at significantly greater depths that would normally be possible.&lt;ref name=Frolich1989 /&gt; Several workers{{Who|date=May 2015}} suggest that this mechanism does not play a significant role in seismic activity beyond 350&amp;nbsp;km depth due to the fact that most dehydration reactions will have reached completion by a pressure corresponding to 150 to 300&amp;nbsp;km depth (5-10 GPa).&lt;ref name=Frolich1989 /&gt;

=== Transformational faulting or anticrack faulting ===

Transformational faulting, also known as anticrack faulting, is the result of the phase transition of a mineral to a higher density phase occurring in response to shear stress in a fine-grained shear zone. The transformation occurs along the plane of maximal shear stress. Rapid shearing can then occur along these planes of weakness, giving rise to an earthquake in a mechanism similar to a shallow-focus earthquake. [[Metastable]] olivine subducted past the olivine-[[wadsleyite]] transition at 320--410&amp;nbsp;km depth (depending on temperature) is a potential candidate for such instabilities.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt; Arguments against this hypothesis include the requirements that the faulting region should be very cold, and contain very little mineral-bound hydroxyl. Higher temperatures or higher hydroxyl contents preclude the metastable preservation of olivine to the depths of the deepest earthquakes.

=== Shear instability / thermal runaway ===

A shear instability arises when heat is produced by plastic deformation faster than it can be conducted away. The result is [[thermal runaway]], a [[positive feedback]] loop of heating, material weakening and strain-localisation within the shear zone.&lt;ref name=Frohlich2006 /&gt; Continued weakening may result in partial melting along zones of maximal shear stress. Plastic shear instabilities leading to earthquakes have not been documented in nature, nor have they been observed in natural materials in the laboratory. Their relevance to deep earthquakes therefore lies in mathematical models which use simplified material properties and rheologies to simulate natural conditions.

== Notable deep-focus earthquakes ==

The strongest deep-focus earthquake in seismic record was the magnitude 8.3 [[2013 Okhotsk Sea earthquake|Okhotsk Sea earthquake]] that occurred at a depth of 609 km in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usb000h4jh#summary | title=M8.3 - Sea of Okhotsk | publisher=USGS | date=2013-05-25 | accessdate=2013-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deepest earthquake ever recorded was a small 4.2 earthquake in Vanuatu at a depth of 735.8 km in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/usp000cryq#executive|title=M 4.2 - Vanuatu region|website=earthquake.usgs.gov|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2963">In [[botany]], a '''diaspore''' is a plant dispersal unit consisting of a [[seed]] or [[spore]] plus any additional tissues that assist dispersal.  In some [[seed plants]], the diaspore is a seed and fruit together, or a seed and [[elaiosome]]. In a few seed plants, the diaspore is most or all of the plant, and is known as a [[tumbleweed]].

Diaspores are common in [[weed]]y and [[ruderal species]].  Collectively, diaspores, seeds, and spores that have been modified for migration are known as ''disseminules''.

==Role in dispersal==
A diaspore of seed plus elaiosome is a common adaptation to [[seed dispersal]] by ants ([[myrmecochory]]).  This is most notable in [[Australia]]n and [[South Africa]]n [[sclerophyll]] plant communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:A Taraxacum Ruderalia dandelion clock.jpg|thumb|Achenes of a dandelion (''[[Taraxacum]]'')]]
A diaspore of seed(s) plus fruit is common in plants dispersed by [[frugivore]]s. Fruit-eating bats typically carry the diaspore to a favorite perch, where they eat the fruit and discard the seed.  Fruit-eating birds typically swallow small seeds but, like bats, may carry larger seeded fruits to a perch where they eat the fruit and discard the seed.  Diaspores such as [[achene]]s and [[Samara (fruit)|samara]]e are dispersed primarily by [[wind]];  samaras are dispersed also by sailing or tumbling as they fall in still air.  [[Drift fruit]]s and some others are dispersed by water.

[[Tumbleweed]]s are dispersed by wind, sometimes over very long distances.  These occur in a variety of [[weed]]y and [[ruderal species]] native to [[steppe]]s and [[desert]]s. [[Grass]]es have various units of dispersal: rarely the [[caryopsis]] alone, often a diaspore.&lt;ref name=Gibson2009&gt;{{Cite book| last = Gibson | first =  David J.| year = 2009| title = Grasses and grassland ecology| pages = 52| url = https://books.google.com/?id=5UqVtp0vWKYC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=tumbleweed+like+dispersal| isbn = 0-19-852919-8| publisher = Oxford University Press| location = Oxford| postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Disarticulation occurs below, between, or above the [[glume]]s and at all nodes.&lt;ref name=Gibson2009/&gt;  Although in some species the diaspore is a [[foxtail (diaspore)|foxtail]], in a few (the "tumble grasses") it is like a tumbleweed.

[[File:fibreoptic.jpg|thumb|right|A bundle of [[optical fibers]]]]

'''Fiber''' or '''fibre''' (see [[American and British English spelling differences#-re, -er|spelling differences]], from the [[Latin]] fibra&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fiber}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Natural fiber|natural]] or [[synthetic fiber|synthetic]] substance that is significantly longer than it is wide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Fibers are often used in the manufacture of other materials. The strongest engineering materials often incorporate fibers, for example [[Carbon fibers|carbon fiber]] and [[ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene]].

Synthetic fibers can often be produced very cheaply and in large amounts compared to natural fibers, but for clothing natural fibers can give some benefits, such as comfort, over their synthetic counterparts.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Natural fibers==
{{Main|Natural fiber}}

Natural fibers develop or occur in the fiber shape, and include those produced by plants, animals, and geological processes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Textiles|last = Kadolph|first = Sara|publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]|year = 2002|isbn = 0-13-025443-6|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They can be classified according to their origin:
*[[fiber crop|Vegetable fiber]]s are generally based on arrangements of [[cellulose]], often with [[lignin]]: examples include [[cotton]], [[Cannabis sativa|hemp]], [[jute]], [[flax]], [[ramie]], [[sisal]], [[bagasse]], and [[Banana#Fiber|banana]]. Plant fibers are employed in the manufacture of [[paper]] and [[textile]] (cloth), and [[dietary fiber]] is an important component of human nutrition.
*[[Wood fibre|Wood fiber]], distinguished from vegetable fiber, is from tree sources. Forms include [[groundwood]], [[Lagetta lagetto|lacebark]], thermomechanical pulp (TMP), and bleached or unbleached [[Kraft process|kraft]] or sulfite pulps. Kraft and sulfite (also called sulphite) refer to the type of pulping process used to remove the lignin bonding the original wood structure, thus freeing the fibers for use in paper and [[engineered wood]] products such as [[fiberboard]].
*[[Animal fiber]]s consist largely of particular proteins. Instances are [[silkworm]] [[silk]], [[spider silk]], [[sinew]], [[catgut]], [[wool]], [[sea silk]] and hair such as [[cashmere wool]], [[mohair]] and [[Angora wool|angora]], fur such as sheepskin, rabbit, mink, fox, beaver, etc.
*[[Mineral fiber]]s include the [[asbestos]] group. Asbestos is the only naturally occurring long [[mineral]] fiber. Six minerals have been classified as "asbestos" including [[chrysotile]] of the [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] class and those belonging to the [[amphibole]] class: [[amosite]], [[crocidolite]], [[tremolite]], [[anthophyllite]] and [[actinolite]]. Short, fiber-like minerals include [[wollastonite]] and [[palygorskite]].
*Biological fibers also known as [[fibrous proteins]] or [[protein filament]]s consist largely of biologically relevant and biologically very important proteins, mutations or other genetic defects can lead to [[Collagen#Diseases|severe diseases]]. Instances are [[collagen]]&lt;ref name="Saad 1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Saad|first1=Mohamed|title=Low resolution structure and packing investigations of collagen crystalline domains in tendon using Synchrotron Radiation X-rays, Structure factors determination, evaluation of Isomorphous Replacement methods and other modeling.|date=Oct 1994|publisher=PhD Thesis, Université Joseph Fourier Grenoble I|pages=1–221|url=https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3L_EN9hIuFTTkhuN2lrWEU4RDQ&amp;authuser=0 |doi= 10.13140/2.1.4776.7844}}&lt;/ref&gt; family of proteins, [[tendon]], [[muscle proteins]] like [[actin]], cell proteins like [[microtubule]]s and many others, [[spider silk]], [[sinew]] and [[hair]] etc.

==Human-made fibers{{anchor|Chemical}}==
Human-made or chemical fibers are fibers whose chemical composition, structure, and properties are significantly modified during the manufacturing process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/361113/man-made-fibre |date=2013 |title=man-made fibre |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Man-made fibers consist of regenerated fibers and synthetic fibers.
{{see also|fibre modification}}

===Semi-synthetic fibers===
Semi-synthetic fibers are made from raw materials with naturally long-chain polymer structure and are only modified and partially degraded by chemical processes, in contrast to completely synthetic fibers such as [[nylon]] (polyamide) or [[dacron]] (polyester), which the chemist synthesizes from low-molecular weight compounds by polymerization (chain-building) reactions. The earliest semi-synthetic fiber is the cellulose regenerated fiber, [[rayon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1021/ed070p887|bibcode=1993JChEd..70..887K |title=Rayon: the first semi-synthetic fiber product |date= 1993 |last1= Kauffman |first1= George B. |journal= Journal of Chemical Education|volume= 70 |issue= 11 |pages= 887}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most semi-synthetic fibers are cellulose regenerated fibers.

====Cellulose regenerated fibers{{anchor|Regenerated}}====
[[Cellulose fiber]]s are a subset of man-made fibers, regenerated from natural [[cellulose]]. The cellulose comes from various sources: rayon from tree wood fiber, [[Modal (textile)|Modal]] from beech trees, [[bamboo fiber]] from bamboo, [[seacell]] from [[seaweed]], etc. In the production of these fibers, the cellulose is reduced to a fairly pure form as a viscous mass and formed into fibers by extrusion through spinnerets. Therefore, the manufacturing process leaves few characteristics distinctive of the natural source material in the finished products.

Some examples of this fiber type are:
* [[rayon]]
* [[Bamboo textiles|bamboo fiber]]
* [[Lyocell]], a brand of rayon
* [[Modal (textile)|Modal]], using beech trees as input
* [[Cellulose diacetate|diacetate fiber]]
* [[Cellulose triacetate|triacetate fiber]].

Historically, cellulose diacetate and -triacetate were classified under the term rayon, but are now considered distinct materials.

===Synthetic fibers===
{{Main|Synthetic fiber}}

[[Synthetic fiber|Synthetic]] come entirely from synthetic materials such as [[petrochemical]]s, unlike those man-made fibers derived from such natural substances as cellulose or protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/578682/synthetic-fibre |date=2013 |title=synthetic fibre |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiber classification in reinforced plastics falls into two classes: (i) short fibers, also known as discontinuous fibers, with a general aspect ratio (defined as the ratio of fiber length to diameter) between 20 and 60, and (ii) long fibers, also known as continuous fibers, the general aspect ratio is between 200 and 500.&lt;ref&gt;Serope Kalpakjian, Steven R Schmid. "Manufacturing Engineering and Technology". International edition. 4th Ed. Prentice Hall, Inc. 2001. {{ISBN|0-13-017440-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Metallic fibers====
{{Main|Metallic fiber}}
[[Metallic fiber]]s can be drawn from ductile metals such as copper, gold or silver and extruded or deposited from more brittle ones, such as nickel, aluminum or iron.
See also [[Stainless steel fiber]]s.

====Carbon fiber====
[[Carbon (fiber)|Carbon fibers]] are often based on oxidized and via [[pyrolysis]] carbonized polymers like [[Polyacrylonitrile|PAN]], but the end product is almost pure carbon.

====Silicon carbide fiber====
[[Silicon carbide]] fibers, where the basic polymers are not [[hydrocarbon]]s but polymers, where about 50% of the carbon atoms are replaced by silicon atoms, so-called poly-carbo-[[silane]]s. The pyrolysis yields an amorphous silicon carbide, including mostly other elements like oxygen, titanium, or aluminium, but with mechanical properties very similar to those of carbon fibers.

====Fiberglass====
{{See also|Glass#Fiberglass}}

[[Fiberglass]], made from specific glass, and [[optical fiber]], made from purified natural [[quartz]], are also man-made fibers that come from natural raw materials, [[silica fiber]], made from [[sodium silicate]] (water glass) and [[basalt fiber]] made from melted basalt.

====Mineral fibers====
Mineral fibers can be particularly strong because they are formed with a low number of surface defects, [[asbestos]] is a common one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Edward Gordon|author2=Philip Ball|title=The new science of strong materials, or, Why you don't fall through the floor|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jyCFQgAACAAJ|accessdate=28 October 2011|date=2006|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=978-0-691-12548-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Polymer fibers====
*Polymer fibers are a subset of man-made fibers, which are based on synthetic chemicals (often from [[petrochemical]] sources) rather than arising from natural materials by a purely physical process. These fibers are made from:
** polyamide [[nylon]]
** PET or PBT [[polyester]]
** phenol-formaldehyde (PF)
** polyvinyl chloride fiber (PVC) [[vinyon]]
** polyolefins (PP and PE) [[olefin fiber]]
** [[Acrylic fiber|acrylic]] polyesters, pure [[polyester]] PAN fibers are used to make [[carbon fiber]] by roasting them in a low oxygen environment. Traditional acrylic fiber is used more often as a synthetic replacement for wool. Carbon fibers and PF fibers are noted as two resin-based fibers that are not thermoplastic, most others can be melted.
** [[aramid|aromatic polyamids]] (aramids) such as [[Twaron]], [[Kevlar]] and [[Nomex]] thermally degrade at high temperatures and do not melt. These fibers have strong bonding between polymer chains
** [[polyethylene]] (PE), eventually with extremely long chains / [[Ultra high molecular weight polyethylene|HMPE]] (e.g. Dyneema or Spectra).
** [[Elastomer]]s can even be used, e.g. [[spandex]] although urethane fibers are starting to replace spandex technology.
** [[polyurethane]] fiber
** [[Elastolefin]]
*Coextruded fibers have two distinct polymers forming the fiber, usually as a core-sheath or side-by-side. Coated fibers exist such as nickel-coated to provide static elimination, silver-coated to provide anti-bacterial properties and aluminum-coated to provide RF deflection for [[Chaff (radar countermeasure)|radar chaff]]. Radar chaff is actually a spool of continuous glass tow that has been aluminum coated. An aircraft-mounted high speed cutter chops it up as it spews from a moving aircraft to confuse radar signals.

====Microfibers====
[[Microfiber]]s in [[textiles]] refer to sub-denier fiber (such as [[polyester]] drawn to 0.5 denier). [[Units of textile measurement#Denier|Denier]] and [[Units of textile measurement#Tex|Dtex]] are two measurements of fiber yield based on weight and length. If the fiber density is known, you also have a fiber diameter, otherwise it is simpler to measure diameters in micrometers. Microfibers in technical fibers refer to ultra fine fibers (glass or meltblown [[thermoplastics]]) often used in filtration. Newer fiber designs include extruding fiber that splits into multiple finer fibers. Most synthetic fibers are round in cross-section, but special designs can be hollow, oval, star-shaped or trilobal. The latter design provides more optically reflective properties. Synthetic textile fibers are often crimped to provide bulk in a woven, non woven or knitted structure. Fiber surfaces can also be dull or bright. Dull surfaces reflect more light while bright tends to transmit light and make the fiber more transparent.

Very short and/or irregular fibers have been called fibrils. Natural [[cellulose]], such as [[cotton]] or bleached [[kraft]], show smaller fibrils jutting out and away from the main fiber structure.&lt;ref name=b1&gt;Hans-J. Koslowski.

'''Gembone''' is mineralized bone, often dinosaur bone, which has had the individual cells fossilized with precious minerals. It is one of four gemstones created from organisms (the others being [[Pearl]], [[Ammolite]], and [[Amber]]). Many minerals can be found in Gembone including [[hematite]], [[iron]], [[pyrite]], [[jasper]], [[marcasite]], [[agate]], [[quartz]] or other crystal.&lt;ref name="Dinosaur Gembone Guide on Ebay"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reviews.ebay.com/Dinosaur-Gembone_W0QQugidZ10000000002552086|title=Dinosaur Gembone Guide on Ebay|accessdate=2010-03-24|publisher=Ebay.com|author=M.

'''Hinode''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|iː|n|oʊ|d|eɪ}}; {{lang-ja|ひので}}, {{IPA-ja|çinode|IPA}}, '''Sunrise'''), formerly '''Solar-B''', is a [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] [[Sun|Solar]] mission with [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] collaboration. It is the follow-up to the [[Yohkoh]] (Solar-A) mission and it was launched on the final flight of the [[M-V|M-V-7 rocket]] from [[Uchinoura Space Center]], [[Japan]] on 22 September 2006 at 21:36 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] (23 September, 06:36 [[Japan Standard Time|JST]]).  Initial orbit was perigee height 280&amp;nbsp;km, apogee height 686&amp;nbsp;km, inclination 98.3 degrees. Then the satellite maneuvered to the quasi-circular [[sun-synchronous orbit]] over the day/night [[terminator (solar)|terminator]], which allows near-continuous observation of the Sun. On 28 October 2006, the probe's instruments captured their first images.

The data from Hinode are being downloaded to the [[Norway|Norwegian]], terrestrial [[Svalsat]] station, operated by ''[[Kongsberg Gruppen|Kongsberg]]'' a few kilometres west of [[Longyearbyen]], [[Svalbard]]. From there, data was transmitted by [[Telenor]] through a fibre-optic [[Svalbard Undersea Cable System|network]] to mainland Norway at [[Harstad]], and on to data users in North America, Europe and Japan.

== Mission ==
Hinode was planned as a three-year mission to explore the magnetic fields of the Sun. It consists of a coordinated set of optical, [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV), and [[x-ray]] instruments to investigate the interaction between the Sun's magnetic field and its corona. The result will be an improved understanding of the mechanisms that power the solar atmosphere and drive solar eruptions. The EUV imaging spectrometer ( EIS ) was built by a consortium led by the Mullard Space Science Laboratory ([[MSSL]]) in the [[UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solarb.mssl.ucl.ac.uk/SolarB/Solar-B.jsp |title=MSSL Hinode EIS page}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]], the space agency of the United States, was involved with three science instrument components: the Focal Plane Package (FPP), the X-Ray Telescope (XRT), and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) and shares operations support for science planning and instrument command generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/210019main_NASA_FY09_Budget_Estimates.pdf |title=NASA FY 2009 Budget Request |pages=Sci{{hyphen}}281 |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instruments==
[[File:Hinode Views the 2012 Venus Transit.jpg|thumb|Hinode view of the [[Transit of Venus, 2012|2012 Venus transit]]]]
Hinode carries three main instruments to study the [[Sun]]:
;SOT (Solar Optical Telescope)
:A 0.5 meter Gregorian [[optical telescope]] with an [[angular resolution]] of about 0.2 [[arcsecond]] over the [[field of view]] of about 400 x 400 arcsec. At the SOT [[focal plane]], the Focal Plane Package (FPP) built by the [[Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Laboratory]] in [[Palo Alto, California]] consists of three optical instruments:
:*the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI) which produces images of the solar photosphere and chromosphere in six wide-band interference filters; 
:*the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI) which is a tunable Lyot-type birefringent filter capable of producing magnetogram and dopplergram images of the solar surface; 
:*and the Spectropolarimeter (SP) which produces the most sensitive [[vector magnetograph]] maps of the photosphere to date. 
:The FPP also includes a Correlation Tracker (CT) which locks onto [[solar granulation]] to stabilize the SOT images to a fraction of an [[arcsecond]]. The spatial resolution of the SOT is a factor of 5 improvement over previous space-based solar telescopes (e.g., the MDI instrument on the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]]).

;XRT (X-ray Telescope)
:A modified Wolter I telescope design that uses grazing incidence optics to image the [[solar corona]]'s hottest components (0.5 to 10 Million K) with an angular resolution consistent with 1 arcsec pixels at the CCD. The telescope has an imaging field of view of 34 arcminutes. It is capable of capturing an image of the full sun when pointed at the center of the solar disk. The telescope was designed and built by [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO), which, with the Harvard College Observatory (HCO) form the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). The camera was developed by [[NAOJ]] and [[JAXA]].

;EIS (Extreme-Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer)
:A normal incidence extreme ultraviolet (EUV) [[spectrometer]] that obtains spatially resolved spectra in two wavelength bands: 17.0-21.2 and 24.6-29.2 nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msslxr.mssl.ucl.ac.uk:8080/SolarB/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112164239/http://msslxr.mssl.ucl.ac.uk:8080/SolarB/ |archivedate=2008-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Spatial resolution is around 2 arcsec, and the field of view is up to 560 x 512 arcsec&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The emission lines in the EIS wavelength bands are emitted at temperatures ranging from 50,000 K to 20 million K. EIS is used to identify the physical processes involved in heating the [[solar corona]].

==Satellite details==

===Hot Bird 1===
Hot Bird 1 was launched by [[Ariane 4|Ariane 44LP]] on 28 March 1995.  The 13° east slot predates the launch, with [[Eutelsat 1F1]] having been located there as early as 1983, and [[Eutelsat 2F1]] having also served time at the location. It has reached end-of-life.

===Hot Bird 3===
Hot Bird 3 was launched by [[Ariane 4|Ariane 44LP]] on 2 September 1997 and intended to be moved to 10°E to become [[Eurobird 10]]. During the drift from 13°E to 10°E, the satellite suffered loss of power from one solar array. It was nevertheless successfully moved to 10°E, but could only operate at a reduced capacity. Since then, it is operating at 4°E under the name Eurobird 4. At last it was moved to 75°E and renamed to ABS_1B. It has reached end-of-life.

===Hot Bird 4===
Hot Bird 4 was launched by [[Ariane 4|Ariane 42P]] on 27 February 1998 and redeployed to 7°W in July 2006, becoming [[Atlantic Bird]] 4 / [[Nilesat 103]]

===Hot Bird 5===
Hot Bird 5 was launched by [[Atlas II|Atlas-2A]] on 9 October 1998 and re-located to 25.5°E and renamed [[Eurobird 2]]. Six transponders are leased to [[Arabsat]] under the name [[Badr 2]], after having been called [[Arabsat 2D]].

===Hot Bird 6 (Hot Bird 70D)===
Hot Bird 6 was launched by [[Atlas V|Atlas V 401]] on 21 July 2002. Starting on 12 June 2009, the [[2009 Iranian election protests|day of Iranian elections]], deliberate interference affecting this satellite was traced to [[Iran]]. Hot Bird 6 is the primary carrier for [[BBC Persian Television]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/19/persian.shtml BBC Persian television combats broadcast interference from Iran], BBC Press Release&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, it is replaced with Hot Bird 10 (Hot Bird 13D)

===Hot Bird 7/7A===
Hot Bird 7 was lost in December 2002 during the [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5 ECA]] launch. Its replacement, [[Hot Bird 7A]] (a [[Spacebus]] 3000B3) was successfully launched on 11 March 2006.

===Hot Bird 8 (Hot Bird 13B)===
Hot Bird 8 was launched by [[Proton (rocket)|Proton]] on 5 August 2006. With a launch mass of 4.9 tonnes, Hot Bird 8 is the largest and the most powerful broadcast satellite serving [[Europe]].

===Hot Bird 9 (Hot Bird 13C)===
Hot Bird 9 was launched by [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5 ECA]] in December 2008. Its entry into service enabled the Hot Bird 7A satellite to be redeployed to 9° East and rebranded Eurobird 9A, increasing capacity to 38 {{Ku band}} [[transponders]] at this orbital position.

===Hot Bird 10 (Eutelsat 33E)===
Hot Bird 10 was launched by [[Ariane 5|Ariane 5 ECA]] in February 2009 with [[NSS-9]], [[Spirale]] A and Spirale B.  The Eutelat 33E satellite is located at 33° East, Eutelsat’s premium video neighbourhood for cable and satellite broadcasting in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.

[[Image:Hot lahar at Santiaguito.jpg|thumb|A lahar travels down a river valley in Guatemala near the [[Santa María (volcano)|Santa Maria volcano]], 1989.]]

A '''lahar''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|ˈ|l|ɑː|h|ɑr}}, from {{lang-jv|ꦮ꧀ꦭꦲꦂ|wlahar}}) is a violent type of [[mudflow]] or [[debris flow]] composed of a [[slurry]] of [[pyroclastic]] material, rocky debris and [[water]]. The material flows down from a [[volcano]], typically along a [[river]] [[valley]].&lt;ref name="usgsgloss"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/images/pglossary/lahar.php|title=Lahar|work=USGS Photo Glossary|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lahars are extremely destructive: they can flow tens of metres per second (22&amp;nbsp;mph or more), they have been known to be up to {{convert|140|m|ft}} deep, and large flows tend to destroy any structures in their path. They have even been known to decimate entire settlements. Notable lahars include those at [[Mount Pinatubo]] and [[Armero tragedy|Nevado del Ruiz]], the latter of which killed thousands of people and caused extensive damage to infrastructure.

==Etymology==
[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|right|Excavated 9th century [[Sambisari]] Hindu temple near [[Yogyakarta]] in Java, Indonesia, was buried 6.5 metres under the ''lahar'' vulcanic debris accumulated from centuries of [[Mount Merapi]] eruptions]]
The word ''lahar'' is of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title =Encyclopedia of Volcanoes |chapter= Chapter 37 – Lahars and Their Deposits|chapter-url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123859389000377|publisher = Academic Press|date = 2015-01-01|location = Amsterdam|isbn = 978-0-12-385938-9|pages = 649–664|first = James W.|last = Vallance|first2 = Richard M.|last2 = Iverson|editor-first = Haraldur|editor-last = Sigurdsson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geological term was introduced by [[Berend George Escher]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Goudie, Andrew|title=Encyclopedia of Geomorphology|volume=vol. 2|year=2004|chapter=''Lahar'' by Vincent E. Neall|pages=597–599|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UHRU_6nUSR4C&amp;pg=PA597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A lahar is a volcanic [[mudflow]] or debris flow.&lt;ref name=Java&gt;{{cite book|title=Mountain Environments: An Examination of the Physical Geography of Mountains|first=John|last=Gerrard|year=1990|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0262071284|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lahars have the consistency, viscosity and approximate density of wet [[concrete]]: fluid when moving, solid at rest.&lt;ref name="usgswhat"/&gt; Lahars can be huge. The [[Osceola Lahar]] produced by [[Mount Rainier]] ([[Washington (state)|Washington]]) some 5600 years ago resulted in a wall of mud {{Convert|140|m|ft|-1}} deep in the [[White River (Washington)|White River]] canyon, which covered an area of over {{Convert|330|km2|sqmi|-1}}, for a total volume of {{Convert|2.3|km3|mi3|2}}.&lt;ref name="Crandall"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crandell|first=D.R.|authorlink=Dwight Crandell|year=1971|title=Post glacial lahars From Mount Rainier Volcano, Washington |journal=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper|volume=677|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lahar of sufficient size and intensity can erase virtually any structure in its path, and is capable of carving its own pathway, making the prediction of its course difficult. Conversely, a lahar quickly loses force when it leaves the channel of its flow: even frail huts may remain standing, while at the same time being buried to the roof line in mud. A lahar's viscosity decreases with time, and can be further thinned by rain, but it nevertheless solidifies quickly when coming to a stop.

Lahars vary in size and speed. Small lahars less than a few metres wide and several centimetres deep may flow a few metres per second. Large lahars hundreds of meters wide and tens of meters deep can flow several tens of metres per second (22&amp;nbsp;mph or more): much too fast for people to outrun.&lt;ref name="usgswhat"&gt;{{USGS|article=Lahars and Their Effects|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/lahar/index.php|accessdate=2012-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the potential to flow at speeds up to {{Convert|100|km/h|mph|-1}}, and flow distances of more than {{Convert|300|km|mi|-1}}, a lahar can cause catastrophic destruction in its path.&lt;ref name="hoblitt"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://vulcan.wr.usgs.gov/Hazards/NRC_Report/nrc_hazards.html|title=Volcanic Hazards with Regard to Siting Nuclear-Power Plants in the Pacific Northwest|last=Hoblitt|first=R.P.|author2=Miller, C.D. |author3=Scott, W.E. |journal=U.S. Geological Survey Open-File Report|volume=87–297|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lahars from the 1985 [[Nevado del Ruiz]] eruption in [[Colombia]] caused the [[Armero tragedy]], which killed an estimated 23,000 people, when the city of [[Armero]] was buried under {{Convert|5|m|ft|0}} of mud and debris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/Lahars/RuizLahars.html |title=Deadly Lahars from Nevado del Ruiz, Colombia |work=USGS Volcano Hazards Program |accessdate=2007-09-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824150301/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Hazards/What/Lahars/RuizLahars.html |archivedate=2007-08-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A lahar caused New Zealand's [[Tangiwai disaster]],&lt;ref name="Tangiwai1"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/documents/about-doc/concessions-and-permits/conservation-revealed/lahars-from-mt-ruapehu-lowres.pdf | title=Lahars from Mt Ruapehu | publisher=[[Department of Conservation (New Zealand)]] | date=2006 | accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; where 151 people died after a Christmas Eve express train fell into the [[Whangaehu River]] in 1953. Lahars have been responsible for 17% of volcano-related deaths between 1783 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanguy|first=J.|year=1998|title=Victims from volcanic eruptions: a revised database|journal=Bulletin of Volcanology|volume=60|issue=2|page=140|doi=10.1007/s004450050222|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A lahar can cause fatalities years after its precipitating eruption. For example, the [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Cabalantian tragedy]] occurred four years subsequent to the 1991 eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]].

==Causes==
[[File:MSH80 mudline muddy river with USGS scientist 10-23-80.jpg|thumb|This [[mudline]] left behind on the trees on the banks of the [[Muddy River (Washington)|Muddy River]] after the [[1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens]] shows how high the lahar floods reached here.]]
Lahars have several possible causes:&lt;ref name="usgswhat"/&gt;
* [[Snow]] and [[glacier]]s can be melted by lava and/or [[pyroclastic surge]]s during an eruption.
* Lava gushes out of open vents and can mix with wet soil, mud and/or snow on the slope of the volcano making a very viscous, high energy lahar. (The higher up the slope of the volcano, the more gravitational potential energy the flows will have.)
* A [[flood]] caused by a glacier, [[lake breakout]], or heavy rainfalls can generate lahars, also called [[glacier run]] or [[jökulhlaup]]
* Water from a [[crater lake]], combined with volcanic elements in an eruption.
* Heavy rainfall on unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits.
* Volcanic landslides with water.
In particular, although lahars are typically associated with the effects of volcanic activity, lahars can occur even without any current volcanic activity, as long as the conditions are right to cause the collapse and movement of mud originating from existing [[volcanic ash]] deposits.
* Snow and glaciers can melt during periods of mild to hot weather.
* [[Earthquakes]] underneath or close to the volcano can shake material loose and cause it to collapse, triggering a lahar avalanche.
* [[Rainfall]] can cause the still-hanging slabs of solidified mud to come rushing down the slopes at a speed of more than {{convert|30|km/h|mph|-1}}, causing devastating results.

Several mountains in the world, including [[Mount Rainier]] in the United States, [[Mount Ruapehu]] in New Zealand, [[Mount Merapi|Merapi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/05/lahar-destroys-farmlands.html|title=Lahar destroys farmlands|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2011/02/24/2040513/material.lahar.dingin.masih.berbahaya|title=Material Lahar Dingin Masih Berbahaya - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2011-02-24|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-06-06|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galunggung]] in Indonesia, are considered particularly dangerous due to the risk of lahars. Several towns in the [[Puyallup River]] valley in Washington state, including [[Orting, Washington|Orting]], are built on top of lahar deposits that are only about 500 years old. Lahars are predicted to flow through the valley every 500 to 1,000 years, so Orting, [[Sumner, Washington|Sumner]], [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]], [[Fife, Washington|Fife]], and the Port of [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] face considerable risk.
The [[United States Geological Survey|USGS]] has set up [[Mount Rainier Volcano Lahar Warning System|lahar warning sirens]] in [[Pierce County, Washington]], so that people can flee an approaching debris flow in the event of a Mount Rainier eruption.

A lahar [[warning system]] has been set up at [[Mount Ruapehu]] by the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation]] and hailed as a success after it successfully alerted officials to an impending lahar on 18 March 2007.

Since mid-June 1991, when violent eruptions triggered [[Mount Pinatubo]]'s first lahars in 500 years, a system to monitor and warn of lahars has been in operation. Radio-telemetered rain gauges provide data on rainfall in lahar source regions, acoustic flow monitors on stream banks detect ground vibration as lahars pass, and manned watchpoints further confirm that lahars are rushing down Pinatubo's slopes. This system has enabled warnings to be sounded for most but not all major lahars at Pinatubo, saving hundreds of lives.&lt;ref name=pinatuboLahar&gt;{{USGS|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/1997/fs114-97/|author=Chris Newhall, Peter H. Stauffer, and James W. Hendley II|article=Lahars of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physical preventative measures by the [[Philippine government]] were not adequate to stop over {{convert|20|ft|m}} of mud from flooding many villages around Mount Pinatubo from 1992 through 1998.

Scientists and governments try to identify areas with a high risk of lahars based on historical events and computer models. Volcano scientists play a critical role in effective hazard education by informing officials and the public about realistic hazard probabilities and scenarios (including potential magnitude, timing, and impacts); by helping evaluate the effectiveness of proposed risk-reduction strategies; by helping promote acceptance of (and confidence in) hazards information through participatory engagement with officials and vulnerable communities as partners in risk reduction efforts; and by communicating with emergency managers during extreme events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pierson |first=Thomas C |last2=Wood |first2=Nathan J |last3=Driedger |first3=Carolyn L |date=2014-11-06 |title=Reducing risk from lahar hazards: concepts, case studies, and roles for scientists |journal=Journal of Applied Volcanology |language=en |volume=3 |issue=1 |doi=10.1186/s13617-014-0016-4 |issn=2191-5040}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a model is [[TITAN2D]]. These models are directed towards future planning: identifying low-risk regions to place community buildings, discovering how to mitigate lahars with dams, and constructing evacuation plans.

==Examples==

===Nevado del Ruiz===
{{main|Armero tragedy}}
[[Image:Armero aftermath Marso.jpg|thumb|The lahar from the 1985 eruption of [[Nevado del Ruiz]] that [[Armero tragedy|wiped out the town of Armero]] in [[Colombia]].]]

In 1985, the volcano [[Nevado del Ruiz]] erupted in central Colombia. As [[pyroclastic flows]] erupted from the [[volcanic crater|volcano's crater]], they melted the mountain's glaciers, sending four enormous lahars down its slopes at {{convert|60|km/h|mph|-1|sp=us|abbr=off}}. The lahars picked up speed in [[gully|gullies]] and coursed into the six major rivers at the base of the volcano; they engulfed the [[Armero|town of Armero]], killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000&amp;nbsp;inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schuster|first1=Robert L.|last2=Highland|first2=Lynn M.|year=2001|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2001/ofr-01-0276/|title=Socioeconomic and Environmental Impacts of Landslides in the Western Hemisphere|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|id=Open-File Report 01-0276|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Casualties in other towns, particularly [[Chinchiná]], brought the overall death toll to 23,000. Footage and photographs of [[Omayra Sánchez]], a young victim of the [[Tragedy (event)|tragedy]], were published around the world. Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster.

===Mount Pinatubo===
{{main|1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo}}
[[File:River valley filled in by pyroclastic flows, Mt. Pinatubo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A before-and-after photograph of a river valley filled in by lahars from Mount Pinatubo.]]

The 1991 [[eruption]] of [[Mount Pinatubo]] caused lahar flows: the first eruption itself killed six people, but the lahar flows killed more than 1500. The eye of [[Typhoon Yunya (Diding)|Typhoon Yunya]] passed over the volcano during its eruption on June 15, 1991. The rain from the typhoon triggered the flow of [[volcanic ash]], boulders, and water down the [[rivers]] surrounding the [[volcano]]. In [[Pampanga]], [[Angeles City]] and neighbouring cities and towns were damaged by the volcano's sticky lahar floods when Sapang Balen Creek and the Abacan River became the channels for the mudflows and carried it to the heart of the city and surrounding areas.

Over {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip}} of mud inundated and damaged the towns of [[Castillejos, Zambales|Castillejos]], [[San Marcelino, Zambales|San Marcelino]] and [[Botolan, Zambales|Botolan]] in [[Zambales]], [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]] and [[Mabalacat, Pampanga|Mabalacat City]] in [[Pampanga]], [[Tarlac City, Tarlac|Tarlac City]], [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]] and [[Bamban, Tarlac|Bamban]] in [[Tarlac]]. The lahar floods down the Sacobia-Bamban River scoured all structures in its path, including the bridges and dikes by the Parua River in [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]]. The [[Tarlac River]] in [[Tarlac City]] was inundated by over {{convert|20|ft|m|0|order=flip}} of lahar, causing the river to lose the ability to hold water.

On the morning of October 1, 1995, pyroclastic material which clung to the slopes of Pinatubo and surrounding mountains rushed down because of heavy rain, and turned into an {{convert|25|ft|m|0|adj=on|order=flip}} lahar flood. These mudflows killed hundreds of people in Barangay Cabalantian in [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]]. The Philippine government under President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] ordered the construction of the FVR Mega Dike in an attempt to protect people from further mudflows.

Another typhoon-volcano lahar hit the Philippines in 2006; see [[Typhoon Reming]].

The '''Leopold matrix''' is a qualitative [[environmental impact assessment]] method pioneered in 1971.&lt;ref name="Leopold"&gt;
{{cite book |title=A Procedure for Evaluating Environmental Impact |last1=Leopold |first1=Luna B. |last2=Clarke |first2=Frank E. |last3=Hanshaw |first3=Bruce B. |last4=Balsley |first4=James R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |series=Geological Survey Circular 645 |year=1971 |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |location=Washington |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/cir645 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to identify the potential impact of a [[Project#Engineering project|project]] on the [[natural environment|environment]]. The system consists of a matrix with columns representing the various activities of the project, and rows representing the various environmental factors to be considered. The intersections are filled in to indicate the magnitude (from -10 to +10) and the importance (from 1 to 10) of the impact of each activity on each environmental factor.

Measurements of magnitude and importance tend to be related, but do not necessarily directly correlate. Magnitude can be measured, in terms of how much area is affected by the [[land development|development]] and how badly, but importance is a more subjective measurement. While a proposed development may have a large impact in terms of magnitude, the effects it causes may not actually significantly affect the environment as a whole. The example given by Leopold is of a [[stream]] that significantly alters the [[Erosion#Water|erosion]] patterns in a specific area, which will have a significant magnitude, but may not be important, provided the stream in question is swift moving and transports large amounts of [[soil]] anyway. In this case, an impact of significant magnitude may not actually be important to the environment in question.&lt;ref name="Leopold" /&gt;{{rp|5}}

'''Mare Spumans''' (from [[Latin]]: ''foaming sea'') is a [[lunar mare]] located just south of [[Mare Undarum]] on the lunar near side.  It is one of the many elevated lakes contained in the Crisium basin, surrounding [[Mare Crisium]].  The surrounding basin material is of the [[Nectarian]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]], while the mare [[basalt]] being of the [[Upper Imbrian]] epoch. The [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Petit (crater)|Petit]] (formerly {{nobr|Apollonius W}}) is located on the western rim of the mare. This crater is white and surrounded by a well-defined [[ray system]].

A '''meander''' is one of a series of regular sinuous curves, bends, loops, turns, or windings in the channel of a river, stream, or other watercourse. It is produced by a stream or river swinging from side to side as it flows across its floodplain or shifts its channel within a valley. A meander is produced  by a stream or river as it [[erosion|erodes]] the [[sediment]]s comprising an outer, concave bank ([[cut bank]]) and deposits this and other sediment downstream on an inner, convex bank which is typically a [[point bar]].  The result of sediments being eroded from the outside concave bank and their deposition on an inside convex bank is the formation of a [[sinuous]] course as a channel migrates back and forth across the down-valley axis of a floodplain. The zone within which a meandering stream shifts its channel across either its floodplain or valley floor from time to time is known as a '''meander belt'''. It typically ranges from 15 to 18 times the width of the channel. Over time, meanders migrate downstream, sometimes in such a short time as to create civil engineering problems for local municipalities attempting to maintain stable roads and bridges.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"&gt;Neuendorf, K.K.E., J.P.

The degree of meandering of the channel of a river, stream, or other watercourse is measured by its '''sinuosity'''. The sinuosity of a watercourse is the ratio of the length of the channel to the straight line down-valley distance. Streams or rivers with a single channel and sinuosities of 1.5 or more are defined as '''meandering''' streams or rivers.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeopoldOthers1957a"&gt;Leopold, L.B., Wolman, M.G., Wolman, M.G. and Wolman, M.G., 1957.

==Origin of term==
The term derives from the [[Büyük Menderes River|Meander River]] located in present-day Turkey and known to the [[Ancient Greeks]] as Μαίανδρος ''Maiandros'' ([[Latin]]: ''Maeander''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meander|title=Meander|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; characterised by a very convoluted path along the lower reach. As a result, even in [[Classical Greece]] (and in later Greek thought) the name of the river had become a common noun meaning anything convoluted and winding, such as decorative patterns or speech and ideas, as well as the [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=meander&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title= Meander|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Strabo]] said: ‘…its course is so exceedingly winding that everything winding is called meandering.’&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]], ''Geography'', Book 12 Chapter 8 Section 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meander River is located south of Izmir, east of the ancient Greek town of [[Miletus]], now Milet, Turkey. It flows through a [[graben]] in the Menderes Massif, but has a flood plain much wider than the meander zone in its lower reach. Its modern Turkish name is the [[Büyük Menderes River]].

==Governing physics==
[[File:Bend2.png|thumb|Straight channel culminating in a single bend]]

When a fluid is introduced to an initially straight channel which then bends, the sidewalls induce a pressure gradient that causes the fluid to alter course and follow the bend.  From here, two opposing processes occur:  (1) irrotational flow and (2) secondary flow.  For a river to ‘meander’, secondary flow must dominate.

'''Irrotational flow''':  From Bernoulli's equations, high pressure results in low velocity.  Therefore, ''in the absence of secondary flow'' we would expect low fluid velocity at the outside bend and high fluid velocity at the inside bend.  This classic fluid mechanics result is ''irrotational vortex flow.''  In the context of meandering rivers, its effects are dominated by those of secondary flow.

'''Secondary flow''':  A force balance exists between pressure forces pointing to the inside bend of the river and centrifugal forces pointing to the outside bend of the river.  In the context of meandering rivers, a [[boundary layer]] exists within the thin layer of fluid that interacts with the river bed.  Inside that layer and following standard boundary-layer theory, the velocity of the fluid is effectively zero.  Centrifugal force, which depends on velocity, is also therefore effectively zero.  Pressure force, however, remains unaffected by the boundary layer.  Therefore, within the boundary layer, pressure force dominates and fluid moves along the bottom of the river from the outside bend to the inside bend.  This initiates helicoidal flow:  Along the river bed, fluid roughly follows the curve of the channel but is also forced toward the inside bend; away from the river bed, fluid also roughly follows the curve of the channel but is forced, to some extent, from the inside to the outside bend.  Ultimately, the downstream velocity of the fluid is convectively transported to the outside bend, resulting in higher velocities at the outside bend. This secondary flow effect dominates over that of irrotational flow:  In real meandering rivers, we observe higher downstream fluid velocities at the outside bends.

The higher (lower) velocities at the outside (inside) bend result in higher (lower) shear stresses and therefore results in erosion (deposition).  Thus meander bends erode at the outside bend, causing the river to becoming increasingly sinuous (until cutoff events occur).  Deposition at the inside bend occur such that for most natural meandering rivers, the river width remains nearly constant, even as the river evolves.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Samantha Freeman. (April 2016).

==Meander geometry==
[[File:Meandri uvca.jpg|thumb|[[Uvac]] canyon meander, [[Serbia]]]]
[[File:The Carstairs meanders from the air (geograph 5676421).jpg|thumb|right|meanders on the [[River Clyde]], [[Scotland]]]]
The technical description of a meandering watercourse is termed meander [[geometry]] or meander [[Plans (drawings)|planform]] geometry.&lt;ref&gt;The technical definitions of this section rely heavily on {{cite book|first=Pierre Y.|last=Julien|title=River Mechanics|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University press|isbn=0-521-52970-0|pages=179–184}} In addition concepts are utilized from {{cite book|first=Walter|last=Graf|title=Hydraulics of Sediment Transport|publisher=Water Resources Publications|year=1984|isbn=0-918334-56-X|pages=261–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized as an irregular [[waveform]]. Ideal waveforms, such as a [[sine wave]], are one line thick, but in the case of a stream the width must be taken into consideration. The bankfull width is the distance across the bed at an average [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] at the full-stream level, typically estimated by the line of lowest vegetation.

As a waveform the meandering stream follows the down-valley axis, a straight line [[Curve fitting|fitted]] to the curve such that the sum of all the amplitudes measured from it is zero. This axis represents the overall direction of the stream.

At any cross-section the flow is following the sinuous axis, the centerline of the bed. Two consecutive crossing points of sinuous and down-valley axes 
define a meander loop. The meander is two consecutive loops pointing in opposite transverse directions. The distance of one meander along the down-valley axis 
is the meander length or [[wavelength]]. The maximum distance from the down-valley axis to the sinuous axis of a loop is the meander width or [[amplitude]]. The course at that point is the apex.

In contrast to sine waves, the loops of a meandering stream are more nearly circular. The [[curvature]] varies from a maximum at the apex to zero at a crossing point (straight line), also called an inflection, because the curvature changes direction in that vicinity. The [[radius]] of the loop is the straight line [[perpendicular]] to the down-valley axis intersecting the sinuous axis at the apex. As the loop is not ideal, additional information is needed to characterize it. The orientation angle is the angle between sinuous axis and down-valley axis at any point on the sinuous axis.

[[File:Great Ouse Relief Channel.jpg|thumb|left|Concave bank and convex bank, [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse Relief Channel]], England.]]
A loop at the apex has an outer or [[wikt:concav|concave]] bank and an inner or [[wiktionary:Convex|convex]] bank. The meander belt is defined by an average meander width measured from outer bank to outer bank instead of from centerline to centerline. If there is a [[flood plain]], it extends beyond the meander belt. The meander is then said to be free—it can be found anywhere in the flood plain. If there is no flood plain, the meanders are fixed.

Various mathematical formulae relate the variables of the meander geometry. As it turns out some numerical parameters can be established, which appear in the formulae. The waveform depends ultimately on the characteristics of the flow but the parameters are independent of it and apparently are caused by geologic factors. In general the meander length is 10–14 times, with an average 11 times, the fullbank channel width and 3 to 5 times, with an average of 4.7 times, the [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] at the apex. This radius is 2–3 times the channel width.

[[File:Meander-Cuckmere River-MT.JPG|thumb|Meander of the River [[Cuckmere]] in Southern [[England]]]]

A meander has a depth pattern as well. The cross-overs are marked by [[riffle]]s, or shallow beds, while at the apices are pools. In a pool direction of flow is downward, scouring the bed material. The major volume, however, flows more slowly on the inside of the bend where, due to decreased velocity, it deposits sediment.

The line of maximum depth, or channel, is the [[thalweg]] or thalweg line. It is typically designated the borderline when rivers are used as political borders. The thalweg hugs the outer banks and returns to center over the riffles. The meander [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] length is the distance along the thalweg over one meander. The river length is the length along the centerline.

==Formation==
[[File:Meander Oxbow development.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|Life history of a meander]]
Meander formation is a result of natural factors and processes. The waveform configuration of a stream is constantly changing. Fluid flows around a bend in a [[vortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jacques | last=Lewalle | title=Lecture Notes in Incompressible Fluid Dynamics: Phenomenology, Concepts and Analytical Tools | chapter=Flow Separation and Secondary Flow: Section 9.1 | url=http://www.ecs.syr.edu/faculty/lewalle/FluidDynamics/fluidsCh9.pdf | year=2006 | location=Syracuse, NY | publisher=Syracuse University}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Once a channel begins to follow a sinusoidal path, the amplitude and concavity of the loops increase dramatically due to the effect of [[helical flow]] sweeping dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend, and leaving the outside of the bend unprotected and therefore vulnerable to accelerated erosion, forming a [[positive feedback loop]]. In the words of Elizabeth A. Wood:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Elizabeth A.|last=Wood|title=Science from Your Airplane Window: 2nd Revised Edition|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=1975|location=New York|isbn=0-486-23205-0|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;‘…this process of making meanders seems to be a self-intensifying process…in which greater curvature results in more erosion of the bank, which results in greater curvature…’&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cross-current along the floor of the channel is part of the [[Secondary flow#River bends|secondary flow]] and sweeps dense eroded material towards the inside of the bend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hickin|2003|p=432}}. One of the important consequences of helical flow in meanders is that sediment eroded from the outside of a meander bend tends to move to the inner bank or point bar of the next downstream bend.&lt;/ref&gt; The cross-current then rises to the surface near the inside and flows towards the outside, forming the  [[helical flow]]. The greater the curvature of the bend, and the faster the flow, the stronger is the cross-current and the sweeping.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hickin|2003|p=434}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the conservation of [[angular momentum]] the speed on the inside of the bend is faster than on the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hickin|2003|p=432}}. "In the absence of secondary flow, bend flow seeks to conserve angular momentum so that it tends to conform to that of a free vortex with high velocity at the smaller radius of the inner bank and lower velocity at the outer bank where radial acceleration is lower."&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the flow velocity is diminished, so is the centrifugal pressure. However, the pressure of the super-elevated column prevails, developing an unbalanced gradient that moves water back across the bottom from the outside to the inside. The flow is supplied by a counter-flow across the surface from the inside to the outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hickin|2003|p=432}}. "Near the bed, where velocity and thus the centrifugal effects are lowest, the balance of forces is dominated by the inward hydraulic gradient of the super-elevated water surface and secondary flow moves toward the inner bank."&lt;/ref&gt; This entire situation is very similar to the [[Tea leaf paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowker|first=Kent A.|date=1988|title=Albert Einstein and Meandering Rivers|journal=Earth Science History|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.searchanddiscovery.net/documents/Einstein/albert.htm|accessdate=2016-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secondary flow carries sediment from the outside of the bend to the inside making the river more meandering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Callander | first1 = R.A. | year = 1978 | title = River Meandering | url = | journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 129–58 | doi=10.1146/annurev.fl.10.010178.001021| bibcode = 1978AnRFM..10..129C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As to why streams of any size become sinuous in the first place, there are a number of theories, not necessarily mutually exclusive.

===Stochastic theory===
[[File:Rio Negro meanders.JPG|thumb|[[Meander scar]]s, [[oxbow lake]]s and abandoned meanders in the broad  [[flood plain]] of the [[Río Negro (Argentina)|Rio Negro]], [[Argentina]]. 2010 astronaut photo from [[ISS]].]]
The [[stochastic]] theory can take many forms but one of the most general statements is that of Scheidegger: ‘The meander train is assumed to be the result of the stochastic fluctuations of the direction of flow due to the random presence of direction-changing obstacles in the river path.’&lt;ref name=schei113&gt;{{cite book|first=Adrien E.|last=Scheidegger|title=Morphotectonics|publisher=Springer|year=2004|location=Berlin, New York|isbn=3-540-20017-7|page=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Given a flat, smooth, tilted artificial surface, rainfall runs off it in sheets, but even in that case [[adhesion]] of water to the surface and [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesion]] of drops produce rivulets at random. Natural surfaces are rough and erodible to different degrees. The result of all the physical factors acting at random is channels that are not straight, which then progressively become sinuous. Even channels that appear straight have a sinuous [[thalweg]] that leads eventually to a sinuous channel.

===Equilibrium theory===
In the equilibrium theory, meanders decrease the stream [[Grade (slope)|gradient]] until an equilibrium between the [[erodibility]] of the terrain and the transport capacity of the stream is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ann L.|last=Riley|title=Restoring Streams in Cities: A Guide for Planners, Policymakers and Citizens|publisher=Island Press|isbn=1-55963-042-6|year=1998|location=Washington DC|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mass of water descending must give up [[potential energy#Gravitational potential energy|potential energy]], which, given the same velocity at the end of the drop as at the beginning, is removed by interaction with the material of the stream bed. The shortest distance; that is, a straight channel, results in the highest energy per unit of length, disrupting the banks more, creating more sediment and aggrading the stream. The presence of meanders allows the stream to adjust the length to an equilibrium energy per unit length in which the stream carries away all the sediment that it produces.

===Geomorphic and morphotectonic theory===
Geomorphic refers to the surface structure of the terrain. Morphotectonic means having to do with the deeper, or tectonic (plate) structure of the rock. The features included under these categories are not random and guide streams into non-random paths. They are predictable obstacles that instigate meander formation by deflecting the stream. For example, the stream might be guided into a fault line (morphotectonic).

==Associated landforms==
=== Cut bank ===
{{main|Cut bank}}
A '''[[cut bank]]''' is an often vertical bank or cliff that forms where the outside, concave bank of a meander cuts into the floodplain or valley wall of a river or stream. A cutbank is also known either as a '''river-cut cliff''', '''river cliff''', or a '''bluff''' and spelled as '''cutbank'''.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt; Erosion that forms a cut bank occurs at the outside bank of a meander because helicoidal flow of water keeps the bank washed clean of loose sand, silt, and sediment and subjects it to constant erosion. As a result, the meander erodes and migrates in the direction of the outside bend, forming the cut bank.&lt;ref name="ReineckOthers2012a"&gt;

As the cut bank is undermined by erosion, it commonly collapses as slumps into the river channel. The slumped sediment, having been broken up by slumping, is readily eroded and carried toward the middle of the channel. The sediment eroded from a cut bank tends to be deposited on the point bar of the next downstream meander, and not on the point bar opposite it.&lt;ref name="Fisk1944a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReineckOthers2012a"/&gt; This can be seen in areas where trees grow on the banks of rivers; on the inside of meanders, trees, such as willows, are often far from the bank, whilst on the outside of the bend, the tree roots are often exposed and undercut, eventually leading the trees to fall into the river.&lt;ref name="Fisk1944a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fisk1948a"&gt;Fisk, H.N., 1948.

=== Meander cutoff ===
{{Main|Meander cutoff}}
[[File:Rincon Lake Powell.jpg|thumb|The Rincon on [[Lake Powell]] in southern [[Utah]]. It is an incised cutoff (abandoned) meander.]]
A '''[[meander cutoff]]''', also known as either a '''cutoff meander''' or '''abandoned meander''', is a meander that has been abandoned by its stream after the formation of a neck cutoff. A lake that occupies a cutoff meander is known as an ''[[oxbow lake]]''. Cutoff meanders that have cut downward into the underlying bedrock are known in general as '''incised cutoff meanders'''.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt; As in the case of the Anderson Bottom Rincon, incised meanders that have either steep-sided, often vertical walls, are often, but not always, known as '''rincons''' in the [[southwest United States]].&lt;ref name="ShoemakerOthers1975a"&gt;Shoemaker, E.M. and Stephens, H.G., 1975.

=== Incised meanders ===
{{Main|Entrenched river}}
[[File:Glen Canyon Dam MC.jpg|thumb|[[Glen Canyon]], US]]
The meanders of a stream or river that has cut its bed down into the [[bedrock]] are known as either '''incised''', '''intrenched''', '''entrenched''', '''inclosed''' or '''ingrown meanders'''. Some Earth scientists recognize and use a finer subdivision of incised meanders. Thornbury&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"&gt;Thornbury, W. D., 1954, ''Principles of Geomorphology,'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, New York. 618 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; argues that ''incised'' or ''inclosed meanders'' are synonyms that are appropriate to describe any meander incised downward into bedrock and defines ''enclosed'' or ''entrenched meanders'' as a subtype of incised meanders (inclosed meanders) characterized by a symmetrical valley sides. He argues that the symmetrical valley sides are the direct result of rapid down-cutting of a watercourse into bedrock.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"&gt;Fairbridge, R.W. 1968, ''Incised meander.'' In Fairbridge, R.W., ed., pp 548–550, ''The Encyclopedia of Geomorphology.'' Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series, Vol. 3. McGraw-Hill Company, Inc., New York, New York, 1295 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as proposed by Rich,&lt;ref name="Rich1914a"&gt;Rich, J.L., 1914. ''Certain types of stream valleys and their meaning.'' ''The Journal of Geology'', 22(5), pp. 469–497.&lt;/ref&gt; Thornbury argues that incised valleys with a pronounced asymmetry of cross section, which he called ''ingrown meanders'', are the result of the [[River channel migration|lateral migration]] and [[River incision|incision]] of a meander during a period of slower channel [[downcutting]]. Regardless, the formation of both entrenched meanders and ingrown meanders is thought to require that [[base level]] falls as a result of either relative change in mean [[sea level]], [[Post-glacial rebound|isostatic]] or [[Tectonics|tectonic]] uplift, the breach of an ice or [[landslide]] dam, or regional tilting. Classic examples of incised meanders are associated with rivers in the [[Colorado Plateau]], the [[Kentucky River Palisades]] in central [[Kentucky]], and streams in the [[Ozark Plateau]].&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbour2008a"&gt;Barbour, J.R., 2008. ''The origin and significance of sinuosity along incising bedrock rivers.'' Doctoral dissertation, Columbia University, New York, New York, 172 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goosenecks of the San Juan, Utah.jpg|thumb|Goosenecks of the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]], SE [[Utah]]. Note cut-off meander at right center.]]As noted above, it was initially either argued or presumed that an incised meander is characteristic of an [[Antecedent drainage stream|antecedent stream or river]] that had incised its channel into underlying [[strata]]. An antecedent stream or river is one that maintains its original course and pattern during incision despite the changes in underlying rock topography and rock types.&lt;ref name="Thornbury1954a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"/&gt; However, later geologists&lt;ref name="HackOther1959a"&gt;Hack, J.T., and Young, R.S., 1959. ''Intrenched meanders of the North Fork of the Shenandoah River, Virginia.'' ''United States Geological Survey Professional Paper'' 354-A, 10 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the shape of an incised meander is not always, if ever, "inherited," e.g., strictly from an antecedent meandering stream where it  meander pattern could freely develop on a level floodplain. Instead, they argue that as fluvial incision of bedrock proceeds, the stream course is significantly modified by variations in rock type and [[Fracture (geology)|fractures]], [[Fault (geology)|faults]], and other geological structures into either ''lithologically conditioned meanders'' or ''structurally controlled meanders''.&lt;ref name="Fairbridge1968a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barbour2008a"/&gt;

=== Oxbow lakes ===
{{main|Oxbow lake}}
The '''[[oxbow lake]]''', which is the most common type of fluvial lake, is a crescent-shaped lake that derives its name from its distinctive curved shape.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson1957a"&gt;Hutchinson, G.E. 1957. ''A treatise on limnology, v. 1. Geography, Physics and Chemistry.'' Wiley. 1015p.&lt;/ref&gt; Oxbow lakes are also known as '''cutoff lakes'''.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt; Such lakes form regularly in undisturbed floodplains as a result of the normal process of fluvial meandering. Either a river or stream forms a sinuous channel as the outer side of its bends are eroded away and sediments accumulate on the inner side, which forms a meandering horseshoe-shaped bend. Eventually as the result of its meandering, the fluvial channel cuts through the narrow neck of the meander and forms a cutoff meander. The final break-through of the neck, which is called a '''neck cutoff''', often occurs during a major flood because that is when the watercourse is out of its banks and can flow directly across the neck and erode it with the full force of the flood.&lt;ref name="Fisk1944a"&gt;Fisk, H.N., 1944. ''Geological investigation of the alluvial valley of the lower Mississippi River.'' War Department, Corps of Engineers, Mississippi River Commission, Vicksburg, Mississippi. 78 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ToonenOthers2012a"&gt;Toonen, W.H., Kleinhans, M.G. and Cohen, K.M., 2012. "Sedimentary architecture of abandoned channel fills." ''[[Earth Surface Processes and Landforms]]'', 37(4), pp. 459–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a cutoff meander is formed, river water flows into its end from the river builds small delta-like feature into either end of it during floods. These delta-like features block either end of the cutoff meander to form a stagnant oxbow lake that is separated from the flow of the fluvial channel and independent of  the river. During floods, the flood waters deposit fine-grained sediment into the oxbow lake. As a result, oxbow lakes tend to become filled in with fine-grained, organic-rich sediments over time.&lt;ref name="Fisk1944a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ToonenOthers2012a"/&gt;

=== Point bar ===
{{main|Point bar}}
A '''[[point bar]]''', which is also known as a '''meander bar''', is a [[Bar (river morphology)|fluvial bar]] that is formed by the slow, often episodic, addition of individual accretions of noncohesive sediment on the inside bank of a meander by the accompanying migration of the channel toward its outer bank.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReineckOthers2012a"/&gt; This process is called lateral accretion. Lateral accretion occurs mostly during high water or floods when the point bar is submerged. Typically, the sediment consists of either sand, gravel, or a combination of both. The sediment comprising some point bars might grade downstream into silty sediments. Because of the decreasing velocity and strength of current from the thalweg of the channel to the upper surface of point bar when the sediment is deposited the vertical sequence of sediments comprising a point bar becomes finer upward within an individual point bar. For example, it is typical for point bars to fine upward from gravel at the base to fine sands at the top. The source of the sediment is typically upstream cut banks from which sand, rocks and debris has been eroded, swept, and rolled across the bed of the river and downstream to the inside bank of a river bend. On the inside bend, this sediment and debris is eventually deposited on the slip-off slope of a point bar.&lt;ref name="NeuendorfOthers2005a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReineckOthers2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Chant2002a"/&gt;

=== Scroll-bars ===
Scroll-bars are a result of continuous lateral migration of a meander loop that creates an asymmetrical ridge and swale topography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00288306.1996.9514708 | author = Woolfe and Purdon | journal = New Zealand Journal of Geology and Geophysics | last2 = Purdon | first2 = Richard | title = Deposits of a rapidly eroding meandering river: terrace cut and fill in the Taupo Volcanic Zone | year = 1996 | volume = 39 | pages = 243–249 | issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the inside of the bends.

Whipple | journal = Surface Processes and Landscape Evolution | title = Alluvial channels and their landforms | date = September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carve sediment from the outside of the curve and deposit sediment in the slower flowing water on the inside of the loop, in a process called lateral accretion. Scroll-bar sediments are characterized by cross-bedding and a pattern of fining upward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Sam Boggs, Jr. | title = Principles of Sedimentology and Stratigraphy | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2003 |edition = 4 | location = NJ | isbn = 0-13-099696-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These characteristics are a result of the dynamic river system, where larger grains are transported during high energy flood events and then gradually die down, depositing smaller material with time (Batty 2006). Deposits for meandering rivers are generally homogeneous and laterally extensive unlike the more heterogeneous braided river deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = G. Wasser | publisher = Canadian Natural Resource Limited | title = A Comparison Of Meandering River Deposits From The Middle Belly River And Horsefly With Recent Milk River Valley Deposits; Central And Southern Alberta | location = Calgary, Alberta | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are two distinct patterns of scroll-bar depositions; the eddy accretion scroll bar pattern and the point-bar scroll pattern. When looking down the river valley they can be distinguished because the point-bar scroll patterns are convex and the eddy accretion scroll bar patterns are concave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Norman D. Smith and John Rogers | title = Fluvial Sedimentology | edition = 6 | publisher = blackwell publishing | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-632-05354-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scroll bars often look lighter at the tops of the ridges and darker in the swales. This is because the tops can be shaped by wind, either adding fine grains or by keeping the area unvegetated, while the darkness in the swales can be attributed to silts and clays washing in during high water periods. This added sediment in addition to water that catches in the swales is in turn is a favorable environment for vegetation that will also accumulate in the swales.

=== Slip-off slope ===
{{main|Slip-off slope}}
Depending upon whether a meander is part of an entrenched river or part of a freely meandering river within a floodplain, the term '''slip-off slope''' can refer to two different fluvial landforms that comprise the inner, convex, bank of a meander loop. In case of a freely meandering river on a floodplain, a ''slip-off slope'' is the inside, gently sloping bank of a meander on which sediments episodically accumulate to form a point bar as a river meanders. This type of slip-off slope is located opposite the cutbank.&lt;ref name="SchefferOthers2015"&gt;Scheffers, A.M., May, S.M. and Kelletat, D.H., 2015. ''Forms by Flowing Water (Fluvial Features).'' In ''Landforms of the World with Google Earth.'' (pp. 183–244). Springer, Amsterdam, Netherlands. 391 pp. {{ISBN|978-94-017-9712-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term can also be applied to the inside, sloping bank of a meandering tidal channel.&lt;ref name="KeckOthers1973"&gt;Keck, R., Maurer, D. and Watling, L., 1973. ''Tidal stream development and its effect on the distribution of the American oyster.'' ''Hydrobiologia'', 42(4), pp. 369–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of an entrenched river, a ''slip-off slope'' is a gently sloping bedrock surface that rises from the inside, concave bank of an asymmetrically entrenched river. This type of slip-off slope is often covered by a thin, discontinuous  layer of alluvium. It is produced by the gradual outward migration of the meander as a river cuts downward into bedrock.&lt;ref name="Davis1913a"&gt;Davis, W.M., 1913. ''Meandering valleys and underfit rivers.'' ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', 3(1), pp. 3–28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crickmay1960a"&gt;Crickmay, C.H., 1960. ''Lateral activity in a river of northwestern Canada.'' ''The Journal of Geology'', 68(4), pp. 377–391.&lt;/ref&gt; A terrace on the slip-off slope of a meander spur, known as '''slip-off slope terrace''', can formed by a brief halt during the irregular incision by an actively meandering river.&lt;ref name="HerrmannOthers2014a"&gt;Herrmann, H. and Bucksch, H., 2014.

Nathan |title=Stream Hydrology: an Introduction for Ecologists: Second Edition|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year=2005|isbn=0-470-84357-8|pages=183–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a means of quantifying how much a [[river]] or [[stream]] meanders (how much its course deviates from the shortest possible path). It is calculated as the [[length]] of the stream divided by the length of the [[valley]]. A perfectly straight river would have a meander ratio of 1 (it would be the same length as its valley), while the higher this [[ratio]] is above 1, the more the river meanders.

Sinuosity indices are calculated from the map or from an aerial photograph measured over a distance called the reach, which should be at least 20 times the average fullbank channel width. The length of the stream is measured by channel, or thalweg, length over the reach, while the bottom value of the ratio is the downvalley length or air distance of the stream between two points on it defining the reach.

The sinuosity index plays a part in mathematical descriptions of streams. The index may require elaboration, because the valley may meander as well—i.e., the downvalley length is not identical to the reach. In that case the valley index is the meander ratio of the valley while the channel index is the meander ratio of the channel. The channel sinuosity index is the channel length divided by the valley length and the standard sinuosity index is the channel index divided by the valley index. Distinctions may become even more subtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Singh|first=R.Y.|contribution=Interface drainage analysis of a water divide|year=2005|title=Sustainable Management of Headwater Resources: Research from Africa and India|editor-last=Jansky|editor-first=Libor|editor2-last=Haigh|editor2-first=Martin J.|editor3-last=Prasad|editor3-first=Hushila|pages=87–106|place=Tokyo, New York|publisher=United Nations University Press|isbn=92-808-1108-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sinuosity Index has a non-mathematical utility as well. Streams can be placed in categories arranged by it; for example, when the index is between 1 and 1.5 the river is sinuous, but if between 1.5 and 4, then meandering. The index is a measure also of stream velocity and sediment load, those quantities being maximized at an index of 1 (straight).

{{Politics of Iran}}

The '''Ministry of Petroleum (MOP)''' ({{lang-fa|وزارت نفت}} ''Vezârat-e Naft'') manages the [[Petroleum industry in Iran|oil industry]], the producer of oil and petrochemical products. MoP is in charge of all issues pertaining to exploration, extraction, exploitation, distribution and exportation of crude oil and oil products. In addition, according to the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20070609105936/http://www.irtp.com/data.asp?address=laws%2FExport%20Import%20Law%201380&amp;title=The%20law%20of%20Import%20and%20Export Imports and Exports Regulation Act]", issuing import licenses for such products is also among the functions of the Ministry of Petroleum.&lt;ref name="irantradelaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf |title=irantradelaw.com |publisher= |accessdate=10 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310232210/http://www.irantradelaw.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Irans-Foreign-Trade-Regime-Report.pdf |archivedate=10 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[British Petroleum|BP]], Iran's has {{convert|137.6|Goilbbl|m3}} of [[Oil reserves in Iran|proven oil reserves]] and 29.61 trillion cubic meters of [[Natural gas reserves in Iran|proven gas reserves]].

Also, it is undertake the separation of sovereignty tasks from management and development of country's oil and gas industry.

The Ministry of petroleum was established after revolution in Iran and in the interim government of [[Mehdi Bazargan|Bazargan]], after departure of Hasan Nazia, the managing director of [[National Iranian Oil Company]] from the country in 1979. The organizational structure of this ministry consists of a central headquarters and four subsidiaries, including [[National Iranian Oil Company]], [[National Iranian Gas Company]], [[National Iranian Petrochemical Company]] and [[National Iranian Oil Refining and Distribution Company]]. It monitors the operations of exploration, extraction, marketing and sale of crude oil, natural gas and oil products in the country through its subsidiaries and subsidiaries. In addition to meeting its major energy needs, the ministry supplies over 80% of foreign currency earnings by exporting crude oil and refined petroleum products.

According to the Fourth Economic, Social and Cultural Development Plan, the Government has been required to transfer at least 10% of the activities related to the exploration, extraction and production of crude oil to the [[National Iranian Oil Company#NIOC's major domestic contractors|private sector]], while in the meantime retaining its ownership of oil resources. This is also the case in other fields of the Ministry of Petroleum's activities.&lt;ref name="irantradelaw.com"/&gt;

Iran plans to invest $500 billion in the oil sector until 2025.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farsnews.com/printable.php?nn=13930319000390|title=Fars News Agency :  مدیرعامل بانک ملت: تقویت تامین مالی پتروشیمی‌ها با راه اندازی یک صندوق جدید|website=www.farsnews.com|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, US$70 billion worth of oil and gas projects are under construction.&lt;ref name="oil"/&gt; [[Ministry of Petroleum (Iran)#Revenues from crude oil|Iran's annual oil and gas revenues]] will reach $250 billion by 2015.&lt;ref name="oil"&gt;[http://www.payvand.com/news/10/dec/1216.html Mehr News Agency: Iran eyes $250 billion annual revenue in 5 years] Retrieved 22 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Ministry of petroleum of [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] was formed with the aim of applying the principle of Iranian national ownership and sovereignty to [[oil]] and [[gas]] resources, and separating sovereignty functions from company in the management and development of oil and gas industry of the country. Since the petroleum industry has a special role in the country's economy as a propellant industry and plays a key role in achieving the major goals of national economy, the ministry's performance is very important.

Iran holds 836.47 billion barrels of liquid hydrocarbon reserves (crude oil, liquids and gas condensate) and about 34 trillion gas reserves. It is ranked first in the world in terms of having a total hydrocarbon reserves and in terms of energy security in the world. Also, the privileges like geopolitical position of the country and availability of powerful human capital have given it more strength.

The National Petroleum Procurement Proposal was signed by 17 representatives of National Petroleum Commission on December 8, 1950. In the text of message was following: “we are proposing for Iranian oil industry to be announced in all regions of the country without exception under the name of well-being of Iranian people and in order to contribute to peace of the world: all exploration, extraction and exploitation operations be in the control of government.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tarikhema.org/contemporary/iranc/22476/ministry-of-petroleum-iran/|title=Ministry of petroleum iran|last=|first=|date=|work=Tarikhema.org|access-date=2018-05-19|language=fa-IR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the announcement of this proposal, “the law of oil Nationalization throughout the country and two-month extension to Petroleum Commission to study around implementation of this principle” passed in National Assembly and eventually in the Senate on March 29, 1950. Thus, The National Iranian Oil Company was established.

First board of directors of National Iranian Oil Company was constituted by implementing the law of oil industry nationalization and after expropriation of former British oil company in June 1951. Then, new rules were adopted for this new company.

The legal framework for activities of National Iranian Oil Company in discussion of hydrocarbons sources and its products was determined by approving the “Law on Development of Petrochemical Industries (with subsequent amendments)” on July 20, 1965 and the “Law on Development of Gas Industry” on May 25, 1972. In addition, the extent of Iranian or foreign companies and firms has clarified to participate in petrochemical product plans.

Finally, a detailed description of presenting and receiving proposals, signing contracts, contract termination, conservation and preventing environmental pollution, maintaining Iran's interests and pricing conditions were presented by the approval of first “Oil Act” on August 8, 1974, in addition to defining the terms and conditions of work within hydrocarbon resources of whole country.

Upon approval of first “Oil Act”, the “Law on Statute of National Iranian Oil Company” was ratified in five seasons on May 17, 1977.

“General and capital”, “subject, duties, rights and authorities of company”, “the entity of company”, “balance sheet and profit and loss account” have formed first four chapters of the statute. In the fifth chapter of this law is also addressed to “other regulations”.

Subsequently, the “Statute of National Petrochemical Company” and “Statute of National Iranian Gas Company” were approved on November 21, and November 25, 1977, respectively.

After Islamic Revolution of Iran, the editing and approval of new laws were also on the agenda of Islamic Consultative Assembly with the necessity of following some principles and with regard to departure of foreign experts. Hence, new oil law was approved on October 9, 1987.

==Constitution==
{{see also|Petroleum industry in Iran}}
The [[Iranian constitution]] prohibits the granting of petroleum rights on a [[Concession (contract)|concessionary basis]] or direct [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake. However, the 1987 Petroleum Law permits the establishment of contracts between the ministry, state companies and "local and foreign national persons and legal entities." [[Buyback contract]]s, for instance, are arrangements in which the contractor funds all investments, receives remuneration from the [[National Iranian Oil Company]] (NIOC) in the form of an allocated production share, then transfers operation of the field to NIOC after a set number of years, at which time the contract is completed.

Since the 1979 revolution in Iran, the country has been under constant US unilateral sanctions. The first U.S. sanctions against Iran were formalized in November 1979, and during the [[Iran hostage crisis|hostage crisis]], many sanctions were leveled against the Iranian government. By 1987 the import of Iranian goods into the [[United States]] had been banned. In 1995, [[President of the United States]] [[Bill Clinton]] issued [[List of United States executive orders#Bill Clinton (1993–2001)|Executive Order 12957]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treas.gov/offices/enforcement/ofac/programs/iran/iran.shtml|title=Iran Sanctions|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; banning U.S. investment in Iran's energy sector, followed a few weeks later by [[List of United States executive orders#Bill Clinton (1993–2001)|Executive Order 12959]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt; eliminating all trade and investment and virtually all interaction between the [[United States-Iran relations|United States]] and [[Iran]].

==Overview==
The National Oceanographic Partnership Program (NOPP) facilitates interagency and multi-sectoral partnerships to address federal ocean science and technology research priorities. Through this collaboration, federal agencies can leverage resources to invest in priorities that fall between agency missions or are too large for any single agency to support. In its first 20 years, NOPP invested more than $468 million to support over 200 research and education projects with over 600 partners. A comparable amount of in-kind support has been committed by the research and education community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nopp.org/|title=National Oceanographic Partnership Program – Promoting Partnerships for the Future of the Ocean, Coasts and Great Lakes|website=National Oceanographic Partnership Program|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose and Function==
NOPP was established in 1997 through the National Oceanographic Partnership Act (PL 104-201, 10 USC 7901-7903) to improve the nation’s knowledge of the ocean, with the goals of promoting national security, advancing economic development, protecting quality of life, and strengthening science education and communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title10-chapter665&amp;edition=prelim|title=[USC10] 10 USC Ch. 665: NATIONAL OCEANOGRAPHIC PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM|website=uscode.house.gov|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOPP policies are determined by the NOPP Committee, which is composed of Federal agency representatives committed to advancing ocean science and technology initiatives through partnerships. The NOPP Committee establishes NOPP implementation procedures and selects NOPP projects through agency-issued calls for proposals. The Biodiversity Ad-Hoc Working Group and Federal Renewable Ocean Energy Working Group (FROEWG) are subcommittees of the NOPP Committee focused on facilitating interagency communications and collaborations around their respective focus areas. 

NOPP also supports the Interagency Working Group on Facilities and Infrastructure (IWG-FI) and the Ocean Research Advisory Panel (ORAP). IWG-FI is a subgroup of the National Science and Technology Council’s Subcommittee on Ocean and Science Technology. IWG-FI reviews and evaluates Federal infrastructure regarding facilities (e.g., ships) necessary for conducting ocean research and observation, and is involved in evaluating future needs and planning future investments in ocean-related facilities. ORAP provides independent recommendations to federal agencies that relate to the ocean and is composed of representatives from the National Academies, state governments, academic institutions, and ocean industries. 

==Accomplishments==
NOPP has significantly impacted the realm of ocean science and technology and results from NOPP research projects have informed both federal ocean policy and federal and regional natural resource management. Through its outreach efforts and support of the National Ocean Sciences Bowl, NOPP has inspired careers in STEM fields. 

NOPP contributions have increased the volume and efficiency of ocean research and stimulated the development of applied ocean technology. Perhaps the most important role of NOPP has been to increase multi-disciplinary, cross-sector research partnering and strengthen communication about the most pressing research needs within the national ocean science community. 

In general, NOPP projects fall within the categories of ocean observation systems, marine infrastructure and technology, earth systems modelling, coastal and marine resources, ocean education, and marine life. Projects that exemplify the highest level of success in achieving NOPP goals and working in diverse sector partnerships are awarded the yearly NOPP Excellence in Partnering Award. Some examples of NOPP-funded projects include: 
* [[Integrated Ocean Observing System|U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS):]] Over 50 NOPP projects have supported IOOS, including developing independent observation systems in every marine region of the U.S. and integrating and maintaining the necessary data infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nopp.org/projects/nopp-project-table/|title=NOPP Projects Table – National Oceanographic Partnership Program|website=National Oceanographic Partnership Program|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Oso diagram.gif|thumb|Orbiting Solar Observatory diagram]]
[[Image:Delta launches OSO 8.jpg|thumb|A Delta rocket launching OSO 8 on 21 June 1975, at Cape Canaveral, Florida]]
The '''Orbiting Solar Observatory''' (abbreviated '''OSO''') Program was the name of a series of American [[space telescope]]s primarily intended to study the [[Sun]], though they also included important non-solar experiments.  Eight were launched successfully into [[Low Earth orbit]] by [[NASA]] between 1962 and 1975 using [[Delta rocket]]s.  Their primary mission was to observe an 11-year [[sun spot cycle]] in [[ultraviolet|UV]] and [[X-ray]] spectra. The initial seven (OSO 1–7) were built by [[Ball Aerospace]], then known as Ball Brothers Research Corporation (BBRC), in Boulder Colorado.&lt;ref name = "Stars to Jars"&gt;Todd Neff (2010) [http://www.earthviewmedia.com/books/jars.html From Jars to the Stars: How Ball Came to Build a Comet-Hunting Machine] Denver, CO.: Earthview Media.&lt;/ref&gt; OSO 8 was built by Hughes Space and Communications Company, in Culver City, California.

==History==
The basic design of the entire series featured a rotating section, the "Wheel," to provide gyroscopic stability.  A second section, the "Sail," was driven electrically against the Wheel's rotation, and stabilized to point at the Sun. The Sail carried pointed solar instruments, and also the array of solar photovoltaic cells which powered the spacecraft.
The critical bearing between the Wheel and the Sail was a major feature of the design, as it had to operate smoothly for months in the hard vacuum of space without normal lubrication.  It also carried both the power from the Sail and the data from the pointed solar instruments to the Wheel, where most of the spacecraft functions were located.
Additional science instruments could also be located in the Wheel, generally looking out on a rotating radius vector which scanned the sky, and also across the Sun, every few seconds.

OSO B suffered an incident during integration and checkout activities on 14 April 1964. The satellite was inside the Spin Test Facility at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]] attached to the third stage of its [[Delta C]] booster when a technician accidentally ignited the booster through static electricity. The third-stage motor activated, launched itself and the satellite into the roof, and ricocheted into a corner of the facility until burning out. Three technicians were burned to death. The satellite, although damaged, was able to be repaired using a combination of prototype parts, spare flight parts and new components. It was launched ten months later on 3 February 1965 and was designated OSO 2 on orbit.&lt;ref name="ntrs-n6711368"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670002039.pdf |title=History of Orbiting Solar Observatory, OSO-2 |publisher=NASA{{\}}Goddard Space Flight Center |date=April 1966 |id=N67-11368; TM X-55590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSO C never made it to orbit. Liftoff took place on 25 August 1965 and all went well through the second stage burn. During the coasting phase prior to third stage separation, its rocket motor ignited prematurely. This registered on ground readouts as an attitude disturbance followed by loss of second stage [[telemetry]], and although the third stage managed to separate itself, it suffered from an 18% drop in thrust. The OSO spacecraft could not attain orbital velocity and instead fell back into the atmosphere and burned up. The failure was suspected to have been caused by a modification to the igniter mechanism in the third stage after some minor technical difficulties experienced on the previous Delta C launch (TIROS 10 on 2 Jul).&lt;ref name="ntrs-n6740193"&gt;{{cite report |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19670030864.pdf |title=Delta Vehicle Flight Failure Report, Launch 33 |publisher=NASA{{\}}Goddard Space Flight Center |date=October 1966 |id=N67-40193; TM X-55988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Advanced Orbiting Solar Observatory (AOSO) program was developed in the mid 1960s as a more advanced version of the OSO series. Conceived as a polar-orbiting satellite system, these spacecraft would continuously monitor the Sun and surrounding environment with detectors and electronic imaging ranging from x-rays to visual light. Due to budget constraints, the AOSO program was cancelled in 1965. Instead, it was replaced by the OSO-I, OSO-J and OSO-K satellites. Only OSO-I, which became OSO 8, was ever launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Advanced OSO |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=AOSO |website=NASA - NSSDC - Spacecraft - Details |publisher=NASA |accessdate=5 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pantellerite''' is type of [[volcanic rock]], specifically a [[peralkaline]] [[rhyolite]]. It has a higher [[iron]] and lower [[aluminium]] composition than [[comendite]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/index.html Dictionary of Mining, Mineral, and Related Terms: Pantellerite] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420104653/http://www.maden.hacettepe.edu.tr/dmmrt/index.html |date=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is named after [[Pantelleria]], a volcanic island in the [[Strait of Sicily]] and the [[Type locality (geology)|type location]] for this rock. On Pantelleria the rock is usually found as a [[vitrophyre]] containing [[phenocryst]]s of [[anorthoclase]] or [[sanidine]].  [[Quartz]] is found only in the most strongly peralkaline rocks. [[Mafic]] [[mineral]]s may include [[aegirine]], [[fayalite]], [[aenigmatite]], [[ilmenite]], and [[Sodium|sodic]] [[amphibole]] (often [[arfvedsonite]] or ferrorichterite).&lt;ref&gt;[http://canmin.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/full/43/4/1331 White, J.C., Ren, M., and Parker, D.F., 2005, "Variation in mineralogy, temperature, and oxygen fugacity in a suite of strongly peralkaline lavas and tuffs, Pantelleria, Italy."

'''Positronium hydride''', or '''hydrogen positride'''&lt;ref name="Usukura"/&gt; is an exotic [[molecule]] consisting of a [[hydrogen]] atom bound to an [[exotic atom]] of [[positronium]] (that is a combination of an electron and a positron).  Its formula is '''PsH'''.  It was predicted to exist in 1951 by A Ore,&lt;ref&gt;

The trap was prepared by Yok Chen from the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/bes/pdf/accomplishments/files/bes_accomp_fy1992.pdf|page=9|title=FY 1992 Accomplishments - "Out of This World" Chemical Compound Observed}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment the positrons were thermalized so that they were not traveling at high speed, and they then reacted with H&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the crystal.&lt;ref name="Monge1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monge|first=M.

Schrader and F.M. Jacobsen and others at the [[Aarhus University]] in [[Denmark]]. The researchers made the positronium hydride molecules by [[particle accelerator|firing intense bursts]] of [[positron]]s into [[methane]], which has the highest density of hydrogen atoms. Upon slowing down, the positrons were captured by ordinary electrons to form positronium atoms which then reacted with hydrogen atoms from the methane.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decay==
PsH is constructed from one proton, two electrons, and one positron.  The [[binding energy]] is {{val|1.1|0.2|u=eV}}.  The lifetime of the molecule is 0.65 [[nanosecond]]s. Positronium deuteride also has the same lifetime.&lt;ref name="Monge1996"/&gt;

The decay of positronium is easily observed by detecting the two 511 keV gamma ray photons emitted in the decay.  The energy of the photons from positronium should differ slightly by the binding energy of the molecule.  However this has not yet been detected.&lt;ref name="Usukura"&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=physics/9804023|title=Signature of the existence of the positronium molecule|journal=Physical Review A|volume=58|issue=3|pages=1918|last=Usukura|first=J.|author2=K. Varga |author3=Y. Suzuki |date=22 Apr 1998|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.58.1918|bibcode = 1998PhRvA..58.1918U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The structure of PsH is as a diatomic molecule, with a chemical bond between the two positively charged centres. The electrons are more concentrated around the proton.&lt;ref name="Saito"/&gt;
Predicting the properties of PsH is a four body Coulomb problem. Calculated using the [[stochastic variational method]], the size of the molecule is larger than [[dihydrogen]], which has a bond length of 0.7413 [[angstrom|Å]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kayelaby.npl.co.uk/chemistry/3_7/3_7_2.html|title=Bond lengths and dissociation enthalpies of diatomic molecules|publisher=National Physics Laboratory Kaye and Laby tables of physical and chemical constants}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PsH the positron and proton are separated on average by 3.66 [[Bohr radius|a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]] (1.94 Å). The positronium in the molecule is swollen compared to the positronium atom, increasing to 3.48 a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; compared to 3 a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. Average distance of the electrons from the proton is larger than the dihydrogen molecule, at 2.31&amp;nbsp;a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; with the maximum density at 2.8 au.&lt;ref name="Usukura"/&gt;

==Formation==
Due to its short lifetime establishing the chemistry of positronium hydride poses difficulties.  Theoretical calculations can predict what can happen.  One method of formation is through alkali metal hydrides reacting with positrons.  Molecules with dipole moments greater than 1.625 debye are predicted to attract and hold positrons in a bound state. Crawford's model predicts this positron capture. However in the case of [[lithium hydride]], [[sodium hydride]] and [[potassium hydride]] molecules, this adduct decomposes and positronium hydride and the alkali positive ion form.&lt;ref name="Oyamada2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oyamada|first=Takayuki|author2=Masanori Tachikawa |year=2014|title=Multi-component molecular orbital study on positron attachment to alkali-metal hydride molecules: nature of chemical bonding and dissociation limits of [LiH; e+]|journal=The European Physical Journal D|volume=68|issue=8|pages=231|issn=1434-6060|doi=10.1140/epjd/e2014-40708-4|bibcode=2014EPJD...68..231O}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Provisional Military Dictatorship of Mughan''' was a [[UK|British]]-controlled [[anti-communist]] short-lived state founded in the [[Lankaran (rayon)|Lankaran region]] on August 1, 1918. The Mughan government did not support independence of [[Azerbaijan]] and it was led by [[white army|white]] [[Russian people|Russian]] colonel V.T. Sukhorukov who acted under the protection of the British occupation of [[Baku]]. Mughan declared to be an autonomous part of "single and indivisible [[Imperial Russia|Russia]]." On December 1918, it was reorganized as ''Mughan Territorial Administration''. On April 25, 1919, a violent protest organized by [[Talysh people|Talysh]] workers of pro-[[Bolshevik]] orientation exploded in [[Lankaran]] and deposed the Mughan Territorial Administration. On May 15, the Extraordinary Congress of the "Councils of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies" of Lankaran district proclaimed the ''[[Mughan Soviet Republic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smele|first1=Jonathan D.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Russian Civil Wars, 1916-1926|date=2015|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442252813|page=771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5248">{{About|physics||Pulse (disambiguation)}}

In [[physics]], a '''pulse''' is a generic term describing a single disturbance that moves through a [[transmission medium]]. This medium may be [[vacuum]] (in the case of [[electromagnetic radiation]]) or [[matter]], and may be indefinitely large or finite.

==Pulse reflection==
Consider a pulse moving through a medium - perhaps through a rope or a [[slinky]]. When the pulse reaches the end of that medium, what happens to it depends on whether the medium is fixed in space or free to move at its end. For example, if the pulse is moving through a rope and the end of the rope is held firmly by a person, then it is said that the pulse is approaching a fixed end. On the other hand, if the end of the rope is fixed to a stick such that it is free to move up or down along the stick when the pulse reaches its end, then it is said that the pulse is approaching a free end.

===Free end===
[[File:Pulse reflection free end 1.svg|thumb|Figure 1: A pulse reaching the end of the medium, the end point is free. The successive positions of the pulse is drawn black, red, green, blue, black, red, green. The final green curve is the initial curve of figure 2.]]
[[File:Pulse reflection free end 2.svg|thumb|Figure 2: The reflection of the pulse. The successive positions of the pulse is drawn green, blue, black, red, green, blue. The initial green curve is the final curve of figure 1]]

A pulse will reflect off a free end and return with the same direction of displacement that it had before reflection. That is, a pulse with an upward displacement will reflect off the end and return with an upward displacement.

This is illustrated by figures 1 and 2 that were obtained by the numerical integration of the [[Wave equation#Investigation by numerical methods|wave equation]].

===Fixed end===
[[File:Pulse reflection fixed end 1.svg|thumb|Figure 3: A pulse reaching the end of the medium, the end point is fixed. The successive positions of the pulse is drawn black, red, green, blue, black, red, green. The final green curve is the initial curve of figure 4.]]
[[File:Pulse reflection fixed end 2.svg|thumb|Figure 4: The reflection of the pulse. The successive positions of the pulse is drawn green, blue, black, red, green, blue. The initial green curve is the final curve of figure 3]]
[[Image:Wave equation 1D fixed endpoints.gif|right|thumb|250px|Figure 5: Animation corresponding to figures 3 and 4.]]

A pulse will reflect off a fixed end and return with the opposite direction of displacement. In this case, the pulse is said to have inverted.  That is, a pulse with an upward displacement will reflect off the end and return with a downward displacement.

This is illustrated by figures 3 and 4 that were obtained by the numerical integration of the [[Wave equation#Investigation by numerical methods|wave equation]]. In addition it is illustrated in the animation of figure 5.

===Crossing media===
When there exists a pulse in a medium that is connected to another less heavy or less dense medium, the pulse will reflect as if it were approaching a free end (no inversion). Contrarily, when a pulse is traveling through a medium connected to a heavier or denser medium, the pulse will reflect as if it were approaching a fixed end (inversion).

==Optical pulse==
===Dark pulse===
Dark pulses&lt;ref&gt;P. Emplit et al., Opt. Commun. 62, 374 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; are characterized by being formed from a localized reduction of intensity compared to a more intense continuous wave background. Scalar dark solitons (linearly polarized dark solitons) can be formed in all normal dispersion fiber lasers mode-locked by the nonlinear polarization rotation method and can be rather stable. Vector dark solitons&lt;ref&gt;Y.S. Kivshar and S.K. Turitsyn, Opt. Lett. 18, 337 (1993); Y.S. Kivshar and B. Luther-Davies, Phys. Rep. 298, 81 (1998), and refs. therein.&lt;/ref&gt; are much less stable due to the cross-interaction between the two polarization components. Therefore, it is interesting to investigate how the polarization state of these two polarization components evolves.

In 2008, the first dark pulse laser was reported in a quantum dot diode laser with a saturable absorber.&lt;ref&gt;M. Feng et al., CLEO, paper CThP1 (2008).http://www.opticsinfobase.org/abstract.cfm?URI=CLEO-2008-CThP1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the dark pulse fiber laser was successfully achieved in an all-normal dispersion erbium-doped fiber laser with a polarizer in cavity. Experimentation has revealed that apart from the bright pulse emission, under appropriate conditions the fiber laser could also emit single or multiple dark pulses. Based on numerical simulations, the dark pulse formation in the laser is a result of dark soliton shaping.&lt;ref&gt;Han Zhang, Dingyuan Tang, Luming Zhao and Wu Xuan,“Dark pulse emission of a fiber laser’’PHYSICAL REVIEW A 80, 045803 2009 {{cite web |url=http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home2006/ZHAN0174/pra.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717122857/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home2006/ZHAN0174/pra.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Return to the Centre of the Earth''''' is a [[studio album]] by the English keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]], released on 15 March 1999 on [[EMI Classics]]. The album is a sequel to his 1974 [[concept album]] ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', itself based on the same-titled [[A Journey to the Centre of the Earth|science fiction novel]] by [[Jules Verne]]. Wakeman wrote a new story of three unnamed travellers who attempt to follow the original journey two hundred years later, including the music which features guest performances from [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Tony Mitchell (musician)|Tony Mitchell]], [[Trevor Rabin]], [[Justin Hayward]], and [[Katrina Leskanich]]. The story is narrated by [[Patrick Stewart]]. Recording was delayed after Wakeman was hospitalised with a life threatening case of double [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]], and needed time to recover.

Upon release, the album reached number 34 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

== Background ==
In 1974, Wakeman released his second solo album ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Earth (album)|Journey to the Centre of the Earth]]'', a [[concept album]] based on the same-titled [[A Journey to the Centre of the Earth|science fiction novel]] by [[Jules Verne]]. It tells the story of Professor Lidenbrook, his nephew Axel, and their guide Hans who follow a passage to the Earth's centre originally discovered by Arne Saknussemm, an Icelandic [[alchemist]]. The idea to produce a sequel album first came to Wakeman in 1991 during a solo tour of Italy, when a journalist suggested to record a new and extended version of ''Journey'' with new technology. Several weeks later, during the Union Tour with [[Yes (band)|Yes]], Wakeman set up the tentative plan of re-recording the album live in concert with added music in time for its twentieth anniversary in 1994.&lt;ref name=1999interview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yesmuseum.org/WakeView1.html|title=Rick Wakeman - Interview - Madrid, 21th [sic] April 1999|publisher=YesMuseum.org|date=21 April 1999|accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour's stop in New York City, Wakeman visited the office of [[Arista Records]] and spoke about the idea to an acquaintance, but it was turned down. Wakeman recalled, "He said ... you recorded and wrote [''Journey''] with what you knew existed with instruments and recording techniques, so you pushed as far you could go. Now if you do it again, is different because you would not be pushing anything".&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; Wakeman was advised to put the idea on hold and think about a new "epic" album with a new story and music, of which he'll "know when the right time is".&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt;

After the meeting at Arista, Wakeman went on to pursue other projects and forgot about the idea until it was revisited in 1996, when he received telephone calls from four record companies within a period of two months, willing to fund and release a new "epic" album from him. "By the time of the first call I thought: 'Perhaps this is what my friend [at Arista] meant, because it appears to be a good time'".&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; After working about a possible budget for a new album, one of the record companies dropped out but interest from the remaining three had remained. Wakeman began the search for its story which started with Verne's other famous novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'', and proceeded to write music for it. He scrapped the idea soon after, partly due to [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Richard Branson#World record attempts|world record attempts]] to circumnavigate the Earth by hot air balloon and thinking people will relate his music to the event.&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; Soon after, Wakeman came across a newspaper article by [[Steven Spielberg]], "who was talking about have sequels for making films, how you have a story and you spin up from the story for a whole new story, but you have a relationship, which is very comfortable for the people who listen a whole new story, new characters, but there's still a relationship."&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; This prompted the thought in Wakeman's mind, after revisiting the original book of ''Journey'', a new story, set two hundred years later, around three travellers who followed the original route but descend from a different entrance so they could experience a new journey.&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt; Wakeman purposefully unassigned names or genders for the travellers, "because they could be the person listening".&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt;

Wakeman's new idea was well received by the three record companies, and he was asked to produce a [[demo tape]] of some songs, narration, and orchestral parts. However, a problem arose when Wakeman was asked about his backing band as he wished for them and the orchestra not to be restricted to one style, and in his mind saw each group perform a variety of styles, playing "rock things, heavy metal ... I want the band playing a classical thing".&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; Despite being told to continue with the demo regardless, Wakeman expressed some concern about whether his idea was understood properly by the labels; his two eldest sons, [[Oliver Wakeman|Oliver]] and [[Adam Wakeman]], advised him not to do the album if it could not be produced to his liking.&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; Wakeman came close to shelving the entire project until Nic Caciappo, an editor of the Yes information service and magazine in California, told his friend Dwight Dereiter of [[Capitol Records|EMI-Capitol]] at a dinner about Wakeman's problem. A synopsis of the album was sent to Dereiter, who liked it and forwarded it to the European office of [[EMI Classics]], the label's classical music division, as he thought they would understand it better.&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; With further assistance from Frank Rodgers of the music publisher The Product Exchange who soon took over as management for the project, the idea arrived at label president Richard Lyttelton, who invited Wakeman to lunch to discuss the album further in February 1998. Lyttleton supported Wakeman's idea and offered a recording contract, agreeing to put a further £100,000 into the budget and release the album, which Wakeman accepted.&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt;&lt;ref name=beatmagazine2003&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.pertout.com/Wakeman.htm|title=Rick Wakeman: Return to the Centre of the Earth – Part II|magazine=Mixdown Monthly, Beat Magazine|date=5 February 2003|issue=106|first=Andrian|last=Pertout|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recording ==
Recording began in March 1998 and took place in six different locations, including Wakeman's home studio named Bajonor on the [[Isle of Man]].&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt; In its original form the album had a running time of 126 minutes, leaving Wakeman having to cut it down to under 80 minutes in order to fit it on a single compact disc. The result, Wakeman said, resulted in a more "direct" album.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt; He purposefully kept the music a secret from his family, which Oliver thought was strange as he usually plays his work to them. Adam assisted in the choir arrangements.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;

Lyttelton wanted Wakeman to record the album with a group of musicians that he had never worked with before in order to push Wakeman and the album to "new limits". The idea was strange to Wakeman at first as he already had his rock band the English Rock Ensemble, but said Lyttelton was "100% right" in his suggestion when the album was finished.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt; To perform his music, Wakeman recruited guitarist [[Fraser T Smith|Fraser Thorneycroft-Smith]], bassist Phil Williams, and drummer [[Simon Hanson]].&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt; Lyttelton gave Wakeman the freedom of choosing the singers for the album, suggesting to use "the right singer for the right song".&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt; Wakeman chose singers of a variety of backgrounds and styles to perform guest lead vocals on six tracks; "Buried Alive" is sung by [[Ozzy Osbourne]], "Is Anybody There?" by [[Bonnie Tyler]], "Mr. Slow" by [[Tony Mitchell (musician)|Tony Mitchell]], "Never is a Long, Long Time" by [[Trevor Rabin]], "Still Waters Run Deep" by [[Justin Hayward]], and "Ride of Your Life" by [[Katrina Leskanich]].&lt;ref name=linernotes/&gt;

A narrator was not decided upon until shortly before Wakeman signed his contract with EMI when Gilbert Heatherwick, the head of EMI in the United States, asked who would take the role and suggested English actor [[Patrick Stewart]]. Wakeman was aware of the higher cost of booking Stewart, but Lyttelton liked the suggestion and agreed. Stewart's parts were recorded in August 1998 at POP Sound Studios in [[Santa Monica]], California at a session that was originally booked for two hours. However, Stewart enjoyed the experience so much he allowed the session to continue for the entire day at no extra cost, cancelling the other arrangements he had scheduled.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;

Recording was disrupted midway through the recording process by Wakeman's failing health. For three months, he worked 22-hour days on the album which took a toll on him mentally and physically.{{sfn|Popoff|2016|p=141}} In August 1998, shortly after his arrival from recording Stewart's narration tracks in Los Angeles, Wakeman was hospitalised after he collapsed on a golf course with a life threatening case of double [[pneumonia]] and [[pleurisy]], and showed signs of [[Legionnaire's disease]]. At one point, his doctors gave him just 48 hours to live.{{sfn|Popoff|2016|p=141}} Wakeman's illness led to the initial dates for recording the orchestra to be cancelled and rearranged for December 1998.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;

For the orchestra, Wakeman originally suggested to use a symphony orchestra and choir from [[Belgrade]] with an unknown narrator in order to keep the album's budget at a minimum, but Lyttelton felt happy to use a more well known one and was later glad he "resisted the temptation" to go with Wakeman's idea as he wanted to make the album "to the fullest". The two agreed to use the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[English Chamber Choir]] that alone added £122,000 to the budget.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt; When it came to recording their parts at Studio 1 at CTS Studios in [[Wembley]], London, Wakeman recalled the experience as the most nerve wrecking experience of his music career. Shortly before the orchestra played, he recalled: "I will hear for the very first time whether at all the arrangements I have done will work, will sound perfect or whether it'll sound terrible, as if the LSO was a third rate brass band. I asked myself what these EMI directors would've done if it had sounded terrible. ... Those final twenty seconds have been the most silent twenty seconds of my life. As if in slow motion I saw the baton going up and even when I only heard a rough mix in the control room it was as if thick clouds were making way for the sun to emerge. That moment all stress left my body as I turned around and only saw laughing faces. If I still had doubts, they all left that same instance."&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;

When recording for the album was finished in December 1998, almost 300 people were involved with the making of the album,&lt;ref name=linernotes&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Return to the Centre of the Earth|date=1999|publisher=EMI Classics|id=724355676320|people=Wakeman, Rick}}&lt;/ref&gt; which cost £2 million to produce, a considerable amount of money in comparison to Wakeman's earlier albums which were produced on much lower budgets.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=1998pressrelease&gt;''Return to the Centre of the Earth'' press release (1 October 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; Wakeman heard the album in its entirety for the first time on 17 December 1998, and received a CD of it in mid-January 1999.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;

On 9 February 1999, the album received a 300-guest launch party arranged by EMI at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]], London.&lt;ref name=pw2000&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.progressiveworld.net/html/modules.php/modules/www.ukreunion.com/modules.php?name=Interviews&amp;rop=showcontent&amp;id=243|publisher=Progressiveworld.net|title=The Return of Rick Wakeman!|first=John|last=Bollenberg|date=22 January 2000|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's release followed on 15 March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60468153.html|title=Rock; BARENAKED Ambition|date=19 February 1999|newspaper=Coventry Evening Telegraph|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18682730.html|title=The fall guy and the Yes man|newspaper=The Scotsman|first=Aidan|last=Smith|date=5 March 1999|accessdate=30 January 2017|via=Highbeam Research|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; A promotional "radio edit" of the album was made with the songs edited to around four minutes, and distributed to radio stations to allow the album to gain airplay.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt; It reached a peak of number 34 on the [[UK Albums Chart]] during its three-week stay on the chart. EMI set a goal of selling 300,000 copies of the album worldwide, but sales had only reached 195,000 copies two years after its release. Targets were met in each territory except the United States, where just 25,000 copies were sold which Wakeman felt disappointed about.{{sfn|Popoff|2016|p=140}}

The album received mixed reviews from music critics. The ''[[Birmingham Mail|Birmingham Evening Mail]]'' wrote the album is "twice as long and equally as ambitious" as the original and rates Stewart's "precise narration". The orchestra and choir "enter into the spirit of things with gusto", but the review concluded with "expect a punk rock backlash in the year 2001".&lt;ref name=birminghammail/&gt; A review in ''[[The Boston Herald]]'' by Kevin R. Convey gave the album 1-and-a-half stars out of five, saying Wakeman "hasn't lost his touch" and that the sequel "is every bit as pompous and bombastic as the original", which contained a "thoroughly silly script" for its narration and "risible" lyrics. Convey concluded: "Those who love ''Journey'' probably will enjoy this as well. Others may want to find more creative ways to give themselves a headache".&lt;ref name=bostonherald/&gt; In October 1999, a review from Shawn Perry for [[About.com]] praised Stewart's performance for his "infectious precision" in his narration and the album's opening of "lush orchestrations, slyly garnishing Stewert's poignant articulations throughout". Perry thought Wakeman's keyboards sound "seemingly shrouded ... certainly not as distinctive as Wakeman's sound can be", but welcomed "Buried Alive" as the point when the album "sonically surges forward" and for Osbourne's vocals and Wakeman's solo. From then on, Perry thought the album takes an "ethereal tone ... with no real central theme to convey" but considered Tyler's and Hayward's songs as highlights. Perry concluded that the album acts as a "self-fulfilling aspiration" for Wakeman, and thought the audience lack the patience to sit through the album.&lt;ref name=vintagerock/&gt;

==Live performances==
Initially, Wakeman wanted to perform the album on the Spanish island of [[Tenerife]], as close to [[Teide|Mount Teide]] as possible, with the [[Orquesta Sinfónica de Tenerife]], but the difficulties in performing around such an ecological area led to the idea being scrapped.&lt;ref name=1999interview/&gt; Material from ''Return to the Centre of the Earth'' was performed live for the first time as part of Wakeman's 25-date Half a Century Tour, playing a selection of material across his career in churches and cathedrals across the United Kingdom from May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18694780.html|title='Prog rocker' tours houses of the holy|date=2 June 1999|newspaper=The Scotsman|first=Paula|last=Batters|accessdate=30 January 2017|subscription=yes|via=Highbeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tour of the album, complete with a stage set designed by Dean, was shelved.&lt;ref name=pw2000/&gt;

Wakeman has performed the album live in its entirety twice, both times in [[Québec]], Canada. The premiere took place on 30 June 2001 in [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]] with Wakeman's band the English Rock Ensemble, then formed of his son [[Adam Wakeman]] on keyboards, guitarist Ant Glynne, bassist Lee Pomeroy, and drummer [[Tony Fernandez (musician)|Tony Fernandez]]. Vocals were performed in English by [[Luck Mervil]] and Fabiola Toupin. The second performance followed on 15 July 2006 on the [[Plains of Abraham]], [[Quebec City]] as part of the annual [[Quebec City Summer Festival]]. Wakeman was accompanied by a 45-piece orchestra conducted by [[Gilles Bellemare (composer)|Gilles Bellemare]], the 20-piece Vocalys Ensemble Choir, the English Rock Ensemble, and guest vocals by [[Jon Anderson]], [[Annie Villeneuve]], and Vincent Marois, with narration from [[Guy Nadon]]. The concert was accompanied by giant screens and a light and firework display. Wakeman has stated that this show was the highlight of his career.{{citation needed|date = December 2011}}

{{Sound measurements}}'''Sound energy''' is a [[energy|form of energy]] related with the [[vibration]] of [[matter]]. The [[International System of Units|SI unit]] of sound energy is the [[joule]] (J). Sound is a [[mechanical wave]] and as such consists physically in [[Oscillation|oscillatory]] elastic [[Compression (physics)|compression]] and in oscillatory displacement of a [[fluid]]. Therefore, the [[transmission medium|medium]] acts as [[Energy storage|storage]] for both [[Potential energy|potential]] and [[kinetic energy]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently, the sound energy in a volume of interest is defined as the sum of the potential and kinetic [[Energy density|energy densities]] integrated over that volume:
:&lt;math&gt;W = W_\mathrm{potential} + W_\mathrm{kinetic} = \int_V \frac{p^2}{2 \rho_0 c^2}\, \mathrm{d}V + \int_V \frac{\rho v^2}{2}\, \mathrm{d}V,&lt;/math&gt;
Here:
*''V'' is the volume of interest;
*''p'' is the [[sound pressure]];
*''v'' is the [[particle velocity]];
*''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[density]] of the medium without sound present;
*''ρ'' is the local [[density]] of the medium;

[[Image:Mohave Generating Station 1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mohave Generating Station, a 1,580 MW steam-electric power plant near [[Laughlin, Nevada]] fuelled by coal]]

The '''steam-electric power station''' is a [[power station]] in which the electric generator is [[steam]] driven. Water is heated, turns into steam and spins a [[steam turbine]] which drives an [[electric generator|electrical generator]]. After it passes through the turbine, the steam is [[Condensation|condensed]] in a [[Surface condenser|condenser]]. The greatest variation in the design of steam-electric power plants is due to the different fuel sources.

Almost all [[Fossil fuel power plant|coal]], [[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[geothermal power|geothermal]], [[solar thermal electric]] power plants, [[incineration|waste incineration plants]] as well as many natural gas power plants are steam-electric. [[Natural gas]] is frequently [[Flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion|combusted]] in [[gas turbine]]s as well as [[boiler]]s.  The waste heat from a gas turbine can be used to raise steam, in a [[combined cycle]] plant that improves overall efficiency.

Worldwide, most [[electric power]] is produced by steam-electric power plants, which produce about 86% of all electric generation{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}. The only other types of plants that currently have a significant contribution are [[hydroelectric]] and gas turbine plants, which can burn natural gas or [[diesel fuel|diesel]]. [[Photovoltaic panel]]s, [[wind turbine]]s and binary cycle geothermal plants are also non-steam electric, but currently do not produce much electricity.

==History==
Reciprocating steam engines have been used for mechanical power sources since the 18th Century, with notable improvements being made by [[James Watt]].  The very first commercial central electrical generating stations in New York and London,  in 1882,  also used reciprocating steam engines. As generator sizes increased, eventually turbines took over due to higher efficiency and lower cost of construction.  By the 1920s any central station larger than a few thousand kilowatts would use a turbine prime mover.

==Efficiency==
The electric efficiency of a conventional steam-electric power plant, considered as saleable energy produced at the plant busbars compared with the heating value of the fuel consumed, is typically 33 to 48% efficient, limited as all heat engines are by the laws of [[thermodynamic]]s (See: [[Carnot cycle]]). The rest of the energy must leave the plant in the form of heat. This [[waste heat]] can be disposed of with [[cooling water]] or in [[cooling tower]]s. If the waste heat is instead utilized for e.g. [[district heating]], it is called [[cogeneration]]. An important class of steam power plants are associated with [[desalination]] facilities; these are typically found in desert countries with large supplies of [[natural gas]] and in these plants, freshwater production and electricity are equally important co-products.

Since the efficiency of the plant is fundamentally limited by the ratio of the absolute temperatures of the steam at turbine input and output, efficiency improvements require use of higher temperature, and therefore higher pressure, steam. Historically, other working fluids such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] have been experimentally used in a [[mercury vapour turbine]] power plant, since these can attain higher temperatures than water at lower working pressures. However, the obvious hazards of toxicity, and poor heat transfer properties, have ruled out mercury as a working fluid.

==Steam plant==

===Condenser===
{{main|Surface condenser}}

[[Image:Surface Condenser.png|thumb|right|354px|Diagram of a typical water-cooled surface condenser]]

Steam-electric power plants utilize a [[surface condenser]] cooled by water circulating through tubes.  The steam which was used to turn the [[turbine]] is exhausted into the condenser.  The steam is therefore condensed as it comes in contact with the cool tubes full of circulating water.  This condensed steam is withdrawn from the bottom of the surface condenser. The condensed steam is now water, commonly referred to as [[Condensation|condensate]] water.

The adjacent image is a diagram of one of the many typical surface condenser designs.&lt;ref name=Babcock&gt;{{cite book|author=Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co.|title=Steam: Its Generation and Use|edition=41st|year=2005|isbn=0-9634570-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas C. Elliott, Kao Chen, Robert Swanekamp (coauthors)|title=Standard Handbook of Powerplant Engineering|edition=2nd|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|year=1997|isbn=0-07-019435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/eog/course422/ce6b3.html Air Pollution Control Orientation Course] from website of the Air Pollution Training Institute&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf Energy savings in steam systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225000/http://kolmetz.com/pdf/ENERGY%20EFFICIENCY%20IMPROVEMENT.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} ''Figure 3a, Layout of surface condenser'' (scroll to page 11 of 34 pdf pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

For best efficiency, the temperature in the condenser must be kept as low as practical in order to achieve the lowest possible pressure in the condensing steam.  Since the condenser temperature can almost always be kept significantly below 100 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C where the [[vapor pressure]] of water is much less than atmospheric pressure, the condenser generally works under [[vacuum]]. Thus leaks of non-condensable air into the closed loop must be prevented.  Plants operating in hot climates may have to reduce output if their source of condenser cooling water becomes warmer; unfortunately this usually coincides with periods of high electrical demand for [[air conditioning]].   If a good source of cooling water is not available, [[cooling tower]]s may be used to reject waste heat to the atmosphere.  A large river or lake can also be used as a ''heat sink'' for cooling the condensers; temperature rises in naturally occurring waters may have undesirable ecological effects, but may also incidentally improve yields of fish in some circumstances.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Feedwater heater===
{{main|Feedwater heater}}
[[Image:feedwater-heating.png|thumb|right|375px|A [[Rankine cycle]] with a two-stage [[steam turbine]] and a single feedwater heater.]]

In the case of a conventional steam-electric power plant utilizing a [[drum boiler]], the surface condenser removes the [[latent heat of vaporization]] from the steam as it changes states from vapor to liquid. The heat content ([[btu]]) in the steam is referred to as [[Enthalpy]]. The condensate pump then pumps the condensate water through a [[feedwater heater]]. The feedwater heating equipment then raises the temperature of the water by utilizing extraction steam from various stages of the turbine.&lt;ref name=Babcock/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elliott/&gt;

Preheating the feedwater reduces the irreversibilities involved in steam generation and therefore improves the [[thermodynamic efficiency]] of the system.&lt;ref name=Weston&gt;[http://www.personal.utulsa.edu/~kenneth-weston/chapter2.pdf Fundamentals of Steam Power] by Kenneth Weston, [[University of Tulsa]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This reduces plant operating costs and also helps to avoid [[thermal shock]] to the boiler metal when the feedwater is introduced back into the steam cycle.

===Boiler===
Once this water is again inside the [[boiler]] or [[Water-tube boiler|steam generator]], the process of adding the [[latent heat of vaporization]] or [[Enthalpy]] is underway. The boiler transfers energy to the water by the chemical reaction of burning some type of fuel.  The water enters the boiler through a section in the convection pass called the [[economizer]]. From the economizer it passes to the steam drum. Once the water enters the steam drum it goes down the downcomers to the lower inlet waterwall headers. From the inlet headers the water rises through the waterwalls and is eventually turned into steam due to the heat being generated by the burners located on the front and rear waterwalls (typically). As the water is turned into steam/vapor in the waterwalls, the steam/vapor once again enters the steam drum. The steam/vapor is passed through a series of steam and water separators and then dryers inside the [[steam drum]].  The [[steam separator]]s and dryers remove the water droplets from the steam and the cycle through the waterwalls is repeated. This process is known as [[natural circulation]].

Any droplets of liquid water carried over into the turbine can produce destructive erosion of the turbine blades.

[[Image:NesjavellirPowerPlant edit2.jpg|thumb|Geothermal power station in Iceland]]

Geothermal plants need no boiler since they use naturally occurring steam sources. Heat exchangers may be used where the geothermal steam is very corrosive or contains excessive suspended solids.  Nuclear plants also boil water to raise steam, either directly passing the working steam through the reactor or else using an intermediate heat exchanger.

===Superheater===
As the steam is conditioned by the drying equipment inside the drum, it is piped from the upper drum area into an elaborate set up of tubing in different areas of the boiler.  The areas known as [[superheater]] and reheater. The steam vapor picks up energy and its temperature is now superheated above the saturation temperature.   The superheated steam is then piped through the main steam lines to the valves of the high-pressure turbine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3346">A '''steam accumulator''' is an [[Thermal insulation|insulated]] steel pressure tank containing hot water and [[steam]] under [[pressure]].  It is a type of [[energy storage]] device. It can be used to smooth out peaks and troughs in demand for steam.  Steam accumulators may take on a significance for energy storage in [[solar thermal energy]] projects. An example is the [[PS10 solar power tower]] plant near [[Seville]], [[Spain]]&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Pimlico accumulator tower 1.jpg|thumb|right|District heating steam accumulator tower on the [[Churchill Gardens]] Estate, [[Pimlico]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]. This plant once used [[waste heat]] piped from [[Battersea Power Station]] on the opposite side of the [[River Thames]]. (January 2006)]]

==History==

It was invented in 1874 by the Scottish engineer [[Andrew Betts Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Andrew_Betts_Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charge==
The tank is about half-filled with cold water and steam is blown in from a [[boiler]] via a perforated pipe near the bottom of the drum.  Some of the steam [[Condensation|condenses]] and heats the water.  The remainder fills the space above the water level.  When the accumulator is fully charged the condensed steam will have raised the water level in the drum to about three-quarters full and the [[temperature]] and pressure will also have risen.

==Discharge==
Steam can be drawn off as required, either for driving a [[steam turbine]] or for process purposes (e.g. in [[chemical engineering]]), by opening a steam [[valve]] on top of the drum.  The pressure in the drum will fall but the reduced pressure causes more water to boil and the accumulator can go on supplying steam (while gradually reducing pressure and temperature) for some time before it has to be re-charged.

The '''Tiaojishan Formation''' is a [[geological formation]] in [[Hebei]] and [[Liaoning]], [[People's Republic of China]], dating to the middle-[[late Jurassic]] period ([[Bathonian]]-[[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]] stages). It is known for its [[Paleobotany|fossil plant]]s, and is made up mainly of [[pyroclastic rock]] interspersed with basic volcanic and [[sedimentary rock]]s. Previously, the Tiaojishan Formation was grouped together with the underlying [[Haifanggou Formation]] (also known as the Jiulongshan Formation) as a single "'''Lanqui Formation'''."&lt;ref name="wangetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Y. | last2 = Ken | first2 = S. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = W. | last4 = Zheng | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Biodiversity and palaeoclimate of the Middle Jurassic floras from the Tiaojishan Formation in western Liaoning, China | url = | journal = Progress in Natural Science | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 222–230 | doi = 10.1080/10020070612330087 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Most researchers now agree that the '''Daohugou Bed''', of formerly controversial dating, is a part of the Tiaojishan formation.&lt;ref name=megaconus/&gt;

== Geology ==
The geology of the Daohugou Bed is confusing because it is complex and does not conform; meaning that elements and layers of rock of different ages are mixed up together by folding and erosion and by volcanic activity. Liu et al. (2006) concluded that the rocks that bear the '''Daohugou Biota''' also include the Tiaojishan and Lanqi Formations. They demonstrated that the [[Jiulongshan Formation]] is older ([[Middle Jurassic]]), and that the [[Tuchengzi Formation]] is younger ([[Late Jurassic]]). However, many other researchers consider the Daohugou to be a part of the Jiulongshan Formation itself.&lt;ref name=nephilajurassica&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Selden | first1 = P.

Fieldwork published in 2006 has also found that the beds are consistent over a large area; from western [[Liaoning]] into [[Ningcheng]] county of [[Inner Mongolia]] (Nei Mongol).&lt;ref name= "Wangetal06"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = X. | last2 = Zhou | first2 = Z. | last3 = He | first3 = H. | last4 = Jin | first4 = F. | last5 = Wang | first5 = Y. | last6 = Zhang | first6 = J. | last7 = Wang | first7 = Y. | last8 = Xu | first8 = X. | last9 = Zhang | first9 = F. | year = 2005 | title = Stratigraphy and age of the Daohugou Bed in Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia | url = | journal = Chinese Science Bulletin | volume = 50 | issue = 20| pages = 2369–2376 | doi=10.1360/982005-581}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age ==
Using [[Argon–argon dating]], Wang and colleagues in 2005 dated part of the Tiaojishan Formation to about 160 million years ago, the beginning of the [[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian stage]], the first stage of the [[Upper Jurassic]] epoch.&lt;ref name="wangetal2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Xiaolin Wang |author2=Zhonghe Zhou |author3=Huaiyu He |author4=Fan Jin |author5=Yuanqing Wang |author6=Jiangyong Zhang |author7=Yuan Wang |author8=Xing Xu |author9=Fucheng Zhang  | year = 2005 | title = Stratigraphy and age of the Daohugou Bed in Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia | url = | journal = Chinese Science Bulletin | volume = 50 | issue = 20| pages = 2369–2376 |doi=10.1007/BF03183749|bibcode=2005ChSBu..50.2369W }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a study by Liu and colleagues  used [[Zircon#Radiometric dating|U-Pb zircon dating]] to conclude that the Tiaojishan Formation correlates with the Daohugou Beds, and the complete chronological range of this shared biota dates to between 168 and 164/152 Ma ago.&lt;ref name="Liuetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y. | last2 = Liu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Ji | first3 = S. | last4 = Yang | first4 = Z. | year = 2006 | title = U-Pb zircon age for the Daohugou Biota at Ningcheng of Inner Mongolia and comments on related issues | url = | journal = Chinese Science Bulletin | volume = 51 | issue = 21| pages = 2634–2644 | doi = 10.1007/s11434-006-2165-2 | bibcode = 2006ChSBu..51.2634L }}&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent study, published in 2008, refined the age range of the formation further, finding that the lower boundary of the Tiaojishan was formed 165 Ma ago, and the upper boundary somewhere between 156-153 Ma ago.&lt;ref name="zhangetal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = H. | last2 = Wang | first2 = M. | last3 = Liu | first3 = X. | year = 2008 | title = Constraints on the upper boundary age of the Tiaojishan Formation volcanic rocks in West Liaoning-North Hebei by LA-ICP-MS dating | url = | journal = Chinese Science Bulletin | volume = 53 | issue = 22| pages = 3574–3584 | doi = 10.1007/s11434-008-0287-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daohugou bed===
The age of the Daohugou bed has been debated, and a number of studies, using different methodologies, have reached conflicting conclusions. Various papers have placed the fossils here as being anywhere from the [[Middle Jurassic]] period (169 million years ago) to the [[Early Cretaceous]] period (122 ma).&lt;ref name="ren2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ren | first1 = D. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = On the biostratigraphy of the Jurassic fossil beds at Daohugou near Ningcheng, Inner Mongolia | url = | journal = Geol. Bull. China | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 584–591 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first studies on the age of the Daohugou beds, published in 2004 by He ''et al.'', found them to be Early Cretaceous, only a few million years older than the overlying Jehol beds of the [[Yixian Formation]].&lt;ref name="he2004"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = He | first1 = H. | last2 = Wang | first2 = X. | last3 = Zhou | first3 = Z. | last4 = Zhu | first4 = R. | last5 = Jin | first5 = F. | last6 = Wang | first6 = F. | last7 = Ding | first7 = X. | last8 = Boven | first8 = A. | year = 2004 | title = (^40)Ar/(^39)Ar dating of ignimbrite from Inner Mongolia, northeastern China, indicates a post-Middle Jurassic age for the overlying Daohugou Beds | url = | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 31 | issue = | page = L20609 | doi=10.1029/2004gl020792 | bibcode=2004GeoRL..3120609H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 study primarily used [[Argon–argon dating]] of a [[tuff]] within the Daohugou Beds to determine its age.

However, subsequent studies cast doubt on this relatively recent age. In a 2006 study, Gao &amp; Ren criticized He ''et al.'' for not including enough specifics and detail in their paper, and also took issue with their radiometric dating of the Daohugou tuff. The tuff, Gao and Ren argued, contains crystals with a variety of diverse radiometric ages, some up to a billion years old, so using dates from only a few of these crystals could not determine the overall age of the deposits. Gao and Ren went on to defend a Middle Jurassic age for the beds based on [[biostratigraphy]] (the use of [[index fossil]]s), and the bed's relationship to a layer that is known to mark the Middle Jurassic-Late Jurassic boundary.&lt;ref name="gao2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = K. | last2 = Ren | first2 = D. | year = 2006 | title = Radiometric dating of ignimbrite from Inner Mongolia provides no indication of a post-Middle Jurassic age for the Daohugou Beds | url = | journal = Acta Geologica Sinica English Edition | volume = 80 | issue = 1| pages = 42–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-6724.2006.tb00793.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, published in 2006 by Wang ''et al.'', argued that the 159-164 million years old Tiaojishan Formation underlies, rather than overlies, the Daohugou Beds. Unlike the earlier study by Gao and Ren, Wang ''et al.'' found an overall similarity between the fossil animals found in the Daohugou Beds and those from the [[Yixian Formation]]. The authors stated that
&lt;blockquote&gt;"vertebrate fossils such as ''Liaoxitriton'', ''[[Jeholopterus]]'' and feathered [[maniraptor]]ans show much resemblance to those of the Yixian Formation. In other words, despite the absence of ''Lycoptera'', a typical fish of the Jehol Biota, the Daohugou vertebrate assemblage is closer to that of the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota than to any other biota."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wang ''et al.'' concluded that the Daohugou probably represents the earliest evolutionary stages of the [[Jehol Biota]], and that it "belongs to the same cycle of volcanism and sedimentation as the Yixian Formation of the Jehol Group."&lt;ref name= "Wangetal06"/&gt; However, a later study by Ji ''et al.'' argued that the key indicator of the Jehol biota are the index fossils ''[[Peipiaosteus]]'' and ''Lycoptera''. Under this definition, the earliest evolutionary stage of the Jehol Biota is represented by the [[Huajiying Formation]], and the Daohugou Formation is excluded due to the absence of ''Lycoptera'' fossils.&lt;ref name=jinetal2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jin | first1 = F. | last2 = Zhang | first2 = F.C. | last3 = Li | first3 = Z.H. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = J.Y. | last5 = Li | first5 = C. | last6 = Zhou | first6 = Z.H. | year = 2008 | title = On the horizon of ''Protopteryx'' and the early vertebrate fossil assemblages of the Jehol Biota | url = | journal = Chinese Science Bulletin | volume = 53 | issue = 18| pages = 2820–2827 | doi=10.1007/s11434-008-0209-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Later in 2006, Liu ''et al.'' published their own study of the age of the Daohugou beds, this time using Zircon [[Uranium-lead dating]] on the volcanic rocks overlying and underlying salamander-bearing layers (salamanders are often used as index fossils). Liu ''et al.'' found that the beds formed between 164-158 million years ago, in the Middle to Late Jurassic.&lt;ref name="Liuetal2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="liuetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liu | first1 = Y. | last2 = Liu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Zhang | first3 = H. | year = 2006 | title = LA-ICPMS zircon U-Pb dating in the Jurassic Daohugou Beds and correlative strata in Ningcheng of Inner Mongolia | url = | journal = Acta Geologica Sinica (English Edition) | volume = 80 | issue = 5| pages = 733–742 | doi=10.1111/j.1755-6724.2006.tb00296.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study by Gao and Shubin agreed with this assessment, and reported an Argon–argon date of 164 plus or minus 4 million years ago for the Daohugou horizon.&lt;ref name=gao&amp;shubin2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = K. -Q. | last2 = Shubin | first2 = N. H. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1009828109 | title = Late Jurassic salamandroid from western Liaoning, China | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 15 | pages = 5767–72 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22411790| pmc = 3326464|bibcode = 2012PNAS..109.5767G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Based on the plant life present in the Tiaojishan Formation, Wang Yongdong and colleagues determined that the climate in Liaoning during the mid Jurassic would have been [[Subtropics|subtropical]] to [[Temperateness|temperate]], warm and [[Humidity|humid]].&lt;ref name="wangetal2006"/&gt;

==Fauna==
Beautifully preserved fossils of [[dinosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s&lt;ref&gt;Notably ''[[Mongolarachne|Mongolarachne jurassica]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[invertebrate]]s, [[conifer]]s, [[ginkgo]]es, [[cycad]]s, [[horsetail]]s, and [[fern]]s, and even the earliest known gliding mammal (''[[Volaticotherium]]'') and an aquatic protomammal (''[[Castorocauda]]'') have been discovered in these rocks. These organisms were part of the '''Daohugou Biota''', which formed the local ecosystem of that Jurassic time. The tuffaceous composition of some rock layers show that this was a volcanic area, occasionally experiencing heavy ashfalls from eruptions. The landscape then was dominated by mountain streams and deep lakes surrounded by forests of [[gymnosperm]] trees.&lt;ref name="Tanetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tan | first1 = Jingjing | last2 = Ren | first2 = Dong | last3 = Shih | first3 = Chungkun | year = 2006 | title = New Cupedids from the Middle Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, China (Coleoptera: Archostemata) | url = | journal = Annales Zoologici | volume = 56 | issue = 1| pages = 1–6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors{{who|date=December 2013}} have concluded that the Daohugou Biota is an early stage of the [[Jehol Biota]], while recent work{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} has demonstrated that the two are distinct.

The forests of the Daohugou biota grew in a humid, warm - temperate climate and were dominated by [[gymnosperm]] trees. There were [[ginkgo]]psids like ''Ginkoites'', ''[[Ginkgo]]'', ''Baiera'', ''Czekanowskia'', and ''Phoenicopsis''. There were also [[conifer]]s like ''Pityophyllum'', ''Rhipidiocladus'', ''Elatocladus'', ''Schizolepis'', and ''Podozamites''. Also, [[Lycopsid]]s like ''Lycopodites'' and ''Sellaginellities'', horsetails ([[Sphenopsida]]) like ''Equisetum'', [[cycads]] like ''Anomozamites'', and ferns ([[Filicopsida]]) like ''Todites'' and ''Coniopteris''.&lt;ref name="Zhangetal2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zhang | first1 = Kuiyan | last2 = Yang | first2 = Ding | last3 = Ren | first3 = Dong | year = 2006 | title = The first snipe fly (Diptera: Rhagionidae) from the Middle Jurassic of Inner Mongolia, China | url = | journal = Zootaxa | volume = 1134 | issue = | pages = 51–57 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Wukongopteridae|wukongopterid]] named after [[Charles Darwin]]. The type species, ''D. modularis'' was the first known pterosaur to display features of both long-tailed [[rhamphorhynchoid]]s and short-tailed [[pterodactyloid]]s, and was described as a transitional fossil between the two groups. ''Darwinopterus'' specimens have also been reported to show several differences between males and females, with the males having distinctive crests on their heads. They are known to have laid their eggs on the ground, and may have also not shown that much for parental care.

An [[Anchiornithidae|anchiornithid]] at first believed to be a [[troodont]]. Given the exquisite preservation of one of the first specimen's fossils, ''Anchiornis'' became the first dinosaur species for which almost the entire life coloration could be determined. Most of the body feathers of ''Anchiornis'' were gray and black. The crown of head feathers was mainly rufous with a gray base and front, and the face had rufous speckles among predominantly black head feathers. The wing and hind leg feathers were white with black tips. The coverts were gray, contrasting the mainly white main wings. The larger coverts of the wing were also white with gray or black tips, forming rows of darker dots along mid-wing. These took the form of dark stripes or even rows of dots on the outer wing (primary feather coverts) but a more uneven array of speckles on the inner wing (secondary coverts). The shanks of the legs were gray other than the long leg feathers, and the feet and toes were black. It was 34 centimeters (13 inches) and weighed only 110 grams (3.9 ounces).

An anchiornithid known from an adult specimen measuring 400 mm in body length. Its fossilized feathers possess nanostructures which were analyzed and interpreted as melanosomes, showing similarity to organelles that produce a black iridescent color in certain species of extant [[bird]]s. Other feathers found on the head, chest, and the base of the tail preserve flattened sheets of platelet-like melanosomes very similar in shape to those which create brightly colored iridescent hues in the feathers of modern [[hummingbirds]]. However, these structures are seemingly solid and lack air bubbles, and thus are internally more akin to the melanosomes in [[Trumpeter (bird)|trumpeters]] than hummingbirds. ''Caihong'' represents the oldest known evidence of platelet-like melanosomes. It is named for the large crest on the lacrimal bone of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;Dongyu Hu; Julia A. Clarke; Chad M.

A [[scansoriopterygid]] known from a well-preserved partial skeleton, measuring 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length (44.5 centimeters or 17.5 inches including the incomplete tail feathers), that includes four long feathers on the tail, composed of a central rachis and vanes. However, unlike in modern-style rectrices, the vanes were not branched into individual filaments but made up of a single ribbon-like sheet. ''Epidexipteryx'' also preserved a covering of simpler body feathers, composed of parallel barbs as in more primitive feathered dinosaurs. However, the body feathers of ''Epidexipteryx'' are unique in that some appear to arise from a "membranous structure" at the base of each feather. It has been suggested that this may represent a stage in the evolution of the feather. ''Epidexipteryx'' and its kin represent the earliest known examples of ornamental feathers in the fossil record.

One specimen
|
An anchiornithid that probably measured 1 meter (3 feet) or less in length, but since this species is only known from the hind legs, the actual length is difficult to estimate. Apart from having a very birdlike skeletal structure in its legs, ''Pedopenna'' was remarkable due to the presence of long pennaceous feathers on the metatarsus (foot). Some other [[paravian]]s are also known to have these 'hind wings', but those of ''Pedopenna'' differ from those of animals like ''[[Microraptor]]''. ''Pedopenna'' hind wings were smaller and more rounded in shape. The longest feathers were slightly shorter than the metatarsus, at about 55 mm (2 in) long. Additionally, the feathers of ''Pedopenna'' were symmetrical, unlike the asymmetrical feathers of some other non-avian paravians and birds. Since asymmetrical feathers are typical of animals adapted to flying, it is likely that ''Pedopenna'' represents an early stage in the development of these structures. While many of the feather impressions in the fossil are weak, it is clear that each possessed a rachis and barbs, and while the exact number of foot feathers is uncertain, they are more numerous than in the hind-wings of ''Microraptor''. ''Pedopenna'' also shows evidence of shorter feathers overlying the long foot feathers, evidence for the presence of coverts as seen in modern birds. Since the feathers show fewer aerodynamic adaptations than the similar hind wings of ''Microraptor'', and appear to be less stiff, suggests that if they did have some kind of aerodynamic function, it was much weaker than in other non-avian paravians and birds.

An anchiornithid with plumulaceous-like feathers. Feather imprints include wispy bundles along the neck, short and symmetrical vaned feathers on the arms, and both fuzz and long pennaceous feathers on its hind limbs (bearing a striking resemblance of the delicate hind limb filaments to the modern [[Silkie]] breed of [[domestic chicken]]. While its anatomy and integument share features with birds as well as derived [[dromaeosaurs]] such as ''Microraptor'', cladistic analysis places the genus within the cluster of feathered non-avian dinosaurs near the origin of avialans. It was unlikely to be a flier.

Lu et al., 2010, reported that these beds were actually part of the Tiaojishan Formation, dating from the Late Jurassic period. ''Tianyulong'' has a row of long, filamentous integumentary structures on the back, tail and neck of the specimen, similar to the feathers found in certain theropods (this suggests that all heterodontosaurs may have had these filaments). The holotype is from a subadult individual that probably measured 70 centimeters in length based on the proportions of the related [[Southern Africa]]n species ''[[Heterodontosaurus]]''.

A gliding scansoriopterygid, weighing about 380 grams (0.84 pounds), that, like other scansoriopterygids, possessed an unusual, elongated third finger, that (in the case of ''Yi'') helped to support a membranous gliding plane made of skin. The planes of ''Yi'' were also supported by a long, bony strut attached to the wrist. This modified wrist bone and membrane-based plane is unique among all known dinosaurs, and might have resulted in wings similar in appearance to those of [[bat]]s. This also leads to the hypothesis that the other two genera of scansoriopterygids also had gliding membranes, but this is yet to be proven official.

Furthermore, its discovery fills gaps in the fossil record and helps to calibrate modern, DNA-based methods of dating the evolution. Based on climbing adaptations found in the forelimb bones, it has been suggested that the basal stock of eutherians was arboreal.
