The '''A701''' is a major road in [[Scotland]] that runs from [[Dumfries]] to [[Edinburgh]].

==Route==

The A701 leaves Dumfries and travels north to meet the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M)]] east of [[Beattock]]. It then passes beneath the A74(M) before continuing to the north-east towards [[Moffat]] and ultimately Edinburgh.  

The road can be an alternative to the [[A7 road (Great Britain)|A7]] or [[A702 road (Great Britain)|A702]] routes to Edinburgh from the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|A74(M)]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]].  It is signposted as a scenic route to Edinburgh from the motorway. The A701 is popular with motorcyclists and passes close to the edge of the [[Devil's Beef Tub]]. It runs also parallel with the former [[Talla Railway]] for several miles.

A stretch of the A701, between [[Penicuik]] and Edinburgh has a proposed bypass to run alongside it. This has been contested for many years, as the bypass will form a bottle neck back into the current road, and also will cut through an important wildlife corridor, a woodland which is a SSSI ([[Site of Special Scientific Interest]]). There has been a protest site there, campaigning to stop this development since June 2002.

[[File:Nemo Aronax Atlantis.jpg|thumb|Professor Aronnax and [[Captain Nemo]] visit the remains of Atlantis in ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea|20,000 Leagues Under The Sea]]'']]

The mythical island of [[Atlantis]] has often been depicted in [[book]]s, [[television program|television shows]], [[film]]s and other creative works of popular culture.  
&lt;!-- Please only include works where the main storyline involves Atlantis. Do not list individual shows or characters who are from Atlantis.--&gt;

==Fiction==

===Start of genre fiction===
Before 1900 there was an overlap between verse epics dealing with the fall of Atlantis and novels with a pretension to fine writing which are now regarded as pioneering genre fiction. [[Jules Verne]]’s  ''[[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea|20,000 Leagues Under The Sea]]'' (1869/71) includes a visit to sunken Atlantis aboard Captain Nemo's submarine ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/20,000_Leagues_Under_the_Seas_%28Walter%29/Chapter_33 Ch.33, “A Lost Continent”]&lt;/ref&gt; In Elizabeth Birkmaier's ''Poseidon's Paradise: the Romance of Atlantis'' (San Francisco 1892), the island sinks following an earthquake.&lt;ref&gt;Available [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t8w951q8r;view=1up;seq=9 online]&lt;/ref&gt; [[C. J. Cutcliffe Hyne]] also depicted the end of Atlantis in his fantasy ''[[The Lost Continent: The Story of Atlantis]]'', first published in 1899. The main character there, the soldier-priest Deucalion, is unable to prevent the tragic decline of his continent under the rule of the evil queen Phorenice. And according to D. Bridgman-Metchim, the author of ''Atlantis, the Book of the Angels'' (London 1900), his account is an interpretation of the [[Book of Genesis]] which covers all the events which immediately preceded the [[Flood myth|Flood]], as recorded by one of the fallen angels.&lt;ref&gt;Available [https://archive.org/stream/atlantisbookofan00bridiala#page/n9/mode/2up online]&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1900===
(Alphabetical by author, then by title)
*In [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1971 novel ''The Dancer from Atlantis'', the Atlantis myth refers to the [[Minoan eruption|volcanic explosion of Thera]] which is considered to have destroyed [[Minoan civilization]]. Therefore, the dancer of the  title is in fact from Crete.
[[File:Fantastic 196108.jpg|thumb|right|Poul Anderson's novelette "Goodbye, Atlantis!" took the cover of the August 1961 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'']]
*In Anderson's 1961 novelette "Goodbye, Atlantis!" &lt;ref&gt;Published in the August 1961 issue of ''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; the sunken continent of Atlantis has undergone a radical [[social revolution]], with an ideology similar to [[Communism]]. As a last-ditch effort, the diehard remnants of the old regime invoke savage old gods, which the Atlanteans have forgotten for many centuries. The wakened vengeful deities have no interest in the Atlanteans' political and ideological struggles, and simply destroy the entire continent and everyone on it.   
* [[K. A. Applegate|K. A. Applegate's]] series of novels ''[[Animorphs]]'' featured one incident in which the small group pursue their alien enemies, the Yeerks, and inadvertently find a hostile civilization in a city at the bottom of the ocean. The civilisation, known as the Nartec, tell their own tale as to how they came to be under the sea, but although Marco jokingly suggests that the group have discovered Atlantis, the name never appears. After the Animorphs make their escape, the Nartec do not appear or are even mentioned in later novels, leaving their fate undetermined.
* Another series by [[K. A. Applegate]], "[[Everworld]]," depicts Atlantis as an underwater city in Everworld's oceans. The gods [[Poseidon]] and [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]]---who both seem to have their own underwater cities nearby---war over control of the city, but the politically savvy leader of the city, Jean-Claude LeMieux, manages to keep it independent.
* [[Alexander Beliaev]], famous Russian sci-fi writer, has depicted the last days of Atlantis in his novel "The Last Man From Atlantis", the highlight of the book being the love story of princess Sel and sculptor Adishirna.
* [[Pierre Benoit (novelist)|Pierre Benoit]]'s classic ''[[Atlantida (novel)|L'Atlantide]]'' (1919) was a variation on a theme introduced by [[Henry Rider Haggard]] in ''[[She (novel)|She]]'', and told the story of two French Officers who find the lost city of [[Atlantis]] in the midst of the [[Sahara]], and fall in love with its beautiful queen, Antinea. It was filmed several times.&lt;ref&gt;Hathi Trust [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc2.ark:/13960/t7gq6w99q;view=1up;seq=13 copy online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marion Zimmer Bradley|Marion Zimmer Bradley's]] ''[[The Fall of Atlantis]]''. Her [[Avalon Series]] tells the story of how the ancient [[druid]]s were descendants of the survivors of Atlantis who landed in Britain.
* [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s 1935 poem ''Questions From a Worker Who Reads'', written to emphasize the role played by the lower classes in history, includes the lines: ''"Even in fabled Atlantis, the night that the ocean engulfed it / The drowning still cried out for their slaves"'' ([https://www.marxists.org/subject/art/literature/brecht/]).
* In [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]]'s ''The Atlantic Abomination'', Atlantis was dominated by giant alien beings who had the mental power to control humans and make them into completely obedient slaves. The sinking of the continent broke their power and set the surviving humans free to eventually create the present civilization. But American researchers in the depth of the Atlantic inadvertently waken one of these beings from a long hibernation on the sea bottom - with highly unpleasant results...
* [[Fredric Brown]]'s short story "[[Letter to a Phoenix]]" mentions Atlantis as the most recent civilization of six that the immortal narrator has lived in.
* [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[Tarzan]] series features a [[lost city]] known as [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], said to be a colony of Atlantis.
* The book ''[[Romance of Atlantis]]'' by [[Taylor Caldwell]].
* In ''[[Pastwatch: The Redemption of Christopher Columbus]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]] Atlantis is given passing mention; it is revealed through a machine that can look into the past that Atlantis was a 'raft city' on the banks of the Red Sea, and was completely submerged when the water from the Mediterranean and Indian Oceans came over the natural dams.
* [[Lincoln Child]]'s novel ''[[Deep Storm]]'' features a supposed find of the site of sunken Atlantis. The reality is much more sinister.
* In [[Eoin Colfer]]'s ''[[Artemis Fowl (series)|Artemis Fowl]]'' series, Atlantis is a Lower Elements city populated by Atlanteans.
* In book three of [[Bruce Coville]]'s Alien Adventures series, ''[[The Search for Snout]]'', Rod Albright's Father is eventually revealed as an Atlantean starfarer, from 35,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.
* The book ''[[Atlantis Found]]'' by [[Clive Cussler]], inspired by the non-fiction, ''When the Sky Fell'' by Rand &amp; Rose Flem-Ath.
* [[Kara Dalkey#Water Trilogy|Kara Dalkey]]'s Water Trilogy is a blend of Atlantis and [[Arthurian]] legends.
* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143452/http://www.alyssaday.com/books.html Alyssa Day]'s Warriors of Poseidon series is a modern day twist combining Paranormal Romance novels and the myth of Atlantis.
* [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Maracot Deep]]'' describes the discovery of the sunken remains of Atlantis by a deep-sea diving expedition, who find that it is still inhabited by a high-technology society which has adapted to life underwater.

* [[Jane Gaskell#The Atlan Saga|Jane Gaskell]]'s ''Atlan Saga'' features the young Atlantean princess Cija, who considers the continent's vicious Emperor Zerd as "The most vile man alive" - and yet she must make him marry her, and duly does... 
* [[David Gemmell]]'s fantasy novels make use of story of Atlantis in the ''Jon Shannow'' series (''Wolf of Shadow'', ''The Last Guardian'' and ''Bloodstone'') and the ''Stones of Power'' series (''Ghost King'' and ''Last Sword of Power'').
* The book ''Atlantis'' by [[David Gibbins]].
* Intended to be the fifth book in its [[Godzilla]] [[novel]] series, ''Godzilla and the Lost Continent'' would have seen Godzilla encounter monsters on a landmass risen from the Pacific sea, rather than the Atlantic, which might have been Atlantis. However, the book was never published by [[Random House|Random House Publishing]], which had produced the previous four books, for reasons unknown.
* In the novel ''[[Raising Atlantis]]'' and its sequels ''[[The Atlantis Prophecy]]'' and ''[[The Atlantis Revelation]]'' by Thomas Greanias,  Atlantis is depicted as being buried beneath the ice of [[Antarctica]] suggesting a large climate shift took place and covered up the ancient city.
* In [[Traci Harding]]'s ''[[The Ancient Future Trilogy]]'' (Book 2 - ''[[An Echo in Time: Atlantis]]''), Tory Alexander travels back in time to visit the lost city paradise of Atlantis, and its superior civilization, where she is taught of the [[mind sciences]] and expands her psychic capabilities, and is inspired of a city plan which features in later books.
* [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s story [[Lost Legacy]] imagined Atlantis as a colony of [[Mu (lost continent)|Mu]]. In a war for independence both lands sank.
* In the short stories of [[Robert E. Howard]], the character [[Kull of Atlantis|Kull]] was an [[Thurian Age#Atlantis|Atlantean]] - this version of Atlantis being inhabited by Barbarian tribes - and eventually became King of the civilized Valusia. His more famous character [[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]] was descended from Kull's Atlanteans.
* [[John Jakes]]' novel [[Mention My Name in Atlantis]] takes a humorous and satirical look at the Atlantis myth, being narrated by an Atlantean con-man whose account is manifestly unreliable. 
* [[William Joyce (writer)|William Joyce]]'s ''Guardians of Childhood'' series mentions the wizard Ombric Shalazar as being the last survivor of Atlantis.
* In [[Sherrilyn Kenyon]]'s ''[[Dark-Hunter series]]'', the leader of the Dark-Hunters is an Atlantean god.

* [[Mercedes Lackey]]'s [[The Dragon Jousters series|Dragon Jousters series]] is loosely based on the myth of Atlantis, as well as on the predynastic period of [[Ancient Egypt]].
* In the ''[[Pendragon Cycle]]'' of [[Stephen R. Lawhead]] survivors of Atlantis settle in Britain.
* In [[C. S. Lewis|C. S. Lewis's]] ''[[The Magician's Nephew]]'', [[Digory Kirke]]'s uncle Andrew received a box with Atlantean symbols from his dying godmother that contained dust from another world that he used to make the magic rings that sent Digory and his friend [[Polly Plummer]] to the worlds of [[Charn]] and [[The Chronicles of Narnia|Narnia]].
* In [[C. S. Lewis|C.S. Lewis's]] ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', it is debated by two of the villains that the character of [[Merlin]] may be from Numinor or as it is more commonly known, Atlantis. Other characters in the book believe that Merlin was not himself from Atlantis/Numenor but was rather the last in a long-lasting magical tradition which was started by refugees from the sunken continent, who brought magical knowledge to prehistoric Britain.    
* [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s ''[[The Temple (Lovecraft short story)|The Temple]]'' tells the story of a German Naval submarine sinking to the bottom of the ocean after a [[World War I]] battle and ultimately settling on the lost city of Atlantis.
* The novel ''The Hunt For Atlantis'' by [[Andy McDermott]] revolves around the main character's searching for the last location of the survivors  of Atlantis using a recovered piece of Orichalcum.
* [[Walter Moers]]' book [[The 13½ Lives of Captain Bluebear]] bases several chapters in Atlantis, a megacity and capital of Zamonia. It is described as having every civilization in time occupying it, since sailors came here from every period and stay.

* [[E. Nesbit|Edith Nesbit's]] [[The Story of the Amulet]] contains a chapter describing the fall of Atlantis.
* Stories in [[Larry Niven]]'s ''[[The Magic Goes Away]]'' series often mention Atlantis or feature Atlantean characters. ''[[The Burning City]]'' (2000), a novel by Niven and [[Jerry Pournelle]] set in that same fictional universe, features an Atlantean wizard. Within the novel the wizard briefly tells the story of how waste and misuse of [[mana]], the scarce "magic energy" resource, had caused the sinking of Atlantis.
* David Maclean Parry's ''[[The Scarlet Empire]]'' (1906) is a political satire set in Atlantis.
* [[Stel Pavlou]] places Atlantis two miles under the ice in Antarctica in the adventure novel ''[[Decipher (novel)|Decipher]]'' (2001). He also suggests [[orichalcum]] was pure [[carbon nanotube|C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;]].
* [[Diana L. Paxson]] wrote ''[[Ancestors of Avalon]]'', a book linking Bradley's ''Fall of Atlantis'' with the rest of Avalon Series.
* [[Charles Portis]]'s comic novel ''Masters of Atlantis'' concerns the establishment, and problems thereafter, of a cult dedicated to exploring the secrets and wisdom of Atlantis, gleaned from a short text supposedly recovered from Atlantis.
* In [[Ayn Rand]]'s novel, ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', [[Dagny Taggart]] searches for a technologically advanced city many other characters refer to as Atlantis.
* In ''[[Mothstorm]]'', the final book of Philip Reeve's [[Larklight Trilogy]], it is claimed that Atlantis was a lost continent on which the Mercurians had a colony before they left the Solar System thousands of years ago.
* In A G Riddle's Origin series the Atlantians are a species of human on a separate planet. The 'city' of Atlantis is actually a crashed spaceship, with a larger ship on the moon. The human race has had its genetic evolution accelerated by these crashed Atlantians in their pursuit of science and military domination.
*In his [[Sigma Force]] novel ''The Bone Labyrinth'' (2015), [[James Rollins]] depicts an elaborately decorated and protected, hidden city of Atlantis, located in Ecuador, to which the maps and writings by [[Athanasius Kircher|Kircher]] and his followers lead the characters. A skirmish there, between the protagonists and antagonists, leads to the destruction of the city and its artifacts.

* The British science-fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' is renowned for presenting three different versions of Atlantis' ultimate fate:
** In the Patrick Troughton story ''[[The Underwater Menace]]'' (1967), the [[second Doctor]], [[Ben Jackson (Doctor Who)|Ben]], [[Polly (Doctor Who)|Polly]] and [[Jamie McCrimmon|Jamie]] discover on contemporary Earth that Atlantis still exists, near the Azores, and a reclusive scientist intends to raise it above the waves again.
** Atlantis had also been mentioned in the Jon Pertwee serial ''[[The Dæmons]]'' (1971), with the godlike being Azal citing its destruction as a warning of an experiment gone wrong. 
** The Jon Pertwee serial ''[[The Time Monster]]'' (1972) concerns the plans of renegade Time Lord [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] to control Kronos, an ancient and powerful being worshipped by the Ancient Greek-style Atlanteans, while the [[third Doctor]] and [[Jo Grant|Jo]] endeavour to stop him. Atlantis is located on [[Santorini]].
*** Some have argued that ''The Underwater Menace'' and ''The Time Monster'' depict the flooding and collapse, respectively, of different parts of Atlantis, not the destruction of the whole, so that all three accounts may fit into one coherent narrative. Alternatively, and since the geographical and temporal locations seem to be at odds, the name 'Atlantis' may be taken as a translation convention – via the [[Time Lord]] gift that always translates local languages for the Doctor and his companions (and viewers) – referring to different lost prehistoric civilisations. The novel ''[[The Quantum Archangel]]'' suggests that the Daemons gave the Kronos crystal to the Atlanteans as a test, which they failed.

Later Luke and Courtney go diving and find Atlantis during a massive undersea quake. Courtney is rescued but not before she sees Luke (and Flipper) swim into a cave filled with light. At the end of the episode, everybody gives up hope of finding Luke when suddenly Flipper leaps out of the water with another dolphin (who has designs on his side similar to Luke's amulet).

==Games==

===Role-playing games===
[[Atlantis]] has been used in a variety of role playing games.
* In the ''[[d20 Modern]] [[d20 Menace Manual|Menace Manual]]'', Atlantis was referenced as a large island in the Aegean Sea, which used to be a permanent base for a race called the Fraal (another name for [[grey alien|greys]]), in which Fraal and human society coexisted, but they retreated to the outer edges of the solar system when "some sort of accident" (sic) destroyed it, along with all traces of its inhabitants.
* The remnants of Atlantis sought refuge within the [[Hollow Earth]] in ''[[Hollow Earth Expedition]]'', although this society too has mysteriously disappeared, leaving behind vast ruins and strange, psychic crystal-powered artifacts.
* In White Wolf Studio's ''[[Mage: The Awakening]]'', Atlantis is depicted as the land where humankind first discovered magic, but it was destroyed during the Celestial War, wherein the Oracles and the Exarchs battled for control of reality.
* In [[Palladium Books]]' ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'', Atlantis is a large continent in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean that was tied to the magical energies of earth. As the magical energies of earth dissipated, the island disappeared into a dimensional limbo until the "Coming of the Rifts" caused a resurgence of magical energies on the planet. In the current Rifts timeline, the continent of Atlantis is ruled by extra-dimensional slave traders known as the Splugorth. The original human residents of Atlantis, known as ''True Atlanteans'', are masters of Stone and Tattoo magic, and have spread across the Megaverse.
* In [[C.J. Carella]]'s ''[[CJ Carella's WitchCraft|WitchCraft]]'' and ''[[Armageddon (role-playing game)|Armageddon]]'', Atlantis is one of the Elder Kingdoms destroyed by the Angels through a giant Flood, and the original home of the Immortals.

===Video games===
* In ''[[Atlantis no Nazo]]'', Atlantis is featured as the setting that is explored by the main character.
* In ''[[Assassin's Creed Odyssey]]'', Atlantis is a lost Isu City and explored by the protagonists to understand the origin of the Staff of [[Hermes]] and learn more about [[Pythagoras]] himself.
* In ''[[Age of Mythology]]'' the first few levels of the campaign are set in Atlantis. Arkantos, the main character throughout the campaign, is Atlantean, and the civilization worships [[Poseidon]] as its main god. The game also shows Atlantis' location to be off the coast of [[Portugal]]. At the end of the campaign, a great battle causes most of the island to be submerged.  * In ''[[Age of Mythology: The Titans]]'', the Atlanteans are one of the playable cultures. Unlike the other civilizations in the game, which were designed with a combination of mythology and history, the Atlanteans were purely fictional. The hero of the story, Kastor, is Atlantean. Atlantis is featured at the beginning and ending of the story line, when Kastor leads the remaining Atlanteans in re-building the civilization.
* The [[MMORPG]] game ''[[Atlantica Online]]'' feature protagonists that are descendants from the now-destroyed Atlantis kingdom. The players constantly fight to stop monsters enraged from the power of the ancient Atlantean stones.
* [[Imagic]] released ''[[Atlantis (video game)|Atlantis]]'' for the [[Atari 2600]] in 1982.
* The games ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Tales]]'', ''[[Beyond Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Atlantis III: The New World|Beyond Atlantis II]]'' involve the legend. Atlantis takes place on the actual fabled city, whereas the other two games are based on discovering things related to Atlantis. All three games were made by [[Cryo Interactive]].
* In the 2000 [[Nintendo 64]] game ''[[Banjo-Tooie]]'', there is a level called Jolly Roger's Lagoon. Most of the level takes place underwater, where you can see Atlantis. It has ancient submerged temples.
*In the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] game ''[[Chrono Trigger]]'' there exists an advanced civilization in 12000B.C. called the Kingdom of Zeal, which appears to be roughly based on Atlantis. Like Atlantis, Zeal is destroyed and falls into the depths of the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chronocompendium.com/Term/Zeal.html |title=Zeal // Chrono Compendium |publisher=Chrono Compendium.com |date=2009-01-09 |accessdate=2012-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[MMORPG]] game ''[[Dark Age of Camelot]]'' by [[Mythic Entertainment]] featured an expansion called [[Trials of Atlantis]], where players got a chance to fight numerous Atlantean creatures on the isles of Atlantis.
* In the 1995 [[Game Boy]] game ''[[Donkey Kong Land]]'', the second world is known as "Kremlantis". It has temples, underwater ruins, and coral reefs.
* The Atlanteans, though not actually present in the games, played a large role in the first two ''[[Ecco the Dolphin]]'' games (''Ecco the Dolphin'' and ''Ecco: The Tides of Time'') as the creators of the time machine and the Glyphs. They also created the teleport rings present in ''Ecco: The Tides of Time''.
* The [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]]/[[Sega Mega-CD]] game ''[[Eternal Champions]]'' features a green-skinned Atlantean named Trident. According to the story, Atlanteans were indeed a separate species of humanity, featuring fish-like characteristics. Trident was their champion. The Romans were said to be responsible for the fall of Atlantis, after they rigged a [[gladiator]]-esque battle between Trident and a Roman champion. Before Trident could strike the winning blow, a sneaking Roman pushed a pillar down, crushing Trident.
* The [[Nintendo]] video game, ''[[G.I. Joe: The Atlantis Factor]]'', takes place in Atlantis, which has resurfaced.
* The platform game, ''[[Glover (video game)|Glover]]'' features Atlantis as the theme for the first world, containing a mixture of Ancient Greece style architecture and an abundance of water.
* In the 2010 [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] game ''[[God of War: Ghost of Sparta]]'', Atlantis is a level in the game, both above and beneath the sea. The theory of the Thera eruption is used in the game. A lava-based Titan named Thera is trapped beneath the city of Atlantis. When the protagonist [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] encounters the Titan, she begs him to free her, or else both would be trapped there forever. Kratos frees Thera which causes a volcano to erupt, destroying and sinking the city of Atlantis. Kratos' battle with the legendary sea monster Scylla further destroyed the city.  Atlantis was originally going to be a level for the 2007 PS2 game ''[[God of War II]]'', but did not make it into the final game. In ''[[God of War III]]'', which takes place a while after ''Ghost of Sparta'' but was released before then, the god [[Poseidon]] says ''"Atlantis will be avenged!"'' during the boss fight with him.
* The hero of ''[[Hercules no Eikō IV: Kamigami kara no Okurimono]]'' is an Atlantean who manages to survive the destruction of Atlantis.

* In the ''Master of Atlantas'' expansion pack ''[[Master of Atlantis - Poseidon|Poseidon]]'' to ''[[Master of Olympus - Zeus]]'', Atlanteans become a new playable civilization in a series of campaigns based loosely on the original material. It also tackles many of the more dubious claims about Atlantis (e.g. Atlanteans being involved with the building of the pyramids of both Egypt and Mesoamerica), albeit all with a rather humorous take.
*''[[The Omega Stone]]'', the sequel to ''Riddle of the Sphinx'', climaxes at an Atlantean pyramid at [[Santorini]], and goes on to state that there were two Atlantis cities, one at Santorini, and the other at [[Bimini]]. The cataclysm caused by a comet fragment (the titular 'Omega Stone') impacting Atlanti-Santorini caused a malfunction in the laser beam constructed to destroy the comet fragment, and somehow led to the sinking of both cities (precisely how is not made clear). Furthermore, it states that the ancient [[Egyptians]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], the [[Easter Islanders]], the [[Cretans]] and the builders of [[Stonehenge]] were all different Atlantean tribes.
* In the 2004 [[Nintendo GameCube]] game, ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', the port city of Rougeport rests on the sunken ruins of a legendary civilization that was brought beneath the ocean in a great cataclysm, possibly a nod to Atlantis.
* In ''[[Puzzle Pirates]]'', Atlantis was added as a feature on September 4, 2007. It is part of the Sea Monster Hunts feature of the game.
* In the PC game ''[[Riddle of the Sphinx]],'' one of the keys used to open the door under the Sphinx depicts a symbol described by the game's inventory as 'Atlantean'.
* In the third ''[[Serious Sam]]'' game, the hero ends up in Atlantis where he battles hordes of monsters (including the inhabitants of Atlantis).
* In ''[[Universe at War: Earth Assault]]'', the Masari faction has a city-ship called the Atlatea. The Maseri went into statis they sank the ship under the water, which explains the legend of Atlantis.
* In the PC game ''[[Wizard101]],'' the underwater world of Celestia is partially based on the lore of Atlantis.
* In ''[[Skies of Arcadia]]'' there is a sunken continent named Soltis. In the original Japanese it is named Atlantia.
* In ''[[The Journeyman Project 3: Legacy of Time]]'', aliens destroyed the entire city to prevent another alien race from obtaining a secret artifact. Gage Blackwood then time travels to Atlantis one day before its destruction and travels around the city in order to locate the artifact.
* In ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' and ''[[Tomb Raider: Anniversary]]'', Atlantis is the root of the [[Inca]]n, [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilizations, ruled by Tihocan, Qualopec and the immortal antagonist [[Recurring characters in the Tomb Raider game series#Jacqueline Natla|Natla]], its disgraced ruler. It was buried under a mountain when Natla betrayed Qualopec and Tihocan and poisoned the powers of the Scion. So the cultures scattered to the four winds and left Atlantis forever. It was nearly raised again by Natla to bring about the seventh age, but [[Lara Croft]] managed to stop Natla and destroy Atlantis completely. The games feature a series of levels based in Atlantis.

An '''automotive navigation system''' is part of the [[automobile controls]] or a third party add-on used to find direction in an automobile. It typically uses a [[satellite navigation]] device to get its position data which is then correlated to a position on a road. When directions are needed routing can be calculated. On the fly traffic information can be used to adjust the route.

[[Dead reckoning]] using distance data from sensors attached to the [[Powertrain|drivetrain]], a [[Inertial guidance system#Vibrating gyros|gyroscope]] and an [[accelerometer]] can be used for greater reliability, as GPS signal loss and/or [[Multipath propagation|multipath]] can occur due to [[urban canyon]]s or [[tunnels]].

Mathematically, automotive navigation is based on the [[shortest path problem]], within [[graph theory]], which examines how to identify the path that best meets some criteria (shortest, cheapest, fastest, etc.) between two points in a large network.

==History==
Automotive navigation systems represent a convergence of a number of diverse technologies many of which have been available for many years, but were too costly or inaccessible. Limitations such as batteries, display, and processing power had to be overcome before the product became commercially viable.&lt;ref&gt;''Cartographies of Travel and Navigation'', James R. Akerman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4S-UaFxGVL8C&amp;pg=PA280&amp;dq=honda+electro+navigation&amp;sig=J6xeR0c5DYK0cRatgdExKClGTjw#PPA278,M1 p.277]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1961: [[Hidetsugu Yagi]] designed a wireless-based navigation system. This design was still primitive and intended for military-use. 
*1966: [[General Motors]] Research (GMR) was working on a non-satellite-based navigation and assistance system called DAIR (Driver Aid, Information &amp; Routing). After initial tests GM found that it was not a scalable or practical way to provide navigation assistance. Decades later, however, the concept would be reborn as [[OnStar]] (founded 1996).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpspower.net/gps-news/330038-evolution-car-navigation-technology-pictures.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*1973: Japan's [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI) and [[Fuji Heavy Industries]] sponsored CATC (Comprehensive Automobile Traffic Control), a Japanese research project on automobile navigation systems.&lt;ref name="akerman279"&gt;''Cartographies of Travel and Navigation'', James R. Akerman, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4S-UaFxGVL8C&amp;pg=PA279 p.279]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
[[File:1995 GPS System.jpg|right|thumb|A GPS system designed by [[Philips]] in a 1995 [[Opel Omega]] vehicle]]
The road database is a [[Vector Map|vector map]]. Street names or numbers and house numbers, as well as [[Point of interest|points of interest]] ([[waypoint]]s), are encoded as [[geographic coordinate]]s. This enables users to find a desired destination by street address or as geographic coordinates. (See [[map database management]].)

Map database formats are almost uniformly proprietary, with no industry standards for satellite navigation maps, although some companies are trying to address this with [[SDAL]] and [[Navigation Data Standard]] (NDS). Map data vendors such as [[Tele Atlas]] and [[Navteq]] create the base map in a GDF ([[Geographic Data Files]]) format, but each electronics manufacturer compiles it in an optimized, usually proprietary manner. GDF is not a CD standard for car navigation systems. GDF is used and converted onto the CD-ROM in the internal format of the navigation system. CDF (CARiN Database Format) is a proprietary navigation map format created by [[Philips]].

SDAL is a proprietary map format developed by [[Navteq]], which was released [[royalty free]] in the hope that it would become an industry standard for digital navigation maps, has not been very widely adopted by the industry. Vendors who used this format include:

* [[Microsoft]]
* [[Magellan Navigation|Magellan]]
* [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]]
* [[Panasonic]]
* [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]]
* InfoGation

===Navigation Data Standard (NDS) ===
The [[Navigation Data Standard]] (NDS) initiative, is an industry grouping of car manufacturers, navigation system suppliers and map data suppliers whose objective is the standardization of the data format used in car navigation systems, as well as allow a map update capability. The NDS effort began in 2004 and became a registered association in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nds-association.org/wp-content/uploads/02_NDS-20120919-Short_History_of_NDS.pdf|title=Short History of NDS|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Standardization would improve interoperability, specifically by allowing the same navigation maps to be used in navigation systems from 20 manufacturers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nds-association.org/partners/|title=NDS Partners, NDS Association|accessdate=2015-02-13|publisher=NDS Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213192303/http://www.nds-association.org/partners/|archivedate=2015-02-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies involved include [[BMW]], [[Volkswagen]], [[Daimler AG|Daimler]], [[Renault]], ADIT, [[Aisin AW]], [[Alpine Electronics]], [[Navigon]], Navis-AMS, [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[DENSO]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Harman International Industries]], [[Panasonic]], Preh Car Connect formerly [[TechniSat]], PTV, [[Continental AG]], [[Clarion (car audio)|Clarion]], [[Navteq]], [http://www.navinfo.com/en/index.aspx Navinfo], [[TomTom]] and [[Zenrin]].

====Media====
The road database may be stored in [[Read-only memory|solid state read-only memory (ROM)]], optical media ([[CD]] or [[DVD]]), solid state [[flash memory]], magnetic media ([[hard disk]]), or a combination. A common scheme is to have a [[base map]] permanently stored in ROM that can be augmented with detailed information for a region the user is interested in. A ROM is always programmed at the factory; the other media may be preprogrammed, [[download]]ed from a [[CD]] or [[DVD]] via a [[computer]] or [[wireless]] connection ([[bluetooth]], [[Wi-Fi]]), or directly used utilizing a [[card reader]].

Some navigation device makers provide free map updates for their customers. These updates are
often obtained from the vendor's website, which is accessed by connecting the navigation device to a PC.

===Real-time data===
{{Main|Integration of traffic data with navigation systems}}
Some systems can receive and display information on [[traffic congestion map|traffic congestion]] using either [[Traffic Message Channel|TMC]], [[Radio Data System|RDS]], or by GPRS/3G data transmission via mobile phones.

===Integration and other functions===
*The color [[LCD]] screens on some automotive navigation systems can also be used to display [[television]] broadcasts or [[DVD]] [[Film|movie]]s.
* A few systems integrate (or communicate) with [[mobile phone]]s for [[hands-free]] talking and [[SMS|SMS messaging]] (i.e., using [[Bluetooth]] or [[Wi-Fi]]).
* Automotive navigation systems can include [[personal information management]] for [[meeting]]s, which can be combined with a traffic and public transport information system.

===Original factory equipment===
Many vehicle manufacturers offer a [[GPS navigation device]] as an option in their vehicles. Customers whose vehicles did not ship with GPS can therefore purchase and [[retrofit]] the original factory-supplied GPS unit. In some cases this can be a straightforward "plug-and-play" installation if the required wiring harness is already present in the vehicle. However, with some manufacturers, new wiring is required, making the installation more complex.

The primary benefit of this approach is an integrated and factory-standard installation. Many original systems also contain a [[gyrocompass]] and/or an [[accelerometer]] and may accept input from the vehicle's [[wheel speed sensor|speed sensors]] and reverse gear engagement signal output, thereby allowing them to navigate via [[dead reckoning]] when a GPS signal is temporarily unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;''In-Car Positioning and Navigation Technologies—A Survey'', I. Skog, and P. Händel, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TITS.2008.2011712]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the costs can be considerably higher than other options.

===SMS===
Establishing [[points of interest]] in real-time and transmitting them via [[GSM]] cellular telephone networks using the [[SMS|Short Message Service]] ([[SMS]]) is referred to as Gps2sms. Some vehicles and vessels are equipped with hardware that is able to automatically send an [[SMS]] text message when a particular event happens, such as theft, [[anchor]] drift or breakdown. The receiving party (e.g., a [[tow truck]]) can store the [[waypoint]] in a computer system, draw a map indicating the location, or see it in an automotive navigation system.

'''Badwater Basin''' is an [[endorheic basin]] in [[Death Valley National Park]], [[Death Valley]], [[Inyo County, California]], noted as the lowest point in [[North America]], with a [[Altitude, height, and depth|depth]] of {{convert|282|ft|abbr=on}} below [[sea level]].&lt;ref name=NED/&gt;  [[Mount Whitney]], the highest point in the [[contiguous 48 states|contiguous 48 United States]], is only {{convert|84.6|mi|km|sigfig=3}} to the northwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/mb/audio/bickel/distance.html|title=Find Distance and Azimuths Between 2 Sets of Coordinates (Badwater 36-15-01-N, 116-49-33-W and Mount Whitney 36-34-43-N, 118-17-31-W) |publisher=Federal Communications Commission |accessdate=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site itself consists of a small [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]]-fed pool of "bad water" next to the road in a [[sink (geography)|sink]]; the accumulated [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of the surrounding basin make it undrinkable, thus giving it the name.  The pool does have [[fauna (animals)|animal]] and [[flora (plants)|plant life]], including [[Salicornia|pickleweed]], [[aquatic insect]]s, and the [[Badwater snail]].

Adjacent to the pool, where water is not always present at the surface, repeated freeze–thaw and evaporation cycles gradually push the thin salt crust into hexagonal honeycomb shapes.

The pool is not the lowest point of the basin: the lowest point (which is only slightly lower) is several miles to the west and varies in position, depending on rainfall and evaporation patterns.  The [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]] are hazardous to traverse (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), and so the sign marking the low point is at the pool instead.  The basin was considered the [[Extremes on Earth|lowest elevation in the Western Hemisphere]] until the discovery of [[Laguna del Carbón]] in [[Argentina]] at {{convert|−344|ft|abbr=on|0}}.

==Geography==
[[File:Badwater elevation sign.jpg|left|thumb|Badwater Basin elevation sign]]
[[File:Badwater Desolation.jpg|thumb|right|View of the Basins's [[Salt pan (geology)|salt flats]]]]
At Badwater Basin, significant rainstorms flood the valley bottom periodically, covering the [[Dry lake|salt pan]] with a thin sheet of standing water. Newly formed lakes do not last long though, because the {{convert|1.9|in|abbr=on}} of average rainfall is overwhelmed by a {{convert|150|in|abbr=on}} annual [[evaporation]] rate. This is the greatest evaporation potential in the United States, meaning that a {{convert|3.8|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} lake could dry up in a single year. When the basin is flooded, some of the salt is dissolved; it is redeposited as clean crystals when the water evaporates.&lt;ref name="USGS01"&gt;{{cite web | author=United States Geological Survey | title=Badwater | url=http://geology.wr.usgs.gov/parks/deva/ftbad2.html | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071224063142/http://geology.wr.usgs.gov/parks/deva/ftbad2.html | work=Death Valley Geology Field Trip | publisher=US Department of the Interior | date=January 13, 2004 | archivedate=December 24, 2007| accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The current best understanding of the area's geological history is that the entire region between the [[Colorado River]] in the east and [[Baja California]] in the southwest (and bordered by various uplifts and mountains around the west-northwest-northern perimeters) has seen numerous cycles since at least the start of the [[Pleistocene]] (and perhaps up to 3&amp;nbsp;[[Megaannum|Ma]]) of [[Pluvial lake|pluvial]] lakes of varying size&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Our Dynamic Desert|url = http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1007/climates.html|website = pubs.usgs.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a complex cycle mainly tied to changing climate patterns (particularly, glaciation during the numerous [[Timeline of glaciation#Land-based chronology of Quaternary glacial cycles|recent Ice Age cycles]]), but also influenced by the progressive depositing of [[alluvial plain]]s and [[River delta|deltas]] by the Colorado River (cf. [[Salton Sea]]),&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Salton Sea:  California’s Overlooked Treasure - Chapter 1|url = http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/salton/PeriscopeSaltonSeaCh1-4.html|website = www.sci.sdsu.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; alternating with periodic water body breakthroughs and rearrangements due to [[erosion]] and the proximity of the [[San Andreas Fault]]. This has resulted in a high number of evaporating and reforming [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] lakes throughout the [[Quaternary Period]] in the area, with an intertwined history of various larger bodies of water subsuming smaller ones during water table maxima and the subsequent splitting and disappearance thereof during the evaporative part of the cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/groundwater/bulletin118/basindescriptions/6-18.pdf|title=Death Valley Groundwater Basin|website=www.water.ca.gov|accessdate=2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although these local cycles are now somewhat modified by human presence,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; their legacy persists; despite appearances much to the contrary, Death Valley actually sits atop one of the largest [[aquifer]]s in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life in Death Valley ~ Little Fish, Big Splash {{!}} Nature {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/life-in-death-valley-little-fish-big-splash/5055/|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Death Valley Geology Field Trip: Shoreline Butte|url = http://www.nature.nps.gov/geology/usgsnps/deva/ftsho1.html|website = www.nature.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oasis near Death Valley fed by ancient aquifer under Nevada Test Site, study shows|url = http://news.byu.edu/archive10-jun-ashmeadows.aspx|website = news.byu.edu|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Quaternary's wetter spans, streams running from nearby mountains filled Death Valley, creating [[Lake Manly]], which during its greatest extents was approximately 80&amp;nbsp;mi (130&amp;nbsp;km) long and up to 600&amp;nbsp;ft (180 m) deep.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="stoffer"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Philip Stoffer | title=Changing Climates and Ancient Lakes | work=Desert Landforms and Surface Processes in the Mojave National Preserve and Vicinity | version=Open-File Report 2004-1007 | publisher=USGS, US Department of the Interior | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1007/climates.html | date=January 14, 2004 | accessdate=September 12, 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091023192229/http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1007/climates.html| archivedate= October 23, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous evaporation cycles and a lack of outflow caused an increasing [[Hypersaline lake|hypersalinity]], typical for endorheic bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Saline Lake Ecosystems of the World|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NOdvPFm6SyoC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 1986-04-30|isbn = 9789061935353|first = U. T.|last = Hammer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over time, this hypersalinization, combined with sporadic rainfall and occasional aquifer intrusion, has resulted in periods of "briny soup", or salty pools, on the lowest parts of Death Valley's floor. Salts (95% table salt – [[NaCl]]) began to crystallize, coating the surface with the thick crust, ranging from {{convert|3|to|60|in|cm|0|abbr=on}}, now observable at the basin floor.&lt;ref name="USGS01" /&gt;

'''Ballybeg''' is an [[anglicisation]] of the [[Irish language]] term, ''Baile Beag'', which means "Little Town". The Irish playwright [[Brian Friel]] has  set many of his works, such as ''[[Philadelphia Here I Come!]]'', ''[[Translations]]'' and ''[[Dancing at Lughnasa]]'', in the fictional [[County Donegal]] town of Ballybeg.&lt;ref name="times-friel-letters-exile"&gt;Nightingale, Benedict. [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/stage/theatre/article5774491.ece "Brian Friel's letters from an internal exile"]. ''The Times''. 23 February 2009. "Brian Friel's Ballybeg - originally known in Gaelic as baile beag or “small town” - has known troubles galore."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Kelly, Emer. [http://www.independent.ie/incoming/friels-deep-furrow-cuts-to-our-heart-1879651.html "Friel's deep furrow cuts to our heart"]. ''Sunday Independent''. 6 September 2009. "Ireland possesses the universal voice as far as Friel is concerned. He does not look beyond, and forges the steel of human experience in a place called Ballybeg."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winer, Linda.[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/43382752.html?dids=43382752:43382752&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+23%2C+1999&amp;author=Linda+Winer.+STAFF+WRITER&amp;pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&amp;desc=Three+Flavors+of+Emotion+in+Friel's+Old+Ballybeg&amp;pqatl=google "Three Flavors of Emotion in Friel's Old Ballybeg"].

"In the fictional town of Ballybeg in 1833, the British are remapping and renaming every hill and dale with English words, thus declaring ownership of the land while simultaneously treading on national pride."&lt;/ref&gt; Friel's Ballybeg has often been compared to the village of [[Glenties]], close to where he lived.
  
Ballybeg is also the name of many small [[townland]]s, towns and villages in [[Ireland]], including:

* [[Ballybeg, County Antrim|Ballybeg]], a townland in [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]]
* Ballybeg Road, a small road between Portglenone and Ahoghill in County Antrim, Northern Ireland

* Ballybeg, a village in [[County Wicklow]], Ireland
Many other places called Ballybeg are distributed around Ireland, and in Serbia there is a Ballybeg Mosque, built under the orders of Bali-beg Malkočević around 1521 [http://r-l-p.co.uk/+nis.html].&lt;ref&gt;Rich Past of Serbia's Southern Gateway, article in [[Belgrade]] Insight, (newspaper), 23 October 2015 with a photograph captioned "Ballybeg Mosque in Niš"&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish name|Scottish]], [[Polish name|Polish]], [[Czech name|Czech]] [[surname]].
{{TOC right}}

== Origins and variants ==
One theory relates the surname to a pet form of the [[Czech name|Czech]] and [[Slovak name|Slovak]] [[given name]] "Bartolomaeus" ("[[Bartholomew (name)|Bartholomew]]").

Another theory relates the surname to Barley Ton, inhabitants of various places called [[Barton (disambiguation)|Barton]] in [[England]]. However, another proposal would derive the name from [[Dunbarton]] in Scotland. The counties of [[Cheshire]], and [[Lancashire]] have the highest number of Barton families in the [[United Kingdom]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9844">'''Bone segment navigation''' is a surgical method used to find the anatomical position of displaced bone fragments in fractures, or to position surgically created fragments in craniofacial surgery.  Such fragments are later fixed in position by [[osteosynthesis]]. It has been developed for use in [[craniofacial]] and [[oral and maxillofacial surgery]].

After an accident or injury, a fracture can be produced and the resulting bony fragments can be displaced. In the oral and maxillofacial area, such a displacement could have a major effect both on facial aesthetics and organ function: a fracture occurring in a bone that delimits the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]] can lead to [[diplopia]]; a [[Human mandible|mandibula]]r fracture can induce significant modifications of the [[occlusion (dentistry)|dental occlusion]]; in the same manner, a skull ([[neurocranium]]) fracture can produce an increased [[intracranial pressure]].

== Surgical planning and surgical simulation ==

An [[osteotomy]] is a surgical intervention that consists of cutting through bone and repositioning the resulting fragments in the correct anatomical place. To insure optimal repositioning of the bony structures by [[osteotomy]], the intervention can be planned in advance and simulated.  The surgical simulation is a key factor in reducing the actual operating time. Often, during this kind of operation, the surgical access to the bone segments is very limited by the presence of the soft tissues: muscles, fat tissue and skin - thus, the correct anatomical repositioning is very difficult to assess, or even impossible. Preoperative planning and simulation on models of the bare bony structures can be done.  An alternate strategy is to plan the procedure entirely on a CT scan generated model and output the movement specifications purely numerically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutting|first=C|last2=Bookstein|first2=F|last3=Grayson|first3=B|last4=Fellingham|first4=L|last5=McCarthy|first5=J|date=1986|title=Three dimensional computer aided design of craniofacial surgical procedures: Optimization &amp; interaction with cephalometric and CT-based models.|url=|journal=Plast.

== Materials and devices needed for preoperative planning and simulation ==

The osteotomies performed in [[orthognathic surgery]] are classically planned on cast models of the tooth-bearing jaws, fixed in an [[articulator]]. For [[edentulous]] patients, the surgical planning may be made by using [[stereolithography|stereolithographic models]]. These tridimensional models are then cut along the planned osteothomy line, slid and fixed in the new position.
Since the 1990s, modern techniques of presurgical planning were developed – allowing the surgeon to plan and simulate the osteotomy in a virtual environment, based on a preoperative [[computed tomography|CT]] or [[MRI]]; this procedure reduces the costs and the duration of creating, positioning, cutting, repositioning and refixing the cast models for each patient.

== Transferring the preoperative planning to the operating theatre ==
[[Image:SSNSchema.jpg|thumb|130 px|left|Schematic representation of the principle of bone segment navigation; DRF1 and DRF2 = IR ]]
The usefulness of the preoperative planning, no matter how accurate, depends on the accuracy of the reproduction of the simulated [[osteotomy]] in the surgical field. The transfer of the planning was mainly based on the surgeon's visual skills. Different guiding headframes were further developed to mechanically guide bone fragment repositioning. {{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Such a headframe is attached to the patient's head, during CT or MRI, and surgery. There are certain difficulties in using this device. First, exact reproducibility of the headframe position on the patient's head is needed, both during CT or MRI registration, and during surgery. The headframe is relatively uncomfortable to wear, and very difficult or even impossible to use on small children, who can be uncooperative during medical procedures.  For this reason headframes have been abandoned in favor of frameless stereotaxy of the mobilized segments with respect to the skull base.  Intraoperative registration of the patient's anatomy with the computer model is done such that pre-CT placement of fiducial points is not necessary.

== Surgical Segment Navigator ==

Initial bone fragment positioning efforts using an electro-magnetic system were abandoned due to the need for an environment without ferrous metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cutting|first=C|last2=Grayson|first2=B|last3=Kim|first3=H|date=1990|title=Precision multi-segment bone positioning using computer aided methods in craniofacial surgical procedures.|url=|journal=Proc.

There are three or more IR transmitters are attached to the bones where the osteotomy and bone repositioning is about to be performed onto. The [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] position of each transmitter is measured by the IR camera, using the same principle as in [[satellite navigation]]. A computer workstation is constantly visualizing the actual position of the bone fragments, compared with the predetermined position, and also makes real-time spatial determinations of the free-moving bony segments resulting from the osteotomy.
Thus, fragments can be very accurately positioned into the target position, predetermined by surgical simulation.  More recently a similar system, the [[Surgical Segment Navigator]] (SSN), was developed in 1997 at the [[University of Regensburg| University of Regensburg, Germany]], with the support of the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss Company]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Marmulla R, Niederdellmann H: ''Computer-assisted Bone Segment Navigation'', J Craniomaxillofac Surg 26: 347-359, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clinical use of bone segment navigation ==

The first clinical report of the use of this type of system was by Watzinger et al. in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watzinger|first=F|last2=Wanschitz|first2=F|last3=Wagner|first3=A|display-authors=etal|date=1997|title=Computer-aided navigation in secondary reconstruction of post-traumatic deformities of the zygoma.|url=|journal=J Craniomaxillofac Surg.|volume=25|issue=4|pages=198–202|doi=10.1016/s1010-5182(97)80076-5|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the reposition of zygoma fractures using a mirrored image from the normal side as a target.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2966">'''Bucur''' is the legendary Romanian [[shepherd]] who is said to have founded [[Bucharest]], giving it his name. While the legend about the shepherd is probably apocryphal, the name of the city ({{lang-ro|București}}) is actually quite likely derived from a person named Bucur, as the suffix ''[[-ești]]'' is used for settlements derived from personal names, usually of the owner of the land or of the founder, though it is more likely that Bucur was the noble who owned the land.

[[Image:Biserica lui Bucur, 1856.jpg|thumb|300px|An 1856 painting of the Church of Bucur]]
There is an old small church named ''[[Biserica lui Bucur]]'' ("Bucur's Church") which, as the legend goes, was built by Bucur himself. However, this is not true, since the church appears to have been built at the beginning of the 18th century, and the oldest archeological remains found in the surrounding area were from the second half of the 16th century.&lt;ref name=Georgescu77&gt;Georgescu et al., p.76-77&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference to Bucur was written by the Franciscan monk [[Blasius Kleiner]], who claimed that Bucur was both a shepherd and a [[haiduc]]. Another early reference is found in ''An Account of the Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia'', an 1820 book published in London by the English consul in Bucharest, [[William Wilkinson (diplomat)|William Wilkinson]]. The earliest reference to Bucur's Church is from a geography manual written by [[Iosif Gentilie]] in 1835.&lt;ref name=Georgescu77/&gt;

As claimed by I. Fr. Sulzer in 1781, the name ''Bucur'' is probably related with Romanian ''bucurie'' ("joy"), ''bucuros'' ("joyful"), and ''a bucura'' ("to become joyful"), having a cognate in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], ''bukur'' ("beautiful"),&lt;ref&gt;Rosetti, II. p.110&lt;/ref&gt; and it is [[List of Romanian words of possible Dacian origin|believed to be of Dacian origin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion I. Russu, Limba traco-dacilor, 1967, Editura Ştiințifică&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various other etymologies given by early scholars for the city name, including the one of Ottoman traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]], who said Bucharest is named after a certain Ebu-Kariş, from the tribe of Beni-Kureiş, and that of an early 19th-century book published in Vienna, where it is assumed its name is derived from Bukovie, a beech forest.&lt;ref name=Georgescu77/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="916">The '''Presidente comunal''' ({{es icon}}) or Communal President ({{en icon}}) is the highest executive post for some locations in Argentina, mainly rural areas, called [[Commune (administrative division)|communes]]. It is equivalent to the title of [[Mayor]]. Some provinces with communes are [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Chubut Province|Chubut]], [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Tucumán Province|Tucumán]].

The term does not apply to other structures also known as communes, this generally referring to entities that are small in size. The top executive post in such areas is not designated President but as Mayor (maire in the French or Luxembourg communes).

The '''countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal''' include [[littoral]] and [[landlocked]] countries that depend on the [[Bay of Bengal]] for maritime usage. Historically, the Bay of Bengal has been a highway of transport, trade and cultural exchange between diverse peoples encompassing [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Today, the Bay of Bengal region is the convergence of two major geopolitical blocs- the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) and the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC). The [[Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multisectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation]] (BIMSTEC) promotes regional engagement in the area.

The Bay of Bengal countries are often categorized into a maritime [[subregion]]. The bay hosts vital shipping routes linking its littoral and landlocked hinterland with the [[Indian Ocean]]. Its sea bed is being explored and exploited for [[hydrocarbon]] reserves.

==Littoral countries==
*{{flag|Bangladesh}} The [[republic of Bangladesh]] is the [[List of countries by population|eighth-most populous country]] in the world. It is located at the northern apex of the Bay of Bengal, forming the largest and eastern part of the bay's historical namesake region, Bengal. It is hugely dependent on the bay for sources of nutrition (fish), shipping, energy and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hafez Ahmed |url=http://print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/more.php?news_id=123499&amp;date=2012-03-15 |title=BD wins maritime suit against Myanmar |website=Print.thefinancialexpress-bd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ravi Prasad, Special to Hart Energy |url=http://www.epmag.com/bangladesh-focuses-bay-bengal-762006 |title=Bangladesh Focuses On Bay Of Bengal &amp;#124; Exploration &amp; Production |publisher=Epmag.com |date=2014-11-19 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bangladeshi port of [[Chittagong]] is one of the busiest ports on the bay. The Bangladeshi capital [[Dhaka]] hosts the headquarters of [[BIMSTEC]]. 
*{{flag|India}} The [[India]]n states of [[West Bengal]], [[Odisha|Orissa]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] have coastlines on the Bay of Bengal. India's eastern military command is based in the port city of [[Kolkata]], a former Indian capital. Two of India's busiest ports [[Chennai]] and [[Vizag]] are also located on the bay. In addition to mainland India's coastline, the Indian union territory of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] is located on the bay. The islands are largely reserved as a base for the Indian military.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/andamans-strong-navy-army-base-developed-commercial-hub/1/955173.html |title=With strong navy and army base, 'Andamans should be developed as commercial hub' : FYI, News - India Today |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date=2017-05-16 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{flag|Indonesia}} The northern tip of the [[Indonesia]]n island of [[Sumatra]], including the province of [[Aceh]], forms the southeastern boundary of the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref name="britannica1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Verlaan |first=Philomene A. |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bay-of-Bengal |title=Bay of Bengal &amp;#124; bay, Indian Ocean |publisher=Britannica.com |date=1959-08-21 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*{{flag|Myanmar}} Formerly known as Burma, [[Myanmar]]'s entire coastline is located on the Bay of Bengal. Its largest city and commercial capital [[Yangon]] is located in the littoral [[Irrawaddy delta]] on the bay. Myanmar's [[Rakhine State]] forms a large part of the country's coastline. Rakhine State's provincial capital is the port city of [[Sittwe]].
*{{flag|Sri Lanka}} [[Dondra Head]] in southern [[Sri Lanka]] forms the southwestern boundary of the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; The coastline includes Sri Lanka's Eastern, Northern and Southern provinces. The Sri Lankan ports of [[Jaffna]], [[Trincomalee]] and [[Hambantota]] are located on the bay. Western Sri Lanka's [[Port of Colombo|Colombo port]] relies on the bay's transshipment traffic.
*{{flag|Thailand}} As a peripheral country,&lt;ref name="britannica1"/&gt; [[Thailand]]'s western coastline is linked with the Bay of Bengal through the [[Andaman Sea]], a marginal sea of the Indian Ocean.

==Landlocked countries and regions==
*{{flag|Bhutan}} The landlocked Himalayan kingdom of [[Bhutan]] is dependent on the Bay of Bengal as its sole maritime access route. Bhutan currently uses Indian and Bangladeshi seaports for maritime trade. Western Bhutan is dependent on the Indian port of Kolkata. Eastern Bhutan relies on the Bangladeshi port of Chittagong.
*{{flag|China}} The Bay of Bengal's coastline with Myanmar has been described as China's "second coast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idsa.in/idsacomments/ChinasSecondCoast_ngoswami_190614 |title=China’s Second Coast: Implications for Northeast India &amp;#124; Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses |publisher=Idsa.in |date=2014-06-19 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sino-Myanmar pipelines]] transport oil and natural gas from the deep-water port of [[Kyaukpyu]] to [[Yunnan Province]]. The [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] also forms part of the Bay of Bengal's landlocked hinterland
*{{flag|India}} Landlocked [[Northeast India]]'s only maritime passage depends on the Bay of Bengal, with [[Bangladesh]]'s Chittagong port being located closest to the region. The landlocked states include [[Assam]], [[Mizoram]], [[Tripura]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]], [[Nagaland]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]].   
*{{flag|Nepal}} The landlocked republic of [[Nepal]] forms part of the wider hinterland of the Bay of Bengal. Nepal has transit agreements with India and Bangladesh for use of seaports.

==Other dependent countries==
*{{flag|Maldives}} Although the Maldives is not located in the Bay of Bengal, its fishing industry depends on the bay. Fishing is one of the chief employment sectors in the Maldives. 
*{{flag|Malaysia}} [[Peninsular Malaysia]] is located near the Bay of Bengal. The Malaysian fishing and international trade sectors depend on the Bay of Bengal. 
*{{flag|Singapore}} [[Economy of Singapore|Singapore's economy]] relies significantly on container traffic from the littoral Bay of Bengal countries, which use the [[Port of Singapore]] for transshipment.

==Maritime history==
===Early history===
[[Prince Vijaya]], the first recorded king of Sri Lanka, traveled from ancient [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] (Bengal) through the Bay of Bengal to the island of Lanka and colonized it. Ancient [[Malay language|Malay]] chronicles record the sailor Buddha Gupta traveling from Bengal to the [[Malay Archipelago]] through the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref name="Suhrawardi2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ghulam M. Suhrawardi|title=Bangladesh Maritime History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-HgZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83|date=6 November 2015|publisher=FriesenPress|isbn=978-1-4602-7278-7|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ptolemy's map]] refers to the Bay of Bengal as the Gulf of the [[Ganges]].&lt;ref name="Suárez1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Suárez|title=Shedding the Veil: Mapping the European Discovery of America and the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XqjsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35|date=31 March 1992|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4505-79-6|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indianized kingdom|Hindu-Buddhist kingdom]]s in Southeast Asia depended on the Bay of Bengal for trade and cultural exchange. The South Indian [[Chola dynasty]] dominated the region in the 11th century, with records describing the Bay of Bengal as ''Chola's Lake''.&lt;ref name="KulkeKesavapany2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hermann Kulke|author2=K Kesavapany|author3=Vijay Sakhuja|title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&amp;pg=PA80|year=2009|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-230-937-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam in Southeast Asia]] also spread through the Bay of Bengal, by serving as a bridge between the Malay Archipelago and Indo-Islamic states in the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunil S. Amrith|title=Crossing the Bay of Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eWwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|date=7 October 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-72846-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert D. Kaplan |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/24/opinion/la-oe-kaplan-20101024 |title=Eastern Islam and the 'clash of civilizations' |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=2010-10-24 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 14th and 15th centuries, explorers like [[Ibn Battuta]] of Morocco, [[Niccolo De Conti]] of the [[Venetian Republic]] and [[Admiral Zheng He]] of [[Imperial China]] ventured through the Bay of Bengal. The [[Maldives]] depended on the Bay of Bengal for its huge shell currency trade.&lt;ref&gt;Boomgaard, P. (1 January 2008). "Linking Destinies: Trade, Towns and Kin in Asian History". BRILL – via Google Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, the [[Portuguese empire]] began traversing the sea routes of the Bay of Bengal. Portuguese maps referred to the bay as the "Gulf of Bengal".&lt;ref name="Amrith2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sunil S. Amrith|title=Crossing the Bay of Bengal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8eWwAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=7 October 2013|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-72846-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Taungoo Dynasty|Burmese Empires]] and the [[Kingdom of Mrauk U]] were major powers on the Bay of Bengal. The Kingdom of Mrauk U engaged in a naval war with the [[Mughal Empire]] of India in 1666. In the 18th century, numerous European trading companies established settlements across the region.

In the 19th century, the British government established direct crown rule in the Indian subcontinent; while the Dutch government established supremacy in the Indonesian archipelago. Colonialism disrupted and ended the region's traditional maritime networks.

===Modern era===
In the early 20th century, shipping between [[British India]] and [[British Burma]] rapidly increased. [[Rangoon]] became one of the world's busiest ports for immigrant arrivals, ranking alongside [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzBh71QMuqw |title=The Bay of Bengal: Rise and Decline of a South Asian Region |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rangoon, thousands of Indian migrants arrived to settle in British Burma. The migration fostered strong economic links between India and Burma. British Burma's petroleum industry supplied much of India's petroleum demand. However, commercial links were disrupted during [[World War II]], when Burma came under [[Japanese invasion of Burma|Japanese occupation]]. The Japanese took control of the Andaman Islands and used them as a penal colony. After the [[partition of India]] in 1947 and Burma's independence in 1948, there was a decline in Indo-Burmese commerce.

During the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] over [[Bangladesh Liberation War|Bangladesh's independence]], the Indian and Pakistani navies engaged in naval combat in the Bay of Bengal. A Pakistani submarine, the {{ship|PNS|Ghazi||6}}, sunk in the bay. In December 1971, the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] mobilized naval strike groups around the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;Rais, R.B (1987), The Indian Ocean and the Superpowers, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, {{ISBN|0-389-20695-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh and Myanmar engaged in a naval standoff over disputed maritime territory in 2008. The two countries settled their maritime boundary dispute in 2012 at the [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.itlos.org/fileadmin/itlos/documents/cases/case_no_16/C16_Judgment_14_03_2012_rev.pdf |format=PDF |title=INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE LAW OF THE SEA |date=2012 |website=Itlos.org |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, India and Bangladesh resolved their maritime boundary disputes at a UN tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/bangladesh-wins-maritime-dispute-with-india/article6191797.ece |title=Bangladesh wins maritime dispute with India |publisher=The Hindu |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2015 Rohingya refugee crisis|Rohingya refugee crisis]], caused by [[Persecution of Muslims in Myanmar|persecution in Myanmar's Rakhine State]], has been a major humanitarian and security challenge in the region.

==Demographics==
=== Population ===
According to Sunil S. Amrith, one in four people on earth live in the countries that border the Bay of Bengal. Its littoral areas — including coastal regions of eastern India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra — are home to over half a billion people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sunil S.

===Fishing===
Fisheries is an important economic activity in countries with coasts along the Bay of Bengal, particularly in Sri Lanka, India, Bangladesh,
Myanmar, Thailand and Indonesia. The fishing industry in the Bay of Bengal area provides employment and sustenance to large numbers of people. Based on a recent estimate, the total number employed on a full-time basis in fisheries in the area covered by the Bay of Bengal is 1.85 million. In
addition, a large number of people are engaged in fishing as a part-time activity. The total population in the households of those engaged in fishing, full-time or part-time, in this area, is estimated at around ten million.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/DOCREP/FAO/field/006/ad480e/ad480e01.pdf |title=Fisheries in the Bay of Bengal |website=FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department |access-date=1 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the fishing industry has developed into an important earner of foreign exchange through the export of marine and aquatic products. In Bangladesh fish exports account for 15 per cent of the total export earnings. Though the percentage contribution of the fisheries sector to total export earnings of the country is yet marginal in the other countries in absolute terms, the export earnings have been increasing very fast. As export items, fish and fish products are very important, as the net earnings from these products are extremely high, a result of their being almost one hundred per cent local resource-based.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The increased production of marine fish has come primarily through the motorization of traditional craft, the introduction of new craft and the introduction and popularization of new’ types of synthetic gear, which have replaced the traditional gear. It is in Thailand alone that the private/commercial sector has taken the initiative of introducing and extending craft and gear; there has been very little state support or intervention in these activities in this country.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; The increasing emphasis accorded to the development of coastal aquaculture is another feature common to almost every country in the region. In countries such as Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India, a primary reason for the increased emphasis on coastal aquaculture is the increase in foreign exchange earnings generated from shrimp farming.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Tourism===
Thailand's Andaman coast is the largest hub of tourism in the region. Sri Lanka's tourism industry has seen growth despite decades of civil war in the country's north. Bangladesh and India have significantly developed their domestic tourism industries, such as in [[Cox's Bazar]]. South India's renowned temple cities, such as [[Tanjore]], are located near the Bay of Bengal. In Bangladesh, the notable mosque city of [[Mosque City of Bagerhat|Bagerhat]] is located near the Bay of Bengal. Myanmar has prioritized tourism development, particularly in cultural heritage sites like [[Mrauk U]] and [[Bagan]].

===Transport===
The [[Port of Colombo]] in Sri Lanka handles over 5 million [[twenty-foot equivalent units]] (TEU)s of container traffic. The [[Port of Chittagong]] in Bangladesh handles over 2 million TEUs of container traffic. The [[Port of Chennai]] in India handles over 1 million TEUs of container traffic. Ports which handle over 100,000 TEUs of container traffic include the [[Port of Kolkata]], [[Tuticorin Port Trust]], the Port of [[Yangon]], [[Port of Mongla]] and Port of [[Vizag]]. Colombo is the busiest seaport in BIMSTEC. Chittagong is the busiest seaport on the Bay of Bengal coastline,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seanews.com.tr/chittagong-breaks-record-tops-2-million-teu-a-year-sooner-than-targeted/158288/ |title=Chittagong breaks record, tops 2 million TEU a year sooner than targeted - PORTS |publisher=SeaNews |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by Chennai, Kolkata, Tuticorin, Yangon, Visakhapatnam and Mongla.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=145881 |title=Chennai Port trust : performance during the year |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date=2016-04-16 |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kolkataporttrust1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kolkataporttrust.gov.in/showfile.php?layout=2&amp;lid=1714 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616194355/http://kolkataporttrust.gov.in/showfile.php?layout=2&amp;lid=1714 |archivedate=2017-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Visakhapatnam/vizag-port-poised-to-emerge-as-transhipment-hub/article8457021.ece |title=Vizag port poised to emerge as transhipment hub |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date=2016-04-10 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="worldbank1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/IS.SHP.GOOD.TU |title=Container port traffic (TEU: 20 foot equivalent units) &amp;#124; Data |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joc.com/port-news/asian-ports/bangladesh-port-expands-shippers-seek-chittagong-alternative_20170607.html |title=Bangladesh port expands as shippers avoid Chittagong |website=Joc.com |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sittwe Port]] and [[Hambantota]] are other important ports in the region.

===Common security space===
The [[BIMSTEC]] countries view the Bay of Bengal as a common security space. The first conference of national security chiefs in the region was held in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/post/86572 |title=Bimstec countries see Bay of Bengal as common security space |website=Theindependentbd.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-traditional security challenges===
The Bay of Bengal has non-traditional security challenges of [[piracy]], [[human trafficking]], terrorist networks and drug smuggling, which has led to greater cooperation between the navies of Bangladesh, India, the [[United States]] and Thailand.

===Sino-Indian rivalry===
The Bay of Bengal is a prime zone of strategic competition between two of Asia's largest countries- China and India. An example is in the case of Myanmar, where the [[Sino-Myanmar pipelines]] and Chinese-funded [[Kyaukpyu]] port project was followed by the [[Kaladan Multi-Modal Transit Transport Project]] funded by India. China and India have jostled for strategic influence in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal. The Sri Lankan port of [[Hambantota]] was built by the Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastwestcenter.org/events/the-rise-the-bengal-tigers-the-growing-strategic-importance-the-bay-bengal |title=The Rise of the Bengal Tigers: The Growing Strategic Importance of the Bay of Bengal &amp;#124; East-West Center |website=Eastwestcenter.org |date=2015-06-04 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Constantino Xavier |author2=David Brewster |author3=Anthony Bergin |author4=C.

===Japanese initiatives===
In 2014, Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzo Abe]] announced an initiative to develop an industrial corridor in Bangladesh to strengthen Japan's economic footprint in the region. The initiative is termed "Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt" (BIG-B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jica.go.jp/bangladesh/english/office/activities/initiative.html |title=The Initiative of BIG-B (The Bay of Bengal Industrial Growth Belt) &amp;#124; Bangladesh &amp;#124; Countries &amp; Regions |website=Jica.gp.jp |date=2014-06-16 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan is keen to establish a maritime surveillance center for the Indian Ocean region in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bdnews24.com/neighbours/2017/04/20/japan-keen-on-making-sri-lanka-a-centre-for-strategic-maritime-surveillance |title=Japan keen on making Sri Lanka a centre for strategic maritime surveillance |website=Bdnews24.com |date=2017-04-20 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval competition===
Bangladesh, Thailand and Myanmar depend on China as a source of military equipment. Some analysts have speculated of an arms race emerging between these countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aseantoday.com/2017/01/aseans-new-arms-race-nations-scramble-to-rearm-as-concerns-over-security-grow/ |title=ASEAN’s new arms race: nations scramble to rearm as concerns over security grow |website=Aseantoday.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saurav Jha |url=http://thediplomat.com/2016/12/the-bay-of-bengal-naval-arms-race/ |title=The Bay of Bengal Naval Arms Race |newspaper=[[The Diplomat]] |date=2014-04-23 |accessdate=2017-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint exercises===
The United States, a major Indo-Pacific naval power, conducts the [[Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training]] (CARAT) involving Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. In 2011, CARAT was held off the coast of southeastern Bangladesh. The [[Malabar (Naval Exercise)|Malabar naval exercise]] is held by the navies of the United States, India and [[Japan]].

===Natural disaster management===
The Bay of Bengal region has seen some of modern history's worst natural disasters, such as the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] and [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]. The international community often mobilizes naval forces to assist in relief operations in the aftermath of devastating natural disasters, with most recently being after [[Cyclone Sidr]] and [[Cyclone Nargis]].

'''[[Kosovo]]''' is a [[smallest countries|small]] and [[landlocked country|landlocked disputed territory]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. The country is strategically positioned in the center of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] enclosed by [[Montenegro]] to the west, Serbia to the north and east, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the southeast, and [[Albania]] to the southwest. It has no direct access to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] but its rivers flow into three seas, the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Black Sea]].
 
The country possesses impressive and contrasting [[landscape]]s determined by the [[climate]] along with the [[geology]] and [[hydrology]]. Both, the [[Albanian Alps]] and [[Sharr Mountains]], are the most defining feature of the country and simultaneously the most biodiverse regions of Kosovo. As far as the central region, the plains of [[Dukagjini Plain|Dukagjin]] and [[Kosovo field (Kosovo)|Kosovo]] stretches over the west and east, respectively.

The country is a quite rich country for its [[water source]]s, there are many long and short [[river]]s, as well as [[Artificial Lake|artificial]] and [[natural lake]]s around the country. Most of the rivers that rise in Kosovo have their mouths outside the country's territory in the Adriatic, Aegean and Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Gani Gashia, Florim Isufi, Shpejtim Bulliqia, Ibrahim Ramadania |title=Correlation between discharge, river Basin surface and rainfall quantity in Kosova |url=http://publisher-connector.core.ac.uk/resourcesync/data/elsevier/pdf/096/aHR0cDovL2FwaS5lbHNldmllci5jb20vY29udGVudC9hcnRpY2xlL3BpaS9zMTg3NzA0MjgxMTAxMjczMA%3D%3D.pdf |website=publisher-connector.core.ac.uk |pages=1–5 |language=English |format=PDF |quote=Kosovo waters flows towards the Adriatic, Aegean and Black Sea.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The longest river is the [[Drini i Bardhë]], while the shortest river is the [[Lumëbardhi i Prizrenit]].

The climate of the country is mostly defined by its geographical location in the southeastern part of the [[european continent]] and strongly influenced by the seas in the west, south and east. It enjoys a combination of a [[continental climate]] and a [[mediterranean climate]], with four distinct seasons.

Kosovo is characterised by rich [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and a wide array of [[ecosystem]]s and [[habitat]]s considering its relatively small area.&lt;ref name="biodiversity"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kosovo Biodiversity Assessment |url=https://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Kosovo-BiodiversityAssessment.pdf |website=ww.ammk-rks.net |pages=1–66 |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's [[biodiversity]] is conserved in two [[national park]]s and [[Protected areas of Kosovo|hundreds]] of other [[protected area]]s of different categories. The remote and [[Forests of Kosovo|forested]] regions are primarily inhabited by important species that are fast becoming rare in [[Southern Europe]], amongst them the [[brown bear]], [[grey wolf]], [[Balkan lynx|lynx]] and [[golden eagle]].

=== Borders ===

The [[landlocked country]] of [[Kosovo]] lies in the heart of the [[Balkan Peninsula]] in [[Southeastern Europe]]. It borders the countries of [[Montenegro]] to the west, Serbia to the north and east, the [[Republic of Macedonia]] to the southeast and [[Albania]] to the southwest.&lt;ref name="CIA"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/kv.html], CIA - The World Factbook&lt;/ref&gt; The land area of the country is {{convert|10,887|km2}}, being the [[List of countries and dependencies by area|161st]] largest country in the world.

The border between Kosovo and [[Albania]] stretches for a total of {{convert|113,551|km|abbr=on}} and is situated along the southwestern edge of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ministria e Punëve të Brendshme e Kosovës |title=STRATEGJIA KOMBËTARE E REPUBLIKËS SË KOSOVËS PËR MENAXHIMIN E INTEGRUAR TË KUFIRIT |url=http://www.kryeministri-ks.net/repository/docs/Strategjia_Kombetare_per_MIK_2013-2018.pdf |website=mpb-ks.org |pages=1–93 |language=Albanian |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This border is significantly marked by the [[Albanian Alps]], the [[Koritnik]] and [[Gjallica]] Mountains, which occupy the vast expanse of land between the countries. The border between Kosovo and the [[Republic of Macedonia]] stretches for a total of {{convert|170,772|km|abbr=on}}. This border is situated along the southeastern edge of the country, whereby the majority of this border follows the [[Sharr Mountains]]. The border between Kosovo and [[Montenegro]] measures at only {{convert|79,165|km|abbr=on}} in length, making it the shortest border in the country. This border is rugged and mountainous associated with the Albanian Alps. The border between Kosovo and Serbia stretches for a total of {{convert|380,068|km|abbr=on}} and is situated along the northern and eastern edge of the country.

The country of [[Kosovo]] features notable diversity with the [[landscape]] and [[relief]]. Framed along its borders by mountain ranges, as for instance the [[Albanian Alps]], and the [[Sharr Mountains]], the country's [[topography]] is clearly defined by two main plains, the plains of [[Dukagjini Plain|Dukagjini]] and [[Kosovo plain|Kosovo]].

Most of the country is mountainous and hilly. The southern and southeastern edge is distinguished by the Sharr Mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SHARR/ŠAR PLANINA – KORAB – DEŠAT/DESHAT |url=http://www.envsec.org/publications/Feasibility%20study%20on%20establishing%20a%20transboundary%20protected%20area.%20Sharr-Sar%20Planina-Korab-Desat-Deshat.pdf |website=envsec.org |pages=1–132 |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian Alps dominate the western edge as they offer the highest mountain of Kosovo, the [[Gjeravica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Zeqir Veselaj |title=Bjeshkët e Nemuna perla natyrore e Kosovës |url=http://documents.rec.org/publications/Bjeshket_e_Nemuna_AL.pdf |website=documents.rec.org |pages=29–32 |language=Albanian |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ministria e Mjedisit dhe Planifikimit Hapësinor - Instituti i Kosovës për Mbrojtjen e Natyrës |title=STUDIM MBI ARSYESHMËRINË E SHPALLJES SË TERRITORIT TË BJESHKËVE TË NEMUNA PARK NACIONAL |url=https://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Studimi_per_Bjeshket_e_Nemuna.pdf |website=ammk-rks.net |pages=13–14 |language=Albanian |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often referred to as the [[Bjeshkët e Nemuna]], the region is considered to be among the most inaccessible mountain range in [[Europe]] and the wildest range on the [[Balkan Peninsula]], which is best described in their name.

[[Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park]] and [[Sharr Mountains National Park]] were established to protect the landscape, scenery and natural environment of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PËR PARKUN KOMBËTAR "BJESHKËT E NEMUNA"|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Ligji_per_Parkun_Kombetar_-Bjeshket_e_Nemuna_Final.pdf|website=ammk-rks.net|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PËR PARKUN KOMBËTAR "SHARRI"|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Ligji_per_Parkun_Kombetar-Sharri__FINAL.pdf|website=ammk-rks.net|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent the most important regions of [[vegetation]] and [[biodiversity]] in the country, because they provide excellent conditions for a great [[wildlife|wild]] and [[plant]] life.&lt;ref name=Maxhuni&gt;{{cite web|title=Qenan Maxhuni: Biodiversiteti i Kosoves|url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Biodiversiteti_i_Kosoves.pdf|publisher=AKMM/IKMN|accessdate=23 February 2013|language=Albanian|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215939/http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Biodiversiteti_i_Kosoves.pdf|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VLERAT E TRASHËGIMISË NATYRORE TË KOSOVËS |url=http://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Vlerat_e_trashegimis_natyrore_te_Kosoves.pdf |website=ammk-rks.net |language=Albanian |format=PDF |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The [[Kopaonik|Kopaonik Mountains]] extend in the northern edge of the country and further run into central Serbia. They are characterized by its [[mineral]] wealth, especially abundant by [[lead]] and [[zinc]], making it one of the richest regions in [[Europe]]. This is due to the diversity of its [[geological|geological structure]], particularly with the new [[vulcanization]] during the [[Tertiary Period|tertiary period]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trepca.net/histori/020113-shala-bajgores-ne-veshtrimin-historik.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Show Caves of Yugoslavia"&gt;[http://www.showcaves.com/english/yu/showcaves/Mermerna.html Mermerna Pecina], Tony Oldham, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Better to See it Once"&gt;Around Kosovo:  It's Better to See it Once Than Hear About it 100 Times, Valerii Petrushka&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hydrography ===

[[File:Liqeni i madh ne bjeshket e Nemuna.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lake Leqinat|Lake of Leqinat]] within the [[Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park]] in the west of Kosovo.]]

A landlocked country, there are several notable [[river]]s and [[lake]]s within the country's borders. The [[drainage basin]] of the [[Black Sea]] comprises 50.7 percent of the territory of the country and totals {{convert|5520|sqkm}}, which makes it the largest in Kosovo.&lt;ref name="hydrography"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Ministria e Mjedisit dhe Planifikimit Hapësinor - Instituti i Kosovës për Mbrojtjen e Natyrës |title=Report The State of Water in Kosovo R |url=https://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/raporti_ujerave_2010-angl.pdf |website=ammk-rks.net |location=Prishtina |pages=31–39 |language=English |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main rivers in the section of the country of the river basin are the rivers of [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]] and [[Sitnica]].

In contrast, 43.5 percent of the country's territory is encompassed by the drainage basin of the [[Adriatic Sea]].&lt;ref name="hydrography"/&gt; The area includes the largest rivers flowing in the country, the [[White Drin]] with its tributaries [[Erenik]] and [[Dečani Bistrica|Lumëbardhi i Decanit]]. The rest belongs to the [[Aegean Sea]] drainage basin, where the largest river by far is the [[Lepenac]].&lt;ref name="hydrography"/&gt;

The [[Bifurcation of Nerodimka river|Nerodimka]] is of particular significance because it represents Europe's only instance of a river [[River bifurcation|bifurcation]] flowing into two seas, the Black and Aegean Sea. The bifurcation of the river is considered to be an artificial phenomenon, but created under extremely favorable natural conditions.
  
A number of natural lakes are located in the mountain ranges at various altitudes amongst them the [[Gjeravica Lake|Gjeravica]], [[Lake Leqinat|Leqinat]], [[Jazhincë Lake|Jazhincë]], and [[Zemra Lake|Zemra]]. Kosovo also does have a large number of [[karst springs]], [[Thermal water|thermal]] and mineral water springs.&lt;ref name="ICMMt"&gt;[http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/kosovo/hydrology.html] Independent Commission for Mines and Minerals of Kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;

The main lakes are [[Gazivoda Lake]] (380 million m³) in the north-western part, [[Radoniq lake]] (113 million m³) in the south-west part, [[Batlava Lake]] (40 million m³) and [[Badovc Lake]] (26 million m³) in the north-east part.  Other smaller scenic lakes include [[Zemra Lake]], [[Đeravica Lake]] and [[Liqenat Lake]].

Kosovo is characterised by a diverse [[biodiversity]] and an abundance of different [[ecosystem]]s and [[habitat]]s with a remarkable exponential value.&lt;ref name="biosection"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kosovo Biodiversity Assessment |url=https://www.ammk-rks.net/repository/docs/Kosovo-BiodiversityAssessment.pdf |website=ammk-rks.net |pages=1–66 |language=English |format=PDF |date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located at the crossroads of several [[biogeographical region]]s and therefore has specific [[climate]], [[geological]], [[hydrological]] and [[Geomorphology|morphological]] conditions.
 
In terms of [[phytogeography]], the land area of Kosovo lies within the [[Boreal Kingdom]], specifically within the [[Illyria]]n province of the [[Circumboreal Region]]. Its territory can be conventionally subdivided into four terrestrial [[ecoregion]]s of the [[Palearctic ecozone]], amongst them the [[Balkan mixed forests|Balkan]] and [[Dinaric Mountains mixed forests|Dinaric]] mixed forests.

Kosovo is particularly rich in remote and mountainous landscapes endowed with [[forest]]s. They are home to a large number of the country's [[animal]] species, including many [[endangered species]]. Kosovo is one of the rare countries in Europe with populations of rare species, the [[golden eagle]], the [[brown bear]], the [[grey wolf]] and the [[Balkan lynx|lynx]].&lt;ref name="biosection"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brown bear"&gt;{{cite web |title=Brown Bear Conservation Action Plan for Europe |url=http://www2.nina.no/lcie_new/pdf/634989771612454147_IUCN%20Euro%20bear%20action%20plans.pdf |website=nina.no |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grey wolf"&gt;{{cite web |title=Action Plan for Grey Wolf Canis lupus Conservation and Management |url=https://www.daba.gov.lv/upload/File/DOC_SAP/AP_grey_wolf_17_EN.pdf |website=daba.gov.lv |language=English |format=PDF |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lynx"&gt;{{cite web |title=STATSU AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE   BALKAN LYNX (Lynx lynx martinoi MIRIĆ, 1978) AND ITS PREY |url=http://www.catsg.org/fileadmin/filesharing/3.Conservation_Center/3.2._Status_Reports/Eurasian_lynx/Melovski_2012_Status_and_distribution_of_the_Balkan_lynx.pdf |website=catsg.org |language=English |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The country has only two designated [[national park]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview of Nature Protection Progress in Kosovo|url=http://www.landscapeonline.de/wp-content/uploads/DOI103097-LO201545.pdf|website=landscapeonline.de|page=6|language=Albanian|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bjeshkët e Nemuna National Park]] in western and southwestern Kosovo is the largest national park by area in the country. The park encompasses {{convert|63028|hectare|km2|}} of the mountainous region of the [[Albanian Alps]]. The [[Sharr Mountains National Park]] was established to protect the spectacular scenery of southeastern Kosovo. It includes the country's section of the [[Sharr Mountains]] that cuts across the landscape along the border between Kosovo and Macedonia.

Kosovo is located between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and mountainous regions of Southeast [[Europe]], on the [[Balkan Peninsula]]. This geographic location gives the country its large annual temperature range.  Summer temperature highs can reach +{{convert|30|°C|°F}}, winter's temperatures as low as {{convert|-10|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/kosovo/geography.html Geography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   According to the [[Strahler]] classification map the climate in Kosovo is considered moist continental.&lt;ref&gt;Strahler &amp; Strahler. (2006).Introducing Physical Geography, Boston:John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The country experiences warm summers and cold and snowy winters.

The climatic area of the [[Ibar (river)|Ibar]] valley is influenced by continental [[air mass]]es. For this reason, in this part of the region, the [[winter]]s are colder with medium temperatures above {{convert|-10|C|F}}, but sometimes down to {{convert|-26|C|F}}. The [[summer]]s are very hot with average temperatures of {{convert|20|C|F}}, sometimes up to {{convert|37|C|F}}. This area is characterized by a dry climate and a total annual precipitation of 600&amp;nbsp;mm per year, approximately. The climatic area of [[Metohija]], which includes the watershed of the [[White Drin]] river, is influenced very much by the hot air masses, which cross the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Medium temperatures during winter range from {{convert|0.5|C|F}} to sometimes {{convert|22.8|C|F}}. The average annual precipitation of this climatic area is about {{convert|700|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year. The winter is characterized by heavy [[snow]]falls. The climatic area of the [[mountain]]s and forest parts is characterised by a typical forest clime, that is associated with heavy [[rain]]falls ({{convert|900|to|1300|mm|in|abbr=on}} per year), and summers that are very short and cold, and winters that are cold and with a lot of [[snow]]. Finally, it can be stated that the Kosovo territory is characterised by a sunny climate with variable temperature and humidity conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/kosovo/climate.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527212027/http://www.kosovo-mining.org/kosovoweb/en/kosovo/climate.html |archivedate=2014-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9558">The '''geology of [[Estonia]]''' is the study of rocks, minerals, water, landforms and geologic history in Estonia. The crust is part of the East European Craton and formed beginning in the [[Paleoproterozoic]] nearly two billion years ago. Shallow marine environments predominated in Estonia, producing extensive natural resources from organic matter such as [[oil shale]] and [[phosphorite]]. The [[Mesozoic]] and much of the [[Cenozoic]] are not well-preserved in the rock record, although the glaciations during the [[Pleistocene]] buried deep valleys in sediment, rechanneled streams and left a landscape of extensive lakes and peat bogs. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=192-202}}&lt;/ref &gt;

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
[[File:Cambrian blue clay in Voka.jpg|thumb|Cambrian blue clay outcrop at beach of Gulf of Finland in Voka]]

Estonia is part of the [[East European Craton]], with an average continental crust thickness between 40 and 64 kilometers. The crust consolidated during the [[Svecofennian Orogeny]] in the late [[Paleoproterozoic]], nearly two billion years ago.
 
The contact between the crystalline basement and overlying rock dips gently to the south. Late [[Proterozoic]] and early and middle [[Paleozoic]] sedimentary rocks on the north coast of Estonia are 100 to 200 meters thick, reaching up to 500 to 800 meters thick in the Gulf of Riga and the southeast. The [[Baltic Syncline]] and [[Moscow Syncline]] are deeply buried structures within the Russian Platform, with three to five kilometers of sediments. They are linked by the [[Latvian Saddle]], which is shallower with two kilometers of sediment. Precambrian rocks do not outcrop anywhere in Estonia, but are present in the subsurface. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=194-196}}

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
Except for artificial outcrops in oil shale and phosphorite strip mines, the only outcrops of Paleozoic rocks are found in a few river valleys, coastal cliffs on the Baltic and the shores of lake Vortsjarv and Peipsi.
 
During the [[Ordovician]] and [[Silurian]], a shallow marine environment predominated in Estonia, depositing organic-rich black carbonate shale which later generated oil shale. Reef limestones and backreef [[dolomite]] contributed material to the carbonaceous shale. Silurian sedimentation took place during a retreat in sea levels, bringing a break in sediment deposition. 

In the [[Early Devonian]], sedimentation continued. The Old Red sandstones deposited in the [[Middle Devonian]] in a nearshore marine environment from sand and silt, shed during the [[Caledonian orogeny]] onto the Fennoscandian continental plain. A few carbonate rocks capped the Devonian in the southeast.

The sedimentary rocks preserve extensive fossils and tens of thousands of specimens have been gathered at the University of Tartu and Institute of Geology. [[Brachiopod]], mollusk, [[trilobite]], [[ostracod]], [[bryozoan]], [[graptolite]] and [[stromatoporoid]] fossils are especially common. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Loydell, Kaljo, Mannik |year=1998|title=Integrated biostratigraphy of the lower Silurian of the Ohesaare core, Saaremaa, Estonia|publisher=Geological Magazine|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/geological-magazine/article/integrated-biostratigraphy-of-the-lower-silurian-of-the-ohesaare-core-saaremaa-estonia/AE6BA198A1B3A22CEB12C2218A1D848F}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most natural resources in Estonia formed from fossil remains, including [[kukersite]] and phosphorite deposits formed from shells.

Through the Devonian, the continent [[Baltica]], which included Estonia, drifted from the South Pole to north of the Equator and was influenced by glacier-related changes in sea level. Deformation of rocks from weak, regional tectonic stresses leads to some [[anticline]] folds and fluid migration in the rocks, which generate [[metasomatic]] dolomite limestone, zinc mineralization and lead-sulfide deposits. The [[Kardla astrobleme]] on Hiiumaa Island formed from an asteroid impact 455 million years ago, and Estonia has three other small meteorite craters, less than 110 meters in diameters in the bedrock. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=194-197}}

===Mesozoic-Cenozoic (251 million years ago to present)===
The [[Mesozoic]] and much of the [[Cenozoic]] are poorly attested in Estonia. However, extensive sediments and landforms remain from the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]]. 

A thin blanket of Quaternary sediments covers the plains of western Estonia. The Baltic Sea and Gulf of Finland are relatively deep erosional features in the bedrock, as are the lake basins of Vortsjarv and Peipsi, which were deepened by glaciers during the [[Pleistocene]]. Before and in-between glaciations, a network of deep valleys formed, up to 145 meters below sea levels, connecting the Baltic and the Gulf of Finland. However, more recent sedimentation has disguised old valleys which do not appear as a major part of present day topography. 

Glacial debris is less than five kilometers thick in northern Estonia and parts of the country underlain by limestone and dolomite have [[karst]] processes and hardly any remnants of glaciation. The Haanja Heights and Otepaa Heights have up to 100 meters of glacial sediment, or up to 207 meters in the Abja Valley in the south. Quaternary geologists define five major till layers, separated by interglacial pollen assemblages.

Moraines are often up to tens of kilometers long and more than 50 meters in height, such as the Laane-Saaremaa terminal moraine. [[Kame]] fields and [[eskers]] are also common, particularly on the Pandivere Upland and the West Estonian Lowland. Glacial retreat began around 13,000 years ago and ended by around 11,000 years ago. However, ice-dammed lakes and isostatic rebound in the region played an important role in geomorphology for several more millennia. The Baltic Ice Lake gave way to the Yoldia Sea, Ancylus Lake and Littorina Sea, followed by the Limnea Sea. The land of Estonia rose 65 meters in a span of only 2450 years and has risen an additional 50 meters in the past 10,000 years. 

Deglaciation led to the formation of river valleys and 20 to 40 percent of downcutting in rivers in the south happened during a short span after glaciation. Estonia has 1500 lakes and 20,000 peat bogs, although the number of lakes was three times as many at the start of the [[Holocene]]. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=197-198}}

==Natural resource geology==
[[File:VKG Ojamaa kaevandus.jpg|thumb|VKG Ojamaa mine for oil shale extraction, using an Atlas Copco Scooptram ST7 underground loader]]
[[Oil shale in Estonia]] remains a major part of the economy and throughout the 1950s, '60s, '70s, '80s and early '90s, geologists extensively prospected oil shale resources, with peak production in 1980. [[Phosphorite]] mining was also an important activity in Estonia through the 1980s, prompting the so-called [[Phosphorite War]] in 1987 when the Estonian public opposed the expansion of mining efforts, and the implicit threat of additional Russian miners being sent to the region. The major phosphorite mine at Maardu closed in 1991 due to its environmental impact. 

[[File:Turbaraba.jpg|thumb|Peat extraction in Hiiumaa, September, 2013]]
Estonia has 165,000 mires (including 20,000 peat bogs), each with an area of one hectare or greater. About 1500 are commercially important and most have thicknesses of three to seven meters, with a maximum of 16.7 meters in the Haanja Heights.
Lake chalk is sometimes used to neutralize high acidity and for art material. Estonia also has iron ore in the crystalline basement, pyrite and [[glauconite]] and, as well as lead and zinc sulfide ore. Granite rock near Tallinn is often extracted for road work. 

Estonia also has extensive clays dating to the Cambrian, Devonian and Quaternary, which are widely used in ceramics and cement. Limestone is also used as a raw material for the chemical, pulp, paper, building stone and glass industries, while dolomite is sometimes used for facing stones. Gyttja lake mud occurs in 121 lakes, with up to three billion cubic meters of reserves and a large deposit of 45 million tons at Varska. Lake mud can be used for medical purposes, or in fertilizers. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=200-202}}

==History of geologic research==
Estonian geologists have developed The Book of Primeval Nature, chronicling landforms in the country. The Kaali meteorite crater on Saaremaa Island was the first geologic site slated for protection after its recognition in 1937. 

The Institute of Geology of the Academy of Sciences was organized in 1947, followed by the founding of the Geological Survey of Estonia and the Institute of Geology in 1957. Since the 1950s, Estonian organizations drilled tens of thousands of boreholes through the sedimentary cover, in some cases reaching more than 500 meters deep into the crystalline basement rock.
 
The Geological Survey of Estonia completed mapping of Paleozoic bedrock and Quaternary sediments by 1975. Additional maps of hydrogeology, geomorphology, engineering geology and even geoecology have been completed since then. Up until 1990, all geologic publications were written in Russian.

'''Herbert Ernest Gregory''' (1869–1952)&lt;ref&gt;[http://nwda.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv18865 Guide to the Herbert E. Gregory photograph collection 1900–1944]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Yale University]] [[geology|geologist]] well known for his early 20th-century explorations of the [[Colorado Plateau]] in [[Arizona]] and [[Utah]]. One of his most important works is ''Colorado Plateau Region'', published by the [[United States Geological Survey]] on the occasion of the [[United States]] sponsoring the 16th [[International Geological Congress]].&lt;ref name=Martin!983&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Geoffrey J.|title=Geography, Geographers and Yale University, c. 1770-1970|journal=Geography in New England Special Publication of the New England/St. Lawrence Valley Geographical Society|year=1983|pages=2–9|url=http://old.geog.psu.edu/hog/depthistory_files/Yale_Geog_in_NE.pdf|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory was a student at [[Harvard University]] of American [[geography|geographer]] [[William Morris Davis]]{{fact|date=May 2017}}. He was the director of the geology department at Yale University, where he worked to expand the department to include a human geography emphasis. From 1919 to 1936 he served as director of the [[Bishop Museum]] in [[Hawaii]], where, in 1961, after his death, he was honored by a medal named after him. The Herbert E. Gregory Medal is awarded every four years to a leading scientist in the Pacific Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 Herbert E. Gregory Medal |url=http://www.bishopmuseum.org/media/2011/pr11022.html |accessdate=19 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004042622/http://bishopmuseum.org/media/2011/pr11022.html |archivedate=4 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His seminal work included mapping much of the bedrock geology of the [[Colorado Plateau]], particularly in geologic monographs concentrating on what is now the [[Navajo Nation]] in northeastern [[Arizona]] and southeastern [[Utah]].  Among many other achievements, he was the first to name and describe the [[Upper Triassic]] [[Chinle Formation]], which is famous for preserving extensive fossil evidence of [[Late Triassic]] terrestrial ecosystems, including [[petrified wood|fossilized logs]].

In 1931, Gregory published the first [[geologic map]] of the [[Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument]].&lt;ref name="Science"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79476904.html|title=Utah's Fossil Trove Beckons, And Tests, Researchers|last=Stokstad|first=Erik|date=October 5, 2001|work=Science|accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gregory stated that no fossils had been discovered; however, many were later found.&lt;ref name="Science" /&gt;

==Mission==
'''[http://www.isric.org ISRIC - World Soil Information]''', legally registered as the International Soil Reference and Information Centre, is an independent, science-based foundation.
The institute was founded in 1966 following a recommendation of the International Society of Soil Science (ISSS, now [[International Union of Soil Sciences]]| (IUSS)) and the [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)]]. It has a mission to serve the international community with information about the world’s [[soil]] resources to help addressing major [[global issues]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|author-last1=IYPE|year=2005|title=Soil - Earth’s living skin, International Year of Planet Earth, Tronsheim (NO)|pages= 16| url=http://iuss.boku.ac.at/files/soilbrochureype.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main focus areas==
Together with partners, ISRIC produces, gathers, compiles and serves quality-assessed soil information at global, national and regional levels. Work is organised according to 4 workstreams: Setting Standards and References, Soil Information Brokering, Capacity Building and Advocacy, and Derived products.

'''Jean-Baptiste-Louis Franquelin''' was born at [[Palluau-sur-Indre|Saint-Michel de Villebernin]], [[France]] in 1650.&lt;ref name=born1650/&gt;  He died in France around 1712.   He was a [[Cartography|cartographer]], a royal [[Hydrography|hydrographer]], and a teacher of navigation. He was also the first official cartographer in Canada.

== Biography ==
Between 1674 and 1708, Franquelin drew around 50 detailed illustrated manuscript maps of [[New France]].  Franquelin came to Canada as a trader in 1671. [[New France]] Governor [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]] recognized his talents and recruited him to draw maps. He recorded the explorations of [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle|René-Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] between 1674 and 1684. The King appointed him royal hydrographer in 1688. He went to France in 1692 to complete a series of maps on the [[New England]] coast. He had 13 children, but unfortunately, his wife and ten of his children drowned in a shipwreck in 1693, near of [[Sept-Îles, Quebec|Sept-Iles]], Quebec.  He held his Canadian appointment from 1686 to 1697 and again from 1701 to 1703. However, from 1694 to 1707, he worked for [[Louis XIV]]th's military engineer [[Vauban]], and he never returned to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;C.E Heidenrich, ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', second edition, volume&amp;nbsp;II, Edmonton, Alberta: Hurtig Publishers, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;839&lt;/ref&gt;

{{for|the medieval Buddhist atomistic concept|Rupa-kalapa}}

'''Kalapa''', according to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] legend, is the capital city of the Kingdom of [[Shambhala]], where the [[Kings of Shambhala|Kulika]] King is said to reign on a lion throne. It is said to be an exceedingly beautiful city, with a sandalwood pleasure grove containing a huge three-dimensional [[Kalachakra]] [[mandala]] made by King [[Suchandra]].
	  
Kalapa Court, the palace of the king, stands on a platform of pearl in the centre.  The building is nine stories high.  The roof and floor of the king’s chamber consist of crystal plants that radiate heat for warmth. The city is shaped like a square, and surrounded by walls made of ruby.  There are four gates for entry made of precious stones. There are 31 pavilions each of which is surrounded by gardens and streams.&lt;ref&gt;The Kalapa Court of Shambhala(2016)  Douglas J. Penick, cited from  available at http://levekunst.com/the-kalapa-court-of-shambhala/&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two half-moon shaped lakes on two sides of Kalapa.&lt;ref&gt;Lepage Victoria(1996) Shambhala: The fascinating Truth Behind the Myth of Shangri-la.Theosophical Publishing House: Illinois.pp 30 &lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of countries with KFC franchises'''. 
As of year end 2014, there are 18,875 [[KFC]] outlets in 119 countries and territories across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Restaurant counts|url=http://www.yum.com/investors/restcounts.asp|publisher=Yum!|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated78&gt;http://www.yum.com/annualreport/pdf/2013yumAnnReport.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first KFC franchise opened in the United States in 1952, and in Canada a year later. The first overseas franchise was established in the United Kingdom in 1974. A large number of Caribbean and developed Western markets  entered by the early 1970s. This was followed by expansion throughout the Middle East and developed Asian markets from the mid-1970s and into the 1980s. China was entered in 1987. Expansions were made into most of Europe and South America in the early 1990s. The most recent area of expansion is Africa, where the company is targeting the continent's growing middle class.

The major markets for KFC include China (4,563 units), the United States (4,491 units), Japan (1,181 units), the United Kingdom (900 units), South Africa (736 units), Canada (663 units), Australia (618 units), Russia (608 units), Malaysia (579 units) and Thailand (531 units).

The global operations are overseen by Yum International, which is headquartered in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Yum! typically grant a master franchise to a local operator, or take a stake in a joint venture between such a company and itself. In 11 locations, Yum! International manages KFC directly, including China, Russia and India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xitem=84549&amp;CtNode=415&lt;/ref&gt; Worldwide, major franchise holders range from large local [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] such as [[Jardine Matheson]] and [[Doosan Group]], to companies specifically established to run restaurants franchises, such as [[AmRest]]. In Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia, the major franchise holders are [[publicly listed company|publicly listed companies]]. On the other hand, in smaller markets such as some Caribbean islands, the franchises may be operated by a single individual.

This is a list of '''[[municipal commissioner]]s for [[finance]]''' of [[Stockholm]] (''finansborgarråd''). In English, the title is often translated as Mayor of Stockholm, because the municipal commissioner for finance has become the top politician of Stockholm municipality since the Stockholm municipal reform 1940.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. [[:sv:Stockholms författningsreform 1940]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The office of municipal commissioner for finance was set up in 1920, replacing an older mayor's office. While the mayor (''borgmästare'') before 1920 was appointed by the government, the municipal commissioner for finance is elected by the Stockholm city council. After a reform in 1940, the municipal commissioner for finance is always representing the ruling political majority coalition in the city. From 1994 the municipal commissioner for finance is also chairman of the municipal council (''kommunstyrelsen''), a title often called mayor in English.

Based on early histories of South America and his own explorations of the [[Amazon River]] region, Fawcett theorized that a complex civilization once existed there, and that isolated ruins may have survived.&lt;ref name="Grann NYer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grann|first=David|author-link=David Grann|date=September 19, 2005|title=The Lost City of Z|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/09/19/the-lost-city-of-z|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|volume=LXXXI|issue=28|pages=56–81|issn=0028-792X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fawcett found a document known as {{Interlanguage link|Manuscript 512|pt|Manuscrito 512}}, held at the [[National Library of Brazil]], believed to have been written by Portuguese ''[[bandeirante]]'', João da Silva Guimarães. Da Silva wrote that during 1753, he had discovered the ruins of an ancient city that contained arches, a statue, and a temple with [[hieroglyphics]]. He described the city ruins in great detail without giving its location.

''Manuscript 512'' was written after explorations made in the [[sertão]] of the province of [[Bahia]].{{efn-lr|name="expl"|group="n"|See Fawcett's book ''Exploration Fawcett'' (1953).}} Fawcett intended to pursue finding this city as a secondary goal after "Z". He was preparing an expedition to find "Z" when [[World War I]] broke out and the British government suspended its support (Fawcett returned to Britain and served on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during the war). In 1920, Fawcett undertook a personal expedition to find the city, but withdrew after suffering a fever and having to shoot his pack animal.&lt;ref name="Grann NYer" /&gt; On a second expedition five years later, Fawcett, his son Jack, and Jack's friend Raleigh Rimell, disappeared in the Mato Grosso jungle.

==Possible influences on Fawcett==
Researchers believe that Fawcett may have been influenced in his thinking by information he might have obtained from indigenous people about the [[archaeological]] site of [[Kuhikugu]], near the headwaters of the [[Xingu River]].&lt;ref name="Grann book"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Grann|authorlink=David Grann|date=2009|isbn=978-0-385-51353-1|title=The Lost City of Z: A Tale of Deadly Obsession in the Amazon|publisher=Doubleday|year=|location=|pages=|title-link=The Lost City of Z (book)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuhikugu was discovered by Westerners after Fawcett's presumed death in the jungle in 1925. The site contains the ruins of an estimated twenty towns and villages in which as many as 50,000 people might once have lived.

== In popular culture ==
In 2005, the American journalist [[David Grann]] published an article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' on Fawcett's expeditions and findings, called "The Lost City of Z".&lt;ref name="Grann NYer" /&gt; In 2009, he developed it into a [[The Lost City of Z (book)|book of the same title]], and in 2016, it was adapted by writer-director [[James Gray (director)|James Gray]] into a [[The Lost City of Z (film)|film also of the same name]] starring [[Charlie Hunnam]], [[Robert Pattinson]], and [[Sienna Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/james-grays-the-lost-city-of-z-starts-shooting-marvels-spider-man-tom-holland-joins-the-cast-20150819|title=James Gray's 'The Lost City Of Z' Starts Shooting, Marvel's Spider-Man Tom Holland Joins The Cast|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|date=August 19, 2015|website=IndieWire|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2018 video game ''[[Shadow of the Tomb Raider]]'', [[Lara Croft]] uncovers relics of Fawcett's final doomed search of the Lost City considerably farther west in [[Peru]].

== Recent development ==
The discovery of large geometrical earthworks in interfluvial settings of southern Amazonia support Fawcett’s theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-03510-7|title=Pre-Columbian earth-builders settled along the entire southern rim of the Amazon|last=Jonas Gregorio de Souza et. al|date=March 27, 2018|website=Nature.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Moldova}}

'''Moldavia''' ({{lang-ro|Moldova}}, {{IPA-ro|molˈdova|pron|Ro-Moldova.ogg}} or {{lang|ro|Țara Moldovei}} (in [[Romanian Latin alphabet]]), {{lang|ro-Cyrl|Цара Мѡлдовєй}} (in old [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]]) is a [[historical region]] and former [[principality]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], corresponding to the territory between the [[Eastern Carpathians]] and the [[Dniester]] River. An initially independent and later autonomous state, it existed from the 14th century to 1859, when it united with [[Wallachia]] ({{lang|ro|Țara Românească}}) as the basis of the modern [[Romania]]n state; at various times, Moldavia included the regions of [[Bessarabia]] (with the [[Budjak]]), all of [[Bukovina]] and [[Hertza region|Hertza]]. The region of [[Pokuttya]] was also part of it for a period of time.

The [[Moldavia (region of Romania)|western half of Moldavia]] is now part of Romania, the eastern side belongs to the [[Moldova|Republic of Moldova]], and the [[Chernivtsi Oblast|northern]] and [[Budjak|southeastern]] parts are territories of Ukraine.

==Name and etymology==
{{Main article|Etymology of Moldova}}
The original and short-lived reference to the region was ''Bogdania'', after [[Bogdan I]], the founding figure of the principality. The names ''Moldavia'' and ''Moldova'' are derived from the name of the [[Moldova River]]; however, the etymology is not known and there are several variants:&lt;ref&gt;[http://rentmoldova.com/history-of-moldova/where-did-name-moldova.html Where did the name Moldova come from?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127183235/http://rentmoldova.com/history-of-moldova/where-did-name-moldova.html |date=2010-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fasttravel.ro/owerview.moldova.romania/en/ Etymology of Moldova] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919144321/http://www.fasttravel.ro/owerview.moldova.romania/en/ |date=2011-09-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a legend mentioned in ''[[:s:la:Descriptio Moldaviae|Descriptio Moldaviae]]'' by [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] links it to an [[aurochs]] hunting trip of the [[Maramureș region|Maramureș]] [[voivode]] [[Dragoș]] and the latter's chase of a star-marked bull. Dragoș was accompanied by his female hound called ''Molda''; when they reached the shores of an unfamiliar river, Molda caught up with the animal and was killed by it. The dog's name would have been given to the river and extended to the country.
* the old [[German language|German]] ''Molde'', meaning "[[Open-pit mining|open-pit mine]]"
* the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''Mulda'' (Gothic: 𐌼𐌿𐌻𐌳𐌰, Runic: ᛗᚢᛚᛞᚨ&lt;!--???--&gt;) meaning "dust", "dirt" (cognate with the English ''[[mould]]''), referring to the river.
* a [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] etymology (-''ova'' is a quite common Slavic suffix), marking the end of one Slavic genitive form, denoting ownership, chiefly of feminine nouns (i.e., "that of Molda").
* A landowner named Alexa Moldaowicz is mentioned in a 1334 document as a local [[boyar]] in service to [[Boleslaus George II of Halych|Yuriy II of Halych]]; this attests to the use of the name before the foundation of the Moldavian state and could be the source for the region's name.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] references to Moldavia included ''Boğdan Iflak'' (meaning "[[Bogdan#Rulers of Moldavia|Bogdan]]'s Wallachia") and ''Boğdan'' (and occasionally ''Kara-Boğdan'' &amp;ndash; "Black Bogdania").

===Early Middle Ages===
{{Main article|Origin of the Romanians|Romania in the Early Middle Ages}}

The inhabitants of Moldova were Christians. Archaeological works revealed the remains of a Christian necropolis at Mihălășeni, Botoșani county, from the 5th century. The place of worship, and the tombs had Christian characteristics. The place of worship had a rectangular form with sides of eight and seven meters. Similar necropolises and places of worship were found at Nicolina, in Iași&lt;ref&gt;Octavian-Liviu Șovan, Zorile creștinismului în nord-estul Moldovei-repere arheologice, Revista Forum cultural, Anul V, nr.4, decembrie 2005 (19)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bolokhoveni|Bolohoveni]], a [[Vlachs|Vlach population]], is mentioned by the Hypatian Chronicle in the 13th century. The chronicle shows that this land is bordered on the principalities of Halych, Volhynia and Kiev. Archaeological research also identified the location of 13th-century fortified settlements in this region. Alexandru V. Boldur identified Voscodavie, Voscodavti, Voloscovti, Volcovti, Volosovca and their other towns and villages between the middle course of the rivers Nistru/Dniester and Nipru/Dnieper.&lt;ref&gt;A.V. Boldur, Istoria Basarabiei, Editura V. Frunza, p 111-119&lt;/ref&gt; The Bolohoveni disappeared from chronicles after their defeat in 1257 by [[Daniel of Galicia]]'s troops.

In the early 13th century, the ''[[Brodnici|Brodniks]]'', a possible [[Slavs|Slavic]]&amp;ndash;[[Vlachs|Vlach]] [[vassal]] state of [[Halych-Volhynia|Halych]], were present, alongside the Vlachs, in much of the region's territory (towards 1216, the Brodniks are mentioned as in service of [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Suzdal]]).

On the border between Halych and the Brodniks, in the 11th century, a [[Viking]] by the name of Rodfos was killed in the area by Vlachs who supposedly betrayed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060616225750/http://www.vikingart.com/VArt/PS_Sjonhem.htm |archivedate=2006-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1164, the future [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine emperor]] [[Andronikos I Komnenos]], was taken prisoner by Vlach shepherds around the same region.

Later in the 14th century, King [[Charles I of Hungary]]  attempted to expand his realm and the influence of the [[Catholic Church]] eastwards after the fall of Cuman rule, and ordered a campaign under the command of [[Phynta de Mende]] (1324). In 1342 and 1345, the Hungarians were victorious in a battle against [[Tatars|Tatar-Mongols]]; the conflict was resolved by the death of [[Jani Beg]], in 1357. The Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]] mentioned Moldavians (under the name ''Wallachians'') as having joined a military expedition in 1342, under King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I]], against the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'', p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1353, [[Dragoș]], mentioned as a Vlach ''[[Knyaz]]'' in [[Maramureș]], was sent by [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis I]] to establish a line of defense against the [[Golden Horde]] forces of Mongols on the [[Siret River]]. This expedition resulted in a polity vassal to Hungary, centered around [[Baia]] (''Târgul Moldovei'' or ''Moldvabánya'').

[[Bogdan I of Moldavia|Bogdan of Cuhea]], another Vlach [[voivode]] from Maramureș who had fallen out with the Hungarian king, crossed the Carpathians in 1359, took control of Moldavia, and succeeded in removing Moldavia from Hungarian control. His realm extended north to the [[Cheremosh River]], while the southern part of Moldavia was still occupied by the Tatar Mongols.

After first residing in Baia, Bogdan moved Moldavia's seat to [[Siret]] (it was to remain there until [[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru Mușat]] moved it to [[Suceava]]; it was finally moved to [[Iași]] under [[Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] - in 1565). The area around Suceava, roughly correspondent to future [[Bukovina]], would later constitute one of the two administrative divisions of the new realm, under the name ''Țara de Sus'' (the "Upper Land"), whereas the rest, on both sides of the [[Prut]] river, formed ''Țara de Jos'' (the "Lower Land").

Disfavored by the brief union of [[History of Poland during the Piast dynasty|Angevin Poland]] and Hungary (the latter was still the country's overlord), Bogdan's successor [[Lațcu of Moldavia|Lațcu]] accepted [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] around 1370, but his gesture was to remain without consequences. Despite remaining officially [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and culturally connected with the [[Byzantine Empire]] after 1382, princes of the [[House of Bogdan-Mușat]] entered a conflict with the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Constantinople Patriarchy]] over control of appointments to the newly founded [[Metropolitan of Moldavia|Moldavian Metropolitan seat]]; [[Patriarch Antony IV of Constantinople|Patriarch Antony IV]] even cast an [[anathema]] over Moldavia after [[Roman I of Moldavia|Roman I]] expelled his appointee back to Byzantium. The crisis was finally settled in favor of the Moldavian princes under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]]. Nevertheless, religious policy remained complex: while conversions to faiths other than Orthodox were discouraged (and forbidden for princes), Moldavia included sizable Roman Catholic communities (Germans and [[Magyars]]), as well as [[Armenian Apostolic Church|non-Chalcedonic]] [[Armenians in Romania|Armenians]]; after 1460, the country welcomed [[Hussite]] refugees (founders of [[Ciuburciu]] and, probably, [[Huși]]).

The principality of Moldavia covered the entire geographic region of Moldavia. In various periods, various other territories were politically connected with the Moldavian principality. This is the case of the province of [[Pokuttya]], the fiefdoms of [[Cetatea de Baltă]] and [[Ciceu]] (both in [[Transylvania]]) or, at a later date, the territories between the Dniester and the Bug rivers.

[[Petru I of Moldavia|Petru I]] profited from the end of the Hungarian-Polish union and moved the country closer to the [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon realm]], becoming a [[Vassalage|vassal]] of [[Władysław II Jagiełło|Władysław II]] on September 26, 1387. This gesture was to have unexpected consequences: Petru supplied the Polish ruler with funds needed in the war against the [[Teutonic Knights]], and was granted control over [[Pokuttya]] until the debt was to be repaid; as this is not recorded to have been carried out, the region became disputed by the two states, until it was lost by Moldavia in the [[Battle of Obertyn]] (1531). Prince Petru also expanded his rule southwards to the [[Danube Delta]]. His brother Roman I conquered the Hungarian-ruled [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Cetatea Albă]] in 1392, giving Moldavia an outlet to the [[Black Sea]], before being toppled from the throne for supporting [[Fyodor Koriatovych]] in his conflict with [[Vytautas the Great]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]. Under [[Stephen I of Moldavia|Stephen I]], growing Polish influence was challenged by [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Hungary]], whose expedition was defeated at [[Ghindăoani]] in 1385; however, Stephen disappeared in mysterious circumstances.

Although [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander I]] was brought to the throne in 1400 by the Hungarians (with assistance from [[Mircea I of Wallachia]]), he shifted his allegiances towards Poland (notably engaging Moldavian forces on the Polish side in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] and the [[Siege of Marienburg (1410)|Siege of Marienburg]]), and placed his own choice of rulers in Wallachia. His reign was one of the most successful in Moldavia's history, but also saw the very first confrontation with the [[Ottoman Turks]] at Cetatea Albă in 1420, and later even a conflict with the Poles. A deep crisis was to follow Alexandru's long reign, with his successors battling each other in a succession of wars that divided the country until the murder of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]] and the ascension of [[Peter III Aaron]] in 1451. Nevertheless, Moldavia was subject to further Hungarian interventions after that moment, as [[Matthias Corvinus]] deposed Aron and backed [[Alexăndrel]] to the throne in [[Suceava]]. Petru Aron's rule also signified the beginning of Moldavia's [[Ottoman Empire]] allegiance, as the ruler agreed to pay [[tribute]] to Sultan [[Mehmed II]].

===Late Middle Ages===
{{Main article|Stephen the Great}}
{{See also|Moldavian–Ottoman Wars}}

Under [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], who took the throne and subsequently came to an agreement with [[Kazimierz IV Jagiellon|Kazimierz IV of Poland]] in 1457, the state reached its most glorious period. Stephen blocked Hungarian interventions in the [[Battle of Baia]], invaded Wallachia in 1471, and dealt with Ottoman reprisals in a major victory (the 1475 [[Battle of Vaslui]]); after feeling threatened by Polish ambitions, he also attacked [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and resisted Polish reprisals in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]] (1497). However, he had to surrender [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Chilia]] (Kiliya) and Cetatea Albă ([[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]]), the two main fortresses in the [[Budjak]], to the Ottomans in 1484, and in 1498 he had to accept Ottoman suzerainty, when he was forced to agree to continue paying tribute to Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. Following the taking of [[Khotyn|Hotin]] (Khotyn) and [[Pokuttya]], Stephen's rule also brought a brief extension of Moldavian rule into [[Transylvania]]: Cetatea de Baltă and [[Ciceu]] became his [[Fiefdom|fiefs]] in 1489.

[[File:Khotyn 3.jpg|thumb|[[Khotyn Fortress|Hotin Fortress]] on the [[Dniester]] River, present-day [[Ukraine]], then bordering the northern frontier of the Moldavian Principality]]

Under [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed]], Ottoman overlordship was confirmed in the shape that would rapidly evolve into control over Moldavia's affairs. [[Peter IV Rareș]], who reigned in the 1530s and 1540s, clashed with the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] over his ambitions in Transylvania (losing possessions in the region to [[George Martinuzzi]]), was defeated in Pokuttya by Poland, and failed in his attempt to extricate Moldavia from Ottoman rule – the country lost [[Bender, Moldova|Bender]] to the Ottomans, who included it in their [[Silistra Eyalet]].

A period of profound crisis followed. Moldavia stopped issuing its own coinage circa 1520, under [[Stephen IV of Moldavia|Prince Ștefăniță]], when it was confronted with rapid depletion of funds and rising demands from the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]]. Such problems became endemic when the country, brought into the [[Great Turkish War]], suffered the impact of the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]]; at one point, during the 1650s and 1660s, princes began relying on [[counterfeit]] coinage (usually copies of [[Swedish riksdaler]]s, as was that issued by [[Eustratie Dabija]]). The economic decline was accompanied by a failure to maintain state structures: the [[Feudalism|feudal]]-based [[Moldavian military forces]] were no longer convoked, and the few troops maintained by the rulers remained professional [[Mercenary|mercenaries]] such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.

[[File:Jassy (Iasi)-Trei Ierarhi Monastery (J.Rey, 1845).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] in Iași, housed the [[Vasilian College]], an institution of higher learning founded in 1640]]
[[File:Mihai 1600.png|thumb|left|In 1600, [[Michael the Brave]] became Prince of Wallachia, of Transylvania, and of Moldavia]]

However, Moldavia and the similarly affected Wallachia remained both important sources of income for the Ottoman Empire and relatively prosperous agricultural economies (especially as suppliers of grain and cattle – the latter was especially relevant in Moldavia, which remained an under-populated country of [[pasture]]s). In time, much of the resources were tied to the [[Economic history of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman economy]], either through [[Monopoly|monopolies]] on trade that were only lifted in 1829, after the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (which did not affect all domains directly), or through the raise in direct taxes - the one demanded by the Ottomans from the princes, as well as the ones demanded by the princes from the country's population. Taxes were directly proportional with Ottoman requests, but also with the growing importance of Ottoman appointment and sanctioning of princes in front of election by the [[boyar]]s and the boyar Council – ''[[Sfatul boieresc]]'' (drawing in a competition among pretenders, which also implied the intervention of creditors as suppliers of bribes). The fiscal system soon included taxes such as the ''[[Historical Romanian taxes|văcărit]]'' (a tax on head of cattle), first introduced by [[Iancu Sasul]] in the 1580s.

The economic opportunities offered brought about a significant influx of [[Greeks in Romania|Greek]] and [[Levant]]ine financiers and officials, who entered a stiff competition with the high boyars over appointments to the Court. As the [[Manorialism|manor system]] suffered the blows of economic crises, and in the absence of [[Salary|salarisation]] (which implied that persons in office could decide their own income), obtaining princely appointment became the major focus of a boyar's career. Such changes also implied the decline of free peasantry and the rise of [[serfdom]], as well as the rapid fall in the importance of low boyars (a traditional institution, the latter soon became marginal, and, in more successful instances, added to the population of towns); however, they also implied a rapid transition towards a [[monetary economy]], based on exchanges in foreign currency. Serfdom was doubled by the much less numerous slave population (''robi''), composed of migrant [[Roma in Romania|Roma]] and captured [[Nogais]].

[[File:Partitions of Moldavia.jpg|thumb|Moldavia through the ages]]

The conflict between princes and boyars was to become exceptionally violent – the latter group, who frequently appealed to the Ottoman court in order to have princes comply with its demands, was persecuted by rulers such as [[Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] and [[John III the Terrible|John III]]. Ioan Vodă's revolt against the Ottomans ended in his execution (1574). The country descended into political chaos, with frequent Ottoman and [[Tatars|Tatar]] incursions and pillages. The claims of Mușatins to the crown and the traditional system of succession were ended by scores of illegitimate reigns; one of the usurpers, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]], was a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Greek who encouraged the [[Renaissance]] and attempted to introduce [[Lutheranism]] to Moldavia.

In 1595, the rise of the [[Movilești]] boyars to the throne with [[Ieremia Movilă]] coincided with the start of frequent anti-Ottoman and anti-[[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] military expeditions of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] into Moldavian territory (see ''[[Moldavian Magnate Wars]]''), and rivalries between pretenders to the Moldavian throne encouraged by the three competing powers.

The Wallachian prince [[Michael the Brave]], after previously taking over [[Transylvania]], also deposed Prince Ieremia Movilă, in 1600, and managed to become the first Prince to rule over Moldavia, Wallachia, and Transylvania;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379802/Michael Michael the Brave] at [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="White2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=George W.

Polish incursions were dealt a blow by the Ottomans during the 1620 [[Battle of Cecora (1620)|Battle of Cecora]], which also saw an end to the reign of [[Gaspar Graziani]].

A period of relative peace followed during the more prosperous and prestigious rule of [[Vasile Lupu]]. He took the throne as a boyar appointee in 1637 and began battling his rival [[Gheorghe Ștefan]], as well as the Wallachian prince [[Matei Basarab]]. However, his invasion of Wallachia, with the backing of [[Cossack]] [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman]] [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], ended in disaster at the [[Battle of Finta]] in 1653. A few years later, Moldavia was occupied for two short intervals by the anti-Ottoman Wallachian prince [[Constantin Șerban]], who clashed with the first ruler of the [[Ghica family]], [[George Ghica]]. In the early 1680s, Moldavian troops under [[George Ducas]] intervened in [[right-bank Ukraine]] and assisted [[Mehmed IV]] in the [[Battle of Vienna]], only to suffer the effects of the [[Great Turkish War]].

===Phanariots (1711–1822)===
{{Main article|Phanariotes|History of the Russo-Turkish wars}}
[[File:Principati1786.jpg|thumb|The Principalities of Moldavia and [[Wallachia]] in 1782, Italian map by G. Pittori, since the geographer Giovanni Antonio Rizzi Zannoni.]]
[[File:Siege and capture of Jassy in 1788 by the Russian army.jpg|thumb|Siege and capture of [[Iași|Jassy (Iași)]] in 1788 by the Russian army]]

During the late 17th century, Moldavia became the target of the [[Russian Empire]]'s southwards expansion, inaugurated by [[Peter the Great]] with the [[Pruth River Campaign|Russo-Turkish War of 1710-1711]]. Prince [[Dimitrie Cantemir]] sided with Peter in open rebellion against the Ottomans, but he was defeated at [[Stănilești]]. Sultan [[Ahmed III]] officially discarded recognition of local choices for princes, imposing instead a system relying solely on Ottoman approval: the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote epoch]], inaugurated by the reign of [[Nicholas Mavrocordatos]].

Phanariote rule was marked by [[political corruption]], intrigue, and high taxation, as well as by sporadic incursions of Habsburg and Russian armies deep into Moldavian territory. Nonetheless, they also attempted legislative and administrative modernization inspired by [[Age of Enlightenment|The Enlightenment]] (such as the decision by [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]] to salarize public offices, to the outrage of boyars, and the abolition of serfdom in 1749, as well as [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]]'s ''Code''), and signified a decrease in Ottoman demands after the threat of Russian annexation became real and the prospects of a better life led to waves of peasant emigration to neighboring lands. The effects of Ottoman control were also made less notable after the 1774 [[Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]] allowed Russia to intervene in favour of Ottoman subjects of the Eastern Orthodox faith - leading to campaigns of petitioning by the Moldavian boyars against princely policies.

In 1712, [[Khotyn|Hotin]] was taken over by the Ottomans and became part of a defensive system that Moldavian princes were required to maintain, as well as an area for Islamic [[colonization]] (the [[Laz people|Laz]] community).

In 1775 Moldavia lost to the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] its northwestern part, which became known as [[Bukovina]]. For Moldavia, it meant both an important territorial loss and a major blow to the cattle trade, as the region stood on the trade route to Central Europe.

The [[Treaty of Jassy]] in 1792 forced the Ottoman Empire to cede [[Yedisan]] to the Russian Empire, which made Russian presence much more notable, given that the Empire acquired a common border with Moldavia. The first effect of this was the cession of the eastern half of Moldavia (renamed as [[Bessarabia]]) to the Russian Empire in 1812.

===Organic Statute, 1848 revolution===
{{Main article|National awakening of Romania|Regulamentul Organic|Moldavian Revolution of 1848|Wallachian Revolution of 1848}}
[[File:Statuia lui Ştefan cel Mare din Iaşi1.jpg|thumb|left|Iași, [[Palace of Culture (Iași)|Princely Palace]] of Moldavia]]

Phanariote rule was officially ended after the 1821 occupation of the country by [[Alexander Ypsilantis]]'s [[Filiki Eteria]] during the [[Greek War of Independence]]; the subsequent Ottoman retaliation led to the rule of [[Ioan Sturdza]]. He was considered the first of a new system, since the Ottomans and Russia had agreed in 1826 to allow for the election by locals of rulers over the two [[Danubian Principalities]], and convened on their mandating for seven-year terms. In practice, a new foundation to reigns in Moldavia was created by the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)]], beginning a period of Russian domination over the two countries which ended only in 1856. Begun as a military occupation under the command of [[Pavel Kiselyov]], Russian domination gave Wallachia and Moldavia, which were not removed from nominal Ottoman control, the modernizing ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' (the first document resembling a [[constitution]], as well as the first to regard both principalities). After 1829, the country also became an important destination for [[immigration]] of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] from the [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria]] and areas of Russia (''see [[History of the Jews in Romania]] and [[Sudiți]]'').

[[File:Obeliscul cu lei Iasi 02.JPG|thumb|Iași, [[Copou Park|Obelisk of Lions]] (1834), dedicated to the Organic Statute]]

The first Moldavian rule established under the Statute, that of [[Mihail Sturdza]], was nonetheless ambivalent: eager to reduce abuse of office, Sturdza introduced reforms (the abolition of slavery, [[secularization]], economic rebuilding), but he was widely seen as enforcing his own power over that of the newly instituted consultative Assembly. A supporter of the union of his country with Wallachia and of Romanian [[Romantic nationalism]], he obtained the establishment of a [[customs union]] between the two countries (1847) and showed support for [[Radicalism (historical)|radical]] projects favored by low boyars; nevertheless, he clamped down with noted violence the [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848|Moldavian revolutionary attempt]] in the last days of March 1848. [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]] allowed the exiled revolutionaries to return to Moldavia c. 1853, which led to the creation of the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]] ({{lang|ro|Partida Națională}}), a trans-boundary group of radical union supporters which campaigned for a single state under a foreign dynasty.

===Southern Bessarabia===
[[File:Rom1856-1859.png|thumb|Moldavia (in orange) after 1856]]
In 1856, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], the Russian Empire returned to Moldavia a significant territory in southern [[Bessarabia Governorate|Bessarabia]] (including a part of [[Budjak]]), organised later as the [[Bolgrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail|Ismail]] counties.&lt;ref name=king23-hitch41&gt;King, p.22-23; Hitchins, p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union with Wallachia===

Russian domination ended abruptly after the [[Crimean War]], when the Treaty of Paris also passed the two Romanian principalities under the tutelage of [[Great power|Great European Powers]] (together with Russia and the Ottoman overlord, power-sharing included the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[Second French Empire|French Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], and [[Prussia]]). Due to Austrian and Ottoman opposition and British reserves, the union program as demanded by radical campaigners was debated intensely. In September 1857, given that ''[[Kaymakam|Caimacam]]'' [[Nicolae Vogoride]] had perpetrated [[Electoral fraud|fraud]] in elections in Moldavia, the Powers allowed the two states to convene ad-hoc [[divan]]s, which were to decide a new constitutional framework; the result showed overwhelming support for the union, as the creation of a [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state. After further meetings among leaders of tutor states, an agreement was reached (the ''Paris Convention''), whereby a limited union was to be enforced – separate governments and thrones, with only two bodies (a [[High Court of Cassation and Justice|Court of Cassation]] and a Central Commission residing in [[Focșani]]); it also stipulated that an end to all privilege was to be passed into law, and awarded back to Moldavia the areas around [[Bolhrad]], [[Cahul]], and [[Izmail]].

However, the Convention failed to note whether the two thrones could not be occupied by the same person, allowing ''Partida Națională'' to introduce the candidacy of [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza]] in both countries. On January 17 (January 5, 1859 [[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|Old Style]]), in [[Iași]], he was elected prince of Moldavia by the respective electoral body. After street pressure over the much more [[Conservatism|conservative]] body in [[Bucharest]], Cuza was elected in Wallachia as well (February 5/January 24). Exactly three years later, after diplomatic missions that helped remove opposition to the action, the formal union created the [[United Principalities]] (the basis of modern Romania) and instituted Cuza as ''[[Domnitor]]'' (all legal matters were clarified after the replacement of the prince with [[Carol I of Romania|Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]] in April 1866, and the creation of an independent [[Kingdom of Romania]] in 1881) - this officially ending the existence of the Principality of Moldavia.

==Society==

===Slavery===
[[Slavery in Romania|Slavery]] ({{lang-ro|robie}}) was part of the [[social class|social order]] from before the founding of the Principality of Moldavia, until it was [[Abolitionism|abolished]] in stages during the 1840s and 1850s. Most of the slaves were of [[Roma minority in Romania|Roma]] (Gypsy) ethnicity. There were also slaves of [[Tatars|Tatar]] ethnicity, probably prisoners captured from the wars with the [[Nogai Horde|Nogai]] and [[Crimean Tatars]]. The institution of slavery was first attested in a 1470 Moldavian document, through which Prince [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]] frees Oană, a Tatar slave who had fled to [[History of Poland during the Jagiellon dynasty|Jagiellon Poland]].&lt;ref name=Achim&gt;Viorel Achim, ''The Roma in Romanian History'', Central European University Press, Budapest, 2004, {{ISBN|963-9241-84-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origins of slavery are not known, as it was a common [[Slavery in medieval Europe|practice in medieval Europe]]. As in the [[Byzantine Empire]], the Roma were held as slaves of the state, of the [[boyars]] or of the monasteries. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] associated the Roma people's arrival with the 1241 [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] and considered their slavery as a vestige of that era; he believed that the Romanians took the Roma as slaves from the [[Mongols]] and preserved their status to control their labor. Other historians consider that the Roma were enslaved while captured during the battles with the Tatars. The practice of enslaving prisoners may also have been taken from the Mongols. The ethnic identity of the "Tatar slaves" is unknown, they could have been captured Tatars of the [[Golden Horde]], [[Cuman people|Cumans]], or the slaves of Tatars and Cumans.&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt; While it is possible that some Romani people were slaves or auxiliary troops of the Mongols or Tatars, most of them came from south of the [[Danube]], demonstrating that slavery a widespread practice. The Tatar slaves, smaller in numbers, were eventually merged into the Roma population.&lt;ref name=Stefanescu&gt;Ștefan Ștefănescu, ''Istoria medie a României'', Vol. I, Editura Universității din București, Bucharest, 1991 {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, Roma slaves were divided into three categories. The smallest was owned by the ''hospodars'', and went by the Romanian-language name of ''țigani domnești'' ("Gypsies belonging to the lord"). The two other categories comprised ''țigani mănăstirești'' ("Gypsies belonging to the monasteries"), who were the property of [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] monasteries, and ''țigani boierești'' ("Gypsies belonging to the boyars"), who were enslaved by the category of landowners.&lt;ref name=Djuvara&gt;[[Neagu Djuvara]], ''Între Orient și Occident. Țările române la începutul epocii moderne'', Humanitas, Bucharest, 1995. {{ISBN|973-28-0523-4}} {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guy&gt;Will Guy, ''Between Past and Future: The Roma of Central and Eastern Europe'', University of Hertfordshire Press, Hatfield, 2001. {{ISBN|1-902806-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abolition of slavery was carried out following a campaign by young revolutionaries who embraced the [[Liberalism|liberal]] ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. In 1844, Moldavian Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] proposed a law on the freeing of slaves owned by the church and state. By the 1850s, the movement gained support from almost the whole of Romanian society. In December 1855, following a proposal by Prince [[Grigore Alexandru Ghica]], a bill drafted by [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] and [[Petre Mavrogheni]] was adopted by the Divan; the law emancipated all slaves to the status of taxpayers (citizens).&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt;&lt;ref name=Djuvara/&gt;

Support for the abolitionists was reflected in [[Romanian literature]] of the mid-19th century. The issue of the Roma slavery became a theme in the literary works of various [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] intellectuals, many of whom were active in the abolitionist camp. The Romanian abolitionist movement was also influenced by the much larger movement against [[Slavery in the United States|Black slavery]] in the United States through press reports and through a translation of [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Translated by Theodor Codrescu and first published in [[Iași]] in 1853, under the name ''Coliba lui Moșu Toma sau Viața negrilor în sudul Statelor Unite din America'' (which translates back as "Uncle Toma's Cabin or the Life of Blacks in the Southern United States of America"), it was the first American novel to be published in Romanian. The foreword included a study on slavery by Mihail Kogălniceanu.&lt;ref name=Achim/&gt;

==Military forces==
{{main article|Moldavian military forces}}

[[File:Kingdom of Hungary against Moldovans flag in battle.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Moldavian troops in battle, as illustrated in [[Johannes de Thurocz]] (1488 edition); the [[Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia|Moldavian flag]] is displayed]]
Under the reign of [[Stephen III of Moldavia|Stephen the Great]], all farmers and villagers had to bear arms. Stephen justified this by saying that "every man has a duty to defend his fatherland"; according to Polish chronicler [[Jan Długosz]], if someone was found without carrying a weapon, he was [[Death sentence|sentenced to death]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Annals of Jan Długosz'', p. 566&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen reformed the army by promoting men from the landed free peasantry ''răzeși'' (i.e. something akin to [[freehold (law)|freeholding]] [[yeomen]]) to infantry (''voinici'') and light cavalry (''hânsari'') — to make himself less dependent on the [[boyars]] — and introduced his army to guns. In times of crises, The Small Host (''Oastea Mică'') — which consisted of around 10,000 to 12,000 men — stood ready to engage the enemy, while the Large Host (''Oastea Mare'') — which could reach up to 40,000 — had all the free peasantry older than 14, and strong enough to carry a [[sword]] or use the [[Bow (weapon)|bow]], recruited. This seldom happened, for such a [[levée en masse]] was devastating for both economy and population growth. In the [[Battle of Vaslui]], Stephen had to summon the Large Host and also recruited [[mercenary]] troops.

[[File:Moldavian battle flag.jpg|thumb|Battle flag of Stephen the Great]]
In the [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Renaissance]], the Moldavians relied on light [[cavalry]] (''[[Călărași (cavalry)|călărași]]'') which used [[hit-and-run tactics]] similar to those of the [[Tatars]]; this gave them great mobility and also flexibility, in case they found it more suitable to dismount their horses and fight in hand-to-hand combat, as it happened in 1422, when 400 [[horse archer]]s were sent to aid [[History of Poland (1385–1569)|Jagiellon Poland]], Moldavia’s overlord against the [[Teutonic Knights]]. When making eye-contact with the enemy, the horse archers would withdraw to a nearby forest and [[camouflage]] themselves with leaves and branches; according to Jan Długosz, when the enemy entered the wood, they were "showered with arrows" and defeated.&lt;ref&gt;Długosz, p. 438&lt;/ref&gt;  The heavy cavalry consisted of the nobility, namely, the boyars and their guards, the ''viteji'' (lit. "brave ones", small nobility) and the ''curteni'' — the Court Cavalry (all nominally part of the ''Small Host''). In times of war, boyars were compelled by the [[Feudalism|feudal system of allegiance]] to supply the prince with troops in accordance with the extent of their [[Manorialism|manorial domain]].

Other troops consisted of professional foot soldiers (''lefegii'') which fulfilled the [[Heavy infantry#Middle Ages|heavy infantry]] role, and the ''plăieși'', free peasants whose role was that of border guards: they guarded the mountain passes and were prepared to [[ambush]] the enemy and to fight delaying actions.

In the absence of the prince, command was assigned to the ''Mare Spătar'' (Grand Sword-Bearer - a military office) or to the ''Mare Vornic'' (approx. Governor of the Country; a civilian office second only to the ''[[Voievod#Moldavia and Wallachia|Voievod]]'', which was filled by the prince himself). Supplying the troops was by tradition-later-made-into-law the duty of the inhabitants of those lands on which the soldiers were present at a given time.

The Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') favourite military doctrine in (defensive) wars was a [[scorched earth]] policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using [[hit-and-run tactics]] and disruption of communication and supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured in a place where it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains of what was once the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed all the way to the border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the [[Battle of Vaslui]].

Towards the end of the 15th century, especially after the success of [[gun]]s and [[cannon]]s, mercenaries became a dominant force in the country’s military. With the economic demands created by the [[stagnation of the Ottoman Empire]], the force diminished and included only mercenaries such as the ''[[seimeni]]''.

The 1829 [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] allowed Moldavia to again maintain its own troops, no longer acting as an auxiliary under strict Ottoman supervision, and assigned red over blue [[Flag terminology|pennants]] (''see [[Flag and coat of arms of Moldavia]]''). Their renewed existence under [[Mihail Sturdza]] was a major symbol and rally point for the [[Romantic nationalism|nationalist]] cause, aiding in bringing about the [[1848 Moldavian revolution]].

===Fleet===

An early mention of a Moldavian [[naval fleet]] is found in connection with the rule of [[Aron Tiranul]], who used it to help [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian ruler]] [[Michael the Brave]] establish his control over the [[Chilia branch]] of the [[Danube]] and [[Dobruja]].

The Treaty of Adrianople provided for a Moldavian self-defense naval force, to be composed of [[caicque]] vessels. [[Schooner]]s armed with [[cannon]]s were first built in the 1840s. Along with patrolling the Danube, these made their way on its tributaries, the [[Siret River|Siret]] and the [[Prut River]].

==Geography==
{{See also|Moldavian Plateau}}
[[File:PhysicalAncientMoldavia.jpg|thumb|Physical map of Moldavia]]
Geographically, Moldavia is limited by the [[Carpathian Mountains]] to the West, the [[Cheremosh River]] to the North, the [[Dniester River]] to the East and the [[Danube]] and [[Black Sea]] to the South. The [[Prut River]] flows approximately through its middle from north to south.

Of late 15th century Moldavia, with an area of approximately {{convert|97000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the biggest part and the core of the former principality is located in Romania (47.5%), followed by the [[Republic of Moldova]] (30.5%) and Ukraine (22%). This represents 88% of the Republic of Moldova's surface, 19.5% of Romania's surface, and 3.5% of Ukraine's surface.
&lt;!-- 21,263 km2 in Ukraine + 46,158 km2 in Romania + 29,683 km2 in Moldova --&gt;

The region is mostly hilly, with a range of mountains in the west, and plain areas in the southeast. Moldavia's highest altitude is [[Ineu Peak|Ineu]] peak (2,279&amp;nbsp;m), which is also the westernmost point of the region.

==Education==
[[File:AcademiaMihaileana.jpg|thumb|[[Academia Mihăileană]] was the first modern institution of higher learning in Moldavia]]
In 1562, the so-called [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid|Schola Latina]] (a Latin Academic College) was founded in [[Cotnari]], near [[Iași]], a school which marked the beginnings of the organized humanistic education institutions in Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanianweek.ro/educatie.html Schola Latina - The Foundation of the first School in which mathematics was taught in Roumania]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was [[Vasilian College|Academia Vasiliană]] (1640),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.study-in-romania.ro/historyofeducation.htm History of Education]&lt;/ref&gt; founded by Prince Vasile Lupu as a ''Higher School for Latin and Slavonic Languages'', followed by the [[Princely Academy, Iași|Princely Academy]], in 1707. The first high education structure in [[Romanian language]] was established in the autumn of 1813, when [[Gheorghe Asachi]] laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the Greek Princely Academy.

After 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian language, regarding both [[humanities]] and the technical science. [[Academia Mihăileană]], founded in 1835 by Prince Mihail Sturdza, is considered the first Romanian superior institute. In 1860, three faculties part of the Academia Mihăileană formed the nucleus for the newly established [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]], the first Romanian modern university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uaic.ro/en/university-2/university/ History of the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University of Iași]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Gallez''' (1920–2007) was an Argentinian cartographer and historian, born in [[Brussels]], and based on the city of [[Bahía Blanca]], [[province of Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].

He made an extensive research on maps to show that [[United States|America]] was known long before the [[Age of Discovery]], inspired by previous works by [[Dick Edgar Ibarra Grasso]] and [[Enrique de Gandía]].

He was the first to identify all the principal fluvial system of [[South America]] in the [[Henricus Martellus Germanus]] map of 1489, using a [[distortion grid]].

He considers that fellow historians and himself constitutes the so-called [[Argentine School of Protocartography]].

'''Posidonius'''  ({{lang-grc-gre|Ποσειδώνιος}}, ''Poseidonios'', meaning "of [[Poseidon]]") "of [[Apamea (Syria)|Apameia]]" (ὁ Ἀπαμεύς) or "of [[Rhodes]]" (ὁ Ῥόδιος) (c. 135 BCE – c. 51 BCE), was a [[Greeks|Greek]]&lt;ref name=Sarton&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink= George Sarton | last= Sarton |first= George |date= 1936 |title= The Unity and Diversity of the Mediterranean World |journal= Osiris |volume= 2| pages= 406–463 [430] | doi=10.1086/368462}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stoicism|Stoic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9061021/Poseidonius "Poseidonius"], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', "Greek philosopher, considered the most learned man of his time and, possibly, of the entire Stoic school."&lt;/ref&gt; [[philosopher]], [[politician]], [[astronomer]], [[geographer]], [[historian]] and [[teacher]] native to Apamea, [[History of Syria|Syria]].&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Posidonius |volume=22 |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MagillAves1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magill|first1=Frank Northen|last2=Aves|first2=Alison|title=Dictionary of World Biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wyKaVFZqbdUC|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9781579580407|pages=904–910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was acclaimed as the greatest [[polymath]] of his age. His vast body of work exists today only in fragments.

Writers such as [[Strabo]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] provide most of the information, from history, about his life.

==Early life==
Posidonius, nicknamed "the Athlete", was born to a Greek&lt;ref name=Sarton/&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; family in [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]], a Hellenistic city on the river [[Orontes river|Orontes]] in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]].

Posidonius completed his higher education in [[Athens]], where he was a student of the aged [[Panaetius]], the head of the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] school. But soon he came in conflict with the Stoic doctrines and was involved in heated debates with many other Stoic philosophers of the school. The incidents concerning Posidonius's conflict and final break up with the Stoics are mentioned by [[Galen]] in his book ''On the Doctrines of Plato and Hippocrates''. Eventually Posidonius gave up Stoicism and turned to a different philosophical direction, this of [[Plato]] but mainly of [[Aristotle]], remaining a faithful follower of Aristotelian doctrines until his death.

He settled around 95 BCE in Rhodes, a maritime state which had a reputation for scientific research, and became a citizen.

==Career==
In Rhodes, Posidonius actively took part in political life, and his high standing is apparent from the offices he held. He attained the highest public office as one of the [[Prytaneis]] (presidents, having a six months tenure) of Rhodes. He served as an ambassador to Rome in 87–86 BCE, during the [[Gaius Marius|Marian]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sullan]] era.

Along with other Greek intellectuals, Posidonius favored Rome as the stabilizing power in a turbulent world. His connections to the Roman ruling class were for him not only politically important and sensible but were also important to his scientific research. His entry into government provided Posidonius with powerful connections to facilitate his travels to far away places, even beyond Roman control.

After he had established himself in Rhodes, Posidonius made one or more journeys traveling throughout the Roman world and even beyond its boundaries to conduct scientific research. He traveled in [[Greece]], [[Hispania]], [[Italy]], [[Sicily]], [[Dalmatia]], [[Gaul]], [[Liguria]], [[North Africa]], and on the eastern shores of the [[Adriatic]].

In Hispania, on the Atlantic coast at Gades (the modern [[Cadiz]]), Posidonius could observe tides much higher than in his native Mediterranean. He wrote that daily tides are related to the [[Moon]]'s orbit, while tidal heights vary with the cycles of the [[Moon]], and he hypothesized about yearly tidal cycles synchronized with the equinoxes and solstices.

In Gaul, he studied the [[Celt]]s. He left vivid descriptions of things he saw with his own eyes while among them: men who were paid to allow their throats to be slit for public amusement and the nailing of skulls as trophies to the doorways.&lt;ref&gt;Posidonius, fragment 16 (quoted by [http://www.attalus.org/old/athenaeus4.html#154 Athenaeus, Book 4]) and fragment 55 (quoted by [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/4D*.html#4.5 Strabo, Book 4]).&lt;/ref&gt; But he noted that the Celts honored the [[Druids]], whom Posidonius saw as philosophers, and concluded that, even among the barbaric, "pride and passion give way to wisdom, and Ares stands in awe of the Muses." He wrote a geographic treatise on the lands of the [[Celt]]s which has since been lost, but which is referred to extensively (both directly and otherwise) in the works of [[Diodorus of Sicily]], [[Strabo]], [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]] and [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Germania (book)|Germania]]''.

==School==
Posidonius's extensive writings and lectures gave him authority as a scholar and made him famous everywhere in the Graeco-Roman world, and a school grew around him in Rhodes. His grandson [[Jason of Nysa|Jason]], who was the son of his daughter and Menekrates of [[Nysa, Anatolia|Nysa]], followed in his footsteps and continued Posidonius's school in Rhodes. Although little is known of the organization of his school, it is clear that Posidonius had a steady stream of Greek and Roman students.

==Partial scope of writings==
Posidonius was celebrated as a [[polymath]] throughout the Graeco-Roman world because he came near to mastering all the knowledge of his time, similar to [[Aristotle]] and [[Eratosthenes]]. He attempted to create a unified system for understanding the human intellect and the universe which would provide an explanation of and a guide for human behavior.

Posidonius wrote on [[physics]] (including [[meteorology]] and [[physical geography]]), [[astronomy]], [[astrology]] and [[divination]], [[seismology]], [[geology]] and [[mineralogy]], [[hydrology]], [[botany]], [[ethics]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[history]], [[natural history]], [[anthropology]], and [[tactic (method)|tactics]]. His studies were major investigations into their subjects, although not without errors.

{{Interlanguage link multi|Wilhelm Capelle|de}} (''Neue Jahrbücher'', 1905), traced most of the doctrines of [[De Mundo]], to Poseidonius, a popular philosophic treatise based on two works of ''Poseidonius''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/demundoarisrich|title=De Mundo|year=1914|author=Aristotle; Forster, E. S. (Edward Seymour), 1879-1950; Dobson, J. F. (John Frederic), 1875-1947|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

None of his works survive intact. All that have been found are fragments, although the titles and subjects of many of his books are known.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I. G. [http://assets.cambridge.org/052160/4419/toc/0521604419_toc.pdf Posidonius: ''The Translation of the Fragments'', Volume III]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
For Posidonius, philosophy was the dominant master art and all the individual sciences were subordinate to philosophy, which alone could explain the cosmos. All his works, from scientific to historical, were inseparably philosophical.

He accepted the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] categorization of philosophy into physics (natural philosophy, including [[metaphysics]] and theology), logic (including dialectic), and ethics.&lt;ref name="diog1"&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ''The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers'', [http://www.attalus.org/old/diogenes7b.html#39 7.39-40].&lt;/ref&gt; These three categories for him were, in Stoic fashion, inseparable and interdependent parts of an organic, natural whole. He compared them to a living being, with physics the meat and blood, logic the bones and tendons holding the organism together, and finally ethics &amp;ndash; the most important part &amp;ndash; corresponding to the soul.&lt;ref name="diog1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Against the Professors'', 7.19.&lt;/ref&gt; His philosophical grand vision was that the universe itself was similarly interconnected, as if an organism, through cosmic "sympathy", in all respects from the development of the physical world to the history of humanity.

Although a firm Stoic, Posidonius was, like Panaetius and other Stoics of the middle period, eclectic. He followed not only the older Stoics, but also [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. Although it is not certain, Posidonius may have written a commentary on Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.

He was the first Stoic to depart from the orthodox doctrine that passions were faulty judgments and posit that Plato's view of the soul had been correct, namely that passions were inherent in human nature. In addition to the rational faculties, Posidonius taught that the human soul had faculties that were spirited (anger, desires for power, possessions, etc.) and desiderative (desires for sex and food). Ethics was the problem of how to deal with these passions and restore reason as the dominant faculty.

===Physics===
In physics, Posidonius advocated a theory of cosmic "sympathy" (συμπάθεια, ''sumpatheia''), the organic interrelation of all appearances in the world, from the sky to the earth, as part of a rational design uniting humanity and all things in the universe, even those that were temporally and spatially separate. Although his teacher Panaetius had doubted divination, Posidonius used [[Platonic philosophy]] to support his belief in divination — whether through astrology or prophetic dreams — as a kind of scientific prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''On Divination'', ii. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

===Astronomy===
Some fragments of his writings on astronomy survive through the treatise by [[Cleomedes]], ''On the Circular Motions of the Celestial Bodies'', the first chapter of the second book appearing to have been mostly copied from Posidonius.

Posidonius advanced the theory that the Sun emanated a vital force which permeated the world.

He attempted to measure the distance and size of the [[Sun]]. In about 90 BCE, Posidonius estimated the distance from the earth to the sun (see [[astronomical unit]]) to be 9,893 times the Earth's radius. This was still too small by half. In measuring the size of the Sun, however, he reached a figure larger and more accurate than those proposed by other Greek astronomers and [[Aristarchus of Samos]].&lt;ref&gt;Posidonius. [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poseidonius.html#215.K Fragment 215.K] from Cleomedes&lt;/ref&gt;

Posidonius also calculated the size and distance of the [[Moon]].

Posidonius constructed an [[orrery]], possibly similar to the [[Antikythera mechanism]]. Posidonius's orrery, according to [[Cicero]], exhibited the diurnal motions of the sun, moon, and the five known planets.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14988 ''De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)''], ii-34, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geography, ethnology, and geology ===
[[File:Worldmaphedo.jpg|thumb|450px|World map according to ideas by Posidonius (150–130 BCE), drawn in 1628 by cartographers [[Petrus Bertius]] and [[Melchior Tavernier]]. Many of the details could not have been known to Posidonius; rather, Bertius and Tavernier show Posidonius's ideas about the positions of the continents.]]
Posidonius’s fame beyond specialized philosophical circles had begun, at the latest, in the eighties with the publication of the work "about the ocean and the adjacent areas". This work was not only an overall representation of geographical questions according to current scientific knowledge, but it served to popularize his theories about the internal connections of the world, to show how all the forces had an effect on each other and how the interconnectedness applied also to human life, to the political just as to the personal spheres.

In this work, Posidonius detailed his theory of the effect on a people’s character by the climate, which included his representation of the "geography of the races". This theory was not solely scientific, but also had political implications—his Roman readers were informed that the climatic central position of Italy was an essential condition of the Roman destiny to dominate the world. As a Stoic, he did not, however, make a fundamental distinction between the civilized Romans as masters of the world and the less civilized peoples.

Posidonius calculated the [[Earth]]'s [[circumference]] by reference to the position of the star [[Canopus (star)|Canopus]]. As explained by Cleomedes, Posidonius observed Canopus on but never above the horizon at Rhodes, while at [[Alexandria]] he saw it ascend as far as 7½ degrees above the horizon (the [[meridian arc]] between the latitude of the two locales is actually 5 degrees 14 minutes). Since he thought Rhodes was 5,000 [[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]] due north of Alexandria, and the difference in the star's elevation indicated the distance between the two locales was 1/48 of the circle, he multiplied 5,000 by 48 to arrive at a figure of 240,000 stadia for the circumference of the earth.&lt;ref name="fragment 202"&gt;Posidonius, [http://www.attalus.org/translate/poseidonius.html#202.K fragment 202]&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating stadia into modern units of distance can be problematic, but it is generally thought that the stadium used by Posidonius was almost exactly 1/10 of a modern statute mile. Thus Posidonius's measure of 240,000 stadia translates to {{cvt|24000|mi|km}}, not much short of the actual circumference of {{cvt|24901|mi|km}}.&lt;ref name="fragment 202"/&gt;

[[File:Posidonius earth circumference.svg|thumb|250px|Posidonius's method for calculating the circumference of the earth, relied on the [[Horizontal coordinate system|altitude]] of the star [[Canopus]]]]
Posidonius was informed in his approach to finding the Earth's circumference by [[Eratosthenes]], who a century earlier used the elevation of the sun at different latitudes to arrive at a figure of 250,000 stadia, a result which he rounded to 252,000 so that it would be divisible by 60. Both men's figures for the Earth's circumference were uncannily accurate, aided in part in each case by mutually compensating errors in measurement.

[[Strabo]] noted that the distance between Rhodes and Alexandria is 3,750 stadia, and reported Posidonius's estimate of the Earth's circumference to be 180,000 stadia or {{cvt|18000|mi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cleomedes ([http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975QJRAS..16..152F in Fragment 202]) stated that if the distance is measured by some other number the result will be different, and using 3,750 instead of 5,000 produces this estimation: 3,750 x 48 = 180,000; see Fischer I., (1975), ''Another Look at Eratosthenes' and Posidonius' Determinations of the Earth's Circumference'', Ql. J. of the Royal Astron. Soc., Vol. 16, p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] mentions Posidonius among his sources and without naming him reported his method for estimating the Earth's circumference. He noted, however, that [[Hipparchus]] had added some 26,000 stadia to Eratosthenes's estimate. The smaller value offered by Strabo and the different lengths of Greek and Roman stadia have created a persistent confusion around Posidonius's result. [[Ptolemy]] used Posidonius's lower value of 180,000 stades (about 33% too low) for the earth's circumference in his [[Geography (Ptolemy)|''Geography'']]. This was the number used by [[Christopher Columbus]] in order to underestimate the distance to India as 70,000 stades.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Freely]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=MfhjAAAAQBAJ ''Before Galileo: The Birth of Modern Science in Medieval Europe''] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[Pytheas]], Posidonius believed the [[tide]] is caused by the moon. Posidonius was, however, wrong about the cause. Thinking that the moon was a mixture of air and fire, he attributed the cause of the tides to the heat of the moon, hot enough to cause the water to swell but not hot enough to evaporate it.

He recorded observations on both earthquakes and volcanoes, including accounts of the eruptions of the volcanoes in the [[Aeolian Islands]], north of [[Sicily]].

===Meteorology===
Posidonius in his writings on meteorology followed Aristotle. He theorized on the causes of clouds, mist, wind, and rain as well as frost, hail, lightning, and rainbows. He also estimated that the boundary between the clouds and the heavens lies about 40 stadia above the Earth.

===Mathematics===
Posidonius was one of the first to attempt to prove [[Parallel postulate|Euclid's fifth postulate of geometry]]. He suggested changing the definition of parallel straight lines to an equivalent statement that would allow him to prove the fifth postulate. From there, Euclidean geometry could be restructured, placing the fifth postulate among the theorems instead.&lt;ref&gt;Trudeau, Richard. ''The Non-Euclidean Revolution'', Boston: Birkhauser, 1987, pp. 119–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his writings on geometry, Posidonius was credited for creating some mathematical definitions, or for articulating views on technical terms, for example 'theorem' and 'problem'.

===History and tactics===
In his ''Histories'', Posidonius continued the ''World History'' of [[Polybius]]. His history of the period 146 – 88 BCE is said to have filled 52 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.attalus.org/translate/poseidonius.html#T1 Article in 'Suda']&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Histories'' continue the account of the rise and expansion of Roman dominance, which he appears to have supported. Posidonius did not follow Polybius's more detached and factual style, for Posidonius saw events as caused by human psychology; while he understood human passions and follies, he did not pardon or excuse them in his historical writing, using his narrative skill in fact to enlist the readers' approval or condemnation.

For Posidonius "history" extended beyond the earth into the sky; humanity was not isolated each in its own political history, but was a part of the cosmos. His ''Histories'' were not, therefore, concerned with isolated political history of peoples and individuals, but they included discussions of all forces and factors (geographical factors, mineral resources, climate, nutrition), which let humans act and be a part of their environment. For example, Posidonius considered the climate of Arabia and the life-giving strength of the sun, tides (taken from his book on the oceans), and climatic theory to explain people’s ethnic or national characters.

Of Posidonius's work on tactics, ''The Art of War'', the Greek historian [[Arrian]] complained that it was written 'for experts', which suggests that Posidonius may have had first hand experience of military leadership or, perhaps, utilized knowledge he gained from his acquaintance with [[Pompey]].

===On the Jews===
Posidonius's writings on the Jews were probably the source of [[Diodorus Siculus]]'s account of the siege of [[Jerusalem]] and possibly also for [[Strabo]]'s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| first1= Shemuel |last1= Safrai |first2= M. |last2= Stern |title= The Jewish people in the first century: Historical Geography |page= 1124 |date= 1988 |quote=Most scholars hold that Diodorus, from Book 33 of his work onwards, depended on Posidonius}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gmirkin, Russell E. ''[[Berossus]] and Genesis, Manetho and Exodus: Hellenistic histories'', 2006, p. 54. "Jewish misanthropy was also a feature in Posidonius's account of the Jews, though in a less extreme form. 126 Diodorus Siculus, Library 40.3.4b likely derived from Posidonius, whose history may have been consulted by [[Pompey]]..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bar-Kochva, Bezalel. ''The Image of the Jews in Greek Literature: The Hellenistic Period'', 2009, p. 440. "Posidonius of apamea (d) The Anti-Jewish Libels and Accusations in Diodorus and Apion We have seen in chapters 11–12 that Posidonius used [[Moses]] and Mosaic Judaism to portray his own religious, social, and political ideals."&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Posidonius's arguments are contested by [[Josephus]] in ''[[Against Apion]]''.

==Reputation and influence==
[[File:Posidonius Nuremberg Chronicle.jpg|right|thumb|Posidonius, depicted as a medieval scholar in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'']]
In his own era, his writings on almost all the principal divisions of philosophy made Posidonius a renowned international figure throughout the Graeco-Roman world and he was widely cited by writers of his era, including [[Cicero]], [[Livy]], [[Plutarch]], [[Strabo]] (who called Posidonius "the most learned of all philosophers of my time"), Cleomedes, [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] (who used Posidonius as a source for his ''Bibliotheca historia'' ["Historical Library"]), and others.  Although his ornate and rhetorical style of writing passed out of fashion soon after his death, Posidonius was acclaimed during his life for his literary ability and as a stylist.

Posidonius was the major source of materials on the [[Celts]] of [[Gaul]] and was profusely quoted by [[Timagenes]], [[Julius Caesar]], the Sicilian Greek [[Diodorus Siculus]], and the Greek geographer [[Strabo]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Posidonius appears to have moved with ease among the upper echelons of Roman society as an ambassador from Rhodes. He associated with some of the leading figures of late republican Rome, including Cicero and Pompey, both of whom visited him in Rhodes. In his twenties, Cicero attended his lectures (77 BCE) and they continued to correspond. Cicero in his ''De Finibus'' closely followed Posidonius's presentation of Panaetius's ethical teachings.

Posidonius met Pompey when he was Rhodes's ambassador in Rome and Pompey visited him in Rhodes twice, once in 66 BCE during his campaign against the pirates and again in 62 BCE during his eastern campaigns, and asked Posidonius to write his biography. As a gesture of respect and great honor, Pompey lowered his ''[[fasces]]'' before Posidonius's door. Other Romans who visited Posidonius in Rhodes were Velleius, Cotta, and [[Lucilius]].

[[Ptolemy]] was impressed by the sophistication of Posidonius's methods, which included correcting for the refraction of light passing through denser air near the horizon. Ptolemy's approval of Posidonius's result, rather than Eratosthenes's earlier and more correct figure, caused it to become the accepted value for the Earth's circumference for the next 1,500 years.

Posidonius fortified the Stoicism of the middle period with contemporary learning. Next to his teacher Panaetius, he did most, by writings and personal contacts, to spread Stoicism in the Roman world. A century later, Seneca referred to Posidonius as one of those who had made the largest contribution to philosophy.

His influence on philosophical thinking lasted until the [[Middle Ages]], as is shown by citation in the [[Suda]], the massive medieval [[lexicon]].

At one time, scholars perceived Posidonius's influence in almost every subsequent writer, whether warranted or not. Today, Posidonius seems to be recognized as having had an inquiring and wide-ranging mind, not entirely original, but with a breadth of view that connected, in accordance with his underlying Stoic philosophy, all things and their causes and all knowledge into an overarching, unified world view.

The crater [[Posidonius (crater)|Posidonius]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

==Death==
Posidonius probably died in [[Rome]] or [[Rhodes]] in about 51 BCE.

The biological Reserve Carapa is located in the [[Canindeyu Department|Department of Canindeyú]], [[Paraguay]], on the right bank of the river Paraná, and is one of the sites earmarked as 8 ecological reserve by the [[Itaipu Dam|Itaipu]], the largest dam in production in the world, located between Paraguay and Brazil. It is located at 260&amp;nbsp;km north of the [[Ciudad del Este]]. It was founded in 1984 and has 3,250 [[Hectare|has]].

==Geography ==

Surrounded by mountains and land with very steep slopes. The soils are the type latosol textured red clay.
[[Image:Carapa entrada refugio.png|right|250px|thumb|Entrada al Refugio]]

==Weather ==

The weather is warm, humid and warm resulting in the overall situation in the sub mesotermal humid tropics. Annual precipitation of 1,300&amp;nbsp;mm. The drainage basin of the river Carapâ is composed of several tributaries that arise in different parts of the Department of Canindeyu (Paraguay).

==Animals and plants ==

The vegetation of the refuge is composed of associations of forest high, low forest, swamps, high camp, camp low, primitive forest  and forest near the river. The dominant species are composed of: [[Tabebuia]], '''Peltophorum dubium''' and [[Cedrela fissilis]].

Of the animal species recorded, most are in the range of endangered, among those mentioned: Lobo water ([[Lutra longicaudis]]), Pork Mount ([[collared peccary]]), among carnivores [[Felis]], people are casual because it is part of its territorial displacement. Of all the species recorded in the area of Itaipu dam, 61.4% belong to the River area Carapâ.

== Infrastructure and use of refuge ==

The refuge has a structure in which edilicia living and working professionals and technicians on a permanent basis.

Overall objective of the refuge: 
&lt;!-- Missing image removed: [[Image:Mapa u2.jpg|thumb|400px|right|refuges and reserves in the area]]  --&gt;

==Itaipu Lake ==
[[Image:Carapa sendero.png|right|250px|thumb|Carapá]]
This reserve, bordering Lake is artificially created by Itaipu. Being formed in 1982, a series of economic alternatives that are already beginning to be exploited by the 77 neighboring municipalities. The artificial lake is one of the largest in the world, with 29 million m³ and 200&amp;nbsp;km extension in a straight line. Considering the bays, inlets and length reaches 1,400&amp;nbsp;km.

The formation of the lake has not only changed the look of the geographic region. The agriculture, regional economic base, begins to cede place to tourism. Several artificial beaches were created along the banks of the lake, where he practiced all sorts of water sports.

== Area subdivision==

According to latest techniques of management of protected areas, this refuge is divided into distinct zones in order to handle them properly.

*'''Areas of special use''': areas include reduced in size and which are essential for the administration, office accommodation, restaurant, aviation runway, and so on
*'''Zone extensive use''': areas to which visitors access for education and recreation (and self-guided interpretive trails, paths "cross country", etc.)
*'''Zones intensive''': consist of areas with outstanding scenery and that lend themselves to relatively dense recreational activities (camping areas, visitors' centers and scenic lookouts) 
*'''Buffer Zones and Recovery''': areas that have been severely damaged and it is mostly to areas adjacent to the surrounding populations
*'''Zone Core''': natural areas that have received the minimum of disruption caused by man (with three distinct nuclei and characteristic of the place)

The reserve has a panoramic viewpoint, which can be seen most of the wooded area, as well as the vast body of water formed by the dam. The combined resources of vegetation, topography and water give it a priceless value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6694">The '''São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón moist lowland forests''' is a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[terrestrial ecoregion|ecoregion]] that covers the islands of [[São Tomé Island|São Tomé]] and [[Príncipe]], which form the island nation of [[São Tomé and Príncipe]], as well as the island of [[Annobón]], which is part of [[Equatorial Guinea]].

==Setting==
[[Image:Gulf of Guinea (English).jpg|thumb|right|350px|Map of the [[Gulf of Guinea]], showing São Tomé, Príncipe, and Annobón. These islands, together with the island of [[Bioko]] and [[Mount Cameroon]] on the African mainland, are part of the [[Cameroon line]] of volcanoes.]]
The three islands are [[volcano|volcanic]], part of the [[Cameroon Line]] of volcanoes that extends from Annobón in the southwest, through the islands of São Tomé, Príncipe, and Bioko, and onto the mainland as [[Mount Cameroon]] and the volcanoes of the [[Cameroon Highlands]].

Príncipe is the northernmost island, and lies closest to the African mainland, with an area of 128&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. São Tomé is the largest of the islands, approximately 836&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and lies southwest of Príncipe. Annobón is the southernmost island and lies furthest from the African coast, with an area of 17&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The islands are mountainous, with the highest peaks reaching to 2,024 meters  on São Tomé ([[Pico de São Tomé]]), 948 meters on Príncipe ([[Pico do Príncipe]]), and 598 meters on Annobón ([[Quioveo|Pico Quioveo]]).

Príncipe is the oldest of the islands, with the oldest rocks dating back 31 million years. São Tomé is 14 million years old, and Annobón 4.8 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, D-C., A.N. Halliday, J.G. Fitton, G. Poli. 1994. "Isotopic variations with distance and time in the volcanic islands of the Cameroon line: evidence for a mantle plume origin." ''Earth and Planetary Science Letters'' 123:119-138.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the islands have been connected to mainland Africa.

The Tinhosas islands are two unvegetated rocky islets lying 22&amp;nbsp;km south of Príncipe. [[Tinhosa Grande]] has an area of 22 hectares, and reaches 56 meters elevation, and [[Tinhosa Pequena]] is 3 hectares in area and 65 meters elevation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Christy, Patrice. "Important Bird Areas in Africa and associated islands – São Tomé and Príncipe" BirdLife International.&lt;/ref&gt; See also: [[Wildlife of São Tomé and Príncipe]].

==Flora==
The natural vegetation of the islands consisted of forests, which varied based on exposure and elevation, including wet lowland forests on the south and southwest portion of the islands, facing the prevailing winds, and drier lowland forests to the north and east in the islands' rain shadow. On São Tomé, lowland forests extend from sea level to 800 meters elevation, montane forests from 800 to 1400 meters elevation, and cloud forests above 1400 meters elevation. The upper montane forests and cloud forests include plants characteristic of [[afromontane]] flora, including ''[[Olea capensis]], [[Syzygium guineense]]'', and ''Pauridiantha floribunda'', and the endemic trees  ''[[Afrocarpus mannii]], [[Tabernaemontana stenosiphon]], [[Homalium henriquesii]], Croton stelluliferus, [[Polyscias quintasii]],'' and ''Craterispermum montanum''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

There are 37 endemic plant species on Príncipe, 95 on São Tomé (along with one endemic genus), and 20 on Annobón. Only 16 of the islands' endemic plants are shared by more than one island.&lt;ref name=wwf&gt;{{WWF ecoregion|id=at0127|name=Sao Tome, Principe and Annobon moist lowland forests|accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==

===Birds===
The islands are home to 143 species of birds, including 72 breeding resident species.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

28 bird species, all forest dwellers, are endemic to ecoregion.&lt;ref name=wwf/&gt; Seven species are endemic to Príncipe. The endemic subspecies of [[olive ibis]] on Príncipe, ''B. o. rothschildi'', is probably the rarest bird in the archipelago.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Sixteen species are endemic to São Tomé, with two endemic genera. These include the [[São Tomé ibis]] (''Bostrychia bocagei''), [[São Tomé olive pigeon]] (''Columba thomensis''), [[São Tomé scops-owl]] (''Otus hartlaubi''), [[São Tomé fiscal]] (''Lanius newtoni''), [[São Tomé shorttail]] (''Amaurocichla bocagii''), [[giant sunbird]] (''Nectarinia thomensis''), [[São Tomé grosbeak]] (''Neospiza concolor'') and [[São Tomé oriole]] (''Oriolus crassirostris'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Annobón is home to the endemic [[Annobón white-eye]] (''Zosterops griseovirescens'') and [[Annobón paradise-flycatcher]], (''Terpsiphone smithii''). An additional four endemic species inhabit two or more of the islands, including the [[Príncipe speirops]] (''Speirops leucophoeus'') and [[velvet-mantled drongo]] (''Dicrurus modestus''), which inhabit both São Tomé and Príncipe, and the [[São Tomé bronze-naped pigeon]] (''Columba malherbii'') which inhabits both São Tomé and Annobón.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The Tinhosas islands are home to the largest seabird colonies in the Gulf of Guinea, with breeding colonies of [[sooty tern]]s (''Onychoprion fuscatus'', 100,000 breeding pairs), [[Black noddy|black noddies]] (''Anous minutus'', 10,000–20,000 breeding pairs), [[Brown noddy|brown noddies]] (''Anous stolidus'', 4,000–8,000 breeding pairs), [[Brown booby|brown boobies]]
(''Sula leucogaster,'' 1,500–3,000 breeding pairs) and small numbers of [[white-tailed tropicbird]]s (''Phaethon lepturus'').&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Mammals===
The ecoregion is home to three endemic mammal species: the [[São Tomé shrew]] (''Crocidura thomensis''), [[São Tomé collared fruit bat]] (''Myonycteris brachycephala'') and [[São Tomé free-tailed bat]] (''Chaerephon tomensis'').

==Human impacts==
{{Empty section|date=July 2010}}

==Conservation==
Protected areas in the ecoregion include [[Obo Natural Park]], which includes the Tinhosas islands and portions of São Tomé and Príncipe islands, and the [[Annobón Natural Reserve]] on Annobón.

{{redirect|Prominence}}

In [[topography]], '''prominence'''{{efn|name="synonyms"|1=Topographic prominence is also known as '''autonomous height''', '''relative height''', and '''shoulder drop''' in North America. In Britain it is usually called '''drop''' or '''relative height'''.}} measures the height of a mountain or hill's summit relative to the lowest [[contour line]] encircling it but containing no higher summit within it. It is a measure of the independence of a [[Topographical summit|summit]]. A peak's ''key [[col]]'' (highest gap between two mountains) is a unique point on this contour line and the '''parent peak''' is some higher mountain, selected according to various objective criteria.

==Definitions==
[[File:prominence_definition.svg|right|thumb|250px|Figure 1. Vertical arrows show the topographic prominence of three peaks on an island. The dashed horizontal lines show the lowest contours that do not encircle higher peaks. Curved arrows point from a peak to its parent.]]
There are at least two (related) definitions of prominence:

* The prominence of a peak is '''the minimum height necessary to descend to get from the summit to any higher terrain''', which can be calculated for a given peak in the following way: for every path connecting the peak to higher terrain, find the lowest point on the path; the ''key [[col]]'' (or ''key [[Saddle point|saddle]]'', or ''linking col'', or ''link'') is defined as the highest of these points, along all connecting paths; the prominence is the difference between the elevation of the peak and the elevation of its key col. See Figure&amp;nbsp;1. (This implies that the key col of any island or [[continent]]al highpoint where a higher point exists on another landmass (that is, all except [[Everest]]) will be the ocean, so the prominence of the peak is equal to its elevation above sea level, hence a convention that the prominence of Mount Everest is also defined to be equal to its elevation.)
* The prominence of a peak is '''the height of the peak’s summit above the lowest [[contour line]] encircling it but containing no higher summit''' within it. Note that by this definition, the prominence of Everest ''can'' be calculated, and does indeed equal its elevation (thus, using this definition, no convention regarding Everest is required.)

==Illustration==
[[File:Topographic prominence.png|right|thumb|400px|Topographic prominence of three peaks near Great Pond Mountain, Maine, USA. Red triangles mark the peaks, the lowest contour line encircling each peak are shown in black and the green dots mark the key cols. The prominences are Atkins Hill: 430&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;310 =&amp;nbsp;120 ft, Cave Hill: 570&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;530 =&amp;nbsp;40 ft, Mead Mountain: 671&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;530 =&amp;nbsp;141 ft. The parent peak of each peak is Great Pond Mountain.]]
The following mental exercise may illustrate the meaning of topographic prominence.  Imagine a peak and imagine that an imaginary sea level (based on an elevation above the [[Geoid]]) rises to the peak.  Now slowly lower the imaginary sea level and an imaginary island appears beneath your feet.  The island will grow and will merge with other islands that emerge.  Eventually, the island will touch an island with a higher peak than the initial island (i.e., an imaginary island that existed before lowering the imaginary sea level.)  The summit of that island is the parent peak of the summit, the point at which the two islands touch is the key col of the summit, and the elevation rise from the key col to the summit is the topographic prominence of the summit.

The parent peak may be either close or far from the subject peak.  The summit of [[Mount Everest]] is the parent peak of [[Aconcagua]] at a distance of 17,755&amp;nbsp;km (11,032&amp;nbsp;miles), as well as the parent of the [[Mount Everest|South Summit of Mount Everest]] at a distance of 360&amp;nbsp;m (1200&amp;nbsp;feet).  The key col may also be close or far from the subject peak.  The key col for Aconcagua, if sea level is disregarded, is the [[Bering Strait]] at a distance of 13,655&amp;nbsp;km (8,485&amp;nbsp;miles).  The key col for the South Summit of Mount Everest is about 100&amp;nbsp;m (330&amp;nbsp;feet) distant.

==In mountaineering==

Prominence is interesting to many [[mountaineering|mountaineers]] because it is an objective measurement that is strongly correlated with the subjective significance of a summit. Peaks with low prominence are either subsidiary tops of some higher summit or relatively insignificant independent summits. Peaks with high prominence tend to be the highest points around and are likely to have extraordinary views.

Only summits with a sufficient degree of prominence are regarded as independent mountains. For example, the world's second-highest mountain is [[K2]] (height 8,611&amp;nbsp;m, prominence 4,017&amp;nbsp;m). While [[Mount Everest]]'s South Summit (height 8,749&amp;nbsp;m, prominence 11&amp;nbsp;m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite peakbagger|18716|Mount Everest-South Summit, China/Nepal}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is taller than K2, it is not considered an independent mountain because it is a sub-summit of the main summit (which has a height and prominence of 8,848 m).

Many [[List of highest mountains|lists of mountains]] take topographic prominence as a criterion for inclusion, or ''cutoff''. John and Anne Nuttall's ''The Mountains of England and Wales'' uses a cutoff of 15&amp;nbsp;m (about 50&amp;nbsp;ft), and Alan Dawson's list of [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]]s uses 150&amp;nbsp;m (about 500&amp;nbsp;ft). (Dawson's list and the term "Marilyn" are limited to Britain and Ireland). In the contiguous United States, the famous list of "[[fourteener]]s" (14,000&amp;nbsp;foot / 4268&amp;nbsp;m peaks) uses a cutoff of 300&amp;nbsp;ft / 91&amp;nbsp;m (with some exceptions). Also in the U.S., 2000&amp;nbsp;ft (610&amp;nbsp;m) of prominence has become an informal threshold that signifies that a peak has major stature.
Lists with a high topographic prominence cutoff tend to favor isolated peaks or those that are the highest point of their [[massif]]; a low value, such as the Nuttalls', results in a list with many summits that may be viewed by some as insignificant.

While the use of prominence as a cutoff to form a list of peaks ranked by elevation is standard and is the most common use of the concept, it is also possible to use prominence as a mountain measure in itself. This generates [[List of peaks by prominence|lists of peaks ranked by prominence]], which are qualitatively different from lists ranked by elevation. Such lists tend to emphasize isolated high peaks, such as range or island high points and [[stratovolcano]]es. One advantage of a prominence-ranked list is that it needs no cutoff since a peak with high prominence is automatically an independent peak.

==Parent peak==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}
It is common to define a peak's ''parent'' as a particular peak in the higher terrain connected to the peak by the key col. If there are many higher peaks there are various ways of defining which one is the parent, not necessarily based on geological or geomorphological factors. The "parent" relationship defines a hierarchy which defines some peaks as subpeaks of others. For example, in Figure&amp;nbsp;1, the middle peak is a subpeak of the right peak, which is in turn a subpeak of the left peak, which is the highest point on its landmass. In that example, there is no controversy over the hierarchy; in practice, there are different definitions of parent. These different definitions follow.

A special case occurs for the highest point on an oceanic island or continent. Some sources define no parent in this case; others treat Mount Everest as the parent of every such peak with the ocean as the "key col".

===Encirclement or island parentage===
[[Image:encirclement-parent.svg|right|thumb|Figure 2. Showing two closed contour lines meeting at Peak A's key col.]]

Also called ''prominence island parentage'', this is defined as follows. In figure 2 the key col of peak&amp;nbsp;A  is at the meeting place of two closed contours, one encircling A (and no higher peaks) and the other containing at least one higher peak. The encirclement parent of A is the highest peak that is inside this other contour. In terms of the falling-sea model, the two contours together bound an island, with two pieces connected by an isthmus at the key col. The encirclement parent is the highest point on this entire island.

For example, the  encirclement parent of [[Mont Blanc]], the highest peak in the [[Alps]], is [[Mount Everest]]. Mont Blanc's key col is a piece of low ground near [[Lake Onega]] in northwestern Russia (at 113&amp;nbsp;m elevation), on the [[Water divide|divide]] between lands draining into the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. This is the meeting place of two 113&amp;nbsp;m contours, one of them encircling Mont Blanc; the other contour encircles Mount Everest. This example demonstrates that the encirclement parent can be very far away from the peak in question when the key col is low.

[[File:ProminenceDiagram.svg|thumb|Figure 3. Diagram of a mountain range showing peaks and cols, from which mountain parentage and prominences can be determined.]]
This means that, while simple to define, the encirclement parent often does not satisfy the intuitive requirement that the parent peak should be close to the child peak. For example, one common use of the concept of parent is to make clear the location of a peak. If we say that Peak&amp;nbsp;A has Mont Blanc for a parent, we would expect to find Peak&amp;nbsp;A somewhere close to Mont Blanc. This is not always the case for the various concepts of parent, and is least likely to be the case for encirclement parentage.

Figure 3 shows a schematic range of peaks with the color underlying the minor peaks indicating the encirclement parent. In this case the encirclement parent of M is H whereas an intuitive view might be that L was the parent. Indeed, if col "k" were slightly lower, L would be the true encirclement parent.

The encirclement parent is the highest possible parent for a peak; all other definitions pick out a (possibly different) peak on the combined island, a "closer" peak than the encirclement parent (if there is one), which is still "better" than the peak in question. The differences lie in what criteria are used to define "closer" and "better."

===Prominence parentage===

The (prominence) parent peak of peak A can be found by dividing the island or region in question into territories, by tracing the two hydrographic runoffs, one in each direction, downwards from the key col of every peak that is more prominent than peak A. The parent is the peak whose territory peak A is in.

For hills with low prominence in Britain, a definition of 'parent [[Marilyn (hill)|Marilyn]]' is sometimes used to classify low hills.&lt;ref name="TACit"&gt;{{cite book

The parent Marilyn is the Marilyn whose territory the hill's summit is in. If the hill is on an island (in Britain) whose highest point is less than 150m, it has no parent Marilyn.

Prominence parentage is the only definition used in the [[British Isles]] because encirclement parentage breaks down when the key col approaches sea level. Using the encirclement definition, the parent of almost any small hill in a low-lying coastal area would be [[Ben Nevis]], an unhelpful and confusing outcome. Meanwhile, 'height' parentage (see below) is not used because there is no obvious choice of cutoff.

This choice of method might at first seem arbitrary, but it provides every hill with a clear and unambiguous parent peak that is taller and more prominent than the hill itself, while also being connected to it (via ridge lines). The parent of a low hill will also usually be nearby; this becomes less likely as the hill's height and prominence increase. Using prominence parentage, one may produce a 'hierarchy' of peaks going back to the highest point on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/humps_ebook_release_1_1_0c.pdf |title=More Relative Hills of Britain |publisher=Mark Jackson |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such chain in Britain would read:

[[Billinge Hill]] → [[Winter Hill (North West England)|Winter Hill]] → [[Hail Storm Hill]] → [[Boulsworth Hill]] → [[Kinder Scout]] → [[Cross Fell]] → [[Helvellyn]] → [[Scafell Pike]] → [[Snowdon]] → [[Ben Nevis]].

At each stage in the chain, both height and prominence increase.

===Line parentage===
{{main|Line parent}}
Line parentage, also called height parentage, is similar to prominence parentage, but it requires a prominence cutoff criterion. The height parent is the closest peak to peak&amp;nbsp;A (along all ridges connected to A) that has a greater height than A, and satisfies some prominence criteria.

The disadvantage of this concept is that it goes against the intuition that a parent peak should always be more significant than its child. However it can be used to build an entire lineage for a peak which contains a great deal of information about the peak's position.

===Other criteria===
To choose among possible parents, instead of choosing the closest possible parent, it is possible to choose the one which requires the least descent along the ridge.

In general, the analysis of parents and lineages is intimately linked to studying the [[topology]] of [[Water divide|watersheds]].

==Issues in choice of summit and key col==
Alteration of the landscape by humans and presence of water features can give rise to issues in the choice of location and height of a summit or col. In Britain, extensive discussion has given rise to a protocol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/summits_and_cols.pdf |title=Defining the Summits and Cols of Hills |publisher=The Database of British and Irish Hills |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has been adopted by the main sources of prominence data in Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name="DoBIH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mountainviews.ie |title=MountainViews |publisher=mountainviews.ie |accessdate=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources of data commonly ignore man-made alterations, but this convention is not universally agreed upon; for example, some authors discount modern structures but allow ancient ones.  Another disagreement concerns [[mountaintop removal]], though for high-prominence peaks (and for low-prominence subpeaks with intact summits), the difference in prominence values for the two conventions is typically relatively small.

== Examples==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)]] --&gt;
{{original synthesis|section|date=March 2016}}
[[File:World_top_peak_prominence.svg|thumb|400px|Chart showing relationships between the 100 peaks with highest prominence on Earth. (In the [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/35/World_top_peak_prominence.svg SVG version], hover over a peak to highlight its parent(s) and click it to view its article.)]]

The key col and parent peak are often close to the subpeak but this is not always the case, especially when the key col is relatively low. It is only with the advent of computer programs and geographical databases that thorough analysis has become possible.

The key col of [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] (6,194&amp;nbsp;m) is a 56&amp;nbsp;m col near [[Lake Nicaragua]] (unless one accepts the [[Panama Canal]] as a key col; this is a matter of contention). Denali's encirclement parent is [[Aconcagua]] (6,960&amp;nbsp;m), in [[Argentina]], and its prominence is 6,138&amp;nbsp;m. To further illustrate the rising-sea model of prominence, if sea level rose 56&amp;nbsp;m, North and South America would be separate continents and Denali would be 6138&amp;nbsp;m above sea level. At a slightly lower level, the continents would still be connected, and the high point of the combined landmass would be Aconcagua, the encirclement parent. Note that, for the purposes of this article, man made structures such as the [[Panama Canal]] are not taken into account. If they were, the key col would be along the 26&amp;nbsp;m [[Gaillard Cut]] and Denali would have a prominence of 6,168&amp;nbsp;m.

While it is natural for Aconcagua to be the parent of Denali, since Denali is a major peak, consider the following situation: Peak&amp;nbsp;A is a small hill on the coast of Alaska, with elevation 100&amp;nbsp;m and key col 50&amp;nbsp;m. Then the encirclement parent of Peak&amp;nbsp;A is also Aconcagua, even though there will be many peaks closer to Peak&amp;nbsp;A which are much higher and more prominent than Peak&amp;nbsp;A (for example, Denali). This illustrates the disadvantage in using the encirclement parent.

[[Mount Whitney]] (4421&amp;nbsp;m) has its key col {{convert|1022|km|mi|abbr=on}} away in [[New Mexico]] at 1347&amp;nbsp;m on the [[Continental Divide]]. Its encirclement parent is [[Pico de Orizaba]] (5,636&amp;nbsp;m), the highest mountain in [[Mexico]]. Orizaba’s key col is back along the Divide, in [[British Columbia]].

The key col for [[Mount Mitchell (North Carolina)|Mount Mitchell]], the highest peak of the [[Appalachians]], is in Chicago, the low point on the divide between the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]] and [[Mississippi River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]]s.

A hill in a low-lying area like the [[Netherlands]] will often be a direct child of [[Mount Everest]], with its prominence about the same as its height and its key col placed at or near the foot of the hill, well below, for instance, the 113-meter-high key col of [[Mont Blanc]].

==Calculations and mathematics==

When the key col for a peak is close to the peak itself, prominence is easily computed by hand using a [[topographic map]]. However, when the key col is far away, or when one wants to calculate the prominence of many peaks at once, a computer is quite useful. [[Edward Earl]] has written a program called [[WinProm]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://github.com/edwardearl/winprom |title=WinProm|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which can be used to make such calculations, based on
a [[Digital elevation model|Digital Elevation Model]]. The underlying mathematical theory is called "[[Surface Network Modeling]]," and is closely related to [[Morse theory|Morse Theory]]. [[Andrew Kirmse]] extended this method to find every point on Earth with at least 100 feet of prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andrewkirmse.com/prominence |title=Topographic prominence |accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A note about methodology: when using a [[topographic map]] to determine prominence, one often has to estimate the height of the key col (and sometimes, the height of the peak as well) based on the contour lines. Assume for simplicity that only the col elevation is uncertain. There are three simple choices.  The ''pessimistic'', or ''clean'' prominence, assumes that the col is as high as it can be, i.e., its elevation is that of the higher contour line nearest the saddle. This gives a lower bound on the possible prominence of the peak, ignoring map error; inaccuracies in mapping lead to further uncertainties and a larger error bound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peakbagger.com/Help/Glossary.aspx |title=Help and Glossary |publisher=Peakbagger.com |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hills-database.co.uk/Accuracy%20of%20heights%20from%20OS%20maps.pdf | title=Accuracy of heights from Ordnance Survey maps |publisher=The Database of British and Irish Hills |accessdate=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Optimistic'' prominence assumes that the col is as low as possible, yielding an upper bound value for the prominence. ''Midrange'' or ''mean'' prominence uses the mean of these two values. ''Mean'' prominence is sometimes referred to as ''rise''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://listsofjohn.com/PeakStats/glossary.html#Rise |title=Definition of Rise |publisher=ListsOfJohn.com |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, where topographic mapping is more detailed than in many countries, it is customary to use a fourth method: ''interpolated'' prominence. The true prominence is estimated by visualising the three dimensional surface in the neighborhood of the col and interpolating between the enclosing contours.

Which methodology is used depends on the person doing the calculation and on the use to which the prominence is put. For example, if one is making a list of all peaks with at least 2,000&amp;nbsp;ft (610&amp;nbsp;m) of prominence, one would might use the optimistic prominence, to include all possible candidates (knowing that some of these could be dropped off the list by further, more accurate, measurements). If one wishes to present the most accurate data for the peaks, mean or interpolated prominence would be appropriate as the other measures give biased estimates.

==Wet prominence and dry prominence==
There are two varieties of topographic prominence: wet prominence and dry prominence.&lt;ref name="helman"&gt;Adam Helman, ''The Finest Peaks–Prominence and Other Mountain Measures'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;   Wet prominence is the standard topographic prominence discussed in this article. Wet prominence assumes that the surface of the earth includes all permanent water, snow, and ice features. Thus, the wet prominence of the highest summit of an ocean island or landmass is always equal to the summit's elevation.

Dry prominence, on the other hand, ignores water, snow, and ice features and assumes that the surface of the earth is defined by the solid bottom of those features. The dry prominence of a summit is equal to its wet prominence unless the summit is the highest point of a landmass or island, or its key col is covered by snow or ice.  If its highest surface col is on water, snow, or ice, the dry prominence of that summit is equal to its wet prominence plus the depth of its highest submerged col.

The dry prominence of [[Mount Everest]] is, by convention, equal to its wet prominence (8848&amp;nbsp;m) plus the depth of the deepest hydrologic  feature (the [[Challenger Deep]] at 10,911&amp;nbsp;m), or 19,761&amp;nbsp;m. The dry prominence of [[Mauna Kea]] is equal to its wet prominence (4205&amp;nbsp;m) plus the depth of its highest submerged col (about 5125&amp;nbsp;m), or about 9330&amp;nbsp;m, giving it the world's second greatest dry prominence after Mount Everest.&lt;ref name="helman"/&gt;  The dry prominence of [[Aconcagua]] is equal to its wet prominence (6962&amp;nbsp;m) plus the depth of the highest submerged col of the [[Bering Strait]] (about 50&amp;nbsp;m), or about 7012&amp;nbsp;m.

Dry prominence is also useful for measuring submerged [[seamount]]s.  Seamounts have a dry topographic prominence, a [[topographic isolation]], and a negative [[topographic elevation]].

'''Villingili''' is the only [[Tourism in the Maldives|resort island]] of [[Addu Atoll]], [[Maldives]].

In 1997 the government of the Maldives contracted the American firm [[Abonmarche]] to build a large resort and marina there, to attract tourism. Later, the government redacted this contract in 2000 and, finding no other bidders, awarded it to another firm called "Energy Tours" to build a smaller resort. Energy Tours defaulted on this contract.

In 2005 Maldives President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] contracted [[Shangri-La Hotels &amp; Resorts]], a [[Hong Kong]]-based company, to build the first luxury resort in [[Addu Atoll]]. The resort is being developed by Addu Investment Private Limited (70%) and the Maldivian Government (30%). The resort cost an estimated [[USD]] 150 million and opened in early 2009. [[Shangri-La's Villingili Resort &amp; Spa]] features a range of 132 villas including two Presidential Villas.

The island is also notable for having the highest natural elevation in the Maldives, Mount Villingili. It stands at a modest {{Convert|5.1|m}} and is located at tee number eight on Villingili’s Golf Course – the only golf course in the Maldives.  Despite its humble height, it dwarfs over the previously known highest point on Addu Atoll that stands at only {{Convert|2.4|m}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shangri-la.com/male/villingiliresort/press-room/press-releases/shangri-las-villingili-resort-spa-maldives-claims-highest-peak-in-maldives/ Shangri-La’s Villingili Resort &amp; Spa, Maldives claims highest peak in Maldives]&lt;/ref&gt;
