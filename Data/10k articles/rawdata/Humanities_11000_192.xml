'''Cahto''' (also spelled '''Kato''') is an [[language death|extinct]] [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language that was formerly spoken by the [[Kato (tribe)|Kato people]] of the Laytonville and Branscomb area at the head of the [[South Fork Eel River|South Fork of the Eel River]]. It is one of the four languages belonging to the ''California Athabaskan'' cluster of the [[Pacific Coast Athabaskan languages]]. Most Kato speakers were bilingual in [[Northern Pomo]] and some also spoke [[Yuki language|Yuki]].

'''Early voting''' (also called '''pre-poll voting''' or '''advance polling''') is a process by which voters in a public election can vote prior to the scheduled [[Election Day (politics)|election day]]. Early voting can take place remotely, such as via [[postal voting]], or in person, usually in designated early voting [[polling station]]s. The availability and time periods for early voting vary among jurisdictions and types of election. The goals of early voting are usually to increase voter participation and relieve congestion at polling stations on election day.

The categories of people who vote early include those who will be out of the polling area during the election period, poll workers, [[election campaign|campaign]] workers, people with medical procedures scheduled for that time, and adherents to religious commitments, among others.

The numbers of voters who vote early has increased in recent years. As unconditional (no excuse) early voting has gained ground, some critics have condemned the process as damaging to the democratic process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://theweek.com/article/index/233793/does-early-voting-damage-democracy |work=The Week |title=Does Early Voting Damage Democracy? |date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/early-voting-the-case-against-102748.html#.VA3hXaPp-oE |title=The Case Against Early Voting|work=PoliticoMagazine|date=January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.townhallfinance.org/columnists/jeffjacoby/2016/03/15/vote-early-vote-foolish-n2134132 Jacoby, Jeff.

March 15, 2016.] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20161103171912/http://www.townhallfinance.org/columnists/jeffjacoby/2016/03/15/vote-early-vote-foolish-n2134132 |date=November 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australia ==
In [[Australia]], where voting is compulsory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/Compulsory_Voting.htm |title=Compulsory Voting |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Commonwealth Government |access-date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, early voting is usually known as pre-poll voting. Voters are able to cast a pre-poll vote for a number of reasons, including being away from the electorate, travelling, impending maternity, being unable to leave one's workplace, having religious beliefs that prevent you from attending a polling place, or being more than 8&amp;nbsp;km from a polling place .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/ways_to_vote/ |title=Voting |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2018 |website=Australian Electoral Commission |publisher=Commonwealth Government |access-date=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Canada ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
In [[Canada]], early voting is known as advance polling. It is offered to all voters in all federal, provincial, and most municipal elections. In federal elections, voters do not need to be registered in order to vote at an advance poll, provided they are either carrying proof of identity and address, or bring a registered voter who will swear an oath of identification at the polling station on their behalf.

== Finland ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Finland and Sweden have similar early voting systems.

== Germany ==
Based on the addresses of the obligatory resident registration for all citizens, all eligible voters in [[Germany]] receive automatically a ''Wahlbenachrichtigung'' (notification of election which contains a postal vote application form). The  notification is sent at least three weeks before an election to the'' [[Bundestag]]''. It is possible to cast one's vote directly at the municipal government office that handles the application. Only voters with residence abroad must register by own acting.

The requirement for an excuse has been removed in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wahlrecht.de/news/2008/20.htm |title=Wahlrecht – News – Briefwahl nun ohne Hinderungsgrund möglich |work=Wahlrecht.de |date= |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was just an abstract assurance before that never has been validated. 19% of all voters voted early in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahl2005/downloads/Heft_5.pdf Der Bundeswahlleiter: Wahl zum 16. Deutschen Bundestag am 18. September 2005, Heft 5: Textliche Auswertung der Wahlergebnisse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225194921/http://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/bundestagswahl2005/downloads/Heft_5.pdf |date=2007-02-25 }}, page 38, table 15 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

Rules for the elections in the states, counties, and municipalities of Germany are very similar. Germans living abroad may register and vote via mail for ''Bundestag'' elections and European Parliament elections, but not for state and local elections.

== Ireland ==

In the [[Republic of Ireland]], it is traditional for voters on the remote coastal islands to vote on the day prior to the official date of the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Island voting in Election 2016 commences one day early|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/island-voting-in-election-2016-commences-one-day-early-1.2548412|website=Irish Times Newspaper - Thu, Feb 25, 2016|accessdate=3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is to avoid the possibility that bad weather might impede the delivery of ballot boxes to the count center on the mainland. However, the practice is not universally popular. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Down with this sort of thing', say islanders forced to vote day early|url=http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/election-2016/down-with-this-sort-of-thing-say-islanders-forced-to-vote-day-early-34487614.html|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Irish Independent Newspaper|date=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Malta ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2016}}
Malta introduced early voting in 2009 for general and European Parliament elections; the system was first used in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Malta)|2009 election of Members of the European Parliament]]. Elections in Malta are held over one Saturday. Electors who would be outside the country on the day and are ready to take an oath to that effect may vote one week beforehand, at the premises of the Electoral Commission.

== New Zealand ==
Early voting, or advance voting, has been possible in New Zealand without a reason since 2008. Advance voting opens 12 days before the election day, with around 500 polling booths set up across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/news-media/advance-voting-starts-monday|title=Advance voting starts on Monday|work=Electoral Commission|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters attending an appropriate advance polling booth for their [[electoral district|electorate]] (constituency) can cast an ordinary vote in the same way they would if voting on election day. If the voter is outside the electorate, enrolled after the cutoff date (31 days before election day), or is on the unpublished roll, they must cast a [[special vote]].

In the [[New Zealand general election, 2011|2011 election]], 334,600 advance votes were cast, representing 14.7% of all votes cast.&lt;ref name="NZherald"&gt;{{cite news |first= Derek |last= Cheng |date= 3 September 2014 |title= In early to make your vote count - from today |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11318064 |publisher= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate= 18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grew to 48% in the [[New Zealand general election, 2017|2017 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/advance-voting-statistics|title=Advance voting statistics|work=Electoral Commission|access-date=2017-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Norway ==
In [[Norway]] early voting is known as "forhåndsstemming". At the general election of 2009, 707,489 Norwegians voted in advance, 200 000 more than the previous record, in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/krd/pressesenter/pressemeldinger/2009-2/-har-forhandsstemt.html?id=576794 |title=707 489 har forhåndsstemt |publisher=regjeringen.no |date=2009-09-11 |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sweden ==
[[File:Advancevotinglocationmalmoe.JPG|thumb|Early polling station in a [[supermarket]] in Malmö during the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Sweden)|European Parliament election 2009]].]]
Sweden has traditionally had a high participation in elections and tries to make it as easy as possible to vote. No registration is needed, since everyone is generally [[population registration in Sweden|registered with a home address]]. Normally, a voter should vote on the election day in the specified polling station, but everyone can vote during the last week at an early polling station, anywhere in the country, usually municipality-owned places like libraries.

Also, on election day, some polling places are open, even though the election day is always on Sunday. In hospitals and homes for the elderly, there are special voting opportunities. In elections until 1998, [[Posten (Sweden)|post offices]] were used for several decades as early voting stations (post offices now belong to a commercial company and are no longer nationally administered). Swedes living abroad must register their address and can vote at embassies or through mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.val.se/in_english/general_information/voting/index.html Valmyndigheten: Voting] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023114808/http://www.val.se/in_english/general_information/voting/index.html |date=2012-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early votes are transported to the voter's polling station in double envelopes. On election day, a voter can vote at the polling station. Before the early vote is counted, officials check if the voter has voted at the polling station. If that is the case, the vote is destroyed, with the inner envelope unopened. Early votes that do not reach the polling station in time are transported to the [[County Administrative Boards of Sweden|County Administrative Board]] and counted if the voter has not already voted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.val.se/det_svenska_valsystemet/rostning/fortidsrosta/index.html Valmyndigheten: Förtidsrösta i Sverige]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Switzerland ==
{{main|Voting in Switzerland}}
Swiss federal law allows [[postal voting]] in all federal elections and referenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite swiss law|sr=161.1|link=161_1|art=8|en=Federal Statute on Political Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all [[Swiss cantons|cantons]] allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail a few weeks before the election or referendum. They may cast it at a polling station on election day or mail it back at any prior time.

== Thailand ==
In [[Thailand]], early voting is known as ''เลือกตั้งล่วงหน้า'' (advance voting). It has been available since the [[1997 Constitution of Thailand]] and is offered both inside and outside the [[constituency]], especially for migrant workers and students, to all voters at central [[polling place]]s, mostly at the registered district offices, for [[House of Representatives of Thailand]] elections and [[referendums]].

Eligible voters are required to [[Voter registration|register]] at district offices and receive a reply notification. For advance voting outside the constituency, voters must register not less than 30 days before election day unless the voter has registered for the latest election. Voters who would like to go back and vote at their original constituency (according to house registration) must apply for register cancellation.

Thais living abroad may also register at embassies or consulates and vote through mail or at the embassies or consulates prior to election day.

Early voting day is the same as election day: voters must be carrying proof of identity, but it may be expired. The [[Election Commission (Thailand)|Election Commission]] uses [[post offices]] to send constituency ballots from other constituencies and abroad to original constituencies. They will be counted with election day constituency ballots. 
 
Early voting in the [[Thai general election, 2011]] was arranged on a Sunday (26 June 2011) while prior elections were arranged on both Saturday and Sunday. Around 2.6 million people, including 1.07 million in [[Bangkok]] turned up to vote, however, many potential voters were unable to vote because of large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Large crowds for advance voting |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2011/06/27/national/Large-crowds-for-advance-voting-30158762.html |location=Bangkok |newspaper=The Nation (Thailand) |date=27 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809193901/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2011/06/27/national/Large-crowds-for-advance-voting-30158762.html |archivedate=9 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Voters who did not vote on early voting day still can vote at their original constituencies on election day.

Early voting is similar to "no-excuse" absentee voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desilver|first1=Drew|last2=Geiger|first2=Abigail|title=For many Americans, Election Day is already here|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/21/for-many-americans-election-day-is-already-here/|website=www.pewresearch.org|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many U.S. states the period varies between four and fifty days prior to Election Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Daniel|title=These Are the States That Allow You to Vote Early|url=http://time.com/4495435/early-voting-states/|website=www.time.com|publisher=Time Magazine|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early voting in person is allowed without excuse required in 33 [[U.S. state]]s and in the [[District of Columbia]] (DC). Absentee voting by mail without excuse is allowed in 27 states and DC. In 20 states, an excuse is required. No-excuse permanent absentee voting is allowed in 6 states and in DC, and 3 states ([[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Colorado]]) conduct all early voting by mail.&lt;ref name="ncsl-ae"&gt;[http://www.ncsl.org/legislatures-elections/elections/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx Absentee and Early Voting].

===District of Columbia===
[[File:Absentee voting sign, Fairfax County, Virginia.jpg|thumb|upright|Sign indicating an early/absentee voting station in Fairfax County, Virginia]]
The [[District of Columbia]] required an excuse for early voting and absentee voting until its primary election on September 14, 2010. Early voting for the DC primary began on August 30, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;See DC ST § 1-1001.09, searchable link at {{cite web |url=http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/dcofficialcode |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927073923/http://www.dccouncil.washington.dc.us/dcofficialcode |archivedate=2010-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
[[Florida]] officially began early voting in 2004 as reflected in statute 101.657 f.s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%2520Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=101.657&amp;URL=CH0101/Sec657.HTM|title=Statutes &amp; Constitution         :View Statutes       :        Online Sunshine|website=www.leg.state.fl.us|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turnout for early voting exceeded a million in 2004. There were some problems: first day [[computer]] failures in [[Orange County, Florida|Orange County]] and [[Broward County]]; accidentally erased votes in [[Volusia County]]; and a lack of early voting sites in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]].  Reforms are being discussed to address the known issues as well as possibly eliminating the standard poll in favor of modified early voting.

In 2016 early voting requests increased 77% in Florida among Hispanic-Americans compared to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/06/hillary-clinton-early-voting-us-2016-election&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia===
{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} In [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], "early voting" and "advance voting" have two different meanings. Voting a week early is called "advance" voting and is typically available at several locations in urban and suburban counties. Voting well in advance, up to 45 days before election day, is called "early" voting and is normally available only at [[list of counties in Georgia|the 159 county]] election offices (where "advance" voting is also available). There is no voting the day before election day.

===Maryland===
[[File:Early voting at Bauer Drive Community Recreation Center.jpg|thumb|right|Early voting in Rockville, Maryland]]
In August 2006, a judge ruled in favor of several plaintiffs that the state constitution permitted voting only on the day of the election.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} The plaintiffs were challenging a new early-voting law on the probability of [[fraud]]. [[Absentee ballot]]s appear to remain acceptable for the time being.

Voters approved a constitutional amendment in November 2008 to allow early voting, starting with the primary elections in 2010. Maryland now offers both early voting in person and absentee voting by mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.state.md.us/voting/early_voting.html |title=Early Voting |publisher=Elections.state.md.us |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
Early voting was first used in Massachusetts for the [[Massachusetts general election, 2016|general election of November 2016]], where voters could cast ballots during the October 24 to November 4 timeframe. Over a million ballots were cast, with 22% of registered voters in the state taking advantage of early voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sec.state.ma.us/ele/ele16/early-voting_16/ev16idx.htm |title=2016 Early Voting Statistics |website=sec.state.ma.us |accessdate=November 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5644">'''Enantiodromia''' ({{lang-grc|ἐνάντιος,|enantios}} – opposite and δρόμος, ''dromos'' – running course) is a principle introduced in the West by [[psychiatrist]] [[Carl Jung]]. In [[Psychological Types]], Jung defines enantiodromia as "the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCkTAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=jung+psychological+types&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiEqebVuIPfAhVl9YMKHXudAysQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=enantiodromia&amp;f=false | title=Psychological Types | author=Jung, Carl | pages=426}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the principle of [[reflective equilibrium|equilibrium]] in the natural world, in that any extreme is opposed by the system in order to restore [[Balance (metaphysics)|balance]]. When things get to their extreme, they turn into their opposite.  However, in Jungian terms, a thing psychically [[Transmogrification|transmogrifies]] into its [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] opposite, in the repression of psychic forces that are thereby [[Cathexis|cathected]] into something powerful and threatening.  This principle was explicitly understood and discussed in the principles of traditional Chinese religion – as in [[Taoism]] and [[Yin and yang|yin-yang]]. A central premise of the [[I Ching]] is that yang lines become yin when they have reached their extreme, and vice versa. [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BeE7i26Fn_YC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=i+ching+extremes+become+opposite&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_wxU269xOg&amp;sig=NFgka5REs3WWWlKFPD_HFoXwI2k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwienazAqJ7cAhWmJMAKHWvJC9QQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=i%20ching%20extremes%20become%20opposite&amp;f=false]

==Overview==
The word "enantiodromia" was apparently coined by [[Stobaeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Stobaeus]]: Eclogarum, Physicarum et ethicarum: pp.[https://archive.org/details/ioannisstobaeie01meingoog] (Libri duo, Vol 1, 60)&lt;/ref&gt; but the concept is implied also in [[Heraclitus]]'s writings. In fr. 126, for example, Heraclitus says "cold things warm, warm things cool, wet things dry and parched things get wet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://philoctetes.free.fr/heraclitefraneng.htm Heraclitus discourse. Copyright © Samuel Béreau]&lt;/ref&gt; It also seems implicit in other of his sayings, like "war is father of all, king of all" (fr. 53), "they do not know that the differing/opposed thing agrees with itself; harmony is reflexive (παλίντροπος ''palintropos'', used of a compound bow, or "in reflexive tension"), like the bow and the lyre" (fr. 51). In these passages and others the idea of the [[Unity of opposites|coincidence of opposites]] is clearly articulated in Heraclitus' characteristic riddling style, as well as the dynamic motion back and forth between the two, generated especially by opposition and conflict.

Roughly a generation later, [[Plato]] in the ''[[Phaedo]]'' will articulate the principle clearly: "Everything arises in this way, opposites from their opposites." (sect. 71a).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0170:text%3DPhaedo:section%3D71a Plato, Phaedo, §57a, §71a]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Jung's modern recognition of it many centuries later, it has been actively portrayed in modern culture. For example, it has been applied to the subject of the film ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', to show how one devoted to a communist regime breaks through his loyalty and emerges a humanist.

In particular, Jung used the term to refer to the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] acting against the wishes of the [[conscious]] [[mind]], updating the Greek concept of [[akrasia]] in modern psychological terms. (''Aspects of the Masculine'', chapter 7, paragraph 294).

&lt;blockquote&gt;Enantiodromia. Literally, "running counter to," referring to the emergence of the unconscious opposite in the course of time. 
This characteristic phenomenon practically always occurs when an extreme, one-sided tendency dominates conscious life; in time an equally powerful counterposition is built up, which first inhibits the conscious performance and subsequently breaks through the conscious control. ("Definitions," ''ibid.'', par. 709)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Enantiodromia is typically experienced in conjunction with symptoms associated with acute [[neurosis]], and often foreshadows a rebirth of the personality. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The grand plan on which the unconscious life of the psyche is constructed is so inaccessible to our understanding that we can never know what evil may not be necessary in order to produce good by enantiodromia, and what good may very possibly lead to evil. ("The Phenomenology of the Spirit in Fairytales", ''Collected Works 9i'', par. 397)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Enantiodromia also refers to the process whereby one seeks out and embraces an opposing quality from within, internalizing it in a way that results in individual wholeness. This process is the crux of Jung's notion called the "path of individuation." One must incorporate an opposing archetype into their psyche to obtain a state of internal 'completion.'

'''''Family of Saltimbanques''''' (''{{lang|fr|La famille de saltimbanques}}'') is a 1905 painting by [[Pablo Picasso]]. The work depicts six [[:wikt:saltimbanco|saltimbanques]], a kind of itinerant [[circus performer]], in a desolate landscape.

It is considered the masterpiece of [[Picasso's Rose Period]], sometimes called his circus period.&lt;ref name="ngaguide"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/picteach.shtm Picasso: The Early Years, 1892–1906.] [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation and composition==
It was painted during a period from late 1904 to early 1906 when Picasso explored themes using the saltimbanque. Picasso frequently attended the [[Cirque Médrano]] in [[Montmartre]].

The composition groups the saltimbanques together but they seem disconnected and do not look at one another.&lt;ref name="life"&gt;Staff report (October 13, 1947). Picasso: The brilliant Spaniard is this era's most important painter. But is he a truly great artist? ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' &lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Critics have suggested ''Family of Saltimbanques'' is a covert group portrait of Picasso and his circle, symbolized as poor, independent and isolated. The painting was removed from the Spanish salon at the [[IX Biennale of Venice]] in 1910, because considered inappropriate by the organization. &lt;ref name=""&gt;Carmean E. A. (1970). ''Picasso, The saltimbanques.'' [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bohemian–Austrian poet [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] (1875–1926) was inspired by this painting as he wrote the fifth of ten elegies in his ''[[Duino Elegies]]'' (1923).  Rilke used the figures in Picasso's painting as a symbol of "human activity ... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented." Further, although Picasso's painting depicts the figures in a desolate desert landscape,  Rilke described them as standing on a "threadbare carpet" to suggest "the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will...before their 'pure too-little; had passed into 'empty too-much'."&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. B.; and Spender, Stephen. ''Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies'' (New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 1939) 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A related work in [[gouache]] and [[pastel]] is ''Family of Acrobats'' (1905).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.picasso-paintings.org/family-of-acrobats-study-1905-by-pablo-picasso/ Picasso-paintings.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Free Market Fairness''''' is a 2012 book of [[political philosophy]] written by [[John Tomasi]], a Professor of Political Philosophy at [[Brown University]]. Tomasi presents the concept of "free market fairness" or "market democracy," a middle ground between [[Friedrich Hayek]] and [[John Rawls]]'s ideas. The book was widely reviewed.

==Content==
Tomasi looks at followers of [[Friedrich Hayek]] on the right and [[John Rawls]] on the left, only to conclude that both views are not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs"&gt;Richard N. Cooper, [http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138281/john-tomasi/free-market-fairness Free Market Fairness], ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', November/December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Taken together, they can lead to "free market fairness" or "market democracy," whereby the government is not prescriptive, but makes sure opportunities are available to all.&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cato.org/events/free-market-fairness Free Market Fairness], [[Cato Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomasi's [[fusionist]]-inspired project combines a foundational commitment to social justice with a foundational commitment to private economic liberty. Tomasi calls this hybrid "market democracy" and he holds it up as a moral rival to familiar conceptions of social democratic justice. "Free Market Fairness" is a leading text of the movement known as "Bleeding Heart Libertarianism," which seeks to combine a commitment to economic liberty with a commitment to social justice.

==Critical reception==
Writing for ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Adam Wolfson suggested, "Mr. Tomasi's book is emphatically a work of political theory, not a blueprint for political action, much less a catalog of policy solutions."&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;Adam Wolfson, [https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304724404577291591833180250 Occupy Common Ground], ''The Wall Street Journal'', March 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the peer-reviewed academic journal "Political Theory," Elizabeth Anderson describes "Free Market Fairness" as launching "a major research program - Market Democracy." Anderson writes, "market democracy offers a refreshing change from stale debates within libertarian and high liberal ideal theory. Tomasi is right to stress that the economy is an important domain of liberty wrongly denigrated by high liberals, as distributive justice has been wrongly denigrated by libertarians."&lt;ref&gt;Political Theory 41 (1):163-166 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In a review in the European journal "Res Publica," Alan Thomas calls Free Market Fairness "a landmark publication in political philosophy." Thomas writes "It deserves many readers for its clarity, intelligence, openness to the ideas of others and yet insistence that the classically liberal tradition deserves to be represented alongside the standard options in recent political philosophy."&lt;ref&gt; Res Publica (2013) 12:381-385&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''[[The Financial Times]]'', [[Samuel Brittan]] criticized this, adding, "Unfortunately the book does not live up to its splendid introduction."&lt;ref name="financialtimes"&gt;Samuel Brittan, [http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/83f15422-9528-11e1-ad38-00144feab49a.html#axzz3GPXWD3f6 Free Market Fairness], ''The Financial Times'', May 6, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded, "Tomasi describes free-market fairness as a research programme rather than a fixed dogma. There is clearly a lot more to research."&lt;ref name="financialtimes"/&gt;

In ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', Andrew Koppelman, a Professor of Law at [[Northwestern University]], suggested, "Tomasi's book is a useful corrective to both Rawls and Hayek."&lt;ref name="notredame"&gt;Andrew Koppelman, [https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/30638-free-market-fairness/ Book review: Free Market Fairness], ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', May 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, he argued that Tomasi's ideas were at times unrealistic, warning, "Ideals can be dangerous if too far removed from the realities of human life."&lt;ref name="notredame"/&gt; Similarly, ''[[The Boston Review]]'' published a nuanced review, commenting, "The book is written in a friendly, relaxed tone," but adding that his arguments were not "persuasive."&lt;ref name="bostonreview"&gt;Martin O'Neill, Thad Williamson, [http://www.bostonreview.net/books-ideas/free-market-fairness Free Market Fairness], ''The Boston Review'', November 5, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded by disagreeing with Tomasi, concluding, "The moral goods of exercising freedom through market activities would be more widely realized under a regime of Rawlsian property-owning democracy than under the sort of minimally regulated capitalism that Tomasi celebrates."&lt;ref name="bostonreview"/&gt;

In the peer-reviewed academic journal ''[[Critical Review (journal)|Critical Review: A Journal of Politics and Society]]'', [[Mark Pennington]], a Professor of Political Economy at [[King's College, London]] suggests the book "offers a challenging and innovative case for classical liberalism."&lt;ref name="markpennington"&gt;Mark Pennington, [Realistic Idealism and Classical Liberalism: Evaluating Free Market Fairness], ''Critical Review: A Journal of Politics and Society'', 08 Oct 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In another peer-reviewed academic journal, ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', Eric MacGilvray, a Professor of Political Science at [[Ohio State University]] offered a similarly positive review, starting with "I find a lot to praise in Free Market Fairness."&lt;ref name="journalofpolitics"&gt;Eric MacGilvray, [http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8878710], ''The Journal of Politics'', Volume 75, Issue 02, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to critique Tomasi's use of the word "libertarian" as both pro-free market and "high liberal."&lt;ref name="journalofpolitics"/&gt; Moreover, in ''[[The Mises Review]]'', the journal of the libertarian think tank [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]], [[David Gordon (philosopher)|David Gordon]] praised the book, adding "every reader of his book will learn a great deal from it."&lt;ref name="misesreview"&gt;David Gordon, [https://mises.org/misesreview_detail.aspx?control=378 Free Market Fairness], ''Mises Review'', Volume 18, Number 1, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical Symposia on Free Market Fairness have been hosted by "Bleeding Heart Libertarianism" (bleedingheartlibertarianism.com). The Journal of Politics, Critical Review, and Res Publica.

"'''Geek girl'''" is a 20th-century term, signifying a gendered subgenre within the modern [[geek]] subculture.

== History ==
The return of the word "geek" in the mid-1990s can be traced to the popularization of workplace computing and the Internet and the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1995–2000. The early days of the [[Geek#Reclamation_and_self-identification|reclaimed use of "geek"]] were strongly associated with computers and information technology&lt;ref&gt;"geek, ''n.''. 1.c. "spec. A person who is extremely devoted to and knowledgeable about computers or related technology." ''Oxford English Dictionary'': http://www.oed.com.&lt;/ref&gt; and the majority of practitioners were male.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Feineman's ''Geek Chic: The Ultimate Guide to Geek Culture'' ({{ISBN|1584232056}}), both noted "the increasing power of women in the geek world" and, at the time of publication (1995), characterized the book's research as "an exercise in machismo. The women were hard to find" (17).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a 1996 study of high school cultures, linguist [[Mary Bucholtz]] noted that "nerd status is overwhelmingly associated with males"&lt;ref&gt;Bucholtz, Mary. "Geek the Girl: Language, Femininity, and Female Nerds". ''Gender and Belief Systems''. Proceedings of the Fourth Berkeley Women and Language Conference. Ed. Natasha Warner, Jocelyn Ahlers, Leela Bilmes, Monica Oliver, Suzanne Wertheim and Melinda Chen. Berkeley: University of California, 1996. 119-131.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two studies by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) quantified the gap between men and women in computing and the continuing problems recruiting and retaining female programmers.&lt;ref&gt;"Women in Computing: Where Are We Now?" Klawe, Maria and Nancy Leveson. ''Communications of the ACM - Inspiring Women in Computing'' Volume 38.1: 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klawe, Maria, Telle Whitney and Caroline Simard. "Women in Computing, Take 2" ''Communications of the ACM - Inspiring Women in Computing'' Volume 52.2: 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "Geekgirl" was coined by [[Rosie Cross]] in 1993 as the title of her online [[cyberfeminist]] magazine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geekgirl.com.au&lt;/ref&gt; This is Australia's longest running online publication and in September 1996 it was exhibited at the New Museum of Contemporary Art New York. Editions of this magazine from the mid 90's have been preserved by the Internet Archive.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/*/geekgirl.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;
As the use of the personal computer grew during the mid-to-late 2000s, the number of [[women in computing]] rose proportionately, and networks were created to provide support and connection for self-described "geek girls". GirlGeeks.org &lt;ref&gt;Official website, http://www.girlgeeks.org/. Accessed May 11th, 2011 at 10:55 am.&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 1999 to serve as "the source for women in computing",&lt;ref&gt;"History of GirlGeeks": http://www.girlgeeks.org/about/history.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2005 [[Girl Geek Dinners]] was formed to connect women in the [[information technology (IT)]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;Geek Girl Dinners: http://girlgeekdinners.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread recognition of "geek girls" as a community occurred in summer 2010, when the annual [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] included a panel entitled "Geek Girls Exist".&lt;ref&gt;Comic-Con 2010 schedule: http://www.comic-con.org/cci2010/cci10_prog_thu.php. Accessed on May 9th, 2011 at 9:41 pm. EST.&lt;/ref&gt; Panelists included StarWars.com journalist [[Bonnie Burton]], singer-songwriter [[Marian Call]], [[Tekzilla]] and [[Qore (PlayStation Network)|Qore]] host [[Veronica Belmont]], [[MythBusters]] featured host [[Kari Byron]], and was hosted by [[Kristin Rielly]], founder of Geek Girls Network. The panel's popularity&lt;ref&gt;"SDCC Recap: Geek Girls Exist Panel": http://geekgirlsnetwork.com/blog/2010/08/sdcc-recap-geek-girls-exist-panel/#more-1902. Accessed on May 9th, 2011 at 10:01 pm. EST&lt;/ref&gt; has been credited as a primary mover in solidifying the girl geek concept.

== Types ==
The term geek girl is in some ways fractured between its technical and cultural uses.  The strongest association remains with computing, IT, and engineering. Practicing "geek girls" then include video game executive [[Jade Raymond]], computer scientist and Yahoo! CEO [[Marissa Mayer]], social media developer [[Leah Culver]], and engineer [[Limor Fried]] of [[Adafruit Industries]].

"Geek girl" is also a term applied to women who engage in journalism and media about technology, typically through the Internet rather than traditional print media, such as tech journalist [[Natali Morris]].  Perhaps the most well-known variety of the "geek girl" is the [[gamer]], who typically engages in video and/or live [[role-playing games]].  In 2007, actress and gamer [[Felicia Day]] popularized the archetype through the webseries ''[[The Guild (web series)|The Guild]]'' and the YouTube viral video "[[(Do You Wanna Date My) Avatar]]".

=== Fake geek girl === 
"Fake geek girl" is a [[pejorative]] term for a woman who is accused of feigning interest in [[geek]]y topics such as video games or comic books to get attention from men.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dear Fake Geek Girls: Please Go Away|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/tarabrown/2012/03/26/dear-fake-geek-girls-please-go-away/#772519782afb|website = Forbes|access-date = |first = Tara Tiger|last = Brown|date = 26 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topic was the subject of controversy in 2012 and 2013, when multiple articles were published supporting or condemning the concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Fake Geek Girls' Paranoia Is About Male Insecurity, Not Female Duplicity|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/fake-geek-girls-paranoia-is-about-male-insecurity-not-female-duplicity/267402/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = |language = en-US|first = Noah|last = Berlatsky|date = 22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://reagle.org/joseph/2014/fake/fake.html|title = Geek Policing: Fake Geek Girls and Contested Attention|last = Reagle|first = Joseph|date = 5 August 2015|journal = International Journal of Communication|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |volume = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the controversy surrounding the concept of fake geek girls began in March 2012, when Tara Brown published an article on the ''[[Forbes]]'' website titled "Dear Fake Geek Girls: Please Go Away".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the article, she discussed the difference between geeky women as a social outcasts, and "pretentious females who have labeled themselves as a 'geek girl' [who have] figured out that guys will pay a lot of attention to them if they proclaim they are reading comics or playing video games."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Joe Peacock continued this criticism to discuss [[Promotional model|booth babes]] and female [[cosplay]]ers in a July 2012 blog post for [[CNN]] titled "Booth babes need not apply". In this article, he denounced women who pretend to be interested in geek culture to gain attention from men or to advance their [[Model (people)|modelling]] careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://geekout.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/24/booth-babes-need-not-apply/|title = Booth babes need not apply|last = Peacock|first = Joe|date = 24 July 2012|work = Geek Out!|publisher = [[CNN]]|accessdate = 27 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic artist [[Tony Harris (artist)|Tony Harris]] wrote a Facebook post in November 2012, described by ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' as a "diatribe", about female cosplayers who were not knowledgeable about the characters they were representing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sexist rants against "fake geek girls" hit new low|url = http://www.dailydot.com/news/tony-harris-peacock-fake-geek-girls-cosplayers/|website = The Daily Dot|access-date = |last = Romano|first = Aja|date = 13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criticism of fake geek girls has given rise to other phenomena, such as the "Idiot Nerd Girl" [[image macro]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Taking Back a Meme: Idiot Nerd Girl|url = http://www.thewire.com/national/2012/09/taking-back-meme-idiot-nerd-girl/56674/|website = The Wire|access-date = 2016-02-12|language = en-US|last = Zuckerman|first = Esther|date = 10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These articles prompted considerable response. Some people argued that fake geek girls did not exist, or were more rare than the criticism suggested. Kirk Hamilton wrote in ''[[Kotaku]]'' that people perceived to be fake geek girls simply had interests that varied, in aspect or degree, from those of a male reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Fake Threat of Fake Geek Girls|url = http://kotaku.com/5896920/the-fake-threat-of-fake-geek-girls|website = Kotaku|access-date = 2016-02-11|language = en-US|first = Kirk|last = Hamilton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some responses describe the criticism as [[Misogyny|misogynist]] and as a form of [[Gatekeeper|gatekeeping]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Fake Geek Girls': How Geek Gatekeeping Is Bad For Business|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnyegriffiths/2012/07/26/fake-geek-girls-gamer-edition/3/#241a8d082b01|access-date = 2016-02-11|last = Griffiths|first = Daniel Nye|date = 26 July 2012|publisher = Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent developments ==
In September 2010, the geek girl group [[Team Unicorn]] was formed by four "gamer girls", who produced the YouTube video "G33k &amp; G4m3r Girls" as a parody of the song [[California Gurls]] by Katy Perry. The video went viral within a week,&lt;ref&gt;Interview, "G33K &amp; G4M3R GIRLS (Geek and Gamer Girls Video) 1 Week, 1 Million Views": http://actionflickchick.com/superaction/g33k-g4m3r-girls-interview/.  Accessed on May 11th, 2011 at 2:10 pm. EST.&lt;/ref&gt; but the name of the group was intended to reflect the invisible status of women in the geek subculture: "Geek Girls: Like unicorns, we're not supposed to exist."

In late 2010, the [[Seattle]]-based non-profit GeekGirlCon announced that it would hold the first conference devoted to geek girls on October 8–9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;"Welcome to Geek Girl Con": http://www.geekgirlcon.com/welcome-to-geek-girl-con/. Accessed on May 9th, 2011 at 10:34 EST.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the New York Times' television reviewer [[Ginia Bellefante]] caused a minor uproar by characterizing the medieval-fantasy series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' as "boy fiction" that "no woman alive" would wish to watch.&lt;ref&gt;Television review, "'Game of Thrones': A Fantasy World of Strange Feuding Kingdoms." http://tv.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/television/game-of-thrones-begins-sunday-on-hbo-review.html?pagewanted=print. Accessed on May 11th, 2011 at 9:50 am.&lt;/ref&gt; The review prompted a direct response from GeekGirlCon,&lt;ref&gt;"GeekGirlCon Responds to the NY Times and Bellafante’s Review of Game of Thrones": http://www.geekgirlcon.com/geekgirlcon-responds-to-the-ny-times-and-bellafantes-review-of-game-of-thrones/.

From around 450, Athenian funerary monuments increasingly depicted women, as their civic importance increased.]]

The '''Grave Stele of Hegeso''', most likely sculpted by [[Callimachus (sculptor)|Callimachus]], is renowned as one of the finest Attic [[stele|grave stelae]] surviving (mostly intact) today. Dated from ca. 410 - ca. 400 BCE,&lt;ref name=mec&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ficus.pntic.mec.es/~wque0012/filantigua/presocraticos/03_recursos.htm |title=Periodo presocrático |publisher=[[Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte]] |access-date=28 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621135633/http://ficus.pntic.mec.es/~wque0012/filantigua/presocraticos/03_recursos.htm |archive-date=21 June 2013 |work=Instituto Nacional de Tecnologías Educativas y de Formación del Profesorado}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is made entirely of [[Pentelic marble]]. It stands 1.49m high and .92m wide, in the form of a ''[[naiskos]]'', with pilasters and a [[pediment]] featuring [[palmette]] [[Acroterion|acroteria]].  The relief, currently on display at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] in [[Athens]]&lt;ref name=mec/&gt; (NAMA 3624) was found in 1870 in the [[Kerameikos]] in Athens, which now houses a replica of it.
[[File:Kerameikos Tombs.jpg|thumb|Modern replicas of the burial monuments for Hegeso, daughter of Proxenios, and for Koroibos.]] In its current condition, it is almost complete, but has been restored around its edges. The [[plinth]] has mostly broken off and there is slight damage on the head of Hegeso.

The main shows a mature Athenian woman (Hegeso) wearing a [[chiton]] and [[himation]], seated on a chair with her feet resting on an elaborate footstool. In her left hand, she holds an open ''[[pyxis (vessel)|pyxis]]'', and in her right she holds a piece of (missing) jewelry that was originally painted, at which she is directing her gaze. Opposite her, on the left, stands a maidservant wearing a tunic and a headdress described as either a snood or ''[[sakkos]]''. The maidservant is presenting the ''pyxis'', on the knees of Hegeso. On the [[Architrave|epistyle]] there is an epitaph, ΗΓΗΣΩ ΠΡΟΞΕΝΟ, stating that the deceased is Hegeso, daughter of Proxenios.

In general, stelae can be seen as a retrospective funerary art, that typically articulate a society's ideals of social living through their depiction of a [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]].&lt;ref name="Leader"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leader|first=R.E.|title=In death not divided: gender, family, and state on classical Athenian grave stelae|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=1997|volume=101|issue=4|pages=683–699|doi=10.2307/506830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other non-civic art of the ''oikos'' (home), such as non-funerary red-figure painted pottery, stelae were obviously more fixed/permanent monuments, displayed outdoors for public viewing, and are constructed by a family for a specific person, making them far more expensive and exclusive than pottery.&lt;ref name="Leader" /&gt; While their medium, context, and style associate stelae with the ''polis'' (city), their iconography is of the ''oikos''. This paradox, as well as the prominence of women on gravestones, has led many scholars to focus on an analysis of the virtues designated to different genders on the stelae.

== Layout of cemetery / Historical Context ==

During the early fifth century BCE, Athenians adopted a simpler style of tomb markers and there was a sharp decline in the amount of difference in wealth between individuals or families, reflected by grave goods. Death had a unifying factor (with every social class represented equally in burial) up until the beginning of the [[w:Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]] in 431. Around this time, sculptors once again began creating grave monuments with considerable skill and quality. Periboloi, or family grave enclosures, were used more often in the fourth century to emphasize sentiments of democracy and family ideals/values. However, these ostentatious representations ended abruptly in 317, when [[w:Demetrius of Phalerum|Demetrios of Phaleron]] banned any more elaborate mausolea.&lt;ref name="Whitley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Whitley|first=J.|title=The Archaeology of Ancient Greece|date=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A peribolos tomb has a high wall facing onto a road, which essentially retains the earth fill piled behind it. The front wall is far higher than the three rubble walls surrounding the rectangular burial area, which contain the graves and provide space for family gatherings at funerals or other celebrations for the dead. Since people on the street could only view the front wall, families often created a facade of careful and elaborate masonry work, also shown in the reliefs of the funerary markers that would face the street in a row above, just behind the front wall. From the interior of the plot, one could only see the roughly cut backs of the stelae. Closterman has analyzed the iconography from classical Athenian tombstones within the periboloi plots, and found that these stelae most often do not focus on representing dead individuals, but rather display "the ideal roles of the family in the context of the civic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Closterman|first=W.|title=Family ideology and family history: the function of funerary markers in Classical Attic peribolos tombs.|date=2007|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=111|issue=4|page=635|doi=10.3764/aja.111.4.633}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

As one can see from the modern replica in the Kerameikos, the monument of Hegeso would have been viewed within a peribolos tomb, facing the Street of Tombs on the left of the stele for Koroibos of Melite, a [[deme]] in the west of Athens. Though his rosette stele only lists Koroibos, his sons, and grandson (up to possibly five generations) in the inscription, most label Hegeso as the wife of Koroibos. The ambiguity in the inscription and depiction could also have been purposeful, so that Hegeso could memorialize not just one woman, but instead represent the qualities of all the unnamed wives of male descendants from the Koroibos stele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Closterman|first=W.|title=Family ideology and family history: the function of funerary markers in Classical Attic peribolos tombs.|date=2007|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=111|issue=4|pages=633–652|doi=10.3764/aja.111.4.633}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Athenians measured the level of public responsibility a citizen felt for the polis by his private actions, a citizen would feel motivated to create stelae in periboloi (like that of Hegeso) in order to convey persistent care for family members by displaying them together in a row, connecting numerous generations. Furthermore, the size and quality of Hegeso's stele indicate that her family was more wealthy and important than most.&lt;ref name=burton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burton|first=D.|title=Public memorials, private virtues: women on classical Athenian grave monuments|journal=Mortality|date=2003|volume=8|issue=1|pages=20–35|doi=10.1080/1357627021000063106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The relief ==

While Hegeso's relief may show a purely domestic scene, the virtues it honors may not have been solely for private consumption. Rather than simply celebrating the individual lives of certain women, the presence of stelae similar to that of Hegeso serve to define the female within a recognized social framework.&lt;ref name=" burton" /&gt; From 450 BCE on, Athenian citizens (men) had a much greater vested interest in displaying his mother's status, in part due to the law by Pericles stating that any Athenian citizen needed to have a mother who was the daughter of another citizen. This law gave more importance to the child-bearing role of women (since their children would later select the gravestones) as well as the importance of marriage and familial relationships, since marrying non-Athenian women was so discouraged. While Pericles' citizenship law did not exactly change anything in terms of women's roles or freedoms, it codified their place in the hierarchy of the entire polis, which could be the underlying motive for Athenians during this time to represent such private, family virtues on publicly viewed stelae&lt;ref name=" burton" /&gt;

=== Hegeso ===

==== Physical Appearance ====

Hegeso's chiton and himation are transparent, but do not cling to her with any sort of erotic suggestiveness.&lt;ref name=" Whitley" /&gt; She has short hair that is tied in a sakkos or snood. This elaborate hairstyle, drawing on a Pheidian model for Aphrodite,&lt;ref name="diana" /&gt; shows her superiority to her maidservant, who has a simpler hairstyle. Both Hegeso's clothing and hair emphasize her youthful beauty and sexuality&lt;ref name=" burton" /&gt;

==== Position ====

While the seated position of Hegeso was most likely intended to be a naturalistic depiction of a domestic setting, it actually refers to the widespread custom of ancestor worship, where a mortal who has died transforms into a lower-world god to his descendants.&lt;ref name=Verrall&gt;{{cite book|last=Verrall|first=M.G.|title=Mythology &amp; Monuments of Ancient Athens: Being a Translation of a Portion of the 'Attica' of Pausanias|date=1890|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|author2=Harrison, J.E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Hegeso could be seen as a goddess and her maidservant as an approaching worshipper with an offering of the pyxis. In other, similar reliefs, the heir is a servant of the past and could be worshipped in a variety of ways, whether with a pathetic procession, a crouching dog, or by a votive bird.&lt;ref name=" Verrall" /&gt; The similarities of all of these images indicate a common theme of ancestor worship. However, the tradition has a Peloponnesian origin, which further suggests that the Athenian sculptor would not have intended any such analogy&lt;ref name=" Verrall" /&gt;

=== Maidservant ===

Hegeso's maidservant stands as a symbol of Hegeso's status and freedom, and the two are contrasted by how much more elaborate in style Hegeso's hair and clothing (with more folds) are. Long-sleeved chiton garments were not uncommon for servants in Greek sculpture or vase paintings. According to Barker,&lt;ref name=barker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=A.W.|title=The costume of the servant on the grave-relief of Hegeso|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=1924|volume=28|issue=3|pages=290–292|doi=10.2307/497745}}&lt;/ref&gt; though, Hegeso's maidservant appears to be wearing two chitons together, one of which has a longer sleeve of finer texture and passes through the arm-size of the outer garment.

=== Objects ===

==== Furniture ====

Hegeso is seated on a chair that appears almost too slender to be firm, and places her sandalled feet on the delicate footstool in front of her.&lt;ref name=carpenter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=R.|title=Tradition and invention in Attic reliefs|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=1950|volume=54|issue=4|pages=323–336|doi=10.2307/501004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Footstools, especially ones shown as artistically as this, could be seen as a sign of rank in Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name=mitchell&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.M.W.|title=A History of Ancient Sculpture|date=1905|publisher=Dodd, Mead, &amp; Co.|location=New York|pages=499–501}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Burton&lt;ref name=" burton" /&gt; notes, the presence of chairs do not necessarily indicate a domestic setting, but definitely an interior one. However, coupled with the footstool, which further accentuates Hegeso's wealth, the furniture in the scene points to a domestic scene and seems to honor private virtues in the ''oikos''.

==== Pyxis ====

The container Hegeso holds is of a type typically associated with women and weddings (as a gift for the bride).

==== Jewelry ====

Probably the most striking object in the relief is the item of jewelry that Hegeso appears to be pulling from the pyxis, since both she and her maidservant seem almost transfixed by it. The fact that it is missing now only makes one focus more on the empty space and wonder what it actually looked like or may have represented. However, the artist was most likely not attempting to draw attention to the piece of jewelry, but rather the act of adornment itself. He would have wanted to express a purely domestic scene of Hegeso, a typical Athenian lady, dressing to go out or receive guests (not to leave the household permanently in death, as one may want to sentimentally interpret it).&lt;ref name="carpenter" /&gt;

Obviously, the stele showing a woman adorning herself stands in contrast to those depicting scenes of women's industry. The adornment theme could be related to the dowry that a woman's father would need to provide her with in order to marry.&lt;ref name="Leader" /&gt; In this way, the stele would demonstrate Hegeso's ability to contribute economically to her future ''oikos'' due to the nature of her attachment to her own family and its estate. Marriage is, after all, an important way for men to form links with each other within and outside of the ''polis''.&lt;ref name=" burton" /&gt; Therefore, an adornment scene would not only reflect a household's wealth and status, but would commemorate its ability to continue to help maintain the polis at large, in spite of individual death(s)&lt;ref name=" burton" /&gt;

== Style ==

The quiet contemplation evident in the figures of Hegeso and her maidservant was common in all grave reliefs of the fifth century BCE.&lt;ref name=diana&gt;{{cite book|last=Buitron-Oliver|first=Diana|title=The Greek Miracle: Classical Sculpture from the Dawn of the Democracy (the Fifth Century B.C.)|date=1992|publisher=The National Gallery of Art|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mitchell,&lt;ref name="mitchell" /&gt; this "mere shadow of emotion" reflects absence of individuality and is reminiscent of the Parthenon frieze in its expression. The characters are noble and beautiful, but absorbed without affection for the object at which they direct their gaze (presumably a piece of jewelry). However, Buitron-Oliver&lt;ref name="diana" /&gt; notes that the highly idealized figures on the Parthenon frieze gave way to more realistic drapery around 400 BCE, as seen in the Hegeso relief. These new trends led to classical sculpture, in which a "severe style" was common. During this early classical period, sculptors and painters endowed their works with a feeling of seriousness in order to portray a sense of ''[[sophrosyne]]''&lt;ref name="diana" /&gt;

The history of [[Mexican Americans]], Americans of Mexican descent, largely begins after the annexation of parts of Mexico in 1848, the nearly 80,000 individuals then living in the U.S. became full U.S. citizens. Large-scale new migration augmented their numbers during the 1910s, as Mexico was torn by a high-casualty civil war. Until the 1960s, most lived within a few hundred miles of the border, although some resettled along frail lines from the Southwest to the Midwest.
 
More recently, Mexican Americans have diffused throughout the U.S., especially in the Midwest and Southeast, with the largest numbers in California and Texas. In the past hundred years Mexican-Americans have campaigned for voting rights, stood against educational, employment, and ethnic discrimination and stood for economic and social advancement. At the same time many Mexican-Americans have struggled with defining and maintaining their community's identity. 
In the 1960s and 1970s, some Hispanic student groups flirted with [[nationalism]] and differences over the proper name for members of the community of [[Chicano|Chicano/Chicana]], Latino/Latina, Mexican-Americans, Hispanics or simply [[La Raza]] became tied up with deeper disagreements over whether to integrate into or remain separate from [[Anglo]] society, as well as divisions between those Mexican-Americans whose families had lived in the United States for two or more generations and more recent immigrants.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==Early history==
Communities of Spanish-speaking [[Tejanos]], [[Nuevomexicanos]], [[Californios]], [[Genízaro]]s and [[Mission Indians]] have existed in the American southwest since the area was part of [[New Spain]]'s ''[[Provincias Internas]]''. The majority of these historically Hispanophone populations eventually [[language shift|adopted English as their first language]] as part of their overall [[Americanization]].

==19th century==
When Mexico took over control from Spain in the early 1820s, the new government ignored and isolated the "norteños" (inhabitants of Mexico's northern provinces), except to break up the mission system in [[History of California|California]]. The systematic [[Navajo people|Navajo]] and [[Apache]] raids on [[History of New Mexico|New Mexico]] villages and ranches were ignored, as was the vulnerability of California, as the central government pulled back its soldiers to use them in recurrent civil wars and factional battles. After armed uprisings in [[Republic of Texas|Texas]] Mexico's President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] led an army to put down the rebellion. After initial victories at The Alamo and Goliad, Santa Anna was decisively defeated by the Texans, who declared independence. The Tejanos in Texas joined the revolution and supported the new Republic of Texas; The Hispanics in New Mexico and California were localistic and did not identify with the regime in Mexico City. The "norteños" played a minor role in the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48, and when offered the choice of repatriating to Mexico or remaining and becoming full citizens of the United States, the great majority remained. Only when large numbers of Americans arrived did they develop a sense of "lo mexicano," that is of "being Mexican," and that new identification had little to do with far-off Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;David G. Gutiérrez, "Migration, Emergent Ethnicity, and the "Third Space": The Shifting Politics of Nationalism in Greater Mexico" ''Journal of American History'' 1999 86(2): 481–517. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2567042 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; American entrepreneurs often cultivated alliances and partnerships with the Mexican propertied elites in the states of Texas and California, and the territories of New Mexico and Arizona. The Californios—who only numbered 10,000 in 1848, remained in California but were soon overwhelmed by the immigration of hundreds of thousands of newcomers to California, and largely became invisible to Anglos. The Latino culture of the rest of the Southwest, especially New Mexico and southern Texas, called itself "Spanish" (rather than "Mexican") to distinguish themselves from "los norteamericanos". The Latinos emphasized their own religion, language, customs and kinship ties, and drew into enclaves, rural colonies and urban barrios, which norteamericanos seldom entered; intermarriage rates were low.

Beginning in the 1820s, immigrants from the U.S. and Europe settled in Texas (Tejas), then part of Mexico. Anglo and Hispanic Texas joined to fight Mexico in 1836, defeating an invading army and declaring the independence of Texas. The Texas Republic included Tejanos as leading citizens, but Mexico refused to recognize its legal existence. The US annexed Texas in 1845, leading to the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–48. While there were some Americans who considered the war with Mexico illegal and immoral, others considered it part of [[Manifest Destiny]]—the American destiny to pursue the war. This policy claimed that it was the United States' right to expand westward across North America and settle the land.

The Americans won easily and the war ended with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. In the Treaty Mexico gave up more than 500,000 square miles of territory, which today comprises Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Utah, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. The United States in 1853 purchased the [[Gadsden Purchase]], a strip of land in southern New Mexico and Arizona that provided a route for a railroad.

The result was unchallenged American control over a wide range of territory once held by Mexico, including the present day states of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California. The vast majority of Hispanic populations chose to stay and become full US citizens. By and large, the Hispanic populations of these areas supported the new government. The Mexican government had become despotic under on-and-off-again President [[General Santa Anna]], and the US Government offered protection from Indian raids that Mexico had not prevented, meaning an end to civil wars of the sort that continuously wracked Mexico until 1920, and it promised much greater long-run prosperity.

Although the treaty promised that the landowners in this newly acquired territory would enjoy full enjoyment and protection of their property as if they were citizens of the United States, many former citizens of Mexico lost their claims in lawsuits before state and federal courts. Even those statutes intended to protect the owners of property at the time of the extension of the United States' borders, such as the 1851 California Land Act, had the effect of dispossessing [[Californio]] owners ruined by the cost of maintaining litigation over land titles for years.

After the Santa Fe Ring succeeded in dispossessing thousands of landholders in New Mexico, groups such as [[Las Gorras Blancas]] tore down fences or burned down interlopers' farm buildings. In western Texas the political struggle sparked an [[San Elizario Salt War|armed conflict]] in which the Tejano majority forced the surrender of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], but in the end lost their influence, offices, and economic opportunities.

In other areas, particularly California, the Hispanic residents were simply overwhelmed by the number of Anglo settlers who rushed in, first in Northern California as a result of the [[California Gold Rush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_coronel.html|title=American Experience - The Gold Rush - People &amp; Events - PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; then decades later by the boom in Southern California. Anglo miners drove Hispanic miners out of their camps, barred non-Anglos from testifying in court and imposed exclusionary standards similar to what was called [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in the case of African-Americans.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-111897839.html|title=Latinos facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about Latinos|website=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hispanics, of whom [[Joaquin Murietta|Joaquín Murieta]] was a legendary example and [[Tiburcio Vasquez|Tiburcio Vásquez]] a real one, responded by resorting to banditry. During the Gold Rush, there was an immigration of Mexican miners to California.

About 20,000 Tejanos lived in South Texas in the 1850s. The social structure has been analyzed by historian Randolph Campbell:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''South Texans of Hispanic descent lived in a three-tiered society during the antebellum years. At the top stood the landed elite, the owners of huge ranches, many of which originated as haciendas in the Spanish colonial period. The elite based their economic lives on cattle raising. They sold some cattle in Mexico and Louisiana and exported hides and tallow, but access to major urban markets outside the region was so limited that South Texas ranchers did not develop highly commercial operations during the antebellum years. This apparently suited most very well anyhow in that they viewed their ranches primarily as a way of life rather than a business investment and therefore focused on keeping their property intact as well as turning a profit....''&lt;ref&gt;Randolph Campbell, ''Gone to Texas: A History of the Lone Star State'' (2003) p 190-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Small landowners occupied the second rung of the South Texas economic and social ladder. These rancheros, as they were called, lived in one-room adobe houses and spent most of their time caring for their small herds of horses and cattle. Although a smaller part of the population, they can be compared, it seems, to the plain folk Anglos of East Texas. That is, they differed from the elite only in the extent of their property, not in their dependence on the land or the way they tried to live.

Finally, South Texas had a lower class composed primarily of peóns, vaqueros, and cartmen. Peóns had a status above that of the slaves in antebellum Texas but below that of genuinely free men. They owned no property, could not travel or call in a doctor without the permission of the estate owner (the patrón), and needed his approval for marriages. When a peón was accused of an offense, the patrón acted as judge and jury. On the other hand, peóns were not property and therefore could not be bought and sold or treated as personal chattels in any way. Somewhere in an ill-defined place between that of slaves and free men, they served as “faithful servants” to the upper class.

Peóns worked at the direction of the patróns—planting and harvesting crops, herding goats, digging wells, and doing any sort of manual labor necessary. In return they received wages or credits at the estate's store in amounts so small that they were constantly in debt. They lived in tiny one-room jacales, huts with walls of mud or any other material available and thatched roofs. The one room served for both living and sleeping; cooking and eating took place in a separate enclosure made of grass or corn stalks.

The poor, landless class also included vaqueros, the men who herded and took care of cattle. Ranch owners and mission priests generally considered it beneath their dignity to do such work and thought of these first Texas cowboys simply as laborers riding horses. No one involved could have imagined that millions of Americans would one day see working cattle as an ultimately romantic and heroic part of Texas's past. At least vaqueros, as befitted their future image, had more independence than peóns. They were not bound to the land and could even expect to acquire property of their own someday.

Cartmen lived in San Antonio or along the route from that city to Indianola and earned their living by transporting food and merchandise from the coast to the interior. Using oxcarts, they virtually monopolized this particular freight route by moving goods quickly and cheaply. Anglo competitors appeared by the 1850s but were unable to match the rates charged by the Tejanos. Carting appears to have been the most lucrative business open to poorer Tejanos during these years.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''In parts of south Texas and southern Arizona, Hispanic Americans were able to obtain positions within local government while in New Mexico Hispanic Americans remained an absolute majority of the population until the end of the 19th century. The federal government delayed granting statehood to New Mexico because of its Hispanic American political leadership.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/mexican_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=74 Digital History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630202455/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/mexican_voices/voices_display.cfm?id=74 |date=June 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite integration, Hispanic Americans managed to retain their [[Spanish language]] and culture. They were most successful in those areas where they had retained some measure of political or economic power, where Jim Crow laws imposed a forced isolation or where immigrants from Mexico made up a significant percentage of the community.

==Anti-Mexican American violence (1840s to 1900s)==
The lynching of Mexicans and Mexican Americans in the Southwest has long been overlooked in American history. This may be due to the fact that most historical records categorized Mexicans, Italians, Native Americans, and sometimes Chinese lynching victims as white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_2 | work=Journal of Social History | title=The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 | first=William D. | last=Carrigan | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that at least 597 Mexican Americans were lynched between 1848 and 1928. Mexicans were [[lynched]] at a rate of 27.4 per 100,000 of population between 1880 and 1930. This statistic is second only to that of the African American community during that period, which suffered an average of 37.1 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia.com"/&gt; Between 1848 and 1879, Mexicans were lynched at an unprecedented rate of 473 per 100,000 of population. Most of these lynchings were not instances of "frontier justice"—of the 597 total victims, only 64 were lynched in areas which lacked a formal judicial system.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2005/is_2_37/ai_111897839/pg_9 | work=Journal of Social History | title=The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in the United States, 1848 to 1928 | first=William D. | last=Carrigan | year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of lynching victims were denied access to a trial while others were convicted in unfair trials.

During the [[California Gold Rush]], as many as 25,000 Mexicans arrived in California. Many of these Mexicans were experienced miners and had some success mining gold in California. Some Anglos reacted with violence. Between 1848 and 1860, at least 163 Mexicans were lynched in California alone.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"/&gt;

==Immigration and diffusion==
Hispanic Americans made up a significant number of workers in a number of industries, particularly the railroad and mining industries in the southwestern U.S., that led to the growth of communities throughout the region. The employment needs of the railroad industry in the late 19th century brought Mexican immigrants from more remote regions of Mexico, while the new systems integrated the border regions of the United States and Mexico. The railroad also led to the economic development of those parts of the US, drawing Mexican immigrants in large numbers into agriculture in the early 20th century, establishing a pattern that continued thereafter.

These largely male Mexican immigrants also established ''colonias'' in the early 20th century in places such as [[Chicago]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] and [[Salt Lake City, Utah]] as railroad employment took them further within the United States. Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants also moved in large numbers to [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]], the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] Bay area, and to a lesser extent to [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] and the [[Monongahela Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]], during [[World War I]] to work in the steel and automobile manufacturing industry. Others began migrating from South Texas to work in cotton fields elsewhere in Texas and [[Oklahoma]], and from Southern California went to work in summer harvests of groves and orchards in [[Oregon]] and the [[Yakima Valley AVA|Yakima Valley]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]].

More recently, beginning in significant numbers in the 1970s, Mexican immigrants have moved in large numbers to the Midwest U.S., attracted by jobs in the packinghouse industry, and to the southeastern U.S., where they have displaced many African-Americans and contract workers from the Caribbean in agriculture and related industries. This large wave of Mexican immigration are attracted to low-paid labor jobs and an equally high number moved to low-income communities, such as industrial suburbs of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] in ethnic neighborhoods known as ''barrios'' and the agricultural sector of [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]], [[California]].

==Early 20th-century Texas==
In Texas, people of Hispanic ethnicity, most of whom were Mexican nationals, began arriving in greater numbers between 1900 and 1930. Adding to the number of older Hispanic residents already in Texas, some of whom had been here since the Spanish Colonial Era, many of these new immigrants engaged in cotton production by performing the back-breaking work of hoeing cotton fields clean of weeds and harvesting the mature crop during the summer and fall. These resilient people established themselves in communities where earlier Hispanics already existed. From settlements in The Rio Grande Valley, in South Texas, communities in the Nueces Strip-between Three Rivers and Corpus Cristi, Texas-and the interior city of San Antonio, Hispanics ventured outward following the maturing cotton crop north and west. They traveled by extended family groups on an odyssey known as "The Big Swing". Along the route some younger family members might land a permanent job and stay behind. From Lubbock to San Angelo, Hispanics now form an integral part of their local communities.

==="Nuevomexicanos" in New Mexico, 1900–1930 ===
Hispanics living in New Mexico were relegated to second-class social status by the socio economically dominant non Hispanic population. Some of these "Anglos" deprecated Hispanic/Mexican culture. and questioned the native populations fitness for democracy. Some claim, in response, they constructed a "Spanish American" identity in an early instance of cultural citizenship (expressing Americanism through ethnic identity) but this is strongly disputed by Richard Nostrand.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Nostrand, ''The Hispano Homeland'' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States home front during World War I|World War I]] gave the Hispanics the opportunity to prove their full American citizenship. Like the "new immigrants" in eastern cities who also constructed dual identities, members of the Nuevomexicano middle class exuberantly participated in the war effort. They melded images of their heritage with patriotic symbols of America, especially in the Spanish-language press. Nuevomexicano politicians and community leaders recruited the rural masses into the war cause overseas and on the home front, including the struggle for woman suffrage. Support from New Mexico's Anglo establishment aided their efforts. Their wartime contributions improved the conditions of minority citizenship for Nuevomexicanos but did not entirely eliminate social inequality. For example, no Hispanics—not even the son of a regent—was allowed in a fraternity at the state university.&lt;ref&gt; 
*Phillip Gonzales and Ann Massmann, "Loyalty Questioned: Nuevomexicanos in the Great War." ''Pacific Historical Review'', Nov 2006, Vol. 75 Issue 4, pp 629–666
*Phillip B. Gonzales, "Spanish Heritage and Ethnic Protest in New Mexico: The Anti-Fraternity Bill of 1933," ''New Mexico Historical Review'', Fall 1986, Vol. 61 Issue 4, pp 281–299&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anglos and Hispanics cooperated because both prosperous and poor Hispanics could vote and they outnumbered the Anglos. Around 1920, the term "Spanish-American" replaced "Mexican" in polite society and in political debate. The new term served both the interests of both groups. For Spanish speakers, it evoked Spain, Not Mexico, recalling images of a romantic colonial past and suggesting a future of equality in Anglo-dominated America. For Anglos, on the other hand, it was a useful term that upgraded the state's image, for the old image as a "Mexican" land suggested violence and disorder, and had discouraged capital investment and set back the statehood campaign. The new term gave the impression that "Spanish Americans" belonged to a true American political culture, making the established order appear all the more democratic.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Montgomery, "Becoming 'Spanish-American': Race and Rhetoric in New Mexico Politics, 1880–1928," ''Journal of American Ethnic History'' (2001) 20#4 pp 59–84&lt;/ref&gt;

==1910–1930s==
After 1911 the ferocious civil wars in Mexico led 600,000 to 1 million refugees to flee north across the border, which was generally open. Well educated middle-class families emigrated, as well as poor citizens.

In Texas a band of radicals issued the manifesto "[[Plan de San Diego]]" in 1915 in South Texas calling on Hispanics to reconquer the Southwest and kill all the Anglo men. Rebels assassinated opponents and killed several dozen people in attacks on railroads and ranches before the Texas Rangers smashed the insurrection. Tejanos strongly repudiated the Plan and affirmed their American loyalty by founding the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC). LULAC, headed by professionals, businessmen and modernizers, became the central Tejano organization promoting civic pride and civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin H. Johnson, ''Revolution in Texas: How a Forgotten Rebellion and Its Bloody Suppression Turned Mexicans into Americans''. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 500,000 returned after 1930, but many stayed. The consulates of the Mexican government in major cities in the Southwest organized a network of "juntas patrioticas" (patriotic councils) and "comisiónes honoríficos" (honorary committees) to celebrate Mexican national holidays such as the [[Cinco de Mayo]]; the target audience was the Latino middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

In borderlands towns such as Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Laredo, San Antonio, El Paso, Tucson, Yuma, San Diego, and Los Angeles, local Latino leaders wanted to restrict the influx of immigrants, because the newcomers directly competed with resident Latinos for jobs and housing and because they reinforced negative stereotypes regarding a lazy and violent lifestyle. In 1929 the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] (LULAC) was formed on the premise that full acceptance of American social, educational and political values was the only way Latinos could reasonably expect to improve their political, economic, and social position in American society. Some upwardly mobile families joined Protestant churches, but most remained devout, conservative Roman Catholics. From the early 1930s through the 1960s, LULAC's political agenda focused on citizenship training and naturalization of "foreign-born Mexicans," English-language training, active support of antidiscriminatory litigation and legislation (particularly regarding public schools), and strict control of further immigration from Mexico. LULAC promoted the liberal rhetoric of "equality" and "rights" and the mutual obligations of [[Republicanism, U.S.|republican civic duty]]. However, voting levels were quite low, and especially in South Texas the Latino vote was controlled by local "bosses." There was little in the way of radical movements.

===Mexican immigration===
Most Mexican-Americans are descendants of immigrants who moved into the U.S. in high numbers after 1910.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  Many first arrived as agricultural laborers in farming valleys of the southern ends of the border states of California, especially the [[Imperial Valley]]; Arizona, especially [[Tucson]]; New Mexico; and Texas, especially the [[Rio Grande Valley]]. Anglo-Americans hired Mexicans and U.S. born Mexicans to work in the region's year-round agricultural economy, most notably in tomatoes, carrots, lettuce, grapes, strawberries and citrus fruit. Mexican farm laborers along with [[African Americans]], [[Filipino Americans]], [[Japanese-Americans]], and even [[Armenian Americans]], [[Native Hawaiians]] and [[Native Americans of the United States|American Indians]] were highly instrumental and contributed to California becoming the nation's leading agricultural state in the 20th century.

Large-scale emigration from central Mexico to the United States began in the 1920s. Mexico was exempted from the system of quotas created by the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], with U.S. politicians hoping to dissuade the revolutionary government from carrying out the nationalization the nation's oil reserves decreed in the [[1917 Constitution of Mexico]]. In 1926, the anti-clerical policies of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] led to a rebellion by Catholic ranchers and peasants in [[Jalisco]] and [[Michoacán]], known as the [[Cristero War]]. The rebellion spread to thirteen states across the center of Mexico, with upwards of 50,000 people taking up arms to defend the [[Catholic Church]]. Although they failed to capture any major cities, the [[Mexican Army|federal army]] was unable to defeat these mounted guerillas. Between 1926 and 1930, the Cristiada War claimed 70,000 lives, led to the internal migration of 200,000 people, as well as the external emigration (mostly to the U.S.) of over 450,000 people. 'The establishment of a major Mexican presence in California dates back to these years.' &lt;ref&gt;Enrique Krauze, ''Mexico: A Biography of Power'', Pg. 423&lt;/ref&gt; Mexicans met the increasing demand for cheap labor on the West Coast after draconian restrictions were imposed on Asian immigration. During this period, Mexicans began to migrate to areas outside the Southwest; they were imported to work in the steel mills of [[Chicago]] during a strike in 1919, and again in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Aristide Zoldberg, ''A Nation by Design'', Pg. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Many would find work on the assembly lines of automobile factories in [[Detroit]], and in the meat-packing plants of Chicago and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]].

====1930s====
During the [[Great Depression in the United States]], the federal [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] adopted a policy of [[Mexican Repatriation|repatriation]]; some 400,000 Mexican immigrants and their children were given one-way tickets home. Texas used [[Texas Ranger Division|Rangers]] to forcibly evict Mexicans who refused to accept voluntary repatriation, while Illinois, Indiana and Michigan paid for special trains to take Mexicans home.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Tischauser, ''The Changing Nature of Racial and Ethnic Conflict in U.S. History'' Pg. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] promoted a "good neighbor" policy that sought better relations with Mexico. In 1935 a federal judge ruled that three Mexican immigrants were ineligible for citizenship because they were not white, as required by federal law. Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white. This policy encouraged the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] in its quest to minimize discrimination by asserting whiteness. LULAC, with its middle class base aspiring to the [[American Dream]], emphasized its loyalty to the United States, its commitment to individual achievement, and free-market capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;

==1940s==

===World War II===
World War II was a watershed for all the Latino groups. Enthusiasm for the war was high.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Mendoza, "'I Know No Other Country': Tejanos and the American Wars of the Twentieth Century, 1917-1972", ''Military History of the West'' (2011) 41#1 pp 31-59.&lt;/ref&gt; Some 500,000 men were drafted or volunteered; even larger numbers of women and older men worked in high paying munitions plants, ending the hardship years of the depression and inspiring demands for upward mobility and political rights. The LULAC and [[El Congreso de Pueblos de Habla Española]] (the Spanish-Speaking Peoples' Congress), founded before the war, expanded their membership and more successfully demanded full integration for their middle class constituents. LULAC expanded from its Texas base into New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia E. Orozco, "Regionalism, Politics, and Gender in Southwest History: The League of United Latin American Citizens' Expansion into New Mexico from Texas, 1929-1945,"''Western Historical Quarterly'' (1998) 29#4 pp. 459-483&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arizona community organizations were very active in patriotic efforts to support American troops abroad, and made efforts to support the war effort materially and to provide moral support for the young American men fighting the war, especially the young Mexican-American men from local communities. Some of the community projects were cooperative ventures in which members of both the Mexican-American and Anglo communities participated. Most efforts made in the Mexican-American community, however, represented localized American home front activities that were separate from the activities of the Anglo community.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Marín, "Mexican Americans on the Home Front: Community Organizations in Arizona During World War II," ''Perspectives in Mexican American Studies'' 1993 4: 75-92&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican-American women organized to assist their servicemen and the war effort. An underlying goal of the Spanish-American Mothers and Wives Association was the reinforcement of the woman's role in Spanish-Mexican culture. The organization raised thousands of dollars, wrote letters, and joined in numerous celebrations of their culture and their support for Mexican-American servicemen. Membership reached over 300 during the war and eventually ended its existence in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;

Labor unions opened their membership rolls and Luisa Moreno became the first Latina to hold a national union office, as vice-president of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA), and affiliate of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

Teenagers developed their own music, language and dress. For the men, the style was to wear a [[zoot suit]] — a flamboyant long coat with baggy pegged pants, a pork pie hat, a long key chain and shoes with thick soles. They called themselves "Pachucos." Trouble broke out in Los Angeles and several smaller cities, where servicemen in uniform who had never seen a Mexican American took umbrage at well-paid teenagers taking their leisure. [[Zoot Suit Riots|Skirmishes and mini riots]] erupted in 1943, but the servicemen moved out, no one was killed, and there were few long-term reverberations.&lt;ref&gt;Luis Alvarez, ''The Power of the Zoot: Youth Culture and Resistance During World War II'' (University of California Press, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexican Americans had learned new trades and organizational skills in service, and many civilian men and women had taken well-paid jobs in war industries. The veterans were fully eligible for the GI Bill, which financed 52 weeks of unemployment insurance as well as very low cost home mortgages and free high school and college educations, and free medical care at VA hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Rosales, "Fighting the Peace at Home: Mexican American Veterans and the 1944 GI Bill of Rights," ''Pacific Historical Review'' (2011) 80#4 pp. 597-627 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/phr.2011.80.4.597 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; However the community felt it did not gain the full measure of economic and political equality it had earned on the battlefield; that disappointment led to a new level of activism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Griswold del Castillo, ed., ''World War II and Mexican American Civil Rights'' (2008) [https://www.amazon.com/World-Mexican-American-Civil-Rights/dp/0292717393/ excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bracero Program===
When the U.S. entered the war it turned to Mexico to address wartime labor shortages. In August 1942 the [[Bracero Program]] was launched for the importation of temporary contract laborers from Mexico. By the time it ended in 1964 more than 4 million Mexican farm-workers arrived in the U.S. under this [[guest worker program]], most of them destined for the cotton-fields and orchards of California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] and the [[Pacific Northwest]], and the ranches and sugar beet farms of the Midwest. Texas chose to opt out of the Bracero program and hire farm-workers directly from Mexico. At its height, over 437,000 guest-workers entered the U.S. annually. The invention of mechanical cotton harvesters reduced labor needs, and scandals over the exploitation of guest workers led the [[U.S. Department of Labor|Department of Labor]] official overseeing the program to denounce it as 'legalized slavery'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn Stephen|title=Transborder Lives: Indigenous Oaxacans in Mexico, California, and Oregon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nK8yNEGUuP0C&amp;pg=PA72|year=2007|publisher=Duke U.P.|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Since 1965===
The [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965]] set strict quotas on the number of persons who could legally enter the U.S. from Latin American nations, and most new Mexican migration to the U.S. in the 1960s and 1970s was temporary and short-term. Since the 1980s, Mexican migration has increased dramatically. The [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]] granted amnesty to illegal immigrants who had resided in the U.S. before 1982, while imposing penalties on employers who hired illegal immigrants. Several factors led to an increase in Mexican immigration to the U.S. The [[Latin American debt crisis]] of the 1980s led to high rates of unemployment in Mexico and destroyed the savings of a large portion of the middle-class, as did the [[1994 economic crisis in Mexico|1994 Mexican Peso Crisis]]. In 1991, Mexican president [[Carlos Salinas]] dismantled the communally-owned [[ejido]]s, one of the most important legacies of the [[Mexican Revolution]], and the enactment of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] brought a flood of subsidized U.S. corn into the Mexican market, driving down grain prices and forcing hundreds of thousands of people from rural areas to migrate in search of better economic opportunities. The 2000 Census showed that the foreign-born population of the U.S. increased by 11.3 million people in the 1990s, and Mexican immigrants accounted for 43% of that growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sph.sc.edu/cli/pdfs/final_final%5B1%5D.pdf|format=PDF|title=MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS IN SOUTH CAROLINA: A PROFILE|website=Sph.sc.edu|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region which had the fastest-growing immigrant population was the [[Southern United States|Southeast]], where many Mexicans who found work in construction, as migrant agricultural laborers, and in textile mills and chicken processing plants. The Latino populations of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[North Carolina|North]] and [[South Carolina]], and [[Arkansas]] increased between 300 and 400 per cent from 1990 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/hispanic/hispanic.html|title=US Census Bureau: Page has moved|website=Census.gov|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labor struggles==
[[File:Dolores Huerta in Santa Barbara.jpg|left|thumb|Dolores Huerta speaking at a rally in [[Santa Barbara, California]] on September 24, 2006.]]
Mexican-American workers formed unions of their own and joined integrated unions throughout the 20th century. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) was particularly active in organizing Mexican-American farm workers and hard rock miners the first three decades of that century, in Arizona and elsewhere. In 1917, many of them were expelled in the [[Bisbee Deportation]].

The first recorded strike led by Mexican-Americans was in the start of the 20th century in [[Southern California]]. There, a small group of Mexican farm laborers along with Japanese-Americans organized strikes in 1905 near [[Oxnard, California|Oxnard]] in [[Ventura County, California]] but were not successful in meeting demands for better wages and working conditions.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

From about 1902 to 1914, the [[United Mine Workers of America]] (UMWA) attempted to organize coal miners in Colorado. In 1927, Mexican-American coal miners participated in a bloody [[Columbine Mine massacre|coal strike in Colorado]], walking out under the banner of the IWW. Mexican-Americans in the southeastern part of the state, particularly from the [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], and [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]] areas, took leadership roles in the 1927 strike.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Numerous workers from Mexico were in the mines. As many as 60 percent of all these wage earners had come to Colorado after further labor troubles at [[Colorado Fuel and Iron]] (CF&amp;I) properties in 1919 and 1921. As the IWW agitation increased in 1926-27, mine owners refused to hire Mexicans, blaming them for the labor unrest''.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Goodstein, Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, page 110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The UMWA returned to northern Colorado in 1928, just weeks after a machine-gun massacre of strikers, when [[Josephine Roche]], president of the [[Rocky Mountain Fuel Company]], invited the [[American Federation of Labor|AFL-affiliated]] organization to take the place of the more radical IWW.

The movie ''[[Salt of the Earth (1954 film)|Salt of the Earth]]'' depicts another strike, waged by the mostly Mexican-American members of the [[Western Federation of Miners|Mine Mill and Smelter Workers]]; the movie itself became an important document in the later Chicano movement.

[[File:Cesar chavez crop2.jpg|[[César Chávez]] at a [[United Farmworkers]] rally, 1974|thumb|upright]]
The most significant union struggle involving Mexican-Americans was the [[United Farm Workers]]' long strike and boycott aimed at grape growers in the [[San Joaquin Valley|San Joaquin]] and [[Coachella Valley]]s in the late 1960s, followed by campaigns to organize lettuce workers in California and Arizona, farm workers in Texas, and orange grove workers in Florida. While the union suffered severe setbacks in California in 1973 and never established a strong union presence in other states, its struggle propelled [[César Chávez]] and [[Dolores Huerta]] into national prominence, while providing the foot soldiers who helped increase the visibility of Mexican-Americans within the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in California and elect a number of Mexican-American candidates in the 1970s and 1980s.

More recently, the [[Service Employees International Union]] has led a number of successful "[[Justice for Janitors]]" campaigns throughout the United States among predominantly immigrant workers, many of whom have come from Mexico and [[Central America]]. Those campaigns do not stress cultural or ethnic identity in the way that the UFW did, but have linked immigrant workers' struggles with the political interests of Mexican-Americans in many communities, such as Los Angeles.

The [[Industrial Workers of the World|IWW]] is also once again organizing, particularly among Troquero truck drivers and immigrant taxi drivers in the [[Los Angeles, California]] area.

==Civil rights movement==
Tejanos &amp;mdash; Texans of Spanish and/or Mexican descent &amp;mdash; formed several organizations in the early 20th century to protect themselves from official and private discrimination, but made only partial progress in addressing the worst forms of official ethnic discrimination. One of those organizations, the [[League of United Latin American Citizens]] formed in 1929, remains active today.

The movement to overturn the many forms of state-sponsored discrimination directed at Hispanic Americans was strongest in Texas during the first fifty years of the 20th century. The movement picked up steam after [[World War II]], when groups such as the [[American G.I. Forum]], formed by returning veterans, joined in the efforts of organizations such as LULAC to demand an end to segregated schools and denial of the right to vote. Hispanic Americans brought several legal cases against school segregation in [[San Antonio]] and [[Corpus Christi, Texas]], in the 1940s and similar battles in [[San Diego]] and [[Orange County, California]].

During [[The Great Depression]], the United States government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico, but thousands were deported against their will. More than 500,000 individuals repatriated (only a small portion were deported), approximately 60 percent of which were actually United States citizens or residents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campusapps.fullerton.edu/news/2005/valenciana.html 1930s Mexican Deportation: Educator brings attention to historic period and its effect on her family&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005062329/http://campusapps.fullerton.edu/news/2005/valenciana.html |date=2006-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Counseling Kevin: The Economy"&gt;[http://www.counselingkevin.com/the_economy/index.html Counseling Kevin: The Economy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902035337/http://www.counselingkevin.com/the_economy/index.html |date=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war [[McCarthy era]], the Justice Department launched [[Operation Wetback]], which deported over 70,000 illegal immigrants and resulted in over 700,000 leaving voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Counseling Kevin: The Economy"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Zootsuitriot.jpg|right|thumb|250px|'''[[Zoot Suit riots]]''', June 1943]] --&gt; 
Mexican-Americans, mestizos especially, also faced heightened [[racism]] during World War II, most famously during the [[Zoot Suit Riots]], when sailors in Los Angeles attacked Mexican-American youths in 1943, and in the Sleepy Lagoon Case, in which a number of young men were wrongly convicted in a case marked by sensationalized press coverage and overt racism from the prosecution and judge. That trial and verdict, overturned on appeal after a broad-based committee was created to support the defendants, is depicted in [[Luis Valdez]]' play and film ''Zoot Suit''. At the same time, the United States was importing thousands of Mexican farm workers under the [[Bracero]] program that used them as temporary labor, without employment rights.

According to the [[National World War II Museum]], between 250,000 and 500,000 Hispanic Americans served in the Armed Forces during WWII. Thus, Hispanic Americans comprised 2.3% to 4.7% of the Army. The exact number, however is unknown as at the time Hispanics were classified as whites. Generally Mexican American World War II servicemen were integrated into regular military units. However, many Mexican–American War veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] when they arrived home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208043359/http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/press3b.htm|title=press3b|date=8 December 2006|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, war veteran Dr [[Hector P. Garcia]] founded the [[American GI Forum]] to address the concerns of Mexican American veterans who were being discriminated against. The AGIF's first campaign was on the behalf of [[Felix Longoria]], a Mexican American private who was killed in the [[Philippines]] in the line of duty. Upon the return of his body to his hometown of [[Three Rivers, Texas]], he was denied funeral services because he was Mexican American. Under the guidance of [[Hector P. Garcia]] and [[Vicente T. Ximenes]] the AGIF throughout the 1950s expanded its role as an agency for civil rights advocacy beyond that of solely advocating for Hispanic veterans.

Mexican American school children were subject to racial segregation in the public school system. They were forced to attend "Mexican schools" in California. In 1947, the [[Mendez v. Westminster]] ruling declared that segrating children of "Mexican and Latin descent" in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and the state of [[California]] was unconstitutional. This ruling helped lay the foundation for the landmark [[Brown v Board of Education]] case which ended racial segregation in the public school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latinola.com/story.php?story=432|title=LatinoLA - Hollywood :: Mendez v. Westminster|website=LatinoLA|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many counties in the Southwestern United States, Mexican Americans were not selected as jurors in court cases which involved a Mexican American defendant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas |id=jrh01 |name=Hernandez v. State of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Pete Hernandez, an agricultural worker, was indicted of murder by an all-Anglo jury in [[Jackson County, Texas]]. Hernandez believed that the jury could not be impartial unless members of other races were allowed on the jury-selecting committees, seeing that a Mexican American had not been on a jury for more than 25 years in that particular county. Hernandez and his lawyers decided to take the case to the Supreme Court. The [[Hernandez v. Texas]] Supreme Court ruling declared that Mexican Americans and other racial groups in the United States were entitled to equal protection under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1950-1959/1953/1953_406/|title=Body Politic|website=Oyez.org|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most prominent civil rights organization in the Mexican-American community is the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF), founded in 1968. Although modeled after the [[NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund]], MALDEF has also taken on many of the functions of other organizations, including political advocacy and training of local leaders.

==Chicano movement==
{{main|Chicano Movement}}{{see also|Chicano studies}}
The [[Chicano]] movement blossomed in the 1960s. The movement had roots in the civil rights struggles that had preceded it, adding to it the cultural and generational politics of the era.

The early proponents of the movement &amp;mdash; [[Rodolfo Gonzales]] in [[Denver, Colorado]] and [[Reies Tijerina]] in New Mexico &amp;mdash; adopted a historical account of the preceding hundred and twenty-five years that obscured much of Mexican-American history. Gonzales and Tijerina embraced a form of nationalism that was based on the failure of the United States government to live up to the promises that it had made in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasculturas.com/lib/sd/blsd092200a.php A History of Mexican Americans in California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927085843/http://www.lasculturas.com/lib/sd/blsd092200a.php |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

That version of the past did not, on the other hand, take into account the history of those Mexicans who had immigrated to the United States. It also gave little attention to the rights of illegal immigrants in the United States in the 1960s &amp;mdash; not surprising, since immigration did not have the political significance it was to acquire in the years to come. It was only a decade later when activists embraced the rights of illegal immigrants and helped broaden the focus to include their rights.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Instead, when the movement dealt with practical problems most activists focused on the most immediate issues confronting Mexican-Americans: unequal educational and employment opportunities, political disenfranchisement, and police brutality. In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement brought about more or less spontaneous actions, such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] in 1968 and the [[Chicano Moratorium]] in Los Angeles in 1970.

The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed [[MEChA]], ''el Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán'', which promoted Chicano Studies programs and a generalized nationalist agenda. The student movement produced a generation of future political leaders, including [[Richard Alatorre]] and [[Cruz Bustamante]] in California.

Some women who worked within the Chicano movement felt that participants were more worried about other issues, such as immigration, than solving problems that affected women. This led Chicanas to form the [[Comisión Femenil Mexicana Nacional]] in 1970.

By the mid 1980s to our present day, a major focus of the Chicano movement has been to advance the representation of Chicanos in all American mainstream media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mexican-american.org/chicano-movement/index.html "The Chicano Movement Today: El Poder de Hoy" &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425075943/http://mexican-american.org/chicano-movement/index.html |date=2012-04-25 }} - Xcano Media, Los Angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the American mainstream news media and U.S. educational institutions by Chicano activists has been particularly harsh in recent years subsequent to the massive displays of support for immigrant rights such as that seen during La Gran Marcha&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granmarcha.org "GranMarcha.org"&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] - Commemorative site for La Gran Marcha, March 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (The Great March) on March 25, 2006 in Los Angeles. As of today, this self-proclaimed "largest march in U.S. history" which was primarily organized by Mexican American organizations, Chicano activists, and fueled through a large network of active Internet users, L.A. Spanish language television, and Spanish language news radio coverage, is still virtually ignored by American mainstream (English language) news media and all textbooks of the American educational system.

==Seasonal migration==
A common pattern emerged after 1940 of men working summers in the U.S. and spending the winter season in the village back in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hannah Gill|title=The Latino Migration Experience in North Carolina: New Roots in the Old North State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLC0R_MwzGMC&amp;pg=PA66|year=2010|publisher=U of North Carolina Press|pages=66–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this became illegal in 1965, the numbers involved kept growing. By 2007 there were 12&amp;nbsp;million or so undocumented workers in the U.S.; they had jobs, often using fake identity cards. They made money in the U.S. but returned to the villages to spend it, tend to family business, and participate in extended kinship rituals such as baptisms, weddings, and funerals. After the increased border security following the 9-11 attacks in 2001, the back-and-forth pattern became dangerous. People kept coming north, but they stayed in the U.S. and sent money home every month. Locked into the American economy year-round, millions of these undocumented workers moved out of season agricultural jobs into year-round jobs in restaurants, hotels, construction, landscaping and semiskilled factory work, such as meat packing. Most paid federal social security taxes into imaginary accounts (and thus were not eligible for benefits.) Few had high enough incomes to pay federal or state income taxes, but all paid local and state sales taxes on their purchases as well as local property taxes (via their rent payments to landlords).

==Electoral politics==
In 1963, in [[Crystal City, Texas]] the mainly Mexican-American [[immigrant|migrant]] community together with the support of the [[Teamsters Union]] and the [[Political Association of Spanish-Speaking Organizations]] (PASSO), an outgrowth of the Viva Kennedy clubs of 1960, encouraged Mexican-American men and women to pay their [[Poll tax (United States)|poll tax]] and choose their own candidates. Led by Teamsters business agent and [[cannery]] employee, Juan Cornejo, five Mexican-Americans, despite intimidation by the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], won the support of their community young and old alike who thanks to the protection provided by the Teamsters and PASSO mobilized for electoral victory. This "revolt" was covered nationwide and reported in the [[New York Times]] and the [[Wall Street Journal]]. This election led Americans outside of the [[Southwest United States|Southwest]] to take note of America's other [[minority group|minority]] community as a political force.

As a result of the [[Voting Rights Act]], followed up by intensive political organizing, Mexican-Americans were able to achieve a new degree of political power and representation in Texas and elsewhere in the Southwest. The [[La Raza Unida Party]], headed by [[José Ángel Gutiérrez]] of Crystal City, Texas made startling progress in the poorest regions in the [[Rio Grande Valley]] with its base of operations at Crystal City, Texas in the early 1970s, spreading for a while to Colorado, Wisconsin, California, Michigan, Oregon, Kansas, Illinois and several other states. The party faded in the mid 1970s and held on only in Crystal City, Texas before collapsing in the early 1980s. Veterans from the party, such as Willie Velasquez, became active in [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] politics and in organizing projects such as the [[Southwest Voter Registration Education Project]], which boosted the electoral fortunes of Mexican-American candidates throughout the Southwest.

Results came more slowly in California, on the other hand: although Los Angeles had a significant Mexican-American population, [[gerrymandering]] eliminated the seat held by [[Edward R. Roybal]], the only Mexican-American member of the Los Angeles City Council, in 1959. La Raza Unida Party campaigns in the early 1970s had the practical effect of defeating Mexican-American Democratic candidates, embittering many activists against the party and the form of nationalism it represented.

It would be more than twenty years before another Mexican-American was elected to the Los Angeles City Council and it would take litigation to permit a Mexican-American to win election to the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] in the 1980s, the first Mexican-American to join that body in more than a century. In the 1990s, Mexican-American politicians held high offices throughout California. In 2005, [[Antonio Villaraigosa]] was elected mayor of [[Los Angeles]], the first Latino in 130 years to hold the seat.

Voters have elected a number of governors of Mexican-American descent in the Southwest, including Jerry Apodaca and [[Bill Richardson]] in New Mexico and [[Raúl Castro]] in Arizona. Colorado voters recently elected [[Ken Salazar]] as the first Mexican-American Senator from that state. [[Cruz Bustamante]] was the first lieutenant governor of California in 130 years from his election in 1999 to 2007, but Bustamante lost the gubernatorial election to Austrian-born actor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], who went on to be state governor.

Mexican-Americans have also achieved some degree of political recognition in Chicago, where they make up roughly 75% of a Hispanic community that also includes significant numbers of [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]] and immigrants from other Spanish-speaking countries. That predominantly Mexican-American community has elected [[Luis Gutierrez]], whose ancestry is Puerto Rican, to represent it in Congress and a number of Mexican-American politicians at the state and local level.

===Voting patterns===
Mexican-Americans tend to vote Democratic (in 1960, the [[John F. Kennedy]] presidential campaign boosted the Mexican American vote to over 80% for Kennedy). However Mexican-Americans in recent decades had a low turnout on election day. George W. Bush targeted Hispanics and won 35% of their votes in 2000, and 40% in 2004. Barack Obama gained 67% of the Hispanic vote in 2008, and, after extensive get-out-the-vote campaigns reached 71% in 2012.  Hispanics—including groups besides the Mexican-Americans—comprised 8% of the electorate in 2004, 9% in 2008 and 10% in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Hugo Lopez and Paul Taylor, " Latino Voters in the 2012 Election" [http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/11/07/latino-voters-in-the-2012-election/ ''Pew Research'' Nov. 7, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Republican strategist blamed their worsening performance among a large, young, and rapidly growing group on the hostility GOP candidates displayed toward illegal immigrants, and argued the party needed to moderate its position.&lt;ref&gt;Pili Tobar, "New Poll: Latino Voters and the 2013 Immigration Debate," [http://americasvoiceonline.org/blog/new-poll-latino-voters-and-the-2013-immigration-debate/ ''America's Voice'' March 5, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7226">'''Imputed income''' is the [[Haig–Simons income|accession to wealth]] that can be attributed, or [[Theory of imputation|imputed]], to a person when they avoid paying for services by providing the services to themselves, or when the person avoids paying rent for durable goods by owning the durable goods, as in the case of [[imputed rent]].

==Taxation of imputed income==

Many countries, such as the United States, tax imputed income only in certain limited situations. Imputed income is sometimes difficult to measure, and tax policies regarding imputed income can have political consequences. For taxpayers, not taxing imputed income creates a tax incentive in favor of owning over renting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nber.org/chapters/c7707.pdf |title=The distribution of gains and losses from changes in the tax treatment of housing |pages=118–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in favor of self-service over hiring.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} For the economy, not taxing imputed income directs economic activity away from activities associated with extreme and severe [[division of labor]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

===Example: Durable property===
Home ownership is an example of an instance involving imputed income from durable property. If someone lives in their own property, they forgo the rental income on this property in exchange for not owing an equivalent amount of rent to someone else. In effect they are paying rent to their mortgage lender. They also avoid paying income taxes on a portion of that rental income. (In the specific example of home ownership in the United States, this effect is emphasized by allowing home owners to deduct a certain level of their interest payments—but not mortgage principal payments—on home mortgage debts when computing taxable income for [[Income tax in the United States|U.S. federal income tax]] purposes.)

===Example: Personal services===
An example of imputed income in connection with personal services is the situation where a stay at home mother or father is not taxed on wages that the family implicitly "pays" her or him for their services. If she or he were working for compensation, the wages she or he might pay a hired employee would be taxed. This is a systemic unneutrality that is inevitable in any income tax; the tax favors "leisure" (including self-rendered benefits such as shaving and mowing one's own lawn) over "work" (services sold on the market for remuneration).&lt;ref name="Chirelstein2005"&gt;{{cite book |title=Federal Income Taxation: A Law Student's Guide to the Leading Cases and Concepts|last=Chirelstein |first=Marvin |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Foundation Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=1-58778-894-2 |edition=Tenth |pages=26–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of imputing income is logically extensible to any service people perform for themselves, such as cooking their own meals, washing their own laundry, or even bathing themselves.

===Legal application in the United States===

In [[dictum|dicta]] in 1934, the [[Supreme court of the united states|Supreme Court]] touched on the issue of the constitutionality of taxing imputed income:&lt;ref name="scholar.google.com"&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4168218225591685135&amp;q=292+u.s.+371&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=80000002 ''Helvering v. Independent Life Ins. Co.'', 292 U.S. 371, 378-79 (1934)](citations omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the statute lays taxes on the part of the building occupied by the owner or upon the rental value of that space, it cannot be sustained, for that would be to lay a direct tax requiring apportionment. The rental value of the building used by the owner does not constitute income within the meaning of the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name="scholar.google.com"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whether the U.S. Supreme Court of the present day would conclude that there is a constitutional prohibition of imputed income is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Burke &amp; Friel, ''Taxation of Individual Income'', p. 33 (8th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[Internal Revenue Code]] has no provision establishing an exclusion, most types of imputed income are not treated as income for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In 1985, in a discussion of "in kind" income, Professor William D. Andrews, a tax law professor at [[Harvard Law School]], wrote:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another form of income in kind does not even involve a receipt: it is the imputed income that results from the investment of capital or performance of services for one's own personal or family use. No effort has ever been made to tax imputed income generally, and its omission represents such a settled interpretation that any substantial inclusion of such income now would require legislation.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Andrews, ''Basic Federal Income Taxation'', p. 80, Little, Brown &amp; Company (3d ed. 1985). See also Burke &amp; Friel, ''Taxation of Individual Income'', p. 30 (8th ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Regarding the non-taxability of imputed income from the performance of household services under U.S. federal income tax law, Professor Andrews wrote: ". ... it is commonly considered that difficulties of valuation would interpose an insuperable obstacle to any direct inclusion of such items in taxable income."&lt;ref&gt;William D. Andrews, ''Basic Federal Income Taxation'', p. 81, Little, Brown &amp; Company (3d ed. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators Burke and Friel have written: "The exclusion is rather a matter of administrative practice, but no less firmly established for that reason."&lt;ref&gt;Burke &amp; Friel, ''Taxation of Individual Income'', p. 30 (8th ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the imputed income from the rental value in connection with living in one's own home, Professor Andrews wrote that such income "has never been included in taxable income in the United States."&lt;ref&gt;William D. Andrews, ''Basic Federal Income Taxation'', p. 80, Little, Brown &amp; Company (3d ed. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

On rare occasions, issues concerning imputed income have arisen with regard to working to provide for oneself. At least one court has ruled that the imputed income in connection with produce grown and eaten by a farm owner is not taxable as income to the farmer.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Morris v. Commissioner'', 9 B.T.A. 1273, 1278 (1928) ("It is obvious that [the farmer's produce is] comparable to the rental value of a private residence, which has never been regarded as income or as a factor in the determination of tax liability.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the U.S. federal income tax law does not tax the imputed income consisting of the benefit one obtains from leisure. Professor Andrews wrote: "It would undoubtedly be impractical to try to reflect either the value of leisure or the cost of its sacrifice directly in taxable income."&lt;ref&gt;William D. Andrews, ''Basic Federal Income Taxation'', p. 82, Little, Brown &amp; Company (3d ed. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4100">'''''Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy''''' is a 1985 Czech text adventure for Sinclair ZX Spectrum computers and compatible hardware. It was authored by František Fuka. Two sequels were later produced entitled '''''Indiana Jones II''''' (1987) and '''''Indiana Jones III''''' (1990). The trilogy was later released in 1992 by Proxima Software as part of the Fuxoft brand "Fuxoft uvádí".

A continuation of the series was seen with the 1990 release of ''Indiana Jones a zlatá soška Keltů'', programmed by Jiří Fencl. Fencl also wrote a text adventure named ''Tom Jones''. Due to the series' success, the games were ported to other eight-bit home microcomputers by various authors, sometimes containing only text and sometimes with graphics.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.root.cz/clanky/historie-vyvoje-pocitacovych-her-136-cast-ceske-textovky-iii/|title=Historie vývoje počítačových her (136. část – české textovky III) - Root.cz|first=Pavel|last=Tišnovský|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
František Fuka created Poklad and Poklad 2 in the early 1980s, and these served as a warmup before the designer began making more sophisticated games;
his first major project was ''Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.root.cz/clanky/historie-vyvoje-pocitacovych-her-134-cast-ceske-textovky-ii/?ic=serial-box&amp;icc=text-title#k02|title=Historie vývoje počítačových her (134. část – české textovky II) - Root.cz|first=Pavel|last=Tišnovský|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invented the game during a holiday in Romania, despite him not having seen the movie it was based on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zx-spectrum.cz/index.php?cat1=4&amp;cat2=2&amp;article_id=interview1.txt|title=ZX-Spectrum Games|first=Pavel|last=Plíva|website=www.zx-spectrum.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indiana Jones II'' was released as a free sequel in 1987. It was notable for allowing the player to control the menu, which despite slow rendering and item selection was exceptional for the industry.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Fuka promoted the title as "the first Czech text game with only three buttons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://herniarcheolog.blogspot.com.au/2017/09/hra-114-indiana-jones-2-1987.html|title=Herní Archeolog: Hra 114: Indiana Jones 2 (1987)|first=|last=Ugraugra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Indiana Jones III'' was notable for using a non-standard font upon its release in 1990, which allowed František Fuk to circumvent the display limitations of thirty-two characters per line.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The title contained eight spaces for game saves, which was above that of foreign commercial products.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Plot and gameplay==
The three games are video game adaptions of the first three [[Indiana Jones]] films. They play as text adventure games controlled by keyboard commands. There are over 30 locations in ''Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy'', and the player can die in ten of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://herniarcheolog.blogspot.com.au/2017/03/hra-7-indiana-jones-chram-zkazy-1985.html|title=Herní Archeolog: Hra 7: Indiana Jones a Chrám zkázy (1985)|first=|last=Ugraugra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Root.cz deemed ''Indiana Jones II'' easier than the first title,&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; and deemed ''Indiana Jones III'' the best of the trilogy.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Textovky.cz deemed František Fuk a legend within the Czech video gaming industry, and noted that the Indiana Jones trilogy includes three of the five games that gave him this status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.textovky.cz/clanky/nekolik-zastaveni-ve-zlatych-casech-aneb-ceske-textovky-pro-zx-spectrum-1-dil/|title=Několik zastavení ve Zlatých časech aneb České textovky pro ZX Spectrum (1. díl) - Články - TEXTOVKY.CZ - archiv textových her|website=www.textovky.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jebel Buhais''' (also called Jebel Al-Buhais) is a geological feature, an extensive rocky outcrop, as well as an archaeological site located near [[Al Madam|Madam]], in [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]], [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]]. The area contains an extensive necropolis, consisting of burial sites spanning the [[Stone Age|Stone]], [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] and [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] ages of human settlement in the UAE. Burials at Jebel Buhais (''Jebel'' is Arabic for mountain) date back to the 5th Millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://universes.art/art-destinations/sharjah/archaeological-sites/jebel-al-buhais/|title=Jebel al-Buhais.

The site was first appreciated as being of potential significance by archaeologists from Iraq in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Near Eastern Archaeology in the Past, Present and Future|last=|first=|publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag|year=2010|isbn=978-3447061759|location=Germany|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; but extensive excavations did not take place until the late 1980s, with digs undertaken by the French mission to the Emirate of Sharjah and from the [[Autonomous University of Madrid]] through to the early 1990s. Following this early work, researchers from the Sharjah government's Directorate of Antiquities discovered a camel entombed in a grave site, BHS 12, which led to a team from the [[University of Tübingen]] carrying out digs from 1995 onwards. The discovery and excavation of BHS 12 led to the discovery of the important BHS 18 site, which saw 10 digs from 1996-2005 uncovering a burial site which was to become 'one of the key neolithic sites in Southern Arabia'.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Funeral Monuments and Human Remains from Jebel al-Buhais|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans Peter|publisher=UAE Ministry of Culture and Information|year=2006|isbn=3-935751-06-0|location=UAE|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complete remains of some 600 individuals have been found at the site, with many thought yet to be found.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/culture/7-000-year-old-skeletal-remains-give-glimpse-of-the-past-1.91752|title=7,000-year-old skeletal remains give glimpse of the past|last=Reporter|first=Mariam M.

== Stone Age ==
Dated to the late Stone Age, Neolithic finds at BHS 18 have been carbon-dated spanning some 1,000 years from 5,000 to 4,000 BCE, with burials at the site thought to be those of nomadic herders who travelled inland for the winter season.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jebel Buhais is unique as an inland neolithic site in the UAE, all other sites discovered to date have been coastal, and the site has yielded no evidence of burials in the following millennium. This is thought to be consistent with changing patterns of human life as a result of climate change: a spring discovered at Jebel Buhais dried up at this stage, an event contemporaneous with similar discoveries pointing to increased aridity in the interior of Oman. Throughout Southern Arabia, evidence of human inland settlement in the 3rd millennium BCE is scant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates|last=Potts|first=Daniel|publisher=Trident Press|year=2003|isbn=978-1900724883|location=UK|pages=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post Neolithic era ==
Subsequent burials at Jebel Buhais represent the early Bronze Age [[Hafit period]] (3200 - 2600 BCE), with many distinctive 'beehive' Hafit graves discovered. None, however, were found with human remains of that era. The subsequent era of human occupation, [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar]] (2600-2000 BCE) is not represented at Jebel Buhais although there were Umm Al Nar period burials in nearby Mleiha. Iron Age burials, particularly the group of graves defined as BHS 85, are thought to be linked to the nearby Iron Age settlement site of [[Al Thuqeibah]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq]] graves at Jebel Buhais include those found at BHS 8. A number of later burials, including some invasive later burials in older grave sites, are also evident at the site.

The '''Kasubi Tombs''' in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]], is the site of the burial grounds for four [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabakas]] (kings of [[Buganda]]) and other members of the Baganda royal family.  As a result, the site remains an important spiritual and political site for the [[Baganda|Ganda people]], as well as an important example of traditional architecture.  It became a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in December 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/143/|title=World Heritage Committee Inscribes 31 New Sites on the World Heritage List|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was described as "one of the most remarkable buildings using purely vegetal materials in the entire region of sub-Saharan Africa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/1022.pdf |title=Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major buildings there were almost completely destroyed by a fire in March 2010, the cause of which is under investigation. As a result, in July 2010 it was included in the list of [[World Heritage Sites in Danger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/636/|title=List of World Heritage in Danger:  World Heritage Committee inscribes the Tombs of  Buganda Kings (Uganda) and removes Galapagos Islands (Ecuador)|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Buganda Kingdom has vowed to rebuild the tombs of their kings and [[Yoweri Museveni|President Museveni]] said the national government of Uganda would assist in the restoration of the site. Reconstruction started in 2014, funded by the government of Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/news/1124/|title=Reconstruction of the Tombs of the Buganda Kings begins|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre|publisher=|accessdate=14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tombs==
The World Heritage Site comprises around {{convert|26|ha}} on the [[Kasubi hill]] in the city of [[Kampala]], about {{convert|5|km}} northwest of the city centre.  Most of the site is open agricultural land that is farmed using traditional techniques.  One corner contains a royal palace built in 1882 by [[Muteesa I of Buganda|Muteesa I]], the 35th Kabaka of Buganda, to replace a palace built by his built by his father, [[Ssuuna II of Buganda|Ssuuna II]] in 1820.  The new palace became a royal burial ground on his death in 1884.  The site is one of 31 royal tombs across the Buganda kingdom since the kingdom was founded in the 13th century.  Traditionally, the body of the deceased king was buried in one place, with a separate shrine for the deceased king's jawbone, believed to contain his soul.  Unusually, in a break from tradition, the site in Kampala contains the royal tombs of four Kabakas of Buganda:
* [[Muteesa I of Buganda|Muteesa I]] (1835–1884)
* [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] (1867–1903) (died in exile on the Seychelles Islands, and remains returned in 1910)
* [[Daudi Cwa II of Buganda|Daudi Chwa II]] (1896–1939)
* [[Mutesa II of Buganda|Sir Edward Muteesa II]] (1924–1969) (died in exile in London, and remains returned in 1971).
Descendants of these four Kabakas are buried elsewhere on the site.

The border of the ceremonial site were established in 1882 on Kasubi Hill, also known as the Ssekabaka's Tombs.  The borders are still marked with [[barkcloth|bark cloth]] trees (''[[Ficus natalensis]]''), which have protected it from the low-rise residential development that now surround the site on all sides.  The main ceremonial area is located to the northwest of the wider site.  A gatehouse (''Bujjabukula'') leads to a small courtyard and the drum house (''Ndoga-Obukaba'') which houses the royal drums, and then to a second main circular courtyard (''Olugya'') located on the hilltop, surrounded by a reed fence.

[[File:Tombs of Buganda Kings at Kasubi-114327.jpg|thumb|interior of Tombs of  Kasubi Tombs]]
The main central building (''Muzibu Azaala Mpanga''), some {{convert|31|m}} in circumference and {{convert|7.5|m}} high, is located astride the border of the courtyard, on the edge opposite the entrance.  It was originally constructed from wooden poles, reed [[wattle and daub]], topped by a thick thatched dome, with straw resting on 52 rings of palm fronds (representing the 52 traditional clans of the Baganda people).  Modern building materials were introduced in the last major renovation in 1938 by Kabaka [[Mutesa II of Buganda]], including a steel structure, concrete columns, and bricks, largely concealed behind traditional materials. A low wide arch leads to the sacred spaces within, separated by reed partitions, with bark cloth decorations, and momentos of the kabakas.  The tombs are housed in a sacred forest (''Kibira'') within, concealed from public view by a [[barkcloth]] curtain.  The floor is covered by lemon grass and palm leaf mats.

The courtyard is also bordered by several buildings of traditional construction, including several "wives houses" for the deceased kabaka's widows, who tend the family graves.  Their houses are traditionally constructed of wattle and daub with straw thatched roofs, although over time some were rebuilt with bricks and metal roofs added, and tombs for royal relations. It is also the home of members of the royal family, and royal officials including the ''Nalinya'' (spiritual guardian), her deputy the ''Lubuga'' (responsible for coordinating the farming on the site) and her administrative assistant the ''Katikkiro''.  It is also a centre for the traditional manufacture and decoration of bark cloth by the Ngo clan and for traditional thatching techniques of the Ngeye clan.  

The building was maintained and managed by the Buganda Kingdom, the largest of the four ancient kingdoms of Uganda, until it was abolished by Prime Minister (then President) [[Milton Obote]] in 1966, and again after it was reinstated by [[President Museveni]] in 1993.  It became a protected site under Uganda law in 1972, and the land is registered in the name of the Kabaka behalf of the Kingdom.

The site remains an important spiritual and political site for the [[Baganda]] people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kasubitombs.org|title=Kasubi Tombs website|publisher=Kasubitombs.org|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jfCx6jkxjGTU6XiATVu8qXKUwKLg|title=Uganda army deploys after fire destroys historic tombs|publisher=AFP|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Kasubi Tombs were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site .&lt;ref name="AFP"/&gt;

==Destruction==

On 16 March 2010, at about 8.30&amp;nbsp;pm local time, the Kasubi tombs were destroyed by fire.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8571719.stm|title=Uganda's Kasubi royal tombs gutted by fire|date=17 March 2010|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the fire is as yet unknown. The Buganda kingdom has promised to conduct independent investigations into the fire, alongside the national police force.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

John Bosco Walusimbi, Prime Minister of the [[Buganda|Buganda kingdom]], stated on 17 March:

{{quote|The kingdom is in mourning. There are no words to describe the loss occasioned by this most callous act.|''The Guardian''&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/17/kampala-protests-kasubi-tombs|title=Three killed in Kampala clashes after royal mausoleum destroyed by fire|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2010 | location=London | first=Xan | last=Rice | date=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The remains of the kabakas are intact, according to Walusimbi, as the inner sanctum of the tombs was protected from total destruction.

On 17 March 2010, His Majesty the [[Kabaka of Buganda]], [[Muwenda Mutebi II of Buganda|Ronald Muwenda Mutebi II]], and the [[President of Uganda]], [[Yoweri Museveni]], visited the site of the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/10/10/713236|title=Kabaka Mutebi II visits Kasubi tombs|publisher=The New Vision|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=17 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66JPlIDXc?url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/notfound.html|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Monitor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/-/688334/880872/-/wjplgm/-/|title=Kabaka, Museveni, Besigye visit burnt Kasubi tombs|work=Daily Monitor|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of people have also travelled to the site to help salvage any remains.&lt;ref name="Monitor"/&gt;

Riots broke out during the President's visit. Security forces shot dead two (some reports say three) rioters and five were reportedly injured.&lt;ref name="'Two dead' in protests after Uganda tomb fire"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jfCx6jkxjGTU6XiATVu8qXKUwKLg|title='Two dead' in protests after Uganda tomb fire|publisher=AFP|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ugandan soldiers and police also clashed with rioters in the capital city of [[Kampala]]. Forces used tear gas to disperse rioters of the Baganda ethnic group.&lt;ref name="Riots after fire guts Uganda tombs "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/03/20103179133998288.html|title=Riots after fire guts Uganda tombs |publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=17 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The destruction occurred in the midst of an awkward relationship between the government of Uganda and the Buganda kingdom, particularly in light of the September 2009 riots.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Ahead of these riots, the king of Buganda Ronald Mutebi Mwenda was stopped from touring parts of his kingdom, and several journalists who were allegedly sympathetic to the kingdom and the rioters were arrested and are awaiting trial.

==Aftermath of the fire==
The administration of the Buganda Kingdom has vowed to rebuild the tombs and President Museveni said the national government would assist in the restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kabakas still intact, says Katikkiro |first=Joseph |last=Maseruka |newspaper=New Vision |date=17 March 2010 |url=http://newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/713292 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322194125/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/8/12/713292 |archivedate=22 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=17 March 2010|url=http://www.mediacentre.go.ug/details.php?catId=4&amp;item=798|title=Government to help restore Kasubi tombs|publisher=Uganda Media Centre|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726120007/http://www.mediacentre.go.ug/details.php?catId=4&amp;item=798|archivedate=26 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commission was set up to determine the cause of the fire and the civilian deaths in the following days. This commission handed over a report to the Ugandan government in March 2011, but as of April 2012 it had not been released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|

In response to the incident, a mission was dispatched through the UNESCO Japanese Funds-in-Trust for the Preservation of the World Cultural Heritage to create a prevention scheme for reconstruction of the tombs. Based on the results of the mission, the Japanese government decided to provide project fund cooperation for reconstruction of the tombs, removal from the List of World Heritage in Danger, the setup of an efficient risk prevention scheme and the dispatch of experts in cultural property restoration.

The meanings of these words do not always correspond to Germanic cognates, and occasionally the specific meaning in the list is unique to English.

'''Love and hate''' as co-existing forces have been thoroughly explored within the literature of [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; building on awareness of their co-existence in Western culture reaching back to the “odi et amo” of [[Catullus]],&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Fowler, ''A Dictionary of Modern English Usage'' (1991) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]]'s ''Symposium''.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 119n&lt;/ref&gt;

==Love and hate in Freud’s work==
[[Ambivalence]] was the term borrowed by [[Sigmund Freud]] to indicate the simultaneous presence of [[love]] and [[hate]] towards the same object.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) P. 118-9&lt;/ref&gt; While the roots of ambivalence can be traced back to breast-feeding in the [[oral stage]], it was re-inforced during toilet-training as well.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''Sex in Human Loving'' (1974) p. 222&lt;/ref&gt; Freudian followers such as [[Karl Abraham]] and [[Erik H. Erikson]] distinguished between an early sub-stage with no ambivalence at all towards the mother’s breast, and a later oral-sadistic sub-phase where the biting activity emerges and the phenomenon of ambivalence appears for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Erik Erikson, ''Childhood and Society'' (1973) p. 66-74&lt;/ref&gt; The child is interested in both libidinal and aggressive gratifications, and the mother’s breast is at the same time loved and hated.

While during the [[pre-oedipal]] stages ambivalent feelings are expressed in a dyadic relationship between the mother and the child, during the [[oedipal conflict]] ambivalence is experienced for the first time within a triangular context which involves the child, the mother and the father. In this stage, both the boy and the girl develop negative feelings of jealousy, hostility and rivalry toward the parent of the same sex, but with different mechanisms for the two sexes.  The boy’s attachment to his mother becomes stronger, and he starts developing negative feelings of rivalry and hostility toward the father. The boy wishes to destroy the father so that he can become his mother’s unique love object. On the other hand, the girl starts a love relationship with her father. The mother is seen by the girl as a competitor for the father’s love and so the girl starts feeling hostility and jealousy towards her. The negative feelings which arise in this phase coexist with love and affection toward the parent of the same sex and result in an ambivalence which is expressed in feelings, behavior and fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Case Studies II'' (PFL 9) p. 60-3&lt;/ref&gt; The negative feelings are a source of [[anxiety]] for the child who is afraid that the parent of the same sex would take revenge on him/her. In order to lessen the anxiety, the child activates the [[defense mechanism]] of [[identification (psychology)|identification]], and identifies with the parent of the same sex. This process leads to the formation of the Super-Ego.

According to Freud, ambivalence is the precondition for melancholia, together with loss of a loved object, oral regression and discharge of the aggression toward the self. In this condition, the ambivalently loved object is introjected, and the libido is withdrawn into the self in order to establish identification with the loved object.&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; The object loss then turns into an ego loss and the conflict between the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]] and the Super-Ego becomes manifested. The same ambivalence occurs in the obsessional neurosis, but there it remains related to the outside object.

==In the work of Melanie Klein==

The [[object relations theory]] of [[Melanie Klein]] pivoted around the importance of love and hate, concern for and destruction of others, from infancy onwards.&lt;ref&gt;P. Marcus/A. Rosenberg, ''Psychoanalytic Versions of the Human Condition'' (1998) p. 118-120&lt;/ref&gt; Klein stressed the importance of inborn [[aggression]] as a reflection of the [[death drive]] and talked about the battle of love and hatred throughout the life span. As life begins, the first object for the infant to relate with the external world is the mother. It is there that both good and bad aspects of the self are split and projected as love and hatred to the mother and the others around her later on: as analyst, she would find herself split similarly into a “nice” and a “bad” Mrs Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Julia Segal, ''Melanie Klein'' (2001) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|paranoid-schizoid position]], the infant sees objects around it either as good or bad, according to his/her experiences with them. They are felt to be loving and good when the infant’s wishes are gratified and happy feelings prevail. On the other hand, objects are seen as bad when the infant’s wishes are not met adequately and frustration prevails. In the child’s world there is not yet a distinction between fantasy and reality; loving and hating experiences towards the good and bad objects are believed to have an actual impact on the surrounding objects. Therefore, the infant must keep these loving and hating emotions as distinct as possible, because of the [[paranoid anxiety]] that the destructive force of the bad object will destroy the loving object from which the infant gains refuge against the bad objects. The mother must be either good or bad and the feeling experienced is either love or hate.

However, later in development, these emotions start to get integrated, in a natural process. As the infant’s potential to tolerate ambivalent feelings with the [[Paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions|depressive position]], the infant starts forming a perception of the objects around it as both good and bad, thus tolerating the coexistence of these two opposite feelings for the same object where experience had previously been either idealised or dismissed as bad, the good object can be accepted as frustrating without losing its acceptable status.&lt;ref&gt;Hanna Segal, ''Introduction to the World of Melanie Klein'' (1964) p. 106-7&lt;/ref&gt; When this takes place, the previous paranoid anxiety (that the bad object will destroy everything) transforms into a [[depressive anxiety]]; this is the intense fear that the child’s own destructiveness (hate) will damage the beloved others. Subsequently, for the coexistence of love and hate to be attainable, the child must believe in her ability to contain hate, without letting it destroy the loving objects. He/she must believe in the prevalence of the loving feelings over his/her aggressiveness. Since this ambivalent state is hard to preserve, under difficult circumstances it is lost, and the person returns to the previous manner keeping love and hate distinct for a period of time until he/she is able to regain the capacity for ambivalence.

==In the work of Ian Suttie==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

[[Ian Dishart Suttie]] (1898-1935) wrote the book ''[[The Origins of Love and Hate]]'', which was first published in 1935, a few days after his death. He was born in Glasgow and was the third of four children. His father was a general practitioner, and Ian Suttie and both of his brothers and his sister became doctors as well. He qualified from Glasgow University in 1914. After a year he went into psychiatry.

Although his work has been out of print in England for some years, it is still relevant today.{{dubious|date=May 2013}} It has been often cited and makes a contribution towards understanding the more difficult aspects of family relationships and friendships.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} He can be seen as one of the first significant [[Object relations theory|object relations theorists]] and his ideas anticipated the concepts put forward by modern self psychologists.

Although Ian Suttie was working within the tradition set by Freud, there were a lot of concepts of Freud’s theory he disagreed with. First of all, Suttie saw sociability, the craving for companionship, the need to love and be loved, to exchange and to participate, to be as primary as sexuality itself. And in contrast with Freud he didn’t see sociability and love simply as a derivative from sexuality. Secondly, Ian Suttie explained anxiety and neurotic maladjustment, as a reaction on the failure of finding a response for this sociability; when primary social love and tenderness fails to find the response it seeks, the arisen frustration will produce a kind of [[separation anxiety]]. This view is more clearly illustrated by a piece of writing of Suttie himself: ‘Instead of an armament of instincts, latent or otherwise, the child is born with a simple attachment-to-mother who is the sole source of food and protection… the need for a mother is primarily presented to the child mind as a need for company and as a discomfort in isolation’.

Ian [[Suttie]] saw the infant as striving from the first to relate to his mother, and future mental health would depend on the success or failure of this first relationship ([[object relations]]). Another advocate of the object relations paradigm is [[Melanie Klein]]. Object relations was in contrast with Freud’s [[psychoanalysis]]. The advocates of this object relations paradigm all, in exception of Melanie Klein, held the opinion that most differences in individual development that are of importance for mental health could be traced to differences in the way children were treated by their parents or to the loss or separation of parent-figures. In the explanation of the love and hate relationship by Ian Suttie, the focus, not surprisingly, lies in relations and the social environment. According to Suttie, Freud saw love and hate as two distinct instincts. Hate had to be overcome with love, and because both terms are seen as two different instincts, this means [[psychological repression|repression]]. In Suttie’s view however, this is incompatible with the other Freudian view that life is a struggle to attain peace by the release of the impulse. These inconsistencies would be caused by leaving out the social situations and motives. Suttie saw hate as the frustration aspect of love. “The greater the love, the greater the hate or jealousy caused by its frustration and the greater the ambivalence or guilt that may arise in relation to it.” Hate has to be overcome with love by the child removing the cause of the anxiety and hate by restoring harmonious relationships. The feeling of anxiety and hate can then change back into the feeling of love and security. This counts for the situation between mother and child and later for following relationships.

In Suttie’s view, the beginning of the relationship between mother and child is a happy and symbiotic one as well. This happy symbiotic relationship between mother and baby can be disrupted by for example a second baby or the mother returning to work. This makes the infant feel irritable, insecure and anxious. This would be the start of the feeling of [[ambivalence]]: feelings of [[love]] and [[hate]] towards the mother. The child attempts to remove the cause of the anxiety and hate to restore the relationship (retransforming). This retransforming is necessary, because hate of a loved object ([[ambivalence]]) is intolerable.

==In the work of Edith Jacobson==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}

The newborn baby is not able to distinguish the self from others and the relationship with the mother is symbiotic, with the two individuals forming a unique object. In this period, the child generates two different images of the mother.  On one hand there is the loving mother, whose image derives from experiences of love and satisfaction in the relationship with her. On the other hand, there is the bad mother, whose image derives from frustrating and upsetting experiences in the relationship. Since the child at this stage is unable to distinguish the self from the other, those two opposite images are often fused and confused, rather than distinguished. At about six months of age, the child becomes able to distinguish the self from the others. He now understands that his mother can be both gratifying and frustrating, and he starts experiencing himself as being able to feel both love and anger. This ambivalence results in a vacillation between attitudes of passive dependency on the omnipotent mother and aggressive strivings for self expansion and control over the love object. The passive-submissive and active-aggressive behaviour of the child during the [[pre-oedipal]] and the early [[oedipal]] period is determined by his ambivalent emotional fluctuations between loving and trusting admirations of his parents and disappointed depreciation of the loved objects. The [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]] can use this ambivalence conflicts to distinguish between the self and the object. At the beginning, the child tends to turn aggression toward the frustrating objects and libido towards the self. Hence, frustration, demands and restrictions imposed by parents within normal bounds, reinforce the process of discovery and distinction of the object and the self. When early experiences of severe disappointment and abandonment have prevented the building up of un-ambivalent object relations and stable identifications and weakened the child’s self-esteem, they may result in ambivalence conflict in adulthood, which in turn causes depressive states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4445">A '''Martian scientist''' or '''Martian researcher''' is a hypothetical [[Martian]] frequently used in [[thought experiment]]s as an outside observer of conditions on [[Earth]]. The most common variety is the '''Martian [[anthropology|anthropologist]]''', but Martians researching subjects such as [[philosophy]], [[linguistics]] and [[biology]] have also been invoked.

The following extract from an essay by [[Richard Dawkins]] is more or less typical.
:''A Martian [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomist]] who didn't know that all human [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] happily interbreed with one another, and didn't know that most of the underlying [[genetics|genetic]] variance in our [[species]] is shared by all races might be tempted by our regional differences in skin colour, facial features, hair, body size and proportions to split us into more than one species.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Dawkins|Dawkins R]]. ''A Devil's Chaplain: Selected Essays''. Phoenix, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson; 2003. {{ISBN|0-297-82973-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In American [[structuralism|structuralist]] [[linguistics]], the Martian approach is recommended for [[Descriptive linguistics|language description]]:
:''The descriptive analyst must be guided by certain very fixed [[principle]]s if he is to be [[Objectivity (science)|objective]] in describing accurately any [[language]] or part of any language. It would be excellent if he could adopt a completely man-from-Mars attitude toward any language he analyzes and describes.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Nida|Nida E]]. ''Morphology: the descriptive analysis of words''. 2nd ed. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press; 1949. p 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothetical Martian anthropologist is described in the writings of [[Noam Chomsky]] as one who, upon studying the world's languages, would conclude that they are all dialects of a single language embodying a "[[universal grammar]]" reflecting a hardwired, genetically determined linguistic module inherent in the human brain.

In [[philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of language]] and [[philosophy of mind]], the Martian is often invoked as an example of an intelligent being with a cognitive apparatus that differs from that of humans, e.g. the following example given by [[Saul Kripke]]:

:''I will not here argue that simplicity is relative, or that it is hard to define, or that a Martian might find the quus function simpler than the plus function.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Saul Kripke|Kripke, Saul]].  ''Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language: An Elementary Exposition'', Harvard University Press. p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

In a common [[rhetoric]]al turn, invoking the Martian scientist forces the reader to observe an obvious state of affairs that is ordinarily overlooked:
:''If a Martian graced our planet, it would be struck by one remarkable similarity among Earth's living creatures and a key difference.''&lt;ref&gt;Hauser MD, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky N]], Fitch WT. The Faculty of Language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve? ''Science''. 2002;298(5598):1569-79. {{DOI|10.1126/science.298.5598.1569}} {{PMID|12446899}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(NB: The similarity Chomsky et al. mean is the universal hereditary language of DNA, while the difference is the lack of a universal language of communication.)

{{merge from|Nicaragua Creole English Language|date=June 2017}}

'''Mískito Coast Creole''' or '''Nicaragua Creole English''' is a language spoken in [[Nicaragua]] based on [[English language|English]]. Its approximately 30,000 speakers are found along the [[Mosquito Coast]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=bzk Nicaragua Creole English] [[Ethnologue]] report&lt;/ref&gt; The language is nearly identical to [[Belizean Creole language|Belizean Creole]], and similar to all [[Central America]]n Creoles. It is a dialect of [[Jamaican Patois]]. It does not have the status of an official language.

==Geographic distribution==
Speakers of Miskito Coast Creole are primarily persons of [[Africa]]n, [[Amerindian]], and [[Europe]]an descent in the towns and on the offshore islands of the Miskito Coast. The main concentration of speakers is around [[Bluefields]], capital of the [[South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region]], although a majority of inhabitants of the city are now [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking immigrants.

Other communities of [[Creole peoples|Creole]]s are found in [[Waspán]] on the [[Coco River]] near [[Cape Gracias a Dios]], in [[Laguna de Perlas]], [[Puerto Cabezas]], the offshore [[Corn Islands]], [[Prinzapolka]] (Puerto Isabel), and [[San Juan del Norte]] (Greytown). Inland, the language is spoken in [[Siuna]], [[Rosita, North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|Rosita]], and [[Bonanza, North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|Bonanza]] on the [[Prinzapolka River]]. On the Pacific coast, there are small numbers of speakers in [[Corinto, Nicaragua|Corinto]], [[Puerto Sandino]], and the Nicaraguan capital of [[Managua]].

[[Rama Cay Creole]] is a variety of the language spoken by the [[Rama (people)|Rama people]] on [[Rama Cay]], an island in the Bluefields Lagoon.

==History==
African slaves were shipwrecked on the Mosquito Coast as early as 1640 and interaction between them and the local [[Miskito people|Miskito]] population commenced. Larger numbers of Africans from [[Jamaica]] enslaved by [[British Empire|British]] owners were settled in the area during the 18th century which led to the development of Miskito Coastal Creole. The Coast was officially under British [[protectorate|protection]] from 1740 to 1787 according to the [[Treaty of Friendship and Alliance]] with the [[Miskito people#British Miskito Alliance|Miskito Kingdom]] and remained under British influence until the late 19th century. In the mid-19th century, more English- or Creole-speaking laborers, primarily from Jamaica, were brought to the Coast as laborers.

However, following the 1894 formal annexation of the Miskito Kingdom by Nicaragua, an increasing number of Spanish speakers migrated to the area. The 1987 [[Constitution of Nicaragua]] granted autonomy to the [[Zelaya Department]] as two [[Autonomous region|autonomous regions]] of the [[North Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|North]] and [[South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region|South Caribbean Coast]]. Autonomous status has allowed for the promotion and development of the languages of the Caribbean Coast and, {{as of|1992|lc=on}}, there was an education in English and Spanish, as well as education in indigenous languages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

}} Quote: Montreal "is second only to Paris as the largest primarily French-speaking city in the world".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kinshasa and Abidjan are sometimes said to rank ahead of Montreal as francophone cities, since they have larger populations and are in countries with French as the sole official language. However, French is uncommon as a mother tongue there. According to Ethnologue, there were 17,500 mother-tongue speakers of French in the Ivory Coast as of 1988.

==Name==
In the [[Mohawk language]], the island is called {{lang|moh|Tiohtià:ke Tsi}}. It is a name referring to the [[Lachine Rapids]] to the island's southwest or {{lang|moh|Ka-wé-no-te}}. It means "a place where nations and rivers unite and divide".{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In the [[Ojibwe language]], the land is called {{lang|oj|Mooniyaang}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onishka.org/art-et-communaute/|title=Onishka –   Art et Communaute|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220164827/http://onishka.org/art-et-communaute/|archivedate=February 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means "the first stopping place"{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} and is part of the [[seven fires prophecy]].

The city was first named {{lang|fr|[[Fort Ville-Marie|Ville Marie]]}} by European settlers from [[La Flèche]], or "City of Mary",&lt;ref name="vieux.montreal.qc.ca"/&gt; named for the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kalbfleisch |first=John |title=Founding of Ville-Marie |url=http://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/french-canada/founding-of-ville-marie |publisher=[[Canada's National History Society]] |accessdate=6 July 2018 |date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its current name comes from [[Mount Royal]],&lt;ref name="montreal.about.com"/&gt; the triple-peaked hill in the heart of the city. According to one theory, the name derives from {{lang|fr|mont Réal}}, ({{lang|fr|Mont Royal}} in modern French, although in 16th-century French the terms {{lang|fr|réal}} and {{lang|fr|royal}} were used interchangeably); Cartier's 1535 diary entry, naming the mountain, refers to {{lang|fr|le mont Royal}}.&lt;ref name="montrealgazette.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/how-should-one-pronounce-montreal-a-historical-and-linguistic-guide |title=how should one pronounce montreal? a historical and linguistic guide|date=July 15, 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A possibility by the [[Government of Canada]] on its web site concerning Canadian place names, is that the name was adopted as it is written nowadays because an early map of 1556 used the Italian name of the mountain, {{lang|it|Monte Real}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Resources Canada, Origins of Geographical Names: Island of Montréal.|url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography-boundary/geographical-name/geoname-origins/5831 |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703070417/https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/geography-boundary/geographical-name/geoname-origins/5831|archivedate=July 3, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; this misconception has been dismissed by the [[Commission de toponymie du Québec]].&lt;ref name="montrealgazette.com"/&gt;

According to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, the Commission de toponymie du Québec, and the [[Geographical Names Board of Canada]], the names of Canadian cities and towns have only one official form. Thus, Montréal is officially spelled with an accented é in both Canadian English and French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/wrtps/index-eng.html?lang=eng&amp;lettr=indx_catlog_m&amp;page=9IenJvUZtkOk.html |title=Montréal, Montréaler, Montrealer |publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada |date=2016 |accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/abt-aps/stgd-gdst/index-eng.htm#toc2.15 |title=Names (geographical) |publisher=Public Service Commission of Canada |accessdate=October 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&amp;lettr=chapsect15&amp;info0=15#zz15 |title=Geographical Names |publisher=The Canadian Style |accessdate=October 29, 2016 |author=Government of Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the accent in both ''Montreal'' and ''Quebec'' are often omitted in common English usage.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Pre-European contact===
[[File:Jacques Cartier a Hochelaga.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Cartier]] at [[Hochelaga (village)|Hochelaga]]. Arriving in 1535, Cartier was the first European to visit the area.]]
[[Archaeological]] evidence demonstrates that [[First Nations]] native people occupied the island of Montreal as early as 4,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Centre d'histoire de Montréal. ''Le Montréal des Premières Nations.'' 2011. P. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; By the year AD 1000, they had started to cultivate [[maize]].

Archeologists have found evidence of their habitation there and at other locations in the valley since at least the 14th&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name="Tremblay"&gt;{{cite book |first=Roland|last=Tremblay|year=2006|title=The Saint Lawrence Iroquoians. Corn People.|location=Montréal, Québec, Canada|publisher=Les Éditions de l'Homme}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] visited ''Hochelaga'' on October 2, 1535, and estimated the population of the native people at Hochelaga to be "over a thousand people".&lt;ref name="Tremblay"/&gt; Evidence of earlier occupation of the island, such as those uncovered in 1642 during the construction of Fort Ville-Marie, have effectively been removed.

===Early European settlement (1600–1760)===
Seventy years later, the French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] reported that the St&amp;nbsp;Lawrence Iroquoians and their settlements had disappeared altogether from the St&amp;nbsp;Lawrence valley. This is believed to be due to outmigration, epidemics of European diseases, or intertribal wars.&lt;ref name="Tremblay"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=T3NQ1lsaHs0C&amp;pg=PA214 Bruce G.

[[File:Capitulation Montreal.jpg|thumb|French authorities surrender the city of Montreal to the British after the [[Articles of Capitulation of Montreal|Articles of Capitulation]] was signed in 1760.]]
[[Jérome le Royer de la Dauversiere|Dauversiere]] hired [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], then 30, to lead a group of colonists to build a mission on his new seigneury. The colonists left France in 1641 for Quebec, and arrived on the island the following year. On May 17, 1642, Ville-Marie was founded on the southern shore of Montreal island, with Maisonneuve as its first governor. The settlement included a chapel and a hospital, under the command of [[Jeanne Mance]].&lt;ref name="Miquelon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/ville-marie-colony/|title=Ville-Marie (Colony)|last=Miquelon|first=Dale|publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1643, Ville-Marie had already been attacked by Iroquois raids. In the spring of 1651, the Iroquois attacks became so frequent and so violent that Ville Marie thought its end had come. Maisonneuve made all the settlers take refuge in the fort. By 1652 the colony at Montreal had been so reduced that he was forced to return to France to raise 100 volunteers to go with him to the colony the following year. If the effort had failed, Montreal was to be abandoned and the survivors re-located downriver to Quebec City. Before these 100 arrived in the fall of 1653, the population of Montreal was barely 50 people.

By 1685 Ville Marie was home to some 600 colonists, most of them living in modest wooden houses. Ville Marie became a centre for the [[fur trade]] and a base for further [[French colonization of the Americas|exploration]].&lt;ref name="Miquelon"/&gt; In 1689 the English-allied Iroquois attacked [[Lachine massacre|Lachine]] on the Island of Montreal, committing the worst massacre in the history of New France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L6yBv0obAV4C|title=Battlefields of Canada|last=Beacock Fryer|first=Mary|year=1986|publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd|isbn=1-55002-007-2|page=247|accessdate=November 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 18th century, the [[Sulpician Order]] was established there. To encourage French settlement, they wanted the Mohawk to move away from the fur trading post at Ville Marie. They had a mission village, known as [[Kahnewake]], south of the St Lawrence River. The fathers persuaded some Mohawk to make a new settlement at their former hunting grounds north of the Ottawa River. This became [[Kanesatake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfb.ca/film/kanehsatake_270_years_of_resistance/ |title=Alanis Obomsawin, ''Kanesatake: 270 Years of Resistance'', National Film Board of Canada, 1993, accessed Jan 30, 2010 |publisher=National Film Board of Canada |date=February 5, 2010 |accessdate=April 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1745 several Mohawk families moved upriver to create another settlement, known as [[Akwesasne]]. All three are now Mohawk reserves in Canada. The Canadian territory was ruled as a French colony until 1760, when it was surrendered to Great Britain after the [[Seven Years' War]].&lt;ref name="Encarta"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461511335/articles_of_the_capitulation_of_montreal_1760.html |title=Articles of the Capitulation of Montréal, 1760 |year=1760 |publisher=MSN Encarta |accessdate=March 29, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kx5IOka6?url=http://ca.encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461511335/articles_of_the_capitulation_of_montreal_1760.html |archivedate=November 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century maintaining Montreal's drinking water became increasingly difficult with the rapid increase in population. A majority of the drinking water was still coming from the city's harbor, which was busy and heavily trafficked leading to the deterioration of the water within. In the mid 1840s the City of Montreal installed a water system that would pump water from the St. Lawrence and into cisterns. The cisterns would then be transported to the desired location. This was not the first water system of its type in Montreal as there had been one in private ownership since 1801. In the middle of the 19th century water distribution was carried out by "fontainiers". The fountainiers would open and close water valves outside of buildings, as directed, all over the city. As they lacked modern plumbing systems it was impossible to connect all buildings at once and it also acted as a conservation method. The population was not finished rising yet however, from 58,000 in 1852 it rose to 267,000 by 1901.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Letty. "Water-supply." Building Canada: A History of Public Works. By Norman R.

Montreal was the capital of the [[Province of Canada]] from 1844 to 1849, but lost its status when a [[Tories#Canada|Tory]] mob [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|burnt down the Parliament]] building to protest the passage of the [[Rebellion Losses Bill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vehiculepress.com/montreal/oldmontreal.html |title=Walking Tour of Old Montreal |work=Vehicule Press |accessdate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For strategic reasons, Queen Victoria herself established [[Ottawa]] as the capital. The reasons were twofold; as it was located more in the interior of the nation, it was less susceptible to US attack. Perhaps more importantly, as it lay on the border between French and English Canada, the small town of Ottawa was seen as a compromise between Montreal, Toronto, Kingston and Quebec City, who were all vying to become the young nation's official capital.

The 1970s ushered in a period of wide-ranging social and political changes, stemming largely from the concerns of the [[French Canadian|French speaking]] majority about the conservation of their culture and language, given the traditional predominance of the [[English-Canadian|English Canadian]] minority in the business arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ville.montreal.qc.ca/archives/500ans/portail_archives_en/rep_chapitre12/chapitre12-3.html|title=A new francophone conquest|work=Montreal Archives Portal|publisher=City of Montreal|accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[October Crisis]] and the 1976 election of the [[Parti Québécois]], supporting sovereign status for Quebec, resulted in the departure of many businesses and people from the city.&lt;ref name="RoughGuide"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bprM-IjxCNIC&amp;pg=PA272|title=The Ongoing Threat of Separatism|last=Bowen|first=Arabella|author2=John Shandy Watson|date=2001–2004|work=The Rough Guide to Montreal|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|page=272|accessdate=March 29, 2009|isbn=978-1-84353-195-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 Montreal was the host of the [[1976 Summer Olympics|Olympics]].&lt;ref name="IOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/montreal-1976-summer-olympics|title=Montreal 1976|work=Olympic Games|publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]]|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s and early 1990s, Montreal experienced a slower rate of economic growth than many other major Canadian cities. Montreal was the site of the 1989 [[École Polytechnique massacre]], Canada's worst [[mass shooting]], where 25-year-old [[Marc Lépine]] shot and killed 14 people, all of them women, and wounding 14 other people before shooting himself at [[École Polytechnique]].

Montreal was [[Montreal Merger|merged]] with the 27 surrounding municipalities on the [[Island of Montreal]] on January 1, 2002, creating a unified city covering the entire island. There was great resistance from the suburbs to the merger, with the perception being that it was forced on the mostly English suburbs by the [[Parti Québécois]]. As expected, this move proved unpopular and several mergers were later rescinded. Several former municipalities, totalling 13% of the population of the island, voted to leave the unified city in separate [[referendum]]s in June 2004. The demerger took place on January 1, 2006, leaving 15 municipalities on the island, including Montreal. De-merged municipalities remain affiliated with the city through an agglomeration council that collects taxes from them to pay for numerous shared services.&lt;ref name="Agglomeration council"&gt;{{cite web |title=Agglomeration council |url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=5977,42239628&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL |publisher=Ville de Montréal |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 mergers were not the first in the city's history. Montreal annexed 27 other cities, towns, and villages beginning with [[Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve#History|Hochelaga]] in 1883 with the last prior to 2002 being [[Pointe-aux-Trembles]] in 1982.

The 21st century has brought with it a revival of the city's economic and cultural landscape. The construction of new residential skyscrapers, two super-hospitals (the [[Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal]] and [[McGill University Health Centre]]), the creation of the [[Quartier des Spectacles]], reconstruction of the [[Turcot Interchange]], reconfiguration of the Decarie and Dorval interchanges, construction of the new [[Réseau électrique métropolitain]], gentrification of [[Griffintown]], subway line extensions and the purchase of new subway cars, the complete revitalization and expansion of [[Montreal-Trudeau International Airport|Trudeau International Airport]], the completion of [[Quebec Autoroute 30]], the reconstruction of the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal|Champlain Bridge]], and the construction of a new toll bridge to Laval are helping Montreal continue to grow.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[File:Montreal Canada from ISS014.jpg|thumb|The [[island of Montreal]] at the confluence of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] and [[Ottawa River|Ottawa]] rivers.]]
Montreal is in the southwest of the province of [[Quebec]]. The city covers most of the [[Island of Montreal]] at the confluence of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint Lawrence]] and [[Ottawa River]]s. The port of Montreal lies at one end of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], the river gateway that stretches from the [[Great Lakes]] to the Atlantic.&lt;ref name="Great Canadian Rivers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatcanadianrivers.com/rivers/stlawer/stlawer-home.html|title=The St. Lawrence River|year=2007|publisher=Great Canadian Rivers|accessdate=May 20, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509075851/http://www.greatcanadianrivers.com/rivers/stlawer/stlawer-home.html|archive-date=May 9, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montreal is defined by its location between the Saint Lawrence river to its south and the [[Rivière des Prairies]] to its north. The city is named after the most prominent geographical feature on the island, a three-head hill called Mount Royal, topped at {{convert|232|m|abbr=off}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].&lt;ref name="Natural Resources Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/montreal_e.php|title=Island of Montreal|date=September 17, 2007|work=Geographical Names of Canada|publisher=Natural Resources Canada|accessdate=May 20, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531042123/http://geonames.nrcan.gc.ca/education/montreal_e.php|archivedate=May 31, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montreal is at the centre of the [[Greater Montreal|Montreal Metropolitan Community]], and is bordered by the city of [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]] to the north; [[Longueuil]], [[Saint-Lambert, Quebec|Saint-Lambert]], [[Brossard]], and other municipalities to the south; [[Repentigny, Quebec|Repentigny]] to the east and the [[West Island]] municipalities to the west. The [[English language|anglophone]] enclaves of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]], [[Montreal West, Quebec|Montreal West]], [[Hampstead, Quebec|Hampstead]], [[Côte Saint-Luc]], the [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Town of Mount Royal]] and the [[francophone]] enclave [[Montréal-Est, Quebec|Montreal East]] are all surrounded by Montreal.&lt;ref name="City Map"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/MTL_STATISTIQUES_FR/media/documents/Decoupage_territoire_montrealais_2006.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5nYMhCpEg?url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/pls/portal/docs/page/MTL_STATISTIQUES_FR/media/documents/Decoupage_territoire_montrealais_2006.pdf |archivedate=February 15, 2010 |title=Découpage du territoire montréalais en 2006 |year=2006 |work=Montréal en statistiques |publisher=Ville de Montréal |language=French |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Montreal is classified as a [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] climate ([[Köppen climate classification]]: Dfa/Dfb).&lt;ref name="Köppen"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://geogratis.gc.ca/api/en/nrcan-rncan/ess-sst/09ffaeb5-ec8f-5bb5-bdcb-3436ccf26f58.html |title = Climatic Regions [Köppen] |work = Atlas of Canada |publisher = Natural Resources Canada |date = June 2003|accessdate = September 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Climate-Data.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate: Montreal – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/3704/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|accessdate=September 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Summers are, on the whole, warm and humid with a daily maximum average of {{convert|26|to|27|°C|°F|0}} in July; temperatures in excess of {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} are common. Conversely, cold fronts can bring crisp, drier and windy weather in the early and later parts of summer.
[[File:Montreal Winter Snowing.jpg|thumb|Winters in Montreal bring cold, snowy, windy, and at times, icy weather.]]
Winter brings cold, snowy, windy, and, at times, icy weather, with a daily average ranging from {{convert|-9|to|-10.5|°C|°F|0}} in January. However, some winter days rise above freezing, allowing for rain on an average of 4 days in January and February each. Usually, snow covering some or all bare ground lasts on average from the first or second week of December until the last week of March.&lt;ref name="CurrentResults.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Montréal Snowfall Totals &amp; Accumulation Averages|url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather/Canada/Quebec/Places/montreal-snowfall-totals-snow-accumulation-averages.php|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the air temperature does not fall below {{convert|-30|°C}} every year,&lt;ref name="Montreal Weather Data"&gt;{{cite web|title=Montréal Weather over the Last 5 Years|url=http://montreal.weatherstats.ca/periods/5years.html|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[wind chill]] often makes the temperature feel this low to exposed skin.

Spring and fall are pleasantly mild but prone to drastic temperature changes; spring even more so than fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criacc.qc.ca/climat/suivi/20degres_e.html |title=First 20 degrees Celsius |publisher=Criacc.qc.ca |accessdate=April 13, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080228140358/http://www.criacc.qc.ca/climat/suivi/20degres_e.html| archivedate = February 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late season heat waves as well as "[[Indian summer]]s" are possible. Early and late season snow storms can occur in November and March, and more rarely in April. Montreal is generally snow free from late April to late October. However, snow can fall in early to mid-October as well as early to mid-May on rare occasions.

The lowest temperature in Environment Canada's books was {{convert|−37.8|°C|0}} on January 15, 1957, and the highest temperature was {{convert|37.6|°C|abbr=on}} on August 1, 1975, both at [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport|Dorval International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climate.weatheroffice.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1961_1990_e.html?stnID=1191&amp;prov=QC&amp;lang=e&amp;StationName=MONTREAL&amp;SearchType=Contains&amp;province=ALL&amp;provBut=&amp;month1=0&amp;month2=12|title=Canadian Climate Normals 1961–1990 Station Data|work=weatheroffice.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual precipitation is around {{convert|1000|mm|0|abbr=on}}, including an average of about {{convert|210|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall, which occurs from November through March. Thunderstorms are common in the period beginning in late spring through summer to early fall; additionally, tropical storms or their remnants can cause heavy rains and gales. Montreal averages 2,050 hours of sunshine annually, with summer being the sunniest season, though slightly wetter than the others in terms of total precipitation—mostly from thunderstorms.&lt;ref name="PET stats"&gt;.{{cite web

==Architecture==
{{Main|Architecture of Montreal}}
[[File:Vieux-Montréal (525744602).jpg|thumb|Many colonial era buildings can be found in [[Old Montreal]] with several dating as far back as the late 17th century.]]
For over a century and a half, Montreal was the industrial and financial centre of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/industrial/intro.html|title=Welcome to Industrial Montreal|publisher=[[McGill University]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legacy has left a variety of buildings including factories, [[Grain elevators|elevators]], [[warehouses]], [[mill (factory)|mills]], and [[refineries]], that today provide an invaluable insight into the city's history, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area. There are 50 [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Montreal|National Historic Sites of Canada]], more than any other city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Montréal|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/lhn-nhs/page3_E.asp?locateinp=Montr%E9al&amp;nhsprov=Quebec&amp;nhschoice=nhsdesig&amp;list4=Generate+List|work=Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of Canada|publisher=[[Parks Canada]]|accessdate=July 31, 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the city's earliest still-standing buildings date back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Although most are clustered around the Old Montreal area, such as the Sulpician Seminary adjacent to Notre Dame Basilica that dates back to 1687, and Château Ramezay, which was built in 1705, examples of early colonial architecture are dotted throughout the city. Situated in Lachine, the Le Ber-Le Moyne House is the oldest complete building in the city. In Point St. Charles visitors can see the Maison Saint-Gabriel, which can trace its history back to 1698.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taylornoakes.com/2013/01/01/the-oldest-buildings-in-montreal/|title=The Oldest Buildings in Montréal|first=Taylor C.|last=Noakes|date=January 1, 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many historic buildings in Old Montreal in their original form: [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica|Notre Dame of Montreal Basilica]], [[Bonsecours Market]], and the 19th‑century headquarters of all major Canadian banks on [[Saint Jacques Street|St. James Street]] (French: Rue Saint Jacques). Montreal's earliest buildings are characterized by their uniquely French influence and grey stone construction.
[[File:Habitat-67 side view with holes visible in the structure.jpg|thumb|left|[[Habitat 67]] is a model community and housing complex developed for [[Expo 67]] [[World Fair]].]]
[[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], completed in 1967, [[Ernest Cormier]]'s [[Art Deco]] [[Université de Montréal]] main building, the landmark [[Place Ville Marie]] office tower, the controversial [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] and surrounding structures, are but a few notable examples of the city's 20th-century architecture. Pavilions designed for the 1967 International and Universal Exposition, popularly known as [[Expo&amp;nbsp;67]], featured a wide range of architectural designs. Though most pavilions were temporary structures, several have become landmarks, including Buckminster Fuller's [[geodesic dome]] U.S.&amp;nbsp;Pavilion, now the [[Montreal Biosphere]], and [[Moshe Safdie]]'s striking [[Habitat&amp;nbsp;67]] apartment complex.

The [[Montreal Metro]] has public artwork by some of the biggest names in [[Culture of Quebec|Quebec culture]].

In 2006 Montreal was named a [[UNESCO]] City of Design, only one of three design capitals of the world (the others being [[Berlin]] and [[Buenos Aires]]).&lt;ref name="UNESCO"/&gt; This distinguished title recognizes Montreal's design community. Since 2005 the city has been home for the [[International Council of Graphic Design Associations]] (Icograda);&lt;ref name="ICOGRADA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icograda.org/about/contact.htm|title=CONTACT|work=About|publisher=Icograda|accessdate=August 1, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404233133/http://www.icograda.org/about/contact.htm|archivedate=April 4, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the International Design Alliance (IDA).&lt;ref name="BNET"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-13699039.html|title=The International Design Alliance Settles in Montreal|date=May 30, 2005|publisher=Canadian Corporate News (CCNMatthews Newswire)|accessdate=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Underground City, Montreal|Underground City]] (officially RESO) is an important tourist attraction. It is the set of interconnected shopping complexes (both above and below ground). This impressive network connects pedestrian thoroughfares to universities, as well as hotels, restaurants, bistros, subway stations and more, in and around downtown with {{convert|32|km|mi|abbr=off}} of tunnels over {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|spell=in|lk=out|abbr=off}} of the most densely populated part of Montreal.

==Neighbourhoods==
{{Main|List of neighbourhoods in Montreal}}
{{See also|Boroughs of Montreal}}
[[File:ArrondissementsQuartiersMontreal.svg|thumb|Map of neighbourhoods on the island of Montreal.]]
The city is composed of 19 large [[Boroughs of Montreal|boroughs]], subdivided into neighbourhoods.&lt;ref name="Bits"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealbits.com/neighbourhoods.html|title=Neighbourhoods|date=2005–2009|work=Gromco, Inc.|publisher=Montreal Bits|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The boroughs are:
[[Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grâce|Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grace]], [[Le Plateau-Mont-Royal|The Plateau Mount Royal]], [[Outremont (borough)|Outremont]] and [[Ville-Marie (Montreal)|Ville Marie]] in the centre; [[Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]], [[Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie]] and [[Villeray–Saint-Michel–Parc-Extension]] in the east; [[Anjou (borough)|Anjou]], [[Montréal-Nord]], [[Rivière-des-Prairies–Pointe-aux-Trembles]] and [[Saint-Leonard, Quebec|Saint-Leonard]] in the northeast; [[Ahuntsic-Cartierville]], [[L'Île-Bizard–Sainte-Geneviève]], [[Pierrefonds-Roxboro]] and [[Saint-Laurent (borough)|Saint-Laurent]] in the northwest; and [[Lachine (borough)|Lachine]], [[LaSalle (borough)|LaSalle]], [[Le Sud-Ouest|The South West]] and [[Verdun (borough)|Verdun]] in the south.

Many of these boroughs were independent cities that were forced to be merged with Montreal in January 2002 following the [[2002-2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal|2002 Municipal Reorganization of Montreal]].
[[File:Montreal August 2017 05.jpg|thumb|left|A view of [[Downtown Montreal]] from [[Mont Royal]]. Many neighbourhoods, including downtown, are located in the borough of [[Ville-Marie, Montreal|Ville-Marie]].]]
The borough with the most neighbourhoods is Ville Marie, which includes [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]], the historical district of [[Old Montreal]], [[Chinatown (Montreal)|Chinatown]], the [[Gay Village, Montreal|Gay Village]], the [[Quartier Latin, Montreal|Latin Quarter]], the gentrified [[Quartier international de Montréal|Quartier international]] and [[Cité Multimédia]] as well as the [[Quartier des Spectacles]] which is under development. Other neighbourhoods of interest in the borough include the affluent [[Golden Square Mile]] neighbourhood at the foot of [[Mount Royal]] and the [[Shaughnessy Village]]/[[Quartier Concordia|Concordia U]] area home to thousands of students at [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]]. The borough also comprises most of [[Mount Royal Park]], [[Saint Helen's Island]], and [[Île Notre-Dame|Notre-Dame Island]].

The [[Plateau]] Mount Royal borough was a working class francophone area. The largest neighbourhood is [[the Plateau]] (not to be confused with the whole borough), which is undergoing considerable gentrification,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barbonne|first=Rémy|title=Gentrification, nouvel urbanisme et évolution de la mobilité quotidienne : vers un développement plus durable ?

The [[McGill Ghetto]] is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough, its name being derived from the fact that it is home to thousands of [[McGill University]] students and faculty members.

The South West borough was home to much of the city's industry during the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th century. The borough included [[Goose Village, Montreal|Goose Village]] and is home to the traditionally working-class [[Irish Quebecer|Irish]] neighbourhoods of [[Griffintown]] and [[Pointe-Saint-Charles|Point Saint Charles]] as well as the low-income neighbourhoods of [[Saint-Henri|Saint Henri]] and [[Little Burgundy]].

Other notable neighbourhoods include the multicultural areas of [[Notre-Dame-de-Grâce]] and [[Côte-des-Neiges]] in the Côte-des-Neiges–Notre-Dame-de-Grace borough, and [[Little Italy, Montreal|Little Italy]] in the borough of Rosemont–La Petite-Patrie and [[Hochelaga-Maisonneuve]], home of the [[Olympic Stadium, Montreal|Olympic Stadium]] in the borough of Mercier–Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.

===Old Montreal===
{{Main|Old Montreal}}
[[File:Place Jacques-Cartier Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|[[Place Jacques-Cartier]] is a major [[public square]] and attraction in [[Old Montreal]].]]
Old Montreal is a historic area southeast of downtown containing many attractions such as the [[Old Port of Montreal]], [[Place Jacques-Cartier]], [[Montreal City Hall]], the [[Bonsecours Market]], Place d'Armes, [[Pointe-à-Callière Museum]], the [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica]], and the [[Montreal Science Centre]].

Architecture and cobbled streets in Old Montreal have been maintained or restored and are frequented by horse-drawn [[calèche|buggies]] carrying tourists. Old Montreal is accessible from the downtown core via the [[underground city, Montreal|underground city]] and is served by several [[Société de transport de Montréal|STM]] bus routes and Metro stations, ferries to the South Shore and a network of bicycle paths.

The riverside area adjacent to Old Montreal is known as the Old Port. The Old Port was the site of the [[Port of Montreal]], but its shipping operations have been moved to a larger site downstream, leaving the former location as a recreational and historical area maintained by [[Parks Canada]]. The new Port of Montreal is Canada's largest container port and the largest inland port on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.port-montreal.com/news/fr_62_1.pdf|title=The Growing Importance of the Container Trade for the Port of Montreal and the Accompanying Business Concentration; How to Diversify its Operational and Financial Risk|last=Taddeo|first=D.J.|date=December 23, 1996|publisher=[[Port of Montreal]]|accessdate=August 3, 2008|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819220327/http://www.port-montreal.com/news/fr_62_1.pdf|archivedate=August 19, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mount Royal===
{{Main|Mount Royal}}
The mountain is the site of Mount Royal Park, one of Montreal's largest [[Open space reserve|greenspaces]]. The park, most of which is wooded, was designed by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], who also designed New York's [[Central Park]], and was inaugurated in 1876.&lt;ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/en/learn-about-mount-royal/short-history-of-mount-royal.sn|title=Short History of Mount Royal|last=Berryman |first=Tom|publisher=Les amis de la montagne|accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mtroyal.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Mont-Royal]]'s eastern slope from the [[George-Étienne Cartier]] monument. The park is one of Montreal's largest [[open space reserve]]s.]]
The park contains two [[belvedere (structure)|belvederes]], the more prominent of which is the Kondiaronk Belvedere, a semicircular plaza with a [[chalet]] overlooking Downtown Montreal. Other features of the park are Beaver Lake, a small man-made lake, a short [[skiing|ski]] [[Ski slope|slope]], a [[sculpture garden]], Smith House, an [[interpretive centre]], and a well-known monument to Sir [[George-Étienne Cartier]]. The park hosts athletic, tourist and cultural activities.

The mountain is home to two major cemeteries, Notre-Dame-des-Neiges (founded in 1854) and Mount Royal (1852). [[Mount Royal Cemetery]] is a {{convert|165|acre|ha}} terraced cemetery on the north slope of Mount Royal in the borough of Outremont. [[Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery]] is much larger, predominantly French-Canadian and officially Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cimetierenddn.org/en/cemetery/mission.aspx |title=Notre-Dame-des-Neiges Cemetery Mission |publisher=Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges |accessdate=September 1, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091223013938/http://www.cimetierenddn.org/en/cemetery/mission.aspx |archivedate=December 23, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 900,000 people are buried there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemontroyal.qc.ca/carte/en/html//The-cemeteries-of-Mount-Royal-38.html|title=The cemeteries of Mount Royal|publisher=Les amis de la montagne |accessdate=February 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mount Royal Cemetery contains more than 162,000 graves and is the final resting place for a number of notable Canadians. It includes a veterans section with several soldiers who were awarded the [[British Empire]]'s highest military honour, the [[Victoria Cross]]. In 1901 the Mount Royal Cemetery Company established the first crematorium in Canada.&lt;ref name="MountRoyalCemetery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mountroyalcem.com/index.php/en/canadas-first-crematorium.html|title=Mount Royal Crematorium|year=2010|publisher=[[Mount Royal Cemetery]]|accessdate=August 12, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117011634/http://mountroyalcem.com/index.php/en/canadas-first-crematorium.html|archivedate=January 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Mount Royal Cross|cross]] on the mountain was placed there in 1643 by [[Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve]], the founder of the city, in fulfilment of a vow he made to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] when [[prayer|praying]] to her to stop a disastrous flood.&lt;ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/&gt; Today, the mountain is crowned by a 31.4 m-high (103&amp;nbsp;ft) illuminated cross, installed in 1924 by the [[Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste|John the Baptist Society]] and now owned by the city.&lt;ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/&gt; It was converted to [[optical fibre|fibre optic]] light in 1992.&lt;ref name="LesAmisDeLaMontagne"/&gt; The new system can turn the lights red, blue, or purple, the last of which is used as a sign of mourning between the death of the Pope and the election of the next.&lt;ref name="Hour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438|title=The future of the Mount Royal cross|last=Silverman|first=Craig|date=June 14, 2004|publisher=[[Hour (magazine)|Hour]]|accessdate=February 26, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105013920/http://www.hour.ca/news/brief.aspx?iIDArticle=3438|archivedate=January 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Montreal}}
Montreal was referred to as "Canada's Cultural Capital" by [[Monocle (2007 magazine)|''Monocle'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="Monocle"/&gt; The city is Canada's centre for French-language television productions, radio, theatre, film, multimedia, and print publishing. Montreal's many cultural communities have given it a distinct local culture.
[[File:Montreal Clock Tower, Fireworks.jpg|left|thumb|[[L'International des Feux Loto-Québec|Montreal Fireworks Festival]] is the world's largest annual fireworks festival. The city hosts a number of festivals annually.]]
As a [[North American]] city, Montreal shares many cultural characteristics with the rest of the continent. It has a tradition of producing both jazz and rock music. The city has also produced much talent in the fields of visual arts, theatre, music, and dance. Yet, being at the confluence of the French and the English traditions, Montreal has developed a unique and distinguished cultural face. Another distinctive characteristic of cultural life is the animation of its [[Downtown Montreal|downtown]], particularly during summer, prompted by cultural and social events, particularly festivals. The city's largest festival is the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]], which is the largest jazz festival in the world. Other popular festivals include the [[Just for Laughs]] (largest comedy festival in the world), [[Montreal World Film Festival]], [[Les FrancoFolies de Montréal]], [[Nuits d'Afrique]], [[Pop Montreal]], [[Divers/Cité]], [[Fierté Montréal]] and the [[Montreal Fireworks Festival]]. There are many smaller festivals, totalling over 100 each year in Montreal.

A cultural heart of classical art and the venue for many summer festivals, the [[Place des Arts]] is a complex of different concert and theatre halls surrounding a large square in the eastern portion of downtown. Place des Arts has the headquarters of one of the world's foremost orchestras, the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]]. The [[Orchestre Métropolitain du Grand Montréal]] and the chamber orchestra [[I Musici de Montréal]] are two other well-regarded Montreal orchestras. Also performing at Place des Arts are the [[Opéra de Montréal]] and the city's chief ballet company [[Les Grands Ballets Canadiens]]. Internationally recognized avant-garde dance troupes such as [[Compagnie Marie Chouinard]], [[La La La Human Steps]], [[O Vertigo]], and the [[Jean-Pierre Perreault|Fondation Jean-Pierre Perreault]] have toured the world and worked with international popular artists on videos and concerts. The unique choreography of these troupes has paved the way for the success of the world-renowned [[Cirque du Soleil]].

Nicknamed ''{{lang|fr|la ville aux cent clochers}}'' (the city of a hundred steeples), Montreal is renowned for its churches. As [[Mark Twain]] noted, "This is the first time I was ever in a city where you couldn't throw a brick without breaking a church window."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Twain |title=MARK TWAIN IN MONTREAL |url=http://www.twainquotes.com/18811210.html |work=New York Times |publisher=twainquotes.com |date=December 10, 1881 |accessdate=February 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has four Roman Catholic [[basilica]]s: [[Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral]], the aforementioned [[Notre-Dame de Montréal Basilica|Notre-Dame Basilica]], [[St. Patrick's Basilica, Montreal|St Patrick's Basilica]], and [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]]. The Oratory is the largest church in Canada, with the second largest copper dome in the world, after [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aviewoncities.com/montreal/oratoirestjoseph.htm|title=St. Joseph Oratory|year=2009|publisher=A view on cities|accessdate=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
{{Main|Sports in Montreal}}
The most popular sport is [[ice hockey]]. The professional hockey team, the [[Montreal Canadiens]], is one of the [[Original Six]] teams of the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and has won an NHL-record 24 [[Stanley Cup]] championships. The Canadiens' most recent Stanley Cup victory came in [[1993 Stanley Cup Finals|1993]]. They have major rivalries with the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[Boston Bruins]], both of which are also Original Six hockey teams, and with the [[Ottawa Senators]], the closest team geographically. The Canadiens have played at the [[Bell Centre]] since 1996. Prior to that they played at the [[Montreal Forum]].
[[File:CentreBell.jpg|thumb|left|Opened in 1996, the [[Bell Centre]] is a sports and entertainment complex, and also serves as the home arena for the [[Montreal Canadiens]].]]
The [[Montreal Alouettes]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) play at [[Molson Stadium]] on the campus of [[McGill University]] for their regular-season games. Late season and playoff games are played at the much larger, enclosed Olympic Stadium, which also played host to the [[2008 Grey Cup]]. The Alouettes have won the Grey Cup seven times, most recently in [[98th Grey Cup|2010]]. The Alouettes has had two periods on hiatus.

Montreal is the site of a high-profile [[auto racing]] event each year: the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] of [[Formula One]] (F1) racing. This race takes place on the famous [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]] on [[Île Notre-Dame]]. In 2009, the race was dropped from the Formula One calendar, to the chagrin of some fans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada dropped from F1 calendar|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/motorsport/formula_one/7657014.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=October 8, 2008|accessdate=July 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Canadian Grand Prix returned to the Formula 1 calendar in 2010. The Circuit Gilles Villeneuve also hosted a round of the [[Champ Car]] World Series from 2002–2007, and was home to the [[NAPA Auto Parts 200]], a [[Xfinity Series|NASCAR Nationwide Series]] race, and the Montréal 200, a [[Grand American Road Racing Association|Grand Am]] [[Rolex Sports Car Series]] race.

==Media==
{{Main|Media in Montreal}}
Montreal is Canada's second-largest media market, and the centre of francophone Canada's media industry.

There are four [[Terrestrial television|over-the-air]] English-language television stations: [[CBMT-DT]] ([[CBC Television]]), [[CFCF-DT]] ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]]), [[CKMI-DT]] ([[Global Television Network|Global]]) and [[CJNT-DT]] ([[City (TV network)|City]]). There are also five over-the-air French-language television stations: [[CBFT-DT]] ([[Télévision de Radio-Canada|Radio-Canada]]), [[CFTM-DT]] ([[TVA (Canada)|TVA]]), [[CFJP-DT]] ([[V (TV network)|V]]), CIVM-DT ([[Télé-Québec]]), and [[CFTU-DT]] (Canal Savoir).

Montreal has three daily newspapers, the English-language ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' and the French-language ''[[Le Journal de Montréal]]'', and ''[[Le Devoir]]''; another French-language daily, ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', became an online daily in 2018. There are two free French dailies, ''[[Metro International|Métro]]'' and ''[[24 Hours (newspaper)|24 Heures]]''. Montreal has numerous weekly tabloids and community newspapers serving various neighbourhoods, ethnic groups and schools.

==Government==
{{Main|Montreal City Council|Mayor of Montreal}}
The head of the [[city government in Montreal]] is the mayor, who is [[first among equals]] in the city council.
[[File:Hotel de ville de Montreal 03.jpg|thumb|left|Completed in 1878, [[Montreal City Hall]] is the [[Montreal City Council|seat of local government]].]]
The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city, although much power is centralized in the executive committee. The Council consists of 65 members from all [[Boroughs of Montreal|boroughs]].&lt;ref name="councillors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ville.montreal.qc.ca/portal/page?_pageid=133,1297433&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=City Council|work=City Hall|publisher=Ville de Montréal|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council has jurisdiction over many matters, including public security, agreements with other governments, subsidy programs, the [[natural environment|environment]], [[urban planning]], and a three-year capital expenditure program. The Council is required to supervise, standardize or approve certain decisions made by the borough councils.

Reporting directly to the council, the executive committee exercises decision-making powers similar to those of the cabinet in a [[parliamentary system]] and is responsible for preparing various documents including [[budget]]s and [[by-law]]s, submitted to the council for approval. The decision-making powers of the executive committee cover, in particular, the awarding of contracts or grants, the management of human and financial resources, supplies and buildings. It may also be assigned further powers by the city council.

Standing committees are the prime instruments for public consultation. They are responsible for the public study of pending matters and for making the appropriate recommendations to the council. They also review the annual budget forecasts for departments under their jurisdiction. A public notice of meeting is published in both French and English daily newspapers at least seven days before each meeting. All meetings include a public question period. The standing committees, of which there are seven, have terms lasting two years. In addition, the City Council may decide to create special committees at any time. Each standing committee is made up of seven to nine members, including a chairman and a vice-chairman. The members are all elected municipal officers, with the exception of a representative of the government of [[Quebec]] on the public security committee.

The city is only one component of the larger [[Greater Montreal|Montreal Metropolitan Community]] (Communauté Métropolitaine de Montréal, CMM), which is in charge of planning, coordinating, and financing economic development, public transportation, garbage collection and [[waste management]], etc., across the metropolitan area. The president of the CMM is the mayor of Montreal. The CMM covers {{convert|4360|km2|sqmi}}, with 3.6&amp;nbsp;million inhabitants in 2006.&lt;ref name="CMM"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cmm.qc.ca/index.php?id=334 |title=The CMM at a Glance |work=Statistics |publisher=[[Greater Montreal Area|Montreal Metropolitan Community]] |accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Montreal is the seat of the [[Judicial districts of Quebec|judicial district]] of Montreal, which includes the city and the other communities on the island.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/D_11/D11_A.HTM ''Territorial Division Act'']. ''Revised Statutes of Quebec'' D-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
The overall crime rate in Montreal has declined, with a few notable exceptions, with murders at the lowest rate since 1972 (23 murders in 2016).&lt;ref name="montreal.ctvnews.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montreal.ctvnews.ca/montreal-s-murder-rate-reaches-45-year-low-see-all-the-crime-stats-1.3481127|title=Montreal's murder rate reaches 45-year low: see all the crime stats|date=June 28, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex crimes have increased 14.5 percent between 2015 and 2016 and fraud cases have increased by 13 percent over the same period.&lt;ref name="montreal.ctvnews.ca"/&gt; The major criminal organizations active in Montreal are the [[Rizzuto crime family]], [[Hells Angels]] and [[West End Gang]].

The ''[[Faculté de théologie évangélique]]'' is [[Nova Scotia]]'s [[Acadia University]] Montreal based serving French Protestant community in Canada by offering both a [[Bachelor's degree|Bachelor]] and a [[Master's degree|Master]] program in theology

The [[Education in Quebec|education system in Quebec]] is different from other systems in North America. Between high school (which ends at grade 11) and university students must go through an additional school called [[CEGEP]]. CEGEPs offer pre-university (2-years) and technical (3-years) programs. In Montreal, [[List of CEGEPs|seventeen CEGEPs]] offer courses in French and five in English.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Montreal}}
[[File:Montreal autoroute.jpg|thumb|Montreal serves as a hub for Quebec's [[Autoroutes of Quebec|autoroute]] system of [[controlled-access highway]]s.]]
Like many major cities, Montreal has a problem with vehicular traffic congestion. Commuting traffic from the cities and towns in the [[West Island]] (such as [[Dollard-des-Ormeaux]] and [[Pointe-Claire]]) is compounded by commuters entering the city that use twenty-four road crossings from numerous off-island suburbs on the [[North Shore (Laval)|North]] and [[South Shore (Montreal)|South Shores]]. The width of the [[Saint Lawrence River]] has made the construction of fixed links to the south shore expensive and difficult. There are presently four road bridges (including two of the country's busiest) along with one bridge-tunnel, two railway bridges, and a [[Montreal Metro|Metro]] line. The far narrower [[Rivière des Prairies]] to the city's north, separating Montreal from Laval, is spanned by nine road bridges (seven to the city of [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]] and two that span directly to the [[North Shore (Laval)|north shore]]) and a Metro line. The island of Montreal is a hub for the Quebec [[Autoroute (Quebec)|Autoroute]] system, and is served by Quebec Autoroutes [[Quebec Autoroute 10|A-10]] (known as the Bonaventure Expressway on the island of Montreal), [[Quebec Autoroute 15|A-15]] (aka the Decarie Expressway south of the A-40 and the Laurentian Autoroute to the north of it), [[Quebec Autoroute 13|A-13]] (aka Chomedey Autoroute), [[Quebec Autoroute 20|A-20]], [[Quebec Autoroute 25|A-25]], [[Quebec Autoroute 40|A-40]] (part of the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] system, and known as "The Metropolitan" or simply "The Met" in its elevated mid-town section), [[Quebec Autoroute 520|A-520]] and [[Quebec Autoroute 720|A-720]] (aka the Ville-Marie Autoroute). Many of these Autoroutes are frequently congested at [[rush hour]].&lt;ref name="epomm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epomm.org/ecomm2004/workshops/anglais/Brun.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lnDvYz4x?url=http://www.epomm.org/ecomm2004/workshops/anglais/Brun.pdf |archivedate=December 5, 2009 |title=The keys to success for Smart Commuting Montreal, the Downtown Montreal Transportation Management Centre |year=2004 |publisher=European Platform on Mobility Management |accessdate=March 26, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, the government has acknowledged this problem and is working on long-term solutions to alleviate the congestion. One such example is the extension of [[Quebec Autoroute 30]] on Montreal's [[South Shore (Montreal)|south shore]], which will serve as a [[bypass (road)|bypass]].&lt;ref name="TransportsQuebec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoroute30.qc.ca/en/a30-objectifs.asp|title=The completion of Autoroute 30|date=August 1, 2008|work=Objectives|publisher=[[Transports Québec]]|accessdate=August 3, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316051744/http://autoroute30.qc.ca/en/a30-objectifs.asp|archivedate=March 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public local transport is served by a network of buses, subways, and commuter trains that extend across and off the island. The subway and bus system are operated by the Société de transport de Montréal (STM). The [[List of Montreal bus routes|STM bus network]] consists of 197 daytime and 20 nighttime routes.

===Rail===
Montreal-based [[Via Rail]] provides rail service to other cities in Canada, particularly to [[Quebec City]] and Toronto along the [[Quebec City – Windsor Corridor]]. [[Amtrak]], the U.S. national passenger rail system, operates its ''[[Adirondack (Amtrak)|Adirondack]]'' daily to New York. All intercity trains and most [[commuter rail|commuter trains]] operate out of [[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]].
[[File:Gare centrale de Montreal - 011.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]] is a major [[inter-city rail|inter-city]] and [[commuter rail]] hub for the city.]]
[[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR), headquartered in [[Calgary]], Alberta, was founded here in 1881.&lt;ref name="CPR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/English/General+Public/Heritage/History/A+Brief+History.htm|title=A Brief History|work=General Public|publisher=[[Canadian Pacific Railway]]|accessdate=September 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its corporate headquarters occupied [[Windsor Station (Montreal)|Windsor Station]] at 910 [[Peel Street, Montreal|Peel Street]] until 1995.&lt;ref name=CE-CP/&gt; With the [[Port of Montreal]] kept open year-round by icebreakers, lines to Eastern Canada became surplus, and now Montreal is the railway's eastern and intermodal freight terminus.&lt;ref name="CP-Map"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/nr/cprinternet/facilitiesmap/index2.htm|title=Where We Ship|work=Customers|publisher=[[Canadian Pacific Railway]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916171451/http://www8.cpr.ca/cms/nr/cprinternet/facilitiesmap/index2.htm|archivedate=September 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPR connects at Montreal with the Port of Montreal, the [[Delaware and Hudson Railway]] to New York, the [[Quebec Gatineau Railway]] to Quebec City and [[Buckingham, Quebec|Buckingham]], the [[Central Maine and Quebec Railway]] to Halifax, and [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] Rail. The CPR's flagship train, ''[[The Canadian]]'', ran daily from Windsor Station to [[Vancouver]], but all passenger services have since been transferred to Via Rail Canada. Since 1990, ''[[The Canadian]]'' has terminated in Toronto.

Montreal-based [[Canadian National Railways]] (CN) was formed in 1919 by the Canadian government following a series of country-wide rail bankruptcies. It was formed from the [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway|Grand Trunk]], Midland and [[Canadian Northern Railway]]s, and has risen to become CPR's chief rival in freight carriage in Canada.&lt;ref name="CN-History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cn.ca/companyinfo/history/en_AboutBirthofCanadianNational19161923.htm|title=Birth of Canadian National 1916–1923|work=Canadian National History|publisher=[[Canadian National Railway]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the CPR, CN has divested itself of passenger services in favour of Via Rail Canada.&lt;ref name="CN-Hist2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cn.ca/companyinfo/history/en_AboutProfitsandpassengers19601979.htm|title=Profits and Passengers – 1960–1979|work=Canadian National History|publisher=[[Canadian National Railway]]|accessdate=August 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; CN's flagship train, the ''[[Super Continental]]'', ran daily from [[Central Station (Montreal)|Central Station]] to [[Vancouver]] and subsequently became a Via train in the late 1970s. It was eliminated in 1990 in favour of rerouting ''[[The Canadian]]''.

The [[commuter rail]] system is managed and operated by the [[Réseau de transport métropolitain]], and reaches the outlying areas of Greater Montreal with six lines. It carried an average of 79,000 daily passengers in 2014, making it the seventh busiest in North America following New York, Chicago, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, and Mexico City.&lt;ref name="EMTA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emta.com/article.php3?id_article=620|title=Montréal Public Transport System|date=February 2008|publisher=European Metropolitan Transport Authorities|accessdate=March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2016 the forthcoming automated [[rapid transit]] system, the [[Réseau express métropolitain]], was unveiled. Groundbreaking occurred 12 April 2018, and construction of the {{Convert|67|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} network - consisting of three branches, 26 stations, and the conversion of the region's busiest commuter railway - commenced the following month. To be opened in three phases as of 2021, the REM will be completed by mid-2023, becoming the fourth largest automated rapid transit network after the [[Dubai Metro]], the [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Singapore Mass Rapid Transit]], and the [[SkyTrain (Vancouver)|Vancouver SkyTrain]]. Most of it will be financed by pension fund manager [[Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/public-transit-update-for-montreals-west-island-south-shore|title=Electric light-rail train network to span Montreal by 2020|date=April 23, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Southwest Asian Neanderthals''' are [[Neanderthals]] that lived in Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, the southernmost expanse of their known range. Although their arrival in Asia is not well-dated, early Neanderthals occupied the region apparently until about 100,000 years ago. At this time, ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' seems to have replaced them in one of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|first anatomically modern expansions out of Africa]]. In their turn, starting around 80,000 years ago, Neanderthals seem to have replaced ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' in Southwest Asia. They inhabited the region until about 55,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="Been2017a"/&gt;

In Southwest Asia, Neanderthals left well-preserved skeletal remains in Israel, Syria, and Iraq. Remains in Turkey, Lebanon, and Iran are fragmentary. No Neanderthal skeletal remain has ever been found to the south of Jerusalem, and although there are [[Middle Palaeolithic]] [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] points in Jordan and in the Arabian peninsula, it is unclear whether these were made by Neanderthals or [[anatomically modern humans]].&lt;ref name="Been2017a"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=E.

&lt;!--==Anatomy==
A large number of scholarly sources claim, without using statistical tests, that Southwest Asian Neanderthals were anatomically different from their European counterparts. But after extensive statistical testing I could not find a single trait that proved significantly different. I refuse to write this section. --[[N.P.|Nicolas Perrault III]]
--&gt;

==Early hominins (to 100 ka)==
{{See also|Out of Africa I}}
As the Levant is the landbridge to Eurasia, Dmanisi remains in Georgia from 1.81 Ma suggest that hominins passed through the Levant some time before this (unless they crossed the [[Bab el-Mandeb]] strait into Arabia). The oldest known hominin specimen from the Levant, and from all the Middle East, is the [[Mugharet el-Zuttiyeh|Zuttiyeh skull]], found by [[Francis Turville-Petre]] near the Sea of Galilee in 1927. It has not been dated, but lithic industries suggest it dates from 250-350 ka (Bar-Yosef 1992).&lt;ref name="Bar-Yosef1992"&gt;Bar-Yosef, O. (1992). The role of western Asia in modern human origins. Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, 337(1280), 193–200.&lt;/ref&gt; Though it has some modern characteristics, it has been classified as a specimen of ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]''.

Other known hominin fossils in Southwest Asia older than 100 ka include [[Shanidar Cave|Shanidar]] 2 and 4, as well as Tabun C1. All three have at one point been classified as Neanderthals, although the latter two are now usually called pre-Neanderthals. In part because none are well-dated these attributions have all been challenged.

== Early AMHs in the Levant (100 to 80 ka) ==
{{See also|Skhul and Qafzeh hominins}}
It is believed that anatomically modern humans first entered the Levant by 130 – 100 ka (Grün 2005)&lt;ref name="Grun2005"&gt;Grün, R., Stringer, C., McDermott, F., Nathan, R., Porat, N., Robertson, S., … McCulloch, M. (2005). U-series and ESR analyses of bones and teeth relating to the human burials from Skhul. Journal of Human Evolution, 49(3), 316–334. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2005.04.006&lt;/ref&gt; from Africa during the Last Interglacial, a hot, parched, period in Africa (Scholz et al. 2007).

===Environment===
Goat [[δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] values from c. 92 ka collected at [[Kedumim Cave|Qafzeh Cave]] show that goats were eating, depending on the season, between 20 and 50% of [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants]]. These plants are better adapted to dry and hot climates than the much more common [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants]]. Although it was already established that North Africa was arid in the early Last Glacial, Scholz et al. (2007)'s conclusions would extend this to the Levant, making the region in this period more arid than previously thought.{{Verify source|date=June 2017|reason=I wrote this in December 2016, wrote down the source in Harvard style, but can't seem to find it. Any help appreciated.}} Frumkin et al. (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Frumkin, A., Bar-Yosef, O., &amp; Schwarcz, H. P. (2011). Possible paleohydrologic effect on hominin migration and occupation of the Levantine Middle Paleolithic. Journal of Human Evolution2, 60(4), 437–451. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2010.03.010&lt;/ref&gt; arrived at a similar conclusion of a hot and arid Levant{{when|date=June 2017}} by examining changes through time of lake levels and in the formation of [[speleothems|cave formations]].

== Return of Neanderthals to the Levant (80 to 55 ka) ==

Potential causes for the initial extinction of modern humans from the Levant and subsequent replacement by Neanderthals around 80 ka include a short-term extreme environmental change in the Levant and environmental changes in the regions neighbouring the Levant. The only long-term environmental change that has been found in the Levant at this period is an increase in rainfall (Hallin et al. 2012),&lt;ref name="Hallin2012"/&gt; and some moderate cooling of the region (Bar-Yosef 1992,&lt;ref name="Bar-Yosef1992"/&gt; Harrison and Bates 1991),&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, D. L., &amp; Bates, P. J. J. (1991). Felidae. In The mammals of Arabia (2nd ed., pp. 156–172). Sevenoaks: Harrison Zoological Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; which would not predict a hominin extinction (Hallin et al. 2012).&lt;ref name="Hallin2012"&gt;Hallin, K. A., Schoeninger, M. J., &amp; Schwarcz, H. P. (2012). Paleoclimate during Neandertal and anatomically modern human occupation at Amud and Qafzeh, Israel: the stable isotope data. Journal of Human Evolution, 62(1), 59–73. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhevol.2011.09.005&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a short-lived intense environmental change (such as a [[volcanic winter]] of 6 to 1000 years caused by the Toba supereruption, Rampino and Self 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Rampino, M. R., &amp; Self, S. (1992). Volcanic Winter and accelerated glaciation following the Toba super-eruption. Nature, 369(6390), 50–52. http://doi.org/10.1038/359050a0&lt;/ref&gt; might have cause modern human extinction, especially if the modern human Levantine population was low (Shea 2008).&lt;ref name = "Shea2008"&gt;Shea, J. J. (2008). Transitions or turnovers ? Climatically-forced extinctions of Homo sapiens and Neanderthals in the East Mediterranean Levant. Quaternary Science Reviews, 1–18. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2008.08.015&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, Neanderthals could have moved in during or after the modern human evacuation of the region.

Alternatively, climate change could have connected the Neanderthal biome to the north, allowing Neanderthals to replace modern humans if Neanderthals were better pre-adapted to the new Levantine environment. It is also possible for climate change to have allowed the North African desert to expand and cut off the modern human Levantine biome from the larger African one. This could have driven to extinction the modern human population with too few individuals to survive when disconnected from Africa, allowing Neanderthals to walk into the region. This could have happened even if modern humans were better adapted to the region than Neanderthals. In other words, in this case, the only advantage Neanderthals would have had in the Levant is that they could actually get there.

=== Environment ===

Contrarily to modern humans who arrived in the Levant in period particularly warm in both Eurasia and Africa, Neanderthals are thought to have entered the Levant in a period of increasing Eurasian coldness and aridity known as the Last Glacial Period (Tchernov 1989).&lt;ref&gt;Tchernov, E. (1989). The Middle Paleolithic mammalian sequence and its bearing on the origin of Homo sapiens in the southern Levant. In O. Bar-Yosef &amp; B. Vandermeersch (Eds.), Investigations in South Levantine Prehistory (pp. 25–42). Oxford: Archaeopress.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Levant, however, the conditions would have been wetter than those of today and of the preceding interglacial. This is what Hallin et al. (2012)&lt;ref name="Hallin2012"/&gt; concluded in their study of the [[δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]&lt;ref group=Note&gt;δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O are so-called [[isotopic signatures]]. They respectively measure the prevalence of the heavier [[carbon-13]] (&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) and [[oxygen-18]] (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) [[isotopes]] over the more common [[carbon-12]] and [[oxygen-16]]. [[C4 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pathway plants]] have relatively more &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C (higher δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C) than [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-pathway plants]]. Because C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants are better adapted to hot and dry climates than C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; plants, high δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C values are associated with hot and dry environments.

To the contrary, a greater prevalence of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O (higher δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) in (land) animal bones reflects a colder environment: Because &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O is lighter than &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, water molecules of the form H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O evaporate slightly more readily than those of the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O form. This difference in evaporation is greater the colder the environment gets, so that rain and snow in colder regions have a lower δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O value. Animals incorporate the δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O information of their environment and it is possible to extract it from their bones and teeth.&lt;/ref&gt; values of goat and gazelle enamel from Amud cave in Neanderthals layers dated to 70-53 ka (Glacial Period), after comparing them to values from Qafzeh cave in a modern human layer dated to 92 ka. They found that at Amud, neither the goats nor the gazelle consumed arid-adapted C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; plants, indicating that the environment was not as dry as today. They found the magnitude and pattern of δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values in gazelle and goat teeth enamel to indicate that, unlike today, rain fell throughout the year at Amud in the Neanderthal period. Indeed, the variation in δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O values in the oldest layers of the teeth, formed when the animal is only a few months old, suggested that goats and gazelles were born throughout the year, which today happens only in the Levant in wetter-than-normal conditions.

Belmaker et al. (2011)&lt;ref name = "Belmaker2011"&gt;Belmaker, M., &amp; Hovers, E. (2011). Ecological change and the extinction of the Levantine Neanderthals: implications from a diachronic study of micromammals from Amud Cave, Israel. Quaternary Science Reviews, 30, 3196–3209. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2011.08.001&lt;/ref&gt; compared the prevalence in caves of microfaunal bones brought back by Barn and Eagle owls, which are known to accumulate large quantities of rodent skeletons. Since owls are opportunistic hunters and will eat any small mammal, the bone assemblage they leave behind are thought to be accurate indicators of the environment, given that rodents, like beetles, are susceptible to small changes in temperature and humidity. The researchers did find changes in microfaunal bone assemblages, but all were expected by taphonomic bias. They therefore concluded that there were no significant changes in the environment of the Levant between 70 and 55 ka.

== Return of AMHs to the Levant (after 55 ka) ==

{{See also|Neanderthal extinction}}
Unless modern humans started expanding into Eurasia through Arabia (where stone tools but very few human bones have been found), the Levant is most likely the first ground Neanderthals have lost in the face of expanding modern humans. The youngest Neanderthal specimen in the Levant is about 45,000 years old. From there on Neanderthals seem to have retreated all the way to the Atlantic over a period of about 2500 to 5000 years. Neanderthals would then have [[Neanderthal extinction|gone extinct]], as there seems to be no evidence of Neanderthals anywhere in their range after 40,000 BP.

It is unclear why Neanderthals abandoned the Levant or lost it to modern humans. Shea (2008)&lt;ref name = "Shea2008"/&gt; has argued that Neanderthals were climatically forced out of the region (as modern humans probably were about 75,000 years ago). This is contested. Belmaker et al. (2011)&lt;ref name="Belmaker2011"/&gt; have found that the proportions of microfaunal bones in the Levant between 70 and 55 ka seem stable, despite the fact that small fauna are sensitive to slight changes in temperature or humidity. There would be hence little reason to believe in a slow deterioration of the Neanderthal habitat driving them out by 45 ka. It is possible that climate change drove Neanderthals to extinction quickly some time after 55,000 BP, but Hallin et al. (2012)&lt;ref name="Hallin2012"/&gt; found strong consistency through time in the [[δ13C|δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]] and [[δ18O|δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]] values in the teeth of both goats and gazelles, suggesting that the climate was stable in the Levant at this crucial period when Middle Palaeolithic technologies of Neanderthals and early modern humans were replaced by Upper Palaeolithic technology of later modern humans.

Although the environment at this period in the Levant seems to have been stable, Shea (2008)&lt;ref name = "Shea2008"/&gt; suggested that a rapidly changing environment at the border between the Levant and the Sinai could have stimulated the development of the first Upper Palaeolithic technologies. In this scenario, modern humans would only have been able to displace Neanderthals once they had developed this technology. The advanced tools found in Europe in the millennia thereafter would have developed there and then.

== Resource gathering strategy ==
It is believed that Neanderthals and modern humans in the Levant had different resource gathering behaviours. Lieberman and Shea (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, D. E., &amp; Shea, J. J. (1994). Behavioral Differences between Archaic and Modern Humans in the Levantine Mousterian. American Anthropologist, 96(2), 300–332. http://doi.org/10.1525/aa.1994.96.2.02a00030&lt;/ref&gt; analysed their lithic hunting technologies and found their differences to suggest Neanderthals hunted more frequently than modern humans. They argue that Neanderthals would have used their intensive hunting strategy to cope with a biodepleted environment, much like the Inuit of the 20th century used to depend largely on hunting. Henry et al. (2017)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D.O. Henry|author2=M. Belmaker|author3=S.M. Bergin|title=The effect of terrain on Neanderthal ecology in the Levant|journal=Quaternary International|volume=435|issue=Part A|year=2017|pages=94–105|doi=10.1016/j.quaint.2015.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in the Levant the site exploitation territory of Neanderthals was narrow, as they limited themselves to rugged woodlands, while modern humans of the Upper Palaeolithic would have been generalists with large exploitation territories in both the rugged woodlands and levelled steppe landscapes.

Although it does seem as if the environment favoured the initial success and eventual demise of Neanderthals, it is still unclear whether differences in their resource gathering strategies reflect differences in the environment, in anatomy, or in intelligence.

'''''Noureddin, Son of Iran''''' ({{lang-fa|نورالدین پسر ایران}}) is the memoirs of [[Sayyid]] Noureddin Afi from the 80 months of his participation in the [[Iran–Iraq war]]. ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' led to Afi's reputation in Iran after it was published by Sureye Mehr Publication in 2011. In 1994, Mousa Ghayour recorded the memoirs of Noureddin Afi in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and it was presented as a written book by Masoume Sepehri years later. َThis book consisted of 18 chapters along with photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibna.ir/vdcauwn6y49nia1.tgk4.html Iran Book News Agency]&lt;/ref&gt; The narrator mentions a dream as the reason of producing this war memoir.&lt;ref name="Mashregh"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mashreghnews.ir/fa/news/117519/%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%BE%D8%B3%D8%B1-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%B7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%AF%DB%8C-%D9%83%D9%87-%D9%81%D9%83%D8%B1-%D9%85%DB%8C%E2%80%8C%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C-%D9%86%D9%83%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA |title= "Noureddin, Son of Iran" The memoir of a man who believed he had done nothing|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= Mashreghnews.com |publisher= |accessdate= 4 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' received an honorable menion in the "Memoir" category of the [[Jalal Al-e Ahmad Literary Awards]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/103523-no-winner-selected-for-irans-most-lucrative-literary-awards-this-year |title=No winner selected for Iran’s most lucrative literary awards this year |work=[[Tehran Times]] |date=25 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210083837/http://www.tehrantimes.com/arts-and-culture/103523-no-winner-selected-for-irans-most-lucrative-literary-awards-this-year |archivedate=10 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
[[Sayyid]] Noureddin wants to participate the Iran–Iraq war, but he is not allowed at first because he is still young. He tries repeatedly and finally they let him go to war. He attends a military training course in the fall of 1980, and heads toward the western zones of Iran to serve in the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Sepah]] of the [[Mehabad]]. He moves to the southern war zones along with his brother, Sadegh. Nourreddin loses his brother in an Iraqi [[airstrike]]. With shrapnel in his body they make him go under surgery in the hospitals of [[Mashhad]] and [[Kermanshah]] many times. But he does not recover well because he is severely damaged in the face, eyes and stomach. Due to the severe injuries on his face, his countenance changes when he is only 18. In 1984, he marries a 16-year-old girl named Masoume and their child is born 4 years later. The war finishes but he is still suffering the injuries and he misses his lovely friends, especially Amir Maralbash who was killed in the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manvaketab.ir/145079-نورالدین-پسر-ایران/bz=fs Book introduction, Nourreddin, Son of Iran (Persian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Why it was written==
In the last page of his memoir, Afi expresses his motivation for recounting his war memories as such:
{{quote|I never thought that, telling the memories is important nowadays. However, war memories and interviews were not discussed and I was involved with the side effects my injuries. In 1994, I dreamed that Mr [[Khamenei]] was reading some papers and crying. I was there, Some one said that these papers were the memories of a %70 [[veteran]] who had participated in war for 80 months and still said he had nothing for the war...My mind was busy with this dream and I felt my duty would finish by telling these memories. So, I  recounted the eight years of living in the war context to make those unique times survive for ever. (P632)&lt;ref name="Mashregh"/&gt;}}

==Animated movie==

''Noureddin, Son of Iran'' is a [[Computer animation|computer animated]] movie directed by Meisam Hosseini. The movie consists of 30 parts of 15 minutes each. Famous Iranian artists such as Atila Pesyani, [[Pejman Bazeghi]], Ali Saleh Ala and Masoud Forutan worked on the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mehrnews.com/detail/News/2136101 |title= "Noureddin, Son of Iran" with the voice of Iranian famous artists/from Saleh Ala and Pesyani to Bazeghi and Forutan|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= mehrnews.com/  Mehr News |publisher= |accessdate= 4 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4312">The '''Oddy test''' is a procedure created at the [[British Museum]] by conservation scientist [[William Andrew Oddy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/objects_conservation/spring_2003/oddy.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123123422/http://www.metmuseum.org/works_of_art/objects_conservation/spring_2003/oddy.asp |archivedate=November 23, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973,&lt;ref&gt;W.A.Oddy, "An unsuspected danger in display", Museum Journal 73, 1973, p.27-28&lt;/ref&gt; in order to test materials for safety in and around art objects.
Often, materials for construction are evaluated for safety. However, though materials may be safe for building purposes, they may emit trace amounts of chemicals that can harm art objects over time. [[Acid]]s, [[formaldehyde]], and other fumes can damage and even destroy delicate artifacts if placed too close.

==Procedure==
This test calls for a sample of the material in question to be placed in an airtight container with three [[Coupon (materials science)|coupons]] of different metals—[[silver]], [[lead]], and [[copper]]—that are not touching each other or the sample of the material.&lt;ref&gt;Schiro,Mara "Oddy Test Protocols" http://www.conservation-wiki.com/index.php?title=Oddy_Test_Protocols&amp;oldid=4830 Accessed February 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The container is sealed with a small amount of de-ionized water to maintain a high [[humidity]], then heated at 60 degrees [[Celsius]] for 28 days. An identical container with three metal coupons acts as a [[Scientific control|control]]. If the metal coupons show no signs of [[corrosion]], then the material is deemed suitable to be placed in and around art objects. The Oddy test is not a contact test, but is for testing [[outgassing|off-gassing]].
[[File:Oddy-test-color.jpg|thumb|A basic layout of a three-in-one Oddy Test]]
Each metal detects a different set of [[corrosive substance|corrosive agents]]. The silver is for detecting reduced sulfur compounds and [[carbonyl sulfide]]s. The lead is for detecting organic acids, [[aldehyde]], and acidic gases. The copper is for detecting [[chloride]], oxide, and sulfur compounds.

There are many types of [[materials testing]] for other purposes, including [[chemical test]]ing and [[physical test]]ing.

==Development==
The Oddy test has gone through many changes and refinements over time. Whereas Andrew Oddy proposed to place each metal coupon in a separate glass container with the material to be tested, Bamberger et al.&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 44, No. 2 (1999), pp. 86-90.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a "three-in-one" test, where all three metal coupons shared one container, simplifying the procedure. Robinett and Thickett (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Studies in Conservation, Vol. 48, No. 4 (2003), pp. 263-268.&lt;/ref&gt; refined the "three-in-one" test by stabilizing the metal coupons.

One of the main issues with the Oddy test is that there is some subjectivity to the interpretation of the results,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-43/standard-materials-for-corrosiveness-testing/&lt;/ref&gt; since it is primarily a visual determination.
[[File:Oddy-tests 0823b.jpg|thumb|Oddy-tests 0823b]]

Institutions that use the Oddy test in their research are mainly art museums such as The [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art|The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]], and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3562">The '''old wood effect''' or '''old wood problem''' is a pitfall encountered in the [[archaeology|archaeological]] technique of [[radiocarbon dating]]. A sample will provide misleading or confusing results if materials of different ages are deposited in the same [[archaeological context|context]]. 

[[Stratification (archeology)|Stratification]] is not always clear-cut in practice. In the case of dating megalithic tombs, indirect evidence for the age of the tomb must always be obtained, because stone (or the time of moving a stone) can not be dated. When a number of objects are recovered from one deposit, the [[terminus post quem]] is based on the dating from the 'youngest' find. Even though other items in the same stratum indicate earlier dates, they may have been deposited at the same time. The deposit must be as young, or younger than the youngest object it contains. Thus excavators look to [[post hole]]s, [[wikt:pit|pits]], or find spots under the [[orthostat]]s for clues to construction dates. The possibility that something (organic) was already in situ must always be considered, especially if the results appear suspiciously early. 

The old wood problem can appear in [[marine archaeology]]. Researchers need to check if stumps from a [[Mesolithic]] or [[Palaeolithic]] [[submerged forest]] are to be found in the area. (If they do, the possibility of one sticking up through, e.&amp;nbsp;g., a shipwreck and giving misleading dates must be considered.)

Organic samples which are not derived from the same part of an organism, may show dating variations which blur and obscure the interpretation being attempted. If compelling archaeological reasons for supposing that the ages come from exactly contemporary samples do not exist, then results must be regarded as suspect.&lt;ref&gt;''Discovering Our Past: A Brief Introduction to Archaeology.'' Second Edition. Mayfield Pub. Co., Mountain View, CA. Ashmore, Wendy and Robert J. Sharer (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; If there exists no prior reason to believe that two samples are truly of the same age, and even if their ages are statistically indistinguishable, they are as likely to be as far apart in true age as the measured difference between them as they are to be of the same age.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, GK and SR Wilson, 1978, Procedures for Comparing and Combining Radiocarbon Age-Determinations – Critique, ''Archaeometry'', 20 (FEB), pp. 19–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charcoal]] was seen historically as an ideal medium for carbon dating. When long-lived tree species, such as [[oak]] and [[juniper]], are used, however, there is a particular danger of encountering the "old wood" problem. For example, the date being measured may be from [[heartwood]], which is already many centuries old by the time the tree was felled. Another difficulty is that of a possible time-lag between felling and final deposition. The timber may have had an extensive history of use and re-use. A method of ameliorating this problem is to date young growth, if available, for example [[hazel]] twigs.
Dating of artefacts using [[Accelerator Mass Spectrometry]] is the gold standard dating method of today; charcoal-sourced dates are seen as unreliable. In establishing the chronology of a site, a representative spread of dates is required before interpretation can be attempted.&lt;ref&gt;Optical and electron microscopy in material culture studies.

'''''Orange Is the New Black: My Year in a Women's Prison''''' (titled '''''Orange Is the New Black: My Time in a Women's Prison''''' in some editions) is a 2010 memoir by [[Piper Kerman]], which tells the story of her [[money laundering]] and [[illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]] conviction and subsequent year spent in a [[Federal Bureau of Prisons|federal]] [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women's prison]].&lt;ref name="nymag1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Humphrey |first=Michael |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/03/piper_kerman.html |title=Ex-Convict Piper Kerman on Her Hot New Memoir, Orange Is the New Black |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]] |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was adapted into the [[Netflix]] original comedy-drama series ''[[Orange Is the New Black]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Prison Life, Real and Onscreen|first=Aimee|last=Lee Ball|date=August 2, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/fashion/prison-life-real-and-onscreen.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The memoir details the events which occur as a result of Piper Kerman's involvement with Nora Jansen, a former friend, lover and drug smuggler.  In 1993, shortly after her graduation from [[Smith College]], Kerman agreed to accompany Jansen on several trips to Asia and Europe, going as far as carrying a suitcase of laundered money across the Atlantic Ocean before returning to San Francisco to "piece her life back together".  In May 1998, Kerman was visited by two Customs agents, and six years later she was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison.  After serving time in three different facilities ([[FCI Danbury]], [[Federal Transfer Center, Oklahoma City|FTC Oklahoma City]], and [[MCC Chicago]]), Kerman was released in March 2005.

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2014}}
Sasha Abramsky of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' stated that the book "documents the author’s attempts to preserve her individuality in the face of a gray, impersonal bureaucracy—one {{sic|based |hide=y|around}} prisoner counts, strip searches, rules governing the minutiae of life, and continual reminders that prisoners, by definition, have no power, no real autonomy."&lt;ref name=Abramskyp3&gt;Abramsky, Sasha. "American Justice." ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'', May–June, 2010, Vol.49(1), p.55(3) [Peer Reviewed Journal]. Online: May 1, 2010. Online [http://www.cjr.org/review/american_justice.php?page=3  p. 3]. ([https://www.webcitation.org/6QvhMKV0l Archive]). Retrieved on July 9, 2014. "The juxtaposition between Texas Tough and Orange Is the New Black is fascinating, and makes them well worth reading together."&lt;/ref&gt; Abramsky wrote that the book is mostly "a journey of self-discovery, describing how one can find one’s true strengths during moments of adversity" and that it "is more similar to South African anti-apartheid activist [[Albie Sachs]]'s ''Jail Diary'' than it is to, say, [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]]’s denunciatory communiqués from Pennsylvania’s death row."&lt;ref name=Abramskyp2&gt;{{cite news|author=Abramsky, Sasha|title=American Justice|work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]]|date= May–June 2010|volume=49|number=1|pages=55(3)|url=http://www.cjr.org/review/american_justice.php?page=2  | accessdate=July 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', Jessica Grose argued that the book is not an examination of women within prison but rather a member of the middle-class-transgression genre, in which women from higher level social classes go into situations which are considered degrading. She said that the book should have included Kerman's insight into her own behavior and "A bit of this moral ambiguity would have helped Kerman's memoir a whole lot."&lt;ref name=Grose&gt;Grose, Jessica. "[http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2010/04/whats_a_nice_blonde_like_me_doing_in_prison.single.html What's a Nice Blonde Like Me Doing in Prison?]" ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. April 8, 2010. Retrieved on April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; June Thomas, also from ''Slate'', cited Grose's review and stated that, "Ultimately, though, the book feels like a well-written, readable stage in Kerman’s rehabilitation."&lt;ref name=ThomasSlate&gt;Thomas, June. "[http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/07/22/orange_is_the_new_black_netflix_tv_show_is_better_than_the_piper_kerman.html How ''Orange Is the New Black'' Improves on the Book]." ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. July 22, 2013. Retrieved on April 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas stated that the television show had improved on the book by expanding on Kerman's descriptions of real people and turning them into compelling fictional characters.&lt;ref name=ThomasSlate/&gt;

Writing in the ''[[Journal-Advocate]]'', Tricia Ketchum called the book "not your typical 'I survived prison memoir', referring to Kerman as "spoiled" as she received multiple care packages and money into her commissary.&lt;ref name=Ketchum&gt;{{cite news| title =Memoir details woman's year in prison | work =Tricia Ketchum | publisher =Journal-Advocate | date =3 May 2016 | url =http://www.journal-advocate.com/entertainment/ci_29597205/memoir-details-womans-year-prison-orange-is-new-black-piper-kerman }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ketchum concludes, "The best part of this book is the message that it leaves you with: No matter what choices you make, you never realize just how much they will impact the lives of those around you until it is too late."&lt;ref name=Ketchum /&gt;

The book was selected by the [[UC Santa Barbara]] Library as its 2015 book for the university-wide reading program "UCSB Reads".&lt;ref name="estrada"&gt;{{cite web|last=Estrada |first=Andrea |url=http://www.news.ucsb.edu/2014/014620/ucsb-reads-selects-orange-new-black-piper-kerman#sthash.f8D878jO.dpuf |title='UCSB Reads’ Selects ‘Orange Is the New Black’ by Piper Kerman |publisher=The UC Santa Barbara Current |date=November 24, 2014 |accessdate=Jan 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">'''Overacting''' (also referred to as '''hamming''' or '''mugging''') refers to acting that is exaggerated. Overacting can be viewed negatively or positively. It is sometimes known as "chewing the [[Theatrical scenery|scenery]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-che2.htm Chew the scenery] ''worldwidewords.org''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Some roles require overly-exaggerated [[character actors|character acting]], particularly those in [[comedy film]]s. For example, the breakthrough roles for [[Jim Carrey]] (in ''[[Ace Ventura: Pet Detective]]'' and ''[[The Mask (film)|The Mask]]'') saw him portray the lead characters in a very flamboyant fashion, as the script demanded. He has played several "straight" roles since.&lt;ref&gt;Gilliver, David. 1998. "[http://gilliver.net/writing/truman.html Film Review: The Truman Show]". Accessed 29 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overacting may be used to portray an outlandish character, or to stress the [[evil]] characteristics of a [[villain]].&lt;ref name="michael"/&gt; [[Academy Award]] winner [[Gary Oldman]] was almost typecast as a criminal early in his film career:&lt;ref&gt;Sexton, Timothy. [https://web.archive.org/web/20120111121252/http://movies.yahoo.com/news/gary-oldman-avoided-typecasting-weirdo-villain-225700644.html How Gary Oldman Avoided Typecasting as a Weirdo, Villain]. ''[[Yahoo! Movies]]''. [[Wayback Machine]]. 6 December 2011. Retrieved 11 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; the necessity to express villainous characters in an overtly physical manner led to the cultivation of his "big" acting style,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Peter Travers|Popcorn With Peter Travers]]''. Season 5. Episode 15. 9 December 2011. "People who know you ... we remember the ''big'' Gary Oldman."&lt;/ref&gt; which hearkened back to his classical theatre training and would become his trademark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Chris|date=August 1999|title=Gary Oldman: A sheep in wolf's clothing|journal=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|issue=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oldman has conceded that his approach involves an element of overacting, saying: "[I]t's my influence on those roles that probably they feel bigger than life and a little over-the-top. I mean, I do go for it a bit as an actor, I must admit."&lt;ref&gt;Gary Oldman interview by [[Terry Gross]]. ''[[Fresh Air]]''. [[NPR|National Public Radio]]. 12 February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oscar and [[Tony Award]]-winning actor [[Al Pacino]], when asked if he overacts, said: "Well, all actors do, in a way. You know what they say: in the theater you have to reach the balcony." Pacino suggested that directors serve to rein in screen performances that are too large.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DGrDN14fRk&amp;t=30s "Extra: Al Pacino, "Scarface" &amp; Overacting"]. [[CBS]]. April 18, 2010. Retrieved February 12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
In an article on overacting, ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' critic Leigh Singer wrote: "Unlike theatre's declamatory projecting to the back row, a 'stagey' performance onscreen isn't a compliment... ultimately, it really is a matter of personal taste."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-overactors-mad-bad-and-dangerous-to-the-scenery-1984789.html&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Labrecque of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' argued that "there's a thin line between overacting (bad) and acting that you're overacting (bizarrely genius)";&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/article/2009/11/11/nicolas-cage-bad-lieutenant/&lt;/ref&gt; the publication at one time gave year-end awards for "best" and "worst" overacting in film, with the aforementioned Oldman and Pacino winning the former for their work in ''[[Léon: The Professional]]'' (1994) and ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'' (1997), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ew.com/article/1994/12/30/our-take-this-years-movies/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ew.com/article/1997/12/26/best-worst-movie-campaigns/&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' journalist Chris Michael, a proponent of overacting, said: "From [[Hugo Weaving]]'s [[Agent Smith]] to [[Heath Ledger]]'s [[Joker (The Dark Knight)|Joker]] to the entire oeuvre of [[William Shatner]], mannered or stylised acting is an underrated skill."&lt;ref name="michael"&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/11/why-i-love-overacting&lt;/ref&gt;

The OTA was founded by Lou Burnard of [[Oxford University Computing Services]] (OUCS) in 1976, initially as the Oxford Archive of Electronic Literature. It is thought to be one of the first archives of digital academic textual resources to collect and distribute materials from other research centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oxford Archive of Electronic Literature|journal=Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing Bulletin|year=1977|volume=5|issue=2|pages=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OTA continued to be hosted by OUCS (which became subsumed into &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.it.ox.ac.uk/ IT Services], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; in 2012), with associated research and development projects ongoing in the [[Oxford e-Research Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oerc.ox.ac.uk/ Oxford e-Research Centre], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Faculty of Linguistics, Philology &amp; Phonetics, University of Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling-phil.ox.ac.uk/ Faculty of Linguistics, Philology and Phonetics], University of Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the OTA found a new home in the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.it.ox.ac.uk/martinw/2016/10/24/oxford-text-archive-moving-to-the-bodleian-library/|title=Oxford Text Archive moving to the Bodleian Library {{!}} Martin Wynne|website=blogs.it.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OTA accepts deposits of primary-source academic electronic editions and linguistic corpora, and is one of the key centres in the emerging European research infrastructure ([[CLARIN]], the Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.eu/ CLARIN], Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;). The OTA hosts many scholarly documents marked up according to the latest (P5) edition of the guidelines of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tei-c.org/Activities/Projects/ox01.xml | title=Oxford Text Archive | publisher=Text Encoding Initiative | work=tei-c.org | accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including copies of all of the [[Eighteenth Century Collections Online]] (ECCO) and  [[Early English Books Online]] (EEBO) texts which are now in the public domain, linked data. The OTA also manages the distribution of the [[British National Corpus]] (BNC).

From 1996 to 2008, the OTA was one of the centres of the [[Arts and Humanities Data Service]], and hosted [[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]], a national centre for the support of digital research in literary and linguistic subject areas in the UK.

The '''Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology''' in [[London]] is part of [[University College London]] Museums and Collections. The museum contains over 80,000 objects and ranks among some of the world's leading collections of Egyptian and Sudanese material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://petriecat.museums.ucl.ac.uk/|title=UCL Petrie Museum Online Catalogue|website=petriecat.museums.ucl.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection and library were arranged in galleries within the university and a guidebook published in 1915. Initially, the collection's visitors were students and academics; it was not then open to the general public. Petrie retired from University College London (UCL) in 1933, though his successors continued to add to the collections, excavating in other parts of Egypt and the Sudan. During the [[Second World War]] (1939–1945) the collection was packed up and moved out of London for safekeeping. In the early 1950s it was moved into a former stable, where it remains adjacent to the science library of UCL.

==Current description==
[[File:On either side of this small and narrow hall, there are displaying cases, containing fragments and slabs of stelae. This is seen immediately after you pass through the information desk.JPG|thumb|left|Fragments and slabs of stelae]]

The museum is at Malet Place, near [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] and the University College London science library. Admission is free, and as of January 2018 the museum is open each afternoon 1pm-5pm, Tuesday to Saturday, with researchers accommodated at other times as well.&lt;ref name="Petrie Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/petrie-museum | title=Petrie Museum | first=|last=Petrie Museum Staff|work=ucl.ac.uk | access-date=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The museum has an education programme for adults and families,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/events/get-hands-ancient-egypt-0|title=Get Hands on with ancient Egypt|last=UCL|website=UCL CULTURE|language=en|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has an active Friends organisation allowing members to attend lectures, museum seminars, tours to Egypt and Egyptian collections, social events, and so on. As well, the Friends raise funds towards the conservation, publication and display of the Petrie Museum's outstanding collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/FriendsofPetrie/pages/Membership.html|title=Friends of the Petrie Museum Membership|author=Petrie Museum Staff|date=28 February 2017|work=Petrie.UCL.ac.uk | accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisation and collections===
[[File:You will see this displaying case when you immediately enter into the Museum; it is next to the information desk. There are many figurines and statuettes.JPG|thumb|Display case at entrance to the Petrie, with figurines and statuettes.]]
The museum is split into three galleries, with the main gallery (housed above the old stables) containing many of the museum's small artifacts, as well as tablets of writing and mummy portraits and cases. Another gallery contains mainly pottery. The third is along a stairwell down to an emergency exit. Some parts of the collection are not lit to protect light-sensitive items, and torches (flashlights) are supplied to see inside the cases.

The collection has been digitised and the catalogue can be browsed and consulted online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petriecat.museums.ucl.ac.uk/search.aspx|title=UCL Petrie Museum Online Catalogue|author=Petrie Museum Staff|date=28 February 2017|work=Petrie.UCL.ac.uk | accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable holdings===
The collection contains some significant 'firsts': one of the earliest pieces of linen from Egypt (about 5000 BC); two lions from the temple of Min at Koptos, from the first group of monumental sculpture (about 3000 BC, these are located in the main UCL building); a fragment from the first kinglist or calendar (about 2900 BC); the earliest example of metal from Egypt, the first worked iron beads; the earliest example of glazing; the earliest 'cylinder seal' in Egypt (about 3500 BC); the oldest wills on papyrus paper; the oldest [[Kahun Gynecological Papyrus|gynaecological papyrus]]; the only veterinary papyrus from ancient Egypt; and the largest architectural drawing, showing a shrine (about 1300 BC).

Costume is another strength of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Hall, Rosalind M. | date = 1986 | title = Egyptian Textiles | page =  | location =  | publisher = Shire Publications | isbn =  | url =  | access-date =  | quote =  }}{{full|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=February 2017}}{{page needed|date=February 2017}} In addition to the 'oldest dress' there is a unique beadnet dress of a dancer from the Pyramid Age (about 2400 BC), two long sleeved robes of the same date, a suit of armour from the palace of Memphis, as well as socks and sandals from the Roman period. The collection contains works of art from Akhenaten’s city at Amarna: colourful tiles, carvings and frescoes, from many other important Egyptian and Nubian settlements and burial sites. The museum houses the world’s largest collection of Roman period mummy portraits (first to second centuries AD).&lt;ref name = IncompletePicton/&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2017}}

The collection also includes material from the Coptic and Islamic periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/petrie/museumtrails |title=Trails and Resources |author=Petrie Museum Staff |date=2 March 2013 |work=Petrie.UCL.ac.uk |accessdate=28 February 2017 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130302074838/http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/petrie/museumtrails |archivedate= 2 March 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a substantial archive held in the museum, including excavation records, correspondence and photographs relating to excavations led by Flinders Petrie. There are additionally documents relating to the distribution of finds from fieldwork to museums worldwide between the 1887 and 1949. &lt;ref&gt;http://egyptartefacts.griffith.ox.ac.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum contains over 80,000 objects and ranks among some of the world's leading collections of Egyptian and Sudanese material.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucl.ac.uk/culture/petrie-museum/about&lt;/ref&gt;  It only ranks behind the collections of the [[Cairo Museum]], [[British Museum|The British Museum]] and the [[Ägyptisches Museum]], Berlin in number and quality of items.{{says who?|date=February 2017}}{{cn|date=February 2017}}

==Published works==
In 2015, the museum, in conjunction with UCL, published a multi-author compilation of articles, ''The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology: Characters and Collections'', which is available in both print and via a free open access download.&lt;ref name=CharactersAndCollections&gt;{{cite book | editor = Stevenson, Alice | date = 2015 | title = The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology: Characters and Collections | location = London, ENG | publisher = UCL Press | url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1468795/4/The_Petrie_Museum_of_Egyptian_Archaeology.pdf | accessdate=28 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is edited by [[Alice Stevenson (archaeologist)|Alice Stevenson]].

The '''Saepta Julia''' was a building in the [[Campus Martius]] of [[Rome]], where citizens gathered to cast votes. The building was conceived by [[Julius Caesar]] and dedicated by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] in 26 BCE. The building replaced an older structure, called the [[Ovile]], built as a place for the ''[[comitia tributa]]'' to gather to cast votes.&lt;ref name="Antony Spawforth 19963"&gt;Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth (eds.), The Oxford Classical Dictionary (1996) — {{ISBN|0-19-866172-X}}  ; available online for a fee&lt;/ref&gt; The Saepta Julia can be seen on the ''[[Forma Urbis Romae]]'', a map of the city of Rome as it existed in the early 3rd century CE. Part of the original wall of the Saepta Julia can still be seen right next to the Pantheon.

== History ==
The conception of the Saepta Julia, which also goes by Saepta or Porticus Saeptorum, began during the reign of Julius Caesar. It took the form of a [[quadriporticus]], an architectural feature made popular by Caesar.&lt;ref name="Antony Spawforth 19963"/&gt;

After Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE, work continued on projects that Caesar had set into motion.&lt;ref&gt;Cic. Att 4.16.14&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], who had supported Caesar before his death, and subsequently aligned with his successor [[Octavian]], took on the continuation of the Saepta Julia building project. The building was finally completed and dedicated by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]] in 26 BCE. Agrippa also decorated the building with marble tablets and Greek paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Campus Martius: The Field of Mars in the Life of Ancient Rome|last1=Jacobs II|first1=Paul W.|last2=Conlin|first2=Diane Atnally|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Fire of Rome]] led to its destruction in 80 CE, and was rebuilt sometime before the reign of Domitian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silvae 4.5.2|last=Statius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration also took place under Hadrian, as is evidenced by brick-work and literary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historia Augusta: Life of Hadrian|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building is also attested on a post-[[Constantine the Great|Constantine]] bronze collar of a slave, but there is no known mention of the building in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|last=Platner|first=Samuel|last2=Ashby|first2=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1929|isbn=|location=London|pages=460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saepta Julia can be seen on the ''[[Forma Urbis Romae]]'', a map of the city of Rome as it existed in the early 3rd century CE. Part of the original wall of the Saepta Julia can still be seen right next to the Pantheon

== Plan ==
Due to the limited archaeological remains, the majority of archaeological reconstructions are derived from the [[Forma Urbis Romae]] and corresponding literary sources. Located on the Campus Martius, between the [[Baths of Agrippa]] and the [[Serapeum]], the Saepta Julia was a rectangular porticus complex, which extended along the west side of the [[Via lata|Via Lata]] to the Via di S. Marco. It was 310 meters long by 120 meters wide and was built of travertine marble. Two porticoes lay on the east and west of the complex. The north end was a lobby, and the south side connected to the [[Diribitorium]] through an uncolonnaded, broad corridor. The only entrances that have been discerned are minor entrances on the south end of the complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|last=Richardson Jr.|first=Lawrence|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological excavations underneath the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery|Palazzo Doria]] uncovered multiple travertine piers. While the majority of the piers measured 1.7 meters square, other piers showed a variety of dimensions. This has led some scholars to speculate on the existence of a second floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|last=Platner|first=Samuel|last2=Ashby|first2=Thomas|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1929|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|last=Richardson Jr.|first=Lawrence|publisher=Johns Hopkins University|year=1992|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Saepta was supplied with water by [[Aqua Virgo]], which supplied the majority of buildings on the Campus Martius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Water Distribution in Ancient Rome: The Evidence of Frontinus|last=Harry|first=Evans|publisher=University of Michigan Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Ann Arbor|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porticus Argonautarum ===
[[File:The_Pantheon_(III)_(4924153315).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Pantheon_(III)_(4924153315).jpg|thumb|Western wall of the Porticus Argonautarum]]
The [[Porticus Argonautarum]] lined the western side of the Saepta Julia. It was completed by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] ca. 25 BCE, and received its name from the artwork it depicted, which showed [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. A portion of the western wall survives, and is located beside the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], and suggests that it was made of brick-faced concrete, and covered in marble.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A New Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome|last=Richardson Jr.|first=Lawrence|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Baltimore|pages=312–340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstructed by Domitian after the fire of 80 CE, this portico was also part of Hadrian's reconstruction of the entire Saepta Julia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hadrian and the City of Rome|last1=Boatwright|first1=Mary|date=1987|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Porticus Meleagri ===
The Porticus Meleagri lined the eastern side of the Saepta Julia. Little remains of the Porticus Meleagri, and location and reconstruction rely primarily on the [[Forma Urbis Romae]]. Although not mentioned, it was most likely constructed during the final decades of the first century BCE, along with the dedication of the Saepta.

== Use ==
The concept of the Saepta was initially planned by Caesar in place of the earlier [[Ovile]], and was projected as early as 54 BCE, and finished by Agrippa in 26 BCE. In a letter to Atticus, Cicero writes that the building was to be made of marble, with a lofty portico and a roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letters to Atticus 2|last=Cicero|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building was initially intended to be used as a voting place for both the [[comitia centuriata]] and the [[Comitia Tributa|comitia tributa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ruins and Excavations of Ancient Rome: A Companion for Students and Travelers|last=Lanciani|first=Rodolfo|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company|year=1897|isbn=|location=New York|pages=472}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the diminishing importance of the voting comitias from the Augustan period onward, the building began to be repurposed. Gladiatorial combats were exhibited during the period of Augustus, and the building was also used by the senate as a meeting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of Augustus 23|last=Suetonius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Tiberius returned from Germany, after his military procession, he was presented in this building by Augustus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of Tiberius 17|last=Suetonius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Augustus and Caligula used this building for [[naumachia]]e.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of Caligula 18|last=Suetonius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for gymnastics competitions and exhibitions during the reign of Nero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Life of Nero 12|last=Suetonius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statius and Martial report that it was used intermittently as a public space for Roman citizens, as well as a market for luxury goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Silvae 4.2.6|last=Statius|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epigrams 2.14.5|last=Martial|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sardonicism''' is "the quality or state of being sardonic; an instance of this; a sardonic remark."&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'': "sardonicism".&lt;/ref&gt; A ''sardonic'' action is one that is "disdainfully or skeptically humorous" or "derisively mocking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sardonic|title=Definition of SARDONIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when referring to laughter or a smile, it is "bitter, scornful, mocking". Hence, when referring to a person or a personal attribute, it is "[c]haracterized by or exhibiting bitterness, scorn or mockery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sardonic|title=Definition of sardonic in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Both the origin of the concept and the etymology of the word sardonicism is uncertain, but it appears to stem from the name for the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] island of [[Sardinia]]. The 10th-century [[Byzantine|Byzantine Greek]] encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]'' traces the word's earliest roots to the notion of grinning ({{lang-grc|σαίρω| sairō}}) in the face of danger, or curling one's lips back at evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?login=guest&amp;enlogin=guest&amp;db=REAL&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;searchstr=sigma,124|title=SOL Search|website=www.stoa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One explanation for the later alteration to its more familiar form and connection to laughter (supported by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'') appears to stem from an ancient belief that ingesting the [[Water dropwort#Sardonic grin|''sardonion'']] (σαρδόνιον) plant from [[Sardinia]] (Σαρδώ) would result in convulsions resembling laughter and, ultimately, death.&lt;ref name="reference1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sardonic |title=Sardonic &amp;#124; Define Sardonic at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Theory and History of Folklore'', [[Vladimir Propp]] discusses alleged examples of ritual laughter accompanying death and killing, all involving groups. These he characterized as sardonic laughter:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Among the very ancient [[Sardinians|people of Sardinia]], who were called Sardi or Sardoni, it was customary to kill old people. While killing their old people, the Sardi laughed loudly. This is the origin of notorious sardonic laughter (Eugen Fehrle, 1930). In light of our findings things begin to look different. Laughter accompanies the passage from death to life; it creates life and accompanies birth. Consequently, laughter accompanying killing transforms death into a new birth, nullifies murder as such, and is an act of piety that transforms death into a new life.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''[https://monoskop.org/images/f/f0/Propp_Vladimir_Theory_and_History_of_Folklore.pdf Theory and History of Folklore]'': Ritual laughter in folklore, pp. 134-35. Anthology edited by [[Anatoly Liberman]] (1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A root form may first appear in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' as the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sardánios'', for scornful laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/sardonic?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Sardonic definition and meaning - Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the {{Lang|el-Latn|sardónios}} evolved the {{lang-la|sardonius}}, thence the {{lang-fr|sardonique}}, and ultimately the familiar English adjectival form, ''sardonic''.&lt;ref name="reference1"/&gt;

== ''Risus sardonicus'' ==
{{Main|Risus sardonicus}}
''[[Risus sardonicus]]'' is an apparent smile on the face of those who are convulsing because of [[tetanus]], or [[strychnine]] poisoning. From the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', "A fixed, grin-like expression resulting from spasm of facial muscles, esp. in tetanus." Also:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Convulsion of the] facial muscles may cause a characteristic expression called ''Risus sardonicus'' (from the Latin for scornful laughter) or ''Risus caninus'' (from the Latin for doglike laughter or grinning). This facial expression has also been observed among patients with tetanus. ''Risus sardonicus'' causes a patient's eyebrows to rise, eyes to bulge, and mouth to retract dramatically, resulting in what has been described as an evil-looking grin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AgfjGTxPM2MC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Strychnine+risus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wB7IU7SHMtKf7Abj9ICoAw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Strychnine%20risus&amp;f=false Holstege, C. et al., ''Criminal Poisoning: Clinical and Forensic Perspectives'', by Christopher Holstege, Thomas Neer, Gregory Saathoff, and Brent Furbee, Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2010, p. 161.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hemlock water dropwort ===

In 2009 scientists at the [[University of Eastern Piedmont]] in [[Italy]] claimed to have identified hemlock [[water dropwort]] (''Oenanthe crocata'') as the plant responsible for producing the sardonic grin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Journal of Natural Products|year = 2009|volume = 72|issue = 5|pages = 962–965|title = Polyacetylenes from Sardinian ''Oenanthe fistulosa'': A Molecular Clue to ''risus sardonicus''|author1=G.

When these people were unable to support themselves, they were [[Substance intoxication|intoxicated]] with this herb and then dropped from a high rock or beaten to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-aug-09 News Scan Briefs: Killer Smile], Scientific American, August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Star polygon]]s and polygonal compounds are the basis for numerous figures of significance in [[arts]] and [[culture]]. The figure may be the border or interior of the polygon, or one or more closed polygonal paths that include all of the border and also have some legs crossing the interior. Impressions of [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[stars]] provide the term, but specific uses may exploit the connection or not. Stars often represent the unity of states within a country when they are used as a part of the flag.

==Five-pointed stars==
{{Main|Five-pointed star}}
[[File:Five-pointed star.svg|thumb|100px|Five-pointed star]]
The five-pointed star, if drawn with points of equal length and angles of 36° at each point, is sometimes termed a '''golden five pointed star'''.&lt;ref name="symbDict5-point"&gt;[http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2824.html The five-pointed star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111121634/http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2824.html |date=11 November 2006 }} from {{cite book |last=Liungman |first=Carl G. |year=2004 |title=Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms |publisher=HME Publishing |isbn=91-972705-0-4}}. Retrieved 19 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; If the colinear edges are joined together, a [[pentagram]] is produced, which is the simplest of the [[unicursal hexagram|unicursal]] [[star polygon]]s, and a symbol of [[mysticism|mystical]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] significance.
Originally, the five-pointed star (pentangle), forming a pentagram within it, represented the ten tribes of Israel that broke away from the ruling class of Judah, Benjamin, and the Priests.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} There are ten "Vav" or "man" that form the five points. A circle was also added around the Israelite Star because it was the letter "Samek" meaning, "death". Today's modern Pagans tend to use all three symbols, rather than making any distinction.
The golden five-pointed star is a very common [[ideogram]] in the western world, and has particularly strong associations with military power and war. The Asian giant [[LG Corporation]]'s initials actually stand for "Lucky Goldstar" (and not "Life is Good" as many Westerners are led to believe). Many [[communism|communist]] countries (such as [[People's Republic of China|China]] and [[Vietnam]]) and symbols (the [[hammer and sickle]]) also incorporate [[Red star|five-pointed stars]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The five-pointed star appears in the flags of 35 countries, and also appears commonly in the [[heraldry]] of the [[United States]], and stands in contrast to the [[Vexillology|vexillologically]] rarer [[heptagram|seven-pointed star]].

The five-pointed star occurs in conjunction with a [[crescent]] in the flags of several countries to symbolize [[Islam]], appearing for example as part of the symbol of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

In [[philately]], the five-pointed star signifies stamps that have not been [[postmark]]ed.

The five-pointed star is used as the symbol of the [[People Nation]] alliance of gangs from Chicago.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  [[Bloods (gang)|Blood]] gangs who originated from New York, known as the United Blood Nation, also use this as a symbol as they have emulated the People Nation alliance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In the Armenian Pantheon, there is a goddess called Astlik/Astghik. In the Armenian language Astgh means star, Astghik - Little Star. Compared with Ishtar, Astara, this goddess' sign should have been the (probably)eight-pointed star.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Six-pointed stars==
Several varieties of six-pointed stars are used in Western culture:
* If the [[Collinearity|collinear edges]] of a regular six-pointed star are connected, so that two interlaced triangles are formed, a symbol results that is variously known as the [[hexagram]], [[Star of David]], or Shield of David (Magen David). This symbol is most commonly associated with [[Judaism]]. It is also used in [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]], but on a less frequent basis.
*The [[Ahmadiyya]] flag, ''Lawa-e-Ahmaddiyat'', contains a six-pointed star, adjacent to a crescent. 
* The [[Star of Life]], which is a six-armed cross.
* The [[Great Seal of the United States]] contains a six-pointed star made up of 13 stars (representing the original 13 colonies).
* The municipal [[flag of Chicago]] has four six-pointed stars.
* German and German-American [[hex sign]]s and [[Barnstars|barn stars]] often incorporate both five- and six-pointed stars as central themes.
* The six-pointed star is used as the symbol for the [[Folk Nation]] alliance of gangs from Chicago. Crip gang members tend to use this symbol also.

Apart from the foresaid mentions, six-pointed star formations are rare as an [[ideograph]] in Western cultures except in the case of law enforcement badges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2826.html The sixpointed star] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061111124629/http://www.symbols.com/encyclopedia/28/2826.html |date=11 November 2006 }} from {{cite book |last=Liungman |first=Carl G. |year=2004 |title=Symbols: Encyclopedia of Western Signs and Ideograms |publisher=HME Publishing |isbn=91-972705-0-4}}. Retrieved 19 July 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[astrology]], some formations of a six-pointed star can signify [[fixed star]]s. In some rare instances, it can signify the date of birth on a gravestone, synonymous with the five-point star.

==Seven-pointed stars==
===Political===
A seven-pointed star appears in the [[flag]] and [[heraldry|heraldic]] symbolism of [[Australia]]. In the Australian context, the seven points (also known as the '''Commonwealth Star''', the  '''Federation Star''', the '''Seven Point Star''', or the '''Star of Federation''') is a seven-pointed star symbolising the [[Federation of Australia]] which came into force on 1 January 1901. Six points of the Star represent the six [[States and territories of Australia|original states]] of the [[Australia|Commonwealth of Australia]], while the seventh point represents the territories.

The seven-pointed stars stand in contrast to the [[vexillology|vexillologically]] more conventional [[five-pointed star]]s.

The Seal of the [[Cherokee Nation]] has an acute gold seven-pointed star in its seal.

The seven-pointed star is also used as a symbol of the [[Trinitarios]] gang from New York City.

A [[heptagram]] or '''septagram''' is a seven-pointed star drawn with seven straight strokes. There are two kinds of heptagrams:
* ''Acute heptagram'', the {7/3} [[star polygon]].
* ''Obtuse heptagram'', the {7/2} star polygon.

The '''Survey of Professional Forecasters''' ('''SPF''') is a quarterly survey of macroeconomic forecasts for the [[economy of the United States]] issued by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]. It is the oldest such survey in the United States.

The survey includes an "anxious index" that estimates the probability of a decline in real GDP.&lt;ref name=anxious&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/anxious-index/|title = The Anxious Index|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The survey began in 1968 and was conducted by the [[American Statistical Association]] (ASA) and the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER). The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia took over the survey in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/|title = Survey of Professional Forecasters|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/publications/business-review/1993/brnd93dc.pdf|title = Introducing: The Survey of Professional Forecasters|last = Croushure|first = Dean|date = November–December 1993|publisher = ''[[Business Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its early days (prior to the takeover by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia) the survey was often referred to in the academic literature as the ASA-NBER survey.&lt;ref name=academic-bibliography/&gt;

In May 2008, it was announced that SPF would be adding an industry classification variable for its survey respondents, so that researchers could more easily determine how people's forecasts related to the industry they were from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phil.frb.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/spf-industry-variable.pdf|title = Introducing: An Industry Classification for the Survey of Professional Forecasters|last = Chew|first = John|last2 = Price|first2 = Calvin|date = May 2008|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variables==

The Survey of Professional Forecasters includes variables in the following broad categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/data-files/|title = Historical Data Files for the Survey of Professional Forecasters|date = August 10, 2012|accessdate = April 13, 2014|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

SPF has been used in academic research on forecast accuracy and forecast bias.&lt;ref name=academic-bibliography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/academic-bibliography.cfm|title = Academic Bibliography|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmacentre.ac.uk/pdf/seminar/clements2.pdf|title = An evaluation of the Survey of Professional Forecasters probability distributions of expected inflation and output growth.|last = Clements|first = Michael|date = November 22, 2002|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Differential Interpretation in the Survey of Professional Forecasters|last = Manzan|first = Sebastiano|date = August 2011|doi = 10.1111/j.1538-4616.2011.00404.x|journal = [[Journal of Money, Credit and Banking]]|volume = 43|issue = 5|pages = 993–1017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 analysis of density forecasts of inflation made in the SPF finds: "The probability of a large negative inflation shock is generally overestimated, and in more recent years the probability of a large shock of either sign is overestimated. Inflation surprises are serially correlated, although agents eventually adapt. Expectations of low inflation are associated with reduced uncertainty. The results suggest several promising directions for future research."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |title = Evaluating Density Forecasts of Inflation: The Survey of Professional Forecasters |first=Francis X. |last=Diebold |first2=Anthony S. |last2=Tay |first3=Kenneth F. |last3=Wallis |work=NBER Working Paper No. 6228 |date=October 1997 |doi=10.3386/w6228 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SPF keeps a record of the bias and error in its own past forecasts online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-data/real-time-center/survey-of-professional-forecasters/data-files/error-statistics.cfm|title = Forecast Error Statistics for the Survey of Professional Forecasters|publisher = [[Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia]]|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their forecasting track record and the implications of their forecasts have been discussed on business press and blogs, including ''[[Forbes]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2013/09/02/economic-assumptions-for-your-2014-business-plan/|title = Economic Assumptions For Your 2014 Business Plan|last = Conerly|first = Bill|date = September 2, 2013|accessdate = April 21, 2014|publisher = ''[[Forbes]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/08/13/economists-in-philly-fed-survey-more-pessimistic/|title = Economists in Philly Fed Survey More Pessimistic|last = Derby|first = Michael|date = August 13, 2010|accessdate = April 13, 2014|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://businessforecastblog.com/the-accuracy-of-macroeconomics-forecasts-survey-of-professional-forecasters/|title = The Accuracy of Macroeconomics Forecasts – Survey of Professional Forecasters|last = Jones|first = Clive|publisher = Business Forecasting|date = February 25, 2014|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economicgreenfield.com/2013/11/26/philadelphia-fed-4th-quarter-2013-survey-of-professional-forecasters/|title = Philadelphia Fed – 4th Quarter 2013 Survey Of Professional Forecasters|publisher = EconomicGreenfield|last = Kavadas|first = Ted|date = November 26, 2013|accessdate = April 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of Tennessee}}
{{Confederate states in the American Civil War}}

To a large extent, the [[American Civil War]] was fought in cities and farms of [[Tennessee]], as only Virginia saw more battles. However, Tennessee is the only state to have major battles or skirmishes fought in every single county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tn4me.org/article.cfm/era_id/5/major_id/5/minor_id/4/a_id/25|title=Tennessee 4 Me -|author=|date=|website=www.tn4me.org|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sos.tn.gov/products/tsla/tennessee-civil-war-gis-interactive-map|title=Tennessee Civil War GIS Interactive Map - Tennessee Secretary of State|author=|date=|website=sos.tn.gov|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee was the last of the [[Southern United States|Southern states]] to declare [[secession]] from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] as a substantial portion of the population were against secession, but saw more than its share of the devastation resulting from years of warring armies criss-crossing the state. Its rivers were key arteries to the [[Deep South]], and, from the early days of the war, Union efforts focused on securing control of those transportation routes, as well as major roads and mountain passes such as the [[Cumberland Gap]]. Tennessee was also considered "the Bread Basket" of the Confederacy, for its rich farmland that fed both armies during the war.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesnews.net/Our-History/2018/05/03/div-class-libPageBodyLinebreak-Want-to-learn-about-the-rebuilding-Tennessee-after-the-Civil-War-div.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of important battles occurred in Tennessee, including the vicious fighting at the [[Battle of Shiloh]], which at the time was the deadliest battle in American history (it was later surpassed by a number of other engagements). Other large battles in Tennessee included [[Battle of Stones River|Stones River]], [[Third Battle of Chattanooga|Chattanooga]], [[Battle of Nashville|Nashville]], and [[Battle of Franklin|Franklin]].

Tennessee was one of the most divided states in the country at the outset of the war. Before the bombardment of [[Fort Sumter]], Tennessee was staunchly pro-Union, though there were still a few secessionist hot beds in the western and middle portion of the state. The situation rapidly changed when Fort Sumter was bombarded and [[President Lincoln's 75,000 volunteers|Lincoln made the call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion]]. Tennesseans saw this as a threat to their "southern brethren," and though Tennessee voted to secede, there were still areas scattered all over state that had strong Union sympathies. The areas Unionism was most prominent were in the hills overlooking the west bank of the Tennessee River in the western part of the state, and in the rough mountains to the east.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teachtnhistory.org/index.cfm/m/118/Additional_Resources&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Tennessee would furnish more troops for the Union than every other Confederate state, combined.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civilwardata.com/dbstatus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Pro-Union and anti-Republican sentiment before the attack on Fort Sumter===
[[File:JBell.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] (1796–1869), 1860 [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] presidential candidate]]
Initially, most Tennesseans showed little enthusiasm for breaking away from a nation whose struggles it had shared for so long. In 1860, they had voted by a slim margin for the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Unionist]] [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]], a native son and moderate who continued to search for a way out of the crisis.

A vocal minority of Tennesseans spoke critically of the Northern states and the Lincoln presidency. "The people of the South are preparing for their next highest duty– resistance to coercion or invasion," wrote the Nashville ''Daily Gazette'' on January 5, 1861. The newspaper expressed the view that Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were exercising the highest right of all by taking control of all [[fort]]s and other military establishments within the area– the right to self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Nashville ''Daily Gazette''|title=The Effect |date= 5 January 1861| url=http://tn.gov/tsla/cwsb/1861-01-Article-1-Page2.pdf |format=PDF|accessdate=February 17, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A pro-secessionist proposal was made in the Memphis ''Appeal'' to build a fort at [[Randolph, Tennessee]], on the [[Mississippi River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pro-secessionist proposal to construct a fort at Randolph, Tennessee, on the Mississippi River |url=http://tn.gov/tsla/cwsb/1861-01-Article-6-Page9.pdf | publisher= Memphis ''Appeal'' | date= 20 January 1861 |format=PDF|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[Isham G. Harris]] convened an emergency session of the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] in January 1861.  During his speech before the legislative body on January 7, he described the secession of the Southern states as a crisis caused by "long continued agitation of the slavery question" and "actual and threatened aggressions of the Northern States&amp;nbsp;... upon the well-defined constitutions rights of the Southern citizen." He also expressed alarm at the growth of the "purely sectional" Republican Party, which he stated was bound together by the "uncompromising hostility to the rights and institutions of the fifteen Southern states." He identified numerous grievances with the Republican Party, blaming them for inducing slaves to run off by means of the [[Underground Railroad]], [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raids, and high taxes on slave labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Messages of the Governors of Tennessee, 1859-1869, Vol. 5, pp.255-269; Excerpts from Governor Isham G. Harris' Legislative Message |last1= White |first1= Robert D.|url=http://tn.gov/tsla/cwsb/1861-01-Article-2-Page3.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate= 17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris agreed with the idea of popular sovereignty, that only the people within a state can determine whether or not slavery could exist within the boundaries of that state. Furthermore, he regarded laws passed by Congress that made U.S. territories non-slave states as taking territories away from the American people and making them solely for the North, territories from which "Southern men unable to live under a government which may by law recognize the free negro as his equal" were excluded. Governor Harris proposed holding a State Convention. A series of resolutions were presented in the [[Tennessee House of Representatives]] by [[William H. Wisener]] against the proposal.  He declared passing any law reorganizing and arming the state militia to be inexpedient.

The centrality of the question of slavery to the secession movement was not doubted by people at the time of the Civil War, nor was it ignored by the contemporary press. Especially in the case of the pro-slavery papers, this question of the possibility of the eventual granting of equal rights for people of color was not couched in diplomatic phraseology: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The election, be it remembered, takes place on the 9th, and the Delegates meet in Convention on the 25th instant. If you desire to wait until you are tied hand and foot then vote for the men who advocate the 'watch and wait' policy. ''If you think you have rights and are the superiors of the black man'' then vote for the men who will not sell you out, body and soul to the Yankee Republicans - for men who would rather see Tennessee independent out of the Union, then in the Union subjugated. [emphasis in original]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tn.gov/tsla/cwsb/1861-02-Article-1-Page2.pdf |title= The Tennessee Convention. |date= 2 February 1861|publisher= Nashville ''Daily Gazette''|accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

On February 3, 1861, the pro-Union Knoxville ''Whig'' published a "Secret Circular" that had mistakenly been sent by its authors to a pro-Union Tennessee U.S. Postmaster.  In it was revealed a comprehensive plan by pro-slavery Tennesseeans and others to launch a propaganda campaign to convince Tennesseans that the strength of the pro-secessionist movement was overwhelming:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Dear Sir — Our earnest solicitude for the success of the Great Southern Rights movement to secure an immediate release from the overwhelming dangers that imperil our political and social safety, will we trust, be a sufficient apology for the results which we beg to impose on you.  The sentiment of the Southern heart is overwhelming in favor of the movement. Light only is wanted that men many see their way clearly and the prayer of every true patriot will eventually be realized. Tennessee will be a unit. Although the time be so very short, this object may yet be accomplished, if a few men only, (the more the better, however) in each county, will devote their entire energies to it during the canvass for Delegates. We earnestly beg your attention, therefore, to the following suggestions:

#Be sure to have your best men in the field, WITHOUT REGARD TO PAST POLITICAL OPINIONS.
#Be sure that no submissionist, under whatever pretext of compromising our rights, or of waiting beyond the 4th of March for new guarantees, impose himself on you. Our only hope of peace and safety consists in decided action before the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln.
#Do not wait for general meetings of citizens, but get together immediately a few active, intelligent, discreet but thoroughgoing, uncompromising, true-hearted, "Southern-Rights Anti-Coercion" friends and appoint Committees and Canvassers, who are willing to devote themselves entirely and unceasingly to the great and perilous work, from this hour up to the close of the election.
#Appoint Committees, also, for each Civil District, of men known to coincide with you and ourselves in sentiment.
#Organize, forthwith, Southern Rights Anti-Coercion Societies.
#We will send during the canvass, the UNION AND AMERICAN and GAZETTE, to supply your County. These we confidently trust you will send immediately to the District Committees, who on the hour of delivery, start out on the work of distribution, and this though there be but half a dozen copies for each district. Do not, we beg of you, wait for persons to call for documents, of papers to read and CIRCULATE.
#Write as many letters to your friends [as] possible, and urge them by every consideration of patriotism, to work, work, work.

[...] We can, we must, carry our State. Our hearts would link within us, at the bare thought of the degradations and infamy of abandoning our more Southern brethren united to us by all the views so sympathy and interest, and of being chained to the car of Black Republican States, who would themselves despise us for our submission; and worse than all, by moral influences alone, if not by force of legal enactment destroy our entire social fabric, and all real independence of thought and action.
'''''Your own good judgment will suggest many things we can not now allude to.''''' [emphasis added]
&lt;br&gt;Very Respectfully,
&lt;br&gt;[Signed]Wm. Williams, Chm'n./S. C. Goethall [?], Sec'y,/Andrew Cheatham/J. R. Baus [?]/R. H. Williamson/G. W. Cunningham/H. M. Cheatham, W. S. Peppin

In Memphis, Unionists held two torchlight processions to honor their cause.

In February 1861, 54 percent of the state's voters voted against sending delegates to a secession convention, defeating the proposal for a State Convention by a vote of 69,675 to 57,798. If a State Convention had been held, it would have been very heavily pro-Union. 88,803 votes were cast for Unionist candidates and 22,749 votes were cast for Secession candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tn.gov/tsla/cwsb/1861-02-Article-10-Page19.pdf |title=Messages of the Governors of Tennessee, op cit. p.272: The vote against secession, and against 'Convention' or 'No Convention' |last1=White |first1= Robert D. |accessdate=17 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day the American flag was displayed in "every section of the city," with zeal equal to that which existed during the late 1860 presidential campaign, wrote the Nashville ''Daily Gazette''.

And if the remonstrances of the people of the South-pleading and begging for redress for years-does not in this critical moment, arouse her brethren of the North to a sense of justice and right, and honor demands a separation, we would still have the same claims upon the 'colors of Washington, great son of the South, and of Virginia, mother of the States.'

On March 7, the Memphis ''Daily Appeal'' wrote that the abolitionists were attempting to deprive the South of territories won during the [[U.S.-Mexican War]].

===Reaction to the attack on Fort Sumter===
With the attack on [[Fort Sumter]] on April 12, 1861, followed by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s April 15 call for 75,000 volunteers to put the seceded states back into line, public sentiment turned dramatically against the Union.

Historian Daniel Crofts thus reports:
:''Unionists of all descriptions, both those who became Confederates and those who did not, considered the proclamation calling for seventy-five thousand troops "disastrous." Having consulted personally with Lincoln in March, Congressman [[Horace Maynard]], the unconditional Unionist and future Republican from East Tennessee, felt assured that the administration would pursue a peaceful policy. Soon after April 15, a dismayed Maynard reported that "the President's extraordinary proclamation" had unleashed "a tornado of excitement that seems likely to sweep us all away." Men who had "heretofore been cool, firm and Union loving" had become "perfectly wild" and were "aroused to a frenzy of passion." For what purpose, they asked, could such an army be wanted "but to invade, overrun and subjugate the Southern states." The growing war spirit in the North further convinced southerners that they would have to "fight for our hearthstones and the security of home."''&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Crofts, ''Reluctant Confederates: Upper South Unionists in the Secession Crisis'' (1989), p.334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor [[Isham Harris]] began military mobilization, submitted an [[law|ordinance]] of [[secession]] to the [[Tennessee General Assembly|General Assembly]], and made direct overtures to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] government.

===Tennessee secedes===
In the June 8, 1861 referendum, [[East Tennessee]] held firm against separation, while [[West Tennessee]] returned an equally heavy majority in favor.  The deciding vote came in [[Middle Tennessee]], which went from 51 percent against secession in February to 88 percent in favor in June.

Having ratified by popular vote its connection with the fledgling [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], Tennessee became the last state to declare formally its withdrawal from the Union.

==Major campaigns==

===1862===
Control of the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Tennessee River]]s was important in gaining control of Tennessee during the age of [[steamboat]]s. Tennessee relied on northbound riverboats to receive staple commodities from the Cumberland and Tennessee valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooling |first=Benjamin |title=Forts Henry and Donelson: The Key to the Confederate Heartland |year=1987 |publisher=The University of Tennessee Press |location=Knoxville |isbn=0-87049-538-0 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of using the rivers to breach the Confederate defense line in the West was well known by the end of 1861; Union gunboats had been scanning Confederate fort-building on the twin rivers for months before the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooling |first=Benjamin |title=Forts Henry and Donelson: The Key to the Confederate Heartland |year=1987 |publisher=The University of Tennessee Press |location=Knoxville |isbn=0-87049-538-0 |pages=65, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and the [[United States Navy]] captured control of the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers in February 1862 and held off the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] counterattack at [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]] in April of the same year.

Capture of [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] gave the Union control of the Western and Middle [[Grand Divisions (Tennessee)|sections]]. Control was confirmed at the battle of [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]] in early January 1863. After Nashville was captured (the first Confederate state capital to fall) Andrew Johnson, an East Tennessean from [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]], was appointed military governor of the state by Lincoln. During this time, the military government abolished [[slavery]] (but with questionable legality). The Confederates continued to hold East Tennessee despite the strength of Unionist sentiment there, with the exception of strongly pro-Confederate [[Sullivan County, Tennessee|Sullivan]] and [[Rhea County, Tennessee|Rhea]] Counties.

===1863===
After winning a victory at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]] in September 1863, the Confederates besieged [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] but were finally driven off by Grant in November. Many of the Confederate defeats can be attributed to the poor leadership of General [[Braxton Bragg]], who led the [[Confederate States Army|Army of Tennessee]] from [[Shiloh, Hardin County, Tennessee|Shiloh]] to the Confederate defeat at Chattanooga.  Historian Thomas Connelly concludes that although Bragg was an able planner and a skillful organizer, he failed repeatedly in operations, in part because he was unable to collaborate effectively with his subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Connelly, '' Autumn of Glory: The Army of Tennessee, 1862–1865'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;

===1864===
The last major battles came when the General [[John Bell Hood]] led the Confederates north in November 1864. He was checked at [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]], and his army [[Battle of Franklin (1864)|was virtually destroyed]] by [[George Henry Thomas|George Thomas]]'s greatly superior forces at Nashville in December.

==Government and politics==
Fear of subversion was widespread throughout the state. In West and Middle Tennessee it was fear of pro-Union activism, which was countered proactively by numerous local Committees of Safety and Vigilance from 1860 to 1862. They emerged as early as the 1860 Presidential election, and when the war began activists developed an aggressive program to detect and suppress Unionists. The committees set up a spy system, intercepted mail, inspected luggage, forced the enlistment of men into the Confederate Army, confiscated private property, and whenever it seemed necessary lynched enemies of the Confederacy. The committees were disbanded by the Union Army when it took control in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Jones, Jr., "'The Reign of Terror of the Safety Committee Has Passed Away Forever': A History of Committees of Safety and Vigilance in West and Middle Tennessee, 1860–1862," ''West Tennessee Historical Society Papers'', 2009, Vol. 63, pp 1-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unionism and East Tennessee===
[[File:TN Slavery Ownership by Region.jpg|thumb|left|Slave % of total population in each region of Tennessee]]
East Tennessee was a stronghold of Unionism; most slaves were house servants—luxuries—rather than the base of plantation operations. The dominant mood strongly opposed secession.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas B. Alexander, "Whiggery and Reconstruction in Tennessee," ''The Journal of Southern History'', Vol. 16, No. 3 (August, 1950), pp. 291-305 [https://www.jstor.org/pss/2197744 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Tennesseans representing twenty-six East Tennessee counties met twice in Greeneville and Knoxville and agreed to secede from Tennessee (see [[East Tennessee Convention of 1861]].) They petitioned the state legislature in Nashville, which denied their request to secede and sent Confederate troops under [[Felix Zollicoffer]] to occupy East Tennessee and prevent secession. The region thus came under Confederate control from 1861 to 1863. Nevertheless East Tennessee supplied significant numbers of troops to the Federal army. ''(See also [[Nickajack]]).'' Many East Tennesseans engaged in guerrilla warfare against state authorities by [[East Tennessee Bridge Burnings|burning bridges]], cutting telegraph wires, and spying for the North.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll Van West, ed., ''Tennessee History: the Land, the People, and the Culture''. James McDonough "Tennessee in the Civil War" 1998. p 155&lt;/ref&gt;  East Tennessee became an early base for the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the South.  Strong support for the Union challenged the Confederate commanders who controlled East Tennessee for most of the war. Generals [[Felix K. Zollicoffer]], [[Edmund Kirby Smith]], and [[Sam Jones (Confederate Army officer)|Sam Jones]] oscillated between harsh measures and conciliatory gestures to gain support, but had little success whether they arrested hundreds of Unionist leaders or allowed men to escape the Confederate draft. Union forces finally captured the region in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;Noel Fisher, "'The leniency shown them has been unavailing': The Confederate occupation of East Tennessee," ''Civil War History'', Dec 1994, Vol. 40 Issue 4, pp 275-91&lt;/ref&gt; General William Sherman's famous [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]] saw him personally escorted by the [[1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment (Union)|1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment]], which consisted entirely of Unionist southerners. Despite its name, the regiment consisted largely of men from Tennessee.

==Economy==
Refugees poured into Nashville during the war, because jobs were plentiful in the depots, warehouses and hospitals serving the war effort, and furthermore the city was much safer place than the countryside. Unionists and Confederate sympathizers both flooded in, as did free blacks and escaped slaves, and businessmen from the North.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, 1985; Durham 1987&lt;/ref&gt; There was little heavy industry in the South but the Western Iron District in Middle Tennessee was the largest iron producer in the Confederacy in 1861. One of the largest operations was the Cumberland Iron Works, which the Confederate War Department tried and failed to protect.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Thomas Gavin, "War Comes to Iron Country: Middle Tennessee's Defense Industry during the Civil War," ''West Tennessee Historical Society Papers'', 2009, Vol. 63, pp 82-108&lt;/ref&gt; Memphis and Nashville, with very large transient populations, had flourishing red light districts. Union wartime regulations forced prostitutes to purchase licenses and pass medical exams, primarily to protect [[soldiers]] from venereal disease. Their trade was deregulated once military control ended.&lt;ref&gt;Jeannine Cole, "'Upon the Stage of Disorder:' Legalized Prostitution in Memphis and Nashville, 1863–1865," ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'', Spring 2009, Vol. 68 Issue 1, pp 40-65&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After the war, Tennessee adopted a constitutional amendment forbidding human property on February 22, 1865;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/chronol.htm|title=Freedmen and Southern Society Project: Chronology of Emancipation|author=|date=|website=www.history.umd.edu|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.tn.us/tsla/exhibits/blackhistory/timelines/timeline_1861-1865.htm|title=TSLA::This Honorable Body: African American Legislators in 19th Century Tennessee&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;|author=|date=|website=state.tn.us|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ratified the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] on July 18, 1866; and was the first state readmitted to the Union on July 24, 1866. Because it ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, Tennessee was the only state that seceded from the Union that did not have a military governor during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. This did not placate those unhappy with the Confederate defeat. Many white Tennesseans resisted efforts to expand suffrage and other civil rights to the freedmen.

For generations white Tennesseans had been raised to believe that slavery was justified. Some could not accept that their former slaves were now equal under the law. When the state Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of African American suffrage in 1867, the reaction became stronger.  The ''Nashville Republican Banner'' on January 4, 1868, published an editorial calling for a revolutionary movement of white Southerners to unseat the one-party state rule imposed by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and restore the legal inferiority of the region's black population.

"In this State, reconstruction has perfected itself and done its worst. It has organized a government which is as complete a closed corporation as may be found; it has placed the black man over the white as the agent and prime-move of domination; it has constructed a system of machinery by which all free guarantees, privileges and opportunities are removed from the people.... The impossibility of casting a free vote in Tennessee short of a revolutionary movement&amp;nbsp;... is an undoubted fact."

The ''Banner'' urged its readers to ignore the presidential election and direct their energy into building "a local movement here at home" to end Republican rule.&lt;ref&gt;cited in Harcourt 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 1860 census, African Americans made up only 25% of Tennessee's population, which meant they could not dominate politics. Only a few African Americans served in the Tennessee legislature during Reconstruction, and not many more as state and city officers. However, the Nashville ''Banner'' may have been reacting to increased participation by African Americans on that city's council, where they held about one-third of the seats.&lt;ref&gt;W.E.B. Du Bois, ''Black Reconstruction in America, 1860–1880'', New York: Oxford University Press, 1935; reprint New York: Free Press,1998, p.575.&lt;/ref&gt; Tennessee has strong Confederate memories (based in West Tennessee and Middle Tennessee), which focused on the [[Lost Cause]] theme of heroic defense of traditional liberties. To a lesser extent Tennesseans celebrate Unionist memories based in East Tennessee and among blacks.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Williams, "The Tennessee Civil War Centennial Commission: Looking to the Past as Tennessee Plans for the Future," ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'', Winter 2008, Vol. 67 Issue 4, pp 270-345&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Archaeological Journal''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] for [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[architecture|architectural]] reports and articles. It was established in 1844 by the [[British Archaeological Association]] as a quarterly journal, but was taken over by the [[British Archaeological Institute]]  (now known as the Royal Archaeological Institute) in 1845, and remained published by them ever since. The journal has been published annually since 1927.

== History ==
The ''Archaeological Journal'' was established as a quarterly journal of the [[British Archaeological Association]] in 1844. When conflicts within that association led to the foundation of the rival British Archaeological Institute (nowadays the [[Royal Archaeological Institute]]) in 1845, the institute retained the journal, the association instead publishing the ''[[Journal of the British Archaeological Association]]''. Publication was quarterly (sometimes falling to twice or thrice in a year) until 1926. In 1927 the journal became an annual publication. From volume 51 (1894), issues bore the notice "second series".

== Publication history ==
The publisher of the journal has been variously listed as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=copac@mimas.ac.uk |url=http://copac.ac.uk/search?rn=1&amp;isn=0066-5983 |title=Item 1 of 4 for 'Identifier: 0066-5983' |publisher=Copac |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Edinburgh School''' refers to a group of 20th century artists connected with [[Edinburgh]]. Most studied at [[Edinburgh College of Art]] during or soon after the [[First World War]], and some taught there together in the mid-20th century. As friends and colleagues, they discussed painting and were influenced by one another's work. Art critic Giles Sutherland, writing in ''[[The Times]]'', has suggested: "The work of the Edinburgh School is characterised by virtuoso displays in the use of paint, vivid and often non-naturalistic colour and themes such as still-life, seascape and landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Giles Sutherland, the British art critic and writer, in ''The Times'' 6 Oct 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are generally thought of as Edinburgh School painters.

*[[William Crozier (Scottish artist)|William Crozier]]&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with the artist [[William Crozier (Irish artist)|William Crozier]] who was born in Glasgow in 1930 and is associated with both Ireland and Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;   (1893–1930)
*[[William Geissler]] (1894–1963)
*[[William George Gillies|Sir William Gillies]] (1898–1973)
*[[William MacTaggart|Sir William MacTaggart]]&lt;ref&gt;William MacTaggart is often known as Sir William MacTaggart or William MacTaggart the Younger, to distinguish him from his grandfather [[William McTaggart]] (no 'a' after the 'M') who was also a painter.&lt;/ref&gt; (1903–1981)
*[[John Maxwell (artist)|John Maxwell]] (1905–1962)
*[[Robin Philipson|Sir Robin Philipson]] (1916–1992)
*[[Anne Redpath]] (1895–1965)
*[[Adam Bruce Thomson]] (1885–1976)

Some other painters associated with Edinburgh may also be called Edinburgh School artists, or a 'new generation' of the Edinburgh School.

==Notes==
&lt;references/&gt;

The 'Edinburgh School' refers to a group of artists whose work shares certain characteristics and is not the same as the '[[Edinburgh School of Art]]'. This latter name is quite often used for the college even though it has been officially called Edinburgh College of Art since 1907.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11329">[[File:Tomb of Avshalom in the Kidron Valley;.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tomb of Absalom]]

'''Tomb of Absalom''' ({{Lang-he|יד אבשלום}}, [[Transliteration|Transl.]] ''Yad Avshalom''; literally ''Absalom's Shrine''), also called '''Absalom's Pillar''', is an ancient [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|monumental rock-cut tomb]] with a [[conical roof]] located in the [[Kidron Valley]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Although traditionally ascribed to [[Absalom]], the rebellious son of [[King David]] of Israel (circa 1000 BCE), recent scholarship has attributed it to the 1st century CE.

Absalom's Pillar, a tomb in itself, also served as a funeral monument to the burial cave system located behind it, the "Cave of Jehoshaphat". The freestanding monument contains a burial chamber with three burial sites. The chamber is carved out of the solid lower section of the monument, but can only be accessed from the upper section via a built entrance and a staircase.

==Description==
Absalom's Pillar is approximately {{convert|20|m}} in height. The monument proper stands on a square '''base''' and consists of two distinct parts. The '''lower section''' is a monolith, hewn out of the rocky slope of the [[Mount of Olives]], while the '''upper part''', rising higher than the original bedrock, is built of neatly cut [[ashlar]]s.
 
[[File:Absalom's Tomb, Valley of Jehoshaphat, Mount of Olives, Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|[[Stereo card]] by [[T.W. Ingersoll]]]]
The lower half is thus a solid, almost perfectly [[cube|cubical]] monolithic block, about {{convert|6|m|abbr=on}} square by {{convert|6.4|m|abbr=on}} high, surrounded on three sides by passageways which separate it from the vertically-cut rock of the Mount of Olives. It is decorated from the outside on each side by pairs of [[Ionic order|Ionic]] half-columns, flanked in the corners by quarter-columns and pillars (a so-called [[distyle in antis]] arrangement). The four square facades are crowned by a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[frieze]] of [[triglyph]]s and [[Metope (architecture)|metopes]] and an Egyptian [[cornice]]. 
 
The upper, ashlar-built part of the monument consists of three differently-shaped segments: a square base set on top of the Egyptian cornice of the lower part, followed by a round [[Tholobate|drum]] crowned by a rope-shaped decoration, which sustains a conical roof with concave sides (the easily recognisable "hat"), topped by a half-closed [[Nymphaea|lotus]] flower. The upper part of the monument corresponds to the outline of a classical [[Tholos (architecture)|tholos]] and is not unlike contemporary [[Nabatean]] structures from [[Petra]].

On the inside, the upper part of the monument is mostly hollow, with a small arched entrance on the south side set above the seam area (where the masonry part starts). Inside this entrance a short staircase leads down to a '''burial chamber''' carved out of the solid, lower section. The chamber is {{convert|2.4|m}} square, with [[arcosolium]] graves on two sides and a small burial niche. The tomb was found empty when first researched by archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;"Archaeological Supplement: Absalom's Pillar", in ''Thompson Chain-Reference Bible'', 1964 edition, p. 311. Retrieved on 2009-11-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating==
An analysis of the architectural styles used indicates that the monument's construction and its first stage of use happened during the 1st century CE.&lt;ref name="Kloner-Zissu-141-143"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kloner |first=Amos |last2=Zissu |first2=Boaz |title=The Necropolis Of Jerusalem in the Second Temple Period |year=2003 |pages=141–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hachlili"&gt;Hachlili, Rachel. [https://books.google.com/books?redir_esc=y&amp;hl=ro&amp;id=8BgLu74SWbAC&amp;q=Qidron#v=snippet&amp;q=Absalom&amp;f=false  Jewish Funerary Customs, Practices and Rites in the Second Temple Period]. Boston: Brill, Leiden, 2005. Pages 30-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

The irregular-shaped holes made into the monument are of later date, probably from the [[History of Jerusalem#Post-Crisis Roman and Early Byzantine Empire period|Byzantine period]]. Even the original entrance has been widened in such rather defacing manner. See also under [[Tomb of Absalom#Inscriptions|Inscriptions]] below.

==Traditional attribution==
Absalom's shrine has traditionally been identified as the monument of Absalom, rebellious son of King David, based on a verse in the [[Book of Samuel]]:&lt;ref name=GTI&gt;{{cite book |title= The Guide to Israel |author= Zev Vilnay |publisher= Hamakor Press |location= Jerusalem |year= 1970 |chapter= Pillar of Absalom |pages= 157-158}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|''Absalom in his lifetime had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king's dale: for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance: and he called the Monument after his own name: and it is called unto this day, Absalom's Monument''. {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:18|}}}}
 
This attribution was quite persistent, although the Book of Samuel reports that Absalom's body was covered over with stones in a pit in the [[Wood of Ephraim]] ({{bibleverse|2|Samuel|18:17|}}).
 
For centuries, it was the custom among passersby—Jews, Christians and [[Islam|Muslims]]—to throw stones at the monument. Residents of Jerusalem would bring their unruly children to the site to teach them what became of a rebellious son.&lt;ref name=GTI/&gt;

The ''Monument of Absalom'' existed in the days of [[Josephus]], and was referred to in his ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'', vii. 10, § 3. Cited in ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern scholarship==
The tomb's exterior design features a [[Doric order|Doric]] [[frieze]] and [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]], both being styles originating in [[ancient Greece]] and introduced into Judah during the [[Seleucid Empire]], centuries after the death of Absalom. At the start of the 20th century, the monument was considered most likely to be that of [[Alexander Jannaeus]], the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean]] king of Judea from 103 to 76 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Conder, in ''[[Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible]]'', article "Jerusalem," p. 597). Cited in ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' 1906&lt;/ref&gt; However, archaeologists have now dated the tomb to the 1st century AD.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

In a 2013 conference, Professor [[Gabriel Barkay]] suggested that it could be the tomb of [[Herod Agrippa]], the grandson of [[Herod the Great]], based in part on the similarity to Herod's newly discovered tomb at [[Herodium]].

===''Nefesh'' to the Tomb of Jehoshaphat===
Archeologically, the so-called "Tomb of Absalom" is not only a burial structure in its own right, with its upper part serving as a ''nefesh'' or funeral monument for the tomb in its lower part, but it was probably also meant as a ''nefesh'' for the adjacent burial cave system known as the '''Cave''' or '''Tomb of Jehoshaphat''', with which it forms one entity, built at the same time and following a single plan.&lt;ref name="Hachlili"/&gt;

During the times of the [[Second Temple]], many wealthy citizens of Jerusalem would have monuments built adjacent to their family burial caves. These monuments were built according to the architectural fashions of the time, many times with a [[pyramid]] on top, or in this case, a cone. Jewish [[Wise old man|sages]] of that era opposed the building of such monuments by saying: "You do not make ''Nefashot'' for the righteous; their words are their commiseration."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Talmud]], Shekalim, 47a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
In 2003, a 4th-century inscription on one of the walls of the monument was deciphered. It reads, ''This is the tomb of Zachariah, the martyr, the holy priest, the father of John''. This suggests that it was the burial place of the Temple priest [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]], father of [[John the Baptist]],&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;{{cite news |author= Amiram Barkat |url= https://www.haaretz.com/1.5348158 |title= Jewish Yad Avshalom revealed as a Christian shrine from Byzantine era |newspaper= [[Haaretz]] |date=22 July 2003 |access-date=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who lived 400 or so years earlier than the inscription date.  

This inscription is part of a secondary usage of this monument during the [[Byzantine]] period, where [[Christian]] [[monk]]s commemorated stories from the Christian Bible inside old Jewish tombs in the Kidron Valley. The Zechariah inscription has led to confusion with the nearby "[[Tomb of Zechariah]]", which commemorates a much earlier figure, the prophet [[Zechariah ben Jehoiada]], according to local folklore; however, it is not a tomb and might also be a monument for the nearby burial cave of the [[Tomb of Benei Hezir|priestly family of Hezir]].

Another inscription discovered in 2003 says the monument is the tomb of "[[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]] who was a very just man and a very devoted old (person) and waiting for the consolation of the people". The passage is identical to {{Bibleref2|Luke 2:25}} as it appears in the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], a 4th-century version of the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nbcnews.com/id/3541452/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/gospel-verse-found-ancient-shrine/#.UkkpiRC3Gts |title= Gospel verse found on an ancient shrine |date= November 20, 2003 |agency= Associated Press |publisher= NBC News |access-date=August 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
According to a local legend, [[Napoleon]] fired a [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]] at the tomb, and removed the shape of a hand that topped the conical roof.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern, A (2006) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=N4q25b69yQ8C&amp;pg=PA11  Hastening Redemption: Messianism and the Resettlement of the Land of Israel]'', p. 11, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-530578-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Napoleon never reached Jerusalem during [[French Invasion of Egypt (1798)|his campaign]] in the [[Holy Land]]. Actually, the top of the monument is not at all broken, but rather is carved to resemble a llotus flower.&lt;ref name="Kloner-Zissu-141-143"/&gt;

A Muslim tradition connects the tomb to the [[Pharaoh]]s, hence the Arabic name "Pharaoh's Hat".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=324443  Haaretzm], ".....he letters emerged".

A '''vile vortex''' is any of twelve purported particular geographic areas, arranged in a pattern around the Earth. The term was coined by [[Ivan T. Sanderson]], who cataloged them as the sites of unexplained disappearances and other mysterious phenomena.&lt;ref name="Twelve Devil's"&gt;{{cite journal | magazine=Saga | title=The Twelve Devil's Graveyards Around the World | date=1972 | first=Ivan T. | last=Sanderson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Neilson &gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Neilson | first1 = Brett. | title = Free trade in the Bermuda Triangle — and other tales of counterglobalization | year = 2004 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | isbn = 0-8166-3871-3 | pages = 44–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Ivan T. Sanderson asserts that twelve vortices (famously, the [[Bermuda Triangle]]) are situated along particular lines of latitude:&lt;ref name=Neilson /&gt; five of the vortices are on the same latitude to the south of the equator; five are on the same latitude to the north. The other two are the north and south poles.&lt;ref name="Invisible Residents"&gt;{{cite book | title=Invisible Residents: The Reality of Underwater UFOs | first=Ivan T. | last=Sanderson | publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press | location=Kempton, IL | date=2005 | oclc=61504967 | isbn=9781931882200 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_BKYTHMBLj8C | accessdate=December 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea has been taken up by other fringe writers, who have argued that the vortices are linked to "subtle matter energy", "[[ley line]]s", or "electro-magnetic aberration". The phenomenon is addressed as geometric patterns as explored by Plato, in the book ''Anti-gravity and the World Grid''.&lt;ref name="Anti-gravity and the World Grid"&gt;{{cite book | title=Anti-gravity and the World Grid | first=David Hatcher | last=Childress | date=1987 | series=Lost Science Series | oclc=15492200 | isbn=9780932813039 | publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press | location=Stelle, IL | page=35 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFikVd65GeMC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35 | accessdate=December 6, 2015}} [http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/antigravityworldgrid/ciencia_antigravityworldgrid.htm bibliotecapleyades.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Begg, in a series of articles for ''[[The Unexplained (magazine)|The Unexplained]]'' magazine, criticized the methodology of writers on the subject of [[unexplained disappearances]]. He checked original records of the alleged incidents. Often, he found, the ships which were claimed to have mysteriously disappeared actually had a mundane reason for their loss (for instance ''[[Raifuku Maru]]''). Some were lost in storms, although the vortex writers would claim that the weather was fine at the time. In other cases, locations of losses were changed to fit the location of the vortex. Sometimes no record was found that the ship had ever existed.&lt;ref&gt;Begg, Paul. "Tales from the Bermuda Triangle" and succeeding articles, reprinted in ''Out of This World: Mysteries of Mind, Space and Time'' (Caxton, 1989), pp 8&amp;ndash;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In media==
In the dramatized TV episode "The Devil's Graveyards" by History Channel, the phenomenon is explored as a result of [[magnetism]], also citing Sanderson and a variety of other sources. The show attributes a pattern of violent animal behavior and global warming to vile vortices, based on the magnetic changes in the Earth's rotation, with the vortices having been possibly created or exacerbated by intelligent means.&lt;ref name="The Devil's Graveyards"&gt;{{cite episode | episode=180 | season=1 | series=History Specials | title=The Devil's Graveyards | date=November 1, 2014 | publisher=History Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt;
