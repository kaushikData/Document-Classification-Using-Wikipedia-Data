'''.as''' is the [[Internet]] [[country code]] [[top-level domain]] ([[ccTLD]]) for [[American Samoa]]. It is administered by [[AS Domain Registry]].

==Usage==
There is no restriction on the nationality of registrants, and many '''.as''' names are registered to and used by people, companies and organizations with no connection to American Samoa (as example, people and organizations related to [[Asturias]], a Spanish region).  "AS" or "A/S" is a suffix indicating a [[joint stock company]] in some countries including [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]] and [[Czech Republic]], so this TLD may be of use by companies of this sort. Also, some [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]] or websites providing information about autonomous systems or [[Border Gateway Protocol|BGP]], such as bgp4.as, have registered domain names.
It is, sometimes, used as a [[domain hack]], since the suffix "-s" means plural in some languages like English and Spanish, thus "-as" would be the end of the plural of a word that ends with an "a". An example of that is the Brazilian website escol.as, meaning "schools".

==Vulnerability==
In April 2016, a security researcher uncovered a vulnerability in the AS Domain Registry which exposed plain-text passwords of .as domain owners, administrators, billing and technical contacts, and further allowed anyone to modify or delete .as domain records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://isecguy.wordpress.com/2016/04/25/flaw-allowed-anyone-to-modify-take-control-over-any-as-domain/ Flaw allowed anyone to modify &amp; take control over ANY .as domain] 2016-04-25&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Anton Brees Carillon Library''', located within the Singing Tower at [[Bok Tower Gardens]], is home to various collections that document the history and development of the Singing Tower and Gardens, the historic [[Pinewood Estate]], and the Guild of Carillonneurs in North America.  It also contains many sources on [[Carillon|carillon art]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;Bok Tower Gardens. (1981). Bok Tower Gardens Foundation, Inc., c1981].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[library]] was created in 1968 following the death of Anton Brees, the first carillonneur at the Singing Tower.  It is named in his honor. A Carillon is a musical instrument consisting of at least 23 tuned bells in chromatic series, played from a keyboard. A carillonneur is the individual that plays this instrument. The Bok Tower was created in 1929, along with magnificent gardens and its unique Singing Tower Carillon. Edward W. Bok was the Founder of the Bok Tower and its gardens, which was originally intended as a bird sanctuary. The Anton Brees Library was created later and for a number of reasons no individuals are allowed inside the library. Historical materials from the library are available through an online catalog and digital collections. In-person access to the collections is available by appointment only &lt;ref name="boktowergardens" /&gt;.  

==Holdings==
The Anton Brees Carillon Library is located on the fifth level of the Singing Tower. It is one of the largest collections of carillon-related materials in the world.

[[File:Bok Tower.png|thumbnail|The Bok Tower, home of the Anton Brees Carillon Library.]]

While a relatively small collection with approximately 1,500 books of carillon and related literature, it is the scope of its holdings and [[ephemera]] that makes the library unique.  In addition to these books, the library also house 900 volumes of trade journals devoted to various aspects of carillon art and related industries.  Most important, though, is its collection of over 3,000 musical scores written for the carillon.  The library also has 3,000 audio and video recordings and, musical scores for [[keyboard instruments]], and various documents relating to carillon concerts and biographies.&lt;ref name="boktowergardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boktowergardens.org/tower-gardens/library-archives/|title=Library &amp; Archives|author=Bok Tower Gardens|work=boktowergardens.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the library includes information on North American and foreign carillons, individuals, and bell foundries.

These collections are the ABCL vertical files, [http://www.gcna.org/ Guild of Carillonneurs in North America] Archives, Ronald Barnes Collection, Anton Brees Collection, Sidney Giles Collection, and the Arthur Bigelow Collection.&lt;ref name="boktowergardens"/&gt;

'''Ashis Nandy''' ({{lang-bn|‡¶Ü‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∏ ‡¶®‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡ßÄ}}; born 1937) is an Indian [[Political psychology|political psychologist]], [[social theorist]], and critic. A trained [[clinical psychologist]], Nandy has provided theoretical critiques of [[European colonialism]], development, modernity, secularism, [[Hindutva]], science, technology, [[nuclearism]], cosmopolitanism, and utopia. He has also offered alternative conceptions relating to cosmopolitanism and critical traditionalism. In addition to the above, Nandy has offered an original historical profile of India's commercial cinema as well as critiques of state and violence.

He was Senior Fellow and Former Director of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS) for several years. Today, he is a Senior Honorary Fellow at the institute and apart from being the Chairperson of the Committee for Cultural Choices and Global Futures, also in New Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.emory.edu/Bahri/NANDY.HTM Ashis Nandy] [[Emory University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csds.in/faculty_ashis_nandy.htm Ashis Nandy ‚Äì Senior Honorary Fellow] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504181121/http://www.csds.in/faculty_ashis_nandy.htm |date=4 May 2009 }} [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS) website.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nandy had received the [[Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize ‚Äì Laureates for 2007 | url = http://www.asianmonth.com/prize/english/18/index.html | publisher = The Fukuoka Asian Culture Prizes | accessdate = 19 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he appeared on the list of the [[Top 100 Public Intellectuals Poll]] of the [[Foreign Policy]] magazine, published by The [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Top 100 Public Intellectuals| url = https://foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4314#bios |date = May 2008| publisher = Foreign Policy | accessdate=19 November 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205141738/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/story/cms.php?story_id=4314| archivedate= 5 December 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Nandy was born in a [[Bengali people|Bengali]] [[Christians in India|Christian]] family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 25, yet no Christian| url = http://www.heraldofindia.com/article.php?id=332| publisher = [[The Herald of India]]| accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A short pause| url = http://www.rediff.com/news/2000/jan/12nandy.htm|date = 12 January 1999| publisher = [[Rediff]]| accessdate=27 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Bhagalpur]], Bihar, in 1937. He is the eldest of three sons of Satish Chandra Nandy and Prafulla Nalini Nandy, and brother of [[Pritish Nandy]]. Later, his family moved to [[Calcutta]]. Nandy's mother was a teacher at [[La Martiniere Calcutta|La Martiniere School]], [[Calcutta]] and subsequently became the school's first Indian vice principal. When he was 10, British India was partitioned into two sovereign countries ‚Äì India and Pakistan. He witnessed the time of conflicts and atrocities that followed.

Nandy quit medical college before joining [[Hislop College]], [[Nagpur]] to study social sciences. Later he took a master's degree in sociology. However, his academic interest tended increasingly towards clinical psychology and he did his PhD in psychology at Dept. of Psychology, [[Gujarat University]], [[Ahmedabad]].

While a professed non-believer, Nandy identifies with the [[Bengali Christian]] community.&lt;ref&gt;"But as a Christian, do you identify with your community? Yes, I do, even though I am not a believer. I have been a nonbeliever from my teens, much to the sorrow of my parents, who were devout Christians. But I am a product of the Bengali Christian family and culture. I identify with it. I don‚Äôt disown it, particularly because it is such a small community. I do not belong to the majority community, which is 82% of the country‚Äôs population but some of them still feel and behave like a minority. [Laughs]" {{cite web|title = Ashis Nandy on being an Indian Christian, Julio Ribeiro's pain and why he opposes conversion| url = http://scroll.in/article/718353/Ashis-Nandy-on-being-an-Indian-Christian,-Julio-Ribeiro's-pain-and-why-he-opposes-conversion|date = 4 April 2015| publisher = Scroll.in| accessdate=5 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Nandy joined the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] (CSDS), Delhi, as a young faculty member. While working there, he developed his own methodology by integrating [[clinical psychology]] and sociology. Meanwhile, he was invited by a number of universities and research institutions abroad to carry out research and to give them lectures.  He served as the Director of CSDS between 1992 and 1997. He also serves on the Editorial Collective of [[Public Culture]], a reviewed journal published by Duke University Press.

Nandy has coauthored a number of human rights reports and is active in movements for peace, alternative sciences and technologies, and cultural survival. He is a member of the Executive Councils of the [[World Futures Studies Federation]], the [[Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative]], the International Network for Cultural Alternatives to Development, and the [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]]. Nandy has been a Woodrow Wilson Fellow at the [[Wilson Center]], Washington, D.C., a Charles Wallace Fellow at the [[University of Hull]], and a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Humanities, [[University of Edinburgh]]. He held the first UNESCO Chair at the Center for European Studies, [[University of Trier]], in 1994. In 2006 he became the National Fellow of the [[Indian Council of Social Science Research]].

Professor Nandy is an intellectual who identifies and explores numerous and diverse problems. He has written extensively in last two decades. His 1983 book, titled ''The Intimate Enemy: Loss and Recovery of Self Under Colonialism'', talked about the psychological problems posed at a personal level by colonialism, for both coloniser and colonised. Nandy argues that the understanding of self is intertwined with those of race, class, and religion under colonialism, and that the Gandhian movement can be understood in part as an attempt to transcend a strong tendency of educated Indians to articulate political striving for independence in European terms. Through his prolific writing and other activities supported by his belief in non-violence, Professor Nandy has offered penetrating analysis from different angles of a wide range of problems such as political disputes and racial conflicts, and has made suggestions about how human beings can exist together, and together globally, irrespective of national boundaries.

==Controversies==
During the [[Jaipur Literature Festival]] held in January 2013, Nandy participated in a panel where he was quoted to have made controversial statements on corruption among "lower" [[caste]]s in India. It was reported that he said,

{{quote|text=It is a fact that most of the corrupt come from OBCs and Scheduled Castes and now increasingly the Scheduled Tribes. I will give an example. One of the states with the least amount of corruption is state of West Bengal when the CPI(M) was there. And I must draw attention to the fact that in the last 100&amp;nbsp;years, nobody from OBC, SC and ST has come anywhere near to power. It is an absolutely clean state.&lt;ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''Birthday Stories'''''|„Éê„Éº„Çπ„Éá„Ç§„Éª„Çπ„Éà„Éº„É™„Éº„Ç∫|BƒÅsudei sut≈çrƒ´zu {{=}} Birthday stories}} is a 2002 [[short story]] [[anthology]] edited by [[Japanese author]] [[Haruki Murakami]]. Despite the theme's happy connotations most of the short stories have a dark, melancholic atmosphere.

==Editions==
Murakami selected and translated the texts, adding an original short story of his (later collected into his own ''[[Blind Willow, Sleeping Woman]]'', 2006). For the English edition at Harvill Press (using the original English-language versions of the stories), he added an introduction and selected one more story. For the Japanese reprint, he added two stories. The main editions are thus:

* 2002: Japanese-language, 11 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|51550239}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2004: English-language, 12 stories plus introduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|56458981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2006: Japanese-language, 13 stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{OCLC|63208189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents ==
The 2004 English edition of the anthology starts with an introduction by Haruki Murakami, where he speaks about his birthday and of [[birthday]]s in general (for example he mentions his visit [[Jack London]]'s farm, which he did because he liked London's writings and because they share the same birthday).

It compiles:
* ("Introduction : My birthday, your birthday", by Haruki Murakami ‚Äî added to English ed. only)
* "[[Forever Overhead]]" (by [[David Foster Wallace]])
* "[[Turning (short story)|Turning]]" (by [[Lynda Sexson]])

[[File:Bloomsbury.gif|thumb|right|500px|Some of the members of the Bloomsbury Group]]

The '''Bloomsbury Group'''‚Äîor '''Bloomsbury Set'''‚Äîwas a group of associated English writers, intellectuals, philosophers and artists in the first half of the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;Fargis, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Virginia Woolf]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Lytton Strachey]]. This loose collective of friends and relatives was closely associated with [[Cambridge University]] for the men and [[King's College London]] for the women, and they lived, worked or studied together near [[Bloomsbury]], London. According to Ian Ousby, "although its members denied being a group in any formal sense, they were united by an abiding belief in the importance of the arts."&lt;ref name="Ousby p. 95"&gt;Ousby, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Their works and outlook deeply influenced [[literature]], [[aesthetics]], [[criticism]], and [[economics]] as well as modern attitudes towards [[feminism]], [[pacifism]], and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://bloomsbury.denise-randle.co.uk/intro.htm  The Bloomsbury Group: Artists, Writers &amp; Thinkers]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125061740/http://bloomsbury.denise-randle.co.uk/intro.htm |date=25 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:SomeBloomsburymembers.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Left to right: [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], Maria Nys (neither members of Bloomsbury), [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Duncan Grant]], and [[Vanessa Bell]]]]

All male members of the Bloomsbury Group, except [[Duncan Grant]], were educated at [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] (either at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] or [[King‚Äôs College, Cambridge|King‚Äôs College]]). Most of them, except Clive Bell and the Stephen brothers, were members of "the exclusive [[Cambridge]] society, the '[[Cambridge Apostles|Apostles]]'".&lt;ref name="Blythe p. 54" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadd p. 20" /&gt; At Trinity in 1899 [[Lytton Strachey]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Saxon Sydney-Turner]] and [[Clive Bell]] became good friends with [[Thoby Stephen]], and it was through Thoby and [[Adrian Stephen]]'s sisters [[Vanessa Bell|Vanessa]] and [[Virginia Woolf|Virginia]] that the men met the women of [[Bloomsbury]] when they came down to London.&lt;ref name="Blythe p. 54"&gt;Blythe, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gadd p. 20"&gt;Gadd, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 Vanessa began the "Friday Club" and Thoby ran "Thursday Evenings", which became the basis for the Bloomsbury Group,&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;Tate, Bloomsbury timeline&lt;/ref&gt; which to some was really "Cambridge in London".&lt;ref name="Blythe p. 54" /&gt; Thoby's premature death in 1906 brought them more firmly together&lt;ref name="Gadd p. 20" /&gt; and they became what is now known as the "Old Bloomsbury" group who met in earnest beginning in 1912. In the 1920s and 1930s the group shifted when the original members died and the next generation had reached adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bloomsbury Group, mostly from upper middle-class professional families, formed part of "an intellectual aristocracy which could trace itself back to the [[Clapham Sect]]".&lt;ref name="Blythe p. 54" /&gt; It was an informal network&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, pp. 1, 45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuper p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; of an influential group of artists, art critics, writers and an economist, many of whom lived in [[London postal district|the West Central 1 district of London]] known as [[Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref name="Avery p. 33"&gt;Avery, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; They were "spiritually" similar to the Clapham group who supported its members' careers: "The Bloomsberries promoted one another's work and careers just as the original Claphamites did, as well as the intervening generations of their grandparents and parents."&lt;ref name="Kuper p. 241"&gt;Kuper, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

A historical feature of these friends and relations is that their close relationships all pre-dated their fame as writers, artists, and thinkers.&lt;ref name="Clark p. 56" /&gt;

== Membership ==
[[File:Bloomsbury Group 51 Gordon Square blue plaque.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque, 51 [[Gordon Square]], London]]
{{Main|List of Bloomsbury Group people}}

=== Members ===
The group had ten core members:&lt;ref name="Avery p. 33" /&gt;
{{Div col}}
* [[Clive Bell]], art critic
* [[Vanessa Bell]], post-impressionist painter
* [[E. M. Forster]], fiction writer
* [[Roger Fry]], art critic and post-impressionist painter
* [[Duncan Grant]], post-impressionist painter
* [[John Maynard Keynes]], economist
* [[Desmond MacCarthy]], literary journalist
* [[Lytton Strachey]], biographer
* [[Leonard Woolf]], essayist and non-fiction writer
* [[Virginia Woolf]], fiction writer and essayist
{{div col end}}

In addition to these ten, [[Leonard Woolf]], in the 1960s, listed as 'Old Bloomsbury' [[Adrian Stephen|Adrian]] and [[Karin Stephen]], [[Saxon Sydney-Turner]], and [[Mary (Molly) MacCarthy|Molly MacCarthy]], with [[Julian Bell]], [[Quentin Bell]] and [[Angelica Garnett|Angelica Bell]], and [[David Garnett]]&lt;ref&gt;Knights, S., 2015&lt;/ref&gt; as later additions".&lt;ref name="Lee p. 263"&gt;Lee, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Except for Forster, who published three novels before the highly successful ''Howards End'' in 1910, the group were late developers.&lt;ref name="Gadd, p. 103-7"&gt;Gadd, p. 103-7&lt;/ref&gt;

There were stable marriages and varied and complicated affairs among the individual members.&lt;ref name="Kuper p. 241" /&gt; Lytton Strachey{{refn||group="nb"|name="Duke Library"}} and his cousin and lover [[Duncan Grant]]&lt;ref&gt;Kuger, p. 231‚Äì232&lt;/ref&gt; became close friends of the Stephen sisters, Vanessa Bell and Virginia Woolf. Duncan Grant had affairs with siblings Vanessa Bell and Adrian Stephen, as well as David Garnett, Maynard Keynes, and James Strachey. Clive Bell married Vanessa in 1907, and Leonard Woolf returned from the [[Ceylon Civil Service]] to marry Virginia in 1912. Cambridge Apostle friendships brought into the group Desmond MacCarthy, his wife Molly, and E. M. Forster.&lt;ref name="Gadd p. 20" /&gt;

The group met not only in their homes in Bloomsbury, [[central London]], but also at countryside retreats. There are two significant ones near [[Lewes]] in Sussex: [[Charleston Farmhouse]],{{refn|See [http://www.charleston.org.uk/ Charleston House], A Bloomsbury Home and Garden.|group="nb"}} where Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant moved in 1916, and [[Monk's House]] (now owned by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]),{{refn|Monk's House Photograph albums at Houghton Library, Harvard University: [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:4458847 1863-1938], [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:4394409 1909-1922.], [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:4394410 1890-1933], [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:4395032 1890-1947], [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:4395033 1892-1938] and [http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:FHCL.HOUGH:4420078 1850-1900].|group="nb"}} in [[Rodmell]], owned by Virginia and Leonard Woolf from 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, pp. 208, 430-431, 437&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Much about Bloomsbury appears to be controversial, including its membership and name: indeed, some would maintain that "the three words 'the Bloomsbury group' have been so much used as to have become almost unusable".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

Close friends, brothers, sisters, and even sometimes partners of the friends were not necessarily members of Bloomsbury: Keynes‚Äôs wife [[Lydia Lopokova]] was only reluctantly accepted into the group,&lt;ref name="Clark p. 56"&gt;Clarke, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; and there were certainly "writers who were at some time close friends of Virginia Woolf, but who were distinctly not 'Bloomsbury': [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Katherine Mansfield]], [[Hugh Walpole]]".&lt;ref name="Lee p. 263" /&gt; Another is [[Vita Sackville-West]], who became "[[Hogarth Press]]'s best-selling author".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 447&lt;/ref&gt; Members cited in "other lists might include [[Lady Ottoline Morrell|Ottoline Morrell]], or [[Dora Carrington]], or [[James Strachey|James]] and [[Alix Strachey]]".&lt;ref name="Lee p. 263" /&gt;

==Shared ideas==
The lives and works of the group members show an overlapping, interconnected similarity of ideas and attitudes that helped to keep the friends and relatives together, reflecting in large part the influence of [[G. E. Moore]]: "the essence of what Bloomsbury drew from Moore is contained in his statement that 'one's prime objects in life were love, the creation and enjoyment of aesthetic experience and the pursuit of knowledge'".&lt;ref name="Blythe p. 54"/&gt;

=== Philosophy and ethics ===
Through the Apostles they also encountered the analytic philosophers [[G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] who were revolutionizing British philosophy at the start of the 20th century. Distinguishing between ends and means was a commonplace of ethics, but what made Moore's ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' (1903) so important for the philosophical basis of Bloomsbury thought was Moore's conception of ''intrinsic worth'' as distinct from ''instrumental value''. As with the distinction between love (an intrinsic state) and monogamy (a behavior), Moore's differentiation between intrinsic and instrumental value allowed the Bloomsburies to maintain an ethical high-ground based on intrinsic merit, independent of, and without reference to, the consequences of their actions. For Moore, intrinsic value depended on an indeterminable intuition of good and a concept of complex states of mind whose worth as a whole was not proportionate to the sum of its parts. For both Moore and Bloomsbury, the greatest ethic goods were "the importance of personal relationships and the private life", as well as aesthetic appreciation: "art for art's sake".&lt;ref&gt;Forster, pp. 64, 96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejection of bourgeois habits===
Bloomsbury reacted against current social rituals, "the bourgeois habits&amp;nbsp;... the conventions of Victorian life"&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; with their emphasis on public achievement, in favour of a more informal and private focus on [[personal relationship]]s and individual pleasure. E. M. Forster for example approved of "the decay of smartness and fashion as factors, and the growth of the idea of enjoyment",&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and asserted that "if I had to choose between betraying my country and betraying my friend, I hope I should have the guts to betray my country".&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The Group "believed in pleasure&amp;nbsp;... They tried to get the maximum of pleasure out of their personal relations. If this meant [[Love triangle|triangles]] or more complicated geometric figures, well then, one accepted that too".&lt;ref&gt;Snow, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Yet at the same time, they shared a sophisticated, civilized, and highly articulated ideal of pleasure. As Virginia Woolf put it, their "triumph is in having worked out a view of life which was not by any means corrupt or sinister or merely intellectual; rather ascetic and austere indeed; which still holds, and keeps them dining together, and staying together, after 20 years".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lee, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Politically, Bloomsbury held mainly left-liberal stances (opposed to militarism, for example); but its "clubs and meetings were not activist, like the political organisations to which many of Bloomsbury's members also belonged", and they would be criticised for that by their 1930s successors, who by contrast were "heavily touched by the politics which Bloomsbury had rejected".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 263, 613&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign for women‚Äôs suffrage added to the controversial nature of Bloomsbury, as Virginia Woolf represented the group in the fictional ''The Years'' and ''Night and Day'' works about the suffrage movement.&lt;ref&gt;Koppen, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
Roger Fry joined the group in 1910. His [[post-impressionist]] exhibitions of 1910 and 1912 involved Bloomsbury in a second revolution following on the Cambridge philosophical one. This time the Bloomsbury painters were much involved and influenced.&lt;ref name="Gadd, p. 103-7" /&gt;{{refn|Bloomsbury was also part of Fry‚Äôs extension of post-impressionism into the decorative arts with his [[Omega Workshops]], which lasted until 1920.&lt;ref name="Gadd, p. 103-7" /&gt;|group="nb"}} Fry and other Bloomsbury artists rejected the traditional distinction between fine and decorative art.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, p. 477&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|[http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/bloomsbury/index.html Manuscripts and Woodcuts: Visions and Designs from Bloomsbury ‚Äì Duke University Libraries Digital Collections] Includes 12 woodcuts by [[Roger Fry]] and the manuscript of ''Elizabeth and Essex'' written in [[Lytton Strachey]]'s hand with 7 miscellaneous manuscript letters.|group="nb"|name="Duke Library"}}

These "Bloomsbury assumptions" are reflected in members' criticisms of materialistic realism in painting and fiction, influenced above all by Clive Bell's "concept of 'Significant Form', which separated and elevated the concept of form above content in works of art":&lt;ref&gt;Ousby, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; it has been suggested that, with their "focus on form&amp;nbsp;...Bell's ideas have come to stand in for, perhaps too much so, the aesthetic principles of the Bloomsbury Group".&lt;ref&gt;Tew and Murray, p. 122, 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment's hostility to post-impressionism made Bloomsbury controversial, and controversial they have remained. Clive Bell polemicized{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--a polemic is an attack; but was he attacking post-impressionism, or violently defending it?--&gt; post-impressionism in his widely read book ''Art'' (1914), basing his aesthetics partly on Roger Fry‚Äôs art criticism and G. E. Moore's moral philosophy; and as the war came he argued that "in these days of storm and darkness, it seemed right that at the shrine of civilization - in Bloomsbury, I mean - the lamp should be tended assiduously".&lt;ref name="Lee p. 265"&gt;Lee, p. 265&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War I ===
Old Bloomsbury‚Äôs development was inevitably impacted on, along with just about everything else in [[modernism|modernist]] culture, by the [[First World War]]: indeed, "the small world of Bloomsbury was later said by some on its outskirts to have been irretrievably shattered", though in fact its friendships "survived the upheavals and dislocations of war, in many ways were even strengthened by them".&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; Most but not all of them were conscientious objectors, which of course added to the group‚Äôs controversies. Politically the members of Bloomsbury had liberalism and socialism leanings.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, p. 112, 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the war dispersed Old Bloomsbury, the individuals continued to develop their careers. E. M. Forster followed his successful novels with ''Maurice'' which he could not publish because it treated homosexuality untragically. In 1915 Virginia Woolf brought out her first novel, ''The Voyage Out''. And in 1917 the Woolfs founded their [[Hogarth Press]], which would publish [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Katherine Mansfield]], and many others including Virginia herself along with the standard English translations of [[Freud]]. Then in 1918 Lytton Strachey published his critique of [[Victorian morality|Victorianism]] in the shape of four ironic biographies in ''[[Eminent Victorians]],'' which added to the arguments about Bloomsbury that continue to this day, and "brought him the triumph he had always longed for&amp;nbsp;... The book was a sensation".&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year came J. M. Keynes‚Äôs influential attack on the [[Versailles Peace Treaty]]: "''[[The Economic Consequences of the Peace]]''" immediately established Maynard as an economist of international eminence".&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later Bloomsbury ==
The 1920s were in a number of ways the blooming of Bloomsbury. Virginia Woolf was writing and publishing her most widely read [[Literary modernism|modernist novels and essays]], E. M. Forster completed ''[[A Passage to India]]'', a highly regarded novel on [[British India|British imperialism in India]]. Forster wrote no more novels but he became one of England‚Äôs most influential essayists. Duncan Grant, and then Vanessa Bell, had single-artist exhibitions. Lytton Strachey wrote his biographies of two queens,  Victoria then Elizabeth (and Essex). Desmond MacCarthy and Leonard Woolf engaged in friendly rivalry as literary editors, respectively of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' and ''[[The Nation and Athenaeum]]'', thus fuelling animosities that saw Bloomsbury dominating the cultural scene. Roger Fry wrote and lectured widely on art; meanwhile, Clive Bell applied Bloomsbury values to his book ''Civilization'' (1928), which Leonard Woolf saw as limited and elitist, describing Clive as a "wonderful organiser of intellectual [[greyhound racing]] tracks".&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

In the darkening 1930s, Bloomsbury began to die: "Bloomsbury itself was hardly any longer a focus".&lt;ref&gt;Gadd, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; A year after publishing a collection of brief lives, ''Portraits in Miniature'' (1931),{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Lytton Strachey died;&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum p. xi"&gt;Rosenbaum, p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; shortly afterwards Carrington shot herself. Roger Fry, who had become England‚Äôs greatest art critic, died in 1934.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum p. xi" /&gt; Vanessa and Clive's eldest son, [[Julian Bell]], was killed in 1937 during the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; Virginia Woolf wrote [[Roger Fry: A Biography|Fry's biography]], but with the coming of war again her mental instability recurred, and she drowned herself in 1941.&lt;ref name="Rosenbaum p. xi" /&gt; In the previous decade she had become one of the century's most famous [[List of feminist literature|feminist writers]] with three more novels, and a series of essays including the moving late memoir "[[A Sketch of the Past]]". It was also in the 1930s that Desmond MacCarthy became perhaps the most widely read‚Äîand heard‚Äîliterary critic with his columns in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and his broadcasts with the BBC. John Maynard Keynes's ''[[The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money]]'' (1936) made him one of the century's most influential economists. He died in 1946 after being much involved in monetary negotiations with the United States.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The diversity yet collectivity of Later Bloomsbury's ideas and achievements can be summed up in a series of credos that were done in 1938, the year of the [[Munich Agreement]]. Virginia Woolf published her radical feminist polemic ''[[Three Guineas]]'' that shocked some of her fellow members, including Keynes who had enjoyed the gentler ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929). Keynes read his famous but decidedly more conservative memoir ''My Early Beliefs'' to The Memoir Club. Clive Bell published an [[appeasement]] pamphlet (he later supported the war), and E. M. Forster wrote an early version of his famous essay "[[What I Believe]]" with its choice, still shocking for some, of personal relations over patriotism: his quiet assertion in the face of the increasingly [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] claims of both left and right that "personal relations&amp;nbsp;... love and loyalty to an individual can run counter to the claims of the State".&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 76-7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Memoir Club ==
In March 1920 Molly MacCarthy began the Memoir Club to help Desmond and herself write their memoirs; and also "for their friends to regroup after the war (with the proviso that they should always tell the truth)".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 436&lt;/ref&gt; It met until 1956&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, p. xxxii&lt;/ref&gt; or 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Spalding 1991, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
If "the contempt or suspicion‚Äîthe environment that a person or group creates around itself‚Äîis always a kind of alter ego, an essential and revealing part of the production",&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; there is perhaps much to be learnt from the (extensive) criticism that the Bloomsbury Group aroused. Early complaints focused on a perceived cliquiness: "on personal mannerisms‚Äîthe favourite phrases ('ex-quisitely civilized', and 'How ''simply too'' extraordinary!'), the incredulous, weirdly emphasised Strachey voice".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; After World War I, as the members of the Group "began to be famous, the execration increased, and the caricature of an idle, snobbish and self-congratulatory [[Rentier capitalism|rentier class]], promoting its own brand of high culture began to take shape":&lt;ref name="Lee p. 265" /&gt; as Forster self-mockingly put it, "In came the nice fat dividends, up rose the lofty thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;Forster, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing threats of the 1930s brought new criticism from younger writers of "what the last lot had done (Bloomsbury, Modernism, Eliot) in favour of what they thought of as urgent hard-hitting realism"; while "[[Wyndham Lewis]]'s ''[[The Apes of God]]'', which called Bloomsbury √©litist, corrupt and talentless, caused a stir"&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp. 612, 622&lt;/ref&gt; of its own. The most telling criticism, however, came perhaps from within the Group's own ranks, when on the eve of war Keynes gave a "nostalgic and disillusioned account of the pure sweet air of G. E. Moore, that belief in undisturbed individualism, that Utopianism based on a belief in human reasonableness and decency, that refusal to accept the idea of civilisation as 'a thin and precarious crust'&amp;nbsp;... Keynes's fond, elegiac repudiation of his "early beliefs", in the light of current affairs ("We completely misunderstood human nature, including our own")".&lt;ref&gt;Lee, p. 712&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book on the background of the [[Cambridge Five|Cambridge spies]]&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sinclair, ''The Red and the Blue. Intelligence, Treason and the Universities'' (Coronet Books, Hodder and Stoughten, U.K. 1987) {{ISBN|0-340-41687-4}}. page 33&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Sinclair]] wrote about the Bloomsbury group ''rarely in the field of human endeavour has so much been written about so few who achieved so little''. American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] was quoted in 1999 as saying "I don't like anything that sets itself up as an in-group or an elite, whether it is the Bloomsbury group or [[Jacques Derrida|Derrida]]".&lt;ref name="robertboynton1"&gt;Boynton, Robert S. ''The New York Times Magazine.'' [http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=55 Who Needs Philosophy? A Profile of Martha Nussbaum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Borrowing centers are part of the [[sharing economy]], which was termed in 1984 by Harvard economist Martin Weitzman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Janet Davidson|title=Rise of the borrowing shops|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-in-school/rise-of-the-borrowing-shops/article5823472.ece|publisher=The Hindu (Guardian Newspapers Limited)|accessdate=19 June 2016|date=Mar 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to a [[Rent-to-own|rental store]], which offers many of the same items, borrowing centres are operated on a non-profit or collective basis.

The concept of a borrowing center is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kenny, M. |year=2012 |publisher=York University undergraduate‚Äôs thesis |url=http://fesweb.fes.yorku.ca/research/student-research-titles/bes|accessdate=19 June 2016|title="Borrowing Centres" in Spaces of Resistance: Activist, DIY and Collective Spaces in North America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically some public libraries have offered items beyond print and audio-visual media, such as toys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Moore, Julia E. |year=1995 |publisher=Kent State University master's thesis |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED390414&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED390414|accessdate=23 May 2010|title=A History of Toy Lending Libraries in the United States Since 1935}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is also similar to [[Toy library|toy libraries]], which have existed since at least 1935,  
and [[tool library|tool libraries]].

One of the better-known borrowing centers is the [[Toronto Tool Library|Sharing Depot]] in Toronto, Canada.

== Similar Terms/Concepts ==

Borrowing center is not a popular term to be used, [[Tool library|Tools Library]] shares the same or similar functions and concept as borrowing center and this term has been used more often. The concept of opening tools library is to provide tools which are not daily necessity and to promote the idea of sharing with others. Also it is an sustainable action to save resources on earth.

== Borrowing Centers All Over the World ==


=== North America ===

Tools Library has a very high popularity in the United States, especially in the West Coast, and there is a website ‚ÄúFind Your Local Tool Lending Library - Local Tools‚Äù, which you can find closest Tools Library to you.

1.Tool Library in Berkeley, USA

The First Tool Library started in 1979 in Berkeley, California, and now there are more than 40 tool libraries in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/locations/tool-lending-library|title=Tool Lending Library {{!}} Berkeley Public Library|website=www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

2.Tool Lending library in Oakland, USA

Tool Lending Library offers all kinds of practical tools as well as books, videos and DVDs. And it is free to Oakland, Emeryville, and Piedmont residents and property owners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oaklandlibrary.org/locations/tool-lending-library|title=Tool Lending Library {{!}} Oakland Public Library|website=oaklandlibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

3.Sharing Depot in Toronto, Canada

The Sharing Depot has been called as Canada's First Library of Things and it was opened in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sharingdepot.ca/|title=The Sharing Depot ‚Äì Canada's First Library of Things|website=sharingdepot.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Europe ===

Through a screenshot from the live ‚ÄúMap of Tool Libraries and Libraries of Things‚Äù at Localtool.org, borrowing center is much less common in Europe than in North America. And the reason why there are fewer borrowing center in Europe is unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.didiy.eu/blogs/library-didiy-tools-and-things-movement-still-missing-europe|title=The "Library of (DiDIY) Tools and Things" Movement: still missing in Europe? {{!}} Digital DIY|website=www.didiy.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===

There is merely no this kind of centers in Asian counties, so there is a potential market to develop borrowing centers in Asian countries.

[[Image:Herto, Ethiopia ; Homo sapiens idaltu 1997 discovery map.png|thumb|right|440px|Location of the Bouri Formation and the [[Afar Triangle]] ([[Afar Depression]]), [[Ethiopia]]]]

The '''Bouri Formation''' is a sequence of sedimentary deposits that is the source of [[australopithecine]] and  [[Homo]] (that is, [[hominin]]) fossils, [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s, and bones of large mammals with cut marks from butchery with tools by early [[hominins]]. It is located in the Middle [[Awash Valley]], in [[Ethiopia]], [[East Africa]], and is a part of the [[Afar Depression]] that has provided rich human fossil sites such as Gona and [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]].

The Bouri Formation stretches down much of the length and breadth of the Bouri "peninsula", which projects across the dry bed of the Afar Depression. The Formation is sufficiently eroded to expose three geological members or layers: the Hatayae, the Dakanihylo, and the Herto. Human remains with signs of having been prepared for burial have been found in the Upper Herto layers.

==Geology==
The Bouri "peninsula" is a geological [[Fault (geology)|fault]]-raised  [[Horst (geology)|horst]]  that diverts the [[Awash River]], forming a partial dam and creating [[Lake Yardi]]; and it contains the Bouri Formation. The peninsula is about 4&amp;nbsp;km wide by 10&amp;nbsp;km long, and lies in a NNW-SSE direction in the [[Quaternary]]-period [[rift zone]] in the southern part of the [[Afar Depression]] ([[Afar Triangle]]).

The Bouri Formation is a [[sediment]] area some 80 m thick that stretches down much of the length and breath of the peninsula. The formation consists of three [[geological unit]]s, called members, from which fossils and artifacts of different periods of human evolution have been excavated. They are: the lowest member, named Hatayae, or the Hata, dated to 2.5 millions of years ago (mya)‚Äîand in which fossils of ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'' were found; the Dakanihylo, or Daka, member, one (1) mya‚Äîfossils of [[Homo erectus]] were found; and the Herto member, Lower layer at 260 kya, and Upper layers at 160 to 154 kya‚Äîfossils of [[Homo sapiens idaltu]] were found.&lt;!-------------&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark JD, Beyene Y, WoldeGabriel G, Hart WK, Renne PR, Gilbert H, Defleur A, Suwa G, Katoh S, Ludwig KR, Boisserie JR, Asfaw B, White TD.

The area is important because active [[tectonic]]s in the Afar Depression created varying habitats for early [[hominins]] across the most recent few million years known informally as the [[Plio-Pleistocene]]. These habitats, laid down in sedimentary rocks, have since been [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]], which allowed their [[erosion]] over time and their accessibility today to [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologist]]s.&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"/&gt; Volcanic eruptions have left volcanic [[tuff]] layers that enable accurate dating of the sedimentary deposits via [[Argon‚Äìargon dating]].

==Hatayae==
The Hatayae layer is 40 m thick at its base and is composed of variegated [[silt]] clay and [[paleosol]]s, [[zeolitic]] and [[bentonitic]] tuffs, [[carbonate rock|carbonate]]s that are [[Pedogenesis|pedogenic]], [[sandstone]] with [[bivalve]] and [[gastropod]] shells, and [[mudstone]]. It was deposited in a [[floodplain]]  alongside  [[river delta]] channels and a shallow fluctuating [[lake]] dated to around 2.5 mya.&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"/&gt;

In the Hatayae member have been found the remains of ''[[Australopithecus garhi]]'', the most complete specimen of which is [[BOU-VP-12/130]]. According to Asfaw and White, et al. (1999), that species is "..descended from ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' and is a candidate ancestor for early Homo."&lt;ref name="Asfaw99"/&gt;

[[Excavation (archaeology)|Excavation]]s in general have failed to disclose large numbers of [[stone tool]]s. The likely explanation is the lack of raw materials on lake margins, which, in turn, is likely due to the lack of streams strong enough to carry hand-sized pebbles and the absence of nearby [[outcrop]]s of basalt.&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"/&gt;

In spite of rarity, some isolated and widely scattered cores and flakes of [[Oldowan|Mode I]] technology have been found. The excavators (de Heinzelin, et al., 2002) report: "..our surveys and excavations have demonstrated that early hominids [hominins] were actively using stone tools on the Pliocene-Hata landscape"; and: "It is not currently possible to positively identify the creators of the earliest stone tools here or at Gona, even though ''A. garhi'' is currently the only recognized hominid [hominin] taxon recovered from Hata sediments."&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"/&gt;

Existence of stone tools is also evidenced by bones of large mammals‚Äîsuch as [[alcelaphinae]] (Wildebeest related [[bovid]]s) and [[Hipparion]], an extinct [[genus]] of three-toed horse‚Äîthat show butchery cut marks by hominins including those made in removing an animal‚Äôs tongue.  "These are the earliest documented percussion marks made by hominids [hominins], who were presumably processing these bones for contained fatty marrow"; and, "These are the earliest documented cut marks made by hominids [hominins]."&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"/&gt;  As concluded by the excavators, the evidence from the site shows "..a major function of the earliest known tools was meat and marrow processing of large carcasses."&lt;ref name="de Heinzelin"/&gt; This pattern of butchery processing of large prey was maintained by hominins well into the Pliocene.

==Dakanihylo==
The Dakanihylo (Daka) layer is 22 to 45 m thick and composed of [[pumice]] sandstone that is [[cross-bedding|cross-bedded]]; it is situated in the southern half of the Bouri horst and  dated to 1 mya. Fossils found in the layer suggest open grassland‚Äîsome 377 species of [[bovid]]s (including three new species and two new genera); and water-margin habitats‚Äîspecies of [[Kobus (antelope)|Kobus antelope]] and abundant [[Hippopotamus]].&lt;ref name="Asfaw02"/&gt;
Early [[Acheulean]] stone tools such as [[hand axe]]s and [[Cleaver(tool)|cleaver]]s have also been found in the Daka member, as well as evidence of butchery processing on [[equid]], bovid and hippo bones.&lt;ref name="Asfaw02"/&gt;

''[[Homo erectus]]'' fossils include the specimen [[BOU-VP-2/66]], or the [[Daka skull]], an [[Calvaria (skull)|incomplete skull]] that had an [[Endocranial cast|endocranial]] capacity of 995&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Asfaw02"/&gt;  These fossils (of ''H. erectus'') are important to the current debate as to whether Asian and African ''H. erectus'' were actually different [[Human taxonomy|human species]]. Asfaw, et al. (2002) reports: 1) that these fossils do not support "..the hypothesis of a deep [[cladogenesis]] between African and Asian ''H. erectus'' ..."; and 2) "..that geographic subdivision of early ''H. erectus'' into separate species lineages is biologically misleading, artificially inflating early Pleistocene species diversity."&lt;ref name="Asfaw02"/&gt;  Further, they suggest that "..by 1 Myr the taxon had colonized much of the Old World without speciating. A finding of considerable biogeographic and behavioural significance".&lt;ref name="Asfaw02"/&gt;

==Herto==
The Herto layers consist of a 15‚Äì20 m thick main sequence found in the southwestern part of the Bouri peninsula. The division between the Lower and Upper Herto layers is characterized by an [[erosion surface]] filled with rounded pebbles.

===Lower Herto===
This layer presents [[lignite]], veins of pink carbonate, and silty clays (of predominantly lake origin) containing gastropod and bivalve fossils; it is dated to 260 thousands of years ago (kya). Late [[Acheulean]] tools are found associated with hominin remains as yet unclassified. Humans in this habitat lived next to  a freshwater lake and killed large mammals such as [[hippopotamid]]s.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeHeinzelin J, Clark J D, Schick KD. Gilbert WH. (2000) The Acheulean and the Plio-Pleistocene Deposits of the Middle Awash Valley, Ethiopia. Annales  Sciences g√©ologiques. 104: (whole issue). {{ OCLC|46917504 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper Herto===
The Upper Herto member changes  to yellow sandstone (from the  [[fluvial]] and lake-margin deposits of the lower layer), and dates to between 160 and 154 kya. Immediately above the erosion surface separating the two layers is a sequence of [[volcanic]] sandstone and [[gravel]] deposits of variable thicknesses. It shows cross-bedded sedimentation containing pumice rocks and has produced all the human fossils and tools found in the  Upper layer. The Upper layer is topped by a volcanic tuff.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt; Two volcanic layers of very fine ash occur, one just below the hominin fossils and one just above; this important feature allows accurate [[argon‚Äìargon dating]] of adjacent sedimentary layers and their fossils, as reported above. This is valuable "..because the accurate dating of faunas and artefacts of many sites of this general antiquity in Pleistocene Africa has proved notoriously difficult."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

In this layer have been found early [[Middle Stone Age]] (MSA) tools and the remains of [[Homo sapiens idaltu]]. Most of the tools are [[Scraper (archaeology)|scraper]]s, cleavers, and various [[lithic core]]s; but hand axes, picks and [[Blade (archaeology)|blade]]s are  rare. Most stone tools are made of fine-grained [[basalt]] except for points and blades made from [[obsidian]]. Many are made with the [[Levallois technique]]; these are comparable to those found in the  Garba III layer at [[Melka Kunture]]. &lt;blockquote&gt;As at Herto, Garba III includes terminal Acheulean hand axes, typical Levalloisian method, and many retouched tools on flakes (side-scrapers and end-scrapers, backed knives, burins, unifacial and bifacial points). The Garba III assemblage has been considered transitional between the Acheulean and the MSA.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this layer are found a large number of Hippopotamus bones: "One occurrence shows abundant remains of several hippo calves, mostly newborn to a few weeks old, scattered together with butchered adults".&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

===Mortuary practices===
Of 15 of the 24 recovered fragments of humans in the Upper Herto layer have cut marks due to [[soft tissue]] removal. Clark, et al., (2003) reports that "The latter pattern of bone surface modification is almost never present in hominid [hominin] or nonhuman faunal remains processed for consumption, and is therefore unlikely to represent evidence of utilitarian or economic behaviour." On one skull, "..this defleshing manipulation must have occurred after removal of the mandible. The intentional and deliberate removal of soft tissues such as basicranial vessels, nerves and muscles is therefore indicated. The specimen lacks the entire occipital region surrounding the foramen magnum, and the edges of this broken region are smooth and polished, as are the specimen‚Äôs unweathered parietal surfaces."&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

[[Ethnographic]] study upon modern cultures suggests that such post-mortem manipulation could be due to  "..curation of human remains as part of mortuary practices".&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

'''''Bunnyman''''' (known as '''''The Bunnyman Massacre''''' in the [[United Kingdom]]) is a 2011 [[horror film|horror]] film written, directed and produced by [[Carl Lindbergh]]. The film spawned two sequels, ''[[Bunnyman 2]]'' (Bunnyman Massacre) released in 2014, and ''Bunnyman Vengeance'' which was released on October 20th 2017 on VOD, and November 21st on Blu-ray and DVD.

== Plot ==

After showing [[8 mm film|8 mm]] footage of a handcuffed woman being stabbed to death, the film switches to six friends who are driving through a desolate area when they find themselves being harassed by a truck driven man in a rabbit costume who refuses to communicate with, or show himself to, the travellers. He forces them to pull over and parks behind them. After an indeterminate length of time the costumed man drives away and kills a woman he was holding captive by ripping her in half with chains attached to his truck.

Eventually, the [[Bunny Man|Bunnyman]] returns and causes the group's car to crash, killing Jack a short while later when he rams the vehicle from behind as Jack is working underneath it. The remaining five proceed to travel on foot, encountering a deranged hillbilly, a woman called Melissa and a man who advises them to seek shelter in a supposedly abandoned cabin nearby, saying they will return for them after a trip to the hospital. In reality, the two are disposing of the bodies of some of the Bunnyman's victims. En route to the cabin, two of the quintet spot the Bunnyman butchering bodies and he kills one of them with a chainsaw.

Chased to the cabin which belongs to the Bunnyman, the group loses two more members when Mike is killed with a chainsaw, and Tiffany is captured and tortured to death by the Bunnyman and his demented, hunchbacked accomplice, Pops. After the Bunnyman dismembers Tiffany's body and sits down to eat her flesh with Pops and Melissa, the remaining two travellers, Rachel and John, are captured while trying to get Melissa's car keys. As Melissa prepares to murder a bound Rachel, John manages to free himself from his restraints, kills Melissa and takes her keys and car.

As John and Rachel flee they are chased by the Bunnyman's truck. Concocting a plan the two pull over and John exits the vehicle carrying an unmoving Rachel who he offers to the Bunnyman. The Bunnyman hesitantly takes Rachel and places her in the cab of his truck, where she springs to life and stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors, wounding him, and she kicks him out onto the road and driving away after John gets into the truck. As Rachel laments "We're going to need a lot of therapy" the wounded Bunnyman is shown walking off into the sunset. The credits then roll, alongside more 8mm footage depicting what appears to be the young Bunnyman and his family.

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=May 2017}}
A score of one out of five was awarded by Vegan Voorhees, which described the film as "idiotic" and concluded the review with, "Despite director/writer/producer/actor Lindbergh's impressive enough camera work and production polish, everything that happens in ''Bunnyman'' happens wrong. Like a bitter, out of date [[Easter egg]], it's shiny and pretty on the outside and sickening under the foil". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.hudsonlee.com/?p=8773|title = Hop on by|last = Lee|first = Chrys|publisher = Vegan Voorhees|date = 20 March 2012|website = hudsonlee.com|accessdate = 13 September 2012}} &lt;/ref&gt; 28 Days Later Analysis called ''Bunnyman'' an incompetent and frustrating mess, gave it a "generous" three out of ten, and wrote "atrocious acting, zero character development, no tension, zero sense of pacing, poorly written, continuity errors abound, audio problems, ADR and dubbing, poorly written characters, forced tension, meandering story, etc." &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.28dayslateranalysis.com/2011/12/bunnyman-and-incompetency-movie-review.html|title = ''Bunnyman'' and Incompetency: A Movie Review|last = Allen|first = Michael|publisher = 28 Days Later Analysis|date = 10 December 2010|website = 28dayslateranalysis.com|accessdate = 27 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt; Gorepress also gave an overwhelmingly negative critique, stating "''The Bunnyman Massacre'' is literally the worst film I've seen in years. Decades, even. Why? Well ‚Äì simply put ‚Äì because it's appallingly made on every single level". &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.gorepress.com/2012/02/06/the-bunnyman-massacre/|title = ''The Bunnyman Massacre'' (2012)|last = |first = |publisher = Gorepress|date = 6 February 2012|website = gorepress.com|accessdate = 27 April 2013}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Burmese script}}

The '''Burmese language''' ({{lang-my|·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨·Äò·Ä¨·Äû·Ä¨}}, [[MLC Transcription System|MLCTS]]: ''mranmabhasa'', IPA: {{IPA-my|mj…ôm√† b√†√∞√†|}}) is the [[Sino-Tibetan language]] spoken in [[Myanmar]] where it is an [[official language]] and the language of the [[Bamar people]], the country's principal [[ethnic group]]. Although the [[Constitution of Myanmar]] officially recognizes the English name of the language as the '''Myanmar language''',&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (2008), Chapter XV, Provision 450&lt;/ref&gt; most English speakers continue to refer to the language as ''Burmese'', after ''Burma'', the older name for Myanmar. In 2007, it was spoken as a [[first language]] by 33 million, primarily the [[Bamar people|Bamar (Burman) people]] and related ethnic groups, and as a [[second language]] by 10 million, particularly ethnic minorities in Myanmar and neighboring countries.

Burmese is a [[Tone (linguistics)#Tonal languages|tonal]], [[Register (phonology)|pitch-register]], and [[Isochrony|syllable-timed language]],{{sfn|Chang|2003}} largely [[Syllable|monosyllabic]] and [[analytic language|analytic]], with a [[subject‚Äìobject‚Äìverb]] word order. It is a member of the [[Lolo-Burmese languages|Lolo-Burmese grouping]] of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]]. The [[Burmese alphabet]] is ultimately descended from a [[Brahmic script]], either [[Kadamba alphabet|Kadamba]] or [[Pallava alphabet|Pallava]].

== Classification ==
Burmese belongs to the [[Burmish languages|Southern Burmish]] branch of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]]. Burmese is the most widely spoken of the non-[[Sinitic languages|Sinitic]] Sino-Tibetan languages.{{sfn|Bradley|1993|p=147}} Burmese was the fifth of the Sino-Tibetan languages to develop a writing system, after [[Chinese characters]], the [[Pyu script]], the [[Tibetan alphabet]] and the [[Tangut script]].{{sfn|Bradley|1993|p=147}}

=== Dialects ===
The majority of Burmese speakers, who live throughout the [[Irrawaddy River]] Valley, use a number of largely similar dialects, while a minority speak non-standard dialects found in the peripheral areas of the country. These dialects include:
* [[Tanintharyi Region]]: [[Myeik dialect|Merguese]] (Myeik, Beik), [[Tavoyan dialects|Tavoyan]] (Dawei), and [[Palaw]]
* [[Magway Region]]: [[Yaw dialect|Yaw]]
* [[Shan State]]: [[Intha dialect|Intha]], [[Taungyo]] and [[Danu language|Danu]]

[[Arakanese language|Arakanese]] (Rakhine) in [[Rakhine State]] and [[Marma people|Marma]] in [[Bangladesh]] are also sometimes considered dialects of Burmese and sometimes as separate languages.

Despite vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is [[mutual intelligibility]] among Burmese dialects, as for the most part, they share the same four tones, consonant clusters and the use of the Burmese script. However, several dialects substantially differ in Burmese with respect to vocabulary, lexical particles, and rhymes.

==== Irrawaddy River valley ====
The [[standard language|standard dialect]] of Burmese (the [[Mandalay]]-[[Yangon]] [[dialect continuum]]) comes from the Irrawaddy River valley. Regional differences between speakers from [[Upper Burma]] (e.g., Mandalay dialect), called ''anya tha'' {{lang|my|·Ä°·Ää·Ä¨·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏}}, and speakers from [[Lower Burma]] (e.g., Yangon dialect), called ''auk tha'' {{lang|my|·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏}}, occur in vocabulary choice, not in pronunciation. Minor pronunciation differences do exist within the Irrawaddy River valley. For instance, for the term {{lang|my|·ÄÜ·ÄΩ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏}} "food offering [to a monk]", Lower Burmese speakers use {{IPA|[s ∞ äÃÅ…¥]}} instead of {{IPA|[s ∞w√°…¥]}}, which is the pronunciation used in Upper Burma.

The standard dialect is represented by the Yangon dialect because of the modern city's media influence and economic clout. In the past, the Mandalay dialect represented standard Burmese. The most noticeable feature of the Mandalay dialect is its use of the first person pronoun {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫}} ''kya.nau'' {{IPA-my|t…ï…ôn…î|}} by both men and women, whereas in Yangon, the said pronoun is used only by male speakers while {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Äô}} ''kya.ma.'' {{IPA-my|t…ï…ômaÃ∞|}} is used by female speakers. Moreover, with regard to [[kinship terminology]], Upper Burmese speakers differentiate the maternal and paternal sides of a family whereas Lower Burmese speakers do not.

=== Spread of Burmese in Lower Burma ===
Spoken Burmese is remarkably uniform among Burmese speakers,{{sfn|Barron|Okell|Yin|VanBik|2007|p=16-17}} particularly those living in the Irrawaddy valley, who all use variants of Standard Burmese. The first major reason for the uniformity is the traditional Buddhist monastic education system, which encouraged education and uniformity in language throughout the Upper Irrawaddy valley, the traditional homeland of the Bamar people.

According to the 1891 British census conducted five years after the annexation of the entire country, [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung Burma]] had an "unusually high male literacy" rate where 62.5% of age 25 and over in Upper Burma could read and write. The figure would have been much higher if non-Bamars (e.g., Chins, Kachins, etc.) were excluded. For the whole country, the literacy rate was 49% for men and 5.5% for women.{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=189}}

The migration of Burmese speakers of Bamar descent to Lower Burma is relatively recent. As late as the mid-1700s, the [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] language [[Mon language|Mon]] was the principal language of Lower Burma and the Mon people who inhabited it. After the Burmese-speaking [[Konbaung Dynasty]]'s victory over the Mon-speaking [[Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom]] in 1757, the shift to Burmese began in Lower Burma. By 1830, an estimated 90% of the population in the region identified themselves as Bamar (and, as such, Burmese speakers) due the influx from Upper Burma, assimilation, and intermarriage.{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=202-206}} In the British colonial era, British incentives, particularly geared toward rice production, as well as political instability in Upper Burma, accelerated this migration.

==== Outside the Irrawaddy basin ====
{{Main|Arakanese language|Tavoyan dialects|Intha dialect|Yaw dialect|Myeik dialect}}
More distinctive non-standard varieties emerge as one moves farther away from the Irrawaddy River valley toward peripheral areas of the country. These varieties include the [[Yaw dialect|Yaw]], Palaw, [[Myeik dialect|Myeik]] (Merguese), [[Tavoyan dialects|Tavoyan]] and [[Intha dialect]]s. Despite substantial vocabulary and pronunciation differences, there is mutual intelligibility among most Burmese dialects. Dialects in [[Tanintharyi Region]], including Palaw, Merguese and Tavoyan, are especially conservative in comparison to Standard Burmese. The Tavoyan and Intha dialects have preserved the {{IPA|/l/}} medial, which is otherwise only found in Old Burmese inscriptions. They also often reduce the intensity of the [[glottal stop]]. Myeik has 250,000 speakers&lt;ref name="e18"&gt;{{e18|mya|Burmese}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Tavoyan has 400,000.

The most pronounced feature of the [[Arakanese language]] of [[Rakhine State]] is its retention of the {{IPA-my|…π|}} sound, which has become a {{IPA-my|j|}} sound in standard Burmese. Also, Arakanese features a variety of vowel differences, including the merger of the {{lang|my|·Äß}} {{IPA-my|e|}} and {{lang|my|·Ä£}} {{IPA-my|i|}} vowels. Hence, a word like "blood" {{lang|my|·Äû·ÄΩ·Ä±·Ä∏}} is pronounced {{IPA-my|Œ∏w'''√©'''|}} in standard Burmese and {{IPA-my|Œ∏w'''√≠'''|}} in Arakanese.

Burmese is a diglossic language with two distinguishable [[Register (sociolinguistics)|registers]] (or [[Diglossia|diglossic varieties]]):{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=99}}
# Literary High (H) form{{sfn|Bradley|1995|p=140}} ({{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨·ÄÖ·Ä¨}} ''mranma ca''): the high variety (formal and written), used in literature (formal writing), newspapers, radio broadcasts, and formal speeches
# Spoken Low (L) form{{sfn|Bradley|1995|p=140}} ({{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨·ÄÖ·ÄÄ·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''mranma ca.ka:''): the low variety (informal and spoken), used in daily conversation, television, comics and literature (informal writing)

The literary form of Burmese retains archaic and conservative grammatical structures and modifiers (including particles, markers and pronouns) no longer used in the colloquial form.{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=99}} In most cases, the corresponding grammatical markers in the literary and spoken forms are totally unrelated to each other.{{sfn|Bradley|1996|p=746}} Examples of this phenomenon include the following lexical items:
* "this" (pronoun):  {{small|HIGH}} {{lang|my|·Ä§}} ''i'' ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äí·ÄÆ}} ''di''
* "that" (pronoun): {{small|HIGH}}  {{lang|my|·Äë·Ä≠·ÄØ}} ''htui'' ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äü·Ä≠·ÄØ}} ''hui''
* "at" (postposition): {{small|HIGH}} {{lang|my|·Åå}} ''hnai.'' {{IPA-my|nÃ•a…™ î|}} ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äô·Äæ·Ä¨}} ''hma'' {{IPA-my|mÃ•√†|}}
* plural (marker): {{small|HIGH}}  {{lang|my|·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''mya:'' ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±}} ''twe''
* possessive (marker): {{small|HIGH}}  {{lang|my|·Åè}} ''i.'' ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑}} ''re.''
* "and" (conjunction): {{small|HIGH}}  {{lang|my|·Äî·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫}} ''hnang.'' ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑}} ''ne.''
* "if" (conjunction): {{small|HIGH}}  {{lang|my|·Äú·Äª·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} ''hlyang'' ‚Üí {{small|LOW}} {{lang|my|·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} ''rang''

Historically the literary register was preferred for written Burmese on the grounds that "the spoken style lacks gravity, authority, dignity". In the mid-1960s some Burmese writers spearheaded efforts to abandon the literary form, asserting that the spoken vernacular form ought to be used.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989|p=5‚Äì21}}{{sfn|Aung Bala|1981|p=81‚Äì99}}
Some Burmese linguists such as [[Minn Latt]], a Czech academic, proposed moving away from the high form of Burmese altogether.{{sfn|Aung Zaw|2010|p=2}} Although the literary form is heavily used in written contexts (literary and scholarly works, radio news broadcasts, and novels), the recent trend has been to accommodate the spoken form in informal written contexts.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}} Nowadays, television news broadcasts, comics, and commercial publications use the spoken form or a combination of the spoken and simpler, less ornate formal forms.{{sfn|Bradley|2010|p=99}}

The following sample sentence reveals that differences between literary and spoken Burmese mostly occur in grammatical particles:

Spoken Burmese has politeness levels and [[honorific]]s that take the speaker's status and age in relation to the audience into account. The particle {{lang|my|·Äï·Ä´}} ''pa'' is frequently used after a verb to express politeness.{{sfn|Hnin Tun|San San|2001|p=39}} Moreover, [[Burmese pronouns]] relay varying degrees of deference or respect.{{sfn|Taw Sein Ko|1924|p=68-70}} In many instances, polite speech (e.g., addressing teachers, officials, or elders) employs feudal-era third person pronouns or [[Burmese kinship|kinship terms]] in lieu of first and second person pronouns.{{sfn|Hnin Tun|San San|2001|p=48-49}}{{sfn|Hnin Tun|San San|2001|p=26}} Furthermore, with regard to vocabulary choice, spoken Burmese clearly distinguishes the Buddhist clergy (monks) from the laity ([[Householder (Buddhism)|householders]]), especially when speaking to or about [[bhikkhu]]s (monks).{{sfn|Houtman|1990|p=135-136}} The following are examples of varying vocabulary used for Buddhist clergy and for laity :

* "sleep" (verb): {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä≠·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏}} ''kyin:'' {{IPA-my|t…ï√©…™…¥|}} for monks vs. {{lang|my|·Ä°·Ä≠·Äï·Ä∫}} ''ip'' {{IPA-my|e…™ î|}} for laity
* "die" (verb): {{lang|my|·Äï·Äª·Ä∂·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äô·Ä∞}} ''pyam tau mu'' {{IPA-my|pj√†…¥ d…îÃÄ m√π|}} for monks vs. {{lang|my|·Äû·Ä±}} ''se'' {{IPA-my|Œ∏√®|}} for laity

== Vocabulary ==
Burmese primarily has a monosyllabic received Sino-Tibetan vocabulary. Nonetheless, many words, especially loanwords from [[Indo-European languages]] like English, are polysyllabic, and others, from Mon, an Austroasiatic language, are [[minor syllable|sesquisyllabic]].{{sfn|Wheatley|2013}} Burmese loanwords are overwhelmingly in the form of [[noun]]s.{{sfn|Wheatley|2013}}

Historically, [[Pali]], the liturgical language of [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]], had a profound influence on Burmese vocabulary. Burmese has readily adopted words of Pali origin because of [[phonotactics|phonotactic]] similarities between two languages alongside the fact that the script used for Burmese can reproduce Pali spellings with complete accuracy.{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=64}} Pali [[loanword]]s are often related to religion, government, arts, and science.{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=64}}

Burmese loanwords from Pali primarily take four forms:
# Direct loan: direct import of Pali words with no alteration in orthography
#* "life": Pali {{lang|my|·Äá·ÄÆ·Äù}} ''[[jiva]]'' ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·Äá·ÄÆ·Äù}} ''jiva''
# Abbreviated loan: import of Pali words with accompanied syllable reduction and alteration in orthography (usually by means of a placing a diacritic, called ''[[virama|athat]]'' {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äû·Äê·Ä∫}} (lit. "nonexistence") atop the last letter in the syllable to suppress the consonant's inherent vowel{{sfn|UC|2012|p=370}}{{Full citation needed|date=May 2017}}
#* "[[karma]]": Pali {{lang|my|·ÄÄ'''·Äô·Äπ·Äô'''}} ''kam'''ma''''' ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Ä∂}} ''ka'''m'''''
#* "dawn": Pali {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äõ·ÄØ'''·Äè'''}} ''aru'''·πáa''''' ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äõ·ÄØ'''·Äè·Ä∫'''}} ''aru'''n'''''
#* "merit": Pali {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Äû'''·Äú'''}} ''kusa'''la''''' ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·ÄØ·Äû·Ä≠·ÄØ'''·Äú·Ä∫'''}} ''kusui'''l'''''
# Double loan: adoption of two [[Doublet (linguistics)|different terms]] derived from the same Pali word{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=64}}
#* Pali {{lang|my|·Äô·Ä¨·Äî}} ''mƒÅna'' ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·Äô·Ä¨·Äî}} {{IPA-my|m√†naÃ∞|}} "arrogance" and {{lang|my|·Äô·Ä¨·Äî·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|m√†…¥|}} "pride"
# Hybrid loan (e.g., [[neologism]]s or [[calque]]s): construction of [[Compound (linguistics)|compounds]] combining native Burmese words with Pali or combine Pali words:{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=65}}
#* "airplane": {{lang|my|·Äú·Ä±·Äö·Ä¨·Äâ·Ä∫·Äï·Äª·Ä∂}} {{IPA-my|l√® j…™ÃÄ…¥ bj√†…¥|}}, lit. "air machine fly", ‚Üê {{lang|my|·Äú·Ä±}} (native Burmese, "air") + {{lang|my|·Äö·Ä¨·Äâ·Ä∫}} (from Pali ''yana'', "vehicle") + {{lang|my|·Äï·Äª·Ä∂}} (native Burmese word, "fly"){{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=65}}

Burmese has also adapted a great deal of words from Mon, traditionally spoken by the [[Mon people]], who until recently formed the majority in [[Lower Burma]]. Most Mon loanwords are so well assimilated that they are not distinguished as loanwords as Burmese and Mon were used interchangeably for several centuries in pre-colonial Burma.{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999}} Mon loans are often related to flora, fauna, administration, textiles, foods, boats, crafts, architecture and music.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}}

As a natural consequence of [[British rule in Burma]], [[English language|English]] has been another major source of vocabulary, especially with regard to technology, measurements and modern institutions. English loanwords tend to take one of three forms:
# Direct loan: adoption of an English word, adapted to the Burmese phonology{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=81}}
#* "democracy": English ''democracy'' ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·Äí·ÄÆ·Äô·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Äõ·Ä±·ÄÖ·ÄÆ}}
# Neologism or calque: translation of an English word using native Burmese constituent words{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=67}}
#* "human rights": English "human rights" ‚Üí Burmese {{lang|my|·Äú·Ä∞·Ä∑·Ä°·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏}} ({{lang|my|·Äú·Ä∞·Ä∑}} "human" + {{lang|my|·Ä°·ÄÅ·ÄΩ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫·Ä°·Äõ·Ä±·Ä∏}} "rights")
# Hybrid loan: construction of compound words by native Burmese words to English words{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=94}}
#* "to sign": {{lang|my|·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äë·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|s ∞√°…™…¥ t ∞√≥|}} ‚Üê {{lang|my|·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏}} (English, "sign") + {{lang|my|·Äë·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏}} (native Burmese, "inscribe").

To a lesser extent, Burmese has also imported words from [[Sanskrit]] (religion), [[Hindi]] (food, administration, and shipping), and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (games and food).{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}} Burmese has also imported a handful of words from other European languages such as [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Here is a sample of loan words found in Burmese:
* suffering: {{lang|my|·Äí·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Äπ·ÄÅ}} {{IPA-my|do ä îk ∞aÃ∞|}}, from Pali ''[[dukkha]]''
* radio: {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä±·Äí·ÄÆ·Äö·Ä≠·ÄØ}} {{IPA-my|…π√®d√¨j√≤|}}, from [[English language|English]] "radio"
* method: {{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Äî·ÄÖ·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|s…ôn…™ î|}}, from Mon
* eggroll: {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·Äî·Ä∑·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|k…îÃÄpjaÃ∞…¥|}}, from [[Hokkien]] ÊΩ§È§Ö (j≈´n-pi√°‚Åø)
* wife: {{lang|my|·Äá·Äî·ÄÆ·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|z…ôn√≠|}}, from Hindi ''jani''
* noodle: {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Ä±·Ä´·ÄÄ·Ä∫·ÄÜ·ÄΩ·Ä≤}} {{IPA-my|k ∞a ä î s ∞w…õÃÅ|}}, from [[Shan language|Shan]] {{lang|my|·Å∂·Äù·Ä∫·Çà·Äû·ÄΩ·ÇÜ·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|k ∞ƒÅu s ∞…îi|}}
* foot (unit of measurement): {{lang|my|·Äï·Ä±}} {{IPA-my|p√®|}}, from Portuguese ''p√©''
* flag: {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äú·Ä∂}} {{IPA-my|…ôl√†…¥|}}, {{lang-ar|ÿπŸÑŸÖ}} '' øalam''
* storeroom: {{lang|my|·ÄÇ·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äí·Ä±·Ä´·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|…°√≤d√† ä…¥|}}, from [[Malay language|Malay]] ''gudang''

Since the end of British rule, the Burmese government has attempted to limit usage of Western loans (especially from English) by coining new words ([[neologism]]s). For instance, for the word "television," Burmese publications are mandated to use the term {{lang|my|·Äõ·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∂·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä¨·Ä∏}} (lit. "see picture, hear sound") in lieu of {{lang|my|·Äê·Äö·Ä∫·Äú·ÄÆ·Äó·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äõ·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏}}, a direct English transliteration.{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=68}} Another example is the word "vehicle", which is officially {{lang|my|·Äö·Ä¨·Äâ·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|j…™ÃÄ…¥|}} (derived from Pali) but {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Ä¨·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|k√°|}} (from English "car") in spoken Burmese. Some previously common English loanwords have fallen out of usage with the adoption of neologisms. An example is the word "university", formerly {{lang|my|·Äö·Ä∞·Äî·ÄÆ·Äó·Ä¨·ÄÖ·Äê·ÄÆ}} {{IPA-my|j√πn√¨b√†s…ôt√¨|}}, from English "university", now {{lang|my|·Äê·ÄÄ·Äπ·ÄÄ·Äû·Ä≠·ÄØ·Äú·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|te îk…ô√∞√≤|}}, a Pali-derived neologism recently created by the Burmese government and derived from the Pali spelling of [[Taxila]] ({{lang|my|·Äê·ÄÄ·Äπ·ÄÄ·Äû·ÄÆ·Äú}} ''Takkasila''), an ancient university town in modern-day Pakistan.{{sfn|Wheatley|Tun|1999|p=68}}

Some words in Burmese may have many synonyms, each having certain usages, such as formal, literary, colloquial, and poetic. One example is the word "moon", which can be {{lang|my|·Äú}} {{IPA|laÃ∞}} (native Tibeto-Burman), {{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Äî·Äπ·Äí·Ä¨/·ÄÖ·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|s√†…¥d√†]/[s√°…¥|}} (derivatives of Pali ''[[chandra|canda]]'' "moon"), or {{lang|my|·Äû·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äê·Ä¨}} {{IPA-my|Œ∏…îÃÄ d√†|}} (Sanskrit).{{sfn |MLC|1993}}

Phonetic notes:
:{{Note|1|1}}( ·Äû ), which was */s/ in Pali and OB, but was shifted forward by the shift of ( ·ÄÖ ) */ts/‚Üí/s/, is often transliterated as ‚ü®s‚ü© and transcribed /Œ∏/ in MSB but its actual pronunciation is closer to /…æÃ™ ∞~…æÃ™Œ∏~tŒ∏ÃÜ/, a dental flap, often accompanied by aspiration or a slight dental fricative, although it can also be voiced. It has a short release generated by moving the tongue back sharply from an interdental position, and will sound to English speakers like a short dental fricative combined with elements of a tap or stop. {{IPA|/√∞/|}} is the [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] [[allophone]] of ( ·Äû ) and is not itself a phoneme.
:{{Note|2|2}}/s ∞/ is a complex phoneme to define. It is a reflex of the earlier /t…ï ∞/ and then /ts ∞/ consonants. It is still distinguished from /s/ although it is not so much aspirated as pronounced breathy, and imparts a slight breathy quality to the following vowel making /sÃ§/ a more accurate, if more complex transcription.
:{{Note|3|3}}{{IPA|/…π/}} is rare, used only in [[Toponymy|toponyms]] and personal names that have retained [[Sanskrit]] or Pali pronunciations (such as [[Amarapura]], pronounced {{IPA-my|√†m…ô'''…π'''aÃ∞p√π'''…π'''aÃ∞|}} and in English-derived words. Historically, {{IPA|/…π/}} became {{IPA|/j/}} in Burmese, and is usually replaced by {{IPA|/j/}} in PƒÅli loanwords, e.g. "monk" {{lang|my|·Äõ·Äü·Äî·Äπ·Äê·Ä¨}} ''ra.hanta'' {{IPA-my|'''j'''…ôh√†…¥d√†|}}, "king" {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä¨·Äá}} ''raja.'' {{IPA-my|'''j'''√†zaÃ∞|}}. Occasionally it is replaced with {{IPA|/l/}} (e.g., "animal" {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä≠·Äõ·ÄÖ·Äπ·ÄÜ·Ä¨·Äî·Ä∫}} ''ti.rac hcan''), pronounced {{IPA-my|t…ô'''…π'''e…™ î s ∞√†…¥|}} or {{IPA-my|t…ô'''l'''e…™ î s ∞√†…¥|}}.
:{{Note|4|4}}{{IPA|/j/}} is often realised as [ ù], particularly word initially.
:{{Note|5|5}}{{IPA|/ ç/}} is rare, having disappeared from modern Burmese, except in transcriptions of foreign names and a handful of native words.

'''Medials and palatalisation'''

Burmese permits the palatalisation of certain letters. Besides [uÃØ], which is often erroneously treated as a medial [w] (see vowels), Burmese only permits the palatal medial. This is derived from Old Burmese */-j-/ */-l-/ and */-…π-/, and is, therefore, reflected in various ways in different dialects. In MSB orthography, two spellings exist for the medial (demonstrated on the consonant ·ÄÄ /k/), one reflecting an original /-j-/ (·ÄÄ·Äª - ky), and one an original /-…π-/ (·ÄÄ·Äº - kr). Official government romanistion still reflects this fact, as Myanmar, in official romanistion is rendered ''mran-ma''.

The letter for /l/ ( ·Äú ) is still pronounced as /l/ in initial position, but as a medial, it has completely merged with /-j-/ and /-…π-/. In OB inscriptions this medial could be rendered with a subscript or ‚Äústacked‚Äù ·Äú as in ( ·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äú ), a practice still used in the rare dialects, such as Tavoyan/Dawe where the /-l-/ medial is still pronounced distinctly. Although the palatalisation of the labials is simple /m p ∞ p b/ ‚Üí [m ≤ p√ß p ≤ b ≤], and the velar nasal predictably palatalises into a palatal nasal /≈ã/ ‚Üí [nÃ† ≤]. The palatalisation of /l/ leads, ostensibly to /l ≤/, however it often causes vowel raising or breaking, and may remain unchanged before /i/. The velar stops /k ∞ k g/ palatalise into /t…ï ∞ t…ï d ë/.

The alveolars /n t ∞ t d/ and historical palatals /nÃ† ≤ s ∞ s z/ cannot be followed by medials except in loan words, but even this is rare. Indeed, the letter *j ∞ ( ·Äà ) [z, s ∞] is almost indistinguishable from the s+y sequence ( ·ÄÖ·Äª ) and many combinations of alveolar+medial will render poorly in certain font sets which were not designed to handle non-native combined graphs.

'''The homorganic nasal and glottal stop'''

Only two consonants can occur word finally in native vocabulary:&lt;ref&gt;word final consonants in loans are omitted entirely in speech&lt;/ref&gt; the homorganic or placeless nasal, and the homorganic or glottal stop. These bear some similarities to the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[N (kana)|moraic n, „É≥]] and [[sokuon]] „Å£.

The glottal stop {{IPA|/ î/}} is the realisation of all four possible final consonants: ·Äï·Ä∫ /p/ ·Äê·Ä∫ /t/ ·ÄÖ·Ä∫ /s/ ·ÄÄ·Ä∫ /k/ and the retroflex ·Äã·Ä∫ / à/ found in loan words. It has the effect of shortening the vowel and precluding it from bearing tone. This itself is often referred to as the "checked" or "entering" tone, following Chinese nomenclature. It can be realised as a geminate of a following stop, although this is purely allophonic and optional as the difference between the sequence /V îtV/ and /VtÀêV/ is only in the catch, and thus barely audible. The primary indicator of this final is the impact on the vowel.

The final nasal /N/, (not to be confused with the standard IPA symbol /…¥/, see below), is the value of the four native final nasals: ·Äô·Ä∫ /m/ ·Äî·Ä∫ /n/ ·Äâ·Ä∫ /nÃ† ≤/ ·ÄÑ·Ä∫ /≈ã/ as well as the retroflex ·Äè /…≥/ and nasalisation mark [[anusvara]] demonstrated here above ka (·ÄÄ ‚Üí ·ÄÄ·Ä∂ ). It does not, however, apply to ·Ää·Ä∫ which is never realised as a nasal, but rather as an open front vowel [iÀê] [eÀê] or […õÀê].
The final nasal is usually realised as nasalisation of the vowel. It may also allophonically appear as a homorganic nasal before stops. For example in {{IPA|/m√≤ ä…¥d√°…™…¥/}} "storm", which is pronounced {{IPA-my|m√µÃÄ≈©nd√£ÃÅƒ©|}}.

It must be noted that the proper phonemic transcription is /N/, which is a non-standard, but widely used IPA symbol for a homorganic nasal, similarly to /Q/, the common symbol for a homorganic obstruent. There is an increasing tendency across many linguistic media (Wikipedia included) to substitute the IPA symbol […¥] (small majuscule n) which is the symbol for the [[uvular nasal]], a sound which does not exist in Burmese. This is largely due to the rarity of /…¥/ across languages and the fact that the use of a small majuscule makes transcription easier to read. Note that other languages with homorganic nasals, such as Japanese, also use intermittent /…¥/ in transcription. Nevertheless, the use of ‚ü®…¥‚ü© in Burmese transcription, though common and easy to read, is incorrect.

'''Series of stops'''

[[Burmese orthography]] is based on Brahmic script and can perfectly transcribe words from Pali, an Indic language. As a result, Burmese script uses far more symbols than Burmese needs for its phonemic inventory. Besides the set of retroflex consonants ·Äå / à ∞/ ·Äã / à/ ·Äç /…ñ/ ·Äé /…ñ ∞/ ·Äè /…≥/ ·Ä† /…≠/ which are pronounced as alveolar in Burmese, All stops come in sets of four: voiceless aspirated, voiceless, voiced, and voiced aspirated or murmured. The first set ·Äñ /p ∞/ ·Äë /t ∞/ ·ÄÜ /s ∞/ ·ÄÅ /k ∞/ and second set ·Äï /p/ ·Äê /t/ ·ÄÖ /s/ ·ÄÄ /k/ are commonly used in Burmese. The voiced set ·Äó /b/ ·Äí /d/ ·Äá /z/ ·ÄÇ /g/ are used in Burmese but sparingly. They are frequently seen in loans from Pali. It may be possible to say that they exist only in loans, however some of the words they appear in are so old and deeply integrated into the language that the three-way voicing/aspiration distinction can still be said to be an important part of the language. The final set ·Äò /b ∞/ ·Äì /d ∞/ ·Äà /z ∞/ ·ÄÉ /g ∞/ are exceedingly rare. They are generally pronounced as voiced [b d z g] or, when following a syllable final stop, aspirated [p ∞ t ∞ s ∞ k ∞]. The most common by far is ·Äò used in the negative indicative verb particle ·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏ ''bh√∫'' [b√∫Àê] or [p ∞√∫Àê], and also in some common loans such as ·Äú·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äò·ÄÄ·Ä∫ ''lekbhek'' [l…õÃÜ î p ∞…õÃÜ î] (tea), although many Pali loans with complex spellings are being simplified in common usage, leaving the phonetic rendering ·Äú·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äñ·ÄÄ·Ä∫ in some tea houses.

'''Burmese voicing sandhi'''

Burmese exhibits voicing [[sandhi]]. Traditionally, Burmese has voiced voiceless unaspirated stops into voiced stops, which at first, was allophonic. However, due to the influx of phonemeic voiced stops from loan words, and owing to the extension of sandhi to voiceless aspirated stops as well ‚Äì a feature which does not affect more conservative dialects ‚Äì sandhi has become an important part of Burmese phonology and word building. In brief, the following shifts can occur in MSB:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*{{IPA|/k ∞, k/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|/…°/}}
*{{IPA|/t…ï ∞, t…ï/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|/d ë/}}
*{{IPA|/s ∞, s/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|/z/}}
*{{IPA|/t ∞, t/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|/d/}}
*{{IPA|/p ∞, p/}} ‚Üí {{IPA|/b/}}
}}
Additionally ( ·Äû ) can become voiced under the same conditions, however this is purely allophonic since the voiced […æÃ™~√∞ÃÜ~dÃ™ÃÜ] phone does not exist in any other context.

Sandhi can occur in two environments. In the first environment, consonants become voiced between vowels or after nasals. This is similar to rendaku in Japanese.{{sfn|Nishi|30 October 1998|p=253-260}} This Therefore can affect any consonant except the first consonant of the phrase or a consonant preceded by a stop.
:e.g. "hot water": {{IPA-my|j√®'''b'''√π|}} {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä±·Äï·Ä∞}} ‚Üê {{IPA|/j√®/}} + {{IPA|/'''p'''√π/}}

The second environment occurs around reduced syllables (see reduction for more). When a syllable becomes reduced, the vowel and any final consonants are reduced to a short schwa […ôÃÜ]. Reduction cannot occur in the final syllable of a word. When a syllable becomes reduced, if ''both'' the consonant preceding and following the schwa ‚Äì i.e. the consonant of the reduced syllable and the consonant of the following syllable ‚Äì are stops, then both will be voiced:{{sfn|Nishi|30 October 1998|p=253-260}}
:e.g. "promise": {{IPA-my|'''…°'''…ô'''d'''·∏≠|}} {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äê·Ä≠}} ‚Üê {{IPA|/'''k'''aÃ∞/}} + {{IPA|/'''t'''·∏≠/}}

In some compound works, the phoneme {{IPA|/d ë/}}, when following the nasalized final {{IPA|/…¥/}}, can shift to a {{IPA|/j/}} sound:
:e.g. "blouse" ({{lang|my|·Ä°·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äπ·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄÆ}} ''angkyi''): {{IPA-my|√®…™…¥'''d ë'''√≠|}} ‚Üí {{IPA-my|√®…™…¥'''j'''√≠|}}.

The phonemes {{IPA|/p, p ∞, b, t, t ∞, d/}}, when following the nasalized final {{IPA|/…¥/}}, can become {{IPA|/m/}} in compound words:
:e.g. "to consult" {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄÑ·Ä∫}}: {{IPA-my|t√†…™…¥ '''p'''…™ÃÄ…¥|}} ‚Üí {{IPA-my|t√†…™…¥ '''m'''…™ÃÄ…¥|}}
:e.g. "to apologize" {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Äî·Ä∫}}: {{IPA-my|t√° ä…¥ '''p'''√†…¥|}} ‚Üí {{IPA-my|t√° ä…¥ '''m'''√†…¥|}}
:e.g. "airplane" {{lang|my|·Äú·Ä±·Äö·Ä¨·Äâ·Ä∫·Äï·Äª·Ä∂}}: {{IPA-my|l√®i j…™ÃÄ…¥ '''p'''j√†…¥|}} ‚Üí {{IPA-my|l√®…™…¥ '''m'''j√†…¥|}}

'''Aspiration and devoicing'''

Although Burmese natively contrasts unaspirated and aspirated stops, there is an additional devoicing/aspirating feature. In OB, ''h-'' or a syllable beginning with /h/ could be prefixed to roots, merging over time with the consonant of the following syllable. In the case of the unaspirated stops, these are replaced with the aspirated letter, however words beginning with ·Äô /m/ ·Äî /n/ ·Ää /nÃ† ≤/ ·ÄÑ /≈ã/ ·Äú /l/ ·Äõ /j/ ·Äö /j/ ·Äù /w/ use a subscript diacritic called ''ha-to'' to indicate devoicing: ·Äô·Äæ ·Äî·Äæ ·Ää·Äæ ·ÄÑ·Äæ ·Äú·Äæ ·Äõ·Äæ ·Äö·Äæ ·Äù·Äæ /mÃ• nÃ• nÃ†Ãä ≤ ≈ãÃä lÃ• …ï …ï  ç/, although as noted above, [ ç] is incredibly rare. Devoicing in Burmese is not strong, particularly not on nasals. The sequence /nÃ•a/ is pronounced closer to [nÃ§aÃ§] than [nÃ•na].

In many Burmese verbs, [[Aspirated consonant|pre-aspiration and post-aspiration]] distinguishes the [[causative]] and non-causative forms of verbs, where the aspirated initial consonant indicates [[active voice]] or a [[transitive verb]], while an unaspirated initial consonant indicates [[Voice (grammar)|passive voice]] or an [[intransitive verb]]:{{sfn|Yanson|2012|p=17}}
:e.g. "to cook" {{IPA-my|'''t…ï ∞'''…õ î|}}, {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Äª·ÄÄ·Ä∫}} vs. "to be cooked" {{IPA-my|'''t…ï'''…õ î|}}, {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄÄ·Ä∫}}
:e.g. "to loosen" {{IPA-my|'''p ∞'''j√®|}}, {{lang|my|·Äñ·Äº·Ä±}} vs. "to be loosened" {{IPA-my|'''p'''j√®|}},  {{lang|my|·Äï·Äº·Ä±}}
:e.g. "to elevate" {{IPA-my|'''mÃ•'''j…™…¥|}}, {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫}} vs. "to be elevated" {{IPA-my|'''m'''j…™…¥|}}, {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫}}

The monophthongs {{IPA|/e/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/…ô/}}, and {{IPA|/…î/}} occur only in open syllables (those without a [[syllable coda]]); the diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}}, {{IPA|/ou/}}, {{IPA|/ai/}}, and {{IPA|/au/}} occur only in closed syllables (those with a syllable coda). {{IPA|/…ô/}} only occurs in a minor syllable, and is the only vowel that is permitted in a minor syllable (see below).

The close vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} and the close portions of the diphthongs are somewhat mid-centralized ({{IPA|[…™,  ä]}}) in closed syllables, i.e. before {{IPA|/…¥/}} and {{IPA|/ î/}}. Thus {{lang|my|·Äî·Äæ·ÄÖ·Ä∫}} {{IPA|/nÃ•i î/}} "two" is phonetically {{IPA|[nÃ•…™ î]}} and {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} {{IPA|/t…ï√†u…¥/}} "cat" is phonetically {{IPA|[t…ï√† ä…¥]}}.

Although this analysis is (more or less) correct from a purely phonetic point of view, it hides the diachronic nature of Burmese vowel development and mergers, and obfuscates the reasoning behind Burmese orthography.

====Vowels in open syllables====

Synchronically, there can be said to be a total of 10 vowels in Modern Standard Burmese (MSB) open syllables: /a/ /uÃØa/ /…õ/ /uÃØ…õ/ /e/ /uÃØe/ /i/ /…î/ /o/ /u/. Although the vowels /uÃØa/ /uÃØ…õ/ /uÃØe/ are commonly treated as medial-vowel sequences, reducing the vowel inventory of MSB in open syllables from 10 to 7, the behaviour of /uÃØa/ /uÃØ…õ/ /uÃØe/ is unlike that of glide-vowel combinations. See the section on glides below for a more complete explanation.

Diachronically, however, all of the MSB open syllable vowels are derived from Old Burmese (OB) open syllables or diphthongs. The four vowels of OB were */a/ */i/ */o/ */u/. Early in the development of Burmese */o/ broke to form */uÃØa/. Additionally, any vowel could be followed by either of two glides: */j/ and */w/. The diphthongs which result from these glides were considered to be closed syllables in OB and as such, could not be followed by any other consonant. However, in MSB, all OB diphthongs have become monophthongs and are thus phonetically viewed as open syllables. As a result, the vowels /…õ/ /uÃØ…õ/ /e/ /uÃØe/ /…î/ /o/ can only exist in open syllables in MSB (with some rare exceptions), and the use of these sounds in closed syllables is the result of */a/ */i/ */uÃØa/ */u/ shifting before a final.

The /j/ offglide results in the e-class vowels */aj/‚Üí/…õ/, */ij/‚Üí/e/, */uÃØaj/‚Üí/uÃØ…õ/, */uj/‚Üí/uÃØe/ respectively. Note the symmetry with the base vowel system: The closed vowels */i/ and */u/ create the mid-closed vowels /e/ and /uÃØe/ while */a/ and */o/ create the mid-open vowels /…õ/ and /uÃØ…õ/. Similarly, the rounded on-glide is a result of a rounded base vowel */u/ or */o/.

Currently, the /w/ offglide is only believed to have existed in */aw/ and */uw/ resulting in the MSB o-class vowels /…î/ and /o/ respectively. The absence of */iw/ and */ow/ in reconstructions is something of a mystery, however it is possible that, by analogy with the /j/ offglide, */aw/ */iw/ */ow/ */uw/ all existed, resulting in pairs with or without the rounded on-glide: /…î/ /o/ /uÃØ…î/ /uÃØo/ which later merged. This may explain why the Burmese orthography indicates the vowel /o/ with both the diacritics for both the /i/ and /u/ vowels and, previously, a following consonantal /w/.

====Finals====

MSB recognises 8 finals in native vocabulary which are all distinguished from their initial forms with the c-shaped superscript diacritic ''asat'' ( ·Ä∫ ) which for ease of reading, is omitted here: the stops: ·Äï /p/ ·Äê /t/ ·ÄÖ /c/&lt;ref&gt;Note that ( ·ÄÖ ), here labeled ‚Äúpalatal‚Äù and transcribed as ''-c'' is pronounced /s/ initially in MSB but it is attested as an affricate /ts/ as recently as the 1800's and in earlier stages was likely /t É~t…ï/ and before that /c/, mimicking the development of Latin ‚ü®C‚ü© in the daughter Romance languages / k &gt; c &gt; t É (&gt; ts &gt; s (&gt; Œ∏)) /.&lt;/ref&gt; ·ÄÄ /k/ and the nasals: ·Äô /m/ ·Äî /n/ ·Ää / ·Äâ /…≤/&lt;ref&gt;( ·Ää )and ( ·Äâ ) behave much the same, except that ( ·Ää ) is not itself pronounced, and has a broader range of effects on the vowel. It is indistinguishable from open syllable words. ( ·Äâ ) on the other hand nasalises the vowel like the other nasal finals and usually only has a single realisation.&lt;/ref&gt; ·ÄÑ /≈ã/. All of the stops in final position are realised as a glottal stop / î/ (or, potentially, a geminate of a following stop) which shortens the vowel and precludes it from bearing any tone.&lt;ref&gt;this is itself sometimes referred to as the ‚Äúchecked tone‚Äù or ‚Äúentering tone‚Äù following Chinese nomenclature&lt;/ref&gt; All of the nasals on the other hand nasalise the vowel but are not pronounced as consonants unless there is a following nasal or stop. Syllables ending on nasals can bear any of the three tones, but rarely have tone 1 (short, high, creaky phonation).

Finals are broadly grouped into two sets: front and back finals. Front finals include the labial and alveolar finals ''-m'' ''-n'' and ''-p'' ''-t'' which are not distinguished in MSB, leading to mergers such as ·Ä°·Ä≠·Äï·Äπ (*/ip/ sleep) and ·Ä°·Ä≠·Äê·Äπ (*/it/ bag), both pronounced [ƒï…™ î]. In Tavoyan dialects however, the labial finals ''-m'' and ''-p'' often cause vowel breaking (*/un/ -&gt; /≈©Àê/, */um/ -&gt; /√£ ä/). The back finals include the palatal finals ''-c'' ''-…≤'' and velar ''-k'' ''-≈ã'', although their uses are even more complex.

Current reconstruction holds that the OB vowel-offglide sequences ‚Äì which today are /…õ/ /uÃØ…õ/ /e/ /uÃØe/ /…î/ /o/ in MSB ‚Äì counted as a closed syllables and thus could not be followed by a final. As a result, most closed syllables in MSB are built around the 4 basic vowels /a/ /i/ /uÃØa/ /u/.

====Finals in loans====

In loan words, usually from Pali, ·Äú /l/ ·Äõ /…π~j/ ·Äù /w/ ·Äû /s/&lt;ref&gt;( ·Äû ), which was */s/ in Pali and OB, but was shifted forward by the shift of ( ·ÄÖ ) */ts/‚Üí/s/, is often transliterated as ‚ü®s‚ü© and transcribed /Œ∏/ in MSB but its actual pronunciation is closer to /…æÃ™ ∞~…æÃ™Œ∏~tŒ∏ÃÜ/, a dental flap, often accompanied by aspiration or a slight dental fricative, although it can also be voiced. It has a short release generated by moving the tongue back sharply from an interdental position, and will sound to English speakers like a short dental fricative combined with elements of a tap or stop&lt;/ref&gt; are found but are silent and do not affect the vowel, which continues to behave as an open syllable vowel. Also from Pali are the retroflex finals ·Äã / à/ and ·Äè /…≥/ which merge with their alveolar counterparts, as does the superscript diacritic ( ·Ä∂ ) anusvara which is a pan-Brahmic nasalisation mark functioning as a final -m or -n in MSB distinguished only by the fact that it bears tone 1 (short, high, creaky) by default, and can be modified to bear tone 3 (long, high / high falling, breathy), but cannot bear tone 2 (long, low / low rising). Other nasal syllables, by contrast, bear tone 2 by default, and must be modified to bear tones 1 or 3. The consonant ( ·Äö ) is also seen with an ''asat'' diacritic, but this is the standard spelling for the vowel /…õ/ with tone 2 and is not viewed in any way as a final (although, as noted above, this is an etymologically accurate rendering of /…õ/ which originated from the */aj/ sequence). Finally, Pali loan words, as well as loans from English or Chinese, may add a final after the vowel /e/. An example of this is the commonly displayed Pali word ·Äô·Ä±·Äê·Äπ·Äê·Ä¨ [[mettƒÅ]], from Sanskrit  ‡§Æ‡•à‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ''maitra'', a Buddhist notion of sharing good will and positive wishes. This is exclusively used to transcribe an /e/ vowel in closed syllables in loans, but cannot occur in native vocabulary, although many such loans, particularly from Pali, may be centuries old.

====Vowels before front finals====

The 4 basic vowels /a/ /i/ /uÃØa/ /u/ can all occur before the front finals. In MSB before the ''-p'' and ''-t'' finals they are pronounced /√¶ÃÜ î/ /ƒï…™ î/ /uÃØ√¶ÃÜ î~ äÃÜ î/ /≈è ä î/ respectively. Similarly, before the ''-m'' and ''-n'' finals, vowels use the same qualities except that they are nasalised and are pronounced long by default&lt;ref&gt;Although Burmese vowel diacritics all have different default tones, the four vowels used before front finals all imply a short tone (tone 1) by default, which is promoted to tone 2, the long low and level or slightly rising tone before a nasal final.&lt;/ref&gt; thus giving: /√¶ÃÉÀê/ /·∫Ω…™Àê/ /uÃØ√¶ÃÉÀê~ äÃÉÀê/ /√µ äÀê/.

The variation between / äÃÜ î/ / äÃÉÀê/ and /uÃØ√¶ÃÜ î/ /uÃØ√¶ÃÉÀê/ is regional. North-central dialects in and around Mandalay tend to use the original opening diphthong while southern dialects in and around Yangon tend to use the monophthong. Both pronunciations are universally accepted and understood. In more conservative dialects /i/ /u/ and */o/ may not break, and thus remain /ƒ≠ î/ /ƒ©/, /≈≠ î/ /≈©/, and /…îÃÜ î/ /…îÃÉ/, additionally */an/ may move back, not forward, leaving /…îÃÉ/ and not /√¶ÃÉ/, but all of these features are considered non-standard.

====Vowels before back finals====

The finals ( ·Ää / ·Äâ ) originally */…≤/ in OB, can only occur after the vowel /a/ and are highly variable in pronunciation. Across Burmese dialects ( ·Ää ) does not nasalise the vowel, and tends to result in an open syllable monophthong, often with multiple possible realisations. ( ·Äâ ) on the other hand nasalises the vowel and tends to have a more conservative pronunciation.
As the original final was realised */a…≤/ in OB, the vowel underwent a shift /a…≤ &gt; aj…≤ &gt; ajn &gt; a…™n (&gt; √£…™ &gt; …õ/e/i)/. The pronunciation of ( ·Äâ ) tends to be /a…™n~√£…™/ in the Rakhine/Arakanese dialects, but /in~ƒ©Àê/ in other dialects, including MSB and the conservative Tavoyan/Dawe dialect.
In MSB ( ·Ää ) is most commonly pronounced /…õÀê/, following the shift of */aj/ &gt; /…õÀê/ in open syllables, although it can be /iÀê/ and less often /eÀê/. Tavoyan dialects restrict the pronunciation to /…õÀê/ exclusively, while Rakhine dialects use /eÀê/.&lt;ref&gt;Note that vowel length and tone are intertwined and can be modified with diacritics. The transcription here with long vowels is representative only of the default value of the vowel with a nasal final.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final ( ·ÄÖ ) shows a lot of similarities to the development of ( ·Äâ ). It similarly exists only after the vowel /a/. In MSB and Tavoyan dialects it is pronounced as /…™ÃÜ î/, but Rakhine dialects preserve it as /ƒÉ…™ î/ following the same shift /ac &gt; ajc &gt; a…™c &gt; a…™ î (&gt; i î)/.

The velar finals ( ·ÄÄ ) and ( ·ÄÑ ) can follow the vowels /a/ and /uÃØa/ and, unusually, /…î/ and /o/. In MSB /a/ and /uÃØa/ become /…õÃÜ î/ /uÃØ…õÃÜ î/ and /…™ÃÉÀê/ /uÃØƒ©Àê/ with the stop and nasal finals respectively. This is, it must be said, a distinctive feature of MSB however, as the Rakhine dialects shift the /a/ back to become /…îÃÜ î/ /…îÃÉÀê/, and Tavoyan dialects merge the ''-ak'' ''-a≈ã'' rimes with the ''-at'' ''-an'' and ''-ap'' ''-am'' rimes, allegedly resulting in /ƒÉ î/ /√£Àê/, although it is unclear whether these are truly [a] or [√¶] as in MSB.

The rimes */…îk/ (·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫) */…î≈ã/ (·Ä°·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫) are somewhat problematic from a linguistic perspective. Despite the fact that these rimes are written with the same compound vowel diacritics which indicate the open syllable /…î/, as noted above, the rime */aw/ is viewed by linguists to have been a closed syllable and thus, it is assumed that the */aw/ vowel which resulted in MSB /…î/ is distinct from the vowel in the rimes */…îk/ */…î≈ã/ which either did not exist in open syllables, or merged completely with a vowel which did. Whatever the etymology, in MSB the rimes */…îk/ */…î≈ã/ are realised as /ƒÉ ä î/ /√£ ä/, and realised /…îÃÜ î/ /…îÃÉÀê/ in Tavoyan.

The rimes */ok/ (·Ä°·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫) */o≈ã/ (·Ä°·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫), written with the compound vowel diacritic for /o/ are pronounced /ƒÉ…™ î/ and /√£…™/ respectively and are currently believed to have been innovations in Burmese, and as such their shared orthography with the /o/ vowel is coincidental.

====The closed syllable vowel inventory====

Just as open syllables have ten vowels, so too do closed syllables: /√¶/ /…™/ /…õ/ /uÃØ√¶~ ä/ /uÃØ…õ/ /uÃØ…™/ /e…™/ /o ä/ /a…™/ /a ä/. It is worth noting that in Yangon MSB no vowel quality exists in both closed and open syllables, and that therefore nasalisation cannot be said to be a contrastive feature in and of itself.

====Notes on glides====

Note that, the vocalic onglide /uÃØ/ is usually transcribed both in phonetic transcription and in romanisation as /w/. This is due to the fact that, phonetically, it behaves as a medial, however, here the transcription /uÃØ/ is used to emphasise that it is a part of the vowel and not a true medial like /-j-/ (romanised -y-). /-j-/ is derived from OB */-j-/ */-l-/ and */-…π-/, and is, therefore, reflected in various ways in different dialects. In MSB orthography two spellings exist for the medial (demonstrated on the consonant ·ÄÄ /k/), one reflecting an original /-j-/ (·ÄÄ·Äª - ky), and one an original /-…π-/ (·ÄÄ·Äº - kr) and official government romanistion still reflects this fact (Myanmar, in official romanistion is rendered ''mran-ma''). However, in MSB, */…π/, for which there is also a unique initial letter ( ·Äõ ), is pronounced /j/ in all instances (usually realised as [ ù] initially) except in loan words.
The letter for /l/ ( ·Äú ) is still pronounced as /l/ in initial position, but as a medial, it has completely merged with /-j-/ and /-…π-/. In OB inscriptions this medial could be rendered with a subscript or ‚Äústacked‚Äù ·Äú as in ( ·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äú ), a practice still used in the rare dialects, such as Tavoyan/Dawe where the /-l-/ medial is still pronounced distinctly.
These medials behave differently than the /uÃØ/ onglide in the following ways:

* a medial */-j-/ */-l-/ */-…π-/ can be placed before the on-glide /uÃØ/, whereas two medials can never be used in the same syllable.
* the use of /uÃØ/ is restricted by the vowel nucleus (only used with /a/ /…õ/ /e/) and may in some cases drastically change the pronunciation of the vowel e.g. in Yangon /wa/ before a final becomes [u], while /a/ before a final becomes [√¶]. However, it cannot affect the pronunciation of the initial.
* glides are restricted by the preceding initial, and often change its pronunciation. Bearing in mind that MSB does not reliably indicate the development of */-l-/, /m/ /p ∞/ /p/ /b/ can apparently be followed by any glide, in which case the glide becomes [ ≤]. Similarly /k ∞/ /k/ and /g/ can be followed by any glide, in which case the cluster becomes [t…ï ∞] [t…ï] or [d ë] respectively. /≈ã/ can be followed by /-…π-/ but not /-j-/ in which case the cluster becomes […≤], merging with the palatal nasal letter ( ·Ää / ·Äâ ). And finally, /l/ can be followed by /-j-/ but not /-…π-/. It should be noted that this is rare and in Yangon MSB this represents the only case where the medial impacts the vowel, whereby the sequence ·Äú·Äª·Ä¨ */ljaÀê/ is realised [leaÃØ]. Tavoyan front vowels are frequently raised following /-j-/.
There is, at least in Yangon MSB, no difference between an initial /j/ /…π/ /w/ and a null initial with /-j-/ /-…π-/ /uÃØ/. This extends to a /w/ initial followed by a  /uÃØ/ onglide. Therefore, in Yangon (and likely much of MSB) /wa/, /√òuÃØa/, and /wuÃØa/ are pronounced identically.

=== Tones ===
Burmese is a [[tonal language]], which means [[phoneme|phonemic]] contrasts can be made on the basis of the [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] of a vowel. In Burmese, these contrasts involve not only [[pitch (music)|pitch]], but also [[phonation]], intensity (loudness), duration, and vowel quality. However, some linguists consider Burmese a [[Register (phonology)|pitch-register language]] like [[Shanghainese]].{{sfn|Jones|1986|p=135-136}}

There are four contrastive tones in Burmese. In the following table, the tones are shown marked on the vowel {{IPA|/a/}} as an example.
{|class="wikitable"
! Tone || Burmese || Symbol&lt;br /&gt;(shown on ''a'') || Phonation || Duration || Intensity || Pitch
|-
| Low || {{lang|my|·Äî·Ä≠·Äô·Ä∑·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∂}} || {{IPA|√†}} || normal || medium || low || low, often slightly rising{{sfn|Wheatley|1987}}
|-
| High || {{lang|my|·Äê·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∂}} || {{IPA|√°}} || sometimes slightly [[breathy voice|breathy]] || long || high || high, often with a fall before a pause{{sfn|Wheatley|1987}}
|-
| Creaky || {{lang|my|·Äû·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∂}} || {{IPA|aÃ∞}} || [[tenseness|tense]] or [[creaky voice|creaky]], sometimes with lax [[glottal stop]] || medium || high || high, often slightly falling{{sfn|Wheatley|1987}}
|-
| Checked || {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äû·Ä∂}} || {{IPA|a î}} || centralized vowel quality, final glottal stop || short || high || high (in [[citation form|citation]]; can vary in context){{sfn|Wheatley|1987}}
|}

For example, the following words are distinguished from each other only on the basis of tone:
* Low ·ÄÅ·Ä´ {{IPA|/k ∞'''√†'''/}} "shake"
* High ·ÄÅ·Ä´·Ä∏ {{IPA|/k ∞'''√°'''/}} "be bitter"
* Creaky ·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·Ä∏ {{IPA|/k ∞'''aÃ∞'''/}} "fee"
* Checked {{IPA|/k ∞'''a î'''/}} "draw off"

In syllables ending with {{IPA|/…¥/}}, the checked tone is excluded:
* Low {{IPA|/k ∞'''√†'''…¥/}} "undergo"
* High {{IPA|/k ∞'''√°'''…¥/}} "dry up"
* Creaky {{IPA|/k ∞'''aÃ∞'''…¥/}} "appoint"

In spoken Burmese, some linguists classify two real tones (there are four nominal tones transcribed in written Burmese), "high" (applied to words that terminate with a stop or check, high-rising pitch) and "ordinary" (unchecked and non-glottal words, with falling or lower pitch), with those tones encompassing a variety of pitches.{{sfn|Taylor|1920|p=91‚Äì106}} The "ordinary" tone consists of a range of pitches. Linguist L. F. Taylor concluded that "conversational rhythm and euphonic intonation possess importance" not found in related tonal languages and that "its tonal system is now in an advanced state of decay."{{sfn|Taylor|1920}}{{sfn|Benedict|1948|p=184‚Äì191}}

=== Syllable structure ===
The [[syllable]] structure of Burmese is C(G)V((V)C), which is to say the [[syllable onset|onset]] consists of a consonant optionally followed by a [[semivowel|glide]], and the [[syllable rime|rime]] consists of a monophthong alone, a monophthong with a consonant, or a diphthong with a consonant. The only consonants that can stand in the [[syllable coda|coda]] are {{IPA|/ î/}} and {{IPA|/…¥/}}. Some representative words are:
* CV {{IPA|/m√®/}} 'girl'
* CVC {{IPA|/m…õ î/}} 'crave'
* CGV {{IPA|/mj√®/}} 'earth'
* CGVC {{IPA|/mj…õ î/}} 'eye'
* CVVC {{IPA|/m√† ä…¥/}} (term of address for young men)
* CGVVC {{IPA|/mj√° ä…¥/}} 'ditch'

A [[minor syllable]] has some restrictions:
* It contains {{IPA|/…ô/}} as its only vowel
* It must be an open syllable (no coda consonant)
* It cannot bear tone
* It has only a simple (C) onset (no glide after the consonant)
* It must not be the final syllable of the word

Some examples of words containing minor syllables:
* {{IPA|/k ∞…ô.lo ä î/}} 'knob'
* {{IPA|/p…ô.lw√®/}} 'flute'
* {{IPA|/Œ∏…ô.j…îÃÄ/}} 'mock'
* {{IPA|/k…ô.l…õ î/}} 'be wanton'
* {{IPA|/t ∞…ô.m…ô.j√®/}} 'rice-water'

== Alphabet ==
{{Main|Burmese alphabet}}
[[File:Vendeurs de plantes m√©dicinales vers Kyaiktiyo Paya.jpg|thumb|Sampling of various Burmese script styles]]

The Burmese alphabet consists of 33 letters and 12 vowels, and is written from left to right. It requires no spaces between words, although modern writing usually contains spaces after each clause to enhance readability. Characterized by its circular letters and diacritics, the script is an [[abugida]], with all letters having an inherent vowel {{lang|my|·Ä°}} ''a.'' {{IPA-my|aÃ∞|}} or {{IPA-my|…ô|}}. The consonants are arranged into [[Burmese alphabet#Arrangement|six consonant groups]] (called {{lang|my|·Äù·ÄÇ·Ä∫}} based on articulation, like other Brahmi scripts. Tone markings and vowel modifications are written as diacritics placed to the left, right, top, and bottom of letters.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}}

The development of the script followed that of the language, which is generally divided into Old Burmese, Middle Burmese and modern Burmese. Old Burmese dates from the 11th to the 16th century ([[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]] and [[Ava Kingdom|Ava]] dynasties); Middle Burmese from the 16th to the 18th century ([[Taungoo Dynasty|Toungoo]] to early [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] dynasties); modern Burmese from the mid-18th century to the present. Orthographic changes followed shifts in phonology (such as the merging of the {{IPA|[-l-]}} and {{IPA|[-…π-]}} medials) rather than transformations in Burmese grammatical structure and phonology, which has not changed much from Old Burmese to modern Burmese.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}} For example, during the Pagan era, the medial {{IPA|[-l-]}} {{lang|my|·Äπ·Äú}} was transcribed in writing, which has been replaced by medials {{IPA|[-j-]}} {{lang|my|·Äª}} and {{IPA|[-…π-]}} {{lang|my|·Äº}} in modern Burmese (e.g. "school" in old Burmese {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äπ·Äú·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|kl…î≈ã|}} ‚Üí {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|t…ï√° ä…¥|}} in modern Burmese).{{sfn|Khin Min|1987}} Likewise written Burmese has preserved all nasalized finals {{IPA|[-n, -m, -≈ã]}}, which have merged to {{IPA|[-…¥]}} in spoken Burmese. (The exception is {{IPA|[-…≤]}}, which, in spoken Burmese, can be one of many open vowels {{IPA|[i, e, …õ]}}. Likewise, other consonantal finals {{IPA|[-s, -p, -t, -k]}} have been reduced to {{IPA|[- î]}}. Similar mergers are seen in other Sino-Tibetan languages like [[Shanghainese#Rimes|Shanghainese]], and to a lesser extent, [[Standard Cantonese#Current Shifts|Cantonese]].)

Written Burmese dates to the [[Pagan Kingdom#Early Pagan|early Pagan period]]. The [[British rule in Burma|British colonial period]] scholars believed that the Burmese script was developed c. 1058 from the [[Mon script]].{{sfn|Harvey|1925|p=307}} However, evidence shows that the Burmese script has been in use at least since 1035 (perhaps as early as 984) while the earliest Burma Mon script, which is different from the Thailand Mon script, dates to 1093.{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|2005|p=167‚Äì178, 197‚Äì200}} The Burmese script may have been sourced from the [[Pyu script]].{{sfn|Aung-Thwin|2005|p=167‚Äì178, 197‚Äì200}} (Both Mon and Pyu scripts are derivatives of the [[Brahmi script]].) Burmese orthography originally followed a square format but the cursive format took hold from the 17th century when popular writing led to the wider use of palm leaves and folded paper known as ''parabaiks'' {{lang|my|·Äï·ÄØ·Äõ·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÄ·Ä∫}}.{{sfn|Lieberman|2003|p=136}} Much of the orthography in written Burmese today can be traced back to Middle Burmese. Standardized tone marking was not achieved until the 18th century. From the 19th century onward, orthographers created spellers to reform Burmese spelling, because ambiguities arose over spelling sounds that had been merged.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}} During British colonial rule, Burmese spelling was standardized through dictionaries and spellers. The latest spelling authority, named the ''Myanma Salonpaung Thatpon Kyan'' {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨ ·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Äú·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏·Äï·Ä±·Ä´·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏ ·Äû·Äê·Ä∫·Äï·ÄØ·Ä∂ ·ÄÄ·Äª·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏}}, was compiled in 1978 at the request of the Burmese government.{{sfn|Herbert|Milner|1989}}

== Grammar ==
The basic [[word order]] of the Burmese language is [[subject (grammar)|subject]]-[[object (grammar)|object]]-[[verb]]. Pronouns in Burmese vary according to the gender and status of the audience. Burmese is [[monosyllabic]] (i.e., every word is a root to which a particle but not another word may be prefixed).{{sfn|Taw Sein Ko|1924|p=viii}} Sentence structure determines syntactical relations and verbs are not conjugated. Instead they have particles suffixed to them. For example, the verb "to eat," {{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''ca:'' {{IPA-my|s√†|}} is itself unchanged when modified.

=== Adjectives ===
Burmese does not have [[adjective]]s per se. Rather, it has verbs that carry the meaning "to be X", where X is an English adjective. These verbs can modify a noun by means of the grammatical particle {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑}} ''tai.'' {{IPA-my|d…õÃ∞|}} in colloquial Burmese (literary form: {{lang|my|·Äû·Ä±·Ä¨}} ''sau:'' {{IPA-my|Œ∏…îÃÅ|}}, which is suffixed as follows:
:Colloquial: {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·Äê·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äú·Ä∞}} ''hkyau: tai. lu'' {{IPA-my|t…ï ∞…îÃÅ d…õÃ∞ l√π|}}
:Formal: {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨·Äû·Ä±·Ä¨·Äú·Ä∞}} ''hkyau: so: lu''
:Gloss: "beautiful" + adjective particle + "person"

Adjectives may also form a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] with the noun (e.g. {{lang|my|·Äú·Ä∞·ÄÅ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨}} ''lu hkyau:'' {{IPA-my|l√π t…ï ∞…îÃÅ|}} "person" + "be beautiful").

[[Comparative]]s are usually ordered: X + {{lang|my|·Äë·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äï·Ä≠·ÄØ}} ''htak pui'' {{IPA-my|t ∞e î p√≤|}} + adjective, where X is the object being compared to. [[Superlative]]s are indicated with the prefix {{lang|my|·Ä°}} ''a.'' {{IPA-my| î…ô|}} + adjective + {{lang|my|·ÄÜ·ÄØ·Ä∂·Ä∏}} ''hcum:'' {{IPA-my|z√≥ ä…¥|}}.

Numerals follow the nouns they modify. Moreover, numerals follow several pronunciation rules that involve tone changes (low tone ‚Üí creaky tone) and voicing shifts depending on the pronunciation of surrounding words. A more thorough explanation is found on [[Burmese numerals]].

=== Verbs ===
The roots of Burmese [[verbs]] are almost always suffixed with at least one particle which conveys such information as tense, intention, politeness, mood, etc. Many of these particles also have formal/literary and colloquial equivalents. In fact, the only time in which no particle is attached to a verb is in imperative commands. 

The most commonly used verb particles and their usage are shown below with an example verb root {{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''ca:'' {{IPA-my|s√°|}} "to eat". Alone, the statement {{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏}} is imperative.

The suffix {{lang|my|·Äê·Äö·Ä∫}} ''tai'' {{IPA-my|d…õÃÄ|}} (literary form: {{lang|my|·Äû·Ää·Ä∫}} ''sany'' {{IPA-my|√∞√¨|}} can be viewed as a particle marking the present tense and/or a factual statement:

:{{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Äö·Ä∫}} ''ca: tai'' {{IPA-my|s√° d…õÃÄ|}} "I eat"

The suffix {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Ä≤·Ä∑}} ''hkai.'' {{IPA-my|…°…õÃ∞|}} denotes that the action took place in the past. However, this particle is not always necessary to indicate the past tense such that it can convey the same information without it. But to emphasize that the action happened before another event that is also currently being discussed, the particle becomes imperative. Note that the suffix {{lang|my|·Äê·Äö·Ä∫}} ''tai'' {{IPA-my|d…õÃÄ|}} in this case denotes a factual statement rather than the present tense:
:{{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·ÄÅ·Ä≤·Ä∑·Äê·Äö·Ä∫}} ''ca: hkai. tai'' {{IPA-my|s√° …°…õÃ∞ d…õÃÄ|}} "I ate"

The particle {{lang|my|·Äî·Ä±}} ''ne'' {{IPA-my|n√®|}} is used to denote an action in progression. It is equivalent to the English '-ing'"
:{{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äî·Ä±·Äê·Äö·Ä∫}} ''ca: ne tai'' {{IPA-my|s√° n√® d…õÃÄ|}} "I am eating"

This particle {{lang|my|·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ}} ''pri'' {{IPA-my|bj√¨|}}, which is used when an action that had been expected to be performed by the subject is now finally being performed,  has no equivalent in English. So in the above example, if someone had been expecting you to eat and you have finally started eating, the particle {{lang|my|·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ}} is used as follows:
:{{lang|my|(·ÄÖ)·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äï·Äº·ÄÆ}} ''(ca.) ca: pri'' {{IPA-my|(s…ô) s√° bj√¨|}} "I am (now) eating"

The particle {{lang|my|·Äô·Äö·Ä∫}} ''mai'' {{IPA-my|m…õÃÄ|}} (literary form: {{lang|my|·Äô·Ää·Ä∫}} ''many'' {{IPA-my|mj√¨|}} is used to indicate the future tense or an action which is yet to be performed:
:{{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äô·Äö·Ä∫}} ''ca: mai'' {{IPA-my|s√° m…õÃÄ|}} "I will eat"

The particle {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑}} ''tau.'' {{IPA-my|d…îÃ∞|}} is used when the action is about to be performed immediately when used in conjunction with {{lang|my|·Äô·Äö·Ä∫}}. Therefore it could be termed as the "immediate future tense particle".
:{{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑·Äô·Äö·Ä∫}} ''ca: tau. mai'' {{IPA-my|s√° d…îÃ∞ m…õÃÄ|}} "I'm going to eat (straight-away)"

When {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑}} is used alone, however, it is imperative:
:{{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∑}} ''ca: tau.'' {{IPA-my|s√° d…îÃ∞|}} "Eat (now)"

Verbs are negated by the particle {{lang|my|·Äô}} ''ma.'' {{IPA-my|m…ô|}}, which is prefixed to the verb. Generally speaking, other particles are suffixed to that verb, along with {{lang|my|·Äô}}.

The verb suffix particle {{lang|my|·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑}} ''nai.'' {{IPA-my|n…õÃ∞|}} (literary form: {{lang|my|·Äî·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫}} ''hnang.'' {{IPA-my|nÃ•…™Ã∞…¥|}} indicates a command:
:{{lang|my|·Äô·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äî·Ä≤·Ä∑}} ''ma.ca: nai.'' {{IPA-my|m…ôs√° n…õÃ∞|}} Don't eat

The verb suffix particle {{lang|my|·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏}} ''bhu:'' {{IPA-my|b√∫|}} indicates a statement:
:{{lang|my|·Äô·ÄÖ·Ä¨·Ä∏·Äò·Ä∞·Ä∏}} ''ma.ca: bhu:'' {{IPA-my|m…ôs√° b√∫|}} "[I] don't eat"

=== Nouns ===
[[Noun]]s in Burmese are pluralized by suffixing the particle {{lang|my|·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±}} ''twe'' {{IPA-my|d√®|}} (or {{IPA-my|t√®|}} if the word ends in a glottal stop) in colloquial Burmese or {{lang|my|·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''mya:'' {{IPA-my|mj√†|}} in formal Burmese. The particle {{lang|my|·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑}} (tou. {{IPA-my|toÃ∞|}}, which indicates a group of persons or things, is also suffixed to the modified noun. An example is below:
* {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫}} ''mrac'' {{IPA-my|mj…™ î|}} "river"
* {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äê·ÄΩ·Ä±}} ''mrac twe'' {{IPA-my|mj…™ î t√®|}} "rivers" (colloquial)
* {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äô·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''mrac mya:'' {{IPA-my|mj…™ î mj√°|}} "rivers" (formal)
* {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äê·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∑}} ''mrac tou:'' {{IPA-my|mj…™ î toÃ∞|}} "rivers"

Plural suffixes are not used when the noun is quantified with a number.

:{|
|+"five children"
|-
| {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äú·Ä±·Ä∏}} || {{lang|my|·ÅÖ}} || {{lang|my|·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫}}
|-
| ''hka.le:'' || ''nga:'' || ''yauk''
|-
| {{IPA|/k ∞…ôl√©}} || {{IPA|≈ã√°}} || {{IPA|ja ä î/}}
|-
| child || five || classifier
|-
|}

Although Burmese does not have grammatical gender (e.g. masculine or feminine nouns), a distinction is made between the sexes, especially in animals and plants, by means of suffix particles. Nouns are masculinized with the following particles: {{lang|my|·Äë·ÄÆ·Ä∏}} ''hti:'' {{IPA-my|t ∞√≠|}}, {{lang|my|·Äñ}} ''hpa'' {{IPA-my|p ∞aÃ∞|}}, or {{lang|my|·Äñ·Ä≠·ÄØ}} ''hpui'' {{IPA-my|p ∞√≤|}}, depending on the noun, and feminized with the particle {{lang|my|·Äô}} ''ma.'' {{IPA-my|maÃ∞|}}. Examples of usage are below:
* {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äë·ÄÆ·Ä∏}} ''kraung hti:'' {{IPA-my|t…ï√† ä…¥ t ∞√≠|}} "male cat"
* {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äº·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äô}} ''kraung ma.'' {{IPA-my|t…ï√† ä…¥ maÃ∞|}} "female cat"
* {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äº·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äñ}} ''krak hpa.'' {{IPA-my|t…ï…õ î p ∞aÃ∞|}} "rooster/cock"
* {{lang|my|·Äë·Äî·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äñ·Ä≠·ÄØ}} ''htan: hpui'' {{IPA-my|t ∞√°…¥ p ∞√≤|}} "male [[toddy palm]] plant"

==== Numerical classifiers ====
{{Main|Burmese numerical classifiers}}
Like its neighboring languages such as [[Thai language|Thai]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]], Burmese uses numerical classifiers (also called measure words) when nouns are counted or quantified. This approximately equates to English expressions such as "two slices of bread" or "a cup of coffee". Classifiers are required when counting nouns, so {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äú·Ä±·Ä∏ ·ÅÖ}} ''hka.le: nga:'' {{IPA-my|k ∞…ôl√© ≈ã√†|}} (lit. "child five") is ungrammatical, because the measure word for people {{lang|my|·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫}} ''yauk'' {{IPA-my|ja ä î|}} needs to suffix the numeral.

The standard word order of quantified words is: quantified noun + numeral adjective + classifier, except in [[round number]]s (numbers that end in zero), in which the word order is flipped, where the quantified noun precedes the classifier: quantified noun + classifier + numeral adjective. The only exception to this rule is the number 10, which follows the standard word order.

Measurements of time, such as "hour," {{lang|my|·Äî·Ä¨·Äõ·ÄÆ}} "day," {{lang|my|·Äõ·ÄÄ·Ä∫}} or "month," {{lang|my|·Äú}} do not require classifiers.

Below are some of the most commonly used classifiers in Burmese.

{|class="wikitable"

=== Particles ===
The Burmese language makes prominent usage of [[Grammatical particle|particles]] (called {{lang|my|·Äï·ÄÖ·Äπ·ÄÖ·Ää·Ä∫·Ä∏}} in Burmese), which are untranslatable words that are suffixed or prefixed to words to indicate level of respect, grammatical tense, or mood. According to the ''[[Myanmar‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary]]'' (1993), there are 449 particles in the Burmese language. For example, {{lang|my|·ÄÖ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|s√°…¥|}} is a grammatical particle used to indicate the imperative mood. While {{lang|my|·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·Äï·Ä´}} ("work" + particle indicating politeness) does not indicate the imperative, {{lang|my|·Äú·ÄØ·Äï·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏·Äï·Ä´}} ("work" + particle indicating imperative mood + particle indicating politeness) does. Particles may be combined in some cases, especially those modifying verbs.

Some particles modify the word's [[part of speech]]. Among the most prominent of these is the particle {{lang|my|·Ä°}} {{IPA-my|…ô|}}, which is prefixed to verbs and adjectives to form nouns or adverbs. For instance, the word {{lang|my|·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} means "to enter," but combined with {{lang|my|·Ä°}}, it means "entrance" {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫}}. Also, in colloquial Burmese, there is a tendency to omit the second {{lang|my|·Ä°}} in words that follow the pattern {{lang|my|·Ä°}} + noun/adverb + {{lang|my|·Ä°}} + noun/adverb, like {{lang|my|·Ä°·ÄÜ·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Ä°·Ä°·ÄØ·Ä∂}}, which is pronounced {{IPA-my|…ôs ∞a ä î √∫|}} and formally pronounced {{IPA-my|…ôs ∞a ä î …ô√≤ ä…¥|}}.

=== Pronouns ===
Subject [[pronoun]]s begin sentences, though the subject is generally omitted in the imperative forms and in conversation. Grammatically speaking, subject marker particles {{lang|my|·ÄÄ}} {{IPA-my|…°aÃ∞|}} in colloquial, {{lang|my|·Äû·Ää·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|Œ∏√¨|}} in formal) must be attached to the subject pronoun, although they are also generally omitted in conversation. Object pronouns must have an object marker particle {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Ä≠·ÄØ}} {{IPA-my|…°√≤|}} in colloquial, {{lang|my|·Ä°·Ä¨·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|√°|}} in formal) attached immediately after the pronoun. Proper nouns are often substituted for pronouns. One's status in relation to the audience determines the pronouns used, with certain pronouns used for different audiences.

Polite pronouns are used to address elders, teachers and strangers, through the use of feudal-era third person pronouns in lieu of first and second person pronouns. In such situations, one refers to oneself in third person: {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫}} ''kya. nau'' {{IPA-my|t…ï…ôn…îÃÄ|}} for men and {{lang|my|·ÄÄ·Äª·ÄΩ·Äî·Ä∫·Äô}} ''kya. ma.'' {{IPA-my|t…ï…ômaÃ∞|}} for women, both meaning "your servant", and refer to the addressee as {{lang|my|·Äô·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏}} ''min'' {{IPA-my|m…™ÃÅ…¥|}} "your highness", {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äó·Äª·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''khang bya:'' {{IPA-my|k ∞…ômj√°|}} "master, lord" ({{etymology|my|·Äû·ÄÅ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äò·ÄØ·Äõ·Ä¨·Ä∏|lord master}}) or {{lang|my|·Äõ·Äæ·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} ''hrang'' {{IPA-my| É…™ÃÄ…¥|}} "ruler/master".{{sfn|Bradley|1993|p=157‚Äì160}} So ingrained are these terms in the daily polite speech that people use them as the first and second person pronouns without giving a second thought to the root meaning of these pronouns.

When speaking to a person of the same status or of younger age, {{lang|my|·ÄÑ·Ä´}} ''nga'' {{IPA-my|≈ã√†|}} "I/me" and {{lang|my|·Äî·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} ''nang'' {{IPA-my|n…™ÃÄ…¥|}} "you" may be used, although most speakers choose to use third person pronouns.{{sfn|Bradley|1993}} For example, an older person may use {{lang|my|·Äí·Ä±·Ä´·Ä∫·Äú·Ä±·Ä∏}} ''dau le:'' {{IPA-my|d…îÃÄ l√©|}} "aunt" or {{lang|my|·Ä¶·Ä∏·Äú·Ä±·Ä∏}} ''u: lei:'' {{IPA-my| î√∫ l√©|}} "uncle" to refer to himself, while a younger person may use either {{lang|my|·Äû·Ä¨·Ä∏}} ''sa:'' {{IPA-my|Œ∏√°|}} "son" or {{lang|my|·Äû·Äô·ÄÆ·Ä∏}} ''sa.mi:'' {{IPA-my|Œ∏…ôm√≠|}} "daughter".

In colloquial Burmese, possessive pronouns are contracted when the root pronoun itself is low toned. This does not occur in literary Burmese, which uses ·Åè {{IPA-my|·∏≠|}} as postpositional marker for possessive case instead of {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑}} {{IPA-my|j…õÃ∞|}}. Examples include the following:
* {{lang|my|·ÄÑ·Ä´}} {{IPA-my|≈ã√†|}} "I" + {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑}} (postpositional marker for possessive case) = {{lang|my|·ÄÑ·Ä´·Ä∑}} {{IPA-my|≈ãaÃ∞|}} "my"
* {{lang|my|·Äî·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|n…™ÃÄ…¥|}} "you" + {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑}} (postpositional marker for possessive case) = {{lang|my|·Äî·ÄÑ·Ä∑·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|n…™Ã∞…¥|}} "your"
* {{lang|my|·Äû·Ä∞}} {{IPA-my|Œ∏√π|}} "he, she" + {{lang|my|·Äõ·Ä≤·Ä∑}} (postpositional marker for possessive case) = {{lang|my|·Äû·Ä∞·Ä∑}} {{IPA-my|Œ∏·πµ|}} "his, her"
The contraction also occurs in some low toned nouns, making them possessive nouns (e.g. {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äô·Ä±·Ä∑}} or {{lang|my|·Äô·Äº·Äî·Ä∫·Äô·Ä¨·Ä∑}}, "mother's" and "Myanmar's" respectively).

==== Family terms ====
{{Main|Burmese kinship}}
Minor pronunciation differences do exist within regions of Irrawaddy valley. For example, the pronunciation {{IPA|[s ∞ äÃÅ…¥]}} of {{lang|my|·ÄÜ·ÄΩ·Äô·Ä∫·Ä∏}} "food offering [to a monk]" is preferred in Lower Burma, instead of {{IPA|[s ∞w√°…¥]}}, which is preferred in Upper Burma. However, the most obvious difference between Upper Burmese and Lower Burmese is that Upper Burmese speech still differentiates maternal and paternal sides of a family:

In a testament to the power of media, the Yangon-based speech is gaining currency even in Upper Burma. Upper Burmese-specific usage, while historically and technically accurate, is increasingly viewed as countrified speech, or at best regional speech. In fact, some usages are already considered strictly regional Upper Burmese speech, and are likely dying out. For example:

|
* {{lang|my|·Ää·ÄÆ·Äô}} {{IPA-my|…≤√¨ maÃ∞|}}
|}
In general, the male-centric names of old Burmese for familial terms have been replaced in standard Burmese with formerly female-centric terms, which are now used by both sexes. One holdover is the use of {{lang|my|·Ää·ÄÆ}} (younger brother to a male) and {{lang|my|·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} (younger brother to a female). Terms like {{lang|my|·Äî·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} (elder brother to a male) and {{lang|my|·Äî·Äæ·Äô}} (younger sister to a male) now are used in standard Burmese only as part of compound words like {{lang|my|·Ää·ÄÆ·Äî·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} (brothers) or {{lang|my|·Äô·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äî·Äæ·Äô}} (brother and sister).

=== Reduplication ===
[[Reduplication]] is prevalent in Burmese and is used to intensify or weaken adjectives' meanings. For example, {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Äª·Ä±·Ä¨}} {{IPA-my|t…ï ∞…îÃÅ|}} "beautiful" is reduplicated, the intensity of the adjective's meaning increases. Many Burmese words, especially adjectives with two syllables, such as {{lang|my|·Äú·Äæ·Äï}} {{IPA-my|lÃ•aÃ∞paÃ∞|}} "beautiful", when reduplicated ({{lang|my|·Äú·Äæ·Äï}} ‚Üí {{lang|my|·Äú·Äæ·Äú·Äæ·Äï·Äï}} {{IPA-my|lÃ•aÃ∞lÃ•aÃ∞ paÃ∞paÃ∞|}}) become [[adverb]]s. This is also true of some Burmese verbs and nouns (e.g. {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Äè}} "a moment" ‚Üí {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Äè·ÄÅ·Äè}} "frequently", which become adverbs when reduplicated.

Some nouns are also reduplicated to indicate plurality. For instance, {{lang|my|·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|pj√¨|}} "country", but when reduplicated to {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|…ôpj√¨ pj√¨|}} "country", means "many countries," as in {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·Ää·Ä∫·ÄÜ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äõ·Ä¨}} {{IPA-my|…ôpj√¨ pj√¨ s ∞√†…™…¥ j√†|}} "international". Another example is {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äô·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏}}, which means "a kind," but the reduplicated form {{lang|my|·Ä°·Äô·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏·Äô·Äª·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏}} means "multiple kinds."

A few measure words can also be reduplicated to indicate "one or the other":
* {{lang|my|·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫}} (measure word for people) ‚Üí {{lang|my|·Äê·ÄÖ·Ä∫·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫·Äö·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÄ·Ä∫}} (someone)
* {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·ÄØ}} (measure word for things) ‚Üí {{lang|my|·Äê·ÄÖ·Ä∫·ÄÅ·ÄØ·ÄÅ·ÄØ}} (something)

== Romanization and transcription ==
{{Main|Romanization of Burmese}}

There is no official [[romanization]] system for Burmese. There have been attempts to make one, but none have been successful. Replicating Burmese sounds in the Latin script is complicated. There is a Pali-based transcription system in existence, [[MLC Transcription System]] which was devised by the [[Myanmar Language Commission]] (MLC). However, it only transcribes sounds in formal Burmese and is based on the orthography rather than the phonology.

Several colloquial transcription systems have been proposed, but none is overwhelmingly preferred over others.

Transcription of Burmese is not standardized, as seen in the varying English transcriptions of Burmese names. For instance, a Burmese personal name like {{lang|my|·Äù·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Ä∏}} {{IPA-my|w…™ÃÅ…¥|}} may be variously romanized as Win, Winn, Wyn, or Wynn, while {{lang|my|·ÄÅ·Ä≠·ÄØ·ÄÑ·Ä∫}} {{IPA-my|k ∞√†…™…¥|}} may be romanized as Khaing, Khine, or Khain.

== Computer fonts and standard keyboard layout ==
[[File:Myanmar-Keyboard-Layout.png|thumb|400px|Myanmar3, the ''de jure'' standard Burmese keyboard layout]]
The Burmese script can be entered from a standard [[QWERTY keyboard]], and is supported within the Unicode standard, meaning it can be read and written from most modern computers and smartphones.

Burmese has complex character rendering requirements, where tone markings and vowel modifications are noted using diacritics. These can be placed before consonants (as with {{lang|my|·Ä±}}), above them (as with {{lang|my|·Ä≠}}) or even around them (as with {{lang|my|·Äº}}). These character clusters are built using multiple keystrokes. In particular, the inconsistent placement of diacritics as a feature of the language presents a conflict between an intuitive [[WYSIWYG]] typing approach, and a logical consonant-first storage approach.

Since its introduction in 2007, the most popular Burmese font, [[Zawgyi font|Zawgyi]], has been near-ubiquitous in Myanmar. Linguist Justin Watkins argues that the ubiquitous use of Zawgyi harms Myanmar languages, including Burmese, by preventing efficient sorting, searching, processing and analyzing Myanmar text through flexible diacritic ordering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themimu.info/sites/themimu.info/files/documents/Presentation_Why_Stop_Zawgyi_Use_Unicode_Phandeeyar_Aug2016.pdf|title=Why we should stop Zawgyi in its tracks. It harms others and ourselves. Use Unicode!|last=Watkins|first=Justin|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zawgyi is not [[Unicode]]-compliant, but occupies the same code space as Unicode Myanmar font.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Font|title=Myanmar Wikipedia ‚Äì Font|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}} As it is not defined as a standard character encoding, Zawgyi is not built in to any major operating systems as standard. However, allow for its position as the ''de facto'' (but largely undocumented) standard within the country, telcos and major smartphone distributors (such as Huawei and Samsung) ship phones with Zawgyi font overwriting standard Unicode-compliant fonts, which are installed on most internationally-distributed hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://frontiermyanmar.net/en/features/battle-of-the-fonts|title=Battle of the fonts|last=Hotchkiss|first=Griffin|date=23 March 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook also supports Zawgyi as an additional language encoding for their app and website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.lwinmoe.org/2015/12/facebook-nods-to-zawgyi-and-unicode.html|title=Facebook nods to Zawgyi and Unicode|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, almost all SMS alerts (including those from telcos to their customers), social media posts and other web resources may be incomprehensible on these devices without the custom Zawgyi font installed at the operating system level. These may include devices purchased overseas, or distributed by companies who do not customize software for the local market.

Keyboards which have a Zawgyi keyboard layout printed on them are the most commonly available for purchase domestically.

Until recently, Unicode compliant fonts have been more difficult to type than Zawgyi, as they have a stricter, less forgiving and arguably less intuitive method for ordering diacritics. However, intelligent input software such as Keymagic&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://keymagic.net/|title=Keymagic Unicode Keyboard Input Customizer|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent versions of smartphone soft-keyboards including [[Gboard]] and ttKeyboard&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myopenware.ttkeyboard.latin&amp;hl=en|title=TTKeyboard ‚Äì Myanmar Keyboard|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow for more forgiving input sequences and Zawgyi keyboard layouts which produce Unicode-compliant text.

A number of Unicode-compliant Burmese fonts exist. The national standard keyboard layout is known as the Myanmar3 layout, and it was published along with the Myanmar3 Unicode font. The layout, developed by the [[Myanmar Unicode and NLP Research Center]], has a smart input system to cover the complex structures of Burmese and related scripts.

In addition to the development of computer fonts and standard keyboard layout, there is still a lot of scope of research for the Burmese language, specifically for Natural Language Processing (NLP) areas like WordNet, Search Engine, development of parallel corpus for Burmese language as well as development of a formally standardized and dense domain-specific corpus of Burmese language.{{sfn|Saini|2016|p=8}}

[[File:22nd-CanCup-Art.jpg|thumb|250px|Poster art for the 22nd ''High Times'' Cannabis Cup, 2009]]

The ''[[High Times]]'' '''Cannabis Cup''' is the world‚Äôs foremost [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] festival. Founded in 1988 by [[Steven Hager]], the ''High Times'' Cannabis Cup is held each November in [[Amsterdam]]. The event allows judges from around the world to sample and vote for their favorite marijuana varieties. These judges-at-large decide the Cannabis Cup (overall winner in the cannabis variety competition), best new product, best booth, best glass, best [[hashish|hash]] and best Nederhash. A team of VIP judges decides which seed company has grown the best ''indica'', ''sativa'' and hybrid strain and which company  has produced the best Neder hash (hashish that is produced only in the Netherlands) and best imported hash.  The ''High Times'' Cannabis Cup also includes live music, educational seminars and an expo for marijuana-related products from cannabis-oriented businesses.

In 2010, ''High Times'' mounted its first Cannabis Cup in the United States. The magazine now holds Cannabis Cups in Northern and Southern California, Denver, Michigan, Seattle, with plans to hold a Cannabis Cup in Portland in 2015. The ''High Times'' Medical Cannabis Cup celebrates medical marijuana in states that have passed medical marijuana laws. The U.S. Cannabis Cup celebrates marijuana in states that have passed laws that legalize marijuana for adult, recreational use. Like the ''High Times'' Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, marijuana strains are judged and Cups (trophies) are awarded in a number of categories. Teams of expert judges vote on best ''indica'', best ''sativa'', best hybrid, best concentrates, best edibles and highest level of CBD in cannabis products. Attendees vote for best booth, best products and best glass of each Cannabis Cup expo.

All cannabis products are additionally  tested for THC content and CBD content by independent cannabis testing laboratories.

In 2014, Amsterdam saw its last and final ''High Times'' Cannabis Cup, after 27 years of the cup in Amsterdam. This was partly due to the growing uncertainty about Dutch cannabis laws,  the now available warmer, legal cannabis locations in the United States and various other countries, and the ill-fated and first ever police raid on the 2010 Amsterdam Cannabis Cup location.

In 2017, the festival celebrated its 30th anniversary. The festival featured an award show hosted by Danny Danko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hightimes.com/news/winners-2017-amsterdam-cannabis-cup/|title=Winners Of The 2017 Amsterdam Cannabis Cup ¬∑ High Times|website=hightimes.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Counterculture Hall of Fame==
{{Main article|Counterculture Hall of Fame}}

Created in 1997 to celebrate the history of the counterculture and the people who helped shape it, the [[Counterculture Hall of Fame]] holds its induction ceremony during the ''High Times'' Cannabis Cup each November.

'''''Cocido madrile√±o''''' ("Madrilenian stew", {{IPA-es|koÀàŒ∏i√∞o ma√∞…æiÀàle…≤o}}) is a traditional [[chickpea]]-based [[stew]] from [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. A substantial dish prepared with meat and vegetables, it is most popular during the winter but is served throughout the year in some restaurants.

==History==
The origins of the dish are uncertain, but most sources agree that probably it was created during the [[Middle Ages]] as an evolution of the [[Sephardic]] dish [[adafina]]. Long-cooking dishes were indispensable for [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Jews]] as they allowed hearty meals during [[Shabbat]]. These first versions were [[kosher]], using [[Egg (food)|eggs]] and without [[pork]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daft|first1=Rohan|title=Menu Del Dia: More Than 100 Classic, Authentic Recipes From Across Spain|date=2008|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781416579618|page=74|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ohvX5Wih5EwC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=Cocido+madrile%C3%B1o+sephardic&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwician7yZbbAhXLbRQKHeR2AacQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Cocido%20madrile%C3%B1o%20sephardic&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within time, adafina was soon popular elsewhere{{Where?|date=May 2015}}.

The growth of [[anti-Semitism]] and the [[Inquisition]] during the 15th and 16th centuries modified the dish substantially, as the fear of being denounced as Jewish forced [[Christians]] and ''[[Marranos]]'' (converted Jews) alike to prove themselves as Christians by incorporating pork into their meals. Soon [[lard]], [[bacon]], ''[[chorizo]]'' (pork sausage) and ''[[morcilla]]'' (blood sausage) were added to the dish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spain-recipes.com/cocido-recipe.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From these origins, the recipe allowed few modifications and was soon established as a staple of [[Madrid]] cuisine. During the growth of the city in the 19th and 20th centuries, its low cost and heartiness made it a popular order in small [[restaurants]] and the [[taverns]] catering to manual workers. After the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]], the austerity period, followed by the introduction of more convenient meals, reduced the public popularity of the dish.

==Ingredients==
[[File:Cozido madrileno.jpg|thumb|Cocido madrile√±o]]
The main ingredient of ''cocido'' is the [[chickpea]] or ''garbanzo''. Vegetables are added: [[potatoes]] mainly, but also [[cabbage]], [[carrots]], and [[turnips]]. In some cases, [[green bean]], [[Chard|mangold]] and [[cardoon]] are also added.

The meat used is fundamentally [[pork]]: [[pork belly]], usually fresh, but sometimes [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] (some purists even insist to a point of [[Rancidification|rancidity]]); fresh (unsmoked) ''[[chorizo]]''; [[onion]] ''[[morcilla]]'', and dried and cured [[jam√≥n serrano]]. [[Beef shank]] is also added; the [[fat]] content (''flor'') of the piece is highly prized. [[Chicken]] (especially old [[wikt:hen|hens]]) is also part of the ''cocido''.

Two [[bone]] pieces ([[ham]] bone and [[beef]] [[Vertebral column|spine]] bone) are added to enrich the [[stock (food)|stock]].

For some recipes, the final touch is the ''bola'', a [[meatball]]-like mix of [[ground beef]], [[bread crumbs]], [[parsley]] and other [[spices]], which, it is said,{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} was created as a substitute of the eggs used in the ''adafaina''.

==On the table==
Tradition rules that the ingredients of ''cocido'' must be served separately. Each serving is known as a ''vuelco'' (tipping or emptying out), as at each time the [[Cooking pot|pot]] must be emptied out to separate the ingredients.

The first ''vuelco'' is to separate the [[stock (food)|stock]] of the ''cocido'' and serve it with [[noodles]] added. The second ''vuelco'' consists of the chickpeas and the vegetables. The third ''vuelco'' is the meat dish.

==Leftovers==
Traditionally, dishes made with the leftovers of the ''cocido'' include Spanish ''croquetas'' ([[croquettes]]), ''[[ropa vieja]]'' and ''[[pring√°]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">Culture of the Republic of the Congo is rich, diverse and made up of a mix of about 4.5 million people in 2015 and just as many languages and customs. 

Half of [[republic of the Congo|Congolese]] people follow traditional beliefs, and there are 15 principle [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups and more than 70 subgroups. The other half are 35% [[Roman Catholic]], 15% other Christian and 2% [[Muslim]].  The region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes, who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin. Congo-Brazzaville was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa.

==Language and writings==

The official language of the Republic of Congo is French. French is spoken by 56% of the Congolese population (78% of the population over 10 years), the second highest percentage of Africa in 2010, behind that of Gabon2. About 88% of Brazzavillans over 15 years of age say they have an easy expression in French.
The Republic of Congo has a number of well-known writers in Africa and the French-speaking world: [[Alain Mabanckou]], [[Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard]], [[Jeannette Balou Tchichelle]], [[Henri Lopes]], [[Lassy Mbouity]] and [[Tchicaya U Tam'si]].

Several artistic genres such as Congolese cinema struggle to make their breakthrough. After a promising start in the 1970s, the turbulent political environment and the closing of cinemas made production difficult. The country produces no feature films a year and filmmakers broadcast their production directly in video. In the end, in Congo-Brazzaville, culture remained until then the poor relation of the investments of successive governments.

{{Disability}}
'''Disability studies''' is an academic discipline that examines the meaning, nature, and consequences of [[disability]]. Initially the field focused on the division between "impairment" and "disability", where impairment was an impairment of an individual's mind or body, while disability was considered a [[social constructionism|social construct]].&lt;ref name=MLA&gt;{{cite web|title=Session Details: Avenues of Access: The State of Disability Studies|url=http://www.mla.org/conv_listings_detail?prog_id=570&amp;year=2013|website=Modern Language Association|publisher=Modern Language Association|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This premise gave rise to two distinct models of disability: the [[Social model of disability|social]] and [[medical model of disability|medical]] models of disability. In 1999 the social model was universally accepted as the model preferred by the field.&lt;ref name=Models1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bickenbacha|first1=Jerome E|last2=Chatterji|first2=Somnath|last3=Badley|first3=E.M.|last4=√úst√ºn|first4=T.B.|title=Models of disablement, universalism and the international classification of impairments, disabilities and handicaps|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1999|volume=48|issue=9|pages=1173‚Äì1187|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953698004419%20/%20bbib10|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(98)00441-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years, the division between the social and medical models has been challenged.&lt;ref name=MLA/&gt;&lt;ref name="anti-social"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewsbury|first1=Guy|last2=Karen|first2=Clarke|last3=Randallb|first3=Dave|last4=Rouncefield|first4=Mark|last5=Sommerville|first5=Ian|title=The anti‚Äêsocial model of disability|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=Oct 2010|volume=19|issue=2|pages=145‚Äì158|doi=10.1080/0968759042000181776|citeseerx=10.1.1.140.9006}}&lt;!--|accessdate=26 March 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally there has been an increased focus on interdisciplinary research.&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs&gt;{{cite web|title=what is disability studies?|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/what_is_ds|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, recent investigations suggest using "cross-sectional markers of stratification"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Siordia | first1 = C | year = 2014 | title = Disability Prevalence According to a Class, Race, and Sex (CRS) Hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Racial &amp; Ethnic Health Disparities | volume =  2| issue = 3| pages =  303‚Äì310| doi = 10.1007/s40615-014-0073-8 | pmid = 26539340 | pmc = 4628829}}&lt;/ref&gt; may help provide new insights on the non-random distribution of risk factors capable of acerbating disablement processes.

Disability studies courses include work in disability history, theory, legislation, policy, ethics, and the arts. However, students are taught to focus on the lived experiences of individuals with disabilities in practical terms. The field is focused on increasing individuals with disabilities access to [[civil rights]] and improving their [[quality of life]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last1=CAPUZZI SIMON|first1=CECILIA|title=Disability Studies: A New Normal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/education/edlife/disability-studies-a-new-normal.html?_r=0|accessdate=26 March 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disability studies emerged in the 1980s primarily in the US, the UK, and Canada. In 1986, the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of the Social Science Association (United States) was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]].&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission and History|url=https://www.disstudies.org/about/mission-and-history|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The first edition of the Disabilities Studies Reader (one of the first collections of academic papers related to disability studies) was published in 1997.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Davis|editor-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=1997|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415914703}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field grew rapidly over the next ten years. In 2005, the [[Modern Language Association]] established disability studies as a ‚Äúdivision of study.‚Äù &lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==History==
Universities have long studied disabilities from a clinical perspective.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1986 the Section for the Study of Chronic Illness, Impairment, and Disability of Social Science Association was renamed the [[Society for Disability Studies]]&lt;ref name=SDSMissionandHistory/&gt; and its journal "[[Disability Studies Quarterly]]" was the first journal in disability studies. The first US disabilities studies program emerged in 1994, at [[Syracuse University]].&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; However, courses and programs were very few. In the 1997 first edition of the "Disability Studies Reader" Lennard J. Davis wrote that "it had been virtually impossible to have someone teaching about disability within the humanities".&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; In the second edition, written ten years later, he writes that "all that has changed", but "just because disability studies is on the map, does not mean that is easy to find".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Davis|editor1-first=Lennard J.|title=The disability studies reader|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415953337|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still the field continued to grow throughout the 2000s. In 2009 Disability Studies Quarterly published a A Multinational Review of English-language Disability Studies Degrees and Courses. They found that from 2003 to 2008 the number of disability studies stand alone studies courses in the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand and Canada grew from 56 to 108 and the number of degree granting courses grew from 212 to 420. A total of 17 degrees in disability studies were offered, with 11 programs in the US, 2 in the UK, 3 in Canada, and one in Australia.&lt;ref name=DSQ:ProgramReview&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Multinational Review Of English-Language Disability Studies Degrees And Courses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2009|volume=29|issue=3|url=http://dsq-sds.org/issue/view/41|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v29i3.940 | last1 = Cushing | first1 = Pamela | last2 = Smith | first2 = Tyler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 [[New York Times]] article "Disability Studies: A New Normal" suggests that the expansion in disability studies programs is related to the 1990 passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA). Those raised after the passage of the ADA have entered colleges and the workforce, as Disability Studies has grown. In a 2014 article, Disability Studies Quarterly published an analysis on the relationships between student run groups and disability studies, from 2008 to 2012. Their article analyzes groups at four different universities and describes how professors have incorporated student activism into their curriculum and research.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stout|first1=Allegra|last2=Schwartz|first2=Ariel|title="It'll Grow Organically and Naturally": The Reciprocal Relationship between Student Groups and Disability Studies on College Campuses|journal=Disability Studies Quarterly|date=2014|volume=34|issue=2|url=http://dsq-sds.org/article/view/4253/3593|accessdate=26 March 2015|doi=10.18061/dsq.v34i2.4253}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
According to the transnational&lt;ref name=SDSAbout&gt;{{cite web|title=About|url=http://disstudies.org/about|website=Society for Disability Studies|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Society for Disability Studies]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Using an interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary approach.  Disability sits at the intersection of many overlapping disciplines in the humanities, sciences, and social sciences.  Programs in Disability Studies should encourage a curriculum that allows students, activists, teachers, artists, practitioners, and researchers to engage the subject matter from various disciplinary perspectives.

*Challenging the view of disability as an individual deficit or defect that can be remedied solely through medical intervention or rehabilitation by "experts" and other service providers.  Rather, a program in Disability Studies should explore models and theories that examine social, political, cultural, and economic factors that define disability and help determine personal and collective responses to difference. At the same time, Disability Studies should work to de-stigmatize disease, illness, and impairment, including those that cannot be measured or explained by biological science.  Finally, while acknowledging that medical research and intervention can be useful, Disability Studies should interrogate the connections between medical practice and stigmatizing disability.
*Studying national and international perspectives, policies, literature, culture, and history with an aim of placing current ideas of disability within their broadest possible context.  Since attitudes toward disability have not been the same across times and places, much can be gained by learning from these other experiences.
*Encouraging participation by disabled students and faculty, and ensuring physical and intellectual access. Prioritizing leadership positions held by disabled people; at the same time, it is important to create an environment where contributions from anyone who shares the above goals are welcome."&lt;ref name=SDSWhatIs /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Disability studies and medical humanities==
The [[social model of disability]] is expanded to chronic illness and to the broader work of the [[medical humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garden|first=R|title=Disability and narrative: new directions for medicine and the medical humanities|journal=Medical Humanities|date=December 2010|volume=36|issue=2|pages=70‚Äì4|pmid=21393285|doi=10.1136/jmh.2010.004143}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners are working towards improving the healthcare for disabled people through disability studies. This multi-disciplinary field of inquiry draws on the experiences and perspectives of people with disabilities to address discrimination. [[Infinite Ability]] has done some preliminary work in [[India]] to introduce disability studies to medical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|author2=Khosla, J |author3=Sridhar, S |title=Exploring medical humanities through theatre of the oppressed|journal=Indian Journal of Psychiatry|date=July 2012|volume=54|issue=3|pages=296‚Äì7|pmid=23226869|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.102461|pmc=3512382}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khetarpal|first=A|author2=Singh, S|title=Infertility: Why can't we classify this inability as disability?|journal=The Australasian Medical Journal|year=2012|volume=5|issue=6|pages=334‚Äì9|pmid=22848333|doi=10.4066/AMJ.2012.1290|pmc=3395292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Singh|first=S|title=Broadening horizons: looking beyond disability|journal=Medical Education|date=May 2012|volume=46|issue=5|page=522|pmid=22515781|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2923.2012.04246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intersectionality==
[[Feminism]] introduces the inclusion of [[intersectionality]] in disability studies. It focuses on [[race (human categorization)|race]], [[gender]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[Class (social)|class]] and other related systems of [[oppression]] that can also intersect with having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gillborn|first=David|date=2015|title=Intersectionality, Critical Race Theory, and the Primacy of Racism: Race, Class, Gender, and Disability in Education.|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=277‚Äì287|doi=10.1177/1077800414557827}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminism standpoint, there is a large concern for grasping multiple positions and differences among social groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Tina Goethals|first=|last2=Elisabeth De Schauwer|last3=Geert Van Hove|date=|year=2015|title=Weaving Intersectionality into Disability Studies Research: Inclusion, Reflexivity and Anti-Essentialism|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075.pdf?refreqid=excelsior:000f48af9d031f8db8036895074aa270|journal=Digest. Journal of Diversity and Gender Studies|language=en|volume=2|pages=75|doi=10.11116/jdivegendstud.2.1-2.0075|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some research on intersectionality and disability has focused on the aspect of being part of two or more stigmatized groups and how these are contributing factors to multiple forms of harassment, the paradox known as "Double Jeopardy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Linda R.|last2=Chan|first2=Fong|last3=McMahon|first3=Brian T.|date=2011-12-29|title=Intersectionality and Disability Harassment|journal=Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=82‚Äì91|doi=10.1177/0034355211431167|issn=0034-3552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Race===
Recent scholarship has included studies that explore the intersection between disability and race. Ellen Samuels explores [[Gender studies|gender]], queer sexualities, and disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womenstudies.wisc.edu/professional-pages/samuels.htm|title=Department of Gender and Women's Studies|date=2013-02-27|publisher=Womenstudies.wisc.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disabilitystudies.syr.edu/resources/feministdisabilitystudies.aspx|title=Women and Disability: Feminist Disability Studies [Disability Studies&amp;#93;|publisher=Disabilitystudies.syr.edu|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher Bell (scholar)|Christopher Bell]]‚Äôs posthumous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca/2009/12/obituary-chris-bell-disability-studies.html|title=Media dis&amp;dat: Obituary: Chris Bell, disability studies scholar on race, HIV/AIDS, dies|author=BA Haller|date=2009-12-26|publisher=Media-dis-n-dat.blogspot.ca|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; volume on ''Blackness and Disability'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2N8uMz6g02gC|title=Blackness and Disability: Critical Examinations and Cultural Interventions - Google Boeken|year=2011|isbn=9783643101266|accessdate=2013-05-07|last1=Bell|first1=Christopher M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the work of [[Robert McRuer]] both explore [[Queer theory|queerness]] and disability. These works engage with issues of [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic oppression. Scholars of Feminist Disability Studies include [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] and Alison Kafer. {{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} The 2009 publication of Fiona Kumari Campbell‚Äôs "Contours of Ableism: The Production of Disability and Abledness" signalled a new direction of research ‚Äî studies in ableism, moving beyond preoccupations with disability to explore the maintenance of abledness in sexed, raced and modified bodies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Similarly, recent work has focused on the intersections of race and ethnicity with disability in the field of education studies and attempted to bridge Critical Race Studies with Dis/ability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies (DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1‚Äì31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work reflects an effort to deal with complex histories of marking racially "othered" bodies as physically, psychologically, or morally deficient, and traces this history of scientific racism to contemporary dynamics. Empirical studies show that minority students are disproportionately more likely to be removed from class or school for "behavioral" or academic reasons, and far more likely to be labeled with intellectual or learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Annamma|first=Subini Ancy|date=18 November 2015|title=Dis/ability critical race studies(DisCrit): theorizing at theintersections of race and dis/ability|url=https://www.academia.edu/2258717|journal=Race Ethnicity and Education|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1‚Äì31|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors propose a union of critical race and disability studies, DisCrit, as an intersectional approach designed to analyzing the interaction between ableism, sexism, and racism.

In addition to work by individual scholars, disability studies organizations have also begun to focus on disability and race and gender. The Society for Disability Studies created the Chris Bell Memorial Scholarship to honor Bell's commitment to diversity in disability studies.&lt;ref name="SDSBell"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|title=chris bell memorial scholarship|website=Society for Disability Studies|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402160435/https://www.disstudies.org/awards/chris-bell|archivedate=2 April 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=26 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postsecondary disability studies programs increasingly engage with the [[intersectionality]] of oppression.  The [[University of Manitoba]] offers a course in on "Women with disabilities".&lt;ref name="ManitobaCourses"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umanitoba.ca/disability_studies/contents/courses.html|title=Disability Studies Courses|website=University of Manitoba|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several recent masters' student research papers at [[York University]] focus on issues related to women with disabilities and people of African descent with disabilities.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdis.gradstudies.yorku.ca/ma/mrp/|title=COMPLETED MA PROJECT RESEARCH PAPERS|website=York University|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Feminism integrates the social and political aspects that makes a body oppressed while allowing empowerment to be present in acknowledging its culture. [[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]] explains that these related systems of oppression pervades all aspects of culture by "its structuring institutions, social identities, cultural practices, political positions, historical communities, and the shared human experience of embodiment". Garland-Thomson further describes that "identity based critical enterprises have enriched and complicated our understandings of social justice, subject formation, subjugated knowledges and collective action".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Garland-Thomson, Rosemarie. "Integrating disability, transforming feminist theory." NWSA journal 14.3 (2002): 1-32|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminism works towards [[accessibility]] for everyone regardless of which societal oppressive behavior makes them a [[minority group|minority]]. Although physical adjustments are most commonly fought for in disability awareness, psychological exclusion also plays a major role oppressing people with disabilities. [[Sara Ahmed]] elaborates the mental exclusiveness of privilege in "Atmospheric Walls", that there is an atmosphere that surrounds minority bodies which explains why an intersectionally privileged person could be made uncomfortable simply by being in the same room as a person of color, or in this case someone with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ahmed, Sara N. "Atmospheric Walls." Feministkilljoys. N.p., 2014. Web. 10 Oct. 2016|journal=|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists and scholars also developed theories that put attention on the connection of gender and disability. Scholars like Thomas J. Gerschick argued that disability plays a big role on processing and experiencing gender, and people with disabilities often suffer stigmatization towards their gender, since their disabilities may make their body representation excluded by normative binary gender representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gerschick|first=Thomas J.|date=2000-07-01|title=Toward a Theory of Disability and Gender|journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society|volume=25|issue=4|pages=1263‚Äì1268|doi=10.1086/495558|issn=0097-9740}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerschick also argues that this stigmatization can affect the gendering process and self-representation of people with disabilities. Feminists also look into how people with disabilities are politically oppressed and powerless. Abby L. Wilkerson argues that people with disabilities are politically powerless because they are often desexualized, and the lack of sexual agency leads to the lack of political agency. Wilkerson also indicates that the erotophobia towards minority groups like people with disabilities further oppresses them, since it prevents these groups from gaining political power through sexual agency and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilkerson|first=Abby|date=2002|title=Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency|jstor=4316923|journal=NWSA Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=33‚Äì57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and sexuality===
The intersectionality of disability and LGBTQ communities is a more modern subject of study in which the relevance, historically, came about mostly in the 1960s and the 1970s with the surge of advocates in the midst of the vocal liberation and civil rights movements.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} These communities on their own are topics of numerous deliberations, however they also often link in significance in many ways. The significance of the movements however, began to build momentum and most legal recognition in the 1980s. It was from this age of advocacy that the intersectionality of these two minority groups came into a more clear focus, though it is one continuously growing subject of discussion.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} It was only in 1973 that the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from their list of mental disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drescher|first=Jack|date=2015|title=Out of DSM: Depathologizing Homosexuality|journal=Behavioral Sciences|volume=5|issue=4|pages=565‚Äì575|pmc=4695779|pmid=26690228|doi=10.3390/bs5040565}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, it was about forty years later in 2013 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition ([[DSM-5]]) changed the listing of transgender to ‚Äúgender dysphoria‚Äù.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|last=American Psychiatric Association|date=2013-05-22|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|isbn=978-0890425558|language=en|doi=10.1176/appi.books.9780890425596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most notable circumstances where the case of these two minority rights come together was the court case ''[[In re Guardianship of Kowalski]]'', in which an accident that occurred in 1983 left a thirty-six year old Sharon Kowalski physically disabled with severe brain injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/07/us/gay-groups-are-rallied-to-aid-2-women-s-fight.html|title=Gay Groups Are Rallied To Aid 2 Women's Fight|last=Brozan|first=Nadine|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court granted guardianship of her to her homophobic parents who refused visitation rights to her long time partner, Karen Thompson. The court case lasted nearly ten years and was resolved by granting Thompson custody in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/18/us/disabled-woman-s-care-given-to-lesbian-partner.html|title=Disabled Woman's Care Given to Lesbian Partner|last=Lewin|first=Tamar|access-date=2018-10-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a major victory in the realm of gay rights but also called to attention the validity of rights for those who identified under the queer and disabled spectrum. Numerous support groups emerged from necessity to create safe spaces for those identifying in these specific minority groups such as the founding of the Rainbow Alliance of the Deaf in 1977,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} the Lesbian Disabled Veterans of America group in 1996{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} which then became the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Disabled Veterans of America, and the San Francisco Gay Amputees group in 2006.

A 2012 study showed that disability was more common in gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals when compared to heterosexual peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fredriksen-Goldsen|first=Karen I.|last2=Kim|first2=Hyun-Jun|last3=Barkan|first3=Susan E.|date=2012|title=Disability Among Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Adults: Disparities in Prevalence and Risk|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490559/|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=1|pages=e16‚Äìe21|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2011.300379|issn=0090-0036|pmc=3490559|pmid=22095356|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also shown that the gay, lesbian, and bisexual group with disabilities were noticeably younger in age than the heterosexual group. There was a significant difference in the prevalence of mental and physical health between the study groups, a higher statistic of those with queer identities having issues health wise than those straight identifying, reportedly due to the weight of social pressure and discrimination of minority sexual identities.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Though these minority groups do not always intersect, the way they handle their own discrimination, can be compared in similar ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Being that both the LGBTQ rights movement and the disability rights movements have been defined as minority discrimination movements, it has been said{{by whom|date=May 2017}} that they are a direct contrast to society normalizing the dominance of heterosexuality and able-bodiedness in its majority population. It is also a large topic of discussion to say that both groups have to undergo the same kind of "coming out" process in terms of their sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity because of the lasting social stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2015|title=Addressing Disability Stigma within the Lesbian Community|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43888838/Lesbian___Disability.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1539886805&amp;Signature=JzL0VYPNkGAJAKigLgay9NP0i%2F0%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAddressing_Disability_Stigma_within_the.pdf|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation|volume=81|pages=49‚Äì56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Coming out" through sexual identity, gender identity, and disability identity is one example of "Double Jeopardy", as they are part of more than one stigmatized group.

[[Queer studies]] which emerged from [[women's studies]], brings light towards the different kind of oppression [[queer]] and [[transgender]] people with disabilities have. For example, the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]] dismisses [[gender disphoria]] because of its moral case against transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry |first=Kevin M. |title=Disabilityqueer: Federal Disability Rights Protection for Transgender People |date=February 18, 2014 |journal=Yale Human Rights and Development Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |page=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/yhrdlj/vol16/iss1/1/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Queer studies are commonly associated with people with disabilities who identify as ‚ÄúCrip‚Äù and is commonly believed that queer politics must incorporate crip politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=McRuer |first=Robert |title=Cripping Queer Politics, or the Dangers of Neoliberalism |website=S&amp;F Online |url=http://sfonline.barnard.edu/a-new-queer-agenda/cripping-queer-politics-or-the-dangers-of-neoliberalism/ |issue=10.1‚Äì10.2 |date=Fall 2011 ‚Äì Spring 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alison Kafer describes a first person experience of identifying queer and crip both bold reappropriated terms in Kafer's novel, "Feminist Queer Crip". Kafer describes the politics of the crip future and "an insistence on thinking these imagined futures - and hence, these lived presents - differently".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kafer|first1=Alison|title=Feminist, queer, crip|date=2013|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253009227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many activists with disabilities find empowerment in appropriating the term crip, not all people with disabilities feel comfortable using that identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=V3GPb2obU0gC&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Crip+Theory:+Cultural+Signs+of+Queerness+and+Disability#v=onepage&amp;q=Crip%20Theory:%20Cultural%20Signs%20of%20Queerness%20and%20Disability&amp;f=false|title=Crip Theory: Cultural Signs of Queerness and Disability|last=McRuer|first=Robert|date=2006-06-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814761090|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many different terms used as an alternative to disability, for example Melwood, a nonprofit who uses the term "differing abilities", describes the label disability as  "a limitation in the ability to pursue an occupation because of a physical or mental impairment; a disqualification, restriction or disadvantage and a lack of legal qualification to do something, was an inadequate or limiting 'label' for a cross section of people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Disabilities" vs. "Differing Abilities" |url=https://www.melwood.org/disabilities-vs-differing-abilities|website=Melwood|accessdate=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term disability has a history of inferiority, it is believed by many that substituting the term will help eliminate the [[ableism]] that is embedded within it. Susan Wendell describes ableism in society "as a structure for people who have no weakness",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wendell |first=Susan |title=Toward a Feminist Theory of Disability |journal=Hypatia |volume=4 |number=2 |year=1989 |pages=104‚Äì124 |jstor=3809809 |doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1989.tb00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; this also applies to anyone who has any intersectional disadvantages. Feminism identifies these disadvantages and strategizes how to deconstruct the system that supports marginalizing specific groups of people.

=== Social class ===
Within class comes multiple avenues for intersectionality through disability. Disability looks different from a middle class, upper class, and lower class perspective, as well as through race, gender, and ethnicity. One's social class can contribute to when a person becomes disabled, rather it be sooner or later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=F4X6yaiCNOcC&amp;pg=PP2&amp;dq=Feminist,+Queer,+Crip#v=onepage&amp;q=Feminist,%20Queer,%20Crip&amp;f=false|title=Feminist, Queer, Crip|last=Kafer|first=Alison|date=2013-05-16|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0253009418|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, where there is poverty we will find disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2zYEDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Disability+Studies:+An+Interdisciplinary+Introduction#v=onepage&amp;q=Disability%20Studies:%20An%20Interdisciplinary%20Introduction&amp;f=false|title=Disability Studies: An Interdisciplinary Introduction|last=Goodley|first=Dan|date=2016-11-03|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781473986930|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This poverty can include social, economic, and cultural poverty. Having a disability can contribute to poverty just as poverty can contribute to having a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Poverty and Disability: A Survey of the Literature|last=Elwan|first=Ann|publisher=|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with disabilities are more likely to live in poverty and be unemployed than those who do not, resulting in lower socioeconomic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.apa.org/pi/ses/resources/publications/disability.aspx|title=Disability &amp; Socioeconomic Status|last=|first=|date=|website=apa.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

===Questioning the social model===
The International Association of Accessibility Professionals &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies|url=http://www.accessibilityassociation.org/certificationprofoutline|website=International Association of Accessibility Professionals|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognizes six different models for conceptualizing disability: social, medical, cultural affiliation, economic, charity, and functional solutions. Once universally accepted in the field, the '''social''' model of disability &lt;ref name=Models1999 /&gt; has recently{{When|date=January 2018}} been challenged.&lt;ref name="anti-social" /&gt; In a 2014 ''Disability Studies Quarterly'' article, students involved in campus disability groups note that they actively seek cures for their chronic illnesses and "question the rejection of the '''medical''' model" of disability.&lt;ref name=StudentGroups/&gt; The '''cultural affiliation''' model accepts the person's disability completely and uses it a point of pride in being associated with other people in a similar condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro|first1=J|title=No Pity: People with Disabilities Forging a New Civil Rights Movement|date=1994|publisher=Broadway Books.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''economic''' model recognizes the effect of bodily limitations on a person's ability to work, and there may be a need for economic support or accommodations for the person's disability &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strnadov√°|first1=I|last2=Cumming,|first2=Therese|title=Lifespan transitions and disability : A holistic perspective|date=2015|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the '''charity''' model regards people with disabilities as unfortunate and in need of assistance from the outside, with those providing charity viewed as benevolent contributors to a needy population.  The '''functional solutions''' model of disability is a practical perspective that identifies the limitations (or "functional impairments") due to disability, with the intent to create and promote solutions to overcome those limitations. The primary task is to eliminate, or at least reduce, the impact of the functional limitations of the body through technological or methodological innovation. The pragmatism of the functional solution model deemphasizes the sociopolitical aspects of disability, and instead prioritizes inventiveness and entrepreneurship. This is the prevailing opinion behind compliance literature that promotes self-efficacy and self-advocacy skills for people with disabilities preparing for transition to independent living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ocr/transitionguide.html |title=Transition of Students With Disabilities To Postsecondary Education: A Guide for High School Educators |publisher=.ed.gov |date= 2018-09-25|accessdate=2016-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusion of cognitive and mental disabilities===
There is discourse within disability studies to analyze the construction of ''mental illness.'' However, few post-structuralist disability scholars have focused their attention to impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Carol|title=Sociologies of disability and illness : contested ideas in disability studies and medical sociology|date=2007|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-1403936363|page=131|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Carol Thomas, the Reader in Sociology at the Institute for Health Research, [[Lancaster University]], this may be because disability scholars have in the past considered only the barriers confronted by people with physical disabilities.  The experience of impairment, cognitive disability, and mental illness had been absent from the discussion.

It is unclear exactly which perspective of disability scholarship ‚Äúpsychological impairment‚Äù can fall under, and this has led to a hesitation on the part of scholars.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;  Scholars such as [[Peter Beresford]] (2002) suggest "the development of a 'social model of madness and distress'" which would consider impairments of the mind.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt; Yet others may recommend the "embodied approach," to the study of mental illnesses.&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;

[[Image:Skegness4web.jpg|thumb|British seaside donkeys in [[Skegness]], [[Lincolnshire]], used for donkey rides on the beach.]]

'''Donkey rides''' are a traditional feature of [[seaside resort]]s in the [[United Kingdom]]. Children are allowed to ride [[donkey]]s on a sandy [[beach]] for a fee in summer months while on holiday, normally led in groups at walking pace. Typically, the donkeys used to have their names on their [[safety harness|harnesses]] so they could be identified by children and parents alike.

Donkey rides have been available since 1886 in [[Weston Super Mare]] and since 1895 in [[Bridlington]].

The tradition started in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] times, but is now much less popular. It is probable that the donkeys offered to ride on were originally working draught animals in the cockle industries around the coast.

'''Dorico'''({{IPAc-en|Àà|d|…í|r|…™|k|o ä|}}) is a [[scorewriter]] developed and released by [[Steinberg]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]]. Released on 19 October 2016,&lt;ref name="createdigitalmusic_com"/&gt; it was created largely by former developers of the competing product [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]],&lt;ref name="createdigitalmusic_com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rhinegold_co_uk_dorico_2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="musicradar_com_pedigree" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sos"/&gt; who were hired by Steinberg following the closure of [[Avid Technology|Avid]]'s London office in July 2012.&lt;ref name="rpmseattle" /&gt;

The project was first unveiled on the Making Notes blog by Daniel Spreadbury, on 20 February 2013. The program's title ''Dorico'' was revealed on the same blog on 17 May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.steinberg.net/|title=MAKING NOTES|website=MAKING NOTES|language=en-US|access-date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name honours the 16th-century Italian music engraver [[Valerio Dorico]] (1500‚Äìc.1565), who printed first editions of sacred music by [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]] and [[Giovanni Animuccia]]&lt;ref name="rhinegold_co_uk_dorico" /&gt; and pioneered the use of a single impression printing process first developed in England and France.&lt;ref name="uchicago" /&gt;

The integrated built-in tutorial can be helpful to reduce the learning curve of this software for some people.&lt;ref name="ask"/&gt;

{{Music of Sweden}}
"'''{{lang|sv|Du gamla, du fria}}'''" ({{IPA-sv|d âÀê ¬≤…°amÀêla d âÀê ¬≤friÀê.a|-|}}, {{Lang-en|"Thou ancient, Thou free"}}) is the ''de facto'' [[national anthem]] of [[Sweden]]. It was originally named "'''{{lang|sv|S√•ng till Norden}}'''" ({{IPA-sv|Ààs…î≈ãÀê t…™l ÀànuÀê…ñ…õn|pron|}}, "Song to the [[Nordic countries|North]]"), but the [[incipit]] has since been adopted as the title.

==History==
[[File:Du gamla, du fria.ogg|thumb|"Du gamla, du fria" (complete choir version).]]
[[File:Satellite image of Sweden in March 2002.jpg|thumb|upright|The scenery that inspired the lyrics]]
Although the [[Swedish constitution]] makes no mention of a national anthem, "Du gamla, du fria" enjoys universal recognition and is used, for example, at government ceremonies as well as sporting events. It first began to win recognition as a patriotic song in the 1890s, and the issue of its status was debated back and forth up until the 1930s. In 1938, the Swedish public service radio company [[Sveriges Radio]] started playing it at the end of transmitting in the evenings, which marked the beginning of the de facto status as national anthem the song has had since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nationalanthems.me/sweden-du-gamla-du-fria | title=Sweden: Du gamla, Du fria | publisher=NationalAnthems.me | accessdate=2011-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the belief that it was adopted as the national anthem in 1866, no such recognition has ever been officially accorded. A kind of official recognition was when the King [[Oscar II]] rose in honour when the song was played, the first time in 1893. In 2000 the [[Riksdag]] committee rejected, as "unnecessary", a proposal to give the song legally official status, repeated later. The committee concluded that the song has been established as anthem by the people, not by the political system, and that it is good to keep it that way.

[[File:Richard Dybeck.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Richard Dybeck wrote the original lyrics in 1844.]]
The original lyrics were written by [[Richard Dybeck]] in 1844, to the melody of a variant of the ballad ''K√§restans d√∂d''.  The ballad type is classified as D&amp;nbsp;280 in [[The Types of the Scandinavian Medieval Ballad]]; the variant from [[V√§stmanland]] that Dybeck reproduced is classified as [[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader|SMB]]&amp;nbsp;133&amp;nbsp;G.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sveriges Medeltida Ballader]], Vol. 4:1, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;  It was recorded by Rosa Wretman in the beginning of the 1840s. Dybeck published the traditional text in ''Folk-lore I'', and the melody in 1845 in his ''Runa'', where he also published his new text "S√•ng till Norden" ["Song to/of the North"].

Dybeck himself originally wrote the beginning as "Du gamla, du friska" ({{Lang-en|"Thou ancient, Thou hale"}}), but in the late 1850s personally changed the lyrics to "Du gamla, du fria" (Thou ancient, Thou free). The song was already published in several song books and sung with "Du gamla, du friska", but a priest who had known Dybeck got the opportunity to tell the singer most associated with the song, opera singer [[Carl Fredrik Lundqvist]], about the change in the year 1900. From that point on, printings of the "friska" version ceased to be seen in song books, but a recording from 1905 where it is sung with "friska" still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cylinders.library.ucsb.edu/search.php?queryType=@attr%201=1016&amp;query=Arvid+Asplund&amp;num=1&amp;start=2&amp;sortBy=&amp;sortOrder=ia|title=Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project|last=Collections.|first=University of California, Santa Barbara. Library. Department of Special|date=2005-11-16|website=cylinders.library.ucsb.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Swedish composer [[Edvin Kallstenius]] made an orchestral arrangement of the national anthem in 1933.&lt;ref name="Holm" /&gt;

By the early 20th century, many regarded the song unsuitable as a national anthem. In the 1890s it started getting printed in song books in the section for patriotic songs, but as late as in the 1920s it was occasionally published just as "folk music". In 1899 a contest was held for writing a national anthem. It led to [[Verner von Heidenstam]] writing his "Sverige", but did not lead to any new national anthem.

[[Patriotism|Patriotic]] sentiment is notably absent from the text of the original two verses,{{Dubious|date=February 2011}} due to them being written in the spirit of [[Scandinavism]] popular at the time (''Norden'' in general refers to the [[Nordic countries]] in Swedish, Norwegian and Danish). After the song started to acquire its informal status as the national anthem, various people wrote additional verses to increase the "Swedishness" of the song.  The aforementioned Lundqvist wrote his own third verse beginning with "Jag √§lskar dig Sverige" (I love thee, Sweden), [[Frans √ñsterblom]] wrote four verses beginning with "Jag √§lskar min hembygd" ("I love my native area") and [[Louise Ahl√©n]] in 1910 wrote two verses.{{cn|date=February 2013}}

'''Ethnoecology''' is the [[scientific method|scientific]] study of how different groups of people living in different locations understand the [[ecosystem]]s around them, and their relationships with surrounding environments.

It seeks valid, reliable understanding of how we as humans have interacted with the environment and how these intricate relationships have been sustained over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mHj3RfaLCFYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=ethnoecology&amp;ots=xsl7-Ob-kj&amp;sig=gkKc38x93_fuB0S3Bo9IDTKwRvw#v=onepage&amp;q=ethnoecology&amp;f=false|title=Ethnoecology: Situated Knowledge/located Lives|last=Nazarea|first=Virginia D.|date=1999-01-01|publisher=University of Arizona Press|isbn=9780816523641|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ethno" (see [[ethnology]]) prefix in ethnoecology indicates a localized study of a people, and in conjunction with [[ecology]], signifies people's understanding and experience of environments around them. Ecology is the study of the interactions between living organisms and their environment; enthnoecology applies a human focused approach to this subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IryOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;lpg=PA200&amp;dq=latin+morpeme+ethno&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7nRnF23dRA&amp;sig=LqE5uvdEmUIlTDLCpYAogk8yOo0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRxMjZk7TeAhWaHzQIHawABSMQ6AEwDnoECAIQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20morpeme%20ethno&amp;f=false|title=General Linguistics|last=Robins|first=R. H.|date=2014-05-12|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317887638|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the field lies in applying indigenous knowledge of [[botany]] and placing it in a global context.

== History ==
Ethnoecology began with some of the early works of Dr. [[Hugh Popenoe]], an agronomist and tropical soil scientist who has worked with the University of Florida, the National Science Foundation, and the National Research Council. Popenoe has also worked with Dr [[Harold Conklin]], a cognitive anthropologist who did extensive linguistic and ethnoecological research in Southeast Asia. &lt;sup&gt;[&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[Wikipedia:Citation needed|''citation needed'']]]&lt;/sup&gt;

In his 1954 dissertation "The Relation of the Hanunoo Culture to the Plant World", Harold Conklin coined the term ethnoecology when he described his approach as "ethnoecological". After earning his PhD, he began teaching at Columbia University while continuing his research among the Hanunoo.

In 1955, Conklin published one of his first ethnoecological studies. His "Hanunoo Color Categories" study helped scholars understand the relationship between classification systems and conceptualization of the world within cultures. In this experiment, Conklin discovered that people in various cultures recognize colors differently due to their unique classification system. Within his results he found that the Hanunoo uses two levels of colors. The first level consists of four basic terms of colors:; darkness, lightness, redness, and greenness. While, the second level was more abstract and consisted of hundreds of color classifications such as: texture, shininess, and moisture of objects also were used to classify objects.

Other anthropologists had a hard time understanding this color classification system because they often applied their own idea of color criteria to those of the Hanunoo. Conklin's studies were not only the breakthrough of ethnoecology, but they also helped develop the idea that other cultures conceptualize the world in their own terms, which helped to reduce ethnocentric views of those in western cultures. Other scholars such as [[Brent Berlin|Berlin]], Breedlove, and Raven endeavored to learn more about other systems of environment classifications and to compare them to [[Taxonomy (biology)|Western scientific taxonomies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prado|first=Helbert Medeiros|last2=Murrieta|first2=Rui S√©rgio Sereni|last3=Prado|first3=Helbert Medeiros|last4=Murrieta|first4=Rui S√©rgio Sereni|date=2015-12|title=ETHNOECOLOGY IN PERSPECTIVE: THE ORIGINS, INTERFACES AND CURRENT TRENDS OF A GROWING FIELD|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S1414-753X2015000400009&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|journal=Ambiente &amp;amp; Sociedade|volume=18|issue=4|pages=139‚Äì160|doi=10.1590/1809-4422ASOC986V1842015|issn=1414-753X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

[[Ethnoscience]] emphasizes the importance of how societies make sense of their own reality. In order to understand how cultures perceive the world around them, like the classification and organization of the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001/acref-9780199754670|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9780199754670|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199754670.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ethnoecology borrows methods from linguistics and cultural anthropology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lehigh.edu/~dac511/pages/research/ethnoecol.html|title=Ethnoecology, David Casagrande|website=www.lehigh.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Ethnoecology is a major part of an anthropologist‚Äôs toolkit; ¬†it helps researchers understand how the society conceptualizes their surrounding environment i and that it can determine what the society considers "worth attending to" in their ecological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/864107613|title=An ethnoecological approach to the study of a village Himachal Pradesh|last=Anindita.|first=Ghosh,|date=2012|publisher=LAP LAMBERT Academic Publishing|isbn=9783659305320|edition=1. Aufl|location=Saarbr√ºcken|oclc=864107613}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information can ultimately be useful for other approaches used in [[environmental anthropology]].

Ethnoecology is a field of [[environmental anthropology]], and has derived much of its characteristics from classic as well as more modern theorists. [[Franz Boas]] was one of the first anthropologists to question [[unilineal evolution]], the belief that all societies follow the same, unavoidable path towards [[Western civilization]]. Boas strongly urged anthropologists to gather detailed ethnographic data from an [[emic]] standpoint in order to understand different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldman|first=Irving|date=1959|title=Evolution and Anthropology|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3825587|journal=Victorian Studies|volume=3|issue=1|pages=55‚Äì75}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julian Steward]] was another anthropologist whose ideas and theories influenced the use of ethnoecology. Steward coined the term [[cultural ecology]], the study of human adaptations to social and physical environments, and focused on how evolutionary paths in similar societies result in different trajectories instead of the classic global trends in evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php?culture=Ecological%20Anthropology|title=Ecological Anthropology - Anthropological Theories - Department of Anthropology - The University of Alabama|website=anthropology.ua.edu|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new perspective on [[cultural evolution]] was ¬†later named [[multilineal evolution]]. Both Boas and Steward believed that a researcher must use an emic standpoint and that cultural adaptation to an environment is not the same for each society. Furthermore, Steward's cultural ecology provides an important theoretical antecedent for ethnoecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another contributor to the framework of ethnoecology was anthropologist [[Leslie White]]. ¬†White emphasized the interpretation of cultures as [[System|systems]] and laid the foundations for interpreting the intersection of [[Cultural system|cultural systems]] with [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] as well as their integration into a coherent whole. Altogether, these anthropologists, established the foundations of ethnoecology we see today.

== Traditional ecological knowledge ==

[[Traditional Ecological Knowledge]] (TEK), also known as [[Indigenous Knowledge]], "refers to the evolving knowledge acquired by indigenous and local peoples over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/traditional-knowledge.html|title=Fish and Wildlife Service - Native American Liaison|last=Service|first=U.S. Fish and Wildlife|website=www.fws.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the accumulated knowledge, beliefs, and practices widely held by a specific community through their relationship with the environment. In this context, TEK consists of a community‚Äôs shared ideas when considering subjects such as the acceptable uses of plants and animals, the best approach to maximizing the potential uses of land, the social institutions in which members of society are expected to navigate, and holistically, their [[worldview]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|last2=Folke|first2=Mina Kislalioglu, Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav|date=1998-09-01|title=Minireviews: Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs100219900034|journal=Ecosystems|language=en|volume=1|issue=5|pages=409‚Äì415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034|issn=1432-9840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of TEK frequently includes critiques of the theoretical division between cultural systems and ecosystems, interpreting humans as an integral part of the whole.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Humans, for example, can represent a [[keystone species]] in a given ecosystem and can play critical roles in creating, maintaining, and sustaining it . They can contribute to processes such as [[pedogenesis]], [[seed dispersal]], and fluctuations in [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Biodiversity, Resilience and Sustainability|date=1994|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|work=Biodiversity Conservation: Problems and Policies|pages=269‚Äì287|publisher=Springer Netherlands|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-94-011-1006-8_15|isbn=9780792331407|access-date=2018-11-05|last2=Folke|first2=Carl|last3=Gadgil|first3=Madhav}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can also modify and condition [[Ethology|animal behavior]] in either wild or domesticated species.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Traditional Ecological Knowledge has traditionally focused on what Western science can learn from these communities and how closely their cultural knowledge mirrors scientific structures.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been argued that this previous understanding of ecological adaptation could have major influences on our ecological actions in the future. 

==Local knowledge in western society==

Within the discipline of Ethnoecology, there is a clear emphasis on those societies that are deemed "[[indigenous peoples|indigenous]]," "[[traditional]]," or "[[Noble savage|savage]]," a common trend in anthropological pursuits through the 20th century.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | first = Nora
 | year = 2000
 | title = Biodiversity Is Diversity in Use: Community-Based Conservation in the Calakmul Biosphere Reserve
 | journal = America Verde Working Papers
 | volume = 7
 | pages = 5
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, societies exist within a wide range of biomes, and have needs to know and understand clear and present dangers beyond those of harmful plants or how to get the best crop.&lt;ref name="haenn_calakmul" /&gt;  Cruikshank contends that this may because many see Traditional Ecological Knowledge as a "static, timeless, and hermetically sealed" notion.&lt;ref name="cruikshank_glaciers"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Glaciers Listen? : Local Knowledge, Colonial Encounters, and Social Imagination|last=Cruikshank|first=Julie|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2005|location=Seattle|pages=9}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;  Locked within time and space, there is no opportunity to innovate, and is therefore not found within the very new structures of a [[post-industrial society]], such as that of the United States.

In this way, ethnoecologies may exist without the bounded notion of the ''other''.  For example, social scientists have attempted to understand the markers inner-city youth use to identify a threat to their livelihood, including the wearing of gang colors, tattoos, or protrusions through clothes that may represent or be a weapon.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty"&gt;{{Cite journal

 | publisher = College of Human Ecology
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, concepts are spread about the health and needs of the community as they are related to the area around them.  Instilled with recognizing dangers at an early age, and who these threats come from, a set of beliefs are held by the members of the society on how to live in their country, city, or neighborhood.  This broadening of the discipline (bordering on [[human ecology]]) is important because it identifies the environment as not just the plants and animals, but also the humans and technologies a group of people have access to.

Similarly, social scientists have begun to use ethnoecological surveys in ethnographic studies in attempts to understand and address topics relevant in Western society as well as prevalent around the world.&lt;ref name="mathios_poverty" /&gt; This includes researching the ways in which people view their choices and abilities in manipulating the world around them, especially in their ability to subsist.

== Traditional Medicine ==
Traditional societies often treat medical issues through the utilization of their local environment. For example, in Chinese herbal medicine people consider how to utilize native plants for healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nccih.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/chinesemed.htm|title=Traditional Chinese Medicine: In Depth|website=NCCIH|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost 80% of the world‚Äôs population utilizes ethnobotanical methods as a main source of treatment for illnesses, according to WHO.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Farnsworth|first=Norman R.|last2=Akerele|first2=Olayiwola|last3=Bingel|first3=Audrey S.|last4=Soejarto|first4=Djaja D.|last5=Guo|first5=Zhengang|date=1985|title=Medicinal plants in therapy |journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=63|issue=6|pages=965‚Äì981 |pmc=2536466|pmid=3879679}}&lt;/ref&gt; ¬†In the face of modern climate change, many traditional medicinal practices have been promoted for their environmental sustainability&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1995-02-01|title=Ecology and ethnomedicine: Exploring links between current environmental crisis and indigenous medical practices|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0277953694E0098D|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=321‚Äì329|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(94)E0098-D|issn=0277-9536}}&lt;/ref&gt;, such as Ayurveda from India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rastogi|first=Sanjeev|last2=Kaphle|first2=Krishna|date=2011|title=Sustainable Traditional Medicine: Taking the Inspirations from Ancient Veterinary Science|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2011/151435/|journal=Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine|language=en|volume=2011|pages=1‚Äì6|doi=10.1093/ecam/nen071|issn=1741-427X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemological concerns==

According to Dove and Carpenter, "environmental anthropology sits astride the [[dichotomy]] between nature and culture, a conceptual separation between categories of nature, like wilderness and parks, and those of culture, like farms and cities.".&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is inherent in this ideology that humans are a polluting factor violating a previously pristine locale.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

This is especially relevant due to the role in which scientists have long understood how humans have worked for and against their environmental surroundings as a whole.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|year=1998|title=Exploring the Basic Ecological Unit: Ecosystem-like Concepts in Traditional Societies|journal=Ecosystems|volume=1|issue=4|pages=409‚Äì415|doi=10.1007/s100219900034}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  In this way, the idea of a corresponding, but not adversarial, relationship between society and culture was once in itself baffling and defiant to the generally accepted modes of understanding in the earlier half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="berkes_unit" /&gt;  As time went on, the understood dichotomy of nature and culture continued to be challenged by ethnographers such as [[Darrell A. Posey]], John Eddins, Peter Macbeth and Debbie Myers.&lt;ref name="posey_amazonian"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also present in the recognition of indigenous knowledge in the intersection of Western science is the way in which it is incorporated, if at all.  Dove and Carpenter contend that some anthropologists have sought to reconcile the two through a "translation," bringing the ethnological understandings and framing them in a modern dialogue.&lt;ref name="dove_carpenter" /&gt;

In opposition to this paradigm is an attribution to the linguistic and ideological distinctiveness found in the nomenclature and epistemologies.&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This alone has created a subfield, mostly in recognition of the philosophies in [[ethnotaxonomy]].&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology" /&gt;  To define ethnotaxonomy as new or different though, is inaccurate.  It is simply placing a different understanding of a long-held tradition in ethnology, discovering the terms in which different peoples use to describe their world and worldviews.&lt;ref name="gragson_ethnoecology" /&gt;  It is worth noting that those who seek to use and understand this knowledge have actively worked to both enfranchise and disenfranchise the societies in which the information was held.&lt;ref name="haenn_conservatism"&gt;{{Cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Haenn has noted that in several instances of working with conservationists and developers, there was a concerted effort to change the ideas of environment and ecology held by the native groups to the land, while plundering any and all texts and information on the resources found there, therefore enabling a resettlement of the land and redistribution of the knowledge, favoring the outsiders.&lt;ref name="haenn_conservatism" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12433">'''Ethnofiction''' is a [[neologism]] which refers to an [[ethnographic]] [[docufiction]], a blend of [[documentary]] and [[fictional film]] in the area of [[visual anthropology]]. It is a film type in which, by means of [[fictional]]  [[narrative]] or creative [[imagination]], often improvising, the portrayed characters ([[Indigenous peoples|natives]]) play their own roles as members of an [[ethnic]] or social group.

An ethnographer cameraperson, in this view, will be accepted as a natural partner by the actors who play their roles. The cameraperson will be one of them, and may even be possessed by the [[rhythm]] of dancers during a ritual celebration and induced in a state of ''cine-[[trance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cinetrance.com/cine-trance.htm Cine-trance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://der.org/jean-rouch/pdf/American_Anthropologist_Tribute.pdf Cine-trance: a Tribute to Jean Rouch](Visual Anthropology, American Anthropologist)&lt;/ref&gt; Going further than his predecessors, [[Jean Rouch]] introduces the [[actor]] as a tool in research.

A new genre was born.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Rouch and the Genesis of Ethnofiction ‚Äì thesis by Brian Quist (Long Island University)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Flaherty]], a main reference for Rouch, may be seen as the grandfather of this [[genre]], although he was a pure documentary maker and not an ethnographer.

Being mainly used to refer to [[ethnographic]] films as an object of visual anthropology, the term ethnofiction is as well adequate to refer to experimental documentaries preceding and following Rouch's oeuvre and to any [[fictional]] creation in human communication, arts or literature, having an ethnographical or social background.

==History==
Parallel to those of Flaherty or Rouch, ethnic portraits of hard local realities are often drawn in Portuguese films since the thirties, with particular incidence from the sixties to the eighties,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comite-film-ethno.net/colloque-2006/pdf/constructions-identitaires/alves-costa.pdf Imagining Rurality: Portuguese Documentary and Ethnographic Film in the 1960s and 1990s] ‚Äì Abstract for a conference by Catarina Alves Costa at [http://www.comite-film-ethno.net/ Comit√© du Film Ethnographique]&lt;/ref&gt;  and again in the early 21st century.

Arousing fiction in the heart of [[ethnicity]] is something current in the Portuguese popular narrative ([[oral literature]]): in other words, the traditional attraction for [[legend]] and [[surrealistic]] imagery in popular arts&lt;ref&gt;[http://d1113048.dotsterhost.com/The_Portuguese_and_the_others.pdf The Portuguese and the ‚Äúothers‚Äù: dialogue of cultures and characters in oral literary tradition] - Article by Maria Edite Orange and Maria In√™s Pinho at Departamento de Artes e Motricidade Humana do IPP ‚Äì Escola Superior de Educa√ß√£o (Porto)&lt;/ref&gt; inspires certain Portuguese films to strip off realistic predicates and become poetical fiction.

==Cases of note==

===Marillion===
The British rock band [[Marillion]] are considered to be one of the first artists to have truly harnessed the power of the [[internet]] as a means of music distribution and direct contact with fans, which began with setting up a website in 1996 and raising $60,000 to help finance a 1997 North American tour.&lt;ref name="Marillion fans to the rescue"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1325340.stm | title= Marillion fans to the rescue | first=Tim |last=Masters | work=BBC News | date=2001-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' music journalist [[Alexis Petridis]] as "the undisputed pioneers" of the fan-funded music model,&lt;ref name="This song was brought to you by ..."&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/18/popandrock.alexispetridis | title= This song was brought to you by ... | work=The Guardian | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=18 April 2008 | accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; beginning with the distribution of their 2001 release ''[[Anoraknophobia]]''. Amidst a dissolving relationship with their record label and management team, the band calculated that they would need 5,000 fans to order the album to finance the project.  However, they needed the money up-front, before the record was released.  They turned to their mailing list and asked fans to pre-order the album in what was later described by the [[BBC]] as "a unique funding campaign".&lt;ref name="Marillion fans to the rescue"/&gt; Pre-sales well exceeded their 5,000-unit target (reaching about 12,000 pre-sales total).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music4point5.com/blog/the-marillion-story-and-what-we-can-all-learn-from-it/ The Marillion story and what we can all learn from it - Music 4.5&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121109142548/http://www.music4point5.com/blog/the-marillion-story-and-what-we-can-all-learn-from-it/ |date=2012-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marillion have since released several other albums based on a fan-funded model, receiving a ¬£360,000 advance for their 15th studio album ''[[Happiness Is the Road]]''.&lt;ref name="This song was brought to you by ..."/&gt;

===Amanda Palmer===
Unofficially dubbed the "queen" of Kickstarter, [[Amanda Palmer]] is an example of one of the most successful fan-funded music campaigns of all time.  On April 30, 2012, Palmer ran a campaign on Kickstarter, with a goal of $100,000 to fund her newest studio album, ''[[Theatre Is Evil]]''.  By the end of May 2012, Palmer had amassed almost $1.2 million, ultimately receiving donations from nearly 25,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandapalmer/amanda-palmer-the-new-record-art-book-and-tour|title=Amanda Palmer: The new RECORD, ART BOOK, and TOUR|work=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By comparison, the average successful project on Kickstarter at the time raised about $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/arts/music/amanda-palmer-takes-connecting-with-her-fans-to-a-new-level.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | title=Amanda Palmer Takes Connecting With Her Fans to a New Level | date=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ellis Paul===
Boston-based singer/songwriter [[Ellis Paul]] is another important case study in the field of fan-funded music.  His 2010 release, The Day After Everything Changed, was funded completely by fan donations.  Instead of using a traditional crowd-funding platform, he adapted the online merchandise platform [[Nimbit]] to his own fan-funding scheme.  Paul set up a tiered donation hierarchy, ranging from the $15 Street Busker level, up to the $10,000 Woody Guthrie level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ellispaul.com/index.php?page=news&amp;display=2339|title=ELLIS PAUL|date=9 July 2008|work=Ellis Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fans received different perks based on the tier at which they donated.  The project proved to be highly successful, with total donations exceeding $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/04/12/lighters_down_checkbooks_up/|title=Musicians and fans join together to get albums made - The Boston Globe|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paul is putting his fan-funding to the test again; he is currently in the midst of fan-funding a new studio album set to release sometime in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellispaul.com/index.php?page=blog&amp;category=&amp;display=5695|title=ELLIS PAUL|date=26 September 2012|work=Ellis Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric Eel Shock===
[[Tokyo]]-based [[garage rock|garage]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Electric Eel Shock]] is another group that has seen some success in the way of fan-funded music. In 2004 they offered a "SAMURAI 100" package, which gave fans the opportunity to secure "guest list for life" status.  The package cost ¬£100 and the band raised ¬£10,000 by selling 100 such packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/10764-wanna-go-vip-electric-eel-shock-ll-show-you-the-way|title=Wanna Go VIP? Electric Eel Shock'll show you the way...|work=DrownedInSound}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
As a business practice, fan-funded music is not without its criticism.  Fan-funded music has gained popularity in the past few years however, money raised through these platforms still is only estimated to make up 1% of the amount spent on albums and tours. Many bands start off with fan funding to finance their initial album but then get signed to a record label. Major labels are signing artists with successful fan funded campaigns using the campaigns as a filter before investing in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/jan/21/fan-funded-model-record-deal | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Helienne | last=Lindvall | title=Behind the music: The fan-funded model that led to a major record deal | date=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other, more well-known bands have used fan funding to distance themselves from their label contracts and manage their own music. There has yet to be a band that has used fan funding to fully finance their career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18788054 | work=BBC News | title=How fan-funding is changing the face of music finance | date=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, ''The Guardian'' journalist [[Gareth McLean]] was scathing of Marillion's pioneering efforts to continue their career without a label by dealing directly with their fans on the Internet, writing: "They have, they explained, decided to eschew the machinations of the record industry in order to be closer to the people. (One suspects that their decision occurred round about the time that the record industry decided to shun Marillion)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/aug/13/tvandradio.television1 | title= In the realm of pretences| author=Gareth McLean| date=13 August 2001|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that artists overestimate the cost of recording an album and dishonestly solicit more money than they need via fan-funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicthinktank.com/blog/an-argument-against-fan-funding.html|title=An Argument Against Fan Funding - MTT - Music Think Tank|work=musicthinktank.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; With advancements in digital technology, recording equipment has become increasingly compact and more affordable. It is no longer a requirement for an artist to need a large recording studio that houses oversized equipment.  This increase in accessibility that the everyday musician has today has made it possible for artists to record their own albums from their homes. Since there are no restrictions for what artists can ask for, it is not unheard of for artists to inflate the expected costs and then keep the extra money as profit.

Critics also point out that the fan-funded music model has turned bands into marketers and sales personnel. Artists must be able to develop personal marketing strategies in order to get the money to even begin working on their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blog/index.php?blog=10&amp;title=the_problem_with_fan_funded_music&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1|title=The Problem With Fan-Funded Music|author=NME.COM|work=nme.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists must put lots of time and effort into creating a campaign that engages their fans and gets them to donate to their project. This can prove difficult for any artist to create a campaign that does not come off as  "[a] shrill and desperate-modern-day pan-handling by entitled go-getters."{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} While fan-funded platforms are accessible for any musician, they have become over-crowded with both artists and anyone with an idea. "For every legitimately exciting pitch there are dozens of musicians, filmmakers and designers pleading for funds to complete ill-conceived projects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443991704577579190431157610|title=The Good, the Bad and the Crowdfunded|author=Erik Sofge|date=18 August 2012|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Running fan-funded campaigns cost bands a large sum of money. They must pay for video production for the video that every campaign has,{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} a producer and an engineer to mix and master their album, and fulfill all of the rewards promised to their fans as well as the shipping on them. Often the money made off these projects ends up going to paying the costs of running a successful fan funded campaign. For example, a large portion of the $1 million that [[Amanda Palmer]] raised went into funding her [[Kickstarter]] project itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2012/11/23/165658174/how-much-does-crowdfunding-cost-musicians|title=How Much Does Crowd Funding Cost Musicians?|date=23 November 2012|work=NPR.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists such as Palmer have huge fan bases to appeal to for money, but for the average artist raising that kind of money isn't a reliable method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicclout.com/contents/article-116-why-i-hate-crowd-funding-by-normandie-wilson.aspx|title=Music Clout|work=musicclout.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MaoriWardanceKahuroa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The haka is a traditional genre of [[MƒÅori culture|MƒÅori dance]]. This painting dates from {{circa|1845}}.]]
The '''haka''' ({{IPAc-en|Àà|h|…ëÀê|k|…ô}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=haka noun |url=https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/haka |work=[[Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary]] |accessdate=25 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; plural ''haka'', in both [[MƒÅori language|MƒÅori]] and [[English language|English]]) is a [[ceremonial dance]] or challenge in [[MƒÅori culture]].{{sfn|Jackson|Hokowhitu|2002|page=70}} It is a posture dance performed by a group, with vigorous movements and stamping of the feet with rhythmically shouted accompaniment. Although commonly associated with the traditional battle preparations of male [[warrior]]s, haka have been performed by both men and women,&lt;ref name="haka.co.nz"&gt;[http://www.haka.co.nz/haka.php ''Haka'' is also the plural form in MƒÅori] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720050544/http://www.haka.co.nz/haka.php/ |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and several varieties of the dance fulfil social functions within MƒÅori culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Haka, Maori dance|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/haka|work=[[Encyclop√¶dia Britannica]] |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Simon|2015}} Haka are performed to [[p≈çwhiri|welcome distinguished guests]], or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions or funerals.

''[[Kapa haka]]'' (performing arts, {{literally|line dance}}) groups are very common in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kapa haka in mainstream schools ‚Äì Affirming MƒÅori students as MƒÅori {{!}} SchoolNews ‚Äì New Zealand |url=https://www.schoolnews.co.nz/2017/11/kapa-haka-in-mainstream-schools-affirming-maori-students-as-maori/ |website=www.schoolnews.co.nz |accessdate=25 June 2018 |language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main MƒÅori performing arts competition, [[Te Matatini]], takes place every two years.{{sfn|DANZ Quarterly|page=6}}

New Zealand sports teams' practice of performing a haka before their international matches has made the haka more widely known around the world. This tradition began with the [[1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team]] tour and has been carried on by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand rugby union team]] ("All Blacks") since 1905.{{sfn|Hunt|2015}} However, this is considered by some MƒÅori to be a form of [[cultural appropriation]].{{sfn|Simon|2015|page=88}}{{sfn|Hokowhitu|2014|page=273}}

==Etymology==
{{See also|Kapa haka}}
{{Wiktionary|haka}}
The group of people performing a haka is referred to as a ''kapa haka'' (''kapa'' meaning ''row'' or ''rank''). The MƒÅori word ''haka'' has cognates in other [[Polynesian languages]], for example: Tongan ''haka'', 'hand action while singing'; Samoan ''sa{{okina}}a'', Tokelau ''haka'', Rarotongan ''{{okina}}aka'', Hawaiian ''ha{{okina}}a'', Marquesan ''haka'', all meaning 'dance'; Mangarevan ''{{okina}}aka'', 'to dance in traditional fashion; dance accompanied by chant, usually of a warlike nature'. In some languages, the meaning is divergent, for example in Tikopia ''saka'' means to 'perform rites in traditional ritual system'. The form reconstructed for Proto-Polynesian is ''*saka'', deriving ultimately from Proto-Oceanic ''*sa≈ãka(g)''.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==History and practice==
[[File:New Zealand Maori Culture 001 (5396249586).jpg|thumb|upright|When performed by men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Haka ‚Äì Ka Mate |url=http://www.themaori.com/maori-haka |website=www.themaori.com |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the haka features protruding of the tongue.]] 
===Origins===

According to KƒÅretu, the haka has been "erroneously defined by generations of uninformed as 'war dances'",{{sfn|KƒÅretu|1993b|page=37}} whereas [[MƒÅori mythology]] places haka as the dance "about the celebration of life".{{sfn|Simon|2013}} According to its creation story, the sun god, [[Tama-nui-te-rƒÅ]], had two wives, the Summer Maid, [[Hine-raumati]], and the Winter Maid, [[Hine-takurua]]. Haka originated in the coming of Hine-raumati, whose presence on still, hot days was revealed in a quivering appearance in the air. This was the haka of [[TƒÅne-rore]], the son of Hine-raumati and Tama-nui-te-rƒÅ.{{sfn|McLintock|1966}}{{sfn|Simon|2015|page=87}} Hyland comments that "[t]he haka is (and also represents) a natural phenomena; on hot summer days, the 'shimmering' atmospheric distortion of air emanating from the ground is personified as 'Te Haka a TƒÅnerore'".{{sfn|Hyland|2015|page=69}}

Jackson and Hokowhitu state, "haka is the generic name for all types of dance or ceremonial performance that involve movement."{{sfn|Jackson|Hokowhitu|2002|page=70}} The various types of haka include ''whakat≈´ waewae'', ''t≈´t≈´ ngƒÅrahu'' and ''peruperu''.{{sfn|McLintock|1966}} The ''t≈´t≈´ ngƒÅrahu'' involves jumping from side to side, while in the ''whakat≈´ waewae'' no jumping occurs. Another kind of haka performed without weapons is the ''ngeri'', the purpose of which was to motivate a warrior psychologically. The movements are very free, and each performer is expected to be expressive of their feelings. ''Manawa wera'' haka were generally associated with funerals or other occasions involving death. Like the ''ngeri'' they were performed without weapons, and there was little or no choreographed movement.{{sfn|McLintock|1966}}

War haka (''{{lang|mi|peruperu}}'') were originally performed by warriors before a battle, proclaiming their strength and prowess in order to intimidate the opposition.{{sfn|Simon|2015|page=88}}  Various actions are employed in the course of a performance, including [[facial expression|facial contortions]] such as showing the whites of the eyes (''{{lang|mi|p≈´kana}}''), and poking out the tongue (''{{lang|mi|whetero}}'', performed by men only&lt;ref name="haka.co.nz"/&gt;), and a wide variety of vigorous body actions such as slapping the hands against the body and stomping of the feet. As well as [[chant]]ed words, a variety of cries and grunts are used. Haka may be understood as a kind of [[symphony]] in which the different parts of the body represent many instruments. The hands, arms, legs, feet, voice, eyes, tongue and the body as a whole combine to express courage, annoyance, joy or other feelings relevant to the purpose of the occasion.{{sfn|McLintock|1966}}

===18th and 19th centuries===
[[File:MaoriWardance.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|19th-century illustration of a haka, {{circa|1890}}]]
The earliest Europeans to witness the haka were invariably struck by its vigour and ferocity.{{sfn|Smith|2014a}} [[Joseph Banks]], who accompanied [[James Cook]] on his first voyage to New Zealand in 1769, later recorded, "The War Song and dance consists of Various contortions of the limbs during which the tongue is frequently thrust out incredibly far and the orbits of the eyes enlargd so much that a circle of white is distinctly seen round the Iris: in short nothing is omittd which can render a human shape frightful and deformd, which I suppose they think terrible."{{sfn|KƒÅretu|1993a|page=22}}

From their arrival in the early 19th century, Christian [[missionaries]] strove unsuccessfully to eradicate the haka, along with other forms of MƒÅori culture that they saw as conflicting with Christian beliefs and practice. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], the leader of the [[Church Missionary Society]] mission in New Zealand, aimed to replace the haka and traditional MƒÅori chants (''waiata'') with [[hymn]]s. Missionaries also encouraged European harmonic singing as part of the process of conversion.{{sfn|Smith|2014a}}

The use of the haka in welcoming ceremonies for members of [[British royal family]] helped to improve its standing among Europeans. [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Prince Alfred]], the [[Duke of Edinburgh]], was the first royal to visit New Zealand, in 1869.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Zealand's first royal visit |url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/page/new-zealands-first-royal-visit |website=nzhistory.govt.nz |publisher=[[Ministry for Culture and Heritage]] |date=9 December 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the Duke's arrival at the wharf in [[Wellington]], he was greeted by a vigorous haka. The ''Wellington Independent'' reported, "The excitement of the Maoris becomes uncontrollable. They gesticulate, they dance, they throw their weapons wildly in the air, while they yell like fiends let loose. But all this fierce yelling is of the most friendly character. They are bidding the Duke welcome."&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;cl=search&amp;d=WI18690413.2.11.1 13 April 1869], ''Wellington Independent'', p. 3. Retrieved on 25 June 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern haka===
[[File:Haka for Lord Ranfurly 1904.jpg|thumb|A group of men and women perform a haka for Governor [[Lord Ranfurly]] at [[Ruatoki]], Bay of Plenty, 1904]]
[[File:E 003261 E Maoris in North Africa July 1941.jpg|thumb|right|[[MƒÅori Battalion]] haka in Egypt, 1941|alt=A squad of men kneel in the desert sand while performing a war dance]]
In modern times, various haka have been composed to be performed by women and even children.&lt;ref name="haka.co.nz"/&gt; Haka are performed for various reasons: for welcoming distinguished guests, or to acknowledge great achievements, occasions or funerals. The [[1888‚Äì89 New Zealand Native football team]] began a tradition by performing the haka during an international tour.{{sfn|Ryan|1993|p=46}} The common use of haka by the national rugby union team ("All Blacks"; since 1905{{sfn|Hunt|2015}}) has made one type of haka familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the All Black haka |url=https://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/history-of-the-all-black-haka/ |publisher=[[Tourism New Zealand]] |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The haka has been a contested source of [[cultural appropriation]]. The 1979 annual "haka party" parade at the [[University of Auckland]] ‚Äì in which engineering students persisted in parodying the haka by painting male genitals on their body and performing with sexually obscene gestures ‚Äì was disrupted by a collection of MƒÅori and Pacific Island students (''He Taua'', or The War Party) headed by [[NgƒÅ Tamatoa]], a prominent MƒÅori activist group. The protesters included [[Hone Harawira]], later a [[Member of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Yvonne |last=Tahana |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10569951 |title=Haka brawl rivals unite to remember |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=2 May 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the engineering students were assaulted, and members of ''He Taua'' were arrested.{{sfn|Walker|2004|page=220‚Äì7}} Their court case in Auckland sparked anti-racism protests outside the courthouse. 

The choreographed dance and chant popularised around the world by the All Blacks derives from "[[Ka Mate]]",&lt;ref name=teara/&gt; a brief haka previously intended for extemporaneous, non-synchronized performance, whose composition is attributed to [[Te Rauparaha]] (1760s‚Äì1849), a war leader of the [[NgƒÅti Toa]] tribe.{{sfn|Jackson|Hokowhitu|2002|page=129}} The "Ka Mate" haka is classified as a ''haka taparahi'' ‚Äì a ceremonial haka. "Ka Mate" is about the cunning ruse Te Rauparaha used to outwit his enemies, and may be interpreted as "a celebration of the triumph of life over death".&lt;ref name=teara&gt;{{cite web|title=Chant composed by Te Rauparaha|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/music/3918/chant-composed-by-te-rauparaha|website=teara.govt.nz|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns were expressed that the authorship and significance of this haka to the NgƒÅti Toa were being lost and that it had "become the most performed, the most maligned, the most abused of all haka",{{sfn|KƒÅretu|1994b|page=68}} and was now "the most globally recognised form of cultural appropriation".{{sfn|Hokowhitu|2014|page=273}} Specific legal challenges regarding the rights of the NgƒÅti Toa to be acknowledged as the authors and owners of "Ka Mate" were eventually settled in agreements between NgƒÅti Toa and the [[New Zealand Government]] and [[New Zealand Rugby Union]], as published in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7882775.stm | work=BBC News | title=New Zealand Maori win haka fight | date=11 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govt.nz/treaty-settlement-documents/ngati-toa-rangatira/ NgƒÅti Toa Rangatira Letter of Agreement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521222630/http://nz01.terabyte.co.nz/ots/LiveArticle.asp?ArtID=1234231829 |date=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
{{Main|Haka in popular culture}}
[[File:Maori dancers.jpg|thumb|A performance by the Kahurangi MƒÅori Dance group, United States.]]

In the 21st century, ''kapa haka'' is offered as a subject in universities, including the study of haka, and is practised in schools and military institutions.{{sfn|Smith|2014b}} In addition to the national [[Te Matatini]] competition,{{sfn|DANZ Quarterly|page=6}} local and regional competitions attract dozens of teams and thousands of spectators.{{sfn|Smith|2014b}}

The All Blacks' use of the haka has become the most widely known, but several other New Zealand [[haka (sports)|sports teams now perform the haka]] before commencing a game. These include the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|national rugby league team]] ("the Kiwis"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burgess |first1=Michael |title=Rugby League: Kiwis perform haka for Liverpool football players |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=12151955 |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=The New Zealand Herald |date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New Zealand men's national basketball team|men's national basketball team]] ("Tall Blacks").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Zealand haka war dance bewilders USA basketball team |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2014/sep/03/new-zealand-basketball-team-perform-haka-team-usa |accessdate=17 November 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lead up to the [[Rugby World Cup]] in 2011, [[flashmob]] haka became a popular way of expressing support for the All Blacks. Some MƒÅori leaders thought it was "inappropriate" and a "bastardisation" of haka,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Maori-leaders-at-odds-over-flash-mob-haka/tabid/1534/articleID/226469/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Maori leaders at odds over flash mob haka| date=20 September 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227003042/http://www.3news.co.nz/Maori-leaders-at-odds-over-flash-mob-haka/tabid/1534/articleID/226469/Default.aspx|archivedate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite its popularity. Sizeable flashmob haka were performed in Wellington&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Wellington-haka-attracts-hundreds/tabid/423/articleID/225039/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Wellington haka attracts hundreds| date=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Auckland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Flash-mob-haka-on-Aucklands-Queen-Street-ahead-of-RWC-opener-All-Blacks-vs-Tonga/tabid/317/articleID/225146/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Flash mob haka on Auckland's Queen Street ahead of RWC opener All Blacks vs Tonga| date=9 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as London, which has a large New Zealander immigrant community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Flashmob-haka-takes-over-Trafalgar-Square/tabid/417/articleID/277172/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ | title= Flashmob haka takes over Trafalgar Square| date=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, a MƒÅori kapa haka group from [[Rotorua]] performed a version of the "[[Gangnam Style]]" dance mixed with a traditional haka in [[Seoul]], celebrating 50 years of diplomatic relations between South Korea and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Maori-take-on-Gangnam-Style-in-Korea/tabid/418/articleID/278704/Default.aspx |work=[[3 News]] | title= Maori take on Gangnam Style in Korea| date=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 December 2014, at the [[2014 Roller Derby World Cup]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], [[Aotearoa Roller Derby|Team New Zealand]] performed a haka on roller skates to the [[Team Australia (roller derby)|Australian Roller Derby team]] before their bout in the quarter finals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=953038331390867&amp;pnref=story |work=Blood and Thunder World Cup Official Facebook | title= Team New Zealand vs Team Australia Haka | date=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Team New Zealand performed a haka before their debut game against [[USA Roller Derby|Team USA]] at the [[2011 Roller Derby World Cup]], on 1 December 2011; however, it was unexpected and the arena music was still playing. It has since become an expected tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGSrnpuLnNg |work=Blood and Thunder World Cup Official Youtube | title= Team New Zealand Haka| date=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Haka performed by non-New Zealand sports teams|American football teams perform the haka]] as a pregame ritual. This appears to have begun at [[Kahuku High &amp; Intermediate School|Kahuku High School]] where  both the student body and local community includes many Polynesian Hawaiians, MƒÅori, Samoans, Tahitians, and Tongans. The [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawaii]] [[Hawaii Rainbow Warriors football|Rainbow Warriors football team]] also adopted the haka as a pregame ritual [[2006 Hawaii Warriors football team|during the 2006 season]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2006 Hawaii Bowl UH over ASU ‚Äì UH Haka|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qdGX-0NWIY|website=YouTube|accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice has spread to a number of other teams; however, this has been criticised as inappropriate and disrespectful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/new-zealanders-outraged-over-awkward-haka-performed-by-arizona-wildcats-college-football-team-20151001-gjypbn.html|title=New Zealanders outraged over awkward haka performed by Arizona Wildcats college football team|last=Sygall|first=David|date=2015-10-01|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11520336|title=Mixed reaction to an American haka|last=Carpenter|first=Cam|date=2015-09-28|work=The New Zealand Herald|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hereafter''''' is a 2010 American [[fantasy]] [[drama film]] directed, co-produced, and scored by [[Clint Eastwood]], written by [[Peter Morgan]], and executive produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar ways{{mdash}}all three have issues of communicating with the dead; [[Matt Damon]] plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a [[Clairvoyance|clairvoyant]], but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; [[C√©cile de France]] plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a [[near-death experience]] during the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]]; and British twins Marcus and Jason (played by [[Frankie and George McLaren]]). [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[Lyndsey Marshal]], [[Jay Mohr]], and [[Thierry Neuvic]] have supporting roles.

Morgan sold the script [[Spec script|on spec]] to [[DreamWorks]] in 2008, but it transferred to [[Warner Bros.]] by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in [[London]], [[San Francisco]], [[Paris]], and [[Hawaii]].

''Hereafter'' premiered as a "Special Presentation" at the [[2010 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 12, 2010. The film was given a [[limited release]] on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story.

==Plot==
{{Plot|film|date=March 2018}}
On assignment in India, French television journalist Marie Lelay is shopping for souvenirs for her lover Didier's children. She finds a stand where a mother and her daughter work; they sell gifts to Marie for a dollar. Didier looks over the balcony and witnesses the [[2004 Indian Ocean tsunami]] coming into shore. It hits as Marie watches from a distance. She grabs hold of the girl and runs away from the shore but is quickly swallowed by the wave. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated by rescuers but is left for dead. She gasps back to life after having a [[Near death experience|near-death experience]] in which she sees a vision of human figures inhabiting a realm of light, among them the silhouettes of the mother and daughter holding hands. Marie and Didier are soon reunited as the disaster subsides and they return to Paris. Marie's experience, however, interferes with her work performance to the point that Didier (who is also her producer) sends her on a leave of absence to write the book they've discussed, which would add to her prestige.

In San Francisco, former professional psychic George Lonegan is persuaded against his wishes to perform a reading for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. A genuine [[Mediumship|medium]] with a gift for communicating with the dead, George abandoned his old career because he was unable to deal with the emotional impact of the reunions and the often disturbingly intimate family secrets revealed. While doing the reading, George hears the word June and asks if a date in June means anything to him. Christos at first denies that it means anything, but privately reveals to Billy that June was the name of his late wife's nurse, whom he was in love with for ten years.

In London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try desperately to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother, Jackie, from losing them to social services. After evading the authorities yet again, the boys' mother sends Jason to the [[chemist]] to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. On the way home, Jason is attacked by street thugs, and while trying to escape, he is hit by a van and killed. No longer able to protect his mother, and barely able to cope with life without the brother he idolizes, Marcus is sent to a foster home.

Now writing a book and with more time to contemplate her near-death experience, Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a renowned specialist in the field. As the director of a hospice who has seen her share of dying patients, the doctor describes herself as a former skeptic who was convinced by the evidence that the afterlife exists and that people like Marie have had a genuine view of it. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience in the hope that the scientific community will ultimately accept the reality of life beyond death.

Desperate for one last reunion with his twin brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and goes around London seeking someone to help him contact Jason. He encounters only frauds and pretenders. While he is trying to board the underground at [[Charing Cross]], Jason's cap, which has become a talisman for Marcus, blows off his head. Delayed by trying to find the cap, he misses his train and sees it explode in the tunnel during the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|2005 London Bombings]].

George enrolls in a cooking class taught by one of San Francisco's leading chefs. Its  students are paired-up, resulting in George being partnered with a young woman named Melanie. The two hit it off and after attending their second class decide to put their new culinary skills to use by preparing an Italian dinner at George's place. All goes well until they hear an ill-timed phone message from his brother, which inclines George to reveal his past as a psychic to Melanie. Curious, she presses George to do a reading for her. George explains his reluctance, but acquiesces. They contact the spirit of Melanie's father, who ends the session by asking her forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees George's home in tears, and she doesn't return to the cooking class.

Having been in talks with a publisher before her trip to Thailand about a biography of [[Fran√ßois Mitterrand]], Marie now stuns them with her new manuscript entitled "''Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence''". The publisher rejects the manuscript but soon steers her toward other publishers who might be interested, the most promising of them in London.

Marie learns from Didier that he does not intend on having her back at the job he urged her to take leave of, because her public interest in the hereafter damages her reputation as a serious journalist, and that he is having an affair with the woman who replaced her on the TV news program.

George is laid off from his factory job, and is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Still heartbroken over the fiasco with Melanie, he changes his mind and impulsively leaves San Francisco to make a new start elsewhere. He travels to London and listens every night to audiobook readings by [[Derek Jacobi]] of [[Charles Dickens]]' works. As a Dickens devotee, he also visits the Dickens Museum and attends Jacobi's live reading of Dickens at the [[London Book Fair]]. There, one of the presenters is Marie, reading her now published book, ''Hereafter''. While handing a signed copy of her book to George, their hands touch and George has a psychic flash of Marie's tsunami drowning.

Marcus and his foster parents are also at the London Book Fair. Asking leave of them, Marcus spots George, someone he has read about and seen online. Marcus attempts to speak with the medium, who brushes him off and returns to his hotel. Marcus follows him, standing outside the hotel until nightfall. Eventually George asks him in and agrees to do his reading.

Through George, Jason tells Marcus that he is happy in the afterlife. He instructs Marcus to stop wearing his cap and says it was he who knocked it off his head at the train station. It was used, he says, to keep Marcus from the doomed train but now he must stand on his own. Jason tells him not to fear this "because we are one". As Marcus leaves George, he says he is sorry about "the French woman" as he could tell that "you like her." The last time we see Marcus, he is visiting his mother in a rehab center. She is visibly better and he is not wearing Jason's cap.

Marcus lets George know where Marie is staying. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie, saying he believes her book to be true. She decides to join the anonymous fan for lunch and discovers George. While she is looking for him, George sees a vision of them kissing at the same meeting. Their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them appreciate this life all the more, George and Marie sit together in the cafe.

[[Peter Morgan]] wrote the script [[Spec script|on spec]], and it was bought by [[DreamWorks]] in March 2008.

Eastwood was attracted to the script because he was keen to direct a supernatural thriller, and liked how Morgan incorporated real-world events into fiction. Eastwood told ''[[LA Weekly]]'', "There's a certain charlatan aspect to the hereafter, to those who prey on people's beliefs that there's some afterlife, and mankind doesn't seem to be willing to accept that this is your life and you should do the best you can with it and enjoy it while you‚Äôre here, and that'll be enough. There has to be immortality or eternal life and embracing some religious thing. I don't have the answer. Maybe there is a hereafter, but I don't know, so I approach it by not knowing. I just tell the story."&lt;ref name=Foundas&gt;Foundas, Scott (December 10, 2009). "[http://www.laweekly.com/2009-12-10/film-tv/eastwood-on-the-pitch/4 Eastwood On The Pitch]".

{{main article|Kolkata}}

Kolkata, [[Indian renaming controversy|formerly known as]] [[Calcutta]] in [[English language|English]], is the capital of the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]] and is located in eastern India on the east bank of the [[River Hooghly]]. The city was a colonial city developed by the [[British East India Company]] and then by the British Empire. Kolkata was the capital of the British Indian empire until 1911 when the capital was relocated to [[Delhi]]. Kolkata grew rapidly in the 19th century to become the second city of the British Empire. This was accompanied by the development of a culture that fused European philosophies with Indian tradition. 

Kolkata is also noted for its revolutionary history, ranging from the [[Indian Independence Movement|Indian struggle for independence]] to the leftist [[Naxalite]] and trade-union movements. Labelled the "Cultural Capital of India", "The City of Processions", "The City of Palaces", and the "City of Joy", Kolkata has also been home to prominent people such as, Raja [[Ram Mohan Roy]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Keshub Chandra Sen]], [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], [[Ramakrishna Paramahamsa]], [[Sarada Devi]], [[Swami Vivekananda]], [[Sister Nivedita]], [[Sri Aurobindo]], [[Subhas Chandra Bose]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri]], [[Paramahansa Yogananda]], [[Anil Kumar Gain]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Jibanananda Das]], [[A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada]], [[Maulana Abul Kalam Azad]], [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Satyajit Ray]], Ustad [[Ali Akbar Khan]], Ustad [[Vilayat Khan]] and Pandit [[Ravi Shankar]]. Problems related to rapid urbanization started to plague Kolkata from the 1930s and the city remains an example of the urbanization challenges of the developing nations.

== Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600‚Äì1700) ==
{{ref improve section|date=August 2016}}
There is a long chain of events behind the arrival of the British [[East India Company]] in Bengal, specifically [[Job Charnock]] in [[Sutanuti]] in 1690. These incidents are documented in numerous records of the [[East India Company]] and by several authors [Bruce 1810 (Vol I and II), Marshman Vol I, Unknown 1829; see references below]. These documents tell the story of how the English were severely beaten and wiped out from Bengal several times by the forces of the Mughal Emperor and how each time they came back to Bengal to continue their trade.

The agents of the East India Company first visited the provinces of [[Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Odisha]], for trade during the period of [[Ibrahim Khan Fath-i-Jang|Ibrahim Khan]] (ca 1617-1624), the [[Subahdar]] (Governor) of Bengal at the time of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Jahangir]]. The first [[factory (trading post)|factory]] was established in Surat in 1620 and later in Agra, and agents were further sent from these places to the eastern provinces to examine the possibility of opening factories there. However the transportation costs and logistics were unfavorable and the plan was abandoned. In January 1644, the daughter of the Emperor was severely burnt and a doctor named Gabriel Boughton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nolan|first1=Edward|title=The illustrated history of the British empire in India and the East vol 3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c0kOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;lpg=PA13&amp;dq=Mr.+Boughton+doctor+India&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FneOds3qkP&amp;sig=cTxDAiPTwNi9LEUNe04KU3dNY-k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiQpdqFiMPOAhUN_mMKHTWXDqEQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mr.%20Boughton%20doctor%20India&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly the surgeon of the [[East Indiaman]] ''Hopewell'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bengal; its chiefs, agents, and governors |last=Danvers|first=Frederick Charles|url=https://archive.org/details/bengalitschiefsa00danvrich|year=1888|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; was sent from Surat for her treatment. 

He was able to successfully treat her burns and in reward the Emperor allowed the company to establish factory at [[Pipili]], Odisha, and for the first time English ships arrived at an eastern port. During 1638, Shah Jahan appointed his son [[Shah Shuja (Mughal)|Shah Shuja]] as the Subahdar of Bengal and Boughton visited the capital at [[Rajmahal]] where his services were again used to treat one of the ladies in the palace, and in return, the company was allowed to establish factories in [[Balasore]], [[Odisha]] and [[Hugli-Chinsura|Hooghly]], [[Bengal]] in addition to [[Pipili]], [[Odisha]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/britishindia00fraziala|title=British India: Story of Nations Series|last=Frazer|first=R.

Putnam|others=University of California Libraries (Digital)|year=1896|isbn=|pages=39-40}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Shaista Khan]] was appointed as the governor of Bengal in around 1664 by Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] and was relieved upon his request in around 1682. While he was returning to Delhi, Englishmen sent with him a request to the Emperor to obtain a special [[firman]] to do business forever in Bengal; the Emperor was pleased to provide them the Firman and the occasion was celebrated with a 300 gun salute at Hooghly. The investment in Bengal soared, the Bengal residency was separated from Madras and [[William_Hedges_(colonial_administrator)|Mr. Hedges]] was appointed as the chief officer to oversee trade in Bengal. His residence in Hooghly was secured with soldiers obtained from Madras. This is the first time English soldiers came on the soil of Bengal. However, the Firman was vague in many aspects and soon disputes started to grow between the English and the governor.

During this time a local disturbance occurred when the [[zamindar]] in Bihar attacked the governor of [[Bihar]]. Mr. Peacock, the chief of the factory in Patna, was imprisoned by the governor with the assumption that he was involved in the dispute. At the same time their [[saltpetre]] trade was disrupted by another rival British company. To protect their trade in Bengal, the original [[East India Company]] requested to build a fort in the mouth of Hooghly or on its banks. This request was immediately turned down by Shaista Khan and a 3.5% tax was imposed in addition to the already existing tax of 3,000 rupees, notwithstanding the Firman obtained earlier. Another incident with the [[Faujdar]] of [[Cossimbazar]] resulted in altercations between the Governor of Bengal and the company causing their ships to leave Bengal without obtaining cargo.

Enraged with this situation and determined to establish their authority, the company requested King James II in 1685 to permit the use of force against the Emperor‚Äôs army to settle the matter. Admiral Nicholson was sent with ships to attack the port at [[Chittagong]], fortify it, make an alliance with the [[List of Arakanese monarchs|King of Arakan]] who was against the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], establish a mint and collect revenue, thus making Chittagong a fort city for the British in the eastern part. Then he was ordered to proceed to Dhaka. It was assumed that the governor would abandon the city and then a peace treaty would be offered which would guarantee free trade and other economic benefits for the British and he would give up the territory of Dhaka and Chittagong. [[Job Charnock]] was then at Madras and was directed to join the expedition with 400 soldiers from the Madras division.

Unfortunately the plan went awry; some of the ships, due to the change in current and wind, arrived at [[Hugli-Chinsura|Hooghly]] instead of [[Chittagong]] and anchored off the factory in Hooghly after being joined by their Madras troops. The presence of a large number of war ships alarmed [[Shaista Khan]] and he immediately offered a truce. However the peace was broken again when some British troops misbehaved with Shaista Khan‚Äôs troops in Hooghly on 28 October 1686 for which the former were severely beaten by the latter. At the same time the admiral opened fire and burnt down 500 houses; property losses were about thirty lacs of rupees. However a truce was again obtained between Mr. Charnock and the local Foujidar, and the English were allowed to put saltpetre on board their ships. However, Shaista Khan upon hearing this ordered the closing and confiscation of all their factories and properties in Bengal and sent a large force to drive out the English from Hooghly.

Upon hearing the news of Shaista Khan‚Äôs plan, Mr. Charnock determined that it was no longer safe to remain in Hooghly and decided to move downstream to [[Sutanuti]], a small hamlet on the banks of the river Hooghly on 20 December 1686. At this time their ships in Bengal required extensive repairs and the remainder of their fleet were considered in danger. In this situation they considered that they would be extremely fortunate if they could hold their current position instead of their desires on Chittagong and for this matter they decided to ask forgiveness from the Emperor and requested to reinstate the previously obtained Firman. 

Peace treaty was again offered by the governor at the end of December 1686 but it was mainly to buy out time for attack and by February 1687 a large troop of Shaista Khan‚Äôs army arrived at Hooghly to drive the British out of Bengal.  Charnock decided it was not safe to remain in Sutanuti and moved to the island village at [[Hijli Kingdom|Hijli]]. There he remained with his soldiers in an utterly inhospitable place full of mosquitoes, snakes and tigers. The Governor‚Äôs troops didn‚Äôt bother them there since they knew the British would not be able to survive long there. In fact, within three months about half of Charnock‚Äôs soldiers died and the remaining half were ready to be hospitalized.

With his back to the wall, Charnock was desperately willing to negotiate with Shaista Khan to get out of this mess. Luck favored him because of an unexpected event. At the time when Nicholson was ordered to proceed to Chittagong, [[Sir John Child, 1st Baronet|Sir John Child]] was ordered to withdraw the company‚Äôs establishment from Bombay, commence hostilities on the western coast, blockade Mughal harbors and attack their ships anywhere to be found. Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] wanted to reconcile with the British to ensure uninterrupted voyage of pilgrims to Mecca and asked his governors to make terms with them. 

As a result, a peace treaty was signed between Shaista Khan and Charnock on 16 August 1687. Shaista Khan allowed them to remain in Bengal, however to be limited only to [[Uluberia]], a small town on the bank of river Hooghly south of Sutanuti, where they were allowed to make a port and do business from there, but their war ships were strictly not allowed to enter Hooghly. Charnock arrived at [[Uluberia]], started making a dock there, however soon started to dislike the place and wanted to return to Sutanuti. At this time the governor asked them to return and settle at Hooghly, ordered them not to build any structure at Sutanuti and asked Charnock to pay a large sum of money for compensation. While not in a position to fight against the Governor‚Äôs troops, two British agents were sent to Dhaka to plead to the governor to allow them to return to Sutanuti and build a fort there.

At the same time, when the news of failure of Nicholson reached England, it was decided that until a fort was built on the bank of the river, the English would never be able to do business with ease and would always be on the mercy of the forces of the governor. For this, [[Captain Heath]] was sent to Bengal with 160 soldiers either to fight and win against the forces of the governor or to bring back all the properties of the company to Madras and abandon the trade in Bengal. Captain Heath arrived in October 1688 in Bengal, took all of company persons on board, set sail to [[Balasore]] on 8 November 1688. He reached Balasore on 29 November, pounded and destroyed the town including their own factory and released some English prisoners from the Governor‚Äôs prison. 

They left Balasore on 13 December for Chittagong, reached there on 17 December, found the Governor‚Äôs fortification too strong to destroy and decided to wait until his demands are answered by the governor. However, instead of waiting for Governor‚Äôs answer, Captain Heath set sail to Arakan, arrived there on 31 January 1689 and offered treaty to the king that English will fight against the Mughals at [[Dhaka]] and the king would provide them settlements in his dominion. When a fortnight passed without any answer from the king, Captain Heath, frustrated and dejected, returned to Madras on 4 March 1689. This was a total failure of English objectives in Bengal during the early period of 1689 which caused them abandoning Bengal as their trading location in eastern region.

Emperor Aurangzeb, enraged with the situation that the British fortified in Madras, occupied territory around it, captured Mughal ships, went into alliance with his enemy [[Sambhaji]], he ordered his commanders everywhere in India to exterminate British from the country and seize their properties anywhere to be found. Warehouses in [[Visakhapatnam]] were destroyed and many English men were captured and put to death. Shaista Khan went after them in Dhaka, captured them and put them behind bars.

Shaista Khan retired from his duty as governor in ca 1689 and [[Ibrahim Khan II|Ibrahim Khan]] was appointed as the new governor of Bengal by Emperor Aurangzeb. By this time Aurangzeb was camping at Visapur and was much aware of the fact that he was losing revenues from the British trade and the British ships could cause him much trouble by stopping the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] since they controlled the sea-route. At the same time, the British were desperate to open negotiations with the Emperor after they left Bengal and Mr. Child was sent to him. He decided to accept the offer and ordered the Governor of Bengal to allow British to return there. 

As a result, Ibrahim Khan invited Mr. Charnock back to Bengal; but Mr. Charnock refused to come back until a specific Firman with terms and conditions clearly specified was issued by the Emperor so that they would not be subjected to further humiliations. Ibrahim Khan again sent letter to Mr. Charnock explaining that he had requested for the special Firman from the Emperor and it would take a few months before it arrived, and in the mean time Mr. Charnock was welcome to settle in Bengal and the governor would pay him 80,000 rupees for the goods that have been destroyed by Shaista Khan‚Äôs regime. 

With this friendly invitation, Mr. Job Charnock with 30 soldiers returned to Sutanuti on 24 August 1690 and hoisted the Royal Standards of England on the banks of river Hooghly, thus beginning a new era of British involvement in Bengal. In the next year, Ibrahim Khan sent the order from the Emperor to Mr. Charnock which allowed unrestricted trade without paying any other taxes except the usual 3,000 rupees.

Mr. Charnock died in January 1692. While the English were always looking for fortification of their factories in Bengal, Ibrahim Khan never allowed them to do so. In 1695 the town of Hooghly was seized by [[Sobha Singh (general)|Sobha Singh]] along with an unknown Afghan Rahim Khan, and the English at Sutanuti requested from the governor to use their own armed protection for their factories when their factories were surrounded by the enemy. 

Ibrahim Khan allowed them to protect their own factories, but did not allow any fortification explicitly. However, in the absence of specific orders the permission to defend their property was taken as a permit to build fortress and construction began immediately overnight with all available manpower. The fort was built on the bank of river Hooghly at Sutanuti with mortar brought from Madras, completed in ca 1701 and was called [[Fort William (India)|Fort William]] after King [[William III of England]]. This was the old Fort William and construction for a new one (the present one) started after [[Siraj ud-Daulah|Siraj Ud-Daulah]] attacked Fort William in 1756.

In 1690, Job Charnok, an agent of the East India Company chose this place for a British trade settlement. The site was carefully selected, being protected by the Hooghly River on the west, a creek to the north, and by salt lakes about two and a half miles to the east. There were three large villages along the east bank of the river Ganges, named, Sutanuti, Gobindapur and Kalikata. These three villages were bought by the British from the local land lords. The Mughal emperor granted East India Company freedom of trade in return for a yearly payment of 3,000 rupees.

== Origins ==
=== Name === &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[CALCUTTA--&gt;
{{main article|Etymology of Kolkata}}
The rent-roll of [[Akbar]], the 16th century [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor, and the work of a Bengali poet, [[Bipradas Pipilai]], of the late 15th century, both make mention of the city's early name's being ''Kolikata'', from which Kolkata/Calcutta derive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9821/Calcutta Britannica entry]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much discussion about the origin of the city's name. The most accepted view is that it comes from the Hindu goddess [[Kali]] and the original name was ''KaliKshetra'', "the place of Kali".

Other theories include:
* The name comes from the location of the original settlement beside a ''khal'' ("canal" in [[Bengali language|Bengali]])
* The place was known for its manufacture of shell-lime, the name deriving from ''kali'' ("lime") and ''kata'' ("burnt shell")
* The name is derived from the Bengali  ''kilkila'' ("flat area"), which is mentioned in the old literature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calcuttaweb.com/history.shtml Calcuttaweb article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510193408/http://www.calcuttaweb.com/history.shtml |date=2007-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The name came into being when Job Charnock asked a farmer the name of the area around Hooghly River. The farmer misunderstood due to language problems and thought that he was referring as to when he harvested his paddy. He proudly replied "'''''Kal Kaata''' hoe chhilo''" meaning "I cut it yesterday." Job Charnock thought that the name of the place is Calcutta.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The area where the city is now located was originally inhabited by the people of three villages: ''[[Kalikata]]'', ''[[Sutanuti]]'' and ''[[Gobindapur, India|Gobindapur]]''. However, the boundaries of the three villages gradually became less distinct, and before the [[battle of Plassey]], the city could be divided into four different sub-areas: European Kolkata (Dihi Kolkata); a residential village with some sacred spots (Gobindapur); a traditional Indian market (Bazar Kalikata or Burrabazar); and a riverine mart concentrating on cloth trade (Sutanati).&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Dr. S.C. 1991. The Changing Face of Calcutta: An Architectural Approach. Government of West Bengal&lt;/ref&gt; After the battle of Plassey in 1757, the British started rebuilding the city with the idea of making it the capital for their empire.

The [[Calcutta High Court]] ruled in 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Subhrangshu | last=Gupta| authorlink =| author=| coauthors =| title =Job Charnock not Kolkata founder: HC Says city has no foundation day| url =http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030518/nation.htm#3| work=| publisher=[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] online edition| pages=| page=| date=17 May 2003| accessdate=2006-12-17| quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Job Charnock]], the Englishman generally believed to be the founder of the Calcutta, is not the founder of the city and that hence Kolkata has no birthday. According to the Court, the city has its genesis in the [[Maurya Empire|Maurya]] and [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] period and it was an established trading post long before the Slave Dynasty of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], the [[France|French]] or the [[United Kingdom|British]] established a modern township there.

The [[British East India Company]] chose the place for a trade settlement. In 1698, the East India Company bought three villages (Sutanuti, Kalikata and Gobindapur) from a local landlord family of [[Sabarna Roy Choudhury]]. The next year, the company began developing the city as a [[Presidency City]]. In 1727, on the order of [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], a civil court was set up in the city. The Calcutta Municipal corporation (now renamed [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]]) was formed and the city had its first [[mayor]].

=== Journey from British rule to independence ===
The three villages, in particular ''Kalikata'', where Calcutta is located, came into the possession of the [[British East India Company]] in 1690 and some scholars like to date its beginnings as a major city from the construction of [[Fort William, India|Fort William]] by the [[United Kingdom|British]] in 1698, though this is debated (see the court ruling in "Name and origins" above).  From 1772 to 1911, Calcutta was the capital of British India.  From 1912 to India's Independence in 1947, it was the capital of all of [[Bengal]].  After Independence, Calcutta remained the capital of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].

=== The fall of Calcutta to Siraj ud-Daula ===

{{See also|Robert Clive|Bengal Presidency}}

When the [[Seven Years' War]] broke out, owing to their constant rivalry with the [[French East India Company|French]], and the fall of [[Madras]] to the forces of [[Joseph Fran√ßois Dupleix|Dupleix]], early in 1756 the British authorities in Calcutta began repairs to the fortifications of old [[Fort William, India|Fort William]], which were extremely decayed. This irritated the new [[Nawab of Bengal]], [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], who viewed it as a threat to his sovereignty. Enraged still further when the British granted asylum to one Krishnaballav, who had embezzled money from the ''dewani'' of [[Dhaka]], Siraj ud-Daula first attacked and captured [[Cossimbazar]] (taking as hostage [[William Watts]] and [[Begum Johnson]]), and then Calcutta, which fell after a short siege on 20 June 1756, during which the governor and many other officials escaped down the [[Hooghly River]], leaving the remainder of the garrison and the [[Anglo-Indian|Eurasian]] population of Calcutta to their fate. 

This is now known as the [[Siege of Calcutta]]. It is said that 123 Britons later died in the [[Black Hole of Calcutta]] after his victory, but recent evidence calls into question the numbers involved, and suggests that the Nawab himself was probably unaware of what transpired. He renamed Calcutta Alinagar after the previous Nawab, and his maternal grandfather, [[Alivardi Khan]]. Having installed Manikchand as the ruler of Alinagar, Siraj returned to [[Murshidabad]]. Soon (on 2 January 1757) Watson and [[Robert Clive]] retook Calcutta with a force of company [[sepoys]] and the assistance of the [[Royal Navy]]. Hearing the news, Siraj ud-Daula moved to attack Calcutta, but fearing an attack from [[Ahmad Shah Abdali]], after a few days of war he signed the [[Treaty of Alinagar]] with the East India Company, giving them permission to build the fort.

Although Siraj ud-Daula conceded temporary defeat in the Pact of Alinagar, he once again began scheming with the French against the British. Meanwhile, the [[Third Carnatic War]] was starting in the south. Also at this time, nobles such as [[Jagat Seth]], [[Mir Jafar]], Rai Durlav, Omichand and Rajballav were plotting against Siraj ud-Daula (a principal reason being the Nawab's arrogance, well attested to in contemporary sources)&lt;ref&gt;Ghulam Husain Salim ''Riyazu-s-Salatin. A History of Bengal'' Ed. &amp; Trans. Maulavi Abdus Salam (Calcutta: Baptist Mission Press) 1902 Fasc. IV&lt;/ref&gt; and they invited Clive to take part in their plans. 

Clive seized on this plan to get rid of two enemies at once. Citing non-existent reasons, he attacked [[Murshidabad]], having previously reached an agreement with Mir Jafar to install him on the ''musnud'' of Bengal. On the fateful day of 23 June 1757, 23 miles away from Murshidabad in the mango groves of [[Palashi]], the armies met at the [[Battle of Plassey]]. The British army consisted of 800 European soldiers and 2,200 Indian soldiers, while the Nawab's army was made up of 18,000 cavalry and 50,000 infantry. At the start of this seemingly impossible battle, generals Rai Durlav and Iar Latif held their armies together, but in an act of treachery [[Mir Jafar]] led his troops away from the battlefield, and the remaining army led by Mirmadan and Mohanlal was defeated. 

Siraj ud-Daula escaped but was later caught and killed by Miran, the son of Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar was made the new Nawab, and the British had effectively seized control of Bengal. In 1765, after defeating the next Nawab, [[Mir Qasim]], the [[Nawab of Oudh]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Emperor]] at the [[Battle of Buxar]], there was no one to stand in the way of the British and their dominance in North India. Thus, British imperialism began in India with the conquest of Bengal, a game in which a main pawn was the great city of Calcutta.

Calcutta also had an indirect but important influence on the battles of the [[Carnatic Wars]]. When Madras fell to Dupleix, the British were still able to direct the war from another of their strongholds, Calcutta. They also used the wealth of Bengal to defeat the French. As Dr. [[R. C. Majumdar]] stated in ''An Advanced History of India'', "The Battle of Plassey may be truly said to have decided the fate of the French in India."

=== 18th century scandals ===

One of the most notorious incidents of the latter part of the century was the trial and execution of [[Maharaja Nandakumar|Nanda Kumar]],  who had been the governor of [[Hugging-Coinsurance|Hugging]] in 1756. In 1764 he had been appointed collector of [[Burdwan]] in place of [[Warren Hastings]], which resulted in a long-standing enmity between the two men. In 1775, when Hastings was [[Governor-General]], Nanda Kumar brought accusations of corruption against him, accusing him of accepting bribes and other abuses of power. These were taken up with enthusiasm by Hastings' rivals on the Governor General's Council, led by [[Philip Francis (English politician)|Philip Francis]]. Whilst this matter was still awaiting investigation Nanda Kumar was indicted for forgery of a deed, condemned and executed. There was a strong suspicion that the charges had been invented by Hastings, and that he had put pressure on the judges to pass sentence of death. At this date it was far from clear whether or not English law applied in Calcutta, and it was extremely rare for the death penalty to be applied for forgery even in England. Furthermore, Nanda Kumar was a [[Brahman]], and his hanging caused widespread dismay and outrage in Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;''The Memoirs of William Hickey'' (London: Hurst &amp; Blackett) Vol.II (1918) pp154-5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Warren Hastings and Sir [[Elijah Impey]], the Chief Justice, were both impeached, and were accused by [[Edmund Burke]] and afterwards by [[Thomas Babington Macaulay, 1st Baron Macaulay|Thomas Babington Macaulay]] of committing a judicial murder.&lt;ref&gt;H.E. Busteed ''Echoes of Old Calcutta'' (Calcutta) 1908 pp73-106; H. Beveridge ''The Trial of Nanda Kumar''&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after this incident, in 1780, relations between Warren Hastings and Philip Francis deteriorated to such an extent that the two fought a duel in the grounds of Belvedere (now the National Library) on the road to the suburb of [[Alipore]]. Francis was severely wounded, but Hastings escaped unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;Busteed ''Old Calcutta'' pp107-117&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Opium trade ===
After the territorial conquest of Bengal in 1757, the [[British East India Company]] pursued a monopoly on production and export of opium from India. The company bought opium from local traders and later directly from farmers, and sold it at auction in Calcutta. From there much of it was smuggled to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in [[China]] by foreign traders, eventually leading to the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842).

== Social and intellectual life in the 18th century ==
In 1772, Calcutta became the capital of [[British India]], a decision made by [[Governor General]] [[Warren Hastings]]. On 29 January 1780, ''[[Hickey's Bengal Gazette]]'' or ''the Calcutta General Advertiser'' became the first newspaper to be printed in India, and is an invaluable chronicle of the social life of Anglo-Indian society in Calcutta. Contemporary memoirs such as those of [[William Hickey (memoirist)|William Hickey]] record the consumption of enormous meals, washed down by copious quantities of claret, port, madeira and other wines, followed by the smoking of [[Hookah]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Memoirs of William Hickey'' (London: Hurst &amp; Blackett) Vol.II (1918) pp136-7 Vol. III (1923) pp205-6, 234-5; [[Percival Spear]] ''The Nabobs'' (Delhi: OUP) 1998 p36&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of his English wife, Charlotte, (who is buried in [[Park Street Cemetery]]) Hickey married a Bengali girl called Jemdanee, who died in childbirth in 1796, prompting him to write in his journal that "Thus did I lose as gentle and affectionately attached a girl as ever man was blessed with".&lt;ref&gt;''Memoirs of William Hickey'' (London: Hurst &amp; Blackett) Vol. IV (1925) p141&lt;/ref&gt; 

Such unions between Europeans, English, French and Portuguese, and local women, both Hindu and Muslim, were common throughout the 18th century in Calcutta, and are the origin of the city's substantial Anglo-Indian (or Eurasian) community today: by the early 19th century, however, increasing racial intolerance made marriages of this kind much rarer.

Calcutta's intellectual life received a great boost in 1784 with the foundation of the [[Asiatic Society of Bengal]] by [[William Jones (philologist)|Sir William Jones]], with the encouragement of [[Warren Hastings]], himself no mean Oriental scholar. Jones worked closely with the ''[[pandit]]s'' of the [[Kalighat|Kalighat Temple]], together with the local ''[[ulema]]'', in translating and producing new editions of rare and forgotten texts. His study of [[Sanskrit]] with [[Pandit Ramlochan]] at [[Nadia district|Nadiya]] led him to posit the existence of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] family of languages. Many distinguished scholars, English and Bengali, such as [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke]], [[James Prinsep]] and [[Pandit Radhakanta Sarman]] would grace the society's meetings and publications over the following century, vastly enriching knowledge of India's culture and past.&lt;ref&gt;O.P. Kejariwal ''The Asiatic Society of Bengal and the Discovery of India's past'' (Delhi: OUP) 1988 pp29-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calcutta saw the establishment of several different Western-style higher education institutions this period, including [[The Sanskrit College and University|Sanskrit College]] (1824), [[Medical College and Hospital, Kolkata|Calcutta Medical College]] (1835),  [[University of Calcutta]] (1857), [[Surendranath College]] (1885) and the [[Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science]] (1887), India's first research institute.

=== The Baboo/Babu Culture and the Bengal Renaissance ===
{{See also|Bengal Renaissance}}
In the time of [[British India]], Calcutta was regarded as "the second city of the [[British Empire]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/asia/colonial-echoes-in-old-calcutta-8537339.html | title=Colonial echoes in old Calcutta | first=Steve | last=Turner | date=16 March 2013 | newspaper=The Independent | accessdate=24 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{according to whom|date=August 2013}} (after [[London]]) and was aptly renamed "City of Palaces" and the Great Eastern Hotel was regarded as the "Jewel of the East".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
Calcutta at that time was famous for its "[[Baboo Culture]]", a mixture of English [[Liberalism]],  European [[fin de siecle]] decadence, [[Mughal era|Mughal]]  conservatism,  and [[Hindu revivalism|indigenous revivalism]], inculcating aspects of socio-moral and political change.
This culture was fostered in its wake by the [[Zamindari system]], the [[Dayabhaga System]] the [[Hindu Joint Family System]], the [[Mitakshara System]], the Muslim [[Zenana System]], the Protestant spirit of free capitalist enterprise,  the Mughal-inspired feudal system and the [[Nautch]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
This also fostered the [[Bengal Renaissance]],{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} an awakening of modern liberal thinking in 19th century Bengal, and which gradually percolated to the rest of India.

=== Growth ===
In 1750, Calcutta had a population of 120,000.&lt;ref name=keay&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The centre of company control over the whole of Bengal from 1757, Calcutta underwent rapid industrial growth from the 1850s, especially in the textile sector, despite the poverty of the surrounding region. Trade with other nations also grew. For example, the first U.S. merchant ship arrived in Kolkata in 1787. In fact, the U.S Consulate in Calcutta is the U.S. Department of State's second-oldest consulate and dates from 19 November 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Despite being almost totally destroyed by a cyclone, in which 60,000 died, on 5 October 1864,  Calcutta grew, mostly in an unplanned way, in the next 150 years from 117,000 to 1,098,000 inhabitants (including suburbs), and now has a metropolitan population of approximately 14.6 million.

== Contribution to the independence movement of India ==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
Historically, Calcutta was the centre of activity in the early stages of the national movement of independence. Exactly a hundred years after the fall of Bengal in the [[Battle of Plassey]], Calcutta saw the beginning of what is often called the First Independence Movement of India. It should be noted here that it is also just as often as not referred to as a War of Independence, and as one historian put it, "The so called First National War of Independence was neither First, nor National, nor a War of Independence". In the suburbs of Calcutta, at the [[Barrackpore]] military barracks, [[sepoy]] [[Mangal Pandey]] sparked off a huge revolt that shook the foundations of the British Empire. This movement is sometimes also called the [[Indian Mutiny]], although recent evidence goes against using this name and suggests "The Revolt of 1857" as a better and less controversial choice.

In 1883, [[Surendranath Banerjea]] organised a [[Indian National Association|national conference]] - the first of its kind in 19th century India. This conference heralded the birth of The [[Indian National Congress]]. The first native president of the [[Indian National Congress]] was Sir [[Womesh Chunder Bonnerjee]] and he was also the first Congress president to advocate self-rule by Indians, Sir [[Surendra Nath Banerjea]] (referred to by the British as "Surrender Not") were early eminent Calcuttans, who provoked and influenced nationalist thinking in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Other societies based on nationalist or religious thoughts were started, like the [[Hindu Mela]]. Revolutionary organisations like the [[Jugantar]] and the [[Anushilan Samiti]] were formed with the goal of using force against the British rulers. Among early nationalist leaders, the most prominent were [[Sri Aurobindo]], Indira devi Chaudhurani, [[Bipin Chandra Pal]]. The early nationalists were inspired by [[Swami Vivekananda]], the foremost disciple of the [[Hindu]] mystic Sri [[Ramakrishna]] and helped by [[Sister Nivedita]], disciple of the former. The rousing cry that awakened India's soul was penned by [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]]. Now the national song of the nation, it is an ode to the land of [[Names of India#Bharat|Bharat]] (India) as the Divine Mother, "[[Vande Mataram]]."

The Elgin Road residence of [[Subhas Chandra Bose]] in Calcutta was the place from where he escaped the British to reach Germany during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He was the co-founder of the [[Indian National Army]] and the head of state of the [[Arzi Hukumate Azad Hind]], formed to counter and combat the [[British Raj]] in India. Renamed Netaji by poet laureate [[Rabindranath Tagore]], he is regarded by many as perhaps the most prominent and influential freedom fighter in Indian history and is venerated in many Bengali households even today.

Muslims were also involved in the nationalist movement, most notably Fazl Huq who from Calcutta in the 1930s attempted to organise a non-communal peasant party to agitate against the British and the wealthy Indian landowning class. The fact that many of the Hindus in this latter group were linked to the local Congress organisation and dominated the mainstream nationalist movement in Bengal from Calcutta led to attempts to thwart Huq's activities and fed into the tragic decline in communal relations that savaged Calcutta in 1946 and 1947 (see Kenneth McPherson, "The Muslim Microcosm: the Muslims of Calcutta 1918-1935", Steiner, Wiesbaden, 1973).

The intense violence caused during the [[partition of India]] led to a shift in demographics in Bengal, and especially Kolkata; large numbers of Muslims left for [[East Pakistan]], while hundreds of thousands of Hindus arrived to take their place.&lt;ref name="Patelbook"&gt;{{Harv|Gandhi|1992|pp=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolkata received millions of refugees from what became East Pakistan without receiving substantial assistance from the central government.&lt;ref name="Trillin95to97"&gt;Trillin, Calvin. "Last Days of the Rickshaw." ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. Volume 213, Number 4. April 2008. 95-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strife in labour relations (including strikes by workers and lockouts by employers) and a militant [[Maoism|Marxist-Maoist]] movement who sometimes used violence and property destruction as tactics of protest ‚Äî the [[Naxalite]]s ‚Äî damaged much of the city's infrastructure, leading to economic stagnation. (Ironically, this is the same city that has historically been a strong base of Indian communism: West Bengal was ruled by the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] (CPI(M)) dominated [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] for nearly three decades ‚Äî the world's longest-running democratically elected communist government.&lt;ref name=Biswas&gt;{{cite web

In 1971, the war between India and Pakistan led to another massive influx of refugees from the former East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), and their settling in Calcutta massively strained its already damaged infrastructure.&lt;ref name="londonanthology"&gt;{{Harv|Bennett|Hindle|1996|pp=63‚Äì70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trillin97"&gt;Trillin, Calvin. "Last Days of the Rickshaw." ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. Volume 213, Number 4. April 2008. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1970s, [[Mumbai|Bombay]] overtook Calcutta as India's most populous city.

Calcutta became plagued by power outages, labor unrest, disappearing industry, and violence from the [[Naxalite]] movement. In 1985 [[Rajiv Gandhi]] referred to Calcutta as a "dying city" because of the social and political traumas.&lt;ref name="Trillin97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,387701,00.html From Poorhouse to Powerhouse]." ''[[Spiegel Online]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's economic recovery gathered momentum after [[economic reforms in India]] introduced by the central government in the mid-1990s. Since 2000, [[Information Technology]] (IT) services revitalized the city's stagnant economy. The city has also experienced a growth in the manufacturing sector. Following similar moves elsewhere in the country, the state government changed the city's official name from ''Calcutta'' to ''Kolkata'' in 2001.&lt;ref name=Easwaran&gt;

{{Other uses}}{{Wiktionary|Howdy}}
'''Howdy''' is an informal [[greeting]], originally a shortened form of the greeting ''How do ye?'' It was first recorded as part of the South England dialect in 1563/87.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' vol. VII, p. 453‚Äì454.&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature from that period includes the use of ''How-do, how-do'' and ''How'' as a greeting used by the Scottish when addressing Anglo settlers in greeting. The double form of the idiom is still found in parts of the American Southwest as ''Howdy, howdy''.  Without regard to etymological beginnings, the word is used as a greeting such as "Hello" and not, normally, as an enquiry. As a result, it's not followed by a [[question mark]]. Punctuating ''Howdy'' commonly follows these rules:
(i) If ''Howdy'' is used as a complete sentence, it's followed by an [[exclamation mark]].
(ii) If ''Howdy'' is the first word in a sentence, it's followed by a [[comma]].

In the rural Southwestern United States, ''Howdy'' is a colloquial contraction of the formal greeting of ''How do you do?'', and as such is considered a formal and acceptable greeting for residents of that region of the world. ''Howdy'' is also the official greeting of [[Texas A&amp;M University]], though the two are not always automatically associated.

The word became recently popular in other areas of the world as it is the default greeting from the dashboard of [[WordPress]], a very popular content management system.&lt;ref&gt;http://trends.builtwith.com/cms&lt;/ref&gt; The probable reason for using "Howdy" (instead of "Welcome" or "Hello") in the dashboard is because [[Matt Mullenweg]], one of the main developers of WordPress, was born and raised in Texas.{{cn|date=April 2018}}

==Boy howdy==
The phrase "boy howdy" is a development of the greeting which adds the exclamation "boy" to form an [[interjection]] which indicates an emphatic affirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.word-detective.com/2008/07/boy-howdy/comment-page-1/ |title=Boy Howdy |work=The Word Detective |date=14 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jumanji''''' is an American [[multimedia franchise]] based around the 1981 [[fantasy]] [[Children's literature|children's]] [[picture book]] [[Jumanji (picture book)|of the same name]], written and illustrated by the American author [[Chris Van Allsburg]].

The franchise follows the adventures of various people who find themselves imperiled when playing a magic [[board game]] called ''Jumanji'' that will either trap players within its dangerous jungle world or unleash its menaces into the real world. Ultimately, the only way to end the disruptions is to finish the game while enduring its resulting dangers with each succeeding move, after which everything is restored to normal outside of the players' memories.

==Books==

===''Jumanji'' (1981)===
{{main|Jumanji (picture book)}}
Two children, Peter and Judy, find and play a game in which each roll of the dice brings the jungle from the game (as well as the creatures that live in it) to life around them. In order to reset the world around them, they must finish the game. Afterward, they get rid of the game which is found by their next-door neighbors, two young brothers.

===''Zathura'' (2002)===
{{main|Zathura}}
Brothers Danny and Walter, neighbors of Peter and Judy from the previous book, find Jumanji but ultimately choose not to play it. Instead, they find a similar game with a space theme, "Zathura", which they begin to play. As with Jumanji, playing Zathura brings elements of the game into reality, and in order to set everything back to normal, the boys must complete the game.

==Films==

===''Jumanji'' (1995)===
{{main|Jumanji}}
Two children find and play a magical board game. In doing so, they release a man trapped for decades in it and a host of dangers that can only be stopped by finishing the game.

===''Zathura: A Space Adventure'' (2005)===
{{main|Zathura: A Space Adventure}}
Two young brothers are drawn into an intergalactic adventure when their house is hurled through the depths of space by the magical board game they are playing. Furthermore, the brothers surmise the only way to return home is to finish the game.

Though there are no direct references in ''Zathura'' to the other films, and the movie's plot is completely self-contained, the studio marketed it as being set in the world of ''Jumanji'', and was thematically similar. The film is based on the children's book ''[[Zathura]]'', also written by Van Allsburg which was a sequel to the ''Jumanji'' source material.

===''Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'' (2017)===
{{main|Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle}}
Twenty-one years after the events of the [[Jumanji|original film]], the board game evolves into a video game. Four teenagers who are transported to the game's jungle setting and become the avatars of the characters they chose, and later discover another victim trapped in the game as well. The only way out is to complete the game, and in doing so, they each discover the best of themselves and  win with a newfound heroism to see the challenge through. This film serves as a [[sequel]] to the 1995 film.

===Untitled ''Jumanji'' film (2019)===
Following the release of ''Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle'', the film's cast discussed in interviews what a potential third ''Jumanji'' could be about. [[Karen Gillan]] also stated that an alternate ending left the door open for another movie, but that the scene was removed from the final cut of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/nick-jonas-interview-jumanji-3/|title=Nick Jonas Has A Funny Idea For The Next Jumanji Sequel|author=Rob Keyes|work=Screen Rant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/jumanji-3-jack-black-idea-sequel/|title=Jack Black Has A Great Idea For Jumanji 3|author=Matt Dolloff|work=Screen Rant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/jumanji-3-casting/|title=Here‚Äôs Who Jumanji‚Äôs Stars Want to See in Jumanji 3|author=Christopher Isaac|work=Screen Rant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-jumanji-welcome-to-the-jungle-cast-have-jumanji-3-ideas-plus-an-alternate-ending-for-the-new-sequel/|title=The ‚ÄòJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle‚Äô Cast Have ‚ÄòJumanji 3‚Äô Ideas, Plus an Alternate Ending for the New Sequel|author=Chris Evangelista|work=Slash Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, it was announced that a third ''Jumanji'' film is in production with Kasdan returning to direct and Rosenberg and Pinkner returning to write the film, respectively.

[[File:Jurgen a comedy of justice.jpg|thumb|right|Dust-jacket illustration by [[Frank C. Pap√©]] for a 1932 edition.]]
'''''Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice''''' is a [[fantasy]] novel by American writer [[James Branch Cabell]], which gained fame (or notoriety) shortly after its publication in 1919. It is a humorous romp through a medieval cosmos, including a send-up of [[Arthurian legend]], and excursions to Heaven and Hell as in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]''.  Cabell's work is recognized as a landmark in the creation of the [[comic fantasy]] novel, influencing [[Terry Pratchett]] and many others.

==The book and its reception==
The eponymous hero, who considers himself a "monstrous clever fellow," embarks on a journey through ever more fantastic realms in search of a parodized version of [[courtly love]]. Everywhere he goes he meets eccentric knights and damsels, in an acerbic satire of contemporary America. Jurgen gains the attention of the Lady of the Lake, Queen [[Guinevere]], and even [[the Devil]]'s wife.

The novel became more widely known after the [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]] attempted to bring a prosecution for obscenity. The [[printing plate]]s were seized on January 4, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ash|first=Russell|authorlink=Russell Ash|title=It Just Slipped Out...|year=2010|publisher=headline|isbn=978-0-7553-6086-4|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case went on for two years before Cabell and his publisher, [[Robert M. McBride]], won. They argued that the "indecencies" were [[double entendre]]s that also had perfectly decent interpretations, though it appeared that what had actually offended the prosecution most was the work's mocking expression of philosophy, including a jest about the nature of [[papal infallibility]].

In 1922, Guy Holt his editor and publisher who was also named in the court case published ''Jurgen and the Law, A Statement. With Exhibits, including the Court's Opinion, and the brief for the Defendants on Motion to Direct an Acquittal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/JurgenAndTheLaw|title=Jurgen and the Law, A Statement. With Exhibits, including the Court's Opinion, and the brief for the Defendants on Motion to Direct an Acquittal.|last=|first=|date=|website=Internet Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were only one thousand copies printed for sale. 

Cabell took an author's revenge. The revised edition of 1923{{cn|date=August 2017}} included a previously "lost" passage in which the hero is placed on trial by the [[Philistines]], with a large dung-beetle as the chief prosecutor. He also wrote a short book, ''Taboo'', in which he thanked [[John S. Sumner]] and the Society for the Suppression of Vice for generating the publicity that gave his career a boost.

Writing in the ''Pacific Review'' in 1921, [[Vernon Louis Parrington]] praised ''Jurgen'', and described Cabell as "one of the greatest masters of English prose."&lt;ref&gt;Fred C. Hobson, ''The Silencing of Emily Mullen and Other Essays'', LSU Press, 2005 {{ISBN|0807130974}} (p. 140).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleister Crowley]] called ''Jurgen'' one of the "epoch-making masterpieces of philosophy" in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.com/crowley/confess/chapter7.html The Confessions of Aleister Crowley&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; - the book contains a parody of Crowley's [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billheidrick.com/tlc1998/tlc0698.htm Thelema Lodge Calendar for June 1998 e.v&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's famous phrase from ''[[The Book of the Law]]'', "There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt"&lt;ref&gt;''Liber AL'', III:60&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîor its source, [[Fran√ßois Rabelais|Rabelais]]'s "there was but this one clause to be observed, ''Do What Thou Wilt''"&lt;ref&gt;Rabelais, Fran√ßois. ''Gargantua and Pantagruel''. Everyman's Library. {{ISBN|978-0-679-43137-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;‚Äîis parodied as "There is no law in Cocaigne save, Do that which seems good to you."&lt;ref&gt;''Jurgen'', ch. XXII&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing Cabell's later novel, ''Hamlet Had An Uncle'', [[Basil Davenport]] called ''Jurgen'' "a masterpiece."&lt;ref&gt;"In the Lineage of ''Jurgen''" by Basil Davenport (Review of ''Hamlet Had an Uncle'', by James Branch Cabell) ''[[Saturday Review (U.S. magazine)|The Saturday Review]]'', January 27, 1940, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert A. Heinlein]] consciously patterned his best-known novel, ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]'', after ''Jurgen'', and Cabell's influence is also evident in the titles and themes of at least two other novels by Heinlein: his long-unpublished first novel, ''[[For Us, The Living: A Comedy of Customs]]'' (written 1938, published 2003), and his late work ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]'' (1984).

Filmmaker [[J√ºrgen Vsych]] was named after ''Jurgen, A Comedy of Justice'', which was her father's favorite book.&lt;ref&gt;"The Woman Director" by [[Jurgen Vsych]], 2004 {{ISBN|0-9749879-0-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the [[Classical Arabic]] ''kubbah'' (''kibbeh'' in North [[Levantine Arabic]]), which means "ball".&lt;ref&gt;Maan Z. Madina, ''Arabic-English Dictionary of the Modern Literary Language'', 1973&lt;/ref&gt;  Various [[transliteration]]s of the name are used in different countries: in English, ''kibbe'' and ''kibbeh'' and in Latin America, ''quibe'', quibbe, ''kibe'', or ''quipe'' ([[Argentina]]).

In [[Levantine cuisine]], a variety of dishes made with bulghur (cracked wheat) and minced lamb are called ''kibbeh''. The northern Syrian city of [[Aleppo]] (Halab) is famous for having more than 17 different types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NPR web: Food Lovers Discover The Joys Of Aleppo| url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=122058669}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include ''kibbeh'' prepared with [[sumac]] (''kibbe sumƒÅqiyye''), [[yogurt]] (''kibbe labaniyye''), [[quince]] (''kibbe safarjaliyye''), lemon juice (''kibbe ·∏•ƒÅm·∏ça''), [[pomegranate]] sauce, [[cherry]] sauce, and other varieties, such as the "disk" ''kibbeh'' (''kibbe arƒÅ·π£''), the "plate" ''kibbeh'' (''kibbe bi·π£fƒ´·∏•a'' or ''kibbe b·π£ƒìniyye'') and the raw ''kibbeh'' (''[[kibbeh nayyeh]]'').

''[[Kibbeh nayyeh]]'' is a raw dish made from a mixture of bulghur, very finely minced lamb or beef similar to [[steak tartare]], and Middle Eastern spices, served on a platter, frequently as part of a ''[[meze]]'' in [[Lebanon]] and [[Syria]], garnished with mint leaves and olive oil, and served with green onions or scallions, green hot peppers, and [[pita]]/pocket bread or ''[[markouk]]'' bread.

''Kubba Halab'' is an Iraqi version of kibbeh created with a rice crust and named after the largest city in Syria, [[Aleppo]]. ''Kubba Mosul'', also Iraqi, is flat and round like a disc. ''Kubbat Shorba'' is an Iraqi-Kurdish version prepared as a stew, commonly made with tomato sauce and spices.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18547399|title=Kibbe at the Crossroads: A Lebanese Kitchen Story|website=npr.org|accessdate=13 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often served with [[arak (liqueur)|''arak'']] and various salads. The Iraqi versions are part of the same versions eaten in Iran.&lt;ref name=Davidson-p444-445/&gt;

A Syrian soup known as ''kubbi kishk'' consists of ''kubbi'' "torpedoes" or "footballs" in a yogurt (''kishk'') and butter broth with stewed cabbage leaves. Another soup, known as ''kibbeh hamda'', consists of a chicken stock with vegetables (usually leeks, celery, turnips and courgettes), lemon juice and garlic, with small ''kibbeh'' made with ground rice as dumplings.&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Roden, ''A Book of Middle Eastern Food''&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=February 2018}} In the [[Syrian Jews|Syrian Jewish]] diaspora this is popular both at [[Pesach]] and as the pre-fast meal on the day before [[Yom Kippur]].&lt;ref&gt;Poopa Dweck, ''Aromas of Aleppo''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2018}}

On Colombia's Carribean coast, the dish uses only ground beef and is frequently served in social occasions, often as a starter along with other regional delicacies, including [[Empanada|Empanadas]], [[Teque√±o|Teque√±os]] and [[Carima√±ola|Carima√±olas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/967261642|title=Musical imagiNation : U.S.-Colombian identity and the Latin music boom|last=author.|first=Cepeda, Mar√≠a Elena,|isbn=9780814772904|oclc=967261642}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lint''' is the common name for visible accumulations of [[textile]] [[fiber]]s and other materials, usually found on and around [[clothing]]. Certain materials used in the manufacture of clothing, such as [[cotton]], [[linen]], and [[wool]], contain numerous, very short fibers bundled together.&lt;ref name="ESD"&gt;{{cite book|authors=R. W. Welker, Ramamurthy Nagarajan, Carl E. Newberg|title=Contamination and ESD Control in High-Technology Manufacturing|year=2006|pages= 415‚Äì16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of normal wear, these fibers may either detach or be jostled out of the weave of which they are part. This is the reason that heavily used articles like [[shirt]]s and [[towel]]s become thin over time, and why these particles collect in the lint screen of a [[clothes dryer]].&lt;ref name="ESD"/&gt;

Because of their low surface area, [[static cling]] causes fibers that have detached from an article of clothing to continue to stick to one another and to that article or other surfaces with which they come in contact. Other small fibers or particles also accumulate with these clothing fibers, including human and animal [[hair]] and [[skin cell]]s, plant fibers, and [[pollen]], [[dust]], and [[microorganism]]s.

The [[etymology]] of the modern word "lint" is related to "linting", the term used for the cultivation of the shorter fibers from the [[Gossypium|cotton plant]] (''[[Gossypium]]''), also called "lint", from which lower-quality cotton products are manufactured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Norma R. Hollen &amp; Jane Saddler|title=Modern Textiles|year=1952|page= 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lint is composed of threads of all colors, which blend hues and may appear to be a uniform grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glass|first=Don|title=The Color of Lint|url=http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/color-lint/|work=A Moment of Science|publisher=Indiana Public Media|accessdate=26 March 2013|date=October 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Varieties of lint==

===Dryer lint===
'''Dryer lint''' is lint generated by the drying of clothes in a [[clothes dryer]]; it typically accumulates on a dryer screen. [[Underwriters Laboratories]] recommends cleaning the lint filter after every cycle for safety and energy efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/offerings/perspectives/consumer/productsafety/dryers/ Underwriters Laboratories product safety tips ‚Äì clothes dryers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305213824/http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/offerings/perspectives/consumer/productsafety/dryers/ |date=2014-03-05 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Navel lint===
'''Navel lint''' (also known by names such as '''navel fluff''', '''belly button lint,''' '''belly button fluff,''' and '''dip lint''') is an accumulation of fluffy fibers in the [[navel]] cavity. Many people find that, at the beginning and end of the day, a small lump of fluff has appeared in the navel cavity. This lint is an accumulation of cloth fibers that are scraped by body hair. The reasons for its accumulation in the navel are a subject of speculation. A likely hypothesis is that rubbing of navel hairs and [[clothing]] contributes to a build-up of [[static electricity]], resulting in the collection of clothing fibers and to a lesser extent, dead skin cells.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Georg Steinhauser, a chemist writing in the journal ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'', said that small pieces of fluff first form in the hair and then end up in the navel at the end of the day. He further said that abdominal hair often seems to grow in [[concentric circle]]s around the navel; the scaly structure of the hair enhances the abrasion of minuscule fibres from the shirt and directs the lint towards the belly button.&lt;ref name="georg"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/4883791/Revealed-The-secrets-of-belly-button-fluff.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Patrick | last=Sawer | title=Revealed: The secrets of belly button fluff | date=28 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinhauser established that shaving one's belly will result in a fluff-free navel but only until the hairs grow back. His other suggestions include wearing old clothes, which tend to shed less lint than newer garments, which can lose up to one-thousandth of their weight to the belly button over the course of a year. A body piercing can also be used, with [[Navel piercing|belly button rings]] particularly effective at sweeping away fibres before they lodge.&lt;ref name="georg" /&gt;

===Pocket lint===
'''Pocket lint''' (also known as '''gnurr'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/30/authorisms-words-wrought-writers-review-fascinating-history-neologisms ''"..."gnurr", Alastair Reid's name for the fluff that collects in pockets or trouser cuffs."'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dickson, ''Authorisms: Words Wrought by Writers'' (2014), noting that the word was coined by poet [[Alastair Reid]].&lt;/ref&gt;) is [[debris]] including bits of [[fabric]] as well as small shreds of [[paper]] and [[Facial tissue|tissue]] that are often found in [[pocket]]s. It may be caused by running the clothing through a [[washing machine]] one or more times, causing the pocket lining or contents to compact and shred.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

As pocket lint is an [[wikt:amalgamation|amalgamation]] of the contents of the pockets, pocket lint can be helpful when determining whether [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s have been previously stored in the pockets, by testing it with various [[drug test]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} In a survival situation, pocket lint can be used as tinder for starting a fire.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The [[Infocom]] game, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', was sold with a collection of "props" that included a small bag of "pocket fluff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Blake Wilson | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/hitchikers-guide-the-game/ |title='Hitchhiker's Guide': The Game "Arts Beat"|work=[[The New York Times]]| date=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems related to lint==

===Biological problems===
Inhalation of excessive amounts of lint, as observed in early textile workers, may lead to diseases of the lungs, such as [[byssinosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Yafa| title=Cotton: The Biography of a Revolutionary Fiber|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lint shed from clothing during the course of wear may also carry [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mastura Raheel|title=Protective Clothing Systems and Materials |year=1994|page= 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, the presence of lint presents a danger during [[surgery]], when it might carry microorganisms into open wounds. It has been demonstrated that due to the abrasive contact between clothing and skin, "a person wearing a standard cotton scrub suit actually sheds more bacteria than without clothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=G.S. Kulkarni|title= Textbook of Orthopedics and Trauma|year=2008| page= 296}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lint presents a threat to the environment in spaces that generally do not experience human contact, constituting "one of the primary polluters" in [[cave exploration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Hurd|title=Entering the Stone: On Caves and Feeling Through the Dark|year= 2005|page= 54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical problems===
Lint contamination also presents what may be the most serious threat of damage to delicate mechanical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira Cochin|title=  Analysis and Design of the Gyroscope for Inertial Guidance|year=1963|page= 143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Michael Kozicki, Stuart A. Hoenig &amp; Patrick J. Robinson| title=Cleanrooms: Facilities and Practices|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to prevent lint contamination, workers entering [[clean room]]s are generally required to wear an outer layer of clothing made from artificial fibers that are longer and thicker, and therefore much less likely to shed any material.&lt;ref name="ESD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inside Story on Outdoor Gear|work=[[Popular Science]]|date=May 1991|volume= 238|number= 5|page= 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lint-resistant clothing materials include elastic fabrics like [[spandex]] (or Lycra), for which the fibers will tend to stretch rather than break, and longer, stronger non-woven [[polyolefin]] fibers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishan Kumar Chawla|title=Fibrous Materials|year=1998|page= 102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other problems===
Lint on clothing is generally considered unattractive and unprofessional. Furthermore, lint may be abrasive and may damage the clothing itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cynthia Townley Ewer|title=Houseworks|year=2009|page= 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, visible lint is often removed with a [[lint remover]] or [[clothes brush]]. The accumulation of lint during clothes cleaning can be reduced with the use of a [[fabric softener]], which reduces the amount of static electricity on clothing surfaces and therefore prevents the lint from sticking to the clothes.&lt;ref&gt;J{{cite book|author=Jeff Bredenberg|title=Clean It Fast, Clean It Right|year=1999|pages= 235‚Äì236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dryer lint, which collects on the lint screen of a [[clothes dryer]], is highly flammable and therefore presents a [[fire hazard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Kleinert|title=Troubleshooting and Repairing Major Appliances|year=1995|page= 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of this flammability, dryer lint may be collected for use as tinder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lori Baird|title=Don't Throw It Out: Recycle, Renew and Reuse to Make Things Last|year=2007|page= 216}}&lt;/ref&gt; although burning man-made fibres can produce toxic fumes.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

==Uses of lint==

===Composting===
It is possible to [[compost]] lint retrieved from the lint screen on a dryer by adding it to other materials being composted. The texture of the material allows the organic matter within it to compost quickly and easily, but depending on the source, it may include inorganic fibers and materials which never break down.&lt;ref name="CCGG"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Barbara Pleasant &amp; Deborah L. Martin|title=The Complete Compost Gardening Guide|year=2008|page= 128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic science===
Lint is useful to examine in [[forensic science]] because it is accumulated over time, and because the fibers shed from clothing adhere to not only that clothing, but also other particles to which the carrier is exposed. The lint on a person's clothing is therefore likely to contain material transferred from the various environments through which that person has passed,&lt;ref name="FEC145"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Moira Taupin |author2=Chesterene Cwiklik |title=Forensic Examination of Clothing|year= 2009|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; enabling forensic examiners to collect and examine lint to determine the movements and activities of the wearer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Moira Taupin |author2=Chesterene Cwiklik |title=Forensic Examination of Clothing|year=2009|page= 195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Ashraf Mozayani &amp; Carla Noziglia|title= The Forensic Laboratory Handbook: Procedures and Practice|year= 2006|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examiners may use various chemicals to isolate lint fibers from different articles of clothing based on differences in color and other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jane Moira Taupin |author2=Chesterene Cwiklik | title=Forensic Examination of Clothing|year=2009|page= 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tinder===
As noted above, dryer lint burns readily. Although this may present a hazard in the household, it also means that lint makes excellent [[tinder]] for starting fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Michael Sweeney, Mireya Mayor &amp; Michele Kayal|title=National Geographic Complete Survival Manual|year=  2009|page= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially useful for catching sparks from [[flint and steel]], or similar striker-type fire starters in the absence of matches.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Wound treatment===
Lint was used as a form of wound treatment for cuts and sores as early as 1500 BC and as recently as the [[American Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Buffalo Medical Journal|volume= 2|year=1846|page=397|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIydo2N9PjsC&amp;pg=PA397&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;dq=charpie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1Mn8LPwR-R&amp;sig=VMjFy8UfDQNx9J114GU1Gbswb7w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QMbDUd6bDMWx4AOytIHwDA&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=charpie&amp;f=false|title=Notes of a European Tour}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lint used specifically for treating wounds was sometimes referred to as ''[[wikt:charpie|charpie]]''.

==Service==
[[File:Crucifixion icon orthodox cathedral vilnius.JPG|thumb|''[[Golgotha]]'' (Crucifixion icon), Orthodox cathedral in [[Vilnius]]. The lity tray (memorial stand) is at lower right, where the memorial services are celebrated. The stand has holders for the faithful to place candles.]]
In the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]], the various [[Prayer for the dead|prayers for the departed]] have as their purpose praying for the repose of the departed, comforting the living, and reminding the living of their own mortality and the brevity of this earthly life. For this reason, memorial services have an air of [[penitence]] about them.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the Panikhida does not have the chanting of "God is the Lord..." as the [[Moleben]] does; but instead uses, as at matins on Saturdays when the dead are remembered, the "[[Alleluia]]" of the Dead in place of "God is the Lord".&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be served more frequently during the four fasting seasons.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Great Lent]], [[Nativity Fast]], [[Apostles' Fast]] and [[Dormition Fast]]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the service is for an individual, it is often held at the deceased's graveside. If it is a general commemoration of all the departed, or if the individual's grave is not close by, the service is held in a church, in front of a special small, free-standing "memorial table", to which is attached an upright [[crucifix]] and with a [[candelabra]] for the faithful to put lighted candles.

The deacon (or, if there is no deacon, the priest) swings the [[thurible|censer]] throughout almost the entire service, while all stand holding lighted candles. Near the end of the service, during the final [[troparia]], all, either extinguish their candles, or place them in a candle holder by the memorial table. Each candle symbolizes the individual soul, which, as it were, each person holds in his own hand. The extinguishing (or giving up) of the candle, at the end of the service, symbolizes the fact that each person will have to surrender his soul, at the end of his life. 

The service is composed of [[Psalm]]s, [[ektenia]]s (litanies), hymns and prayers. In its outline it follows the general order of [[Matins]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;From this comes the Greek name ''parastas'' which refers to standing all night in vigil, which in the early days was what literally took place.&lt;/ref&gt; and is, in effect, a truncated [[funeral]] service. Some of the most notable portions of the service are the [[Kontakion]] of the Departed&lt;ref group=note&gt;Kontakion of the Departed: "With the saints give rest, O Christ, to the soul(s) of Thy servant(s), where there is neither sickness, nor sorrow, nor sighing, but life everlasting.&lt;/ref&gt; and the final singing of "[[Memory Eternal]]" (Slavonic: ''Vyechnaya Pamyat'').

The memorial service is most frequently served at the end of the [[Divine Liturgy]]; however, it may also be served after [[Vespers]], [[Matins]], or as a separate service by itself. If the service is held separately, there are readings from the Pauline epistles and the Gospels, which are assigned by the day of the week; no readings, however, are assigned to Sunday because Sunday should emphasize the resurrection of Christ rather than the departed.

For the memorial service, [[koliva]] (a ritual food of boiled [[wheat]]) is often prepared and is placed in front of the memorial table or an icon of Christ. Afterwards, it is blessed by the priest, who sprinkles it with [[Holy water#Eastern Orthodox holy water|holy water]]. &lt;ref group=note&gt;in the [[Bulgarian Orthodox Church|Bulgarian Church]] it is also customary for the priest to pour wine on the koliva and on the grave&lt;/ref&gt; The koliva is then taken to the [[refectory]] and is served to all those who attended the service.

==Occasions==
After an [[Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] Christian dies there are special "Prayers for the Departure of the Soul" that are said by the priest. Then the family or friends of the departed will wash and dress the body and it is placed in the [[casket]] after which a special expanded memorial service called the '''First Panikhida''' is celebrated, following which the reading of the [[Psalter]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;or the Gospels if the departed be a priest&lt;/ref&gt; commences and continues uninterrupted until the funeral. 

Traditionally, in addition to the service on the day of death, the memorial service is performed at the request of the relatives of an individual departed person on the following occasions:
*'''Third day''' after death&lt;ref group=note&gt;In calculating the number of days, the actual day of death is counted as the first day. According to St. [[Macarius the Great]], the reason for these days is as follows: from the third day to the ninth day after death, the departed is soul is shown the mansions of [[Paradise]] (the funeral is normally performed on the third day); from the ninth to the fortieth days, the soul is shown the torments of [[hell]]; and on the fortieth day, the soul stands before the throne of God to undergo the [[Particular judgement|Particular Judgement]] and is assigned the place where it will await the [[Second Coming]]. For this reason, the fortieth day is considered to be the most important. In some traditions, the semi-anniversary (six months) is also commemorated.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ninth day'''
*'''Fortieth day'''
*'''Three months'''
*'''Six months'''
*'''First anniversary''' of death
*'''Third anniversary''' (some will request a memorial every year on the anniversary of death) 

It is also served on the numerous [[Saturday of Souls|Soul Saturdays]] throughout the year.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Saturday is generally a day dedicated to prayer for the departed, because Christ lay dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on a Saturday. In some [[monastery|monasteries]] and large churches, it is customary to serve a Panikhida on every Saturday, unless a [[Great Feast|major feast]] occurs on that day.&lt;/ref&gt; On these days, not only is the memorial service served, but there are also special [[proper (liturgy)|propers]] at [[Vespers]], [[Matins]], and the [[Divine Liturgy]]. These days of general memorials are:
*'''Meatfare Saturday''' (two Saturdays before Great Lent begins)‚Äîin some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the preceding week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday 
*'''The second Saturday of Great Lent''' 
*'''The third Saturday of Great Lent''' 
*'''The fourth Saturday of Great Lent''' 
*In the Russian tradition, '''[[Radonitsa]]'''&amp;mdash;Tuesday following [[Thomas Sunday]]; i.e., the second Tuesday after [[Easter|Pascha]] (Easter)&lt;ref group=note&gt;Because of the sacredness of the days, The celebration of memorial services is forbidden during [[Holy Week]] and [[Bright Week]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]'''‚Äîin some traditions families and friends will offer Panikhidas for their loved ones during the preceding week, culminating in the general commemoration on Saturday 
*In the Russian tradition, '''Demetrius Saturday''' (the Saturday closest to the feast of [[Saint Demetrius]], October 26), commemorating the soldiers who fell in the [[Battle of Kulikovo]] (1380), under the leadership of St. [[Demetrius of the Don]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=83] "Orthodox Church in America &amp;mdash; Lives of the Saints", Retrieved 2013-06-29&lt;/ref&gt;

the celebration of memorial services is forbidden from [[Maundy Thursday|Holy Thursday]] through [[Bright Week]] and on all Sundays throughout the year.

==Lity== &lt;!-- [[Lity]] and [[Litiy]] redirect here --&gt;
A very abbreviated form of the memorial service is called the ''Lity'' (or ''Liti'' or ''Litia''), from the Greek ŒªŒπœÑ·Ω¥ œÑŒµŒªŒµœÑŒÆ, ''litƒì teletƒì'', i.e. a plain ceremony, or ŒªŒπœÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºœåœÉœÖŒΩŒøŒΩ, ''liton mnƒìmosynon'', i.e. a plain mnemosynon; it consists only of the concluding portion of the regular memorial service. This is often celebrated in the [[narthex]] of the church on ordinary weekdays (i.e., when there is no higher-ranking [[feast day]]), especially during [[Great Lent]].

'''Mock language''' is a term in [[linguistic anthropology]] for the intentional use of a language not spoken by or native to the speaker that is used to reinforce the speaker's [[language ideology]] of the hegemonic language.

When talking, the speaker includes words or phrases from other languages that they think fit into the conversation. The term "[[Mock Spanish]]" was popularized in the 1990s by [[Jane H. Hill]], a linguist at the [[University of Arizona]], mock Spanish is the most common form of mock language in the southwestern [[United States]], where Hill first researched the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://language-culture.binghamton.edu/symposia/2/part1/|title=Mock Spanish: A Site For The Indexical Reproduction Of Racism In American English|last=Hill|first=Jane H.|date=|website=language-culture.binghamton.edu|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "Mock" has since been applied to other languages, and the [[umbrella term]] "Mock language" developed. Mock language is commonly viewed as a form of appropriation. In the United States, the most common form is mock Spanish. However, globally, mock language is used to share meaning between the speaker and audience about the speech community the speaker is mocking.

== Definition ==
The speaker is unintentionally indexing a [[language ideology]] that all Americans should speak English or that other languages are secondary in the US. Using words outside the speaker's native language neglects context of the conversion, meaning of the word or phrase, or conceptual knowledge including historical injustices to the borrowed language, culture, and physical surroundings. It is a borrowing words in different languages and using it in your context.

When using mock language, the speaker is showing their '[[cosmopolitanism]]' or global knowledge. One dominant language ideology is that English should be the only language spoken in the United States, establishing English as a hegemonic language. This [[hegemony]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=3uxHCFOrEjwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=Lull,+J.+(2000).+Media,+communication,+culture:+A+global+approach+(2nd+ed.).+New+York:+Columbia+University+Press&amp;ots=JARfcJrcB6&amp;sig=ejH_hZjCuDYZ_TAtfVqbdYYQpwc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Media, Communication, Culture: A Global Approach|last=Lull|first=James|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231120739|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; creates a dominance of the hegemonic group over the ones that have not conformed. Mock language reinforces this, as it takes language and culture out of context to show the speaker's worldly knowledge, but does not celebrate or intellectually use the language. This ideology is actually maintaining the subordinate status of the other languages used as the language speakers in that community are expected to speak English and not in a mocking way.

For the opposing perspective, saying that using other languages in an English conversation is supportive of that language, it does not show awareness of the cultural or social meanings behind the words spoken.  
 
== History, Theorists, and Contributors ==
The term "Mock Spanish" was popularized in the 1990s by linguistic anthropologist Jane H. Hill. This led to other languages being referred to as "Mock-Languages." Increasing globalization in modern history has contributed significantly to the spreading and study of Mock-Language in linguistic anthropology. Globalization has occurred at an exponential rate through numerous media‚Äîsuch as television and social networking applications‚Äîduring the turn of the 21st century. With globalization, more languages are being encountered in daily interactions, and more people are able to travel. To show this global perspective, it is common to incorporate words of different languages into your native language, thus mock language.

Hill analyzes the 'inner sphere' and 'outer spheres' in which Puerto Ricans living in [[New York City|New York]] uses their [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]]. In the inner sphere of neighborhood and intimates such as family and close friends, the boundaries between English and Spanish are blurred formally and functionally. However, in the outer sphere with strangers or government officials, the usage of Spanish becomes [[Markedness|marked]] and "sharply objectified" to the point where the boundaries are so distinct that bilingual speakers may become too scared to speak at all.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hill|first=Jane|date=|title=Language, Race, and White Public Space|url=https://www-jstor-org.colorado.idm.oclc.org/stable/682046?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=100 (No. 3)|pages=680‚Äì689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows the hegemonic power of English and how Spanish speakers feel vulnerable and powerless to use Spanish. The need for perfect English is absolute, yet when English speakers dabble in Spanish in this mocking way, there is no nervousness, as their agency extends beyond English hegemony and into the power an English speaker holds in American society. Hill also discusses how [[semantic domain]]s index a state.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Saying something is "el cheapo" indexes that Spanish speakers do not have money or commonly buy cheap, crappy goods.

In a more recent study of Mock White Girl, researcher Tyanna Slobe explains how it is a hegemonic representation of a language being dominated than another and how people would to try to identify with that race by saying a combination of words in that language. ‚Äú...complicating the moralizing gaze with which linguists have approached mock as uniformly reproducing white supremacist ideologies.‚Äù&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Slobe|first=Tyanna|date=2018|title=Style, Stance, and Social Meaning in Mock White Girl|url=|journal=Language in Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the performance piece that people want others to portray themselves to why they would speak this way.

Mock white girl shows how the intentional use of [[Vocal fry register|vocal fry]] to convey a mockery of the white, upper-class, suburban, spoiled young adult or teenager is conveying a shared meaning that the language the speaker is mocking is subordinate and not to be taken seriously. It indexes the characteristics of a stereotypical white girl and uses the n+1 level of indexicality for the public to make the connection between the mockery and the speech community.

Another semantic domain is language crossing. ‚ÄúLanguage crossing involves code alternation by people who are not accepted members of the group associated with the second language that they are using (code switching into varieties that are not generally thought to belong to them). This kind of switching involves a distinct sense of movement across social or ethnic boundaries and it raises issues of legitimacy which, in one way or another, participants need to negotiate in the course of their encounter.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rampton|first=Ben|date=1995-12-01|title=Language crossing and the problematisation of ethnicity and socialisation|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|journal=Pragmatics. Quarterly Publication of the International Pragmatics Association (IPrA)|language=en|volume=5|issue=4|pages=485‚Äì513|doi=10.1075/prag.5.4.04ram|issn=1018-2101|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to mock language as the people code alternating are not members of the group, similar to how mock-language speakers are English speakers not members of the language they are mocking.

== Implications of Study ==
Mock language is used in [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] to interpret different languages in a conversation and the characteristics of borrowing words from a language. It is important to study mock language in order to preserve the original foundations of languages or dialects that have become subject to the pressure of globalization. Each time a mock phrase is used, it reinforces the divergence from the original language. Globalization occurs at a much faster rate today than in the past, largely due to technological advancements that connect the world with no regard for national borders. American culture is overwhelmingly dominant in the field of online media, and American interpretations of other cultures often become somewhat of a universal standard, at least in terms of exposure. This makes it important for linguists to analyze such interpretations and recognize their origins.

The study of Mock Language also reveals several powerful racial ideologies in the way English speakers hold agency to use other languages carelessly. ‚ÄúIt is certainly useful to think of linguistic signs as being bound to historical contexts. But a limited historical view of language fails to address the fact that speakers are often not aware of the historical references they make by using particular signs.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chun|first=Elaine W.|date=June 2001|title=The Construction of White, Black, and Korean American Identities through African American Vernacular English|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=11|issue=1|pages=52‚Äì64|doi=10.1525/jlin.2001.11.1.52|issn=1055-1360|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to a general ignorance, mostly from the perspective of English speakers, regarding the use of certain phrases. Misuses of certain words can eventually be attributed to legitimate cultures after overuse, especially with the help of modern media as a medium of exposure, undermining history and often introducing the possibility of offending native speakers.

== Controversy ==
In the United States, the dominant language ideology is that English should be the official language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/april_2018/americans_strongly_favor_english_as_official_language|title=Americans Strongly Favor English as Official Language|last=|first=|date=2018-04-26|website=Rasmussen Reports|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Racial minorities are treated adversely than whites, and their languages are not perceived as ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} There are many social, economic, environmental disadvantages of minority groups. The dominant ideology does not allow these groups to celebrate their language, yet ‚Äúmock language involves borrowings and wordplay by speakers who require little comprehension of the other language.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vessey|first=Rachelle|date=2014|title=Borrowed words, mock language and nationalism in Canada|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|volume=14|issue=2|pages=176‚Äì190|doi=10.1080/14708477.2013.863905|issn=1470-8477|eissn=1747-759X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mock language reinforces the status and social differences of native English speakers versus minorities and ethnic communities.

== Features of Mock Language ==
[[File:Namaste in bed.jpg|thumb|People usually wear this shirt to indicate that they are going to yoga or going to sleep to promote laziness and zen with the language Hindi.It creates a pun through code switching, but the Hindi word is not actually associated with yoga.]]
While not every use of mock language is the same, aspects such as gendered indicators, greetings, and pronouns are commonly used. It may come about without the intention of knowing the harm for that language's speech community. Mock Spanish commonly uses gendered [[pronoun]]s of 'el', 'la', and adds '-o' to the end of words.

Mock-white girl is a type of mock language that is inspired by the stereotypical "white girl's" vernacular. It commonly uses features such as 'like' in excess to imply the speaker is not well spoken or articulate. It also features [[uptalk]], [[creaky voice]], blondness and the stereotypical association with [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Mock-Hindi has taken the word 'namaste' out of context singularly and does not borrow other words or linguistic features from the language. While these are all very different mock languages features, they all do not respect the original languages and highlight the language ideology of English dominance in the US. Additionally, it does not [[Code Switch|code switch]] between the two languages, a linguistic term for switching between two languages the speaker knows, as the speaker clearly does not know [[Hindi]] when using it in such a context. 
  
== Mock Spanish ==
It has been adapted in society for people to code switch between languages but there is a boundary where "speaking" the language is inauthentic and distasteful. People tend to say "el" or add an "o" at the end of words as if they are speaking mock Spanish such as el cheapo, no problemo. The semantic domain is cheapness and it suggests that Spanish speakers have a limited amount of money and like to get things that are lower quality and low-priced.

‚ÄúMock Spanish relies upon the semiotic construction of two basic social types: the easygoing, humorous, and somewhat cosmopolitan white person and the lazy, dirty, sexually ‚Äúloose,‚Äù and unintelligent Spanish speaker.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Gordon|first=Jennifer|date=2011-11-24|title=Discipline and Disorder in the Whiteness of Mock Spanish1|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|journal=Journal of Linguistic Anthropology|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=211‚Äì229|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1395.2011.01107.x|issn=1055-1360}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- More needed. Can you outline all the rules that Hill noticed? --&gt; &lt;!-- Did you guys read Hill's "Mock Spanish: A site for the indexical reproduction of racism in American English"? Here she gives all of the features and she explains the use of Mock Spanish in terms of creating "semantic domains." As long as you cite it properly, you can include all of her findings. --&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Danke Sign.jpg|thumb|Danke Sign: This sign shows the business's affiliation to Germany. While trying to teach the English speaking viewers a German word, it does not provide any pronunciation guides or context.|227x227px]]Popular T-shirts for young women with the saying "[[namaste]] in bed". This borrows the traditional greeting from [[Hindi]] and makes it into a pun of the slang term "imma stay in bed". It also associates the Hindi word as a [[yoga]] term, though this is misappropriation as it is a term used for greeting, not concluding a yoga session. It is in relation to being lazy.

[[Cinco de Mayo]], a holiday that celebrates Mexico‚Äôs defeat of the French on May 5, 1862, has become extremely popular in the United States as a celebration based largely on the consumption of alcohol. Due to this association, the term ‚Äú[[Cinco de Drinko]]‚Äù has emerged, representing both ignorance toward the holiday‚Äôs history and an example of the ‚Äúadd ‚Äòo‚Äô‚Äù phenomenon. The ‚Äúadd ‚Äòo‚Äô‚Äù phenomenon is the practice of English speakers adding an ‚Äúo‚Äù to the end of an English word in order to give it the false appeal of being a Spanish word.

YouTuber ‚Äú[[Louise Pentland|Sprinkle of Glitter]]‚Äù would open videos until 2017 saying ‚ÄúAloha Sprinklerinos‚Äù. While not only making up a word for the name of her follower base, she used mock Hawaiian; dropping in what she perceived as a fun, innocent greeting without knowing anything about Hawaiian language, culture, context in which Hawaiians say and use the word aloha, and historical inequalities facing Hawaiians.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ec_geALd1A&lt;/ref&gt;

"Mock White Girl" is a common example that is seen in movies where the girls are speaking in standard English with creaky voice and are trying to be portrayed as privileged, popular, and in power. In the 2004 film ''[[Mean Girls]],'' character Regina George is known to be the most popular girl in school and throughout the movie she has the voice for people to recognize her status.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAOmTMCtGkI&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mock german.jpg|thumb|'Das Boot' mocks the German language for English speaking marketing purposes as "boot" does not translate into a type of footwear but to 'boat' in English. This shows the semantic domain which associates anything German with a drinking culture.]]
Bars and pubs around the world have signs that try to imitate European bar and pub culture. Oftentimes, German is incorporated due to the association of German culture with drinking. This decontextualization and use of stereotype is mock language. Danke is German for "thank you", but it is decontextualized in an English-speaking environment.

The signs are using German as an international language of beer or drinking, but "das boot" in German translates as ‚Äúthe boat‚Äù and has nothing to do with shoes or drinking. Nevertheless, it is used as the name of a drink represented by footwear. Using 'danke' in a pub may show knowledge of a direct translation, however it stereotypes drinking beer with German culture and language.

==History==
Mujib Coat is actually a moderation of [[Nehru jacket]], which used to worn by [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], the [[Prime Minister]] of [[India]] from 1947 to 1964. It is claimed by many that Sheikh Mujib used to wear the coat with six buttons, which relating to the [[Six point movement|Six-point charter]] of 1966. On the other-hand, some close relation to Bangabandhu and senior Awami League leaders claimed that there was no relation between Mujib Coat and Six-point charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.barta24.com/details/English/9177/how-many-buttons-in-mujib-coat|title=How many buttons in Mujib Coat?|newspaper=Barta 24|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since when Sheikh Mujib started to wear this coat is not known clearly, but it is alleged that when [[Awami League]] was founded in 1949 he started to wear this coat. But [[Kamal Hossain]], who was lawyer for Mujib in [[Agartala Conspiracy Case]] stated that Mujib started to wear this distinctively designed coat since 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsdhaka24.com/%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%99%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%97%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A7%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9F-%E0%A6%8F%E0%A6%B0/|title=‡¶¨‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶¨ ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶ü ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶∞‡¶π‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶Ø|newspaper=News Dhaka 24|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.jugantor.com/news-archive/editorial/2017/08/14/147956/|title=‡¶¨‡¶ô‡ßç‡¶ó‡¶¨‡¶®‡ßç‡¶ß‡ßÅ ‡¶ì ‡¶Æ‡ßÅ‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶¨ ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶ü|newspaper=Jugantor|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">The [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] '''''odium theologicum''''' (literally "theological hatred") is the name originally given to the often intense anger and [[hatred]] generated by disputes over [[theology]]. It has also been adopted to describe non-theological disputes of a rancorous nature.

[[John Stuart Mill]], discussing the fallibility of the moral consensus in his essay "On Liberty" (1859) refers scornfully to the ''odium theologicum'', saying that, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. In this essay, he takes issue with those who rely on moral feeling rather than reasoned argument to justify their beliefs.

== Academic disputes ==
The early linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] believed it necessary to develop linguistics as a cumulative, non-personal discipline; as a "genuine" science. In a talk in 1946, speaking of the development of the American Linguistics Society, he stated the fostering of such a discipline had saved it "from the blight of the ''odium theologicum'' and the postulation of schools . . . denouncing all persons who disagree or who choose to talk about something else," and he added "The struggle with recalcitrant facts, unyielding in their complexity, trains everyone who works actively in science to be humble, and accustoms him to impersonal acknowledgement of error."

Philosopher and historian of science [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] argued that scientists are strongly committed to their beliefs, theories and methods (the collection of which he termed "[[paradigm]]s"), and that science progresses mainly by [[paradigm shift]]s. He claimed that scientists with conflicting paradigms will hold to them as dearly as theologians hold to their theological paradigms.  Philosopher of math and science [[Imre Lakatos]], a student of [[Karl Popper]], described the nature of science in a similar manner.  

According to Lakatos, science progresses by continual modification or else supersession of what he termed "research programs" (roughly equivalent to Kuhn's "paradigms").  Lakatos claimed that a research program is informed by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs as well as observation of facts, and may infinitely resist [[falsifiability|falsification]] if a scientist wishes to continue holding it in spite of problems or the discovery of new evidence.  If this view is correct, science does not remedy ''odium theologicum'', it provides another field in which it may manifest.  

In the controversy over the validity of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]] the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] addressed his Newtonian opponent:
:You reproach me with "Calumny, detraction, and artifice". You recommend such means as are "innocent and just, rather than the criminal method of lessening or detracting from my opponents". You accuse me of the ''odium Theologicum'', the intemperate Zeal of Divines. . .&lt;ref&gt;''Defence of Free-Thinking in Mathematics'', 1735&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever view of science and the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] is correct, it is a fact that in the history of science there have been many instances of new theories (e.g., [[germ theory of disease]], finitude of the [[speed of light]], [[radioactivity]]) being ridiculed and shunned by the greater scientific community when first proposed or discovered, only later to be adopted as more probably accurate.

It nurtures the traditions of the [[Praxis School]] - a Yugoslav Marxist humanist philosophical movement, whose members were influenced by [[Western Marxism]] and organized the [[Praxis School#Korƒçula Summer School|Korƒçula Summer School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/srpshrva/subject/praxis/index2.htm|title=Praxis|publisher=Marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Open University of Sarajevo was an outspoken advocate of the [[2014 Bosnia and Herzegovina social riots]] and called for the continuation of direct democracy that was established by plenums during and subsequently after the riots. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkanist.net/open-university-bosnia-herzegovina/|title=Against Passivity: the Open University in Bosnia and Herzegovina|publisher=balkanist.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school runs a [[Free-to-view]] platform that streams all of its content online, dubbed in various languages, and archives it on its website and [[Youtube]] channel.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Otvoreni.univerzitet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lecture at the Open University of Sarajevo, 2016.]] --&gt;
The Open University of Sarajevo was founded in 2011 by a select group of leftist professors from the [[University of Sarajevo]] in cooperation with the [[Friedrich Ebert Foundation]], the [[Youth Initiative for Human Rights]], the ''Crvena'' art and culture association, the [[Pantheon-Sorbonne University]] and the [[Krokodil Literary Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/otvoreni-univerzitet-s-kljucnim-pitanjima-sta-da-se-radi/280685|title=Otvoreni univerzitet s kljuƒçnim pitanjima: ≈†ta da se radi|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The initial group of founders included prof. Dr. [[Asim Mujkiƒá]] from the Faculty of Philosophy, prof. Dr. [[Enver Kazaz]] from the Comparative Literature Departement of the Faculty of Philosophy and prof. Dr. [[Dino Abazoviƒá]] from the [[Faculty of Political Science in Sarajevo|Faculty of Political Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tacno.net/sarajevo/dino-abazovic-u-zizi-mora-biti-socijalna-pravda-a-ne-etnonacionalna/|title=Dino Abazoviƒá: U ≈æi≈æi mora biti socijalna pravda, a ne etnonacionalna|publisher=Tacno.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;     Furthermore, the founding committee was joined by numerous other public intellectuals from the Former Yugoslavia, including Sarajevo-born writer and scholar [[Igor ≈†tiks]], award-winning Bosnian film director [[Jasmila ≈Ωbaniƒá]], Croatian linguist [[Snje≈æana Kordiƒá]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ba.n1info.com/a146016/Vijesti/Vijesti/Imena-potpisnika-Deklaracije-o-zajednickom-jeziku.html|title=Imena potpisnika Deklaracije o zajedniƒçkom jeziku|publisher=N1info.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first edition of the school was held from 12 to 15 December 2011 in smaller venues, emulating the leftist caf√© tradition of the 1960s, before [[Nihad Kre≈°evljakoviƒá]], the director of the [[Sarajevo War Theatre]] and grandson of Bosnian historian [[Hamdija Kre≈°evljakoviƒá]] indirectly joined the project and brought it to his theatre two years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sartr.ba/otvoreni-univerzitet-2017-sta-da-se-radi/|title=Otvoreni univerzitet 2017|publisher=Sarajevo War Theatre Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the school established the Center for Interactive Education and Social Action (CODA) with the goal of improving democratic values and promoting social, economic and political participation and emancipation in Bosnian society. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otvoreni-magazin.net/coda/|title=CODA|publisher=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2015 edition was the first to include a wider multimedia program and a theatrical performance directed by Serbian experimental theatre director [[Bojan ƒêorƒëev]] titled ''[[Bojan ƒêorƒëev#Selected Works|Nije to crvena, to je krv]]'' (That's not red, that's blood). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediantrop.rankomunitic.org/bojan-dordev-nije-to-crvena-to-je-krv|title=Bojan ƒêorƒëev - Nije to crvena, to je krv|publisher=mediantrop.rankomunitic.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and venues==

The school is organized every December and lasts for four days. Each year's program is formed around a particular question such as ''What are we afraid of?'', subsequently forming topics based on said statement (''Why are we afraid of...Yugoslavism?''; ''Why are we afraid of...Marxism?''; ''Why are we afraid of...immigrants?'' etc.) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otvoreni-magazin.net/12/11/2016/5-otvoreni-univerzitet-fasizam-oko-nas-kako-ga-pobijediti/|title=How to defeat fascism?|publisher=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and lectures are held in three venues, with the main stage being the [[Sarajevo War Theatre]]. The other two venues are the [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Historical Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Each day's events are organized sequentially starting from the morning. The school follows an interactive and multimedia format with theatre plays, film projections, poetry readings and interactive games being held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://efm.ba/2017/11/06/6-otvoreni-univerzitet-sta-da-se-radi/|title=The European Union Identity Trading Game|publisher=Efm.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theatre segments often follow the form of [[Augusto Boal]]'s [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], and are directed by notable theatre directors from the [[Former Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/kultura/otvoreni-univerzitet-izaberite-predavanje-za-sebe/133483|title=Otvoreni univerzitet: Izaberite predavanje za sebe|publisher=Radio Sarajevo}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Each day's activities are concluded in the Sarajevo War Theatre where the main [[Round table (discussion)|round table discussions]], lectures, panels and Q&amp;A's are held. An evening symposium tops off the day. Another major aspect of the school's format is the fact that it does not require enrollment or any form of participant registration, instead opting for a [[grassroots]] and [[Plenum (meeting)|plenum]] format. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://24sata.info/vijesti/bosna-i-hercegovina/214163-foto-otvoreni-univerzitet-sta-je-novo-u-novim-drustvenim-pokretima.html|title=Otvoreni univerzitet: ≈†ta je novo u novim dru≈°tvenim pokretima|publisher=24sata.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5937">A '''phonetic complement''' is a phonetic symbol used to disambiguate word characters ([[logogram]]s) that have multiple readings, in mixed logographic-phonetic scripts such as [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s, [[cuneiform script|Akkadian cuneiform]], [[Japanese writing system|Japanese]], and [[Maya script|Mayan]].  Often they reenforce the communication of the [[ideogram]] by repeating the first or last syllable in the term.

Written English has few logograms, primarily numerals, and therefore few phonetic complements. An example is the ''nd'' of ''2nd'' 'second', which avoids ambiguity with 2 standing for the word 'two'. In addition to numerals, other examples include [[Xmas]], [[Xianity]], and [[wikt:xing#English|Xing]] for [[Christmas]], [[Christianity]], and Crossing ‚Äì note the separate readings ''Christ'' and ''Cross''.

==In cuneiform==
In Sumerian, the single word ''kur'' had two meanings: 'hill' and 'country'.  Akkadian, however, had separate words for these two meanings: ''≈°ad√∫'' 'hill' and ''mƒÅtu'' 'country'. When Sumerian cuneiform was adapted for writing Akkadian, this was ambiguous because both words were written with the same character (conventionally transcribed KUR, after its Sumerian pronunciation). To alert the reader as to which Akkadian word was intended, the phonetic complement ''-√∫'' was written after KUR if hill was intended, so that the characters KUR-√∫ were pronounced ''≈°ad√∫,'' whereas KUR without a phonetic complement was understood to mean ''mƒÅtu'' 'country'.

Phonetic complements also indicated the Akkadian nominative and genitive cases. Similarly, [[Hittite cuneiform]] occasionally uses phonetic complements to attach Hittite case endings to [[Sumerogram]]s and [[Akkadogram]]s. 

Phonetic complements should not be confused with [[determinative]]s (which were also used to disambiguate) since determinatives were used specifically to indicate the category of the word they preceded or followed.  For example, the sign [[Dingir|DINGIR]] often precedes names of gods, as LUGAL does for kings.  It is believed that determinatives were not pronounced.  &lt;!--TODO: List of phonetic complements in [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]--&gt;

==In Japanese==
{{main|Okurigana}}
As in Akkadian, Japanese borrowed a logographic script, [[Chinese character|Chinese]], designed for a very different language. The Chinese phonetic components built into these ''[[kanji]]'' do not work when they are pronounced in Japanese, and there is not a one-to-one relationship between them and the Japanese words they represent. 

For example, the kanji Áîü, pronounced ''sh≈ç'' or ''sei'' in [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|borrowed Chinese vocabulary]], stands for several native Japanese words as well. When these words have inflectional endings (verbs/adjectives and adverbs), the end of the stem is written phonetically:
*Áîü ''nama'' 'raw' or ''ki'' 'alive'
*Áîü„ÅÜ [Áîüu] ''o-u'' 'expand'
*Áîü„Åç„Çã [Áîükiru] ''i-kiru'' 'live'
*Áîü„Åã„Åô [Áîükasu] ''i-kasu'' 'arrange'
*Áîü„Åë„Çã [Áîükeru] ''i-keru'' 'live'
*Áîü„ÇÄ„ÄÄ[Áîümu] ''u-mu'' 'produce'
*Áîü„Åæ„Çå„Çã or Áîü„Çå„Çã [Áîümareru or Áîüreru] ''u-mareru'' or ''uma-reru'' 'be born'
*Áîü„Åà„Çã [Áîüeru] ''ha-eru'' 'grow' (intransitive)
*Áîü„ÇÑ„Åô [Áîüyasu] ''ha-yasu'' 'grow' (transitive)
as well as the hybrid Chinese-Japanese word
*Áîü„Åò„Çã [Áîüjiru] ''sh≈ç-jiru'' 'occur'
Note that some of these verbs share a kanji reading (''i,'' ''u,'' and ''ha''), and okurigana are conventionally picked to maximize these sharings.

These phonetic characters are called ''[[okurigana]].'' They are used even when the inflection of the stem can be determined by a following inflectional suffix, so the primary function of ''okurigana'' for many kanji is that of a phonetic complement. 

Generally it is the final syllable containing the inflectional ending is written phonetically. However, in adjectival verbs ending in ''-shii,'' and in those verbs ending in ''-ru'' in which this syllable drops in derived nouns, the final two syllables are written phonetically. There are also irregularities. For example, the word ''umareru'' 'be born' is derived from ''umu'' 'to bear, to produce'. As such, it may be written Áîü„Åæ„Çå„Çã [Áîümareru], reflecting its derivation, or Áîü„Çå„Çã [Áîüreru], as with other verbs ending in elidable ''ru.''

==In Chinese==
{{main|Phono-semantic}}
Chinese never developed a system of purely phonetic characters. Instead, about 90% of Chinese characters are compounds of a determinative (called a '[[Radical (Chinese character)|radical]]'), which may not exist independently, and a phonetic complement indicates the approximate pronunciation of the morpheme. However, the phonetic element is basic, and these might be better thought of as characters used for multiple near homonyms, the identity of which is constrained by the determiner. Due to sound changes over the last several millennia, the phonetic complements are not a reliable guide to pronunciation.

==In the Maya Script==
The [[Maya script|Maya Script]], the logosyllabic orthography of the [[Maya Civilization]], used phonetic complements extensively&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unc.edu/~davidmm/FullComplementspaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and phonetic complements could be used synharmonically or disharmonically.&lt;ref&gt;DISHARMONY IN MAYA HIEROGLYPHIC WRITING: LINGUISTIC CHANGE AND CONTINUITY IN CLASSIC SOCIETY&lt;/ref&gt; The former is exemplified by the placement of the [[Syllabary|syllabogram]] for ''ma'' underneath the [[logogram]] for "Jaguar" (in [[Classic Maya]], ''BALAM''): thus, though pronounced "''BALAM''", the word for "jaguar" was spelled "''BALAM-m(a)''". Disharmonic spellings also existed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.famsi.org/research/pitts/MayaGlyphsBook1Sect1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the Maya Script.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mesoweb.com/resources/handbook/WH2005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political gaffe''' is an error made by a politician.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/gaffe?q=gaffe |title=Definition for gaffe ‚Äì Oxford Dictionaries Online (World English) |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gaffe'' is of French origin, originally a 'boat hook' as in '[[gaff rig]]' where the relation is apparent, but the sense association to a blundering remark is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=gaffe|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kinsley gaffe occurs when a political gaffe reveals some truth that a politician did not intend to admit.&lt;ref name="Webster"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gaffe  | first=Merriam | last=Webster  |authorlink=Merriam Webster| date= June 3, 1972  | title=Merriam Webster definition of Gaffe |publisher=[[Merriam Webster Dictionary]] | accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goddard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://politicaldictionary.com/index/g/ |first1=Taegan |last1=Goddard |work=Taegan Goddard's Political Dictionary |publisher=[[Political Wire]] |title=Kinsley Gaffe |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term comes from journalist [[Michael Kinsley]], who said, "A gaffe is when a politician tells the truth ‚Äì some obvious truth he isn't supposed to say."&lt;ref name="Kinsley"&gt;{{citation |first=Michael |last=Kinsley|date=April 23, 1988 |title= Commentary: The gaffer speaks |newspaper=[[The Times]] |accessdate =2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="friedman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2011/08/word-of-the-week-kinsley-gaffe.html |title=Word of the Week: Kinsley Gaffe |first1=Nancy |last1=Friedman |date=August 22, 2011 |work=Fritinancy |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66ouyRf44?url=http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2011/08/word-of-the-week-kinsley-gaffe.html |archivedate=April 10, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term gaffe may be used to describe an inadvertent statement by a politician that the politician believes is true while the politician has not fully analyzed the consequences of publicly stating it. Another definition is a statement made when the politician privately believes it to be true, realizes the dire consequences of saying it, and yet inadvertently utters, in public, the unutterable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Brill makes a "Kinsley gaffe" |url=http://sheckymagazine.com/2012/01/brill-makes-a-kinsley-gaffe/ |first1=Brian |last1=McKim |first2=Tracy |last2=Skene |publisher=Shecky Magazine.com|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=May 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition is a politician's statement of what is on his or her mind{{mdash}}this may or may not be inadvertent{{mdash}}thereby leading to a ritualized 'gaffe dance' between candidates.

Kinsley himself posed the question: "Why should something a politician says by accident automatically be taken as a better sign of his or her real thinking than something he or she says on purpose?"&lt;ref name="kinsley2"/&gt;

[[Steven Pinker]] says that politicians use vague and indirect language to avoid making concrete statements, and that lazy journalists base political coverage around "gaffe spotting" rather than analysis of political platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS4xVcko9qw|title=Political Rhetoric, Explained - Steven Pinker|date=14 October 2008|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''portrayal of Native Americans in film''' has been fed by [[stereotype]]s, which has raised allegations of racism. Traditionally, the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] archetype has been that of a violent, uncivilized villain, juxtaposed next to the archetypal hero: the virtuous, white [[Anglo-Saxon]] settler. However, a growing number of pictures in the latter half of the twentieth century and beyond have portrayed [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] in a more historically accurate light.

== Animated film ==
''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' is a Disney film involving Native Americans. A major scene in ''Peter Pan'' involves the [[Lost Boys (Peter Pan)|Lost Boys]] and [[Peter Pan]] celebrating at the Native Americans' camp after Peter rescues [[Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)|Tiger Lily]], the daughter of the chief, from [[Captain Hook]].  While they are there they sing "What Makes the Red Man Red?"

''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' is another Disney film that portrays Native Americans. The film focuses on the European's voyage to the Americas in search of gold. When they arrive, they come across a Native American tribe that is already living on that land. There is conflict between the two groups, both hating the other. The Europeans want gold and the Native Americans want their land and their livelihoods. Just before a battle between the two groups begins, Pocahontas, a young Native American woman, saves the life of a European man, and prevents the war from happening.  Pocahontas portrays Native Americans and Europeans with just as much guile. One scene involves both the Europeans and the Native Americans singing "Savages" about the other group.

==Negative portrayals==
Traditionally, Native Americans have been portrayed as the uncivilized villains in film. According to Beverly R. Singer, "Despite the fact that a diversity of indigenous peoples had a legal and historical significance in the formation of every new country founded in the western hemisphere, in the United States and Canada the term 'Indians' became a hegemonic designation implying that they were all the same in regards to culture, behavior, language, and social organization. The view of 'Indians' as savage and uncivilized was repeated in early films and crystallized the image of 'Indians' as dangerous and unacceptable to the normative lives of European immigrants whose lives appeared in films to be more valuable than those of the indigenous people they were colonizing."&lt;ref&gt;Beverly R. Singer: ''Native Americans and Cinema''. In: [[Barry Keith Grant]] (ed. in chief): ''Schirmer Encyclopedia of Film: Volume 3: Independent Film‚ÄìRoad Movies''. [[Farmington Hills, Michigan|Farmington Hills, MI]]: Schirmer Reference, 2007, pp. 211‚Äì214, here p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most films involving Native Americans, they wear clothes made from animal skins, carry spears, and enjoy fighting with most strangers who come into their land. The [[warrior]]s fight with [[arrowhead]] knives and brute strength. The settlers carry guns and weapons with them wherever they go in [[self-defense]].

It is known from Lewis and Clark's diaries that Sacajawea was a key player in their explorations. However, Hollywood has trivialized her importance. The film ''Far Horizons'' is a fictionalized account of Sacajawea, played by Donna Reed, about the Lewis and Clark expedition. It is known that she was a strong, independent, and intelligent woman. However, Hollywood portrays Sacajawea's life centered on a love story with Clark, played by Charlton Heston. In the film, Sacajawea and Clark realize that they can never fulfill their love and be together because of racial prejudices and Clark's prominent position in white society. Sacajawea finally makes the ultimate sacrifice and returns alone to her tribe while Clark returns to white society and his white fianc√©e. There are in fact no records of a romantic relationship between Sacajawea and Clark.

In the sequel to Disney's ''Pocahontas'', ''[[Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World]]'', the first time Pocahontas sets foot on English soil, she is dressed in her revealing one-strap dress, while Englishmen and Englishwomen look at her with disdain and disgust while she admires everything London has to offer. She is unconsciously compared to a wild animal running amok. It is a classic scene of the inferior Native American woman doting over her white-European surrounding while Europeans view her as an excited savage enamored by their world.


Literary artists found various ways of dealing with the "culturally troublesome conclusion" that the story of Pocahontas presents (Tilton, 59). The way many artists dealt with the troublesome conclusions, though, was to change aspects of the story. Therefore, authors are continually producing their own works, but they are not original or based on solely history or fantasy. The mix of history and creativity of a story rooted in historical falsity serves to perpetuate stereotypes beyond intention. This becomes harmful when multiple detrimental intentions become more and more intertwined into the American narrative, and harder to tease out from accuracy.
[Tilton, Robert S. Pocahontas: The Evolution of an American Narrative. New York: Cambridge UP, 1994. Print.]

==Positive portrayals==
The first film to feature Native American actors was ''[[An Indian Love Story]]'', in 1911. The film was also designed to provide an authentic background showing the way of life of Native Americans and their communities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m1-JDrrM6mIC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=an+indian+love+story+1911&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5N744kARIK&amp;sig=BicLjC7QcNxo27TdYOU6kPdB-S0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBmoVChMI94W57fycyQIVCBo-Ch1iTASd#v=onepage&amp;q=an%20indian%20love%20story%201911&amp;f=false|title=Making the White Man's Indian: Native American and Hollywood Movies|date=2005|publisher=Westport:An Imprint of Greenwood|pages=11|last1=Aleiss|first1=Angela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some films, Native Americans are viewed as intelligent and spiritual. They are the innocent victims of what the white [[settlers]] are doing to them. One example of this can be found in the movie ''[[Dances with Wolves]]''. One scene shows the U.S. soldiers capturing the protagonist of the film, John Dunbar, and taking him as a prisoner away from his Native American land. Out of nowhere, the Native Americans race onto the scene and kill all of the U.S. soldiers while none of the Native Americans get killed. Some of them receive injuries, but they just ignore the pain and do not seem to even realize that they have been hurt. They are portrayed as being strong and immune to the pain.

The final credits of the film explain what happens after the movie. It describes the history of the [[Sioux]] people after the film takes place:

"Thirteen years later, their homes destroyed, their buffalo gone, the last band of free Sioux submitted to white authority at Fort Robinson, Nebraska. The great horse culture of the plains was gone and the American frontier was soon to pass into history."&lt;ref&gt;''Dances with Wolves''.  Dir. [[Kevin Costner]].  Tig Productions. [[Orion Pictures]], 1990.  Film.&lt;/ref&gt;

The film ''[[The New World (2005 film)|The New World]]'' is another movie about Native Americans.  It is the quasi-fictitious story of [[Pocahontas]] and [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]]. John Smith arrives with the European settlers and gets captured by a Native American tribe. While there, Smith is accepted by the Native Americans and falls in love with one of the young women, Pocahontas. When he is describing the Native American tribe he explains that, "They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in all guile and trickery. The words denoting lying, deceit, greed, envy, slander, and forgiveness have never been heard. They have no jealousy, or sense of possession."&lt;ref&gt;''The New World''. Dir. [[Terrence Malick]]. [[New Line Cinema]], 2006.  Film.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Native Americans portrayed in this film were peaceful and gentle people. They were not evil; they were just different from the white settlers.

Part of the field called Human Systems Intervention, process consultation is a philosophy of helping, a general theory and methodology of intervening ([[Edgar Schein|Schein]], Process Consultations, 1992 revisited). 

A process consultant is a highly qualified professional that has insights into and understands the psychosocial dynamics of working with various client systems such as whole organizations, groups, and individuals. 

Given the complex nature of intervening, a process consultant's expertise includes the following (and many other) aspects:
a)	works concomitantly with groups and individuals (managers/directors) towards a larger change process such as strategic visioning, strategic planning, etc.
b)	based on the context, selects from a variety of methods, tools and change theories a 'facilitative intervention' that will most benefit the client system;
c)	stays aware of covert organizational processes, group dynamics, and interpersonal issues;

==Role in Organizational Development==

In [[organization development]], a process consultant is a specialized type of consultant who acts as a [[facilitator]] to help groups deal with issues involving the process in a meeting, rather than with the actual tasks themselves.
==Role in Small Group Development==
A process consultant may be used at any time during the [[Stages of Group Development]]. Occasionally, a process consultant is used when a group is either in its formative stage, or normative stage. However, more often than not, they participate when the group is in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]].

==Role in Conflict Resolution==
Often a group finds itself in conflict over [[fact]]s, [[goal]]s, [[Scientific method|methods]] or [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. It is the role of the process consultant to help the group reach [[consensus]] over the type of conflict it faces.

Once the type of conflict is identified, the process consultant then helps the group work through the steps required to break the impasse.

It is important to note that the process consultant's role is not to solve the problem, but to help the group solve its own problem.  The reason for this is because it is the group, not the consultant who will have to live with the [[Consequentialism|consequences]] of its decision.

==Role in Conflict Management==

Occasionally, due to the nature of conflict, the process consultant may need to guide the group toward [[conflict management]] rather than [[conflict resolution]].

==Techniques Used==
Initially a process consultant will not lead or participate in a group meeting, but rather will act as an [[observation|observer]]. During this time, they observe the [[group dynamics]] to determine what [[interpersonal]] relationships may contribute to the group's issues.

At some point, s/he will begin to actively participate in the meeting, by asking clarifying questions or [[paraphrasing]].  Eventually, s/he will make his/her observations known by giving the group [[feedback]].

==Education Required==
To enter this field, a background in [[psychology]] and [[small group learning]] is helpful. Experience in reading [[body language]] and possessing [[Analytical skills]] is also useful. However, receiving some training in [[experiential education]] will probably be the most beneficial.

'''Ready-made garments''' are [[mass production|mass-produced]] finished [[textile]] products of the [[clothing industry]]. They are not custom [[tailoring|tailored]] according to measurements, but rather generalized according to [[anthropometric]] studies. They are made from many different [[fabrics]] and [[yarns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tis-gdv.de/tis_e/ware/textil/konfektion/konfektion.htm|title=Ready-made garments|website=www.tis-gdv.de|access-date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their characteristics depend on the fibers used in their manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/endpovertyinsouthasia/important-role-ready-made-garments-bangladesh%27s-export-earnings|title=The important role of ready made garments to Bangladesh‚Äôs export earnings|website=worldbank.org|publisher=[[World Bank]]|author=Abul Basher|date=26 June 2009|access-date=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ready-made garments are divided into the following types: outer clothing, which includes workwear and uniforms, leisure wear, and sportswear (e.g., suits, pants, dresses, ladies' suits, [[blouse|blouses]], [[blazer]]s, jackets, [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigans]], [[pullovers]], coats, sports jackets, skirts, shirts, ties,  jeans, shorts, T-shirts, [[polo shirts]], sports shirts, [[tracksuits]], bathing shorts, bathing suits, and bikinis); and undergarments, which include jersey goods and lingerie (e.g. underpants, undershirts, briefs, socks, stockings, and pantyhose).{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==History==
The first ready-made garment factory was established in New York in 1831. During the American Civil War the need for ready-made uniforms helped the garment sector grow in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=editor|first1=Eric Arneson,|title=Encyclopedia of U.S. labor and working-class history.|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=9780415968263|page=496|url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=zEWsZ81Bd3YC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;dq=%22Ready+Made+Garments%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzgeahUKEwjD6cquvvDGAhUEupQKHQiRA5M#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ready%20Made%20Garments%22&amp;f=false|access-date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the nineteenth century there were changes in societal views towards ready-made garments: They were no longer seen as only for the lower classes but also for the middle classes. This trend started in the United States. In the beginning they were more popular with men than women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aindow|first1=Rosy|title=Dress and identity in British literary culture, 1870-1914|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham, Surrey|isbn=0754661458|page=37|url=https://books.google.com.bd/books?id=jWVYkHeKQGUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=%22Ready+Made+Garments%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwBWoVChMI0pHRjb7wxgIVhBSUCh0AmAT1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ready%20Made%20Garments%22&amp;f=false|access-date=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1860s, twenty-five percent of garments produced in the US were ready-made, but by 1890, the portion had risen to sixty percent.

'''Ronda de Salsa''', also known as Ronda Manila or simply "Ronda," is a group dance inspired by [[Rueda de Casino]]. The dance was invented at the Asian Social Institute in an attempt to energize a disintegrating Filipino-Hispanic culture through a fusion of a local Hispanic dance called [[Pandanggo]] and a popular modern dance, [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], which for decades has been making waves in other Hispanic countries.&lt;ref&gt;An article Ronda de Salsa appears at the editorials of SalsaPowers.com http://www.salsapower.com/editorials/manila_ronda.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The five simple basic combinations or combo, are: Gising, Pule, Patria, Lakambini and Dolorosa.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98211">'''Self-disclosure''' is a process of communication by which one person reveals information about himself or herself to another.  The information can be descriptive or evaluative, and can include thoughts, feelings, aspirations, goals, failures, successes, fears, and dreams, as well as one's likes, dislikes, and favorites.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ignatius|first=Emmi|author2=Marja Kokkonen |title=Factors contributing to verbal self-disclosure|journal=Nordic Psychology|year=2007|volume=59|issue=4|pages=362‚Äì391|doi=10.1027/1901-2276.59.4.362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social penetration theory]] posits that there are two dimensions to self-disclosure: breadth and depth. Both are crucial in developing a fully intimate relationship. The range of topics discussed by two individuals is the breadth of disclosure. The degree to which the information revealed is private or personal is the depth of that disclosure. It is easier for breadth to be expanded first in a relationship because of its more accessible features; it consists of outer layers of personality and everyday lives, such as occupations and preferences. Depth is more difficult to reach, and includes painful memories and more unusual traits that we might hesitate to share with others.  We reveal ourselves most thoroughly and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.&lt;ref name="Tolstedt 1984 84‚Äì90"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolstedt|first=Betsy E.|author2=Joseph P. Stokes |title=Self-disclosure, Intimacy, and the Depenetration Process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=46|issue=1|pages=84‚Äì90|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.1.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"&gt;Altman, I., &amp; Taylor, D. A. (1973). ''Social penetration: The development of interpersonal relationships.'' New York: Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-disclosure is an important building block for [[intimate relationship|intimacy]] and cannot be achieved without it. Reciprocal and appropriate self-disclosure is expected. Self-disclosure can be assessed by an analysis of cost and rewards which can be further explained by [[social exchange theory]]. Most self-disclosure occurs early in relational development, but more intimate self-disclosure occurs later.

==In intimate relationships==

===Social penetration theory===

[[Social penetration theory]] states that the development of a relationship is closely linked to systematic changes in communication. Relationships generally begin with the exchange of superficial information and gradually move on to more meaningful conversations. In order to develop a more intimate relationship, partners must increase the breadth and depth of their conversations. Breadth includes the variety of topics two people discuss and depth is the personal significance of these topics.&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"/&gt;

Altman and Taylor use a wedge to explain this theory. In this example, the beginning of a relationship is represented by a narrow and shallow wedge because only a few topics are discussed. However, as the relationship goes on, the wedge should become broader and deeper, including more topics of personal significance. The wedge must drive through three "layers" in order for intimacy to develop. The first is superficial "small talk" with little personal information about the speakers. The next layer is intimate, with increasing breadth and depth and more personal details.  The third is the very intimate level, where extremely private information is shared.&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"/&gt;

Intimacy in these relationships can develop only if the persons involved reciprocate disclosures. Intimacy will not develop if only one partner discloses and the other continues to reveal only superficial information. Reciprocity must be gradual and match the intimacy of the other's disclosures.  Too rapid, too personal disclosure creates an imbalance in a relationship that can be discomfiting. This gradual process varies from relationship to relationship and can depend on the specific partner with whom one is communicating.&lt;ref name = "AltmanTaylor"/&gt;

===Reciprocity and intimacy===
[[Reciprocity (social psychology)|Reciprocity]] is a positive response from the person with whom one is sharing information, whereby the person who received the disclosure self-discloses in turn. Self-disclosure usually influences whether two people will want to interact again. Research has shown that when one person self-discloses, another person is more likely to self-disclose. Initially, the process is started by one partner's reveal of personal information to the other partner. In return, the other will disclose something and behave in such a way so as to be responsive to the initial disclosure's content, while also conveying a degree of understanding and validation for what was revealed.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Research has found that people who consider themselves to be high in disclosure are likely to be good at eliciting more disclosure from those with whom they interact.&lt;ref name="Sprecher"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sprecher|first=Susan|author2=Susan Hendrick |title=Self-Disclosure in Intimate Relationships: Associations With Individual and Relationship Characteristics Over Time|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|year=2004|volume=6|issue=23|pages=857‚Äì877|doi=10.1521/jscp.23.6.857.54803}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three theories describe reciprocity: The social attraction-trust hypothesis, [[social exchange theory]] and the [[norm of reciprocity]]. The social attraction-trust hypothesis says that people disclose to one another because they believe the person who disclosed to them likes and trusts them. Social exchange theory explains that people attempt to maintain equality in self-disclosure because an imbalance in this makes them uncomfortable. The third explanation, the norm of reciprocity, argues that reciprocating disclosure is a [[social norm]] and violating it makes a person uncomfortable.

There are two types of reciprocity: turn-taking reciprocity and extended reciprocity. Turn-taking is when partners immediately self-disclose with one another and extended is when disclosure happens over a period of time, in which one partner may be the only one disclosing while the other just listens. Those who engage in turn taking reciprocity are shown to like their interaction partners more than those who engage in extended reciprocity. Turn taking partners are also shown to feel closer and similar to each other and to enjoy the other's company more than extended pairs. This can be explained by the social attraction-trust hypothesis because the partners perceive the discloser as liking and trusting them because they disclosed personal information. Those who engage in extended reciprocity are affected by the social exchange theory and the norm of reciprocity which can account for the lower degree of liking. Since extended reciprocity limits reciprocating disclosure it creates an imbalance in disclosure which violates both of these theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|author=Sprecher, S., Treger, S., Wondra, J. D., Hilaire, N., &amp; Wallpe, K.|title=Taking turns: Reciprocal self-disclosure promotes liking in initial interactions.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.03.017|volume=49|pages=860‚Äì866}}&lt;/ref&gt; That said, people usually report that they themselves are disclosing more than is the other partner. This is called perceived partner reciprocity, and it is critical to the self-disclosure process in developing relationships.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

Two key components for intimacy are disclosure and partner responsiveness.  It is extremely important that when a speaker discloses personal information their partner also discloses something personally relevant. It is also essential that the listener understand, validate and care about what the speaker is disclosing. If the speaker does not feel accepted by the listener then they may not disclose something to them in the future, which stops the development of intimacy. Emotional disclosures are also shown to foster intimacy more than factual disclosures. Factual disclosures reveal facts and information about the self (e.g., "I am divorced from my husband.") while emotional disclosures reveal a person's feelings, thoughts and judgments (e.g., "My divorce was so painful it has made it difficult for me to trust a romantic partner again"). Emotional disclosures can increase intimacy because they allow the listener to confirm and support the discloser's self-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Laurenceau, J., Barrett, L., &amp; Pietromonaco, P. R.|title=Intimacy as an interpersonal process: The importance of self-disclosure, partner disclosure, and perceived partner responsiveness in interpersonal exchanges.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1998|volume=74|issue=5|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.5.1238|pmid=9599440|pages=1238‚Äì51}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The transition from sharing impersonal to personal facts is crucial to the building of an intimate relationship. One must feel accepted in order to feel comfortable enough to self-disclose. Without acceptance, one partner will withdraw and fail to reveal personal facts within the relationship. Sharing ourselves also brings us out of our imaginary worlds and allows us to see the realities of the world we live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Matthew|title=The Seven Levels of Intimacy|year=2005|publisher=Fireside Book|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; We are most comfortable sharing with those whom we like and feel like us. There is also evidence that someone who introduces himself with more intimacy is more likely to facilitate self-disclosure and intimacy with the recipient. Thus, self-disclosure breeds intimacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ignatius|first=E.|author2=M. Kokkonen |title=Factors contributing to verbal self-disclosure|journal=Nordic Psychology|year=2007|volume=4|issue=59|pages=362‚Äì391|doi=10.1027/1901-2276.59.4.362}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is why we reveal ourselves most and discuss the widest range of topics with our spouses and loved ones.&lt;ref name="Tolstedt 1984 84‚Äì90"/&gt;

We often perceive our own self-disclosure as higher than our partner's, which can lead to ill feelings. It is hard for humans to accurately judge how fully another is disclosing to them.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

===Individual differences in reciprocity===

====Self-monitoring====

According to Snyder (1974) self-monitoring is the personality difference in individual's degree of preference to both self-expression and self-presentation.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, E.R., Mackie, D.M., Claypool, H.M. (2015): Social Psychology (4th Edition). Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;[[Self-monitoring]] is a form of impression management in which a person examines a situation and behaves accordingly. Although self-monitoring is measured on a continuous scale, researchers often group individuals into two types: high and low self-monitors. Someone who is a high self-monitor tends to examine a situation more closely and adjusts their behavior in order "fit in" with others in the scenario. High self-monitors tend to behave in a friendlier and extroverted manner in order to be well liked by peers. A low self-monitor does not do this and tends to follow their own emotions and thoughts when behaving in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snyder|first=Mark|title=The self-monitoring of expressive behavior|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|volume=30|pages=526‚Äì537|doi=10.1037/h0037039}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since they are more attuned to social cues, high self-monitors are generally better at assessing the level of intimacy a partner is disclosing. By noticing these cues, high self-monitors tend to reciprocate equally in their self-disclosures.&lt;ref name = "self-monitoring"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaffer|first=David R. |author2=Smith, Jonathan E. |author3=Tomarelli, Michele |title=Self-monitoring as a determinant of self-disclosure reciprocity during the acquaintance process.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1982|volume=43|issue=1|pages=163‚Äì175|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.43.1.163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This can be explained by the norm of reciprocity because the high self-monitors can pick up on these cues easily and know that they need to respond with their own disclosure. It can also be explained by social exchange theory. Research shows that high self-monitors are more uncomfortable when paired with a low self-monitor because low self-monitors do not tend to disclose intimate details so the balance in the conversation is uneven. High self-monitors are also shown to be the "pace-setters" of the conversation and generally initiate and maintain the flow of a conversation.&lt;ref name="self-monitoring"/&gt;

====Mood====

Those in a positive mood have been found to disclose more intimately than those in a negative mood. This may be because of informational effects whereby happy people tend to access more positive information which leads them to behave in a more optimistic and confident manner. Unhappy people tend to access more negative information which increases the likelihood of cautious, pessimistic and restrained communications.&lt;ref name = "Forgas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgas|first=Joseph P.|title=Affective influences on self-disclosure: Mood effects on the intimacy and reciprocity of disclosing personal information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2011|volume=100|issue=3|pages=449‚Äì461|doi=10.1037/a0021129|pmid=21171788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This may also be due to processing effects, in particular assimilation and accommodation effects. Assimilation effects rely on an individual's prior knowledge to guide their behavior in a situation and accommodation effects rely on careful monitoring of a situation and a greater attention to concrete information. Assimilative processing is ideal for safe, routine situations while accommodative processing is for problematic situations. Happy people tend to use assimilative processing, which leads to more daring and direct disclosures, while unhappy people use accommodative processing, which leads them to be more cautious in their disclosures. These accommodating effects for unhappy people tend to increase reciprocity because these individuals will match the level of disclosure from their partner but will not go beyond that.&lt;ref name="Forgas"/&gt;

However, it can also be said that being distressed, anxious, or fearful (which would be classified as negative mood states) can accelerate disclosure as well. The exception to this is [[loneliness]], for lonely individuals have shown decreased rates of self-disclosure.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391" /&gt;

====Gender====

Whether or not one sex shares more readily is a heated debate in social psychology, but sex-role identities play a large part in the amount one chooses to reveal to another. [[Androgynous]] people disclose more intimately across contexts than do notably masculine and feminine people.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391" /&gt;

Research findings on gender differences in self-disclosure are mixed. Women self-disclose to enhance a relationship, while men self-disclose relative to their control and vulnerabilities. Men initially disclose more in heterosexual relationships. Women tend to put more emphasis on intimate communication with same-sex friends than men do.&lt;ref&gt;Farber A. Barry. Self Disclosure in Psychotherapy. The Guilford Press. New York. 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In relationships, there are still other factors that contribute to the likelihood of disclosure. While people with high self-esteem tend to reveal themselves more, the reverse is also true, where self-esteem is enhanced by a partner's disclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Mark|title=Importance of Self Disclosure in Modern Relationships|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/importance-self-disclosure-modern-relationships-mark-taylor|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In men, self-disclosure and the level of disclosure they perceive from their wives is positively correlated with their [[self-esteem]]. For both genders, the state of a relationship and the feelings associated with it are major contributors to how much each spouse reveals himself or herself. Husbands and wives in a relationship marked with satisfaction, love, and commitment rate their own levels of disclosure highly as well as their perceptions of their spouses' disclosures.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

====Additional individual differences====

Being [[shyness|shy]] decreases self-disclosure. Among men, those who are or appear more "tough" are less likely to disclose and express themselves.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391" /&gt;

[[Motivation]] for disclosure is also critical: does the individual need to present himself or herself in a certain way in order to gain certain benefits, and does the self-disclosure match the person's sense of ideal self? We like to present ourselves in ways that we feel are congruent with our own [[self-concepts]], and what we tell others about ourselves often becomes how we actually are.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391" /&gt;

====Sexual====

Sexual self-disclosure is the act of revealing one's sexual preferences to another, usually to one's sexual partner. This allows an even deeper level of understanding between two people and fosters even more intimacy as a result of the disclosures. Likewise, relationship satisfaction was found to correlate with sexual disclosures. For men, high levels of sexual self-disclosure predicted higher relationship satisfaction, though this was not found to be true for women. But, sexual satisfaction was linked to higher levels of sexual self-disclosure for both men and women. Further, those who disclose more sexually have been found to have less sexual dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rehman | first1 = U. S. | last2 = Rellini | first2 = A. H. | last3 = Fallis | first3 = E. | year = 2011 | title = The importance of sexual self-disclosure to sexual satisfaction and functioning in committed relationships | url = | journal = Journal of Sexual Medicine | volume = 8 | issue = 11| pages = 3108‚Äì3115 | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02439.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In marriage====

Self-disclosure is a method of relationship maintenance, aiming to keep partners satisfied with their relationship. Partners learn a shared communication system, and disclosures are a large part of building that system, which has been found to be very beneficial in highly satisfying relationships.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt; Significant positive relationships have been found between multiple measures of relationship satisfaction and the levels of spouses' disclosure on the Social Penetration Scale.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hendrick | first1 = S. S. | year = 1981 | title = Self-disclosure and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 40 | issue = 6| pages = 1150‚Äì1159 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.40.6.1150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, affection and support are provided to most in the most important ways through marriage. Surveys done by a variety of researchers have found that people list marriage as the ultimate form of intimacy. Spouses feel responsible, in that they need to be responsive to their partners' self-disclosures, more so than they feel obligated to respond to the disclosures of people in their other relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a study by Laurenceau and colleagues, several differences were found in the satisfaction of spouses based on their daily-diary recordings of self-disclosures in their daily interactions. The results show that the actual disclosures in the process of self-disclosure may not be the only factors that facilitate intimacy in relationships. Husbands' intimacy was most strongly predicted by self-disclosure, while perceived responsiveness to disclosure was the stronger predictor for wives' feelings of intimacy with their husbands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A different study found evidence of wives' perceptions of their husbands' self-disclosures as being a strong predictor of how long a couple will stay together. Those who think their husbands are not sharing enough are likely to break up sooner. This finding links to the idea of [[positive illusions]] in relationship studies.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt; For husbands, the actual act of self-disclosure is more indicative of their feelings of intimacy with their wives. On the other hand, wives are thought to value more the feelings of being understood and validated by their husbands' responsiveness to their disclosures, and this is the more important factor in their feelings of intimacy in their marriages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurencaeu|first=Jean-Philippe |author2=Lisa Feldman Barrett |author3=Michael J. Rovine|title=The interpersonal process model of intimacy in marriage: a daily diary and multilevel modeling approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=2|pages=314‚Äì323|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Related to these findings, those husbands who reported the highest ratings of global marital satisfaction showed the highest ratings in daily intimacy. Similarly, the wives who rated their global satisfaction highest also had higher levels of daily intimacy. Greater marital satisfaction was found among those who had the higher ratings of intimacy. Further, couples with high levels of demand-withdraw communication rated their average daily intimacy as much lower. This suggests a relationship between one's overall marital satisfaction and the amount of intimacy in a relationship, though no causation can be proven with the present research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Self-esteem has also been found to be a predictor of satisfaction, with couples exhibiting both high self-esteem and high self-disclosure levels being the most satisfied in their relationships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

More disclosures of unpleasant feelings led to less marital satisfaction in recent studies, and disclosure is affected the minute a relationship is stressed, as feelings of less attachment to a spouse promote decreased self-disclosure. Likewise, less intimacy leads to more negative disclosures between partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tolstedt|first=B.E.|author2=J.P. Stokes |title=Self-disclosure, intimacy, and the depenetration process|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|volume=1|issue=46|pages=84‚Äì90|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.1.84}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, findings by Tolstedt and Stokes (1984) suggest that the depth of self-disclosure actually increases as the intimacy of a relationship decreases. The breadth of disclosure decreases with decreasing intimacy as originally predicted, but couples actually disclose more deeply. It is speculated that these results come about because a strained relationship causes spouses to restrict their topics of communication (breadth), but that they are also more willing to discuss deeply intimate subjects: the negative ones. Thus, while they are sharing more deeply, it is mostly in a negative light. The researchers then speculated that people might actually avoid disclosing very personal facts in the most satisfying relationships because they are fearful that their positive relationships will be negatively affected.&lt;ref name="Tolstedt 1984 84‚Äì90" /&gt;

As time progresses, disclosure in marriage has been found to decrease, often around the time that spouses reach their 40's. It is suggested that at this stage partners know each other quite well and are very satisfied with what they communicate already.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Process====

People first disclose facts then emotions and disclose mostly positive information in the early stages of a relationship. Some speculate that disclosures and their respective responses from a spouse lead to intimacy between the partners, and these exchanges accumulate into global and positive evaluations of the relationship by the couple. In support, studies show that couples who report greater levels of intimacy in self-reports of their daily interactions are also those who report increased global relationship functioning in their marriages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further, the importance of disclosure in a relationship might change over time as it relates in different ways to various factors of a relationship, such as responsiveness and love, especially at the beginning of a relationship.&lt;ref name="Sprecher" /&gt;

===Effects of group size===

Disclosure also changes as group size increases. As a group gets larger, people become less willing to disclose. Research has shown that individuals are more willing to disclose in groups of two than in larger groups and are more willing to disclose in a group of three rather than four.  The actual disclosures mimic the willingness to disclose as individuals disclose more in pairs than they do in the larger groups. There are also gender differences in disclosure depending on group size. Men feel more inhibited in dyads, match the intimacy of the disclosure from their partner, and do not offer more information. Women, on the other hand, feel more inhibited in larger groups and disclose more personal information in dyads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solano|first=Cecilia|author2=Mina Dunnam |title=Two's Company: Self-Disclosure and Reciprocity in Triads Versus Dyads|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|year=1985|volume=48|issue=2|pages=183‚Äì187|doi=10.2307/3033613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In therapy==
Nearly every [[school of thought]] is in agreement that self-disclosure is a necessary element of [[therapeutic]] technique. Self-disclosure by the therapist is often thought to facilitate increased disclosure by the client, which should result in increased understanding of the problem at hand. It helps to acknowledge the therapeutic relationship as a fundamental healing source,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziv-Beiman|first=S.|title=Therapist self-disclosure as an integrative intervention|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|year=2013|volume=1|issue=23|pages=59‚Äì74|doi=10.1037/a0031783}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an alliance between client and therapist is founded on self-disclosure from both parties. In some respects it is similar to modeling appropriate social behavior. Establishing common interests between therapists and clients is useful to maintain a degree of reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sturges|first=J.W.|title=Use of therapist self-disclosure and self-involving statement|journal=The Behavior Therapist|year=2012|volume=5|issue=35|pages=90‚Äì93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing such interests is especially beneficial in therapists' relationships with children, especially teens, who need to understand that the therapist is not an authority in order to fully benefit from therapy.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Sturges, J. W. (2012). Use of therapist self-disclosure and self-involving statements. The Behavior Therapist, 35(5), 90-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies of self-disclosure in therapy, two types have been identified: immediate and non-immediate. Immediate disclosure shows positive views of the therapeutic process in which the two are engaging and communicates self-involving feelings and information about the therapist's professional background. Many see the benefits of this type of disclosure. Non-immediate disclosure, however, is the revealing of more about the therapist than his or her professional background and includes personal [[insight]]. This type is rather controversial to psychologists in the present day; many feel it may be more detrimental than it is beneficial in the long-run, but there are significant findings that contradict this claim as well.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

Further, there are two methods that therapists use to disclose: direct and indirect. Direct disclosures grant the client information about personal feelings, background, and professional issues. Indirect disclosures are those not explicitly granted, such as pictures on the therapist's desk and walls or wearing his or her wedding band.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Paine | first1 = A. L. | last2 = Veach | first2 = P. | last3 = MacFarlane | first3 = I. M. | last4 = Thomas | first4 = B. | last5 = Ahrens | first5 = M. | last6 = LeRoy | first6 = B.

===Therapists' reasons to share information===

Studies have asked therapists to report their reasons to disclose to clients. The most common reasons are: to answer a direct question from the client, to help soothe the client's feelings of loneliness, to express understanding, to lower a client's anxiety levels and make his or her feelings seem more normal, and to build rapport.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The topics discussed by therapists who self-disclose in their sessions can vary. The preferred therapeutic approach and the effectiveness of treatments are two of the most common. Many also reveal their views of raising children, stress-coping methods, items that convey respect for the client, and emotions that will validate those the client has expressed. Anecdotes about sexual attraction, dreams, and personal problems seem to be disclosed to subjects with the least frequency by therapists.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

===History===

The history of therapist disclosure has been a journey based largely on the therapists' perspectives. Early [[Psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]] theorists strongly disagreed with the incorporation of therapist self-disclosure in the client-therapist relationship. Ferenczi notably maintained his belief that self-disclosure was of the utmost importance in children's therapy for traumas in that a neutral, flat therapist would only cause the child to relive the trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Ferenczi, S., &amp; Rank, O. (1986). The development of psychoanalysis. Classics In Psychoanalysis Monograph Series, MO 4&lt;/ref&gt; [[Object relations theory|Object-relation]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s theorists want the client to be able to see how he or she is seen by another and how what she shares is viewed by another, and the best way to operationalize these factors is through a trusting relationship with a therapist who also discloses. [[Self psychology|Self-theorists]] believe much the same as object-relations theorists. [[Intersubjective psychoanalysis|Intersubjective]] and [[Relational psychodynamics|relational]] schools of thought encourage disclosure due to its ability to bring subjectivity into therapy, which they deem a necessary element to real healing. They maintain that therapeutic relationships cannot be initiated and changed without intentional disclosures from both therapist and client.&lt;ref name="Ziv"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ziv-Beiman|first=Sharon|title=Therapist self-disclosure as an integrative intervention|journal=Journal of Psychotherapy Integration|year=2013|volume=23|issue=1|pages=59‚Äì74|doi=10.1037/a0031783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary views, most agree with the inevitability of self-disclosure in therapy. [[Humanistic psychology|Humanistic]] theorists want to trigger personal growth in clients and feel that a strong relationship with a therapist is a good facilitator of such, so long as the therapist's disclosures are genuine. Seeing that weakness and struggle are common among all people, even therapists, is useful to clients in the humanistic therapy setting. In order for [[Existential therapy|existential]] psychologists to help clients, they try to disclose their own coping methods to serve as sources of inspiration to find one's own answers to questions of life. For therapists who value [[feminism]], it is important to disclose personal feelings so that their clients have total freedom to choose the correct therapist and to eliminate power fights within the therapeutic setting. The ever-popular [[Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy|cognitive-behavioral]] approach also encourages disclosure in therapy so that clients can normalize their own thoughts with someone else's, have their thoughts challenged, and reinforce positive expectations and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

Humanistic theorists have been the highest in rating self-disclosure as part of their normal therapeutic methods. Clearly, today's therapists are mostly supportive of disclosure in therapy, as the early psychoanalytic [[taboo]] of such is slowly being overridden through the recognition of many schools of thought. Most identify the benefit of self-disclosures in facilitating rewarding relationships and helping to reach therapeutic goals.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;

===Benefits===

It is useful to discuss personal matters in therapy for a variety of reasons. Certain types of disclosures are almost universally recognized as necessary in the early stages of therapy, such as an explanation of the therapeutic approach to be used and particular characteristics of the therapist.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Disclosure with another individual facilitates a closeness in that relationship and is strongly believed to lead to a deeper understanding of the self.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt; One will often see his or her disclosure in a more positive [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] if it is shared with someone else. It is thought that disclosing the details of a traumatic experience can greatly help with the organization of related thoughts, and the process of retelling is itself a method of healing. An understanding between therapist and client is achieved when the client can share his or her perceptions without feeling threatened by judgments or unwanted advice. Further, expressing emotions lessens the toll of the [[autonomic nervous system]] and has been shown in several studies to improve overall physical health in this way.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391"/&gt; A disclosing therapist invites his or her client to compare cognitive perceptions and perhaps realize his or her own distortions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The disclosure need not be verbal to be advantageous, as writing about traumas and positive experiences alike has been seen to produce less psychological and physiological distress. The [[Writing therapy|Pennebaker Writing Disclosure Paradigm]] is a method commonly used in therapy settings to facilitate writing about one's experiences. [[Exposure therapy|Exposure theory]] also offers support in that reliving and talking about a negative event should help the [[negative affect]] to be more accepted by the individual overtime through [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]].&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391"/&gt;

A study by Watkins (1990) formulated four model hypotheses for the use of self-disclosure in therapy sessions. Supported heavily is the idea of mutuality: disclosure by one leads to disclosure by the other. The modeling hypothesis suggests that the client will model the disclosures of the therapist, thereby learning expression and gaining skills in communication. Some argue for the reinforcement model, saying that the use of self-disclosure by therapists is purely to reinforce self-disclosure in their clients. Lastly, the social exchange hypothesis sees the relationship between client and therapist as an interaction that requires a guide: self-disclosure.&lt;ref name=Ziv /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, C. E. ( 1990). The effects of counselor self-disclosure: A research review. The Counseling Psychologist, 18, 477‚Äì 500. {{DOI|10.1177/0011000090183009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Clients' self-reported improvement when a therapist has used disclosure in therapy is high.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Regardless, the benefits of validating the client's thoughts through self-disclosure has been shown to be largely beneficial in the scope of therapy.

Studies have also shown the disadvantageous effects of keeping [[Secrecy|secrets]], for they serve as [[stressors]] over time. Concealing one's thoughts, actions, or ailments does not allow a therapist to examine and work through the client's problem. Unwanted, recurrent thoughts, feelings of anxiousness and [[Depression (mood)|depression]], sleeping problems, and many other physiological, psychological, and physical issues have been seen as the results of withholding important information from others.&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391"/&gt;

The treatment of clients with [[adjustment disorders]], [[anxiety disorders]], [[mood disorders]], and [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] have been thought to use self-disclosure techniques the most. Therapy sessions for [[personality disorders]], [[Behavioral disorder|behavior disorders]], [[impulse control disorders]], and [[psychotic disorders]] seem to use therapist self-disclosure far less often.&lt;ref name=Ziv /&gt;

===Effects on the client's view of the therapist===

Therapists who self-disclose, especially information that validates or reflects the information disclosed by the client, have been rated in studies consistently as demonstrating more warmth and being more personable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A study using participants who were to imagine themselves in hypothetical counseling situations found that therapists who responded to "What would you do if you were me?" when asked by the client, were viewed as more socially attractive, more expert, and more trustworthy. Their likability was increased by their willingness to disclose to their clients. The three dimensions mentioned have been said to be of utmost importance when determining one's likability.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, these therapists may also been seen as less professional for these disclosures. Additionally, a therapist who discloses too frequently risks losing focus in the session, talking too much about himself or herself and not allowing the client to actually harvest the benefits of the disclosures in the session through client-focused reflection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ziv /&gt; Much research has found that successful therapy treatments are enhanced when the client has a largely favorable view of the therapist.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Environmental contributions to client disclosures===

The atmosphere in which the therapy takes place is crucial too. Research shows that "soft" architecture and decor in a room promotes disclosure from clients. This is achieved with rugs, framed photos, and mellow lighting. It is thought that this environment more closely imitates the setting in which friends would share feelings, and so the same might be facilitated between counselor and client. Further, a room should not be too crowded nor too small in order to foster good disclosures from the client&lt;ref name="Ignatius 2007 362‚Äì391" /&gt;

===Effectiveness===
The efficacy of self-disclosure is widely debated by researchers, and findings have yielded a variety of results, both positive and negative. A typical method of researching such ideas involves [[Self-report study|self-reports]] of both therapists and clients. The evaluations of therapists on the positive effects of their own disclosures is far less positive than that of clients' self-reports. Clients are especially likely to assert that the disclosures of their therapists help in their recovery if the disclosures are perceived as more intimate in content.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Clients report that disclosures are helpful when they encourage a positive relationship with the therapist, build trust in their therapists' abilities and general person, create a feeling of being better-understood, and make the therapist seem more human. Much of these results, however, are linked to how skilled the therapist is in disclosing.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Risks===

Any information revealed that could reverse the effects of therapy or switch the roles of therapist and client is thought to be the most detrimental. Therapists must choose wisely in what they disclose and when. A client who is suffering greatly or facing a horrific crisis is not likely to benefit much from therapist self-disclosures. If a client at any point feels he or she, should be acting as a source of support to the therapist, disclosure is only hindering the healing process. Further, clients might become overwhelmed if their initial ideas of therapy do not include any degree of self-disclosure from their counselor, and this will not lead to successful therapy sessions either. It is also a risk to reveal too much about a therapist because the client may begin to see the healer as flawed and untrustworthy. Clients should not feel like they are in competition for time to speak and express themselves during therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite contradictory findings, self-disclosure is still used frequently in therapy and is often recommended. The [[American Psychological Association]] supports the technique, calling it "promising and probably effective".&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt; Therapists are advised, however, to use self-disclosure with a mild frequency, to disclose more immediate-disclosure information, to keep intimacy at a minimum, and to keep the focus on the client promptly after disclosure to ensure optimum effectiveness in therapy sessions.&lt;ref name="Ziv" /&gt; Therapist self-disclosure in a counseling setting is ethical so long as the client is not harmed or exploited.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Self-involving statements===

Therapists who use self-involving statements are likely to facilitate valuable self-disclosures from their clients. Using [[I-statements|"I" statements]], a therapist emits a certain level of care not otherwise felt by many clients, and they are likely to benefit from this feeling of being cared for. In cases of a therapist needing to provide feedback, self-involving statements are nearly inevitable, for he or she must state a true opinion of what the client has disclosed. These sorts of "I" statements, when used correctly and professionally, are usually seen as especially validating by clients. Largely, the use of self-involving statements by therapists is seen as a way of making the interaction more authentic for the client, and such exchanges can have a great impact on the success of the treatment at hand.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Marital therapy ===
Couples-therapy is often centered on creating more intimacy in a relationship. Spouses are encouraged, or even required, to disclose unexpressed emotions and feelings to their partners. The partners' responses are practiced to be nonjudgmental and accepting. Therapists utilize techniques like rehearsal and the teaching of listening skills. Some fear that this is of little long-term help to the couple because in their real lives, there is no mediator or guiding therapist's hand when one is disclosing to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laurenceau|first=Jean-Philippe |author2=Lise Feldman Barret |author3=Michael J. Rovine|title=The interpersonal process model of intimacy in marriage: a daily-diary and multilevel modeling approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2005|volume=19|issue=2|pages=314‚Äì323|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.19.2.314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that self-disclosure is related to husband's ratings of marital satisfaction, teaching proper ways for a couple to disclose to one another might be a very beneficial skill therapists can use both for prevention and treatment in therapy sessions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==During childhood==
While striving to become more like adults, looking for greater independence, and learning to become more self-reliant, children are also trying to facilitate relationships of equality with their parents. Goals like these, as reported by young people fairly universally, can affect how they disclose to their parents to a large degree.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Children's disclosures with their parents has been studied by many, especially recently, after the discoveries of disclosures' positive relationships with children's adjustment levels and psychological and physical health. Some go so far as to use the rate of self-disclosure between parents and children as a dominant measure of the strength of their relationship and its health.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hunter | first1 = S. B. | last2 = Barber | first2 = B. K. | last3 = Olsen | first3 = J. A. | last4 = McNeely | first4 = C. A. | last5 = Bose | first5 = K. | year = 2011 | title = Adolescents' self-disclosure to parents across cultures: Who discloses and why | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescent Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 447‚Äì478 | doi = 10.1177/0743558411402334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purpose of disclosure===

In [[adolescents]]' relationships with their parents, self-disclosure is thought to serve three key functions: 
#  [[Intimacy]] is promoted. When information is withheld, distance is created and closeness is nearly impossible to facilitate.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; 
#  [[Autonomy]] is regulated. Teens pick and choose what to tell their parents, thus limiting their control over the teens' daily activities.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
#  [[Individuation]] is heightened. Adolescents' unique preferences and interests are expressed. If these vary from their parents', they establish an identity of their own.&lt;ref name="tokic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tokic|first=Ana|author2=Ninoslava Pecnik |title=Parental behaviors related to adolescents' self-disclosure: adolescents' views|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=2010|volume=2|issue=28|pages=201‚Äì220|doi=10.1177/0265407510382320}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Children still attempt to maintain a certain amount of control over their parents' knowledge of their lives by monitoring how and when to disclose to them. Thus, they moderate their parents' potential reactions. Because of this, it is important for parents to be aware of how they react to their children's disclosures, for these reactions will be used as judgment calls for the children's' future sharing.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Reasons for===

Often, the reason for disclosing given by children in studies is  based on the parent's expectations: "I've learned that [Mom or Dad] wants to have this information." This is adaptive, in that the child has learned what his or her parents want to know. Other times a reason is that the children do not want their parents to worry about them, and this is called parent-centered disclosures. Disclosing in order to make oneself feel better or to ensure protection from parents is considered to be another reason for youth to disclose, and it is called self-oriented disclosure. On a more manipulative level, some adolescents report telling their parents things based solely on gaining an advantage of some sort, whether this is the right to reveal less or the fact that being more open tends to result in more adolescent privileges. Sometimes children qualify their disclosures by merely stating that they only disclose what they feel they want to their parents. Thus, some information is kept secret. This is dubbed selective self-disclosure. In sum, adolescents feel different pulls that make them self-disclose to their parents that can be based on the parents' needs and the children's needs. There has not been a distinct pattern found to predict which reasons will be utilized to explain disclosures by different children. For this reason it is widely believed that the reason for disclosure is largely situation- and context- dependent.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Benefits===

The self-disclosure of children to their parents is the dominant source of information for parents to gain knowledge about their children and their daily lives. Parental knowledge of their children's whereabouts and daily lives has been linked to several positive outcomes. The more parents know about their kids, the lower the rate of behavior problems among children, and the higher the children's [[well-being]]. Adolescents who disclose have been found to have lower rates of [[substance abuse]], lower rates of risky sexual behaviors, lower anxiety levels, and lower rates of depression.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Urry | first1 = S. A. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = L. J. | last3 = Padilla-Walker | first3 = L. M. | year = 2011 | title = Mother knows best: Psychological control, child disclosure, and maternal knowledge in emerging adulthood | url = | journal = Journal of Family Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 157‚Äì173 | doi = 10.5172/jfs.2011.17.2.157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Additionally, those who are well-adjusted, meaning they exhibit the qualities discussed above, generally want and enjoy parental involvement and are likely to disclose more.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; In contrast, keeping secrets from one's parents has been linked to more [[physical illness]], poor behavior, and depression in all cultural groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many theorize that in at least one significant relationship one should feel able to disclose nearly completely in order for a healthy personality to develop.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; While parental behavioral control was once thought to provide the greatest benefits to children in limiting their activities and serving as a source of forced protection, more recent research strongly suggests that disclosures to parents that provide the parents with information about daily activities actually shows the most promise in fostering positive development through childhood and adolescence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Development of reciprocity===

Reciprocity in children's self-disclosures is often examined in children's friendships. It has been shown that children's understanding of friendship involves sharing secrets with another person. This mutual exchange of sharing secrets could be the norm of reciprocity, in which individuals disclose because it is a social norm. This [[norm of reciprocity]] is shown to begin occurring for children in sixth grade. Sixth graders are able to understand the norm of reciprocity because they realize that relationships require both partners to cooperate and to mutually exchange secrets. They realize this because they possess the cognitive ability to take another person's perspective into account and are able to understand a third person's views which allows them to view friendships as an ongoing systematic relationship.&lt;ref name = "Rotenberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotenberg|first=Ken|author2=Nancy Chase |title=Development of the reciprocity of self-disclosure.|journal=The Journal of Genetic Psychology|year=1992|volume=153|issue=1|pages=75‚Äì86|doi=10.1080/00221325.1992.10753703}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children in sixth grade are also shown to understand equivalent reciprocity. Equivalent reciprocity requires matching the level of intimacy a partner discloses, therefore, a high-intimacy disclosure would be matched with an equally revealing disclosure while a low-intimacy disclosure would be matched with little information revealed. Another type of reciprocity is covariant reciprocity, in which disclosures are more intimate if a partner communicates a high-intimacy disclosure instead of a low-intimacy disclosure. This differs from equivalent reciprocity, which matches the level of intimacy, while covariant reciprocity only focuses on whether someone disclosed something personal or not. Covariant reciprocity is shown to begin in fourth grade.&lt;ref name="Rotenberg" /&gt;

It has also been shown that girls across all ages disclose more intimate information than boys, and that the number of disclosures a child reveals increases with age.&lt;ref name="Rotenberg" /&gt;

===Influencing factors===
Early studies note two distinct factors that contribute to how much children self-disclose to their parents. The first is intraindividual factors, which are those that are on the child's mind and cause him or her to need social input. Biological development, cultural and social pressures, and individual [[maturity (psychological)|maturity]] determine these issues, and, thus, a child's age, personality, and background also contribute to his or her level and need of self-disclose in a relationship with a parent.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

The second set of factors is called contextual factors, which include the opportunities and situations that the individual has to disclose as created by the [[Sociocultural perspective|sociocultural]] environment. These are most directly related, then, to the target of the disclosure; these targets are the parents.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

Also, gender contributes: girls are noted for usually disclosing their problems, mostly to their mothers, while boys reveal more about bad grades, behavioral conflicts, and other issues to both parents.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

Certain people are more likely to get others to disclose. These are called high openers. Even people known to disclose very little are likely to disclose more to high openers. Thus, if parents are characterized as good listeners, trustworthy, accepting, relaxed, and sympathetic, as are high openers, then they will likely elicit more disclosure from their children. Adolescents who view their parents like this are also said to see them as less controlling and less likely to react negatively to their disclosures. Parental responsiveness has been said to be the dominant factor of influence on adolescents' rates of self-disclosure; warmth and affection facilitate more disclosures.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Parental psychological control has also been linked to increased self-disclosure of personal issues and peer issues among youth. While this sort of control is not often thought of in a positive light, some hypothesize that these kids are likely just feeling coerced to disclose subtly and without being harmed. Much of what children choose to reveal to their parents is based on previous disclosures and their parents' reactions to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Feelings about the parent-child relationship during one's upbringing have also be found to correlate with the child's disclosures to the parents. A child with a positive memory of his or her relationship with a parent during the past years is a predictor of a higher level of self-disclosure. In fact, the view of the parent-child relationship in the past is a stronger predictor than that of the child's view of the current parent-child relationship. The relationship with the mother, in particular, is extremely predictive of disclosures from adolescents. Such findings suggest to parents that fostering [[secure attachment]] early in their children will better set the stage for disclosures in the later years, and their children may then reap the benefits of such a relationship.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Adolescents are able to determine their own amount of parental authority over certain issues by how much or how little they choose to disclose to their parents.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Surveys revealed that they are least likely to share information that involves their personal feelings and activities. They actively resist disclosing this to their parents because they do not see the issues as being harmful, or they feel their parents will not listen to them, or because the matters are very private to them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The way adolescents perceive their parents' authority as legitimate largely impacts how much they feel obligated to disclose to them. The more authority the children believe their parents rightly possess, the more [[obligation]] they perceive to share their lives accordingly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Parents who attempt a large degree of psychological control over their children are unlikely to be disclosed to as frequently, which only makes logical sense given the fact that most children are searching for a sense of autonomy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The adolescents have been found to feel the most obligation to tell their parents about such activities as drinking and smoking but less need to disclose information about personal issues. Not surprising either, less obligation is felt as age increases.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt; Contrary to popular belief though, most adolescents in the US do not consider themselves to be adults between the ages of 18 and 27, and their parents feel the same way. The age at which children feel they no longer are obligated to disclose to their parents has increased over time, and the same trend is predicted over the next few decades.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Often, the motivation to disclose negative behaviors is purely because the children fear that they will not get away with it or feel obligated to share. Adolescents also want to disclose more if they feel that the activities in question are out of their own jurisdiction. Jurisdiction is measured, in the adolescents' minds, as how short-term and close the activities are. Short-term, close activities are judged as ones to be handled without disclosure to parents, while activities that will take longer or require the adolescent to be farther from home are thought of as being issues to discuss with parents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Inhibitors===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make disclosures unlikely:&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Mood: Nervous, angry, or unhappy parents make children less likely to disclose&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Preoccupied: Parents who do not seem accessible to their children do not receive good disclosures&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reluctance: When parents seem unwilling to talk about problems or consistently avoid certain topics of conversation&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Questioning: Adolescents are bothered by persistent questions that their parents ask of them&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Respect: Children do not disclose as much if they feel their parents are not taking them seriously&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Nagging: When parents seem to hag on unimportant matters, children become frustrated&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Previous disapproval: Adolescents are not likely to disclose if their parents have previously expressed disapproval of a matter they wish to discuss&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Factors that discourage future disclosures===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make the child less willing to disclose to that parent in the future:
*Distraction: If parents seem inattentive, the child is not likely to try to disclose in the future&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Respect: Parents who make jokes about disclosures or tease their children discourage future discussions&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Lack of trust: Children are not likely to disclose again when parents have shown doubt about their previous disclosures or checked the information that had been revealed&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Interrupting: Parents who interrupt their children do not encourage future disclosure&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Lack of relatability: Children will not disclose again if they feel their parents did not try to understand their position in previous disclosures&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Lack of receptivity: Parents who seem not to care about the child's thoughts on matters and who will not listen to arguments discourage future disclosure&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Confidentiality: Children feel less inclined to disclose in the future if their parents do not keep their disclosures confidential&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Emotion: Parents who have angry outbursts do not encourage further disclosures from their children&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Consequences: Disclosures that resulted in punishment serve has discouragement for future disclosures. Additionally, long lectures from parents are not viewed as favorable&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Disappointment: When disclosure has made a parent disappointed or sad in his or her child, the child feels less inclined to disclose again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Silence: Parents who respond to a disclosure with the [[silent treatment]] are unlikely to facilitate later disclosures&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Withholding permission: If earlier disclosure resulted in parents withholding permissions for children to participate in their desired activities, the children often do not disclose such information again later&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Facilitators===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make disclosures likely:
*Mood: Positive moods (happy and relaxed) in parents make adolescents likely to begin to disclose&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Accessibility: When parents seem ready and able to chat without doing other things, children want to disclose to them&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Opportunities: Parents who make time for the child, initiate conversations, and prompt disclosures (perhaps with humor) usually facilitate disclosures from their children&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reciprocal disclosure: Children are encouraged if their parents choose to reveal things about themselves&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Questions: Open-ended questions give adolescents motivation to disclose&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Attention to child's mood: When parents recognize the affective state of a child, the child feels cared for and is likely to be open to discussing the causes of that mood&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Unconditional disclosure: Children feel encouraged to disclose when parents make a point of telling the child to reveal himself or herself no matter what&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Pace: Letting children choose how and how fast they disclose makes them more likely to reveal things to their parents&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

===Factors that encourage future disclosures===
Certain events and characteristics of the parent-child relationship make the child more likely to disclose to that parent in the future:
*Support: Previous disclosures that have made the child feel emotionally supported positively affect whether or not he or she will disclose to a parent again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Humor: Parents who can appreciate humor in disclosure, where appropriate, encourage the child to disclose again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reciprocity: Parental disclosure makes a child more likely to disclose to that parent again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Understanding/empathy: A parent who makes an obvious attempt to understand the child's position makes the child more willing to share in the future.&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Attention: Children will likely disclose again when they believe their parents are giving them their full attention without interruption&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Appreciations: Parents who express to their adolescents that they value their disclosures encourage such to happen again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Respect: Children want to disclose again if they feel their parents take them seriously&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Confidence in the child: Parents who express their trust in the child's ability to handle his or her problems will likely be disclosed to in the future&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Trustworthiness: Adolescents will want to reveal information to their parents again if they trust that the disclosure will be confidential&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Advice: If parents offer good advice and help for a youth's problems, he or she is prompted to discuss things with the parent later on&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Reactions: Parents will often be told information from their children again if they keep their reactions to disclosures calm&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Discussion: Children prefer to talk about their issues, so if adults are willing, children will likely open up to them often&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Receptivity: Adults who consider arguments from the child and "hear him or her out" encourage these children to reveal their thoughts again&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;
*Results: If permissions for adolescents' wishes have been granted after disclosing in the past, the child is more likely to disclose in the future&lt;ref name="tokic" /&gt;

==On the Internet==

There are four major differences between online communication and face to face communication. The first is that [[Internet]] users can remain anonymous. The user can choose what personal information (if any) they share with other users. Even if the user decides to use their own name, if communicating with people in others cities or countries they are still relatively anonymous. The second is that physical distance does not limit interaction on the Internet the way it does in real life. The Internet gives the ability to interact with people all over the world and the chance to meet people who have similar interests that one may not have met in their offline life.  Visual cues, including those pertaining to physical attractiveness, are also not always present on the Internet. These factors have been shown to influence initial attraction and relationship formation. Finally, Internet users have time to formulate conversations which is not allotted in face to face conversation. This gives a user more control in the conversation because they do not have to give an immediate response.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Katelyn Y. A.|last1=McKenna|first2=John A.|last2=Bargh|title=Plan 9 From Cyberspace: The Implications of the Internet for Personality and Social Psychology|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2000|volume=4|issue=1|pages=57‚Äì75|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0401_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of online interaction affecting disclosure===

====Anonymity====

[[Anonymity]] can allow individuals to take greater risks and discuss how they truly feel with others. A person might take these risks because they are more aware of their private self. Private self-awareness is when a person becomes more aware of personal features of the self. This is in contrast to public self-awareness in which a person realizes that they can be judged by others. This type of awareness can lead to evaluation apprehension, where a person fears receiving a negative evaluation from their peers. Public self-awareness is also associated with conforming to group norms even if they go against personal beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crisp|first1=R.J.|last2=Turner|first2=R.N.|title=Essential Social Psychology|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|isbn=1849203865|pages=2‚Äì7}}&lt;/ref&gt; With that said, the absence of visual cues from a partner in Internet discussion can activate a person's private self which encourages self-disclosure. This is because the discloser is not worried about being judged publicly and is able to express their own private thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joinson|first=Adam|title=Self-disclosure in computer-mediated communication: The role of self-awareness and visual anonymity.|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=31|issue=2|pages=177‚Äì192|doi=10.1002/ejsp.36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymity also aids in identity construction. A person can change their gender and the way they relate to others due to anonymity. This can increase life satisfaction because those who can identify with multiple roles are shown to be more satisfied. Since the Internet can allow someone to adopt these roles, that close others may not accept in the real world, it can increase their self-worth and acceptance.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;
 
The anonymity that comes with Internet communication also makes it easier to reveal the "[[true self]]". The "true self", as described by McKenna and her colleagues includes the traits a person possesses but is unable to share freely with others. What they do share is the "actual self" which includes traits they do possess and are able to be shown in social settings. The actual self can be easier to present in face to face conversations because a person's true self may not fit societal norms. Disclosing one's "true self" has been shown to create empathetic bonds and aid in forming close relationships.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bargh|first1=John A.|last2=McKenna|first2=Katelyn Y.A.|last3=Fitzsimons|first3=Grainne M.|title=Can You See the Real Me? Activation and Expression of the "True Self" on the Internet|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2002|volume=58|issue=1|pages=33‚Äì48|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anonymity can also help stigmatized groups reveal their "true selves" and allow them to come together to discuss aspects of the self that cannot be discussed in one's social circle. This can help them in life because it allows them to form a group of similar others and the opportunity to receive emotional support. It has also been found that those who join these groups and disclose their identity were more likely to share this aspect of the self with their close family and friends. Sharing these long kept secrets has also shown to significantly reduce health symptoms over a length of time.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

There are some negative consequences to being anonymous on the Internet. [[Deindividuation]], where self-awareness is blocked by environmental conditions, can occur and be problematic. Some consequences of deindividuation include the reduced ability to control one's behavior and engage in rational, long-term planning, and the tendency to react immediately and emotionally. A person who is lacking this self-awareness is also less likely to care about other's opinions of his or her behavior. This all can lead to increased hostility towards others and the formation of anonymous hate groups.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

There can also be some negative consequences to forming multiple selves. If these identities are not integrated it can lead to an incomplete sense of self. They could also be brought into the real world and lead to delusional and unrealistic behavior.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;
 
One downside to all of the connections that can be formed online regards the effect called the "illusion of large numbers." This effect means that people overestimate how many people share the same opinion as them. This can be especially harmful if someone holds negative views of a particular group because they may not realize that their views are very different from the mainstream.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

====Lack of visual cues and physical attractiveness====

Physical attractiveness plays an important role in determining if two people will begin a relationship. In face to face conversation, if initial attraction is not present, the relationship is less likely to form. This, however, does not play a role in Internet communication. Relationships online must form based on things such as similarities, values, interests or an engaging conversation style. Since these relationships form at a deeper level they may be more durable and more important to the individual. Not being seen also assists in presenting ideal qualities (attributes an individual would ideally like to possess)  to other users because there is no information to contradict what they say, the way there is in face to face conversation. This can help a person make these ideal qualities a [[social reality]] because when someone confirms these traits the individual can make them a part of their self-concept.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

An individual is also liked more on the Internet than in face to face conversation. Even if partners think they are communicating with two different people they still like the person from the Internet more than the face to face interaction, even though they were the same person. This greater liking also continues after the initial interaction on the Internet when the pair meets face to face. This greater liking may occur because of the lack of physical information. Physical attractiveness plays an important role in impression formation and once these views are formed they are not likely to be changed even when presented with new information. Since the people communicating online cannot rely on attractiveness these factors may not play a role when they eventually meet face to face. An increase in disclosures can also foster this liking because intimate disclosure is associated with increased intimacy.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt; Online disclosures are generally seen as more intimate than face to face disclosures. Since there is a lack of nonverbal cues in Internet communication, many people form a biased perception of their communication partner. The minimal cues that are available in computer based communication are often over interpreted and the person will attach greater value to them. For example, if there seems to be a similarity between the two communicating, an individual may intensify this perception and idealize their partner. This all then increases the perceived intimacy of the discloser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jiang|first1=L.C.|last2=Bazarova|first2=N.N.|last3=Hancock|first3=J.T.|title=From Perception to Behavior: Disclosure Reciprocity and the Intensification of Intimacy in Computer-Mediated Communication|journal=Communication Research|year=2013|volume=40|issue=1|pages=125‚Äì143|doi=10.1177/0093650211405313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical distance and familiarity====

People are more likely to form relationships with those who are in close physical proximity of them. Individuals are also more likely to begin an interaction with someone who is seen on a regular basis, showing that familiarity also influences interactions. Communicating on the Internet can allow individuals to become familiar with those who frequent the pages they converse on by recognizing usernames and pages. Regardless of how far away these individuals may be from each other, they are all in one confined space on the Internet which can give the feeling of being in the same place. The Internet also brings people together that may not have met because of physical distance. They can also go to specific websites where people share the same interests so they enter conversations knowing they already have similarities. This can contribute to why Internet relationships form so quickly. These online users do not have to go through the traditional stages that face to face interactions require in order to find similar interests. These face to face interactions usually take longer to find common ground but online users are able to dive right into conversations.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

====Pace and control of conversation====

Internet communication differs significantly from face-to-face conversation in the timing and pacing of a conversation. For example, both users do not need to be online at the same time to have a conversation. E-mail, for example, allows individuals to send messages and wait for a reply that may not come for hours or even days. This can allow many people to stay in touch, even if they are in different time zones, which significantly broadens the range of communication.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

This communication also allows an individual to take their time when speaking with someone. They do not have to have an immediate response that face-to-face conversation requires. This allows them to carefully select and edit their messages and gives them more control over their side of the conversation that they would not have outside of the Internet. There are also no interruptions in online communication that occur in face-to-face conversation. A person is able to "hold the floor" and say as little or as much as they would like in these communications, allowing them to fully form their point.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

This control helps users to take greater risks with their self-disclosures online. These people also begin to incorporate their Internet lives with their non-Internet lives and engage in a presence‚Äìcontrol exchange. In this exchange, Internet users start their relationships with relatively high control and gradually trade that for physical closeness as their comfort levels and knowledge of the other person increases. This seems to be the Internet version of [[social penetration theory]], where individuals have a mutual exchange of self-disclosures. As the relationship develops in face-to-face communication the individuals' disclosures gradually become more revealing and cover a wide range of topics. This equivalent on the Internet includes the partners exchanging control of the conversation for physical closeness. The stages this occurs in could include moving from messaging online, to telephone conversations and eventually face-to-face communication.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

===Individual differences===

====Self-esteem====

The use of social media for self-disclosure has shown to be very helpful for those with low [[self-esteem]]. People with low self-esteem are more socially anxious and shy which can make it difficult to form close relationships with others. This can harm both their physical and mental health because feeling connected to others is considered a fundamental human motivation.  Individuals with low self-esteem have difficulty disclosing to others because they are very focused on not revealing their flaws and fear criticism and disapproval from others. Disclosing less, therefore, protects them from the possibility of rejection or being ignored. 
In light of these fears, social media can provide a safe environment for people with low self-esteem to disclose personal information because they cannot see their partner's reactions which can help them to more freely express themselves.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forest|first1=Amanda L.|last2=Wood|first2=Joanne V.|title=When Social Networking is Not Working: Individuals with Low Self-Esteem Recognize but do not Reap the Benefits of Self-Disclosure on Facebook|journal=Psychological Science|year=2012|volume=23|issue=3|pages=298‚Äì302|doi=10.1177/0956797611429709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many with low self-esteem do view social media as a safe outlet for disclosure, many do not receive positive feedback for their disclosures. People with low self-esteem tend to post more negative thoughts on social media which has been shown to make them less liked by readers. Negative posts are also more likely to be ignored by readers in hopes that the discloser will stop and begin to post more positively. When someone who frequently shares negative thoughts posts something positive they do receive more positive feedback from readers. In contrast, someone with high self-esteem is more liked by readers and tends to post more positively. If they do post something negative they tend to get more responses than those with low self-esteem do.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

====Loneliness====

Social media can also help those who are [[loneliness|lonely]]. Many social networking sites give access to profiles, pictures and the ability to comment and message others which helps people to feel less lonely. It also aids them in gaining social capital like emotional satisfaction and access to information. These sites can facilitate disclosure because they make it easier to access others who can provide social support for someone to disclose personal information. Social support is extremely important in disclosure as it makes the discloser feel validated and cared for. Social support is also positively related to well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=K.|last2=Noh|first2=M.|last3=Koo|first3=D.|title=Lonely people are no longer lonely on social networking sites: The mediating role of self-disclosure and social support.|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|year=2013|volume=16|issue=6|pages=413‚Äì418|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0553}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that having this social support and forming close relationships online decreases loneliness overtime.&lt;ref name= "McKennaGreenGleason2002"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Katelyn Y. A.|last1=McKenna|first2=Amie S.|last2=Green|first3=Marci E.J.|last3=Gleason|title=Relationship Formation on the Internet: What's the Big Attraction?|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2002|volume=58|pages=9‚Äì31|doi=10.1111/1540-4560.00246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research does show that spending too  much time on the Internet and forming these close relationships could take away time from existing non-Internet relationships. Neglecting these relationships could make a person lonelier in the long run because they could lose these face to face relationships.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt;

However, other research shows that there are certain personality traits that lead to increased loneliness which then leads to increased use of the Internet. In particular, extroversion and neuroticism have been linked to loneliness. An extrovert is someone who is outgoing, enjoys the company of others, requires stimulation, and is spontaneous, while an introvert prefers his or her own company, is quiet, and prefers quiet, small gatherings. Introverts can often be seen as distant and unfriendly because of this behavior which may explain some of their loneliness. A neurotic person is extremely anxious, emotional and reacts in a disproportional way to many situations. Someone high in neuroticism generally has a negative attitude which may push people away and prevent them from forming close relationships which may lead to their loneliness.  Both of these groups (introverts and neurotics) have been shown to have increased Internet use and in particular increased use of social service sites (i.e. chatrooms, newsrooms, etc.). This may show that those who are already lonely are more attracted to the Internet as a means of social networking and not that the Internet increases loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|author2=E. Ben-Artzi |title=Loneliness and Internet use|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2003|volume=19|pages=71‚Äì80|doi=10.1016/s0747-5632(02)00014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introverts and neurotic individuals have also been shown to feel more comfortable revealing their "true-self" online than in face-to-face conversation and revealing the "real you" has been shown to help the discloser to form close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Amichai-Hamburger|first=Yair|author2=Galit Wainapel |author3=Shaul Fox |title="On the Internet No One Knows I'm an Introvert":Extroversion, Neuroticism, and Internet Interaction|journal=Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2002|volume=5|issue=2|pages=125‚Äì128|doi=10.1089/109493102753770507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social anxiety====

It can be very difficult for those with [[social anxiety]] to engage in face to face communication. These people can become anxious when meeting someone for the first time, speaking with someone attractive, or participating in group activities. This can limit their in-person interactions and deny them their basic needs of intimacy and belonging. With the absence of many of these worries in Internet communication, many with social anxieties use it to form social connections. It has been shown that individuals with social anxiety are more likely to use the Internet to form close relationships. These relationships are also shown to be stronger online relationships as opposed to weaker relationships (i.e. "acquaintances").&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt; Forming these relationships can also help a socially anxious person express their true-self and form their social identity. This identity often involves the groups a person is a part of because belonging to a group frequently becomes a part of one's self-concept.  Someone with social anxiety would be denied this because of their fear of face-to-face interaction. Therefore, disclosing with others online gives a socially anxious person access to a wide variety of people with which they can form relationships and belong to a group.&lt;ref name="McKennaGreenGleason2002" /&gt;

Socially anxious people are also shown to become less anxious over time if they have formed close online relationships. They have also been shown to broaden their social circles in the "real world" when they have had this time to form online relationships.&lt;ref name="McKennaGreenGleason2002" /&gt; One possibility for this occurrence may be that these online relationships can give the anxious individuals confidence in forming relationships outside of the Internet. Being able to practice communications online can show them they are capable of communicating and can lessen their anxieties in face to face communication.&lt;ref name="McKennaBargh2000" /&gt; They are also very likely to bring their online relationships into their offline lives in order to make them a "social reality" by sharing these relationships with family and friends in the real world.&lt;ref name="McKennaGreenGleason2002" /&gt;

===Online support groups===

Online support groups are another place where people from all over can come together to disclose common struggles. They provide an environment of mutual disclosure and support. People are more likely to use these forums to discuss personal struggles and disclose emotions and thoughts pertaining to these struggles than normal discussion forums. There is also a higher degree of reciprocity in online support groups than in normal discussion forums and reciprocity has been shown to help people feel valued after disclosing. Men and women are also equally likely to use these forums for disclosing personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barak|first1=A.|last2=Gluck-Ofri|first2=O.|title=Degree and Reciprocity of Self Disclosure in Online Forums|journal=Cyberpsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2007|volume=10|issue=3|doi=10.1089/cpb.2006.9938|pages=407‚Äì417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dangers===

While there are many benefits to engaging in self-disclosure online there are also some dangers. There is a relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and problematic behavior. Internet abuse can be defined as, "patterns of using the Internet that result in disturbances in a person's life but does not imply a specific disease process or addictive behavior."  When a person is high for Internet abuse and high for self-disclosure it can lead to dangerous behaviors like sending personal information (addresses, home phone number etc.) and photos to online acquaintances.  High ratings for Internet abuse and self-disclosure also positively influence online communication with all types of online relationships. These relationship types include long-distance relationships, in which people have met face to face and continue the relationship by communicating online; purely virtual relationships, where people meet online and stay in touch only by using the Internet; and migratory mixed-mode, where the relationship begins online and then proceeds to face to face interaction. The relationship between Internet abuse, self-disclosure and dangerous behaviors could pose an even bigger problem with the high number of communications this group has with others, particularly those they have only communicated with online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blau|first=Ina|title=Application Use, Online Relationship Types, Self-Disclosure, and Internet Abuse Among Children and Youth: Implications for Education and Internet Safety Programs|journal=Educational Computing Research|year=2011|volume=45|issue=1|pages=95‚Äì116|doi=10.2190/EC.45.1.e}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The Internet, while providing most with a source of entertainment, knowledge, and social realms, is actually a large threat to children due to the ways in which they self-disclose. Their privacy is often more at risk than is an adults because of their openness to sites. Given that they are still developing, researchers say that they are in the "Cued Processors" group between the ages of eight and eleven. At this time, many children are using the Internet and are doing so alone, without the guidance and overseeing of an adult/guardian. Thus, they must use their own judgments to decide how much information to share on the various sites they visit.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As  "Cued Processors", however, they are only able to think logically about concrete events; the notion of their disclosures online being used against them is far in the abstract world. They will likely not think of any sort of consequences that could result from their disclosures, and this is just what online marketers and predators alike expect and are looking for. Combined with [[behavioral profiling]] tracking programs, online advertisers and predators can build a pretty clear image of the child and what he or she likes to do, where he or she lives, his or her phone number, his or her school district, and other sources of identifying information that they use to prompt the child to disclose without his or her really knowing. A common strategy is the use of brand characters in online games who "ask" for the information; children are especially likely to give out very personal information in this sort of setting. The children's vulnerability online is a product of their cognitive limitations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lwin | first1 = M. O. | last2 = Miyazaki | first2 = A. D. | last3 = Stanaland | first3 = A. S. | last4 = Lee | first4 = E. | year = 2012 | title = Online usage motive and information disclosure for preteen children | url = | journal = Young Consumers | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 345‚Äì356 | doi = 10.1108/17473611211282590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Uses and gratifications theory]]  is often used to attempt to explain such things as motivation on the Internet. Studies have found that, if applied to the use of the Internet by children and their likelihood to disclose personal information, one can find significant [[correlations]] with various types of motivation. Children who use the Internet primarily as a source of information are less likely to give out personal information. Some theorize that these children are simply made to be more aware of the dangers of Internet disclosures and are more cautious because of this. But, children who mention social contact on the Internet as their first-order use are more often the ones who submit to the attempts of online marketers and predators who seek their personal contact information and behavioral preferences. These children have goals of social acceptance in mind, and it seems to them that acceptance can be easily gained from sharing and communicating with friends and strangers alike. Socializing motives reduce privacy concerns, and children will disclose nearly anything online in order to be seen and responded to socially. It was also discovered that a simple incentive is usually enough to elicit personal information from a child.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Parents' knowledge of their children's Internet use is rapidly decreasing. Children are withholding more and more from their parents, including how much information they are sharing over the Internet. Parent-child self-disclosure about this topic needs to be increased if interventions are to help keep children safer online. Notably, there are many parents who have even admitted to allowing their children to lie about their ages on [[social media]] sites in order to gain access to them. Parents, thus, are encouraged to remain open to discussing such things with their children, to use better judgment themselves when making decisions about their children's Internet usage, and to provide them with education about how privacy on the Internet is a risky notion.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Today, many regulations are being proposed and implemented that will hopefully help protect children's personal information on the Internet. However, these will not be enough to guarantee safe exchanges of self-disclosure, so adults still must be open to discussion with their children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==In education==

Self-disclosure is an important matter to consider in the realm of education. The varying ways that it can impact social relations adds a new and important dynamic to the classroom. There are different results and experiences that students and teachers see from the implementation of self-disclosure in the classroom. The relationships that will be addressed through the lens of self-disclosure include the student to teacher relationship, the student to student relationship and how cultural relations impacts the situation as a whole.

===Student to teacher relations===

The tone of the classroom is set by the attitudes and behaviors of those who participate in it. The teacher often has the most powerful role in leading a classroom and how that class will interact and connect through the subject matter. The practice of self-disclosure in the interactions between the teachers and the students has an impact on the classroom atmosphere and how the people perform in that atmosphere. The decision to practice self-disclosure as a teacher has many benefits and challenges.

====Benefits====

When the teacher engages in self-disclosure with the students, it opens up a new channel of communication in the classroom. As the teacher shares more information about who they are and their personal life, the students begin to see a new side of their teacher that is more than the person that stands in the front of their classroom everyday. The teacher is seen as a real person with their own difficulties and struggles in life. This would allow the teacher to appear more relatable to the students which would promote better student to teacher communication. Of course, the information shared with the class must be appropriate and relevant. A teacher may use an illustration of a concept using an example from their own life in order to connect with a particular audience in the class. These connections with the teacher promotes a more productive relationship.

As the teacher sets the tone of self-disclosure, students feel more willing to share in the practice of self-disclosure as well. The teacher demonstrates and helps to guide the students in understanding what is appropriate information to share in public discourses.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tobin|first=Lad|year=2009|title=Self-Disclosure as a Strategic Teaching Tool|url=|journal=College English|volume=73|pages=196‚Äì206|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the students feel more comfortable with the teacher and begin sharing more about their own lives, the environment of the classroom is one of camaraderie and friendship. By understanding the people in the classroom on a deeper level can open up opportunities to provide support to those involved. The teacher can better understand who the students are, what they struggle with, what their strengths are and what they need to succeed. Self-disclosure from student to teacher allows the teacher to best support the students based on their individual needs, therefore providing an improved education.

====Challenges====

With implementing self-disclosure into the classroom, comes a set of negative consequences and challenges. As the teacher shares more about their personal life, the students may become overly comfortable with the teacher. This could lead to a lack of respect for the teacher or an inability to maintain appropriate superior relationship. Self-disclosure may blur the lines of the roles between the student and the teacher, which could disrupt the authority the teacher needs to maintain their role in the classroom and have an effective teaching persona.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is the case that not all students will connect to this method of teaching. Some students may not choose to participate in this environment which could lead them to feel alienated. Self-disclosure from the teacher needs to be taken into deep consideration so that the sharing of information does not take away from the education being transferred.

There are some risks involved in bringing self-disclosure into the classroom when students begin sharing information with the teacher. As the student is more open with the teacher, there is the chance that the student could share information that would require the teacher to follow a reporting procedure. If a student reveals information about themselves in confidence to the teacher that implies that the students life is potentially at risk, or other matters of equal seriousness that would need to be reported to the school guidance counselor. Revealing this information although confidentiality was implied would inevitably break the trust the teacher has built with the student, ultimately harming their relationship. This hurt relationship could negatively impact that students ability to learn in the classroom. In another scenario, students may not fully understand the differences between public and private discourse. This would lead students to have conversations of self-disclosure in the classroom when the timing is not appropriate, therefore, taking away from the educational matters at hand.

==Culture ==

Self-disclosure, just like anything varies and differs depending on the culture. Collectivistic culture and individualism are two types of ways to explain self disclosure is a culture. If a country is more on the collectivistic side then they will tend to disclose themselves more as an Avatar, like in China and Germany. However, in a more individualist culture setting people open up more about themselves, even personal details, like in America. There is also a difference in the boy vs. girl culture. Girls tend to open up more and easier than most boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wu|first=Betty|title=Differences in Self-Disclosure among Cultures and Genders: A Comparative Study in Online Social Networks|url=https://www.academia.edu/4595770/Differences_in_Self-Disclosure_among_Cultures_and_Genders_A_Comparative_Study_in_Online_Social_Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each culture has a different idea about what and how much self-disclosure is acceptable. For example, American students tend to share more in class with their peers than Chinese students. They are usually more open about themselves and interests with most of their classmates than students in other countries. The difference is seen in the internet as well. Korean students usually talk more in blog form on social media pages keeping the posts short and to the point. However, American students share more often and share more personal information to their followers. Cultures like Korea and China, the collectivistic cultures, are more reserved whereas, the American culture is more about disclosing a lot of personal details.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lizprovasi.wordpress.com/2012/04/25/self-disclosure-2-2/|title=Self-disclosure|last=Provasi|first=Elizabeth|date=2012-04-26|website=Cultural Connections|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Marathon Family''''' ({{lang-sh|Maratonci trƒçe poƒçasni krug}}, lit. ''Marathon Runners Do a Lap of Honour'', or often simply ''Maratonci'', lit. ''The Marathon Runners'') is a 1982 [[Cinema of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav black comedy film]] written by [[Du≈°an Kovaƒçeviƒá]] and directed by [[Serbia]]n director [[Slobodan ≈†ijan]]. It has become a [[cult film]] in Serbia and other countries from the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disintegration in Frames|last=Levi|first=Pavle|publisher=[[Stanford University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=9780804753685|page=60|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Sdi63FxE7EC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is regarded as one of the classics of Yugoslav Serbian cinematography.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Plot==
The story takes place in an unnamed small Serbian town in 1935, and focuses on the Topaloviƒá family consisting of six generations of [[undertaker]]s: gravely ill Pantelija, wheelchair-bound Maksimilijan who's also mute and nearly deaf, rheumatic Aksentije, sober-minded Milutin, impulsive and narcissistic Laki, and young and naive Mirko. Constantly bickering amongst each other, the latest family arguments arise from the youngest son, Mirko, not wanting to continue the family business of coffin-making. Deeply in love with a local girl Kristina, the daughter of a local hoodlum Bili Piton, he's looking to avoid the career path of his father, grandfather, great grandfather, etc. 

Though operating out of a prominently located shop in the town, Topaloviƒás' business is mostly based on illegal activities. Instead of making brand new coffins, they simply recycle already used ones with the help of Bili Piton, whose men dig them out from the local cemetery during the night. Once they get their hands on the coffins that had been dug up, Topaloviƒás simply refurbish them and sell them as new, thereby making a large profit with very little [[overhead cost|overhead]]. Based on mutual financial interest, the business relationship between Topaloviƒás and Bili is deteriorating by the day as they owe him a large sum of money for the past services rendered and show no intention of paying him.

In parallel, Topaloviƒás are in the finishing stages of building a modern [[crematory]] on which they're placing high hopes as the future source of income.

One day, the oldest Topaloviƒá, Pantelija, dies and leaves family inheritance to himself because he does not trust his successors. Topaloviƒás leave business with Bili Piton and he threatens to report them to the police for killing a man in a car accident. Bili's daughter, Mirko's love Kristina wishes to become an actress in (mostly pornographic) movies made by Mirko's best friend ƒêenka. However, she cheats on Mirko with ƒêenka, so outraged Mirko kills her when he finds out. He returns to his family and makes himself their leader by force, while ƒêenka is accidentally burned alive by the deaf Maksimilijan, while repairing the crematorium. The movie ends with a showdown between the Topaloviƒás and Bili Piton, in which Bili Piton is killed, and then a chase between Topaloviƒás and the police, with a scene abruptly cut just as raging Mirko attempts to run over a police officer fallen from a bicycle.

==Awards==
The Marathon Family won two awards in 1982, including the Jury Prize at the [[Montr√©al World Film Festival]] and the "Best Actress" award at the [[Pula Film Festival]], which went to [[Seka Sabliƒá]] for her portrayal of Kristina.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084302/awards?ref_=tt_awd imdb awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, thokchas were held in esteem for sacred metallurgical fabrication of weapons, musical instruments and sacred tools, e.g. [[phurba]]. Their inclusion as an auspicious addition in the metallurgical fabrication of sacred objects cast of [[Panchaloha]] is documented. The term has also come to denote ancient metal objects which serve as [[amulet]]s made from thokcha. They are traditionally held to be endowed with magic and protective power and in this respect are comparable to Tibetan [[Dzi bead]]s.

Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;234) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Meteoric iron or 'sky-iron' (Tib. gnam lcags) is the supreme substance for forging the physical representation of the [[vajra]] or other iron weapons, since it has already been tempered by the celestial gods in its passage across the heavens.  The indivisibility of form and emptiness is a perfect metaphor for the image of a meteorite or 'stone fallen from the sky', manifesting out of the voidness of space as a shooting star or fireball, and depositing a chunk of fused 'sky iron' on the earth below. Many vajras held by deities as weapons are described as being forged from meteorite iron, and Tibet, with its high altitude, thin atmosphere and desolate landscape, received an abundance of meteorite fragments. Tibetan vajras were often cast from meteorite iron, and as an act of sympathetic magic a piece of the meteoric iron was often returned to its original site."&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (1999).

==Age==
One can roughly divide the thokchas into two groups, the first comprising objects of pre-Buddhist period (from about 1000 BC until 900 AD), the second belonging to the Buddhist period (after 7th century AD), the two periods slightly overlapping. Some of the early thokchas may be related to the Tibetan [[Zhang zhung culture]].

==Types of thokchas==
Thokchas are metal objects which can have a length of about {{convert|2|-|15|cm}}. Originally they can have had a practical use such as having  been part of [[horse harness]]es, or having served as [[buckle]]s, [[Fibula_(brooch)|fibulae]] or [[arrow heads]]. 
They can have served as adornment for clothes or objects of daily use like lighters and purses.  Thokchas can represent mythological and real animals or deities from Tibet‚Äôs [[B√∂n]] or [[Buddhist]] religion. Many are of a more abstract form and the meaning of these pieces remains uncertain.

==Popular belief==
The word thokcha is composed of two words, ''thog'' meaning above, first or thunderbolt and ''lcags'' meaning iron or metal. The meaning of thokcha can thus be given as "first or original iron" or "thunderbolt iron". The popular belief is that thokchas can be formed naturally or magically when a thunderbolt strikes the earth. According to other beliefs thokchas are composed of [[meteor]]itical metal and found by chance on or under the ground by a lucky person. However, most of the thokchas were intentionally designed as amulets and are made of a copper alloy.&lt;ref&gt;Bellezza, John:http://www.asianart.com/articles/thogchags/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Three Colours'' trilogy''' ({{lang-pl|Trzy kolory}}, {{lang-fr|Trois couleurs}}) is the collective title of three [[film]]s directed by [[Krzysztof Kie≈õlowski]], two made in [[France|French]] and one primarily in [[Poland|Polish]]: ''[[Three Colours: Blue]]'' (1993), ''[[Three Colours: White]]'' (1994), and ''[[Three Colours: Red]]'' (1994). All three were co-written by Kie≈õlowski and [[Krzysztof Piesiewicz]]  (with story consultants [[Agnieszka Holland]] and [[S≈Çawomir Idziak]]) and have musical scores by [[Zbigniew Preisner]].

''Red'' received nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] at the [[67th Academy Awards]].

==Themes==
Blue, white, and red are the colours of the [[Flag of France|French flag]] in left-to-right order, and the story of each film is loosely based on one of the three political ideals in the motto of the [[French Republic]]: [[Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©|liberty, equality, fraternity]]. As with the treatment of the [[Ten Commandments]] in ''[[Dekalog]]'', the illustration of these principles is often ambiguous and ironic. As Kie≈õlowski noted in an interview with an [[Oxford University]] student newspaper, ‚ÄúThe words [''libert√©, egalit√©, fraternit√©''] are French because the money [to fund the films] is French. If the money had been of a different nationality we would have titled the films differently, or they might have had a different cultural connotation. But the films would probably have been the same.‚Äù{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

The trilogy is also interpreted&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-three-colors-trilogy-blue-white-red&lt;/ref&gt; respectively as an anti-tragedy, an [[anti-comedy]], and an [[anti-romance]].

==Connections and patterns==

A symbol common to the three films is that of an underlying link or thing that keeps the protagonist linked to their past. In the case of ''Blue'', it is the lamp of blue beads, and a symbol seen throughout the film in the TV of people falling (doing either [[sky diving]] or [[bungee jumping]]); the director is careful to show falls with no cords at the beginning of the film, but as the story develops the image of cords becomes more and more apparent as a symbol of a link to the past. In the case of ''White'' the item that links Karol to his past is a 2 Fr. coin and a plaster [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[Marianne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1386/seec.2.1.75_1 | volume=2 | title=Clandestine human and cinematic passages in the United Europe: The Polish Plumber and Kie≈õlowski's hairdresser | year=2011 | journal=Studies in Eastern European Cinema | pages=75‚Äì90 | last1 = Skrodzka-Bates | first1 = Aga}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he steals from an antique store in Paris. In the case of ''Red'' the judge never closes or locks his doors and his [[fountain pen]], which stops working at a crucial point in the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Leong|first=Anthony|title=Demystifying Three Colors: Blue|url=http://www.mediacircus.net/blue.html |publisher=Media Circus|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another recurring image related to the spirit of the film is that of elderly people recycling bottles: In ''Blue'', an old woman in Paris is recycling bottles and Julie does not notice her (in the spirit of freedom), in ''White'', an old man also in Paris is trying to recycle a bottle but cannot reach the container and Karol looks at him with a sinister grin on his face (in the spirit of equality) and in ''Red'' an old woman cannot reach the hole of the container and Valentine helps her (in the spirit of fraternity).

In ''Blue'', while Julie is searching for her husband's mistress in the central courthouse, she accidentally steps into an active court trial and is immediately turned around by security. While Julie is peeking into the courtroom, Karol from ''White'' can be heard pleading to the judge in a scene that begins his chapter of the trilogy.

Each films' ending shot is of a character crying. In ''Blue'', Julie de Courcy cries looking into space. In ''White'', Karol cries as he looks at his wife. In ''Red'', the judge Kern cries as he looks through his broken window out at the camera.

Many main characters from ''Blue'' and ''White'', including Julie and Karol, appear at the ending of ''Red'' as survivors of a ferry accident.

Waddell's correllations have not been generally accepted or well regarded, in part due to his use of the word [[Aryan]]. Conventional lists separate [[Sargon of Akkad|Sargon]] from [[Menes]] by around five hundred years. Commenting on this and other works, the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says "These works, containing much painstaking research and impressive to many, did not win the approval of experts."&lt;ref name="ArchBulletin"&gt;[http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 Moshenka, Gabriel., 'At Variance With Both General and Expert Opinion': The Later Works of Lieutenant-Colonel Professor Laurence Austine Waddell, Bulletin of the History of Archaeology, UCL Institute of Archaeology, 2010.] ({{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BjV5HK0i?url=http://www.archaeologybulletin.org/article/view/bha.20106/51 |date=October 27, 2012 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddell's primary chronology was compiled from various [[Sumerian king list]]s, Egyptian [[list of pharaohs]], the [[Bhagavata Purana]], [[Mahabharata]], [[Rigveda]] and numerous [[Indus Valley Civilization]] seals and other monuments and relics and sources, some of which he had deciphered himself.&lt;ref name="Preston2009"/&gt; It was entitled "Dated Chronological List of [[Sumer]]ian or Early [[Aryan]] Kings from the Rise of Civilization to the [[Kassites|Kassi Dynasty]]" and documented an alleged list of [[Sacred king|world emperor]]s as follows:

The '''Whoniverse''' is the non-narrative name given to the [[fictional universe|fictional setting]] of the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2012/08/doctor-who-science-fact/ |title='Doctor Who' Science Fact: Five Whovian Things That Exist In Real Life |author=Fraser McAlpine |date=2 August 2012 |website=BBC America ‚Äì Anglophenia }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Torchwood]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/capaldis-past-appearances-not-ignored-53407.htm |title=Capaldi's Past Whoniverse Appearances Not Ignored |date=28 September 2014 |publisher=Doctor Who TV }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' and ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'' as well as other [[Doctor Who spin-offs|related media]].&lt;ref&gt;Kistler (2013) Page 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Databank&gt;Lofficier (1992) [http://www.lofficier.com/dwfrwrd.html Foreword]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The term is used to link characters, ideas or items which are seen across multiple productions, such as [[Sarah Jane Smith]] from ''Doctor Who'', ''[[K-9 and Company]]'' (1981) and ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'' (2007‚Äì2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/18/entertainment/et-sarahjane18 |title=She's back in the Whoniverse |date=18 April 2008 |first=Robert |last=Lloyd |publisher=Los Angeles Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jack Harkness]] from ''Doctor Who'' and ''Torchwood'' as well as [[K-9 (Doctor Who)|K-9]] from ''Doctor Who'', ''K-9 and Company'', ''The Sarah Jane Adventures'', and ''[[K-9 (TV series)|K-9]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Unlike the owners of other science fiction franchises, the [[BBC]] takes no position on [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], and recent producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Russel T.|journal=Doctor Who Magazine|title=Doctor Who Magazine|year=2005|issue=356 |page={{page needed|date=March 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has recently begun to appear in [[mainstream]] press coverage following the popular success of the 2005 ''Doctor Who'' revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/jersey/content/articles/2007/07/12/bf07_dalek_cyberman_feature.shtml |first=Ryan| last=Morrison | title=Battle of Flowers: Cybermen and Dalek for Battle| journal=BBC Jersey| issue=| date=12 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/09/29/peter-capaldis-multiple-appearances-in-the-whoniverse-to-be-explained-by-an-old-russell-t-davies-idea/ |title=Peter Capaldi's Multiple Appearances In The Whoniverse To Be Explained By An Old Russell T Davies Idea |date=29 September 2013 |website=Bleeding Cool }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have also speculated that the ''[[Blake's 7]]'' series is also part of the same universe, due to a character known as Carnell appearing in the Blake's 7 episode, Weapon, who would also later appear in the Doctor Who novel, ''[[Corpse Marker]]'' and the ''[[Kaldor City]]'' spin-off audio series.

The Whoniverse is also referred to as Earth-5556.

==Features==
The Whoniverse has given rise to a wide variety of lifeforms, including the [[Time Lord]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/timelordorigins.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide ‚Äì The origins of the Time Lords |date= |website=BBC }} and {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/features/bulletins/bulletin_time_lords_history |title=Doctor Who ‚Äì A Brief History of Time Lords |date= |website=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Dalek]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory1.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide ‚Äì The first history of the Daleks |date= |website=BBC }} and {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/dalekhistory2.shtml |title=Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide ‚Äì The second history of the Daleks |date= |website=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kistler (2013) Page 33&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cyberman|Cybermen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rryyj/profiles/cybermen |title=Doctor Who, Series 7 Part 2 ‚Äì Cybermen |date= |website=BBC One }} and {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/characters/cybermen.shtml |title=Cult Television ‚Äì Doctor Who ‚Äì The Classic Series ‚Äì Characters ‚Äì The Cybermen |date= |website=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Sontaran]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0103y2x/profiles/sontarans |title=Doctor Who, Series 6 ‚Äì Sontarans |date= |website=BBC One }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Silurian (Doctor Who)|Silurians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rs69w/profiles/silurians |title=Doctor Who, Series 5 ‚Äì Silurians |date= |website=BBC One }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice Warrior]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rryyj/profiles/ice-warriors |title=Doctor Who, Series 7 Part 2 ‚Äì The Ice Warriors |date= |website=BBC One }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Weeping Angel]]s, who have appeared in several episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00wqr12/profiles/weeping-angels |title=Doctor Who, Series 7 Part 1 ‚Äì Weeping Angels |date= |website=BBC One }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[time travel]]ling nature of the show, the Whoniverse setting has been covered across points from its formation in a [[Big Bang|big bang]] event (in 1983's ''[[Terminus (Doctor Who)|Terminus]]'' and the 1985 audio drama ''[[Slipback]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01l185b |title=Doctor Who, Season 20, Terminus, Part 3, Terminus: Part 3 |date=22 February 2013 |website=BBC One }}&lt;/ref&gt; to its [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in the year "100 trillion" ("[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]" 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qltt |title=Doctor Who, Series 3, Utopia |date= |website=BBC One }} and {{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S3_11 |title=Doctor Who ‚Äì Utopia ‚Äì Episode Guide |date= |website=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Important events shown include the [[Time War (Doctor Who)|Time War]], the [[History of the Earth|formation of the Earth]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=330-Zdk5myk |title=Creation of the Earth ‚Äì Doctor Who ‚Äì The Runaway Bride |work=YouTube |publisher=BBC Worldwide }}&lt;/ref&gt; and its eventual destruction in the year "5 billion" ("[[The End of the World (Doctor Who)|The End of the World]]" 2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0074dmp |title=Doctor Who, Series 1, The End of the World |date= |website=BBC One }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the destruction and recreation of the universe ("[[The Pandorica Opens]]"/"[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]").{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

==Alternate usage==
{{Main|Doctor Who fandom}}
In his 1983 book ''Doctor Who: A Celebration; Two Decades Through Time and Space'', [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]] called his final chapter "The Whoniverse".&lt;ref name=OldMeaning/&gt; The section assembled factual information about all the episodes to date, but also gave information about fan clubs and ancillary entertainments related to the programme.  Thus, the term ''Whoniverse'' referred to everything connected with the programme behind-the-scenes.  In this meaning, standing exhibitions, discussions about the filming of episodes and even the [[Doctor Who fandom|fandom itself]] were considered part of the "Whoniverse".  The term ''Whoniverse'' is still used with this definition today,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://twitter.com/bbcdoctorwho/status/415942947998167040 |title=A message from Matt Smith: "To the Whoniverse, thanks a million.

Four percent of US public schools, mostly at the elementary level, use a '''year-round calendar'''.&lt;ref name="CRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43588.pdf |title=Year-Round Schools: In Brief |last= Skinner |first=Rebecca R. |date=2014 |publisher=Congressional Research Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 review&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=von Hippel |first=Paul T. |editor1-last=Alexander |editor1-first=Karl |editor2-last=Pitcock |editor2-first=Sarh |editor3-last=Boulay |editor3-first=Matthew |encyclopedia=The Summer Slide: What We Know and Can Do About Summer Learning Loss |title=The Summer Slide: What We Know and Can Do About Summer Learning Loss |url=https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=2766106 |date=2016 |publisher=New York City: Teachers College Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined the year-round school calendar as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike the much rarer ‚Äúextended-year‚Äù calendar, which can have more than 200 days of instruction, a year-round calendar does not increase instruction time. Instead, a year-round calendar takes the usual 175-180 instruction days and redistributes them, replacing the usual schedule -- nine months on, three months off -- with a more ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù schedule of short instruction periods alternating with shorter breaks across all four seasons of the year. There are several year-round calendars in use; the most popular alternate 9 or 12-week instruction periods with 3- or 4-week breaks. Year-round calendars include a summer break that is longer than other breaks during the year, but still shorter than the summer break on a traditional nine-month calendar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Effect on students, teachers, and families==

A 2016 review&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; summarized the research on year-round schools as follows&lt;blockquote&gt;The effects of year-round calendars on test scores...once thought to be positive...now appear to be neutral at best. Although year-round calendars do increase summer learning, they reduce learning at other times of year, so that the total amount learned over a 12-month period is no greater under a year-round calendar than under a nine-month calendar. [There is also] evidence that year-round calendars make it harder to recruit and retain experienced teachers, make it harder for mothers to work outside the home, and reduce property values.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition==

Businesses that rely on summer leisure time dislike year-round calendars.&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|title=Administrator's Guide to the Year-Round School|last=Thomas|first=Isaiah|publisher=Parker Publishing Company Inc.|year=1973|isbn=0-13-004903-4|location=West Nyack|pages=1‚Äì276}}&lt;/ref&gt; Summer camps and amusement parks often lead political opposition to year-round calendars, but some opposition is led by upper middle class parents who value summer vacations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rural areas rarely use year-round calendars because they conflict with farms' need for youth labor in summer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Costs==

Year-round calendars can offer a way to reduce school crowding, A crowded school can adopt a multi-track year-round calendar, which staggers student schedules so that different groups of students attend on different calendars, or "tracks," with some students attending while others are on break. In this way the school can handle more students than it could if all students needed to be in school at the same time.&lt;ref name=Graves&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graves|first=Jennifer|title=The academic impact of multi-track year-round calendars:  A response to school overcrowding|journal=Journal of Urban Economics|year=2010|volume=67|issue=3|pages=378‚Äì391|doi=10.1016/j.jue.2009.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multi-track year-round calendars have been used to reduce crowding in California, greater Las Vegas, and greater Raleigh, North Carolina, among other places."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Compared to other ways to handle crowding -- such as busing or portable classrooms -- multi-track year-round calendars can be relatively inexpensive. However, if schools are open for longer, the operating and maintenance costs may increase up to 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silva|first=Elena|title=On Clock: Rethinking the Way Schools Use Time|url=http://www.educationsector.org/publications/clock-rethinking-way-schools-use-time|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
