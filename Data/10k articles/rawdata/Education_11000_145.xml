      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4092">'''Student protests in Croatia 2009''' began at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the [[University of Zagreb]]. On Monday, 20 April 2009, the independent students' initiative for the right to free education started an occupation of the [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences]] in Zagreb, [[Croatia]]. The occupation lasted for 35 days, until 24 May, when the students voted to suspend the occupation.&lt;ref name=Dalje&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dalje.com/en-croatia/faculty-bloc-lifted-34-days-later/260322|title=Faculty Bloc Lifted 34 Days Later|last=Horvat|first=Karmen|work=Dalje.com|date=24 May 2009|accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students were protesting the Croatian government's plans to reduce public funding for higher education, which had been provided free until recently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2009/05/04/feature-02|title=Student protests sweep Croatian universities|work=Southeast European Times|last=Radic|first=Natasa|date=4 May 2009|accessdate=11 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}

The occupation in Zagreb spread next day to the [[University of Zadar]] (where the entire university was blocked) and then to other cities in the country, including [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Pula]], [[Rijeka]] and [[Osijek]]. During those 35 days, around 20 faculties and universities in eight Croatian cities were occupied at some point.

The students who organized the occupation demanded the right to free education for all and the elimination of all tuition fees, at all levels of higher education: undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate. During the occupation, everyone was free to enter and leave the faculty buildings, but regular classes were not held. Instead, students organized an alternative educational program, which consisted of lectures, public discussions, workshops, movie screenings and other events. Everyone was free to attend these happenings, whether they were students or not. Only the regular classes were blocked – the administration, the library, the bookshop and other facilities within the faculty building were allowed to function as usual.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The central organ of student decision making at the occupied faculty called plenum was set up. All decisions were made in a direct democratic manner, including whether the student occupation of the faculty should be continued or ended. The plenum was an assembly of all interested students and other citizens and everyone had the right to speak and vote. All decisions were made by the majority of all present participants.

The initial occupation in Zagreb ended soon after the university administration announced that sanctions would be imposed if the action were not ended.&lt;ref name=Dalje/&gt;

On 23 November the students again occupied the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb. After nearly two weeks, the plenum, voted to end the occupation on 4 December.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

They have received letters of support from individuals and organizations, both from Croatia and from abroad. Among those who have expressed support for their cause were [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref name=Dalje/&gt; [[Judith Butler]]&lt;ref&gt;http://slobodnifilozofski.org/?p=455&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Slavoj Žižek]].&lt;ref name=Dalje/&gt;

The students of Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences in Zagreb wrote a manual called ''The Occupation Cookbook'' in which they described the functioning of their faculty during the occupation.

'''Academies Financial Handbook''' is a handbook issued by [[Education and Skills Funding Agency]] in England that describes financial requirements for [[Academy (English school)|academy trusts]]. It was first published 1 July 2016 and last updated 27 July 2017. 
&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|title=Academies Financial Handbook|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academies-financial-handbook|website=GOV.UK|accessdate=12 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

'''Academy schools''' are [[State-funded schools (England)|state-funded schools]] in [[England]] which are directly funded by the [[Department for Education]] and independent of [[local authority]] control. The terms of the arrangements are set out in individual Academy Funding Agreements.&lt;ref name="IndividualFundingAgreements"&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Funding Agreement? {{!}} a can of worms|url=http://davidwolfe.org.uk/wordpress/archives/241|website=davidwolfe.org.uk|accessdate=4 January 2018|date=8 October 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104192422/http://davidwolfe.org.uk/wordpress/archives/241|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AcademyFundingAgreement"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy and Free School Master Funding Agreement|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388471/Academy_and_free_school_-_master_funding_agreement.pdf|publisher=Gov.uk|accessdate=18 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010032820/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/388471/Academy_and_free_school_-_master_funding_agreement.pdf|archivedate=10 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most academies are [[secondary school]]s (and most secondary schools are academies). However, slightly more than 25% of [[primary school]]s (4363 as at December 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Schools, pupils, and their characteristics (Official Statistics)|url=http://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2012|date=13 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180114020225/https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2012|archivedate=14 January 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There are no academies in Wales or Scotland where education has been devolved

Academies are self-governing [[non-profit]] [[Charitable trusts in English law|charitable trusts]] and may receive additional support from personal or corporate sponsors, either financially or in kind.&lt;ref name=CharityCommission&gt;{{cite web|title=Charities and charity trustees: an introduction for school governors|url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Charity_requirements_guidance/Specialist_guidance/Education/introduction_for_school_governors.aspx|work=Charity Commission website|publisher=Charity Commission|accessdate=3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Education Funding Agency]] monitors financial management and governance of academies. In March 2016 the [[Perry Beeches The Academy|Perry Beeches The Academy Trust]], a multi-academy trust, was found to have deleted financial records for £2.5 million of free school meal funding, and that the chief executive was being paid by sub-contractors as well as by the trust. Its schools are likely to be taken over by a new trust.&lt;ref name="guardian-20160328"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/28/perry-beeches-academy-chain-stripped-schools-critical-finance-report |title=Lauded academy chain to be stripped of schools after finances inquiry |author=Richard Adams |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 March 2016 |accessdate=28 March 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328205955/http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/mar/28/perry-beeches-academy-chain-stripped-schools-critical-finance-report |archivedate=28 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2016, the former principal and founder of [[Kings Science Academy]], the former finance director, and a former teacher who was the founder's sister were found guilty of defrauding public funds of £150,000.&lt;ref name="bbc-20160801"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-36943526 |title=Bradford Kings Science academy staff convicted of fraud |work=BBC News |date=1 August 2016 |accessdate=1 August 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801141259/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-36943526 |archivedate=1 August 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[Wakefield City Academies Trust]] collapsed, and ''[[The Observer]]'' reported that "Wakefield City Academies Trust now stands accused of 'asset stripping” after it transferred millions of pounds of the schools’ savings to its own accounts before collapsing. On 8 September it released a statement announcing it would divest itself of its 21 schools as it could not undertake the ´rapid improvement our academies need' ".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Perraudin|first1=Frances|title=Collapsing academy trust ‘asset-stripped its schools of millions’|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/21/collapsing-wakefield-city-academies-trust-asset-stripped-schools-millions-say-furious-parents|accessdate=22 October 2017|work=The Observer|date=21 October 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021233011/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/oct/21/collapsing-wakefield-city-academies-trust-asset-stripped-schools-millions-say-furious-parents|archivedate=21 October 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Academies Financial Handbook''' describes the correct way of managing public assets. 'Compliance with the handbook is a condition of each trust’s funding agreement'.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

==Document==
The Academies Financial Handbook sets out the financial management, control and reporting requirements that apply to all academy trusts. It describes a financial framework for trusts that focuses on principles rather than detailed guidance and reflects their accountability to Parliament and to the public.&lt;ref name=gov/&gt;

It is sixty sides long, and is divided into 4 sections with a foreword and appendices.&lt;ref name="pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Academies Financial Handbook 2017|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/633375/Academies_Financial_Handbook_2017.pdf|website=gov.uk|accessdate=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance==
Some governing bodies have difficulty with the document.  The Commons public accounts committee concluded that “too often academy trusts are falling short” of the “highest standards of governance, accountability and financial management” and that the Department for Education is often “too slow to react”.&lt;ref name=silverbirch&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savage|first1=Michael|last2=Mansell|first2=Warwick|title=Silver Birch Academy Trust in spotlight again over spending|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/12/silver-birch-academy-trusts-spending-in-spotlight|accessdate=12 May 2018|work=the Guardian|date=12 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2018, the Guardian highlighted the failings in one multi-academy trust comprising four primary schools. The schools serving 2000 pupils were awarding the head a salary in excess of £211,082 which had been raised by 10% from the year before. She had taken  £6 250 to fund a fact finding mission to the far east. In 2014, £26,000 had been spent on refurbishing the heads office.Four of her staff had been issued with £1 250 laptops while the school had been running an in-year deficit of almost £1 000 000. “Discussions with both the head and the acting chair of the board demonstrated a poor understanding of the current financial situation of the trust.” Also criticised was the way that large contracts for consultancy and advertising were taken out without following the tender procedure, and invoices could be produced.&lt;ref name=silverbirch/&gt;

Journals use a variety of ways to generate the income required to cover publishing costs (including editorial costs, any costs of administering the peer review system), such as subsidies from institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suber|first=Peter|title=Open access|year=2012|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262517638|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Subscription business model|subscriptions]].

APC fees applied to academic research are usually expensive, effectively limiting open access circulation among the less affluent institutions, scholars, and students. 

APC model of open access, among other controversies — is part of the wider and increasing global Open Access OA's ethics debate (see for example Kember, S., 2014, 'Opening Out from Open Access: Writing and Publishing in Response to Neoliberalism'; Kember, S. 2016, 'How Open is Open Access?'; Page, B. 2018, 'Angry Publishers Debate OA monographs at IPG')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kember|first1=Sarah|title=Opening Out from Open Access: Writing and Publishing in Response to Neoliberalism|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2014/04/|website=ADA|accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Different academic publishers have widely varying levels of fees, from under $100 to over $3000.&lt;ref name=solomon /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://openscience.com/how-much-do-top-publishers-charge-for-open-access/ |title=How Much Do Top Publishers Charge for Open Access?  |first=Beata |last=Socha |work=[[OpenScience]] |date=20 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=García Martín|first=Miguel|date=2015-12-30|title=Las revistas de Geografía en el Journal Citation Reports: lucro económico versus acceso abierto|url=http://redc.revistas.csic.es/index.php/redc/article/view/908|journal=Revista española de Documentación Científica|language=es|volume=38|issue=4|pages=105|doi=10.3989/redc.2015.4.1248|issn=1988-4621|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; High fees are sometimes charged by traditional publishers in order to publish in a [[hybrid open access journal]], which make an individual article in a subscription journal open access. The average APC for hybrid journals has been calculated to be almost twice as high as APCs from full open access publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Solomon|first2=David|date=March 2014|year=|title=Developing an Effective Market for Open Access Article Processing Charges|url=https://wellcome.ac.uk/sites/default/files/developing-effective-market-for-open-access-article-processing-charges-mar14.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=|last1=Björk|first1=Bo-Christer|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journals with high [[impact factors]] from major publishers tend to have the highest APCs.&lt;ref name=solomon /&gt; Many open access publishers, such as [[PLOS]], waive their APCs for those who cannot afford to pay them.&lt;ref name=PLOS&gt;{{cite web|title=Publication fees|url=http://www.plos.org/publish/pricing-policy/publication-fees/|work=PLOS|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Open access articles often have a surcharge compared to a closed-access APC; for example the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' regularly charges $1700 per article, with a surcharge of $1350 for open-access.&lt;ref name=PNAS&gt;PNAS, [http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/fees.xhtml Procedures for Submitting Manuscripts]&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[American Geophysical Union|AGU]]'s ''[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]'' charges $1000 for closed-access and $3500 for open-access.&lt;ref name=AGU&gt;[http://sites.agu.org/publications/files/2014/08/pubfeetablefinalAug2014.pdf American Geophysical Union publication fee table]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when publishers do not charge standard fees, excess or overlength fees might still apply after a certain number of pages or publication units is exceeded;&lt;ref name=AGU/&gt;&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite web|title=(IEEE) 2014 Voluntary Page and Overlength Article Charges |url=http://www.ieee.org/advertisement/2012vpcopc.pdf|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional fees might exist for color figures,&lt;ref name=PNAS/&gt; primarily for print journals that are not online-only.

{{anchor|Submission fee}}While publication charges occur upon article acceptance, article '''submission fees''' are charged prior to the start of [[Scholarly peer review|peer review]]; they are not uncommon among journals in some fields, e.g., finance and economics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Journals with Fees for Submitted Paper| url=http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/jfees.html|accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{anchor|Page charge}}'''Page charge''' may refer to either publication or submission fees.

==Criticism==

The "[[article processing charge]]s" which are often used for open access journals shift the burden of payment from readers to authors (or their funders), which creates a new set of concerns.&lt;ref name="Socha"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://openscience.com/how-much-do-top-publishers-charge-for-open-access/ |title=How Much Do Top Publishers Charge for Open Access? |first=Beata |last=Socha |work=openscience.com |date=20 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; One concern is that if a publisher makes a profit from accepting papers, it has an incentive to accept anything submitted, rather than selecting and rejecting articles based on quality. This could be remedied, however, by charging for the peer-review rather than acceptance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, S.]] (2010) [http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july10/harnad/07harnad.html No-Fault Peer Review Charges: The Price of Selectivity Need Not Be Access Denied or Delayed] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501123717/http://dlib.org/dlib/july10/harnad/07harnad.html |date=2011-05-01 }}. ''D-Lib Magazine'' 16 (7/8)&lt;/ref&gt; Another concern is that institutional budgets may need to be adjusted in order to provide funding for the article processing charges required to publish in many open access journals (e.g. those published by [[BioMed Central]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/apcfaq#why |title=Article-processing charges FAQ |publisher=BioMed Central |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126143503/http://www.biomedcentral.com/info/authors/apcfaq#why |archivedate=2011-11-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;). It has been argued that this may reduce the ability to publish research results due to lack of sufficient funds, leading to some research not becoming a part of the public record.&lt;ref&gt;Eftekhari, A (2012) [http://research.criticpen.com/article/open-access-dream-m4zh Open Access Dream]. ''Critic Pen''.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130505174602/http://research.criticpen.com/article/open-access-dream-m4zh |date=May 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless discounts are available to authors from countries with low incomes or external funding is provided to cover the cost, article processing charges could exclude authors from developing countries or less well-funded research fields from publishing in open access journals. However, under the traditional model, the prohibitive costs of some non-open access journal subscriptions already place a heavy burden on the research community; and if green open access [[self-archiving]] eventually makes subscriptions unsustainable, the cancelled subscription savings can pay the [[gold open access]] publishing costs without the need to divert extra money from research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harnad |first1=S. |authorlink=Stevan Harnad |year=2011 |title=Gold Open Access Publishing Must Not Be Allowed to Retard the Progress of Green Open Access Self-Archiving |url=http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21818/ |journal=Logos |volume=21 |issue=3–4 |pages=86–93 |doi=10.1163/095796511x559972 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110901173641/http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/21818/ |archivedate=2011-09-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many open access publishers offer discounts or publishing fee waivers to authors from developing countries or those suffering financial hardship. Self-archiving of non-open access publications provides a low cost alternative model.&lt;ref&gt;Corrado, E. (Spring 2005). [http://www.istl.org/05-spring/article2.html The importance of Open Access, Open Source, and Open Standards for libraries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216144534/http://www.istl.org/05-spring/article2.html |date=2011-12-16 }}. Issues in Science and Technology Librarianship.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another concern is the redirection of money by major funding agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the [[Wellcome Trust]] from the direct support of research to the support of open access publication. Robert Terry, Senior Policy Advisor at the Wellcome Trust, has said that he feels that 1–2% of their research budget will change from the creation of knowledge to the dissemination of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Open Access Now |title=Interview – Wellcome support for Open Access |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&amp;issue=18 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821073435/http://www.biomedcentral.com/openaccess/archive/?page=features&amp;issue=18 |archivedate=August 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research institutions could cover the cost of open access by converting to an open access journal cost-recovery model, with the institutions' annual tool access subscription savings being available to cover annual open access publication costs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, S]] (2007) [https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265753/1/greenroad.html "The Green Road to Open Access: A Leveraged Transition"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170123021048/http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/265753/1/greenroad.html |date=2017-01-23 }}. In: Anna Gacs. ''The Culture of Periodicals from the Perspective of the Electronic Age''. L'Harmattan. 99–106. Retrieved 2012-11-19.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study by the [[Max Planck Society]] the annual turnovers of academic publishers amount to approximately EUR 7.6 billion. It is argued that this money comes predominantly from publicly funded scientific libraries as they purchase subscriptions or licenses in order to provide access to scientific journals for their members. The study was presented by the Max Planck Digital Library and found that subscription budgets would be sufficient to fund the open access publication charges.&lt;ref name="Max Planck Gesellschaft"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mpg.de/9202262/area-wide-transition-open-access |title=Area-wide transition to open access is possible: A new study calculates a redeployment of funds in Open Access |date=27 April 2015 |website=www.mpg.de/en |publisher=Max Planck Gesellschaft |access-date=2017-05-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616161356/https://www.mpg.de/9202262/area-wide-transition-open-access |archivedate=16 June 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10953">In classrooms where '''assessment for learning''' is practised, students are encouraged to be more active in their learning and associated assessment. The ultimate purpose of assessment for learning is to create self-regulated learners who can leave school able and confident to continue learning throughout their lives. Teachers need to know at the outset of a unit of study where their students are in terms of their learning and then continually check on how they are progressing through strengthening the feedback they get from their learners. Students are guided on what they are expected to learn and what quality work looks like.  The teacher will work with the student to understand and identify any gaps or misconceptions (initial/diagnostic [[Educational assessment|assessment]]). As the unit progresses, the teacher and student work together to assess the student's knowledge, what she or he needs to learn to improve and extend this knowledge, and how the student can best get to that point ([[formative assessment]]). Assessment for learning occurs at all stages of the learning process.

Researchers whose work has informed much of this assessment reform include Ken O'Connor, Grant Wiggins,&lt;ref name=ltag&gt;http://www.ltag.education.tas.gov.au&lt;/ref&gt; Jay McTighe,&lt;ref name=ltag/&gt; Richard Stiggins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assessmentinst.com/author/rick-stiggins/|title=Assessment Training Institute|website=www.assessmentinst.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Black, [[Dylan Wiliam]], Chris Harrison, Bethan Marshall, Gordon Stobart, Caroline Gipps, Joanna Goodman, Thomas Guskey, Damian Cooper,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.damiancooperassessment.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Philippe Perrenoud, Royce Sadler, Bronwen Cowie, Margaret Heritage and Ronán Howe.

==Historical perspective==
In past decades, teachers would design a unit of study that would typically include objectives, teaching strategies, and resources.  The student's mark on this test or exam was taken as the indicator of his or her understanding of the topic. In 1998, Black &amp; Wiliam produced a review that highlighted that students who learn in a formative way achieve significantly better than matched control groups receiving normal teaching. Their seminal work developed into several important research projects on Assessment for Learning by the King's College team including Kings-Medway-Oxfordshire Formative Assessment Project (KMOFAP), Assessment is For learning (Scotland), Jersey-Actioning-Formative assessment (Channel Islands), and smaller projects in England, Wales, Peru, and the USA.

==Complex assessment==
A complex assessment is the one that requires a rubric and an expert examiner. Example items for complex assessment include thesis, funding proposal, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Ho Sung Kim, Quantification for complex assessment: uncertainty estimation in final year project thesis assessment, European Journal of Engineering Education, 2013, pp 1-16 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2012.742869&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Ho Sung Kim, Uncertainty analysis for peer assessment final year project, European Journal of Engineering Education, Vol 39 (1), 2014, pp 68-83 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03043797.2013.833171&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of assessment is due to the format implicitness. In the past it has been puzzling to deal with the ambiguous assessment criteria for final year project (FYP) thesis assessment. Webster, Pepper and Jenkins (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Webster, F., D. Pepper, and A. Jenkins. 2000. “Assessing the undergraduate dissertation.” Assessment &amp; Evaluation in
Higher Education, 25 (1): 71–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
discussed some common general criteria for FYP thesis and their ambiguity regarding use, meaning and application. Woolf (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, H., 2004. “Assessment criteria: reflections on current practices.” Assessment and Evaluation in Higher Education,
29 (4): 439–493.&lt;/ref&gt;
more specifically stated on the FYP assessment criterion weighting:‘The departments are as silent on the weightings that they apply to their criteria as they are on the
number of criteria that contribute to a grade’. A more serious concern was raised by Shay (2004) who argued that the FYP assessment for engineering and social sciences is ‘a socially situated
interpretive act’, implying that many different alternative interpretations and grades are possible for one assessment task. The problems with the FYP thesis assessment have thus received much
attention over the decades since the assessment difficulty was discussed by Black (1975).&lt;ref&gt;Black, J., 1975. “Allocation and assessment of project work in the final year of engineering degree course at the University of Bath”. Assessment in Higher Education, 1 (1): 35–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
There are a number of assessment terms that will appear in any discussion of assessment. Listed below are common interpretations of some of these terms:

'''Assessment'''
A working definition of [[Educational assessment|Assessment]] for learning from a widely cited article contends:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"the term 'assessment' refers to all those activities undertaken,,,
by teachers, and by their students in assessing themselves, which
provide information to be used as feedback to modify the teaching and learning activities in which they are engaged.&lt;ref name="BlackBox"&gt;Black, P.J. &amp; Wiliam, D. (1998) Inside the Black Box: Raising standards through classroom assessment. King's College, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since this seminal article, educators have differentiated assessment according to its purpose:

'''Assessment for learning'''

*comprises two phases—initial or diagnostic assessment and formative assessment
*assessment can be based on a variety of information sources (e.g., portfolios, works in progress, teacher observation, conversation)
*verbal or written feedback to the student is primarily descriptive and emphasizes strengths, identifies challenges, and points to next steps
*as teachers check on understanding they adjust their instruction to keep students on track
*no grades or scores are given - record-keeping is primarily anecdotal and descriptive
*occurs throughout the learning process, from the outset of the course of study to the time of summative assessment

'''Assessment as learning'''
*begins as students become aware of the goals of instruction and the criteria for performance
*involves goal-setting, monitoring progress, and reflecting on results
*implies student ownership and responsibility for moving his or her thinking forward (metacognition)
*occurs throughout the learning process

'''Assessment of learning'''
*assessment that is accompanied by a number or letter grade (summative)
*compares one student's achievement with standards
*results can be communicated to the student and parents
*occurs at the end of the learning unit

'''Evaluation'''
*judgment made on the basis of a student's performance

'''Diagnostic assessment (now referred to more often as "pre-assessment")
*assessment made to determine what a student does and does not know about a topic
*assessment made to determine a student's learning style or preferences
*used to determine how well a student can perform a certain set of skills related to a particular subject or group of subjects
*occurs at the beginning of a unit of study
*used to inform instruction:makes up the initial phase of assessment for learning

'''Formative assessment'''
*assessment made to determine a student's knowledge and skills, including learning gaps as they progress through a unit of study
*used to inform instruction and guide learning
*occurs during the course of a unit of study
*makes up the subsequent phase of assessment for learning

'''Summative assessment'''
*assessment that is made at the end of a unit of study to determine the level of understanding the student has achieved
*includes a mark or grade against an expected standard

==Principles==
Among the most comprehensive listing of principles of assessment for learning are those written by the QCA (Qualifications and Curriculum Authority). The authority, which is sponsored by England's [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]], is responsible for national curriculum, assessment, and examinations. Their principal focus is on crucial aspects of assessment for learning, including how such assessment should be seen as central to classroom practice, and that all teachers should regard assessment for learning as a key professional skill.

The UK Assessment Reform Group (1999) identifies "The big 5 principles of assessment for learning"

# The provision of effective feedback to students.
# The active involvement of students in their own learning.
# Adjusting teaching to take account of the results of assessment.
# Recognition of the profound influence assessment has on the motivation and self-esteem of pupils, both of which are critical influences on learning.
# The need for students to be able to assess themselves and understand how to improve.

===Feedback===

The purpose of an Assessment for Learning (AFL) task is to provide feedback to both the teacher and learner regarding the learner's progress towards achieving the learning objective(s).  This feedback should be used by the teacher to revise and develop further instruction.  An effective AFL method is to use a performance task coupled with a [[Rubric (academic)|rubric]]. This type of assessment is fundamental in illustrating how and why such principles need to be adhered to.

'''Ben Bard''' (January 26, 1893 – May 17, 1974) was an American movie actor, stage actor, and acting teacher. With [[comedian]] [[Jack Pearl]], Bard worked in a [[comedy]] [[Double act|duo]] in [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie Joe, Jr.|title=Vaudeville: From the Honky-tonks to the Palace |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jZe0AAAAIAAJ |location=[[New York City|New York]]|publisher=[[Henry Holt and Company|Henry Holt]]|year=1953|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1926, Bard, Pearl, and Sascha Beaumont appeared in a [[short film]] made in [[Lee DeForest]]'s [[Phonofilm]] [[sound-on-film]] process. He had a [[Bit part|small role]] in ''[[The Bat Whispers]]'' (1930). Later in the decade, he ran a leading [[Hollywood]] [[Drama school|acting school]], Ben Bard Drama.

Bard was recruited to be a [[leading man]] at [[Fox Film Corporation]]. However, he was [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a "Suave Heavy"&amp;mdash;a smooth-talking, well-dressed fellow with a dark side. An example of this type is his portrayal of "Mr. Brun" in ''[[The Seventh Victim]]'' (1943). Also in 1943, Bard appeared in two other [[Val Lewton]]-produced [[Horror film|horror films]]: ''[[The Leopard Man]]'', as Robles, the [[Chief of police|Police Chief]], and ''[[The Ghost Ship]]'', as [[First officer (aeronautics)|First Officer]] Bowns.

Bard became the head of the New Talent Department at [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth-Century-Fox]] in September 1956,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |last1=Schallert |first1=Edwin |title=Rory Calhoun Aligns With Independents; New Plays Due; Bard Signs |date=September 12, 1956 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/162148444/ |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |location=Los Angeles, California |volume=75 |issue=9 |page=25 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually resigning in August 1959. He re-opened his school, Ben Bard Drama, in 1960.

==Personal life==
* In 1929 he married the [[serial film]] star [[Ruth Roland]], and was married to Roland until her death in 1937.
* In 1939, he married Roma Clarisse, an actress and last recipient of the Ruth Roland Scholarship to Ben Bard Drama. They had 3 children before she died in 1947.
* In 1948 Bard married [[Jackie Lynn Taylor]], an actress in the ''[[Our Gang]]'' series. They divorced in 1954.

==Death==
Bard died in Los Angeles in 1974, aged 81. His resting place is with [[Ruth Roland]] in an unmarked grave at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].&lt;ref name="Wilson2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Scott Wilson|title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DgDAAAQBAJ|edition=3rd|volume=1|date=22 August 2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-7992-4|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is survived by his two sons, Bryan Barak Bard, a video documentary artist, and Bartley Bard, a professional director and screenwriter. {{cn|date=May 2014}}

The '''British Families Education Service''' ('''BFES''') was an organisation set up by the [[British Government]] in 1946 to run schools for the children of British military and government personnel serving in [[West Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Education Archives Subject Guide No. 4: Post-War Reconstruction|url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/services/documents/SG4_post-war_educational_reconstruction_(March_2009).pdf|publisher=[[Institute of Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to 1946, [[Royal Army Educational Corps|Army Education Corps]] was responsible for the training of teachers ([[Queen's Army Schoolmistresses]]) to teach soldiers' children at garrisons. With the end of [[World War II]] and the establishment of the [[British Army on the Rhine]] as part of [[Allied-occupied Germany|the Allied occupation of Germany]], personnel were allowed to bring their families over through "Operation Union". This presented a problem for the [[War Office]] as these children needed to attend school. BFES was established by the [[Foreign Office]] in cooperation with the War Office and [[Ministry of Education (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Education]].&lt;ref name="IOE archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=British Families Education Service/Service Children's Education Association archive: History|url=http://libguides.ioe.ac.uk/content.php?pid=452102&amp;sid=3704784|publisher=[[Institute of Education]]|date=3 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first school officially opened by the BFES was [[Prince Rupert School]], then located at the coastal town of [[Wilhelmshaven]]. [[Local education authority|LEA]]s were asked to aid in the recruitment of teachers to the newly opened schools in Germany.
Two other boarding schools were open during the 1950s.  One at Hamm, and another (King Alfred's School) at Plon in Northern Germany.  This second school was originally a German naval cadet training centre.  During the period 1957-1959, it housed some 700 pupils - half boys, half girls - providing wonderful facilities. At the end of the school year in 1959, it was formally handed back to the German Navy.

Over the years, the BFES and its later incarnations opened schools at [[British Armed Forces]] bases around the world, such as in [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[British Forces Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Crown Colony of Malta|Malta]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Mauritius]] and [[British Malaya|Malaya]].

==Later years==
During the early 1980s, BFES became the Service Children's Education Authority (SCEA), an agency overseen by the [[British Army]]. In 1989 it came under a new administration and was renamed Service Children's Schools (SCS) before adopting its current name Service Children's Education (SCE).&lt;ref name="IOE archives"/&gt;

'''Caspar Bartholin the Elder''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑr|ˈ|t|oʊ|l|ɪ|n|,_|ˈ|b|ɑr|t|əl|ɪ|n}}; 12 February 1585 – 13 July 1629) was born at [[Malmö|Malmø]], [[Denmark]] (modern [[Sweden]]) and was a [[polymath]], finally accepting a professorship in [[medicine]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]], Denmark, in 1613. He later taught [[theology]] at the same university.

His precocity was extraordinary; at three years of age he was able to read, and in his thirteenth year he composed [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] orations and delivered them in public. When he was about eighteen he went to the [[University of Copenhagen]] and afterwards studied at [[University of Rostock|Rostock]] and [[university of Wittenberg|Wittenberg]].

He then travelled through Germany, the Netherlands, England, France and Italy, and was received with marked respect at the different universities he visited. In 1613 he was chosen professor of medicine in the University of Copenhagen, and filled that office for eleven years, when, falling into a dangerous illness, he made a vow that if he should recover he would apply himself solely to the study of [[divinity]]. He fulfilled his vow by becoming professor of divinity at Copenhagen and [[canon (priest)|canon]] of [[Roskilde]]. He died on 13 July 1629 at [[Sorø]] in [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]].

His work, ''Anatomicae Institutiones Corporis Humani'' (1611) was for many years a standard textbook on the subject of [[anatomy]].  He was the first to describe the workings of the [[olfactory nerve]].

Of his sons, two, [[Thomas Bartholin|Thomas]] and [[Erasmus Bartholinus|Erasmus]], were also noted scholars.

'''Certified Social Engineering Prevention Specialist''' ('''CSEPS''') refers to both an individual [[Mitnick Security Consulting]] certification and a broader [[professional certification]] program.

The CSEPS program currently offers one type of certification. To attain this certification, a candidate must attend a CSEPS training course and pass the exam proctored at completion.

The training program focuses primarily on how [[Social engineering (security)|Social Engineering]] works through the use of numerous case histories and a detailed breakdown of the [[List of cognitive biases|psychological principles related to influence]]. It more specifically focuses on how a malicious hacker or information thief uses Social Engineering and/or [[Pretexting]] to obtain illicit access to [[computer systems]] by duping employees, and what can be done to minimize social engineering based attacks in an organization.

The course and exam costs approximately [[US dollar|US$]]2300.00 per person. The course is two days in length. The exams takes between 1 and 2 hours to complete and consists of between 50-90 multiple choice questions and an essay section dealing with specific actions taken to prevent Social Engineering in a proposed scenario.

The exam was first designed by [[Kevin Mitnick]] and [[Alexis Kasperavičius]] in 2004, with assistance from various experts in the psychology field.

The '''Chemistry Quality Eurolabels''' or '''European Quality Labels in Chemistry''' ('''Labels européens de Qualité en Chimie''') is a marketing scheme for chemistry degrees at institutions located within the 45 countries involved in the [[Bologna process]]. Labels are awarded to qualifying institutions under the names are '''Eurobachelor''' and '''Euromaster''', as well as the proposed '''Eurodoctorate'''. [[Label Committee]] not only prepares for the [[ECTN Administrative Council]] proposals to award the [[Eurolabels]] but also judge the quality of chemical education programmes at [[Higher education|HEIs]]. [[ECTN]] and its [[Label Committee]] closely collaborates with [[EuCheMS]] and [[American Chemical Society]].

It is a [[Conceptual framework|framework]] which is supported by [[EuCheMS]], and the labels are awarded by [[ECTN]]. The project is supported by the [[European Commission]] (EC) through its [[SOCRATES programme]]. The purpose of the framework is to "promote recognition of [[first cycle degree|first]], [[second cycle degree]]s, and [[third cycle degree]]s not only within the 45 countries involved in the [[Bologna process]]".

==History==
[[European Union]] promoted the [[Bologna process]] and the creation of a single [[European higher education area]], both of which require mobility of graduates across Europe.

[[ECTN]] ([[European Chemistry Thematic Network]]) worked in the EU project "[[Tuning Educational Structures in Europe]]" and developed [[Eurobachelor]], a framework for a [[first cycle qualification]] ([[Undergraduate degree|first degree]]) in [[chemistry]]. [[EuCheMS]] approved Eurobachelor in October 2003.&lt;ref name="eubach"&gt;Mitchell T.N., Whewell R.J.: [http://files.gandi.ws/gandi22757/file/2-eurobachelor_documentation-150613.pdf The Chemistry "Eurobachelor®"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004 the [[Bologna process seminar]] "[[Chemistry Studies in the European Higher Education Area]]" approved Eurobachelor.&lt;ref name="eubach"/&gt;

==Eurobachelor==
'''Eurobachelor''' is a [[registered trademark]] and an initiative adopted by the [[EuCheMS]] General Assembly in 2003. It is associated with the Chemistry Quality Eurolabels. As of 8 April 2013, 60 Eurobachelor quality labels have been awarded. The label is intended for [[first cycle qualification]]s ([[bachelor's degree]]s).

Eurobachelor is based on 180 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation|ECTS]] ([[European credits]]), which is comparable to the three-year British degrees, but it does not include the British concepts of [[honours degrees]] and [[ordinary degree|ordinary degrees.]]&lt;ref name="eubach" /&gt;

==Euromaster==
'''Euromaster''' is a [[registered trademark]] and an initiative adopted by the [[EuCheMS]] General Assembly in 2005. It is associated with the Chemistry Quality Eurolabels. As of 8 April 2013, 36 Euromaster quality labels have been awarded. The label is intended for [[master's degree]]s.

Euromaster, introduced after Eurobachelor, is intended for [[second cycle qualification]]s ([[postgraduate degree]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell T.N.: [http://files.gandi.ws/gandi22757/file/2-euromaster_documentation-150101.pdf The Chemistry "Euromaster®"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eurodoctorate==
'''Eurodoctorate''' is associated with the Chemistry Quality Eurolabels. As of 8 April 2013, 1 Eurodoctorate quality label was awarded. The label is intended for [[third cycle qualification]]s (i.e. [[doctoral degree]]s).&lt;ref name="eudoc"&gt;Mitchell T.N., Varella V.: [http://files.gandi.ws/gandi22757/file/2-doctorate_eurolabel_documentation-150101.pdf Designing European Third Cycle Programmes in Chemistry - "Chemistry Doctorate Eurolabel®"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tuning Chemistry Subject Area Group]] ([[Tuning SAG]]) discussed with a working party of [[ECTN]] ([[European Chemistry Thematic Network]] Association) in a meeting held in February 2006 in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], taking into account the declarations of the [[Bergen Communiqué 2005]]. The [[EHEA Overarching Framework]], which was approved by the Ministers of Education of [[European Union member state]]s in [[Bergen]] uses the [[Dublin descriptors]] and Tuning SAG decided to use the Dublin descriptors to form a new set of descriptors, the [[Budapest descriptor]]s for third cycle qualifications.&lt;ref name="eudoc"/&gt;

The [[Chemistry Eurodoctorate Framework]] version 1 was published in November 2006.

==Awarded labels==
As of 8 April 2013, 60 Eurobachelor, 36 Euromaster, and 1 Eurodoctorate labels have been awarded to 52 institutions and 3 consortia from 20 countries.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;[http://chemistry-eurolabels.gandi.ws/awards List of current Eurolabel holders].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16032">'''Classwide Peer Tutoring''' ('''CWPT''') is a variation of [[peer-mediated instruction]] that has been used in elementary, middle school, and high school classrooms. In CWPT students form pairs and take turns in the roles of tutor and student. Students earn points for their teams by participating in the tutoring and the winning team is recognized. Researchers have investigated CWPT's effectiveness in several different academic areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Classwide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) is a form of [[peer-mediated instruction]] where the teacher creates pairs of students that alternately fill the roles of tutor and student. The tutor asks questions, records points, and provides feedback on whether the student's response matches the correct response designated by the teacher. The student responds orally and/or in writing to the questions and practices the correct answer three times if he or she makes an error.&lt;ref name=Terry&gt;{{cite web|last=Terry|first=Barbara|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.specialconnections.ku.edu/~kucrl/cgi-bin/drupal/?q=instruction/classwide_peer_tutoring|work=University of Kansas Special Connections|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The teacher supervises the tutoring and awards points for good tutoring.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; A classroom's student pairs are divided into two teams, and they earn points for their respective teams by answering questions correctly, correcting their incorrect answers, and tutoring appropriately.&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greenwood|first=Charles|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring|journal=Behavior and Social Issues|year=1997|volume=7|issue=1|page=52-57|doi=10.5210/bsi.v7i1.299}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of a week, the team that has earned the most points is recognized as the winning team.&lt;ref name="Best Evidence Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview: Classwide Peer Tutoring|url=http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/C/classwide.htm|work=Best Evidence Encyclopedia|publisher=Johns Hopkins University School of Education|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; CWPT has been used to help students learn [[spelling]], math facts, basic word reading, reading fluency, [[vocabulary]], and facts related to an area of study.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; There appear to be more published studies of CWPT with positive outcomes in the area of spelling than in other areas. The CWPT technique has been used with several different age levels: pre-school, elementary, middle school, and high school.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT was initially developed and researched in the early 1980s at the Juniper Gardens Children's Project at the [[University of Kansas]].&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Programs that Work: Classwide Peer Tutoring Program|url=http://www.promisingpractices.net/program.asp?programid=99|publisher=Promising Practices Network|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==
The developers of CWPT suggest that this technique provides students more opportunities to practice content or skills, encourages them to engage in [[active learning]], and lets them receive immediate feedback.&lt;ref name=Terry /&gt; CWPT is also thought to provide students with practice using [[social skills]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamps Barbetta Leonard &amp; Delquadri"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamps|first=Debra|author2=Barbetta, Patricia |author3=Leonard, Betsy |author4= Delquadri, Joseph |title=Classwide Peer Tutoring: An Integration Strategy To Improve Reading Skills And Promote Peer Interactions Among Students With Autism And General Education Peers|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|year=1994|volume=27|page=49-61|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-49|pmc=1297776}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evaluation as an evidence-based practice ===
==== What Works Clearinghouse rating ====
The [[United States Department of Education]]'s [[What Works Clearinghouse]] has evaluated CWPT for effectiveness in the areas of General Reading Achievement and [[English language learning and teaching|English Language Learning]] (ELL). These evaluations resulted in a "potentially positive" effectiveness rating in the area of General Reading Achievement for elementary school students, and no rating for ELL due to the fact that no existing studies met What Works Clearinghouse criteria for evaluation.&lt;ref name="WWC reading"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring Beginning Reading|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=81|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWC ELL"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Department of Education|title=Classwide Peer Tutoring English Language Learners|url=http://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/interventionreport.aspx?sid=83|work=What Works Clearinghouse Intervention Report|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; What Works Clearinghouse does not currently provide reports for CWPT's effectiveness in any other areas.

==== Promising Practices Network rating ====
Promising Practices Network considers CWPT a "Proven Program".&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt; The website states that CWPT meets full criteria for a "Proven Program" by having research outcomes that fall in the category of the website's target areas, having at least one outcome that is changed by at least 20% or .25 [[standard deviation]]s, having at least one outcome with a statistically significant and meaningful [[effect size]], having studies that use comparison groups, having studies with sample sizes of 30 or more, and by having research findings publicly available.&lt;ref name="Promising Practices Network" /&gt;

== Criticisms ==
A few studies have shown CWPT to have few advantages over more traditional methods of classroom instruction with middle or high school students, such as teacher-centered instruction or independent practice.&lt;ref name="Allsopp 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Allsopp|first=David|title=Using classwide peer tutoring to teach beginning algebra problem-solving skills in heterogeneous classrooms.|journal=Remedial and Special Education|year=1997|volume=18|issue=6|page=367-379|doi=10.1177/074193259701800606}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowman-Perrott 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman-Perrott|first=Lisa|author2=Greenwood, Charles R |author3=Tapia, Yolanda |title=The efficacy of CWPT used in secondary alternative school classrooms with small teacher/pupil ratios and students with emotional and behavioral disorders.|journal=Education &amp; Treatment of Children|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|page=65-87|doi=10.1353/etc.2007.0014}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have also found that while CWPT may increase the positive social interactions of students with ADHD during the tutoring, it does not necessarily affect their social behavior in other settings.&lt;ref name="Plumer 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plumer|first=Pamela|author2=Stoner, Gary|title=The relative effects of classwide peer tutoring and peer coaching on the positive social behaviors of children with ADHD.|journal=Journal of Attention Disorders|year=2005|volume=9|issue=1|page=290-300|doi=10.1177/1087054705280796}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 October 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Critical Review''''' is a student publication that produces reviews of course offerings at [[Brown University]]. The student group that produces it is also called the '''Critical Review'''. The reviews are written by Brown students from [[course evaluation]] [[questionnaire]]s distributed to class members in the final days of the academic semester. Its purpose is to help students make informed course choices and to help instructors improve [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] techniques by supplementing the information in [http://boca.brown.edu/ The Brown Course Announcement] with real student experiences.

==History==

===The first decade: format and process===
In 1976, just seven years after Brown's "[[Brown University#New curriculum|New Curriculum]]" had been announced, '''''The Other View: A Consumer's Guide to Courses at Brown''''' was started by a group of Brown undergraduates as a publication of the Undergraduate Council of Students. In this annual magazine, students wrote reviews of courses based on responses to both the organization's own questionnaires and also based on departmental questionnaires which were made available by several departments. The written evaluations were short, and the numerical ratings sections, when presented, consisted of only averages. Department Undergraduate Groups were essential to the process because they distributed and collected questionnaires from classes and helped to develop customized questionnaires for their respective departments.

There was no set process for putting the magazine together, and since the questionnaires were different for different classes, the course summaries varied significantly in terms of what information they presented and emphasized. "There must be a better way than having three people slave over questionnaires in the UCS office for two summer months," wrote the editors on the cover page of one of the first editions, "A more rational, uniform process must be developed." Sometime between 1978 and 1981, the name was changed to ''The Critical Review: A Consumer's Guide to Courses at Brown'', and then to simply ''The Critical Review'' a few years later. The number of courses reviewed in each edition varied considerably from year to year. The editors changed the procedure for compiling the magazine annually.  Co-Editors-in-Chief Tom Mashberg '82 and [[Ian Maxtone-Graham]] '82.5 led one such overhaul.

In 1984, recently appointed Editor-in-Chief Rob Markey sought feedback from students and faculty and then overhauled the system in time to create a 1985–1986 Semester I edition, the first issue of the ''Critical Review'' to cover a single semester. The editors introduced the now standard two-reviews-per-page format, with bar graphs, which were meant to depict the general distribution of student responses. The bar graphs were implemented in order to improve the accountability of the Critical Review by balancing the written summaries with objective data from the student surveys and by presenting sample sizes, so that professors would know the reviews were not based on the comments of just one or two students. The editors also created customized software to make it easy to produce the bar graphs. They developed a matching questionnaire to generate the student input on the courses in quantitative form.  However, at this point the Critical Review still relied on professors to distribute its questionnaires, which some refused to do or did haphazardly.  The publication also accepted departmental evaluation forms as an alternative to its own questionnaire.  As a result, bar graphs were not available for many classes.  Nevertheless, having found a satisfactory and manageable system to which Brown students and faculty responded favorably, subsequent editors changed relatively little about the format, process, and policy of the Critical Review over the next few years.

===The early 1990s: refinements===
Mark Popofsky became Editor-in-Chief in 1989 and developed the bar graph system that the Critical Review still uses today. He established new policy for the organization which created lasting precedent: "Because we solely represent student opinion, the Critical Review no longer prints any department-sponsored articles and cannot use departmental evaluations." The editors rewrote the questionnaire and developed new procedure that reduced the time required for the production cycle. As Popofsky wrote, "This issue marks the culmination of what has been a personal crusade of mine for the past year: to publish the ''Critical Review'' in time for preregistration." Later editors said that he inspired them to make every effort to turn the ''Critical Review'' into a more professional-looking book.

In 1991 the Critical Review began to publish "Insights from Student Surveys," which quickly evolved into a regular feature called "Funny Quotes." The level of faculty participation gradually rose from the 1980s to the early 1990s. The Critical Review began using an instructor questionnaire as well in 1992, "in order to gain the perspective of the faculty." A few semesters after switching publishers to the company TCI Press in order to print higher quality magazines, the number of courses reviewed reached a peak of 425 in the 1993–1994 Semester I edition. The Critical Review began using the program [[Adobe PageMaker]] to compose its page layouts at this time, which further improved upon the look of the book.

Despite the efforts and hard work of the editors, the editions of the ''Critical Review'' that were published at this time were not flawless. The accelerated production cycle, combined with limited computing resources available to editors, resulted in a few editions of the magazine that contained significant errors. Some instructors stopped participating in the Critical Review because they saw it as unprofessional or sloppy. The gradual upward trend in the number of courses reviewed per semester came to a halt, and the number of reviews per semester gradually decreased until 1998, at which point it flat lined at about 280 reviews per edition.

===New questionnaire, new purpose===
Christopher Anderson joined the Critical Review around 1993 and rapidly rose through its ranks as the computer consultant. He systematized many aspects of the production process when computing assistance was urgently needed and editors before him and after him identified him as a tremendous help. As editor-in-chief in 1995, he worked with faculty and Critical Review staff to perform a comprehensive analysis and revision of the organization's questionnaires. Despite all the help with the computer aspects that he offered over the years, he identified his new questionnaire as his greatest contribution to the Critical Review.

Rebecca More, Professor of history at Brown and Director of the Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning, was one of the faculty members who worked with Anderson on this project. "Many of the questions still in use today on the form date from that effort," she says. "Our collective goal at that time was to develop questions which would be constructive and help faculty improve their teaching and student learning." Chris Anderson envisioned the Critical Review as more than just a resource for students. He saw it as a constructive feedback service for faculty as well, and worked toward that end by organizing a "teaching forum" for faculty in the spring of 1995. Unfortunately, the frequency with which the Critical Review published errors at this time, to some extent due to understaffing, prevented many instructors from taking a renewed interest. Nevertheless, Anderson's new questionnaire was used from 1996 to 2001, at which point it was further modified with the help of faculty.

===Web site and budget cuts===
Even as early as 1993, the editors of the Critical Review recognized that the organization should eventually establish a web-based resource. As they wrote, "The goal of putting together an on-line CR connected to the Brown On-line Course Announcement (BOCA) should be discussed." In 1997, the organization finally achieved that goal, thanks to its first website architect, David Tom '98. There was only marginal interest in the Critical Review's website during its first year of existence, however, as printed copies were still available for all undergraduates.

Just as the website was constructed, the Undergraduate Finance Board decided to slice the Critical Review's annual budget from $25,890 to $11,490, the largest budget cut for any single student group that year. Facing a funding decrease themselves of more than $100,000 because of their reliance on diminishing holding funds, UFB deliberately targeted the Critical Review in order to eliminate its printed form.

The Critical Review editors were devastated by this decision. Evan Snyder '00 served as editor-in-chief for the next edition, and he outlined his case for the importance of a printed form of the Critical Review in it. He argued that with just an online format, the Critical Review would not be able to attract as many writers, students and faculty would have more limited access to it, readers would no longer be able to browse it leisurely, and thus it would be "virtually impossible" for readers to discover great courses inadvertently. He added, "In our hyper-frantic rush to produce this book from scratch in a three-week period, the last thing we wanted to be doing was fighting for our existence. And yet this is precisely what circumstances dictate we do." The editors said that faculty would probably have to pay for their own copies from then on, and that they would no longer be able to produce enough copies for every undergraduate.

The Undergraduate Finance Board eventually returned most of the funding that it had taken away. After Evan Snyder graduated in 2000, however, UFB cut the Critical Review's printing budget again, and made the cut effective immediately. With the reduced budget, the circulation of the next edition was 2500 copies, down from 5500 copies three years earlier. In this edition, the editors again presented their argument for the importance of printed copies. "We asked each student who filled out a [questionnaire] to tell us whether she believed that the hard copy of The Critical Review should continue to exist, and the reply was 'yes' in overwhelming numbers [...]. But sadly, this view has not been that of those with the most financial control over the publication."

===Raising standards===
Interest in the organization rose after 2001, as the number of courses reviewed per semester gradually increased. The number of Critical Review staff members nearly tripled from 2001 to 2004, to the point that for the first time in its history, the Critical Review was able to introduce an application process to become a writer. The organization's website also underwent major revisions from 2002 to 2004, and at the beginning of the spring 2005 semester, thousands of students visited it each day.  Students and instructors from other universities, including [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]], [[Boston University]], [[Clark University]], and the [[University of Rhode Island]], began to contact the Critical Review for advice about how to set up equivalent services at their respective schools.

In a 2004 independent study to examine ways that the organization and service could be improved, co-Editor-in-Chief Nicholas Schade '05 studied available research on student ratings of instruction and sought suggestions from [[social research|survey methodology]] experts.  He also contacted Critical Review alumni, interviewed several Brown professors, and surveyed hundreds of students to compile a "Report on the Critical Review."  Among other things, this document brought to light concerns about the overall goals of the organization, institutional memory, faculty and student perceptions, and persistent internal difficulties.  Partly in response to these issues, the editors hosted a "Faculty Forum" in December 2004 to seek suggestions and feedback from instructors about Critical Review policy and the questionnaires themselves. Some professors who had not participated in the Critical Review for years began to participate again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.browndailyherald.com/2006/03/14/critical-review-labors-against-critical-problems |title= Critical Review labors against critical problems |first= Chelsea |last= Rudman |date= March 14, 2006 |newspaper= [[The Brown Daily Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors formally rejected the perception that the publication is a service to only the student body by ratifying a group constitution in February 2005, outlining the objectives of the organization with regard to serving both students and faculty of Brown in a professional manner.  Schade supplemented his report with other documents to produce a Critical Review "Chief Editor's Resource" in April 2005 so that these records could be further augmented, edited, and passed on to future editorial teams.

Meanwhile, funding remained a major concern as the editors tried repeatedly to convince the Undergraduate Finance Board that the Critical Review must remain in print form. There were some gains, but after 2002, the Critical Review's budget increased only marginally.  In 2007, despite the efforts of Editors-in-Chief Ariana Cannavo '08 and Dara Steinberg '09, UFB eliminated the entire printing budget, instructing the ''Critical Review'' to be a web-only publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.browndailyherald.com/2007/10/02/amid-budget-cuts-critical-review-loses-print-edition |title= Amid budget cuts, Critical Review loses print edition  |first= Anna |last= Millman |date= October 2, 2007 |newspaper= [[The Brown Daily Herald]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, the organization has published course evaluations on its web page only.

==Staffing==
The names of the positions within the Critical Review have changed over the years, but since at least 1994, the overall structure of the staffing and [[hierarchy]] within the group have not varied significantly. All phases of the production are handled by student volunteers. The tabulation and writing of the review capsules is performed by a team of Writers. Those who demonstrate strong commitment to the group and whose work is of high quality may be promoted to the position of Editor. In addition to assisting groups of Writers, Editors also handle all final editing of the reviews and create the actual page layouts that are combined and sent to the publisher to form the magazine. One or more [[Editor-in-Chief|Editors-in-Chief]] oversee the whole writing and publication process.

{{DanishEducation}}

The '''folkeskole''' ({{lang-en|primary school}}) is a type of [[school]] in [[Denmark]] covering the entire period of compulsory education, from the age of 6 to 16, encompassing [[pre-school]], [[Primary education|primary]] and lower [[secondary education]].&lt;ref name="folkeskoleloven"&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/forms/r0710.aspx?id=133039#K2 Folkeskoleloven]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical overview ==

Legend has it that [[Ansgar]], a [[France|French]] [[Benedictine]] [[monk]], was the first [[missionary]] to visit Denmark around 822, purchased the freedom of twelve male [[thrall]]s and educated them in the first school in Denmark, at [[Hedeby]] in [[Schleswig]]. This was the forerunner of the religious houses which sprang forth over the entire country from about 1100 onwards. In their [[cloisters]], boys from surrounding villages — and occasionally girls as well — received elementary instruction in the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and in [[dogma]].

However, quite early trade and crafts demanded more practical schools. The primitive writing-and-counting schools had their origins here, usually with very mediocre teachers, but they were very useful and therefore they flourished, maintained by private support and by the guilds.

=== Reformation ===

The [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] came to Denmark from [[Germany]] in 1536. As in Germany, [[Protestants]] quickly broke up the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school system. The religious houses were closed and the vast estates of the Roman Catholic Church taken over by the Crown. This meant that the state also took over such tasks as [[education]].

The [[Church Law of 1539]] contains Denmark's first educational legislation with a formal requirement for schools in all provincial boroughs. While new [[grammar school]]s sprang up, laying the foundation of classical humanism among the higher strata of society, the broad masses had to be content with the old Danish schools or writing schools which provided a primitive form of instruction.

A substantial stride was taken in the direction of popular education in 1721, when [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederick IV]] established 240 schoolhouses bearing the royal insignia and called them Cavalry schools after a division of the country into military districts. At the same time, the new religious movement of [[Pietism]] was spreading from Germany to Denmark. It aroused among church people a sense of responsibility towards forthcoming generations and enjoyed royal support. A series of calls by the church for universal confirmation which could only be met by some degree of [[literacy]], brought many new schools into existence. Thus, a limited kind of compulsory education was formally introduced.

However, it was the 'philanthropic' movement, a very active current of educational thought inspired by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] in the second half of the 18th century, that first succeeded in creating a real school for ordinary people, open to all children.

Planned training of [[teacher]]s developed in parsonages and state training colleges, and two [[Education Act of 1814|Education Acts]] were enacted in 1814, introducing better municipal primary schools and independent schools for children in rural areas all over Denmark.

=== Grundtvig ===

When a prolonged agricultural crisis and economic slump after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] threatened to cripple the entire educational reform programme, the government had to resort to a distressingly mechanical method of education, the so-called [[Bell-Lancaster method]] imported from the industrial north of [[England]], which reduced the number of teachers by a drastic simplification of the curriculum to enable preposterously large numbers of pupils to be taught by a single individual. After some years, this method provoked increasing opposition from parents, who wanted more liberal and inspiring forms of education. Their demands received vigorous support from the poet-clergyman [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]], who exercised a powerful influence on the development of Danish schools. Grundtvig wanted to reduce the task of children's schools to no more than the teaching of reading, writing and arithmetic in order to make room, either at home or at school, for a liberal narrative education that would build on the natural potential for development inherent in the child's mind.

Grundtvig's ideas were translated into practice by [[Christen Mikkelsen Kold|Christen Kold]], who created a distinctively Danish parent-controlled school known as the free school as an alternative to state-sponsored education, exercising a growing influence over the latter's mode of functioning.

The [[Education Act of 1894]] improved teacher training in several important respects.  As Danish [[agriculture]] continued to modernise and Danish society continued to [[urbanisation|urbanise]], new Education Acts were brought forth around 1900, which changed the Danish basic school by expanding its curriculum. A four-year middle school for students over 11 years of age was established in 1903 to form a bridge between the folkeskole and the realskole (lower secondary school) and the [[Gymnasium (Denmark)|gymnasium]]. The middle schools rapidly attained great popularity, and over the next half-century, large numbers of children and young people used them as a stepping stone to upper secondary education.

The strong attraction to the upper classes to the folkeskole gradually weakened. Since the conception of the [[welfare state]] was intensifying the demand for [[social equality]] and [[democracy|democratisation]], middle schools were reorganised in 1958 to include two academic paths: a 3-year academically oriented real department and the 8th-10th forms.

=== Modern form ===

New acts in [[Act of the folkeskole of 1937|1937]], [[Act of the Folkeskole of 1958|1958]], and [[Act of the Folkeskole of 1975|1975]] reflected the demands of a new age in terms of equal access to all forms of education. The act of 1975 abolished the real-department and introduced two completely new examinations: the [[Exit Examination of the Folkeskole]] and the [[Advanced Exit Examination of the Folkeskole]] held on a single-subject basis.

A new [[Act of the Folkeskole of 1990|act]] in 1990 introduced new provisions regarding the administration of the schools with more managerial competence vested in the headteacher and the setting up of school boards with large parental representation.  Finally, another [[Act of the Folkeskole of 1994|act]] that came into force in 1994 stiuplated that the folkeskole give a student the opportunity to develop as many of their talents as possible. One of the watchwords of the new act is [[differentiated teaching]], or that teaching should be adapted as much as possible to the individual student.

== Types of institutions ==
There are different ways of meeting the rules pertaining to compulsory education: by attending the municipal folkeskole, a private school, by home tuition, or as far as the last 2–3 years of the basic school are concerned by attending one of the alternative school forms: [[Continuation school|the efterskole]], or the youth schools.

=== Municipal folkeskole ===
Municipal folkeskoles have about 88% of all pupils of compulsory school age. They provide basic education free of charge to children between the ages of 7 and 16, or through the voluntary pre-school, the 9 years of compulsory education, to the voluntary 10th year.

There are three different types of Folkeskoles, those with a pre-school and 1st-10th form levels, those with a pre-school and 1st-7th form levels, and those with only three or more consecutive form levels.  The latter may be placed under the management of another school, unless the enrollment is more than 100.

Compulsory education can thus not be met fully in the second or third type of schools, and students in such school have to switch schools after the 7th form. The first type of school is common in areas with large pupil-basis, whereas more thinly populated [[Municipalities of Denmark|municipalities]] may have a number of the second and third type school and only one or two of the first type.  The smallest school has six students and the largest 892, with the average school containing 320 pupils (1999).

==== Admission requirements ====
Any child resident in Denmark is subject to 10 years of compulsory education from the age of 6 to 16.&lt;ref name="folkeskoleloven" /&gt; The first year is pre-school, referred to as kindergarten class or 0th form. An additional non-compulsory 10th form is offered at many schools. Children who are to live in Denmark for a minimum of 6 months are subject to the regulations on compulsory education. Compulsory education means an obligation to participate in the teaching of the folkeskole or in a teaching which is comparable to what is usually required in the folkeskole.

Compulsory education commences on 1 August of the calendar year of the child's 6th birthday, and it terminates on 31 July, when the child has received regular instruction for 10 years. At the request of the parents or with their consent, a child's education may be postponed to one year after the normal commencement of compulsory education, when such a step is justified by the child's development. A child may also — at the request of their parents, and if they are considered able to follow the instruction — be admitted before their 6th birthday.

=== Private schools ===
As of 2013, Private, or free elementary, schools cater to 15.6% of students in 2004/05 of basic school age.,&lt;ref name=klassekampen&gt;Line Madsen Simenstad (2 December 2013) [http://www.klassekampen.no/article/20131202/ARTICLE/131209996 Bølge av private skoler] ''[[Klassekampen]]''. Retrieved 6 December 2013 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; having risen from 12.9% of students in 2004/05.

In the spring of 1991, the [[Danish Parliament]] adopted a new private school act, which introduced a new public grant system for private schools giving them a grant towards the operational expenditures per pupil per year, which in principle matches the corresponding public expenditures in the municipal schools - less the fees paid by the parents of the pupils in the private schools.

In 1999, the average grant towards the operational expenditures per pupil per year amounted to [[Danish krone|DKK]] 34,134 (US$5,500) and the average fees paid by the parents amounted to DKK 6,942 (US$1,100).

Private schools can be roughly divided into the following categories:

* Small "Grundtvigian" independent schools in rural districts.
* [[Religion|Religious]] or congregational schools, such as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] or Danish mission schools
* Progressive free schools
* [[International school|International Schools]] such as [[Copenhagen International School]]
* Schools with a particular pedagogical objective, such as the [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] schools
* [[Germany|German]] minority schools
* [[Immigrant]] schools such as [[Muslim]] schools

Private schools are recognised and receive government financing regardless of the ideological, religious, political, or ethnic motivation behind their establishment. Some private schools are very old, some quite new, and new ones are added all the time. It is characteristic of the private schools that they are smaller than municipal schools.

All that is demanded of private schools is that their teaching equal that of the municipal schools. The [[Ministry of Education (Denmark)|Ministry of Education]] confers on private schools the right to use the final examinations of the folkeskole, thereby exercising a certain extent of quality control. In principle, however, it is not up to any government authority but to the parents of each private school to check that its performance measures up to the demands set for the municipal schools.

The parents must themselves choose a supervisor to check the pupils' level of achievement in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[arithmetic]], [[mathematics]], and [[English language|English]]. If the school is found inadequate, the supervisor must report it to the municipal school authority. In extraordinary circumstances, the Ministry of Education may establish special supervision, for example if there is reason to believe that the school teaches a subject so poorly that it may give the pupils problems later on in life.

Educational experts say the rise in use of private schools in the 2000s is partly due to white Danish families putting their children in private schools when the neighbouring public school gets more than 30% pupils of immigrant background. About 24% of pupils grade 1-3 in Copenhagen attend private schools. Another factor is parents in small communities who have organized to start a private school when small public schools have closed as a results of the Danish municipality reform which led to fewer municipalities.&lt;ref name=klassekampen/&gt;

=== Levels and age groups ===
The folkeskole consists of an obligatory pre-school class, the 9-year obligatory course and a voluntary 11th year and a year in the beginning. It thus caters for pupils aged 6 to 17.

The comprehensive concept of the folkeskole enables students to remain in the same student group with the same classmates from the 1st to the 10th (or 11th) form, sharing the same experiences in all subjects with peers of all types of backgrounds and covering the whole range of ability.

The new act, which came into effect for the school year 1994-95, has abolished the division of the subjects of [[arithmetic]], [[mathematics]], [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[physics]], and [[chemistry]] into basic and advanced level courses in the 8th to 10th forms, introducing a system of differentiated teaching, by which the teachers have to adapt their teaching to the prerequisites of the individual pupil.

=== General objectives ===
Section 1 of the [[Act of the Folkeskole of 1994]] states that:

"The folkeskole shall — in co-operation with the parents — further the pupils' acquisition of knowledge, skills, working methods and ways of expressing themselves and thus contribute to the all-round personal development of the individual pupil.

"The folkeskole shall endeavour to create such opportunities for experience, industry and absorption that the pupils develop awareness, imagination and an urge to learn, so that they acquire confidence in their own possibilities and a background for forming independent judgements and for taking personal action.

"The folkeskole shall familiarise the pupils with Danish culture and contribute to their understanding of other cultures and of man's interaction with nature. The school shall prepare the pupils for active participation, joint responsibility, rights and duties in a society based on freedom and democracy. The teaching of the school and its daily life must therefore build on intellectual freedom, equality and democracy."

== Subjects of the folkeskole ==
The subjects taught in the folkeskole can be divided into obligatory subjects and topics offered throughout the entire period of the folkeskole and optional subjects and topics offered in the 8th to 10th year of the folkeskole.

=== Mandatory subjects ===
The teaching in the nine-year basic school covers the following subjects which are compulsory for all pupils:

[[Danish language|Danish]], [[Christian]] studies — including in the oldest forms instruction in foreign religions and other philosophies of life, PE and sport, and [[mathematics]] during the entire 9-year period; [[English language|English]] and [[history]] from the 3rd to the 9th year; [[music]] from the 1st to the 6th year; [[science]] from the 1st to the 6th year; [[art]] from the 1st to the 5th year; [[social studies]] from the 8th to the 9th year; [[geography]] and [[biology]] from the 7th to the 9th year; [[physics]] and [[chemistry]] in the 7th to 9th year; [[needlework]], [[wood]]- or [[metal]]work and [[cooking]] for one or more years between the 4th and 7th year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/r0710.aspx?id=145631#Kap2 |title = Folkeskoleloven - Bekendtgørelse af lov om folkeskolen - retsinformation.dk |last = |first = |publisher = retsinformation.dk |date = 29 May 2013 |website = retsinformation.dk |accessdate= 27 July 2013 | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The instruction in the basic school furthermore comprises the following obligatory topics: traffic safety, [[health education|health]] and [[sex education]] and [[family planning]] as well as educational, vocational and labour market orientation.

=== Optional subjects ===
The second foreign language, [[German language|German]] or [[French language|French]], must be offered in the 7th to 10th year.

The following optional subjects and topics may be offered to the pupils in the 8th to 10th year: French or German as a third foreign language, [[word processing]], [[technology]], [[Mass media|media]], [[art]], [[photography]], [[film]], [[drama]], [[music]], [[needlework]], [[wood]]- or [[metal]]work, [[home economics]], [[engine|engine knowledge]], other workshop subjects, and vocational studies. Furthermore, [[Latin]] may be offered to the pupils in the 10th year.

The teaching in the 10th form comprises the following subjects as obligatory subjects: [[Danish language|Danish]], [[mathematics]], and [[English language|English]] to an extent corresponding to a total of 14 lessons a week (i.e. half of the minimum weekly teaching time). Instruction must be offered in PE and sport, Christian studies and religious education, social studies and physics or chemistry. Furthermore, pupils who have chosen German or French as second foreign language in the 7th to 9th years must be offered continued instruction in that subject in the 10th year.

The pupils in the 8th to 10th year must choose at least one optional subject.

===Subjects===
So all in all the subjects are: [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Religion studies]], [[mathematics]], [[Art]], [[History]], [[Music]], [[Physical education|PE]], [[English language|English]] and [[Science]]. These are all the basic classes, and then there are the later classes: [[Home economics]], [[Chemistry]], [[Social studies]], [[needlework]], [[Wood Work]], [[Physics]], [[Geography]] and [[Biology]].

== Pupil evaluation ==
There are two ways of carrying out evaluation in the folkeskole: continuous evaluation and the evaluation made at examinations.

=== Continuous evaluation ===
The student's benefit from the teaching is being evaluated on a continuous basis. This evaluation forms the basis of the guidance of the individual pupil with a view to the further planning of the teaching.

In addition to the basic skills, the folkeskole is required by law to help promote the personal and social development of each individual student according to their capability. Working methods are modified towards the pupil's attainment of greater self-reliance and maturity. This aspect of pedagogic policy requires close co-operation between school and home, and an ongoing dialogue is sought between teachers, parents and pupils.

The act is very clear on this point, requiring that pupils and parents be regularly informed of the school's opinion about how each student is profiting from their schooling. In this case, regularly means at least twice a year and refers explicitly to information as to the student's personal and social development as well as his purely academic attainment.

In the 1st to 8th year, information is given either in writing or, which is more common, as part of the conversational exchanges between all three parties: pupil, parents and class teacher - which are a regular feature of Danish school life.

In the 9th to 11th year, the information system is increased to include a written report at least twice a year giving the pupil's standpoint in academic achievement and in application. For pupils at this level, the evaluation of the level of attainment in the individual subjects is expressed in marks.

Marks are given according to the 7-point marking scale indicating the performance of the pupil:

* 12: For an excellent performance
* 10: For a very good performance
* 7: For a good performance
* 4: For a fair performance
* 02: For an adequate performance
* 00: For an inadequate performance
* -3: For an unacceptable performance

The last such marks are given immediately before the written examinations and express the pupils' proficiency in the subject at that particular time.

The marking scale was changed April 2007 (order by Danish ministry of Education,  Order no. 262 of 20 March 2007), to be comparable to the [[ECTS grading scale]]:

* The grade 12 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an A on the ECTS scale
* The grade 10 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to a B on the ECTS scale
* The grade 7 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to a C on the ECTS scale
* The grade 4 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to a D on the ECTS scale
* The grade 02 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an E on the ECTS scale
* The grade 00 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an Fx on the ECTS scale
* The grade -3 on the 7-point grading scale corresponds to an F on the ECTS scale

=== Examinations ===
Examinations are held at two levels: The leaving examination after the 10th and 11th year and the 11th form examination. Standard rules have been developed for all the examinations with a view to ensuring uniformity throughout the country. For the same reason, the written examination questions are set and marked at central level.  Examinations are not compulsory. The pupils decide whether or not to sit for examinations in a subject upon consultation with the school, or in practice, their own teachers and their parents. But, in general 90- 95% write the leaving examination after the 10th year of the folkeskole and 85-90% write the leaving examination after the 11th year.

'''[[Education]] in [[Azerbaijan]]''' is regulated by the [[Ministry of Education (Azerbaijan)|Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan]].

==History==
In the pre-Soviet period, Azerbaijani education included intensive [[Islamic]] religious training that commenced in early childhood. Beginning at roughly age five and sometimes continuing until age twenty, children attended [[madrasahs]], education institutions affiliated with [[mosques]]. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, madrasahs were established as separate education institutions in major cities, but the religious component of education remained significant. In 1865 the first technical high school and the first women's high school were opened in [[Baku]]. In the late nineteenth century, secular elementary schools for Azerbaijanis began to appear (schools for ethnic Russians had been established earlier), but institutions of higher education and the use of the [[Azerbaijani language]] in secondary schools were forbidden in Transcaucasia throughout the tsarist period. The majority of ethnic Azerbaijani children received no education in this period, and the Azerbaijani [[literacy rate]] remained very low, especially among women. Few women were allowed to attend school.

In the Soviet era, literacy and average education levels rose dramatically from their very low starting point, despite two changes in the script, from [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] to [[Latin script|Latin]] in the 1920s and from Latin to [[Cyrillic]] in the 1930s. According to Soviet data, 100 percent of males and females (ages nine to forty-nine) were literate in 1970. According to the [[United Nations Development Program]] Report 2009, the literacy rate in Azerbaijan is 99.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Human Development Report 2009 | publisher = United Nations Development Program 2009| url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2009_EN_Complete.pdf| accessdate = August 23, 2017|date=2009|format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Soviet period, the Azerbaijani education system was based on the standard model imposed by [[Moscow]], which featured state control of all education institutions and heavy doses of Marxist–Leninist ideology at all levels.

Since independence, one of the first laws that Azerbaijan's Parliament passed was to adopt a [[Azerbaijani alphabet|modified-Latin alphabet]] to replace Cyrillic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Education in Azerbaijan, The Challenges of Transition | publisher = Azerbaijan International| url = http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/44_folder/44_articles/44_education.html| accessdate = August 23, 2017|date=Winter 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other than that the Azerbaijani system has undergone little structural change. Initial alterations have included the reestablishment of religious education (banned during the Soviet period) and curriculum changes that have reemphasized the use of the Azerbaijani language and have eliminated ideological content. In addition to elementary schools, the education institutions include thousands of [[preschool]]s, general [[secondary schools]], and [[vocational schools]], including specialized secondary schools and technical schools. Education through the ninth grade is compulsory. At the end of the Soviet period, about 18 percent of instruction was in [[Russian language|Russian]], but the use of Russian began a steady decline beginning in 1988. Today [[English language|English]] and Russian are taught as second or third languages.

== Education system in the Republic of Azerbaijan ==
Education in Azerbaijan is regarded as an area of activity that constitutes the basis for the development of the society and the state, which has a strategic precaution and superiority. In the Republic of Azerbaijan, the educational system has a democratic, secular character and its basis is national and international values. All citizens are entitled to 9 years of compulsory general education.
The right to education is the fundamental right of citizens of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This was established in the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan and in the Education Law of the Republic of Azerbaijan.

Article 42 of the Constitution of the Republic of Azerbaijan states that the right of citizens to be educated is determined as follows:
* Every citizen has the right to education;
* The state grants free compulsory general secondary education;
* The state controls the education system;
* The State guarantees the education of talented persons without regard to their material condition;
* The government sets minimum educational standards;
* Everyone has the right to education in the framework of the state standard; 
* It is guaranteed that all citizens have the right to education in Azerbaijan irrespective of differences such as nationality, religion, race, language, sex, age, health and social status, activity area, place of residence and political views.
Education is free and compulsory for children between the ages of six and fifteen. Basic schooling is divided into three: primary education, general secondary and full secondary education.

===Language===
[[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]] is the main language of education in the schools of the Republic of Azerbaijan and Azerbaijani is the official language of the country. There are, however, many schools who offer the whole 9 years of general education, 3 years of higher education and bachelor's degree in Russian. The languages offered is not limited to Russian only: there are branches of well-known schools and foundations e.g. British School, EF English First which offer the English language based education for both foreigners and expats in the country and the local people, for 9–11 years of the general education, although majority of these schools have higher than average tuition costs in comparison with the local educational establishments mainly due to being private organizations and schools.

For bachelor's degree, the choice gets wider: the three major languages ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[English language|English]]) as a medium of instruction are still there, however, for those who plan to take regional studies courses the classes are offered in languages corresponding to their study of country e.g. [[Japanese studies]] and culture students must take [[Japanese language]] course without exception for some classes, summer schools and internships may require higher knowledge of the language.

Undergraduate courses are tended to be taught in English, especially at newly founded or popular universities e.g. [[ADA University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ada.edu.az/en-US/Pages/home.aspx|title=ADA|website=www.ada.edu.az|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baku Higher Oil School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bhos.edu.az/az/index|title=BANM - Bakı Ali Neft Məktəbi|website=www.bhos.edu.az|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baku Engineering University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beu.edu.az/|title=Baku Engineering University|website=beu.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (former [[Qafqaz University]]). Along with this, traditional and old universities e.g. [[Baku State University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages]] and other establishments offer not only arts and humanities but also social science courses mainly in English.

== Pillars of Education ==

=== Primary Education ===
Primary education starts with one year of pre-primary school training. Before pre-school training majority of children already know the basics of understanding from their kindergarten experience. So pre-school training is mainly to develop kids' comprehension, nature, taste and understanding of surrounding elements. Some children acquire writing and reading skills during this period as well, however, it differs from child to child and their skills mainly.

Primary school itself starts at the age of six and lasts four years, 1-4 classes.&lt;ref name="Azerbaijan Education System"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classbase.com/countries/Azerbaijan/Education-System|title=Azerbaijan Education System|website=www.classbase.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 10 students take an exam and pass to what is called in the western system "middle school". The majority of the population attend public schools for primary education, however, there are many private schools to choose and attend too.

=== General Secondary Education ===
This stage of education is equal to the western system of middle school and covers 5-9th grades.&lt;ref name="Azerbaijan Education System"/&gt; General secondary education is also free in public schools. In this period students get deeper knowledge about literature, math, languages, history, culture, sports, science, arts etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beic.az/education_azerbaijan.html|title=Education System in Azerbaijan - Baku Education Information Center|website=www.beic.az|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of general secondary education, they take an exam to get the full secondary education.

=== Full Secondary Education ===
Full secondary education covers 10th, and 11th grades and is also free in public schools Azerbaijan offers. At this stage students already choose their choice of future profession and prepare for entrance exams that take place every year in summer. This is considered to be the most vulnerable period of studentship mainly due to the stress level caused by the entrance exam competition to score higher and to get full scholarships from the government to pay for their tuition fees among students.

== Entrance exam ==
Entrance exam is the official governmental exam entrants take to get into universities every summer in different regions of Azerbaijan. It used to be free till 2017, however, students who want to take entrance exams now have to pay 40₼ ($23.5 as of May 5, 2017). Evaluation is based on the higher the better system: maximum score is 700. Students are required to answer 25 questions from each subject according to the path they are going, making it overall 5 subjects for each profession group. There are overall 4 main groups of profession and one extra (5th group) for those who plan to attend vocational schools. The government exempts those who score higher from tuition fees.

== Diplomas and Certificates ==
Graduates who have completed their education and have successfully completed the examinations and diplomas are presented with a uniform state document certifying their profession and their degree. The training document is the basis for starting work and moving to the new step. Documents related to the education presented are cercertificate scholarship, diploma, professional master diploma, diploma, bachelor's, master's and doctoral diploma over the "junior expert" category, certificate for increasing specialization, diploma related to re-training.

The government of Azerbaijan provides all public schools with the necessary textbooks all free of charge. Medium of instruction is Azerbaijani, however, due to Soviet influence,here are still a lot of public schools offering Russian as a medium of instruction.

=== Private Schools ===
There is a wide choice for both expats and locals if they would like their children to attend private schools: Turkish lyceums and international schools are the most opt among all private institutions. Turkish lyceums have been the most favored private schools since Azerbaijan gained independence in 1991, however, recently due to some organizational issues the number of Turkish lyceums has decreased significantly or they operate under different names. There are, however, still a lot of Turkish schools operating in Baku and the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azerbaijans.com/content_877_en.html|title=Azərbaycan :: Baş səhifə|website=www.azerbaijans.com|language=az|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, due to language barriers, expats are not able to benefit from public schools Azerbaijan offers. However, there is a wide choice of the branches of international schools that can be attended in Baku and the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.expat-quotes.com/guides/azerbaijan/education/international-schools-in-azerbaijan.htm|title=International Schools in Azerbaijan, Education, Azerbaijan {{!}} Expat-Quotes|website=www.expat-quotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vocational Schools ===
Vocational schools can start from the 9th and 11th grade and last three to four years. These schools teach skills to students.

==Universities==
[[File:Azercellroom3.jpg|thumb|E-Learning Room at [[Khazar University]].]]
There are 38 state-run and 11 private universities in Azerbaijan. The ministry-released reports state that in 2016, [http://tqdk.gov.az/news/bachelor/2532/ 34224 students entered the universities]. Universities employ 11,566 professors and 12,616 faculty members in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tehsil.gov.az/view.php?lang=az&amp;menu=300&amp;id=1444 |title= Alı Və Orta İxtısas Təhsılı Sahəsı Üzrə 2009-CU İldə Görülmüş İşlərə Daİr Hesabat |trans-title= Report on Works in Secondary and Higher Education Sector in 2009 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Azerbaijani culture has always included great respect for secular learning, the country traditionally has been an education center for the Muslim peoples of the former [[Soviet Union]]. For that reason and because of the role of the oil industry in Azerbaijan's economy, a relatively high percentage of Azerbaijanis have obtained some form of higher education, most notably in scientific and technical subjects.&lt;ref name="AZ study"&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: A Country Study, Education, Health, and Welfare | publisher = Country Studies| url = http://countrystudies.us/azerbaijan/23.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several vocational institutes train technicians for the oil industry and other primary industries.

The most popular institutions of higher education are the [[Baku State University]], [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]] (ASOA), [[Baku Higher Oil School]] , [[Baku Engineering University]], (former [[Qafqaz University]]), [[Khazar University]], [[Azerbaijan Tourism and Management University]], [[Azerbaijan Technical University]], [[Azerbaijan State Pedagogical University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages|Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzade Pedagogical Institute for Languages]], [[Azerbaijan Medical University]], [[Baku Academy of Music|Uzeyir Hajibayov Baku Academy of Music]]. Much scientific research, which during the Soviet period dealt mainly with enhancing oil production and refining, is carried out by [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], which was established in 1945.

Baku State University (the University of Azerbaijan, established in 1919) includes more than a dozen departments, ranging from physics to Oriental studies, and has the largest library in Azerbaijan. The student population numbers more than 11,000, and the faculty over 600. The Institute of Petroleum and Chemistry, established in 1920, has more than 15,000 students and a faculty of about 1,000. The institute trains engineers and scientists in the [[petrochemical industry]], [[geology]], and related areas.

== Educational reforms ==
Since gaining independence, [[Azerbaijan]] has worked on the restoration, improvement and development of general education. A number of programmes and projects have been implemented to make educational reforms. In this regard, a joint project was planned with the [[World Bank]] - Second Education Sector Development Project (2009-2016) which includes supporting the implementation of the general education [[curriculum]] and further curriculum reforms to successfully engage teachers, students, and education managers in the realization of the new general education curriculum, and to develop new learning materials and school libraries, modernizing in-service teacher training to support the education reform, building on the institutional framework supported by APL 1, using student assessment for education quality improvement to build up a new evaluation and assessment culture in Azerbaijan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.worldbank.org/P102117/second-education-sector-development-project?lang=en|title=Projects: Second Education Sector Development Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to allow the schools to select and order the books that they need, 1200 issues of the catalogue of available learning and reading materials were printed and sent to 500 schools. 31 organizations provided the 452 titles of books totaling 549000 issues. They are being delivered to 500 school libraries in accordance with the submitted orders. In addition, catalogue covers yearly cards (total 784 cards for “[[Azerbaijani language]]”, “[[Computer science]]s”, “[[Mathematics]]”, “[[Life skills-based education|Life skill]]” subjects) for fee-based website www.e-tehsil.com which were delivered to 196 general schools having access to [[internet]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/about/annualreport/files/Azerbaijan_2015_COAR.pdf|title=UNICEF Annual Report 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of reforms under SESDP, 14 enlightening commercial films were prepared and broadcast on “[[İctimai Television|Ictimai]]” TV. The ongoing reforms were discussed in most releases of Open Lesson talk show.

UNICEF’s support to Azerbaijan in the implementation of educational reforms was reflected in a UNICEF’s annual report on Azerbaijan (2015). According to the report, UNICEF assisted the Azerbaijani government to launch the first inclusive school.  Professionals and teachers were trained on a model of special education. In this manner, the German model of [[Inclusion (education)|inclusive education]] was started to be applied in accordance with the offer of the UNICEF.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

This institute supported the implementation of strategy on developing the teaching capacity of primary teachers from 352 schools. In 2015, the government launched structural reforms to efficiently involve children with disabilities in education.

A five-year plan was made to establish an education system meeting education and development needs of all children.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edu.gov.az/az/page/9/13440|title=Azərbaycan Respublikası Təhsil Nazirliyi|website=edu.gov.az|language=az|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bologna Process ==
The Bologna Process which has been created by the European Higher Education Area under the Lisbon Recognition Convention is based on cooperation between public authorities, universities, teachers, students and staff from 46 countries.

Azerbaijan is a full member of the Bologna Process/European higher education area since 2005. Joining to the Bologna process Azerbaijan began education reforms in order to get higher education meeting the common European standards. In 2005 Action Plan covering the period 2006-2010 was approved for the implementation of the Bologna Declaration. The process began to be implemented on the certain specialties in several higher educational institutions since 2006. But now the process is implemented in all higher education institutions in Azerbaijan.

The main requirement of the Bologna Process is to organize educational process in accordance with the European credit transfer system. This system also allows students to continue their education at other institutions of higher learning, and thus allows students to increase competitiveness on a labor market.

In order to accelerate the integration of the higher education system in the European Space of the Higher Education, ensure mutual recognition of diplomas, and developments of student's and teaching mobility, the Cabinet of Ministries of Azerbaijan approved a resolution dated December 24, 2013, No348 on "Rules of the organization of educating on credit system at levels of a bachelor degree and a magistracy of higher educational institutions".
 
According to the rules, students are not excluded from the university for Academic failure. If the student does not collect the required number of credits through its specialty for a specific period of time, then in subsequent years to collecting these loans it makes no annual fee.

At an assessment of knowledge of students, the minimum acceptable indicator of the points gained at examination is 17 points, as a whole by a subject of 51 points.

As a result of the reforms which have been carried out in the field of higher education, all higher educational institutions received a financial autonomy.

On July 3–4, 2013 an international conference organized by the Azerbaijan Student Youth Organizations' Union (ASYOU) on “Bologna process and Azerbaijan” was held in Baku. The conference that was attended by the delegations from Lithuania, Serbia, Ukraine Luxemburg and Belgium, focused on Azerbaijan`s achievements in educational system and prospects for further development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edu.gov.az/en/page/83/2552|title=Ministry of Education of Azerbaijan|website=edu.gov.az}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biweekly.ada.edu.az/vol_1_no_20/Integrating_Azerbaijan_higher_educational_system_into_European_higher_education_area.htm|title=Integrating Azerbaijan’s higher educational system into European higher education area: Accomplishments, challenges and future prospects - Biweekly|website=biweekly.ada.edu.az}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[Haley Kilpatrick]] founded Girl Talk at [[Deerfield-Windsor School]] in Albany, GA, in the fall of 2002 because of her own middle school experiences.  Kilpatrick had a hard time adjusting in middle school and often felt left out.&lt;ref name="Clayton"&gt;{{cite news|last=Styron|first=Jeremy|title=Georgia girl talks the talk|url=http://|date=2006-12-15|accessdate=13 July 2010|newspaper=The Clayton Tribune|archiveurl=http://www.desiretoinspire.org/downloads/pdf/featuredin/2006.12.15_The_Clayton_Tribune.pdf|archivedate=unknown date|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in high school Kilpatrick led a very active and social life,&lt;ref name="About Girl Talk" /&gt; but she noticed that almost all her friends encountered similar experiences throughout middle school.&lt;ref name="About Girl Talk" /&gt; Thus, Kilpatrick decided she wanted to make a difference and create a student-to-student mentoring group to help ameliorate the middle-school experience for girls.&lt;ref name="About Girl Talk" /&gt;  After an initial rejection of the program by her school's headmaster, Kilpatrick revised her proposal and was eventually successful in being able to use her school as place to hold the inaugural weekly Girl Talk meetings.  Kilpatrick felt that, "if young girls were taken care of emotionally that they would excel academically."&lt;ref name="About Girl Talk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Women helping women" [Television series episode]. (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;. In (Executive producer), The Montel Show. Los Angeles: ABC. Retrieved from Lexis Nexis lexisnexis.com&lt;/ref&gt; As Girl Talk continued to grow, Kilpatrick knew that she would need help in funding her new business.  So, she approached Brown Bag Marketing Inc. of Atlanta, Georgia and hoped they could help her take Girl Talk to the next level.&lt;ref name="Entrepreneurs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bauer |first=Lisa |title=Entrepreneur of the Month: Haley Kilpatrick |url=http://www.energizingentrepreneurs.com/content/cr_3/2_000233 |accessdate=13 July 2010 |format=pdf |date=10/06 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; "I basically told them that I knew that I was on the brink of something huge," Kilpatrick said. "I was young, but I convinced them that if they believed in me, I would put them on the map."&lt;ref name=Entrepreneurs /&gt; Brown Bag Marketing Inc. joined the Girl Talk team and donated thousands of dollars to build their website.&lt;ref name=Entrepreneurs /&gt; Recently, Girl Talk has secured a $100,000 grant from Bell Capitol management, an Atlanta area investment advisor.  Kilpatrick said the new funds will be used for starter kits for existing Girl Talk chapters, which include journals, T-shirts and a copy of the "Girl Talk Handbook."&lt;ref name=Entrepreneurs /&gt; Since the founding of Girl Talk in the fall of 2002, it has become one of the fastest growing nonprofit mentoring programs in the United States.&lt;ref name="About Girl Talk" /&gt;

Dr. Sharpe wrote about both interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Grant W. "An overview of interpretation." Interpreting the environment 2 (1982): 2-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Grant W., and L. Gensler. "Interpretation as a management tool." Journal of interpretation 3.2 (1978): 3-9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, Grant W. "Selecting the interpretive media." Interpreting the Environment (1982): 100-122.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[forests]] as [[renewable resources]]. With co-authors [[John C. Hendee]] and [[Wenonah F. Sharpe]] he published  ''Introduction to Forests and Renewable Resources'' now in its 7th edition (2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Forests-Renewable-Resources-Sharpe/dp/1577666283/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365525638&amp;sr=1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Green Schools Campaign (GSC)''' is a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative by PenjanaBebas, the Association of Independent Power Producers in Malaysia in partnership with the Malaysia Building Integrated Photovoltaic (MBIPV) Project Team that began in 2009. Through the installation of 5kWp Photovoltaic (PV) systems in selected schools across the country, the Campaign aims to equip young Malaysians and teachers with information on the science and benefits of renewable energy. The Campaign also provides learning materials, organises programmes and established a Green Schools Campaign Project Club for the participating schools to encourage students, parents and teachers to be advocates of renewable energy.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;[http://www.greenschools.com.my/en/ "Green Schools Campaign"], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The initiative is supported by the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water, Malaysia (KeTTHA), and Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission of Malaysia), and responds to the Malaysian Government’s call to encourage the generation of power from renewable sources.

SA3.&lt;/ref&gt; Phase 1 of the Campaign, involving five schools, was completed in 2011. Malakoff Corporation Berhad, a member of PenjanaBebas, expanded the number of schools under the umbrella of the Green Schools Campaign through its own Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives, with three Malakoff Project Sunshine schools. Installation at the schools was completed in mid-2012.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = “The Green Schools Campaign echoes the Government's call to encourage the generation of power from renewable sources which would certainly reduce carbon footprint. We believe that to build an ecologically sound society, education has to start from the grassroots, especially among students. They are the leaders of our future and what they practise today will shape the way forward for the country.”

S6&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 2011, PenjanaBebas in partnership with KeTTHA launched Green Schools Campaign 2, expanding the number of participating schools by 30.&lt;ref name=article2 /&gt; Work on the 30 schools began in 2012 and was completed in 2014. '''As of 1 July 2014, the 38 GSC schools collectively generated a total of 315,217kWh of clean energy and avoided the emissions of 217,500&amp;nbsp;kg of CO2.'''

{{Quote box
 |quote  = “Through the Campaign, we are educating students about the potential offered by green technologies and encouraging empowerment at the grassroots level. What they learn in school today will have a spiral effect on the communities and a profound impact on the environment in the future,”

}}

Green Schools Campaign Phase 3 was announced in March 2014 and will see an additional 100 schools nationwide joining the existing 38 schools.&lt;ref name=article3 /&gt; It is targeted for completion by October 2015, upon which the total energy generation capacity of the combined 138 GSC schools will be 690kWp, avoiding emissions of an estimated 331,200&amp;nbsp;kg of harmful CO2 annually.

'''HiBuR''' ("connection" in Hebrew) is a voluntary student program. HiBuR's main purpose is to forge connections between students of the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by offering joint educational activities and practical experiences at both universities.

==Academic Exchange==
Student Exchange – One of Hibur's current endeavors is to establish a program that provides students the opportunity to study abroad.  This experience will enable students to:
*Globalize their educational experience
*Enhance academic opportunities that may otherwise be limited or unavailable
*Establish professional and career opportunities through networking
*Improve language skills and cultural understanding
*Experience personal growth

==Internships==
Hibur’s internship program offers students the chance to live, study and work in a foreign country. Internship departments in Boston and Haifa strive to find the best match for the students when placing them in corporate and academic environments in Israel and the United States.

As a result of faculty and student interest MISTI [http://web.mit.edu/misti/] decided to create MISTI Israel [http://web.mit.edu/misti/mit-israel/] in the Summer of 2008.

The Haifa Department, with the collaboration of MISTI Israel, helped find internships for MIT students in Haifa-based high-tech companies and Technion campus laboratories,

==Technion-MIT Activities==
Hibur’s joint educational activities including video lectures, workshops, delegations, and various enrichment and higher learning opportunities, form an integral part of the program.

'''Video Lecture''' – Throughout the academic year, Technion and MIT researchers give online, dynamic lectures in real-time about the latest research in their fields of expertise.  The video lectures are available to the greater student body and do not require prior background knowledge.

'''Teaching Assistant Workshops''' – Every year, MIT conducts a workshop focusing on improving the quality of academic classes. These workshops are geared to teaching assistants and professors alike.  In the past, Hibur organized online workshops in which Technion teaching assistants and professors exchanged ideas and information with their MIT counterparts

'''Delegations''' – Every year Hibur sends an Academic delegation of approximately eight to fifteen students to the Technion and MIT to exchange ideas, knowledge, and perspectives with students at the visited campus.  This delegation provides a great resource for students to swap information regarding their universities, native countries and ongoing research projects.

'''BizTEC &amp; 100K''' – The Technion holds a yearly entrepreneur competition called BizTEC.  The ten finalists of BizTEC then have the opportunity to compete in the equivalent entrepreneur competition at MIT, The MIT 100K.Entrepreneureship Competition.  In order to compete, participating groups must have at least one representative from the university that holds the competition.  Hibur’s programs offer students from the Technion and MIT the opportunity to connect and form groups that can work well and participate together in competitions at both universities.

'''Joint Academic Projects''' – Hibur’s online platform unites students from the Technion and MIT who would like to collaborate on final projects within similar disciplines.  Students can perform research, write, and exchange information through Hibur’s website. Hibur also assists with the logistics involved in connecting researchers with students from each university and building joint intercontinental projects.

'''MathWorks''' – Hibur has implemented a preparation course, which has helped hundreds of students, in Matlab for the Technion pre-university refresher program. Matlab, developed by MathWorks Inc., is a technical computing software program used by engineers and scientists.

(2006). Missing in Action: Teacher and Health Worker Absence in Developing Countries. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', 20(1), pp. 91-116.]&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on teacher absenteeism in India, further findings include that higher pay isn't generally correlated with higher presence, presence decreases in age and rank, and that absenteeism cannot be explained by teachers being outsiders to the communities in which they are teaching (as comparable local teachers have similar absence rates); moreover, private school teachers are only slightly less likely to be absent than public school teachers unless there is local competition between private and public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/jeurec/v3y2005i2-3p658-667.html Chaudhury, N. et al. (2005). Teacher absence in India: A Snapshot. ''Journal of the European Economic Association'', 3(2-3), pp. 658-667.]&lt;/ref&gt; In another study on education, Muralidharan (together with Venkatesh Sundararaman) found that conditioning teacher pay on their performance for two years was effective in increasing students' performance in math and language tests by 0.27 and 0.17 standard deviations, respectively, in schools in [[Andhra Pradesh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://ideas.repec.org/a/ucp/jpolec/doi10.1086-659655.html Muralidharan, K., Sundararaman, V.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17900">A '''learning community''' is a group of people who share common academic goals and attitudes, who meet semi-regularly to collaborate on classwork. Such communities have become the template for a cohort-based, [[interdisciplinary]] approach to [[higher education]]. This may be based on an advanced kind of educational or 'pedagogical' design.{{r|goodyear}}

Community psychologists such as McMillan and Chavis (1986) state that there are four key factors that defined a sense of community: “(1) ''membership'', (2) ''influence'', (3) ''fulfillment of individuals needs'' and (4) ''shared events and emotional connections''. So, the participants of learning community must feel some sense of loyalty and belonging to the group (''membership'') that drive their desire to keep working and helping others, also the things that the participants do must affect what happens in the community; that means, an active and not just a reactive performance (''influence''). Besides a learning community must give the chance to the participants to meet particular needs (''fulfillment'') by expressing personal opinions, asking for help or specific information and share stories of events with particular issue included (''emotional connections'') emotional experiences{{r|bonk}}.

Learning communities are now fairly common to [[United States|American]] [[colleges]] and [[universities]], and are also found in Europe.

==History==
In a summary of the history of the concept of learning communities, [[Wolff-Michael Roth]] and [[Lee Yew Jin]] suggest that until the early 1990s, and consistent with (until then) dominant [[Jean Piaget|Piagetian]] constructivist and information processing paradigms in education, the individual was seen as the "unit of instruction" and the focus of research{{r|roth_lee}}. Roth and Lee claim this as watershed period when, influenced by the work of [[Jean Lave]]{{r|lave}}, and Lave and [[Etienne Wenger]]{{r|lave_wenger}} among others, researchers and practitioners switched to the idea that knowing and knowledgeability are better thought of as cultural practices that are exhibited by practitioners belonging to various communities;{{r|brown|roth_bowen|scardamalia|mcgilly}} which, following Lave and Wenger's early work,{{r|lave_wenger}} are often termed [[communities of practice]].{{r|bosciussi|habhab}}.

Roth and Lee claim that this led to forms of [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] (learning and teaching designs implemented in the classroom, and influenced by these ideas) in which students were encouraged to share their ways of doing mathematics, history, science, etc. with each other.  In other words, that students take part in the construction of consensual domains, and "participate in the negotiation and institutionalisation of ... meaning".  In effect, they are participating in ''learning communities''.  Roth and Lee go on to analyse the contradictions inherent in this as a theoretically informed practice in education.

Roth and Lee are concerned with learning community as a theoretical and analytical category; they critique the way in which some educators use the notion to design learning environments without taking into account the fundamental structures implied in the category. Their analysis does not take account of the appearance of learning communities in the United States in the early 1980s.  For example, [[The Evergreen State College]], which is widely considered a pioneer in this area,{{r|tinto}} established an intercollegiate learning community in 1984.  In 1985, this same college established the Washington Center for Improving the Quality of Undergraduate Education, which focuses on collaborative education approaches, including learning communities as one of its centerpieces.

Learning communities began to gain popularity at other U.S. colleges and universities during the late 80s and throughout the 90s.{{r|smith_2009}} The Washington Center's National Learning Commons Directory has over 250 learning community initiatives in colleges and universities throughout the nation.{{r|evergreen}}

==Models==
Learning communities can take many forms. According to Barbara Leigh Smith of [[The Evergreen State College]],{{r|smith_1993}} &lt;blockquote&gt;
The learning community approach fundamentally restructures the curriculum, and the time and space of students. Many different curricular restructuring models are being used, but all of the learning community models intentionally link together courses or coursework to provide greater curricular coherence, more opportunities for active teaming, and interaction between students and faculty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Experts frequently describe five basic nonresidential learning community models:{{r|kellog|tinto}}

# Linked courses: Students take two connected courses, usually one disciplinary course such as history or biology and one skills course such as writing, speech, or information literacy.
# Learning clusters: Students take three or more connected courses, usually with a common interdisciplinary theme uniting them.
# Freshman interest groups: Similar to learning clusters, but the students share the same major, and they often receive academic advising as part of the learning community.
# Federated learning communities: Similar to a learning cluster, but with an additional seminar course taught by a "Master Learner," a faculty member who enrols in the other courses and takes them alongside the students.  The Master Learner's course draws connections between the other courses.
# Coordinated studies: This model blurs the lines between individual courses. The learning community functions as a single, giant course that the students and faculty members work on full-time for an entire semester or academic year.

Residential learning communities, or living-learning programs, range from theme-based halls on a [[college dormitory]] to degree-granting residential colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://livelearnstudy.net/]&lt;/ref&gt;  What these programs share is the integration of academic content with daily interactions among students, faculty, and staff living and working in these programs.{{r|browner}}

Micro-foundations are based on studies to understand how groups and teams increase their capabilities to work effectively together &lt;ref&gt;Argote L. (2013). Organizational Learning: Creating, Retaining and Transferring Knowledge, Springer Science+Business Media New York, 115-146&lt;/ref&gt;. If the organization is a puzzle, then the groups are pieces of the puzzle, putting them together makes it solid.
&lt;ref&gt;Crossan, M. M., Lane, H. W., &amp; White, R. E. (1999). An organizational learning framework: From learning to institution.Academy of Management Review, 24: 522–537&lt;/ref&gt; describe organizational learning as a dynamic process, where new ideas and actions move from individuals to the organization and same time organization return feedback as a data what have been learned and experienced in past. Feed-back from the organization comes to the individual through groups and vice versa. They divided organizational learning into three levels where individual learning is based on intuiting and interpreting while group learning is based on interpreting and integrating and finally organization is about institutionalizing. When these theses are compared with other scholars’ studies there can be found many similar exposes &lt;ref&gt;Gill, A.J., Mataveli, M. (2016),Journal of Workplace Learning Vol. 29 No. 1, 2017 pp. 65-78 Emerald Publishing Limited&lt;/ref&gt;. 
&lt;ref&gt;Senge, P., Kleiner, A., Roberts, C., Ross, R., Smith, B. (1994), The fifth discipline fieldbook : strategies and tools for building a learning organization, New York, Currency 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; also prove that groups are basic blocks which make a base for organizational learning. Although he claims that learning organizations work is based on several “lifelong programs of study and practice:” 
First, it is based on the individual. In his opinion, all starts with group member and his/her capability to expose the deepest desire. By that, a person can encourage others and he/herself to move towards the goals. Second is mental models, where individuals have to constitute reflect their own thought and feelings how they see and feel world against their actions and how they effect in their actions. The third one is all about the sharing our visions. Basically, it is about how we can create a commitment in a group. Fourth is about group learning and how members can develop their intelligence and ability. The last one describes system thinking.

When studying many other scholars &lt;ref&gt;Nonaka, I. (1994), A Dynamic Theory of Organizational Knowledge Creation, Organization Science, Vol. 5, No. 1 (Feb., 1994), pp. 14-37&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Chiva, R., Alegre, J. (2005) Organizational Learning and Organizational Knowledge: Towards the Integration of Two Approaches, Management Learning; Mar 2005; 36, 1; ProQuest Central pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Bressman, H., Zellmer-Bruhn, M. (2013) The Structural Context of Team Learning: Effects of Organizational and Team Structure on Internal and External Learning, Organization Science Vol. 24, No. 4, July–August 2013, pp. 1120–1139&lt;/ref&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Wencang, Z., Huajing, H., Xuli, S. (2012), Does organizational learning lead to higher firm performance? An investigation of Chinese listing companies.The Learning Organization Vol. 22 No. 5, 2015 pp. 271-288.&lt;/ref&gt;, there can be found a basic red line of all these theories about organizational learnings. It all starts from individual tacit knowledge, by socializing that to another person, it transforms through externalization to explicit where it can be shared with a team and by arguing, internalize and turn it to practice. This is the ever-lasting spiral which brings the organization to the learning path.
 
The basic of learning comes from individual and after sharing and debate it with other individuals, it became too aware. These individuals make together a group and sharing knowledge with other groups it comes to learning in organizational level.

==Results==
Universities are often drawn to learning communities because research has shown that they improve student retention rates.  Emily Lardner and Gillies Malnarich of the Washington Center at [[The Evergreen State College]] note that a learning community can have a much greater impact on students:{{r|lardner}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The camaraderie of co-enrollment may help students stay in school longer, but learning communities can offer more: curricular coherence; integrative, high-quality learning; collaborative knowledge-construction; and skills and knowledge relevant to living in a complex, messy, diverse world. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Studies show that enrollment in a learning community has a powerful effect on student learning and achievement.{{r|taylor|price}}

There are also criticism on learning in groups. According to Armstrong (2012), people put in groups lose their sense of individual responsibility, and typically the things learned through taking individual responsibility are the things remembered by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education| author = J.

Kölling was born in Bremen, Germany. He earned a degree in "Informatik" from the [[University of Bremen]] (Universität Bremen). In 1999, he was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in computer science from [[Sydney University]], supervised by  [[John Rosenberg (academic)|John Rosenberg]].

From 1995 to 1997 he worked at the Sydney University, followed by a position as Senior Lecturer at [[Monash University]] and, from 2001, a post as Associate Professor at the [[University of Southern Denmark]]. He worked at the School of Computing at the [[University of Kent]], UK, until February 2017. He is now a Professor of Computer Science at [[King's College London]], where he also occupies the role of Vice-Dean for Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://blueroom.bluej.org/news_items/24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Kölling is the lead designer of [[Blue programming language|Blue]], an object-oriented programming language and integrated environment, [[BlueJ]], and [[Greenfoot]]. All are educational development environments aimed at teaching and learning of programming. BlueJ and Greenfoot are widely used in many schools and universities.

Kölling co-wrote ''Objects First with Java'' (5th edition), with [[David J. Barnes]], and wrote "Introduction to Programming with Greenfoot" (2nd edition).

At the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Special Interest Group of [[Computer Science]] Education (SIGCSE) 2010 conference, held in Milwaukee, WI, his work was referenced as one of the most influential tools in the history of computer science education. This paper described Kölling's work on the Blue programming language, which preceded BlueJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~kay/SIGCSE/influential//|title=SIGCSE2010 Influential Papers website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microsoft patent issue ==
On 22 May 2005 Kölling made an entry to the [[BlueJ]] website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluej.org/vs/vs-bj.html|title=Comparison between VS and BlueJ's implementation of the object bench concept}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to a post on Dan Fernandez's blog (Lead Product Manager - Visual Studio Express). Fernandez described a new feature of Visual Studio 2005 that "helps you understand objects at Design Time, rather than runtime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2005/01/26/361375.aspx|title=Fernandez blog entry on the VS object test bench}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feature had striking similarities to the way the object test bench functions within BlueJ.

Kölling did not act on the discovery. However, on May 11, 2006 [[Microsoft]] attempted to patent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=20060101406.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20060101406&amp;RS=DN/20060101406|title=Microsoft patent request}}&lt;/ref&gt; the idea. As the object test bench is essential to the way it functions, had Microsoft's patent been granted, it was likely that BlueJ would have had to have been discontinued.

Kölling spoke to Microsoft, namely Jane Prey, and eventually the patent was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=23|title=Blog article on Microsoft retraction of the patent|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070209034917/http://www.bluej.org/mrt/?p=23|archivedate=2007-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernandez posted a response on his blog where he says "the patent application was a mistake and one that should not have happened. To fix this, Microsoft will be removing the patent application in question. Our sincere apologies to Michael Kölling and the BlueJ community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2007/01/28/update-response-to-bluej-patent-issues.aspx|title=Fernandez blog apology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5902">[[File:African American farmer in corn field, Alachua County, Florida.jpg|thumb|214x214px]]
The '''New Farmers of America (NFA)''' was organized in Tuskegee Alabama and became a national organization for African-American young men in 1935. The organization was formed to serve agriculture students in southern states where schools were segregated by law. Much like the National FFA Organization (FFA), NFA sought to provide young men with vocational, social and recreational activities in order to develop their skills in public speaking, leadership and agricultural trades.  The two organizations merged in 1964.

== About the NFA ==
NFA stands for New Farmers of America.The NFA was an organization designed to develop the qualities of leadership and citizenship of its members by allowing them to participate in conducting meetings, sharing in carrying out the program of activities of the chapter, and serving on committees. The organization afforded its members leadership opportunities  essential for their success as  modern farmers. These leadership abilities were developed through public speaking, judging, chapter contests, and from training received through the work of the chapter committees under the supervision of the local adviser.

== Beginnings ==
The NFA started as a vision of three men: Dr. H. O. Sargent, Federal Agent for Agricultural Education, U.S. Office of Education, George Washington Owens, Teacher Trainer, Virginia State College, and the “Father of NFA”,J.R. Thomas, Teacher Trainer, Virginia State College. NFA was a localized movement in Virginia around 1927.  H.O. Sargent, Federal Agent for Agricultural Education, and G.W. Owens, Teacher-Trainer at [[Virginia State University|Virginia State College]], were two of the earliest proponents of an organization for African-American farm youth.  While Owens wrote the constitution for the New Farmers of Virginia and helped lay the foundation for what would become a national organization, Sargent lobbied within the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]] to officially create an organization in segregated schools. As the idea grew in popularity, chapters formed sporadically throughout the southern states and region. State associations emerged next  and then sectional associations based on proximity: [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], Gulf (later called Sargent), and A-L-Tex-O (later called Almmot).  These sections held conferences and contests unifying the state associations until a national organization was officially created on August 4, 1935.

== Aim and Purpose ==

The specific purposes were as follows:

# To develop competent, aggressive, agricultural and rural leadership.
# To encourage intelligent choice of farming occupations.
# To encourage members in the development of individual farming programs.
# To encourage members to improve the home, the farm and surroundings.
# To participate in worthy undertakings for the improvement of agriculture.
# To practice and encourage thrift.
# To develop character, train for useful citizenship, and foster patriotism.
# To participate in a cooperative effort.
# To provide and encourage the development of organized rural recreational activities.
# To strengthen confidence of farm boys and young men in themselves and their work.
# To encourage improvement in scholarship
# To create and nurture a love of country life.&lt;ref&gt;Strickland, Cecil L., Sr., ''New Farmers of America in Retrospect: The Formative Years 1935-1965,'' Prairie View, Tex. : Prairie View A&amp;M University, College of Agriculture and Human Sciences, Department of Agriculture, 1994, p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creed ==
I believe in the dignity of farm work and that I shall prosper in proportion as I learn to put knowledge and skill into the occupations of farming.

I believe that the farm boy who learns to produce better crops and better livestock; who learns to improve and beautify his home surroundings will find joy and success in meeting the challenging situations as they arise in his daily living.

I believe that rural organizations should develop their leaders from within; that the boys in the rural communities should look forward to positions of leadership in the civic, social and public life surrounding them.

I believe that the life of service is the life that counts; that happiness endures to mankind when it comes from having helped lift the burdens of others.

I believe in the practice of cooperation in agriculture; that it will aid in bringing to the man lowest down a wealth of giving as well as receiving.

I believe that each farm boy bears the responsibility for finding and developing his talents to the end that the life of his people may thereby be enriched so that happiness and contentment will come to all.&lt;ref&gt;Fields, M.A., ''New Farmers of America 25 Years of Accomplishment,'' Washington, D.C. : New Farmers of America : Office of Education, U.S. Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare, [1959?], p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emblem ==
The NFA emblem was made up of five symbols:
# plow representing tillage of the soil
# owl representing wisdom
# rising sun representing progress
# open boll of cotton with two leaves attached to its base representing important economic agricultural interest of many members
# American eagle with shield, arrows, and olive branch representing the wide scope of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;New Farmers of America, ''National Constitution of the New Farmers of America,'' 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''NextStepU''''' was a [[magazine]] which was founded in the United States in 1995 by David Mammano to help students plan for college, careers and life. It is a national publication for high school students that is distributed in 20,500 high schools in 50 states. The magazine is headquartered in [[Rochester, New York]], where the first issue was published May 17, 1995. Today the magazine is no longer in production and exists as an all-encompassing college planning resource online at NextStepU.com 

Online [[student]]s can find several interactive tools to help them through the college-planning process. On the Path college-planning timeline, users are guided through each to-do before college. The site also features a $10,000 win free tuition college [[scholarship]] giveaway, a College Match tool, a scholarship search tool, and free college night handouts for school counselors. School counselors also receive a free resource mailed to them twice each year called LINK Magazine. 

In 2008, the [[Association of Educational Publishers]] (AEP) named the magazine as a finalist in the "whole publication" category. In 2007, the magazine won AEP's "periodical of the year" title in the young adult category.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2007|title=Award Programs: Distinguished Achievement Awards Periodicals Winners|url= http://www.aepweb.org/awards/07print.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; AEP has previously awarded Next Step the following awards: "whole publication design" (2006), "most improved" (2006),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2006|title=Award Programs: Distinguished Achievement Awards Periodicals Winners|url=http://www.aepweb.org/awards/06print.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; finalist, "best educational portal" (2004), "most improved" (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2003|title=Award Programs: 2003 Distinguished Achievement Awards Winners, Periodicals|url = http://www.aepweb.org/awards/03periodicals.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "best how-to article" (2002).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|year=2002|title=Award Programs: 2002 Distinguished Achievement Awards Winners, Periodicals|url = http://www.aepweb.org/awards/02periodicals.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Linked to motivational crowding theory</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25132">The '''overjustification effect''' occurs when an expected external [[wikt:incentive|incentive]] such as money or prizes decreases a person's [[Motivation#Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation|intrinsic motivation]] to perform a task. Overjustification is an explanation for the phenomenon known as [[Motivation crowding theory|motivational "crowding out."]] The overall effect of offering a reward for a previously unrewarded activity is a shift to extrinsic motivation and the undermining of pre-existing intrinsic motivation. Once rewards are no longer offered, interest in the activity is lost; prior intrinsic motivation does not return, and extrinsic rewards must be continuously offered as motivation to sustain the activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, R.Neil  |author2=Heth, C. Donald |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=Psychology the Science of Behaviour|publisher=Pearson Education:New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
The overjustification effect has been widely demonstrated in many settings. In one of the earliest demonstrations of this effect, [[Edward Deci]] and his colleagues conducted a laboratory experiment in 1971 where subjects showing [[wikt:baseline|baseline]] interest in solving a puzzle were exposed to two different conditions. The [[control group]] were not paid on all three days while the [[experimental group]] were not paid on the first day, were paid on the second day and were not paid again on the third day. The subjects were given a break in the middle of each session and were being observed while doing whatever they wanted. The results showed that the experimental group spent significantly more time than the control group playing the puzzle during their break time on day 2 when they were paid but significantly less on day 3 when they were not paid. This was interpreted as evidence that the extrinsic monetary [[Bounty (reward)|reward]] significantly reduced their [[intrinsic motivation]] to engage in the task.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lepper|first=M.P|author2=Greene, D. |author3=Nisbett, R. E |title=Undermining children's Intrinsic interest with extrinsic reward: A test of the "overjustification" hypothesis|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1973|volume=28|issue=1|pages=129–137|url=http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Motivation/Lepper_et_al_Undermining_Childrens_Intrinsic_Interest.pdf|doi=10.1037/h0035519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[Southern Methodist University]] conducted an experiment on 188 female university students in which they measured the subjects' continued interest in a cognitive task (a word game) after their initial performance under different incentives. The subjects were divided into two groups. Members of the first group were told that they would be rewarded for competence. Above-average players would be paid more and below-average players would be paid less. Members of the second group were told that they would be rewarded only for completion. Their pay was scaled by the number of repetitions or the number of hours playing. Afterwards, half of the subjects in each group were told that they over-performed, and the other half were told that they under-performed, regardless of how well each subject actually did. Members of the first group generally showed greater interest in the game and continued playing for a longer time than the members of the second group. "Over-performers" continued playing longer than "under-performers" in the first group, but "under-performers" continued playing longer than "over-performers" in the second group. This study showed that, when rewards do not reflect competence, higher rewards lead to less intrinsic motivation. But when rewards do reflect competence, higher rewards lead to greater intrinsic motivation.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenfield |first=D. |last2=Folger |first2=R. |last3=Adelman |first3=H. F. |year=1980 |title=When rewards reflect competence: A qualification of the overjustification effect |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=368–376 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.3.368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Titmuss]] suggested that paying for [[blood donations]] might reduce the supply of blood donors. To test this, a [[field experiment]] with three treatments was conducted. In the first treatment, the donors did not receive compensation. In the second treatment, the donors received a small payment. In the third treatment, donors were given a choice between the payment and an equivalent-valued contribution to [[Charitable organization|charity]]. None of the three treatments affected the number of male donors, but the second treatment almost halved the number of female donors. However, allowing the contribution to charity fully eliminated this effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellstrom|first=Carl|author2=Magnus Johannesson|title=Crowding out in blood donation: Was Titmuss right?|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|year=2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=845–863|doi=10.1162/JEEA.2008.6.4.845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
According to [[self-perception theory]], a person infers causes about his or her own behavior based on external constraints. The presence of a strong constraint (such as a reward) would lead a person to conclude that he or she is performing the behavior solely for the reward, which shifts the person's motivation from intrinsic to extrinsic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aronson |first=E. |last2=Akert |first2=R. D. |last3=Wilson |first3=T. D. |year=2006 |title=Social psychology |edition=6th |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory studies in the 1970s indicated that individuals under conditions with extrinsic rewards showed diminished intrinsic motivation. Deci and his colleagues (e.g., Deci and Ryan 1985) developed the [[cognitive evaluation theory]] to explain the results. As a sub-theory of [[self-determination theory]], cognitive evaluation theory explains that both control and competence underlie intrinsic motivation and how extrinsic rewards affect intrinsic motivation is dependent on the individual's interpretation. Intrinsic motivation increases if individuals interpret rewards as pertaining positive information about their own competence and self-control over results, whereas if they interpret the results as indicative of external control, this decreases their feelings of self-control and competence, which in turn decreases intrinsic motivation. Cognitive evaluation theory also suggests social context as another implication on intrinsic motivation. Social cues can exert either positive or negative effects on intrinsic motivation depending on the messages that the context conveys regarding a person's autonomy and competence. Verbal rewards such as positive feedback and praise are predicted to be experienced as controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. However, verbal rewards that are informational and not experienced as controlling are predicted to exert positive effects.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deci|first=E.L.|author2=Koestner, R. Ryan, R.M.|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Experiments Examining the Effects of Extrinsic Rewards on Intrinsic Motivation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|volume=125|pages=627–668|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-determination theory is a broad theory of motivation in work organizations that maintains the predictions of cognitive evaluation theory but also recognizes the limitations of the theory, such as organizational conditions under which predictions do not apply or are less relevant in real-world settings, which cognitive evaluation theory fails to recognize. The theory differentiates between various types of motivational states, distinguishes the organizational conditions where extrinsic rewards are more effective than intrinsic rewards, examines individual differences in orientation toward intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation and discusses managerial behavior that can enhance intrinsic motivation. Findings from the Deci et al. (1989) study have supported self-determination theory as an approach to work motivation by showing how managers can impact the work attitudes of their employees. The study reported that managerial autonomy support which included provision of options, giving relevant information in a non-autonomous way, acknowledging subordinates' perspectives and cultivating self-initiation resulted in employees having more positive work-related attitudes such as higher level of job satisfaction and increased level of trust in corporate management.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gagne|first=M.|author2=Deci E.L.|title=Self-Determination Theory and Work Motivation|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|year=2005|volume=26|pages=331–362|doi=10.1002/job.322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Overjustification Effect Rewards and Motivation.jpg|thumb|upright|Directional effects of rewards on motivation, depending on type of task, type of reward, and contingency of reward.]] The overjustification effect is controversial because it challenges previous findings in psychology on the general effectiveness of [[reinforcement]] on increasing behavior, and also the widespread practice of using incentives in the classroom. These findings fail to account for situations whereby the nature of activities differ, such as in cases where the initial level of intrinsic interest in the activity is very low, introducing extrinsic contingencies may be essential for producing involvement.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"/&gt; These conclusions were challenged in a separate meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Judy|author2=W. David Pierce|title=Reinforcement, reward, and intrinsic motivation: A meta-analysis|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=Fall 1994|volume=64|issue=3|pages=363–423|doi=10.3102/00346543064003363}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that [[tangible]] rewards offered for outperforming others and for performing uninteresting tasks (in which intrinsic motivation is low) lead to increased intrinsic motivation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cameron |first=J. |year=2001 |title=Negative effects of reward on intrinsic motivation- A limited phenomenon: Comment on Deci, Koestner, and Ryan |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=29–42 |doi=10.3102/00346543071001029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the detrimental effects of rewards on motivation only occur in a specific, restricted set of conditions that could be easily avoided.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Eisenberger|first = Robert|author2 = Cameron|title = Detrimental effects of reward: Reality or myth?|journal = American Psychologist|date = November 1996|volume = 51|issue = 11|pages = 1153–1166|doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.51.11.1153|first2 = Judy}}&lt;/ref&gt; This set of analyses included both high-interest and low-interest tasks, whereas the original meta-analyses conducted by Deci and colleagues (1999) restricted analyses to tasks in which participants initially had high interest. In fact, a 2001 [[meta-analysis]] showed that rewards can increase intrinsic motivation for tasks that initially hold little intrinsic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cameron|first=Judy|author2=Katherine M. Banko |author3=W. David Pierce |title=Pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation: The myth continues|journal=The Behavior Analyst|date=Spring 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–44|url=http://www.behavior.org/resources/331.pdf|accessdate=28 March 2012|pmc=2731358|pmid=22478353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, according to Eisenberger and Cameron, claimed negative effects of extrinsic rewards on task interest derived from the Deci study (1971) do not take into consideration that conditions manufactured in laboratory settings that produce these effects are not true reflections of situations in the real world. For example, in the Deci study the incentive was provided for one session and was then arbitrarily withdrawn in the next and such incentive plans do not exist in the real world. Also, the reduced intrinsic interest seen in subjects may be explained by a negative reaction when the reward was withheld.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Eisenberger and his colleges also claimed that the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of the dependent measure is highly questionable in the Deci study. Laboratory results that used the amount of free time spend on the task as the dependent measure are shown to be far weaker than when self reports are used for these measures. The Deci study gives far less weight to self reports, however self-reports about subjects' level of internal motivation seem to be a more direct measure of the psychological state of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=R|author2=Pierce, W.D. Cameron, J.|title=Effects of Reward on Intrinsic Motivation- Negative, Neutral and Positive: Comment on Deci, Koestner, and Ryan|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1999|volume=125|pages=677–691|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.6.677}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considerable research has also shown that rewards tend to enhance feelings of competence and autonomy and high standards, pressure and competitiveness are able to increase these effects. For example, employees view earning [[incentives]] as enjoyable rather than a dreaded tool of management control. These findings are in contrast with the psychological mechanism for effects that Deci and his colleges had claimed in the past. Also in the past 30 years, notable academic reviews of rewards have confirmed that monetary incentives have shown to significantly increase performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerhart|first=B.|author2=Rynes, S.L. Fulmer, I.S.|title=Pay and Performance: Individuals, Groups, and Executives|journal=The Academy of Management Annals|year=2009|volume=3|issue=1|pages=207–271|doi=10.1080/19416520903047269}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, some activities require a significant level of mastery or engagement before its attractiveness becomes apparent to an individual, in such cases external incentives may be useful to build individuals up to that level. [[Token economy]] programs represent one example in which there is evidence showing that such programs have successfully implemented extrinsic rewards to increase interest in certain broad classes of activities.&lt;ref name="Lepper 1973 129–137"/&gt;

There are also differences in effect among the different age groups. According to Deci et al. (1999), the negative effects extrinsic contingencies have on intrinsic motivation seem to be more severe for children than college students. One possible explanation is that college students have greater cognitive capacity, enabling them to better separate informational and controlling aspects of rewards. Hence they are able to interpret rewards as indicators of effective performance rather than controlling their behavior, which causes them to operate with performance-goal orientations. It is therefore speculated that such differences are far greater between children and employed workers.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"/&gt;

A rebuttal defended the original findings, concluding that this analysis by Cameron (2001) was flawed and that Cameron's inclusion of boring tasks in analyzing potential overjustification effects made little theoretical or practical sense. This rebuttal argued that cognitive evaluation theory is the most consistent structure for explaining the effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation, pointing to several other papers that have supported the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Deci |first=E. |last2=Koestner |first2=R. |last3=Ryan |first3=R. |year=2001 |title=The pervasive negative effects of rewards on intrinsic motivation: Response to Cameron (2001) |journal=Review of Educational Research |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=43–51 |doi=10.3102/00346543071001043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Education===
Findings from the Lepper et al.'s (1973) study suggest that presenting these extrinsic rewards poses central problems in the schooling system in that it fails to preserve the intrinsic interest in learning and exploration that a child may seem to possess during his initial phase in school. This also has severe ramifications on the education system, as it seems to almost undermine children's spontaneous interest in the process of learning itself, instead their motivation is driven by these extrinsic rewards. Research in this area suggests that parents and educators should rely on intrinsic motivation and preserve feelings of autonomy and competence as much as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Deci |first=E. L. |year=1995 |title=Why we do what we do: The dynamics of personal autonomy |location=New York |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-14047-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the task is unattractive and intrinsic motivation is insufficient (e.g., household chores), then extrinsic rewards are useful to provide incentives for behavior.

School programs that provide money or prizes for reading books have been criticized for their potential to reduce intrinsic motivation by overjustification. However, a study of the [[Pizza Hut]] program, [[Book It!]], found that participation in the program neither increased nor decreased reading motivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flora |first=S. R. |last2=Flora |first2=D. B. |year=1999 |title=Effects of extrinsic reinforcement for reading during childhood on reported reading habits of college students |journal=Psychological Record |volume=49 |issue=1 |pages=3–14 |doi= |url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1446&amp;context=tpr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although motivating students to read by rewarding them may undermine their interest in reading, it may also encourage the reading skills necessary for developing an interest in reading.

===Workplace===
Cognitive evaluation theory further predicts the different types of rewards that will exert different effects. According to the theory, task non-contingent rewards like benefits that are based on things other than performance, such as employment that do not consist any information regarding autonomy and competence, will have no effect on intrinsic motivation. Task contingent rewards on the other hand like [[salary]] which are awarded for performing or completing a task, will be experienced as controlling and hence will have a negative effect on intrinsic motivation. The study conducted by Deckop and Cirka (2000) reported that introducing merit pay programs in a [[non-profit organization]] led to decreased feelings of autonomy and intrinsic motivation, indicating that rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation in work settings.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"/&gt;

Performance contingent rewards like monetary incentives that are given for good performance or meeting a certain standard will be experienced as highly controlling hence decreasing intrinsic motivation. The Shirom, Westman, and Melamed (1999) study found that [[pay for performance (human resources)|pay-for-performance]] plans resulted in lower well being in [[blue-collar workers]], and this was especially evident for those who felt that their jobs were monotonous.&lt;ref name="Gagne 2005 331–362"/&gt; However, in certain cases where the reward also conveys information about competence that will in turn reduce the negative effect.&lt;ref name="Deci 1999 627–668"/&gt;

===Gamification===
The term [[gamification]] refers to the application of game design elements to non-game contexts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deterding|first=Sebastian|author2=Kenton O'Hara |author3=Miguel Sicart |author4=Dan Dixon |author5=Lennart Nacke |title=Gamification: Using game design elements in non-gaming contexts|journal=CHI|year=2011|url=http://gamification-research.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/01-Deterding-Sicart-Nacke-OHara-Dixon.pdf|doi=10.1145/1979742.1979575|}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to drive participation, often with the goal of encouraging greater engagement with the non-game context by providing symbolic rewards such as points, badges, or [[virtual economy|virtual currency]]. However, a number of academics and other critics have expressed concern that these rewards may backfire via the overjustification effect. Drawing directly on self-determination theory, these critics of gamification express concerns that gamified contexts such as [[foursquare]] might provide expected rewards for activities that do not adequately meet self-determination theory's three innate needs for intrinsic motivation—relatedness, autonomy, and competence—and therefore reduce intrinsic interest in those activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Groh|first=Fabian|title=Gamification: State of the art definition and utilization|journal=Proceedings of the 4th Seminar on Research Trends in Media Informatics|date=February 14, 2012|url=http://hubscher.org/roland/courses/hf765/readings/Groh_2012.pdf|pp=39–46|DOI=10.18725/OPARU-1773|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616221900/http://hubscher.org/roland/courses/hf765/readings/Groh_2012.pdf|archivedate=June 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crowdsourcing===
Websites that rely on [[user-generated content]] sometimes offer monetary rewards for contributions, but these may cause the contributors to succumb to the overjustification effect and stop contributing.&lt;ref name="wisdump"&gt;wisdump:{{cite web |url=http://www.wisdump.com/web/the-overjustification-effect-and-user-generated-content/|title=The Overjustification Effect and User Generated Content|accessdate=Mar 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] allows the creator of a task to offer a monetary reward, but a survey of 431 Mechanical Turk participants showed that they are driven more by intrinsic motivations than a desire for the usually meager monetary compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufmann|first=Nicolas|last2=Schulze|first2=Thimo|last3=Veit|first3=Daniel|title=More than fun and money: Worker Motivation in Crowdsourcing – A Study on Mechanical Turk|journal=Proceedings of the Seventeenth Americas Conference on Information Systems, Detroit, Michigan|date=August 4, 2011|url=http://schader.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/files/publikationen/Kaufmann_Schulze_Veit_2011_-_More_than_fun_and_money_Worker_motivation_in_Crowdsourcing_-_A_Study_on_Mechanical_Turk_AMCIS_2011.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227173340/http://schader.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/fileadmin/files/publikationen/Kaufmann_Schulze_Veit_2011_-_More_than_fun_and_money_Worker_motivation_in_Crowdsourcing_-_A_Study_on_Mechanical_Turk_AMCIS_2011.pdf|archivedate=February 27, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The overjustification effect was also considered in a study on how to maximize contributions when [[crowdsourcing]] creative endeavors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Akar|first = Oguz Ali|last2 = van den Ende|first2 = Jan|title = Motivation, Reward Size and Contribution in Idea Crowdsourcing|journal = Dime-Druid Academy Winter Conference 2011|date = January 20, 2011|url = http://www.mendeley.com/research/motivation-reward-size-contribution-idea-crowdsourcing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volunteering===
Empirical evidence shows that expected financial rewards "crowd out" intrinsic motivation, while the size of the monetary reward simultaneously provides extrinsic motivation. If the size of the monetary reward is not large enough to compensate for the loss of intrinsic motivation, overall engagement can decline. A survey data-set revealed that small financial payments reduced [[Volunteering|volunteer]] hours among Swiss citizens, and that the median financial reward provided to these volunteers caused them to work less than volunteers who were not given any payment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=Bruno S.|author2=Lorenz Goette|title=Does pay motivate volunteers?|journal=Zurich, Switzerland: Institute for Empirical Research in Economics Working Paper Series|year=1999|url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/eserv/eth:25512/eth-25512-01.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
The overjustification effect has also been linked to professional sports. The performance of numerous athletes has diminished following the signing of a lucrative, multimillion-dollar contract. Some notable professional athletes whose performances have diminished following a large contract include Alex Rodriguez (MLB), Albert Pujols (MLB), Wayne Rooney (Premier League) and Albert Haynesworth (NFL).

'''Presbyterian Boys' Senior High School''' (or '''PRESEC, formerly Presbyterian Boys' Secondary school before the Advent of Senior high school name change''') is a [[Secondary school|secondary]] [[boarding school]] for boys, founded in 1938, under the auspices of the [[Presbyterian Church of Ghana|Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[progenitor]] of the original idea for the school was the [[Basel Mission|Basel missionary]], [[the Reverend]] [[Nicholas Timothy Clerk]] (1862 - 1961) who served as the first [[Presbyterian polity|Synod Clerk]] of the [[Presbyterian Church of Ghana|Presbyterian Church of the Gold Coast]] from 1918 to 1932.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odadee.net/school |title=PRESEC {{!}} ALUMINI PORTAL |date=2016-11-11 |access-date=2017-06-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111065106/http://www.odadee.net/school |archivedate=2016-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/ghana/clerk_n.html |title=Clerk, Nicholas Timothy, Ghana, Basel Mission |website=www.dacb.org |access-date=2017-06-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328135331/http://dacb.org/stories/ghana/clerk_n.html |archivedate=2016-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The school has ties with its sister school, [[Aburi Girls' Senior High School]]. 

The school's crest has a shield with the Presbyterian symbol (the St Andrew Cross-Scottish flag with the Swiss Flag embedded and a burning torch in the middle) with the motto of the school, "In Lumine Tuo Videbimus Lumen", meaning "In Thy Light We Shall See Light", scrolled beneath the shield.  The school was originally located in [[Odumase Krobo|Odumase - Krobo]] in the [[Eastern Region (Ghana)|Eastern Region]] of [[Ghana]] before moving to its current location in [[Legon]], [[Accra]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The school anthem is  "Happy Are We", written by J. L. Anang.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160918084315/http://www.odadee.org/history/index.php?p=40 "Happy Are We"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odumase campus (1938 - 1968)==
[[File:odadeetree.jpg|thumb|OdadeeTree]]
The school was started in [[Odumase Krobo|Odumase]] after a [[Ghana]]ian educationist with the [[Presbyterian Church of Ghana]], E. A. W. Engmann lobbied for a boys' school to be started by the church.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181041/http://www.odadee.org/history/index.php?p=10 E. A. W. Engmann]&lt;/ref&gt; This came to fruition in 1938 with the first group of 16 boys and 4 [[teacher]]s. Rev. Engmann was the first headmaster.

The Odumase campus housed [[Germany|German]] missionaries, then a primary school and then a government survey school before becoming the Presbyterian Boys' Secondary School.

One of the traditions of the school is the ''ɔdadeɛ'' ([[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree) located on the campus. An alumnus of the school is referred to as ''Ɔdadeɛ''. The [[Adansonia digitata|baobab]] tree is a [[Ghana]]ian symbol of knowledge, resourcefulness and strength. New students were traditionally initiated at the feet of this tree clad in bedsheets and powdered faces. PRESEC was located here till 1968 when it was moved to its new permanent location at Legon, Mile 9.

==Legon campus (1968 to date)==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom]]
In September 1968, the new campus at [[Legon]] just north east of the [[University of Ghana]] campus at Mile 9, received its first set of students. At the new campus, it continued as a boys' boarding [[secondary school]] until the mid 1970s when the sixth form was upgraded to the National Science College. Female students were admitted into the sixth form in small numbers from September 1975. They continued to be part of the student body until June 1996 when the last batch left.
[[File:PresecDiningHall.jpg|thumb|left|Presec dining hall]]
The Legon campus started with four student boarding houses. Three were named after notable Presbyterian leaders as Kwansa House, Clerk House, and Engmann House. The fourth was named Akro House after the people of Krobo at Odumase. The next two houses to be built were Riis House and Labone House. With the completion of the National Science College buildings, Ako Adjei House and Owusu-Parry House were added (the latter named after the first Senior Prefect). Another dormitory, House 9 admitted its first residents in September 2010 as well as a new house, House 10.

A '''rondo''' is a type of [[game]], similar to [[keep away]], that is used as a [[training]] [[physical exercise|drill]] in [[association football]] (soccer). In a rondo, one group of players is tasked with keeping [[possession (sports)|possession]] of the ball while completing a series of [[Passing (association football)|passes]], while a smaller group of players (sometimes a single player) tries to take possession.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Dave|title=What is a Rondo in soccer?|url=https://www.soccercoachweekly.net/soccer-drills-and-skills/what-is-a-rondo-in-soccer/|website=Soccer Coach Weekly|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rondos take place in close proximity, with the possessing group often circled around the opposing group.&lt;ref name="Townsend"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Townsend|first1=Jon|title=The Allure of the Rondo|url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2014/09/01/the-allure-of-the-rondo/|website=These Football Times|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other possession games, in a rondo, players occupy predetermined [[position (team sports)|positions]].&lt;ref name="Baker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baker|first1=Stan|title=Rondo: A simple practice game with multiple benefits|url=https://www.socceramerica.com/publications/article/50661/rondo-a-simple-practice-game-with-multiple-benefi.html|website=SoccerAmerica|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rondos are said to improve player decision making, coordination, team play, creativity, competitiveness, and physical conditioning.&lt;ref name="Baker"/&gt; The exercise is used by major football organizations including [[FC Barcelona]] and [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], and has been credited with remaking the modern game.&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

Dutch player and coach [[Johan Cruyff]], who implemented the rondo at Barcelona, described the drill: "Everything that goes on in a match, except shooting, you can do in a rondo. The competitive aspect, fighting to make space, what to do when in possession and what to do when you haven’t got the ball, how to play ‘one touch’ soccer, how to counteract the tight marking and how to win the ball back."&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt; Barcelona played one of their most famous rondos prior to the [[2011 UEFA Champions League Final]], in which they roundly defeated [[Manchester United]].&lt;ref name="Townsend"/&gt;

[[Image:Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Saint Petersburg Lyceum 239, January 2008]]

== History ==
The school was founded in 1918. Originally, it was located in the Lobanov-Rostovsky house, also known as "house with lions" at the corner of [[Saint Isaac's Square]] and [[Admiralteysky Prospect]]. It was one of only handful of schools to remain open during [[Siege of Leningrad]]. In 1961 the school was granted status of city's school with specialization in physics and mathematics. In 1964 the school moved to the building on Kazansky Street 48/1, which was previously occupied by school of working youth, and in 1966 it moved again to [[Moika River]], 108. Finally, in 1975 the school relocated to its current location, into the historic [[Annenschule]] building.
In 1990, the Russian Ministry of Education granted school the status of physico-mathematical lyceum and experimental laboratory for standard of education in physics, mathematics and informatics in Saint Petersburg. In 1994, the school won the [[George Soros]] grant. The US Mathematical society voted the school as one of top ten schools of former Soviet Union. The first of January 2014 the school received a status of "''Presidential'' Physics and Mathematics Lyceum №239".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15459">'''Sham peer review''' or '''malicious peer review''' is a name given to the abuse of a [[medical peer review]] process to attack a [[physician|doctor]] for personal or other non-medical reasons.&lt;ref name="Chalifoux"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Medscape General Medicine|year=2005|volume=7|issue=4|pages=47|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/515862|author=Roland Chalifoux, Jr|title=So What Is a Sham Peer Review?|pmid=16614669|pmc=1681729}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American Medical Association]] conducted an investigation of medical peer review in 2007 and concluded that while it is easy to allege misconduct and 15% of surveyed physicians indicated that they were aware of peer review misuse or abuse, cases of malicious peer review able to be proven through the legal system are rare.&lt;ref name="AMA"&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/471/bot24.doc "Inappropriate Peer Review. Report of the Board of Trustees of the American Medical Association."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal basis==
Those who maintain that sham peer review is a pervasive problem suggest that the [[Healthcare Quality Improvement Act]] ([[HCQIA]]) of 1986 allows sham reviews by granting significant [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] from liability to doctors and others who participate in peer reviews. This immunity extends to investigative activities as well as to any associated peer review hearing, whether or not it leads to a disciplinary (or other) action.

The definition of a peer review body can be broad, including not only individuals but also (for example, in [[Oregon]]), "tissue committees, governing bodies or committees including medical staff committees of a [licensed] health care facility...or any other medical group in connection with bona fide medical research, quality assurance, utilization review, credentialing, education, training, supervision or discipline of physicians or other health care providers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=JCAHO Periodic Performance Review |url=http://oahhs.org/legal/legal_services_bulletin_january2004.htm |journal=Legal Bulletin of Oregon Association of Hospital and Health Systems |format=&amp;ndash; &lt;sup&gt;[https://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=intitle%3AJCAHO+Periodic+Performance+Review&amp;as_publication=Legal+Bulletin+of+Oregon+Association+of+Hospital+and+Health+Systems&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928210714/http://oahhs.org/legal/legal_services_bulletin_january2004.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California State Legislature|California legislature]] framed its statutes so as to allow "aggrieved physicians the opportunity to prove that the peer review to which they were subject was in fact carried out for improper purposes, i.e., for purposes unrelated to assuring quality care or patient safety".  These statutes allow that a peer review can be found in court to have been improper due to bad faith or malice, in which case the peer reviewers' immunities from civil liability "fall by the wayside".&lt;ref name="Abrams"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sierra Sacramento Valley Medicine, Vol. 57, No. 3, May/Jun 2006|title=Attacking Bad Faith Peer Review: Is It a SLAPP?|author=Greg Abrams, Esq.|url=http://www.ssvms.org/ssv_medicine/archives/2006/03/toc.asp|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225158/http://www.ssvms.org/ssv_medicine/archives/2006/03/toc.asp|archivedate=2011-07-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who practice sham peer review could draw out the process by legal maneuvering, and the fairness of a peer review that has been unduly delayed has been called into question. Many medical staff laws specify guidelines for the timeliness of peer review, in compliance with [[JCAHO]] standards.

==Medical peer review process==
{{main|Medical peer review}}
The [[medical peer review]] system is a [[quasi-judicial]] one. It is modeled in some ways on the [[grand jury]] / petit jury system. After a complainant asks for an investigation, a review body is assembled  for fact-finding. This fact-finding body, called an ''ad hoc committee'', is appointed by the medical Chief of Staff and is composed of other physician staff members chosen at the Chief of Staff's discretion.  This ad hoc committee then conducts an investigation in the manner it feels is appropriate.  This may include a review of the literature or an outside expert.  Thus, there is no standard for impartiality and specifically no standard for due process in the "peer-review 'process' ."

Once the physician has been indicted (and sanctioned) he or she then has the right to request a hearing. At the hearing, [[counsel]] is allowed.  A second independent panel of physicians is chosen as the petit jury, and a hearing officer is chosen.  The accused physician has the option to demonstrate conflicts of interest and attempt to disqualify jurors based on reasonable suspicions of bias or conflicts of interest in a [[voir dire]] process.

Although some medical staff bodies utilize the hospital attorney and accept hospital funds to try peer review cases, the [[California Medical Association]] discourages this practice. California has enacted legislation formally requiring the separation of the hospital and medical staff.&lt;ref name="Stanford"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Stanford  Hospital and Clinics Medical Staff Updates|date=March 2005|url=http://med.stanford.edu/shs/update/archives/MAR2005/pres.html|author=Bruce Adornato, MD|title=Column by the President of the Medical Staff: Purple fingers, Purple toes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged cases==
Some physicians allege that sham peer review is often conducted in retaliation for [[whistleblowing]], although one study in 2007 suggested that such events were rare.&lt;ref name="AMA"/&gt;

===Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesiology Medical Group===
Those who disagree with the AMA point to the case of Nosrat Khajavi. In 1996, Khajavi, an anesthesiologist in [[Yuba City]], [[California]], disagreed with a surgeon over the appropriateness of cataract surgery for a patient and refused to attend during the procedure. Khajavi was subsequently terminated from his anesthesia group. He sued for wrongful termination under California Business &amp; Professions' Code Section 2053, and the suit was allowed by the California Court of Appeals. In 2000, the court held that Khajavi was not protected from termination on the basis of advocating for what he felt was medically appropriate care. The court did not rule on the merits of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[American Journal of Law &amp; Medicine]]|year=2000|title="Employment: Physician Not Protected From Termination For Advocating Medically Appropriate Health Care"—Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesia Medical Group, 100 Cal. Rptr. 2d 627 (Cal. App. 3d 2000)|author=Arnold MS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=October 10, 2000|title=Khajavi v. Feather River Anesthesia Medical Group, Inc|author=California Appeals Court|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/californiastatecases/C029159.DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mileikowsky v. Tenet===
A doctor was allegedly subject to multiple hearings for the same charges, and his rights to an expedited hearing were allegedly denied while a suspension was in place. On May 15, 2001, the California Medical Association filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief to emphasize legal protections meant to prevent physicians being arbitrarily excluded from access to healthcare facilities based on mechanisms such as summary suspension without a speedy hearing.  This case was decided on April 18, 2005.  The court ruled that the hearing officer in the case could indeed terminate the physician's peer review hearing based on grounds that the physician refused to cooperate on procedural and other matters necessary for the good conduct of the proceedings.  Thus, the physician lost his membership and privileges at the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;''Mileikowsky v. Tenet Healthsystem'' (April 18, 2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 531, 27 Cal.Rptr.3d 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CMA_AC"&gt;{{cite web|date=January 2007|title=Health Policy in the Courts -- California Medical Association's participation in Amicus Curiae Briefs - January 2007|url=http://www.cmanet.org/member/upload/Acdept-cas.pdf|publisher=California Medical Association|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, the same physician was brought into a peer review hearing at another facility a short time later.  The hearing officer in that case also terminated the proceedings, this time due to the physician's failure to turn over certain evidence for use in the hearing.  The physician challenged the termination through the court system arguing, contrary to the Tenet appellate court ruling, that California's peer review statutes never intended the hearing officer in peer review hearings to have such powers of termination.  The California Supreme Court reviewed the case and agreed in April 2009.  The High Court ruled, among other things, that peer review hearing officers must defer the question of termination to the panel of physicians who sit in judgment of each peer review hearing.&lt;ref&gt;''Mileikowsky v. West Hills Hosp. and Medical Center'' (2009) 45 Cal.4th 1259, 203 P.3d 1113, 91 Cal.Rptr.3d 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roland Chalifoux===
Roland Chalifoux, member of an advocacy organisation called the Semmelweis Society, had his medical license revoked in Texas in 2004 after numerous incidents including the death of a patient. The Texas State Board of Medical Examiners stated that Chalifoux's practices "constitute such a deviation from the standard of care that revocation of his license is the only sanction that will adequately protect the public".&lt;ref&gt;Horvit M and Jarviss J, "Board revokes doctor's license," Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX), 12 June 2004, p.1B&lt;/ref&gt; Chalifoux subsequently secured permission to practice in [[West Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell M, "Former Texas neurosurgeon granted licenses in West Virginia," Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX), 7 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and alleges that the Texas board's actions constitute sham peer review.

===Charles Williams, MD===
Six years after Charles Williams, MD, an anestesiologist was summarily suspended by University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, a federal jury in Las Vegas awarded Dr. Williams $8.8 million as compensation for the due process violations he experienced in his sham peer review.&lt;ref&gt;Thevenot, C., "Jury awards $8.8 million to anesthesiologist," Las Vegas Review-Journal (NV), 26 May 2011, http://www.reviewjournal.com/news/crime-courts/jury-awards-88-million-anesthesiologist&lt;/ref&gt; Before the trial, which began May 16, U.S. District Judge Philip Pro made a finding that Ellerton and UMC's medical staff had violated Williams' due process rights. That left only the question of damages for the jury.  This case appears to be the highest jury verdict in the nation for sham peer review which has not been overturned.

===Richard Chudacoff, MD===
On May 28, 2008, without any notice or opportunity to be heard, the Medical Staff of UMC suspended Dr. Chudacoff’s clinical privileges. As a result of this, UMC filed a report against Dr. Chudacoff with the National Practitioner Data Bank claiming that Dr. Chudacoff was a risk to patient safety and had inadequate skills. This led to the virtual destruction of Dr. Chudacoff’s career. Dr. Chudacoff sued.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Reed opined that, in Nevada, a physician's hospital privileges are a constitutionally protected property right.&lt;ref&gt;Chudacoff v. Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev., 609 F.Supp. 2d 1163, 1172-73 (D. Nev. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals then affirmed that Dr. Chudacoff's due process rights were violated by UMC.&lt;ref&gt;Chudacoff v. Univ. Med. Ctr. of S. Nev., 649 F.3d 1143 (9th Cir. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the Patient Safety Organization (PSO)==
The Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-41) allows for the creation of Patient Safety Organizations, quality of care committees that can act in parallel with peer review boards. PSOs were authorized to gather information to be analyzed by hospital administrators, nurses, and physicians as a tool for systems failure analysis. They may be used by any healthcare entity except insurance companies, but must be registered with the [[AHRQ]] wing of the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]].

In PSOs, [[root cause analysis]] and "near misses" are evaluated in an attempt to avert major errors. Participants in PSOs are immune from prosecution in civil, criminal, and administrative hearings.&lt;ref name="pso"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Patient Safety Organizations|author=William E. Fassett, PhD|year=2006|accessdate=2007-06-10|publisher=Ann Pharmacother. 40(5):917-924 Cincinnati, OH|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/532889_7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first '''Korean student movement''' begun in 1919, when students took part in the [[March 1st Movement|Sam-il Movement]] of 1 March to call for the end of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonization]]. The [[Student activism|student movement]] has since then played a major part in several big political changes in [[Korea]]. Before liberation of Korea from Japanese rule in 1945, the main focus of the student movement was opposing this rule and demanding Korea's independence. After 1945, the student movement was mainly concerned with righting the wrongs in Korean government. Students rose for instance against the [[South Korea]]'s government of [[Syngman Rhee]] after the rigged elections in March 1960. 1980 marked a turning point in the South Korean student movement. After the [[Gwangju Uprising|Gwangju massacre]] in May 1980, the student movement got a clear vision, partly based on [[Marxism]], and had a pivotal role in the [[democratization of South Korea|democratization of South Korean society]]. Student activism is still common on the 21st century South Korean political scene.

== History ==

=== Under Japanese rule ===

==== 1919, participation in the Sam-Il Movement (3.1 or March first movement) ====
The first incentive for the student movement was the oppressive rule of the Japanese over Korea and U.S. president [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s call for the 'Self determination of Nations' following World War I.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Sung-Sik|date=1964|title=Youth-Student Movement in Korea|url=|journal=Korea Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=24–27|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[March 1st Movement|March first Movement]] (3.1 Movement) was a nationwide anti-Japan independence movement against Japanese colonial rule.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although the students did not lead in the major uprisings of 1 March 1919, their activities influenced the leaders of the Sam-Il movement.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The protest spread from Namdaemun square in [[Seoul]], [[Pyongyang|Pyoengyang]] and [[Gwangju]] to rural areas through people going to the [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] funeral (高宗, Joseon 26th king).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 3.1 Movement is the first and largest national movement that started in a colony of a country that was victorious after the first World War.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== 10 June 1926 movement ====
Students demonstrated and distributed a manifesto for independence in the [[Sunjong of Korea|Sunjong]] funeral line. Over 200 students were arrested.&lt;ref name="Kim2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jinwung Kim|title=A History of Korea: From "Land of the Morning Calm" to States in Conflict|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFPsi3IK8gcC&amp;pg=PA346|date=5 November 2012|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00078-5|page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gwangju student movement November 1929 – March 1930 ====
The [[Gwangju Student Independence Movement|Gwangju student movement]] was a nationwide anti-Japan demonstration.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.riss.kr/link?id=T10493062|title=thesis 「study on socialism student movements in the late of 1920's」|website=www.riss.kr|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded against the discrimination towards colonial education and [[Racism|ethnic discrimination]] against Korean students in the Japanese colonial period. This movement was triggered when Japanese students harassed a female Korean student.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; A large scale street demonstration started in Gwangju and spread nationwide.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The Gwangju movement was a large scale ethnic movement against Japanese imperialism after the 3.1 movement.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== After 15 August 1945 liberation ===

==== 19 April uprising 1960 ====
On 11 April 1960 nearly a month after the demonstrations against the [[South Korean presidential election, March 1960|rigged elections on 15 March]], the body of a high school boy with a police tear-gas grenade lodged into his skull was pulled out of a river in [[Masan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Already antagonized by the election and how the government had handled the protests thus far, the people of Masan exploded in fury.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kim|first=Quee-Young|date=1 June 1996|title=From Protest to Change of Regime: The 4–19 Revolt and The Fall of the Rhee Regime in South Korea|url=http://sf.oxfordjournals.org/content/74/4/1179|journal=Social Forces|language=en|volume=74|issue=4|pages=1179–1208|doi=10.1093/sf/74.4.1179|issn=0037-7732}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 April, several student leaders at the [[Korea University]] in Seoul mobilized a demonstration and led 3,000 students in a march to the [[Japanese General Government Building, Seoul|National Assembly building]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The protesters demanded a new, fair election. They didn't get a response however and the next day, 19 April, approximately 50,000 students forced their way past the police and met in front of the principal government buildings in the centre of Seoul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They had come from thirty different colleges and high schools, and represented almost all the major universities in Seoul.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Already before the elections on 15 March 1960, there was growing unrest among the Korean people.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The South Korean economy was hit by a crisis because of a change in economic policy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Poverty rules among the rural areas because residents moved to the city to look for work, but still the unemployment rate was at 34.2%. [[Syngman Rhee]] tried to forcefully keep the populace in line but this only showed the undemocratic nature of his regime.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The students wanted a reform of the election system, but were thwarted when Rhee rigged the elections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== 1970–80 ====
During the 1980s, student movements in Korea became an important force in the political climate of South Korea.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Park|first=Mi|date=2005|title=Organizing Dissent against Authoritarianism: The South Korean Student Movement in the 1980s|url=https://www.ekoreajournal.net/issue/view_pop.htm?Idx=3343|journal=Koera Journal|volume=45|issue=3|page=264|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turning point can be placed at the [[Gwangju Massacre]] in May 1980. This massacre gave the student movement a clear goal: [[revolution]]. The 1980s student movement can also be distinguished from its predecessors by its [[Marxism|Marxist]] perspective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The reason of the movement's existence can, however, be traced through the 1970s and 1960s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The generation who led the movement have later been called the [[386 Generation]]. These people went to college in the 1980s and have experienced the oppression of both students and labour first hand.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

After Korea's liberation by both [[Soviet Union|USSR]] and [[United States|US]] troops, the Rhee-regime and the [[Korean War]], the South Korean government wanted to suppress all forms of political [[Dissident|dissidence]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All forms of political dissidence were treated as pro-communist and pro North Korea and all such dissidence was prosecuted under the National Security Law.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Besides this violent oppression of political dissidence, South Korea also underwent rapid state-led capitalist reform and industrialization.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This led to a depletion of workforce in agriculture and a decrease of the rural population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The working conditions in the factories were deplorable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All civil liberty restrictions were justified under the [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Yushin system]] supposedly to discipline the workforce in the face of the threat of North Korea.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The strict labor laws were violently enforced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The [[Fourth Republic of South Korea|Yushin system]] let to great discontent among intellectuals and students in the 1970s and made campuses around South Korea spaces for antigovernment activism.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Dissidence was practiced through small reading groups and educational activities provided by religious human rights organizations to escape governmental scrutiny.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Students also became involved in distributing critical opinions through underground press and many students who were expelled from school due to such activities were believed to go into the publishing business, where critical journalists had formed the Council for Democratic Press.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Three main political camps can be distinguished in the Korean student movement of the 1980s: The National Liberation (NL), the National Democracy (ND) and the People's Democracy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although they leaned on different political views, all facilitated several organizations and together they managed to mobilize two major demonstrations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the so-called 'Great June Democratic Struggle' in 1987 over a million people attended an illegal street riot which led to a sweeping political change including a direct presidential election.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The second protest was the 'Great Worker Struggle' which opened up the path for an independent trade union movement.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== January 1987 torture and death of Park Jong-Chul  ====
The [[Chun Doo-hwan|Chun Doo Hwan]] administration, which lost its legitimacy and morality, oppressed a pro-democracy movement by force of arms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/31/world/seoul-student-s-torture-death-changes-political-landscape.html|title=Seoul Student's Torture Death Change Political Landscape | last=Haberman|first=Clyde|date=31 January 1987|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, many citizens and students were tortured by the police force.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The torture and death of Park Jong-Chul is one of these cases.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although the police announced that this affair was simply a shock death, they later officially admitted to torturing Jong-Chul with water after an autopsy was done on the body.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; After part of the affair's truth was revealed, the opposition party launched a new offense against the Chun Doo Hwan administration. A memorial rally related to this affair led to the [[June Democratic Uprising|June Democracy Movement]] in 1987.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== June 1987 death of Lee Han-Yeol ====
As demonstrations intensified, students in [[Yonsei University]] swore to take to the field and demonstrated at the university on 9 June 1987.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1216780&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31778|title=이한열사망사건|last=|first=|date=|website=doosan encyclopedia|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the protest, Yonsei student Lee Han-yeol was seriously injured when a tear gas grenade penetrated his skull and he died on 5 July.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Through these affairs, citizens became distrustful towards the [[Chun Doo Hwan]] administration and democratic resistance was extended, with the June Democracy Movement established at the peak.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Chun Doo Hwan administration agreed to revise the constitution for a direct election system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Park Mi wrote that "the student generation of the 1980s played a pivotal role in the [[democratization of South Korea|democratization of South Korean society]]".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== 2008 candlelight vigil ===

After the discovery of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|mad cow disease]] in the United States, a [[Candlelight vigil|candle light vigil]] was held to oppose the import of beef into South Korea from the United States.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pdjournal.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=58336|title=2016년, 다시 2008년 쇠고기 촛불을 말하는 이유 – PD저널|website=www.pdjournal.com|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the South Korean government suspended the import of beef.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; However, on 11 April 2008 the [[Lee Myung-bak government|Lee Myungbak government]] initiated a deal with the US to restart import of beef.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This sparked criticism that the government sold the people's life and health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

On 2 May 2008, students and other citizens held another candle light vigil to show opposition to the beef import.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; At the first meeting, more than sixty percent of the participants were high school girls.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The vigil continued for more than a hundred days and the issue finally became political.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Hundreds of thousands of people participated in the rally during its peak in June and July.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Finally the government mobilized the police and arrested a large number of participants.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; These people were put on trial for assembly and demonstration, and obstruction of ordinary traffic.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== 2011 demonstration for university tuition ===

In the election pledge, the new government promised to lower university tuition, but they failed to fulfill this pledge, funding being the biggest problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=최신 한국사회 이슈100선|last=|first=|publisher=이슈투데이|year=2011|isbn=9788963880624|location=South Korea|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; College students and related organizations demanded that the government implement its pledge, saying that tuition is too expensive and students are too busy with their part-time jobs to properly attend to their school work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.honam.co.kr/read.php3?aid=1455634800487006011|title=무등일보 -광주전남 대표 정론지|website=www.honam.co.kr|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civil society and the university students demonstrated every day.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?artid=201110181547572&amp;code=900314|title=[반값등록금 릴레이 시위-130일]한양대 장동주|website=news.khan.co.kr|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The students even did the [[10000 bae]], 10000 [[Prostration (Buddhism)|bows]] aimed at removing 10,000 earthly desires, for a lower tuition fee.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mbn.mk.co.kr/pages/news/newsView.php?category=mbn00009&amp;news_seq_no=1050477|title=대학생 "반값 등록금 실현" 1만 배 행진|website=mbn.mk.co.kr|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the government did not implement the promised half-tuition fee, but they did increase the government scholarship for the low-income bracket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20160203010019|title=저소득층엔 반값등록금 넘어 전액장학금|website=서울신문|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2015–16 demonstration for comfort women agreement ===
{{seealso|Wednesday demonstration}}
A number of NGOs and international organizations tried to investigate and resolve the essence of the comfort women issue for 25 years.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; On 28 December 2015, South Korea and Japan came to an agreement regarding '[[Prostitutes in South Korea for the U.S. military|comfort women]]' or abducted Korean women who were forced to work as sex-slaves for Japanese soldiers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newscj.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=328887|title=[현장] 소녀상 앞 대학생들 "日, 위안부 범죄 사죄하라… 한일합의 무효" – 뉴스천지|date=16 January 2016|website=www.newscj.com|access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representatives of colleges and citizens however, declared this agreement inadequate.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Eunhye Choi, president of the student body of Ewha Women's University said that: "The voice of the victims was excluded" and "There wasn't an apology from Japan. It is a disgraceful agreement. Comfort women victims desired to be made clear about responsibility for forced mobilized labour at national level, formal apology, legal compensation, recording on textbook and punishment. So that the same thing and victim would not occur again in this land."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Student demonstrations were held at [[Kyonggi University]] at Seoul Campus, [[Kyung Hee University|Kyunghee University]], Korea University, [[Dongguk University]], [[Busan College of Education]], [[Pusan National University]], [[Sogang University]], [[Seoul National University]], [[Sungshin Women's University|Sungshin womans university]], [[Sejong University]], [[Yonsei University]], [[Ewha Womans University]], [[Hankuk University of Foreign Studies|Hakuk University of Foreign Studies]], [[Hanyang University]], [[Hongik University]]; the attendees included 250 national university students' Unions and approximately 25 students who are presidents of the student bodies of universities  participated.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Activists, including many students, staged various protests against the agreement as late as January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20160127000938|title=[From the scene] Student sit-in shields ‘comfort woman’ statue|last=Herald|first=The Korea|date=27 January 2016|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/728502.html|title=Students protecting comfort women statue hope to create national movement|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/List/3/04/26/520548/1|title=Students protest to protect comfort woman statue in Seoul : The DONG-A ILBO|website=english.donga.com|access-date=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sunshine Review''' was an American nonprofit organization that advocated for increased government transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Sunshine' group rates government websites|url=http://www.columbian.com/news/2012/aug/08/sunshine-group-rates-government-websites/|accessdate=November 21, 2012|newspaper=The Columbian|date=August 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maciag|first1=Mike|title=Group Grades Online Transparency for States, Local Governments|url=http://www.governing.com/blogs/by-the-numbers/transparency-scores-state-local-government-websites.html|accessdate=1 December 2014|publisher=Governing Magazine|date=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunshine Review was a website prior to becoming its own nonprofit organization. The wiki-based website was launched in July 2008 as a project of the [[Sam Adams Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Sunshine_Review:What_people_are_saying#cite_note-81Main_Page Sunshine Review, Press Room]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Sunshine Review separated from the Sam Adams Alliance and launched its own organization with a mission of educating the public about [[proactive disclosure]] of government data and other [[open government]] [[initiative]]s.

Sunshine Review addressed several areas of [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]], including state spending, [[Freedom of Information Act|state sunshine laws]], and rating local government websites on transparency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunshinereview.org Sunshine Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820004150/http://www.sunshinereview.org/ |date=August 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sunshine Review worked with the [[National Taxpayers Union]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Portal:Show_Me_The_Spending Show Me The Spending]&lt;/ref&gt; to develop information on state spending, and with the [[Lucy Burns Institute]] which runs the WikiFOIA project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/Portal:WikiFOIA WikiFOIA]&lt;/ref&gt; Sunshine Review developed a ten-point transparency checklist to evaluate if government websites proactively and voluntarily disclose information to the public and media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/affirmative_disclosure ''Sunshine Review'', Affirmative disclosure]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 9, 2013, Sunshine Review was acquired by the Lucy Burns Institute and merged into [[Ballotpedia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Portal:Sunshine_Review&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website evaluations==
In March 2010, the organization reported that it had evaluated over 5,000 government websites, including 3,140 counties, 805 cities, and 1,560 school districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sedonatimes.com/arizona-sunny-award-winners/ ''Sedona Times'', Arizona “Sunny Award” Winners, March 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Sunshine Review launched the Sunny Awards just prior to [[Sunshine Week]] to recognize the 39 local government websites that had score an A on their checklist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/blog/2010/03/10/top-government-websites-for-tr ''Reason Hit &amp; Run'', Top Government Websites for Transparency, March 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the 2011 Sunny Awards, those who qualified had more than doubled, with the organization handing out 112 awards to state and local government websites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/core/sunny-awards ''Sunshine Review'', Sunny Awards recognize state, local governments with perfect transparency scores, March 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wibc.com/news/Story.aspx?id=1384805 ''WIBC 93.1 FM'', State Upgrading Transparency Website, March 14, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the number of awards had increased yet again, with the organization handing out 214 awards to state government and other localities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/index.php/2012_Sunny_Awards ''Sunshine Review'', 2012 Sunny Awards, March 8, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
[[St. Charles Parish, Louisiana]] reported redoing its website partly in response to the critique on Sunshine Review.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/riverparishes/index.ssf?/base/news-5/123260602747140.xml&amp;coll=1 ''The Times Picayune'', St. Charles redesigns Web site, January 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dupage County, Illinois]] promised to add county contracts to its website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysuburbanlife.com/lombard/news/x776476630/County-Web-site-earns-top-marks-for-transparency ''Argus Press Spectator'', County Web site earns top marks for transparency, Dec. 8, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Champaign County, Illinois]] was recognized by a local newspaper for its informative website based on Sunshine Review's evaluation of the county's website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2008/12/04/champaign_county_web_site_recognized_for_openness ''News-Gazette'', Champaign County Web site recognized for openness, Dec. 4, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pjstar.com/news/x1707303531/Illinoisans-more-than-one-click-away ''PJ Star'', Illinoisans more than one click away, Nov. 30, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suburbanchicagonews.com/beaconnews/news/1307360,2_1_AU01_AUTALK_S1.article ''Beacon News'', A not so twisted Web for counties, Dec. 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other local government has also upgraded their websites to receive perfect grades on Sunshine Review's checklist including [[Tulsa County, Oklahoma|Tulsa County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/opinion/article.aspx?subjectid=61&amp;articleid=20091024_61_A14_TulsaC415454 ''Tulsa World'', County kudos, Oct. 24, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owasso, Oklahoma|Owasso City]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=11&amp;articleid=20100109_12_A13_OWASSO271255 ''Tulsa World'', Owasso gets high mark for openness, January 9, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://links.mkt700.com/servlet/MailView?ms=Mzk2NDU3MwS2&amp;r=Mzk3NzE1Mjg5NAS2&amp;j=MTExMDE5OTU3S0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0 ''ICMA News Briefing'', Sam Adams Alliance Praises Carbondale, Illinois, Website As Model Of Openness, March 16, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Anderson County, South Carolina|Anderson County]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independentmail.com/news/2009/jul/29/openness-andersons-message-convention/ ''Independent Mail'', Openness is Anderson’s message at convention, July 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunshine Review was credited with inspiring [[Cook County, Illinois]] to post its checkbook register online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://civicfed.org/civic-federation/blog/cook-county’s-new-online-check-register-gives-public-access-county-spending-re ''Civic Federation'', Cook County’s New Online Check Register Gives Public Access to County Spending Records, Feb. 24, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Salary records project==
In 2011, Sunshine Review chose 152 local governments as the focus of research on public employee salaries. The editors of Sunshine Review selected eight states with relevant political contexts (listed alphabetically):&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunshinereview.org/core/blog/january-2012/which-governments-pay-their-public-employees-most ''Sunshine Review'', Which governments pay their public employees the most?, Jan. 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{colbegin}}
1. [[California]]&lt;br&gt;
2. [[Florida]]&lt;br&gt;
3. [[Illinois]]&lt;br&gt;
4. [[Michigan]]&lt;br&gt;
5. [[New Jersey]]&lt;br&gt;
6. [[Pennsylvania]]&lt;br&gt;
7. [[Texas]]&lt;br&gt;
8. [[Wisconsin]]&lt;br&gt;
{{colend}}
Within these states, the editors of Sunshine Review focused on the most populous cities, counties, and school districts, as well as the emergency services entities within these governments. The purpose of this selection was to develop articles on governments affecting the most citizens.

The salary information garnered from these states were a combination of existing online resources and [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|state sunshine laws]] requests sent out to the governments. The report found that California had the most employees earning over 150k, with Illinois a close second.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calwatchdog.com/2012/01/18/ca-has-most-high-paid-public-employees/ ''Cal Watchdog'', CA High Public Employee Pay, Jan. 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==FOIAchat==
In an effort to create a conversation between public records advocates, Sunshine Review launched FOIAchat on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wthashtag.com/Foiachat ''What the hashtag?", FOIAchat]&lt;/ref&gt;  The weekly conversation has included [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalists, including Ryan Gabrielson, to answer questions about [[public records]] requests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ijnet.org/opportunities/tip-story-chat-pulitzer-winner-ryan-gabrielson-worldwide ''International Journalists Network'', From Tip to Story: Chat with Pulitzer winner Ryan Gabrielson (Worldwide), March 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''university constituency''' is a [[constituency]], used in elections to a legislature, that represents the members of one or more universities rather than residents of a geographical area. University constituencies may or may not involve [[plural voting]], in which some voters are eligible to vote in both a university constituency and a geographical constituency.

University constituencies originated in Scotland, where the representatives of the [[ancient universities of Scotland]] sat in the [[unicameral]] [[Estates of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Alastair, "A Brief History of an Ancient Institution: The Scottish Parliament", ''Scottish Parliamentary Review'', Vol. I, No. 1 (June, 2013) [Edinburgh: Blacket Avenue Press]&lt;/ref&gt; When [[James VI]] inherited the [[English throne]] in 1603, the system was adopted by the [[Parliament of England]]. The system was continued in the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] (from 1707 to 1800) and the [[United Kingdom Parliament]], until 1950. It was also used in the [[Parliament of Ireland]], in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], from 1613 to 1800, and in the [[Irish Free State]] from 1922 to 1936.

University constituencies have also existed in Japan and in some countries of the [[British Empire]] such as India. 

In the present day there are two university constituencies in [[Seanad Éireann]], the upper house of the legislature of the republic of Ireland. Two university constituencies also exist in the [[Senate of Rwanda]].

==United Kingdom==

King [[James VI of Scotland]], on ascending the [[English throne]], brought to the [[Parliament of England|English Parliament]] a practice which had been used in the [[Parliament of Scotland|Scottish Parliament]] of allowing the universities to elect members. The King believed that the universities were often affected by the decisions of Parliament, and ought therefore to have representation in it. After the [[Treaty of Union, 1707|Union]] the [[Scottish universities]] lost their representatives in the new [[Parliament of Great Britain]] at [[Westminster]].{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} 
The [[University of Cambridge]] and the [[University of Oxford]] were therefore given two seats each from 1603. The voters were the graduates of the university, whether they were resident or not; they could vote for the University seats in addition to any other vote that they might have.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

After the [[Act of Union 1800]] with [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]], the [[University of Dublin]] ([[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]]), which had elected two MPs to the [[Parliament of Ireland]] since 1613, was allowed one member from 1801 and two from 1832.

In 1868, three new one-member seats were created: [[University of London]]; [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]] universities combined; and [[University of St. Andrews|St. Andrews]] and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]] universities combined.

In 1918, the [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]] and the [[National University of Ireland]] each received seats. Both these, as well as the University of Dublin, also received four seats in the devolved [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Stormont]] Parliament and the [[Southern Ireland (1921–22)|Southern Ireland]] Parliament respectively that were established in 1920 and first used in elections in 1921. Also in 1918, the Scottish universities switched to all electing three members jointly (see [[Combined Scottish Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined Scottish Universities]]).

In 1918, all the other English universities (i.e. except for Cambridge, Oxford and London) were enfranchised as a single constituency with two seats, as [[Combined English Universities (UK Parliament constituency)|Combined English Universities]]. They were [[University of Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[University of Bristol|Bristol]], [[Durham University|Durham]], [[University of Leeds|Leeds]], [[University of Liverpool|Liverpool]], [[University of Manchester|Manchester]], and [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield]]. [[University of Reading|Reading]] was added in August 1928. The [[University of Wales]] also received one seat in 1918.

1918 also saw the introduction of the [[Single Transferable Vote]] for university constituencies.

===Abolition===
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] government in 1930 attempted to abolish the university constituencies, but was defeated in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. Although the members for the university constituencies were usually [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], in the later years Independent candidates began to win many of the seats. In 1948, the Labour government abolished the university constituencies, with effect from the dissolution of Parliament in 1950, along with all other examples of [[plural voting]].

The [[Queen's University of Belfast (Northern Ireland Parliament constituency)|Queen's University, Belfast]] constituency survived in the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] until it was abolished in 1968 (with effect from the dissolution of Parliament in 1969) by the ''Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1968'' (1968 c. 20, Act of the Stormont Parliament).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apni/1968/20/introduction|title=Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1968|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of several measures by the then Northern Ireland Prime Minister [[Terence O'Neill]] to reform elements of the election franchise and deal with many long-standing civil rights grievances.

===Notable members for these constituencies===
The Members for the university constituencies include many notable statesmen: [[William Pitt the Younger]] and [[Henry Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Lord Palmerston]] both served as MPs for Cambridge University, and [[Robert Peel]] and [[William Ewart Gladstone]] each served as MP for Oxford University for portions of their careers. In his last years [[Ramsay MacDonald]] was MP for Combined Scottish Universities after losing his seat in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1935|1935 general election]]. Many criticised this, as he had previously sought to abolish the seats when Labour Prime Minister, and many now felt the seats were being used to provide a failed politician with a seat he could not find elsewhere.

The humorist and law reform activist [[A. P. Herbert]] sat as an Independent member for Oxford University from 1935 to 1950. He described the counting of the votes at the 1935 election in a chapter entitled '''P.R.': Or, Standing for Oxford'' in his 1936 book ''[[Mild and Bitter]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mild and Bitter |last=Herbert |first=A. P. |year=1936 |publisher=[[Methuen Publishing|Methuen &amp; Co. Ltd.]] |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ireland==
{{anchor|Republic of Ireland}} There are two university constituencies in [[Seanad Éireann]], with graduates of the [[University of Dublin (constituency)|University of Dublin]] and [[National University of Ireland (constituency)|National University of Ireland]] entitled to elect three Senators each. Only graduates who are Irish citizens are entitled to vote in these elections. There is no residency requirement so those qualifying who are resident outside the State may vote. Elections are conducted under the [[single transferable vote]] and by postal ballot.

The [[Parliament of Ireland]] that existed until 1801 included the university constituency of [[Dublin University (Irish Parliament constituency)|Dublin University]]. This was continued in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and in 1918, the National University of Ireland was also given representation there.

When the [[Irish Free State]] seceded from the UK in 1922, its new lower house of parliament, the [[Dáil Éireann (Irish Free State)|Free State Dáil]], had three seats each for the two university constituencies. However, under the [[Electoral Act 1923]] voters registered in a university constituency were not permitted to also vote in a geographical one. Both university constituencies were ultimately abolished by the Constitution (Amendment No. 23) Act 1936 and the Electoral (University Constituencies) Act 1936, which took effect on the dissolution of the Dáil in 1937. These two constituencies re-emerged as part of the Seanad under the [[Constitution of Ireland]] adopted in 1937, with the first Seanad election in 1938.

In 1979, the [[Seventh Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland]] permitted a redistribution of the six university seats between graduates of these named universities and any other institutes of higher education in the state. This was in anticipation of a possible dissolution of the [[National University of Ireland]], but this did not in fact occur, and no change was made to the electorate of these constituencies.

Some politicians have called for university representation to be abolished, on the ground that it is unacceptable that possession of a degree should confer greater electoral rights than those available to other voters. An example of this view can be found in the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] submission on Seanad reform in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenparty.ie/en/library/discussion_documents/seanad_reform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111195316/http://www.greenparty.ie/en/library/discussion_documents/seanad_reform |date=11 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Socialist Party (Ireland)|Socialist Party]] also stand for the abolition of these constituencies.

==Other countries==
*'''Australia''': the [[electoral district of University of Sydney]] returned one member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly]] between 1876 and 1880. It was abolished one year after the second member elected, [[Edmund Barton]], took his seat.  Graduates of the [[University of Sydney]] wore [[academic gown]]s while voting. 
*'''India''': India had university constituencies before independence, but these were abolished with the adoption of the modern [[Constitution of India]]. Nevertheless, today the [[President of India]] has the authority to appoint not more than twelve scientists, artists, or other persons who have special knowledge in similar fields, to the [[Rajya Sabha]], the upper house in the [[Parliament of India]]. Currently, the [[Vidhan Parishad|upper houses of the state legislatures]] in the six states that have them have graduates' constituencies, that elect one-twelfth of their members. Each graduates' constituency is defined geographically rather than by university; graduates of any approved [[List of universities in India|Indian university]] may choose to register in the graduates' constituency of their place of residence instead of registering in the ordinary constituency.
*'''Rwanda''': Two members of the [[Senate (Rwanda)|Senate of Rwanda]] are elected by the staff of universities.
*'''[[Thirteen Colonies]]''': [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] held a seat in the [[House of Burgesses]] of the [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia Colony]] in 1693, and was supported by taxes on tobacco and [[fur]]s. This seat was revoked after the House of Burgesses became the [[Virginia House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] of the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] within the newly independent United States of America.

'''Uta Thyra Hagen''' (12 June 1919 – 14 January 2004) was an American actress and [[theatre practitioner]]. She originated the role of Martha in the 1962 Broadway premiere of ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' by [[Edward Albee]] (who called her "a profoundly truthful actress"). Because Hagen was on the [[Hollywood blacklist]], in part because of her association with [[Paul Robeson]], her film opportunities dwindled and she focused her career on New York theatre.

She later became a highly influential acting teacher at New York's [[HB Studio|Herbert Berghof]] Studio and authored best-selling acting texts, ''[[Respect for Acting]]'', with Haskel Frankel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hagen|first=Uta|title=Respect for Acting|year=1973|publisher=Wiley Publishing, Inc.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[A Challenge for the Actor]]''. Her most substantial contributions to [[theatre pedagogy]] were a series of "object exercises" that built on the work of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]] and [[Yevgeny Vakhtangov]].

She was elected to the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]] in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/03/theater/26-elected-theater-hall-fame-26-broadway-voted-into-theater-hall-fame.html |title=Elected to the Theater Hall of Fame |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 3, 1981 |accessdate=2013-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; She twice won the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play]] and received a [[Special Tony Award]] for Lifetime Achievement in 1999.

==Life and career==

===Early life===
Born in  [[Göttingen]], [[Germany]], daughter of Thyra A. (née Leisner) and [[Oskar Hagen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=up4YAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=uta+hagen+gottingen&amp;dq=uta+hagen+gottingen |title=Current Biography Yearbook - Maxine Block, Anna Herthe Rothe, Marjorie Dent Candee - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-11-14|year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen and her family emigrated to the [[United States of America|United States]] in 1924, when her father received a position at [[Cornell University]].&lt;ref&gt;Port of New York, passenger list of the S.S. ''Luetzow'', September 4, 1924, sheet 41.&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. She appeared in productions of the [[University of Wisconsin High School]] and in summer stock productions of the Wisconsin Players. She studied acting briefly at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Port of New York, passenger list of the S.S. ''Westernland'', December 24, 1936, sheet 165.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending one semester at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]], where her father was the head of the department of art history, she left for New York City in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/wiacrev/wiacrev-idx?type=HTML&amp;rgn=DIV1&amp;byte=678186&amp;q1=&amp;q2=&amp;q3= "Lady Invincible"], ''Wisconsin Academy Review'', vol. 46, issue 4, Fall 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first professional role was as Ophelia opposite [[Eva Le Gallienne]] in the title role of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in [[Dennis, Massachusetts]] in 1937.

===Career===
Hagen was cast, early on, as Ophelia by the actress-manager [[Eva Le Gallienne]]. From there, Hagen went on to play the leading [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingenue]] role of Nina in a Broadway production of [[Anton Chekhov]]'s ''[[The Seagull]]'' which featured [[Alfred Lunt]] and [[Lynn Fontanne]]. It was 1938; Hagen was just 18.  This experience left an indelible mark on the young actress, as she later reflected, "My next job was Nina in ''The Seagull'', [her Broadway bow] with the Lunts, on Broadway. That sounds incredible, too. They were an enormous influence on my life." She admired "their passion for the theatre, and their discipline. It was a 24-hour-a-day affair, and I never forgot it—never!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83844-STAGE-TO-SCREENS-A-Chat-with-Theresa-Rebeck-Remembering-Uta-Hagen/all |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-03-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020143817/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/83844-STAGE-TO-SCREENS-A-Chat-with-Theresa-Rebeck-Remembering-Uta-Hagen/all |archive-date=2012-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times''{{'}} critic [[Brooks Atkinson]] hailed her Nina as "grace and aspiration incarnate".&lt;ref name="Gussow"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mel |last=Gussow |title=Uta Hagen, Tony-Winning Broadway Star and Teacher of Actors, Dies at 84 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/15/theater/uta-hagen-tony-winning-broadway-star-and-teacher-of-actors-dies-at-84.html |work=The New York Times |date=15 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She played [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''Saint Joan'' (1951) on Broadway, and [[Desdemona]] in a production which toured and played Broadway, featuring [[Paul Robeson]] as Shakespeare's [[Othello]] and her then-husband [[Jose Ferrer]] as Iago. She took over the role of [[Blanche DuBois]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'' for the national tour, which was directed not by [[Elia Kazan]] who had directed the Broadway production but by [[Harold Clurman]].  Hagen had had a revelatory experience when she first worked with Clurman in 1947. In ''[[Respect for Acting]]'', she credited her discoveries with Clurman as the springboard for what she would later explore with her husband [[Herbert Berghof]]: "how to find a true technique of acting, how to make a character flow through me". She played Blanche (on the road and on Broadway) opposite at least four different Stanley Kowalskis, including [[Anthony Quinn]] and [[Marlon Brando]]. Through interviews with her and contemporary criticism, the report is that Hagen's Blanche refocused the audience's sympathies with Blanche rather than with Stanley (where the Brando/Kazan production had leaned).  Primarily noted for stage roles, Hagen won her first [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play|Tony Award]] in 1951 for her performance as the self-sacrificing wife Georgie in [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[The Country Girl (1950 play)|The Country Girl]]''.  She won again in 1963 for originating the role of the "I-wear-the-pants-in-this-family-because-somebody's-got-to" Martha in [[Edward Albee]]'s ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]''. (An original cast recording was made of this show.) In 1981 she was elected to the [[American Theatre Hall of Fame]] and in 1999 received a "Special Lifetime Achievement Tony Award".

Hagen considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as "the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater."&lt;ref name="Gussow"/&gt;

Although she appeared in some movies, because of the [[Hollywood blacklist]] she had more limited output in film and on television, not making her cinematic debut until 1972. She would later comment about being blacklisted, "that fact kept me pure."

She was nominated for a [[13th Daytime Emmy Awards|Daytime Emmy Award]] as "Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series" for her performance on the television [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]''.

She taught at [[HB Studio]], a well-known [[New York City]] acting school on a cobblestone, tree-shaded street in the West Village. She began there in 1947, and married its co-founder, [[Herbert Berghof]], on January 25, 1957. Later in her life, Hagen undertook a return to the stage, earning accolades for leading roles in ''[[Mrs. Warren's Profession]]'' (1985), ''[[Collected Stories (play)|Collected Stories]]'', and ''Mrs. Klein''. After Berghof's death in 1990 she became the school's chairperson. {{citation needed|date=December 2009}}
  
Hagen was an influential acting teacher who taught, among others, [[Matthew Broderick]], [[Christine Lahti]], [[Amanda Peet]], [[Jason Robards]], [[Sigourney Weaver]], [[Katie Finneran]], [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], [[Manu Tupou]], [[Debbie Allen]], [[Herschel Savage]], [[George Segal]], [[Jon Stewart]], and [[Al Pacino]]. She was a voice coach to [[Judy Garland]], teaching a German accent, for the picture ''[[Judgment at Nuremberg]]''.  {{citation needed|date=December 2009}} Garland's performance earned her an [[Academy Award]] nomination.

She also wrote ''Respect for Acting'' (1973) and ''A Challenge for the Actor'' (1991), which advocate realistic acting (as opposed to pre-determined "formalistic" acting). In her mode of realism, the actor puts his own psyche to use in finding identification with the role," trusting that a form will result.&lt;ref name="Hagen 1991"&gt;Hagen, Uta 1991. ''A Challenge for the Actor''. New York: Scribner's. {{ISBN|0-684-19040-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Respect for Acting]]'', Hagen credited director [[Harold Clurman]] with a turn-around in her perspective on acting:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1947, I worked in a play under the direction of Harold Clurman. He opened a new world in the professional theatre for me. He took away my 'tricks'. He imposed no line readings, no gestures, no positions on the actors. At first I floundered badly because for many years I had become accustomed to using specific outer directions as the material from which to construct the mask for my character, the mask behind which I would hide throughout the performance. Mr Clurman refused to accept a mask. He demanded ME in the role. My love of acting was slowly reawakened as I began to deal with a strange new technique of evolving in the character. I was not allowed to begin with, or concern myself at any time with, a preconceived form. I was assured that a form would result from the work we were doing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hagen later "disassociated" herself from her first book, ''Respect for Acting''.&lt;ref&gt;[Interview in Playbill at www.playbill.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Challenge for the Actor'' she redefined a term which she had initially called "substitution", an esoteric technique for alchemizing elements of an actor's life with his/her character work, calling it "transference" instead. Though Hagen wrote that the actor should identify the character he plays with feelings and circumstances from his own life, she also makes clear that&lt;blockquote&gt;Thoughts and feelings are suspended in a vacuum unless they instigate and feed the selected actions, and it is the characters' actions which reveal the character in the play.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Respect for Acting'' is used as a textbook for many college acting classes. She also wrote a 1976 cookbook, ''Love for Cooking''. In 2002, she was awarded the [[List of National Medal of Arts recipients|National Medal of the Arts]] by President [[George W. Bush]] at a ceremony held at the [[White House]].

In 2001, Hagen agreed to be filmed giving master classes in NYC, LA, Toronto and Chicago by Karen Ludwig and Pennie du Pont, who released the video entitled ''Uta Hagen's Acting Class'', a two-part set that captures her master classes.&lt;ref&gt;"Uta Hagen", Internet Movie Database, https://us.imdb.com {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112234924/http://www.us.imdb.com/ |date=2010-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2017}} The video has been thoroughly studied and is now taught in many acting classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Uda Hagen acting class|url=http://www.coloradoschoolofacting.com/workshops.html|publisher=coloradoschoolofacting|accessdate=8 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvey Korman]] talks about studying under her during his [[Archive of American Television]] interview in 2004.&lt;ref name="emmytvlegends.org"&gt;[http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/harvey-korman Archive of American Television - Harvey Korman, 20 April 2004] www.emmytvlegends.org (accessed 18 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Hyde Pierce]] worked with Hagen in the Richard Alfieri play ''[[Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks]]'', at the [[Geffen Playhouse]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://variety.com/2001/legit/reviews/six-dance-lessons-in-six-weeks-1200468828/|title = Review: 'Six Dance Lessons in Six Weeks'|first = Steven|last = Oxman|date = 10 June 2001|accessdate = 29 September 2016|newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde Pierce spoke at her 2004 memorial at Manhattan's [[Majestic Theatre (Broadway)|Majestic Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/20/arts/uta-hagen-memorial.html?ref=utahagen Uta Hagen Memorial, New York Times, 20 March 2004] (accessed 18 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Uta Hagen was married to [[José Ferrer]] from 1938 until 1948. They had one child together, their daughter Leticia (born October 15, 1940). They divorced partly because of Hagen's long-concealed affair with [[Paul Robeson]], their co-star in ''[[Othello]]''. Hagen married [[Herbert Berghof]] on January 25, 1957, a union that lasted until his death in 1990.

'''Éditions Robert Laffont''' is a book publishing company in [[France]] founded in 1941 by Robert Laffont. Its publications are distributed in almost all francophone countries, but mainly in [[France]], [[Canada]] and in [[Belgium]].

It is considered as one of the most important French publishing houses. Imprints belonging to Éditions Robert Laffont include éditions [[Éditions Julliard|Julliard]], [[les Seghers]], [[Foreign Rights]] and [[NiL Éditions]]. In 1990, Éditions Robert Laffont was acquired by the French publishing group [[Groupe de La Cité]]. It is now part of [[Editis]].

Éditions Robert Laffont published the ''[[Quid (encyclopedia)|Quid]]'' encyclopedia from 1975 to 2007, but announced that the 2008 edition of the encyclopedia would not be published after annual sales had fallen from a high of 400,000 to less than 100,000, apparently because of competition from online information sources such as [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/frances-favourite-encyclopaedia-falls-victim-to-wikipedia-784420.html |publisher=The Independent |date= 20 February 2008 |title=France's favourite encyclopaedia falls victim to Wikipedia |last=Lichfield |first=John |location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt;
