{{Hindu philosophy}}
'''Ánanda Márga''' ({{lang-bn|আনন্দ মার্গ প্রচারক সংঘ}}, {{lang-hi|आनंद मार्ग}} ''{{IAST|ānanda mārga}}'' "The Path of Bliss", also spelled ''Anand Marg'' and ''Ananda Marg'') or officially '''Ánanda Márga Pracáraka Saḿgha''' (''organisation for the propagation of the path of bliss'') is a [[Social|socio]]-[[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[Organization|organisation]] and [[Social movement|movement]] founded in [[Jamalpur, Munger|Jamalpur]], [[Bihar]], [[India]] in 1955 by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]]. It is also the name of the [[philosophy]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|life-style]] propounded by Sarkar, described as a practical philosophy for [[personal development]], [[Social work|social service]] and the all-around transformation of the society.

== History ==
[[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar]] founded the Ánanda Márga Pracáraka Saḿgha (more commonly known as "Ananda Marga" or, less frequently, "Ananda Marg" or "Anand Marg") on 5 January 1955.  The literal translation into English is "the Organization to Propagate the Path of Bliss."  The stated aims of the organization are "[[Moksha|liberation]] of [[self]] and [[Community service|service]] to humanity".{{sfn|Dharmavedananda|1999|p=13 to 23}} In March of the same year, the first group of ''[[acharya]]s'' was created in Jamalpur.

=== Sarkar's incarceration ===

During the 1960s, the organisation expanded rapidly in India, sending [[Acharya]]s as missionaries to other continents. Ananda Marga's popularity in India put it in direct confrontation with the [[CPI(M)|Communist Party]] in [[West Bengal]]. In 1967, Ananda Marga headquarters came under attack by locals who were allegedly incited by Communist leaders.{{sfn|Lewis|2011|p=254}} Criticism of corruption in the Indian government by acharyas of Ananda Marga also put it in confrontation with Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]].

[[tantra|Tantra yoga]], as interpreted by [[Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar|Shrii Shrii Anandamurti]], is the practical philosophy which serves as [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]] of ''Ananda Marga''. According to P.R. Sarkar's teachings ''Tantra'' means [[Moksha|liberation]] from [[darkness]], the root ''tan'' meaning darkness, and ''tra'' liberation.
 
[[Meditation]] is the main spiritual practice of this ''tantric'' tradition, and through it the practitioner struggles to overcome [[weakness]]es and imperfections. The basis of ''Ananda Marga'' practice is covered by a set of rules called the 'Sixteen Points' that guide the practitioner on both [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and social aspects.

Anandamurti expounded these principles in '''{{IAST|Ānanda Sūtram}}''' a text composed in Sanskrit in 1961.

=== Meditation, ''Lalita Marmika'' dance and ''Kirtan'' ===
[[File:Yoga Meditation Pos-410px.png|thumb|left|x130px|Meditation's posture.]]
In the ''tantric'' tradition of ''Ananda Marga'' the spiritual aspirant ([[sadhaka]]) practices [[sadhana]]. ''Sadhana'' (a [[Sanskrit]] word) signifies the effort through which a person becomes completely [[Self-realization|realized]]. In ''Tantra'' the spiritual master, the [[guru]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;Who is the guru? In [[Ananda Sutram]], on sutra 3-9, P. R. Sarkar as Shri Shri Anandamurti clearly stated ''Brahmaeva gururekah náparah'': Only Brahma is the guru, no one else. Who is Brahma is explained in the first sutra (1-1): ''Shivashaktyátmakam Brahma'': [[Brahma]] is the composite of [[Shiva]] and [[Shakti]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; plays a special role. The ''guru'' guides and leads students on the spiritual path. The aspirant [[Learning|learns]] meditation by a qualified ''acarya''. An ''acarya'' is most commonly a [[monk]] or [[nun]], but in the ''Ananda Marga'' tradition there are also "family ''acaryas''". In the [[initiation]] the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual [[lesson]]s personal. In addition, he also taught ''Kapalika'' meditation to many ''[[Sannyasa|sanyásins]]''. His system of ''yoga'' can be termed as ''Rájadhirája Yoga'', ''Tantra Yoga'', or simply ''Ánanda Márga Yoga''. The basic ''Ánanda Márga'' meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga ('simple yoga'). The ''sahaja'' system consists of 6 meditation techniques or lessons taught one by one, on a personal basis.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is the short list of six lessons: 1)First Lesson: ''Iishvara Pranidhana'' (Personal mantra and ''Ishta [[Cakra]]''), 2)Second Lesson: ''Guru Mantra'' (Personal ''[[Guru]] [[Mantra]]''), 3)Third Lesson: ''Tattva Dharana'' (Concentration on ''[[Cakra]]s' [[Tattva]]s''), 4)Fourth Lesson: ''Sadharana Pranayama'' (Basic ''[[Pranayama]]''. A special respiration technique), 5)Fifth Lesson: ''Cakra Shodhana'' (Purification of ''Cakras''. A special type of ''[[Dharana]]''), 6)Sixth Lesson: ''Guru Dhyana'' (Special type of ideation for ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|Dhyana]]'').&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a set of higher meditation lessons taught to advanced practitioners committed to dedicate more time for [[spiritual practice]]s and universal [[Selfless service|service]].

According to the ''Ananda Marga'' system the ''Lalita Marmika'' dance is performed, particularly during the collective meditation.&lt;ref group=note&gt;According with the teachings of P.R. Sarkar, ''Lalita Marmika'' is a devotional dance invented by [[Parvati]], the wife of [[Shiva]].&lt;/ref&gt; This ''yogic'' dance with swaying movements, combined with a ''[[kirtan]]'' (the chanting of the universal ''mantra''), is regarded as useful in freeing the mind and preparing it for meditation.
''Ananda Marga'' system recommends to its members the practice of collective meditation at least once a week. These meetings called ''Dharma Chakras'' (weekly held in a place called ''Dhyan Mandir'') are preceded by the singing of few ''Prabhat Samgiita'' ("Songs of the New Dawn" composed by the ''Ananda Marga'' founder) followed by the spiritual dance of ''Lalita Marmika'' along with the singing of ''{{audio||kiirtan}}'' and by the practice of meditation. Before meditation the ''{{audio|Samgacchadvam.OGG|Samgacchadvam}}'' ''mantra'' is chanted. At the end of meditation the ''{{audio|Nityam Shuddham.OGG|Nityam Shuddham}}'' and the ''{{audio|Guru Puja.OGG|Guru Puja}}'' ''mantras'' are recited.

=== Vegetarian diet, yogic asanas, physical exercises and yogic treatments ===
[[File:Sarvangasana.jpg|thumb|x180px|Yoga [[Sarvangasana]].]]
[[File:Urdhva tandava.png|thumb|x200px|[[Tandava]] dance.  One of the 108 Tandava poses of [[Nataraja]] (dancing [[Shiva]]).]]  The basic practices of Ananda Marga consist of yoga [[asana]]s, ''[[mudra]]s'', ''[[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s'', ''[[pranayama]]'', ''[[Massage#Self massage|self-massage]]'' and two specific dances, ''[[Kaosikii dance|kaos'ikii]]'' and ''[[tandava]]''. [[Lacto-vegetarianism|Lacto]]-vegetarian [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and [[fasting]] are also included, as a fundamental part of yogic practice.
*[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]] and [[fasting]]: [[Lacto-vegetarianism|Lacto]]-vegetarian diet of Ananda Marga avoids meat, fish, [[egg (food)|egg]]s and some substances which are claimed to have a negative effect on the mind, particularly if "mucus-producing."  Moreover, on specific monthly dates called ''[[Ekadashi]]'' (Sanskrit: একাদশী, ekādaśī: is the eleventh day after the [[full moon]] or after the [[new moon]]),&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Ananda Marga'' ''[[acharya]]s'' practice fasting in two additional days per month called ''Purnima'' and ''Amavasya''&lt;/ref&gt; the regular practice of ''Upavasa'' (yoga [[fasting]]) is recommended to improve health and strengthen the mind.
* ''[[Yoga]] [[asana]]s'', ''[[mudra]]s'' and ''[[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s'': comprises 42 [[asana]]s&lt;ref group=note&gt;The following are the Ananda Marga asanasas listed from P.R. Sarkar in "''Ananda Marga  Caryacarya'' part 3": ''Sarvanungasana, Matsyamudra, [[Matsyasana]], Matsyendrasana, [[Virasana]], [[Cakrasana]], Naokasana (or [[Dhanurasana]]), Utkata Pascimottanasana, Parvatasana (or [[Halasana]]), Shivasana, [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]], [[Siddhasana]], Baddha Padmasana, [[Kukkutasana]], [[Gomukhasana]], [[Mayurasana]], [[Kurmakasana]], Sahaja Utkatasana, [[Shalabhasana]], [[Bhujaungasana]], [[Shashaungasana]], Bhastrikasana, Janushirasana, Ardhashivasana, Ardhakurmakasana (or Dirgha Pranama), Yogasana (or Yogamudra), Tuladandasana, Ustrasana, Utkata Kurmakasana, Jatila Utkatasana, Utkata Vajrasana, Padahastasana, Shivasana, Padmasana, Karmasana, Jinanasana, Bhavasana, Granthimuktasana, Garudasana, Dvisamakonasana, Tejasana, Mandukasana''.&lt;/ref&gt; which were chosen by Sarkar.  There are mainly two types of asana: ''svasthyasanas'' and ''dhyanasanas''.&lt;ref&gt;Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 2010, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;  They should be performed at least once a day.  15 ''Yoga [[mudra]]s'' and ''[[Bandha (Yoga)|bandha]]s'' are also part of the basic Ananda Marga yoga.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Mudras and bandhas are also listed in "''Ananda Marga Caryacarya'' part 3": ''Uddayana Mudra, Bandhatraya Yoga (Mahamudra, Mahabandha, Mahaveda), Parthivii Mudra, Ambhasii Mudra, Agneyii Mudra, Vayavii Mudra, Akashii Mudra, Manasii Mudra, Agnisara Mudra, Kakacaincu Mudra,  Trimunda Mudra, Ashvinii Mudra, Vajrolii Mudra''.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Yoga|Yogic]]'' [[Therapy|treatments]]: in 1957 Sarkar published in Bengali ''Yaogika Cikitsa o Dravyaguna'', which was translated into English and published in 1983, with revisions under the title ''[[Yogic Treatments and Natural Remedies]]''. In this handbook, he gave indications on yogic treatments using ásanas and mudrás combined with claims about natural and traditional remedies for about forty diseases.  The book also contains many tips for maintaining good health through the use of water, [[clay]], etc.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In the preface the author specifically warns the reader not to risk of practising ''ásanas'' and ''mudrás'' without the guidance of an experienced ''yoga'' teacher.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Kaoshikii]]'': the 'dance for mental expansion', was defined by Sarkar a 'physico-psycho-spiritual dannce,' performed by all, and consists of 18 mudras aligning with 6 physical postures, each associated with a specific [[idea]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;The spiritual ideation is carried along with the dance in order to establish a subtle link with the divine.&lt;/ref&gt; while strengthening [[Human body|body]] and [[mind]] and making them flexible.
* ''[[Tandava]]'' or ''Tāṇḍava'': is a vigorous dance.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Associated with [[Shiva]] in his cosmic dancer image of [[Nataraja]].&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''tandava'' is derived from the Sanskrit word ''tandu'', which means 'to jump'.  This dance is only performed by male followers in ''Ananda Marga''.  The dance is performed to imbue the practitioner's mind with [[courage]] and [[honour]], dispelling all sorts of complexes and [[fear]], even fear of death itself.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Thus the dance also has an associated ideation. The dancer starts off with the two arms outstretched, the left arm with an open [[Hand anatomy|palm]], and the right arm with a clenched fist. The dancer ideates holding a human [[skull]] in the left hand, [[symbol]]izing death, and ideates on holding a [[knife]] in the right, symbolizing the fight for life.  The actual objects (human skull and knife) may be also used.  The dance starts with a jump, landing with bent knees.  Another jump follows, and the dance continues in a jumping manner, lifting one leg then the other continuously.

== Spiritual and Social Philosophy ==
The philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' is a synthetic outlook, recognizing a thiestic singulatity or 'Supreme Consciousness',&lt;ref&gt;See: Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti, 1954, pp. 15 and 68.&lt;/ref&gt; which is claimed to be both [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] and manifested in all.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This [[universe]], having been created by the 'Supreme Consciousness', is existing in the 'Supreme Entity': "The 'Supreme Entity' is the vastest [[entity]]; the ultimate source of all cosmic emanations. The 'Supreme Entity', which is difficult to conceive, is the subtlest of the subtle. He is farther away than any other entity, but again He is nearer than the nearest. Only the one who looks into the innermost recesses of himself can realize the 'Supreme Entity'." (Shrii Shrii Anandamurti)&lt;/ref&gt; It covers both the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and the social combining the two in a unique synthesis of [[Universalism|universal]] [[Visual perception|vision]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;In his famous discourse "''Sambhúti'' and ''Mahásambhúti''" given in July 1967, [[Delhi]], India during the DMC (''Dharma Maha Chakra'') P.R. Sarkar well explained this concept: "In short, whatever was created in the past is the original creation (''sambhúti'') of God. The sum total of all creations is the Cosmic Order (''Brahmáńd́a''). This includes the [[sun]] as well as the small [[ant]] which crawls on the [[earth]]. Whether it is a dead [[star]] or a living star, whether it is a [[nebula]] or a [[Milky Way]] or a [[galaxy]] – all belong to one universal family."&lt;/ref&gt;
To this end ''Ananda Marga'' suggests a [[Pragmatism|practical]], [[Rationality|rational]], and systematic [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]] for the balanced development of all human potentialities: [[Physical body|physical]], [[Energy (psychological)|psychic]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]]. This [[system]] incorporate [[Practice (social theory)|practice]]s that range from [[hygiene]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[Asanas|yoga postures]], to a [[Science|scientific]] [[Technology|technique]] of [[meditation]] based on [[morality|moral rules]] and directed to the inner fulfillment. It recognizes that a balance is needed between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mundane]] aspects of [[existence]], and that neither one should be neglected at the [[expense]] of the other. Hence, the [[goal]] of ''Ananda Marga'' is "[[self-realization]] and the welfare of all".

The [[Spirituality|spiritual]] philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' covers a vast range of [[Topic–comment|topic]]s and can be [[Learning|learned]] from P.R. Sarkar's publications. ''Ananda Marga'' philosophy recognizes that the [[universe]] is the creation of the mental thought waves of the 'Supreme consciousness'. The following is a brief list of the essential elements of ''Ananda Marga'' Spiritual Philosophy:
* '''Atma''' or '''[[Soul]]''' and '''[[Paramatma]]''' or the '''[[Cosmic Consciousness]]''': the Consciousness (''Purusa'') is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] in the unit objects forming the "unit consciousness" (''atma'') or [[soul]]. Particularly the reflection of the soul on the mind is called ''jiivatma'' and in that case the "reflector-soul" is called ''Paramatma'' (Supreme Soul).&lt;ref group=note&gt;''Vis’aya purus’a'vabha’shah jiiva’tma’'': "The reflection of Consciousness - ''Purusa'' - in the unit object is known as ''jiiva’tma'' - "unit soul" - (''A’nanda Sutram'', Chapter 2, Sutra 8 (2-8) in Avadhūtika Ānanda Mitra Ācāryā, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Realms of the [[Mind]]''': according to ''Ananda Marga'' philosophy the human mind is composed of five layers called ''Kosas'':&lt;ref group=note&gt;The last three deeper layers are collectively called "Causal Mind". "Causal" signifies that these layers are in the most direct contact with the "Causal Consciousness" from which the mind has evolved and within which it exists.&lt;/ref&gt; 1)''Kamamaya Kosa'' ("desire layer") or "Crude Mind": is the crudest layer, purified through adherence to the yogic code of morality, Yama-Niyama.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This ''Kosa'' controls the various autonomic activities of the body and the expression of the mental propensities, known as ''vrtti'', in [[Samskrta]].&lt;/ref&gt; 2)''Manomaya Kosa'' ("layer of thinking") or "Subtle Mind": is the layer of thought and memory.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This ''Kosa'' gives experience of pleasure and pain. It is developed naturally through physical clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by ''pranayama'' with cosmic ideation.&lt;/ref&gt; 3)''Atimanasa Kosa'' or "Supramental Mind": is the intuitive layer.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This ''Kosa''  gives the capacity of intuitive [[dream]]s, [[clairvoyance]], [[telepathy]] and [[creativity|creative]] insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by methods of ''pratyahara'' (withdrawal) such as ''shuddhis'' and ''Guru Puja''.&lt;/ref&gt; 4)''Vijinanamaya Kosa'' ("layer of the special knowledge") or "Subliminal Mind": is the layer of conscience or discrimination (''viveka'') and ''[[Vairagya|vaeragya]]'' (non-attachment).&lt;ref group=note&gt;This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of ''dharana''.&lt;/ref&gt; 5)''Hiranyamaya Kosa'' ("golden level") or "Subtle Causal Mind": is the subtlest layer. Here the [[awareness]] of mind is very close to the direct [[experience]] of "Supreme Consciousness".&lt;ref group=note&gt;Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' accelerates this process for ''[[sadhaka]]s'' (spirituals aspirants).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Microvita theory]]''': ''Microvita'' is plural for ''Micro-vitum'' and literally means "micro-life". The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=325}} The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.

=== Social philosophy ===
The social outlook of ''Ananda Marga'' recognizes that the welfare of the [[individual]] is linked with the welfare of the [[collective]], each relying on the other for its [[existence]] and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the [[Rights|right]] to [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] of life and [[Social change|development]] and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as [[race (classification of humans)|race]], nationality and religion. ''Ananda Marga'' advocates a world of [[justice]], security and [[peace]] for all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anandamarga.org/social-philosophy/ Ananda Marga Social Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; The Social Philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' can be categorized under the topics: 
* '''[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]''': in 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of [[Society|human society]] with the [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] of his new theory of "[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]".&lt;ref&gt;See: Sarkar, P. R., 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] – I have designated this as "Neohumanism". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]]." (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system "Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]]." Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a "psycho-pedagogical approach" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society." (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo– humanist Education''.).&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Culture''': In his discourse "Talks on Prout", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms "culture" and "customs". According to Sarkar "culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life..." but "...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same."{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:
{{Quote|''...If the term “culture” is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek "paidéia" to the Latin "humanitas", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: “the culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations... it is the same, but varying in expression." (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)...''{{sfn|Maggipinto|2000}}}}
* '''[[Progressive utilization theory|PROUT]]''' ("[[Progressivism|Progressive]] Utilization [[Theory]]"): is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] theory first mentioned in 1959 by P. R. Sarkar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Sociology of knowledge to Zaroastrianism |editor-first=Edward |editor-last=Craig |editor-link=Edward Craig (philosopher) |publisher= Routledge (Taylor &amp; Francis) |year=1998 |isbn=0-415-16916-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his speech "The Cosmic Brotherood".&lt;ref&gt;Later published in Sarkar, P. R. (1961-2001) p. 89-97.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Sarkar founded the organization "Proutist Block of India" (PBI), to further the ideals of his theory through political and social action.{{sfn|Fukui|1985|p=357}}

=== ''Tantra'' in ''Ananda Marga'' ===
{{quote box|width=30em|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|title=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti on ''tantrics'' and ''tantric'' cult |align=left|quote=""A person who, irrespective of [[caste]], [[creed]] or religion, aspires for spiritual expansion or does something concrete, is a ''Tantric''. ''Tantra' in itself is neither a religion nor an 'ism'. ''Tantra'' is a fundamental spiritual science. So wherever there is any spiritual practice it should be taken for granted that it stands on the Tantric cult. Where there is no spiritual practice, where people pray to God for the fulfilment of narrow worldly desires, where people’s only slogan is “Give us this and give us that” – only there do we find that Tantra is discouraged. So only those who do not understand Tantra, or even after understanding Tantra do not want to do any spiritual practice, oppose the cult of Tantra."|source=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti´s "Tantra and its Effect on Society", 1959.{{sfn|Anandamurti|1959}}}}
Sarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of ''Tantra'', infusing new insights in [[Psychology|human psychology]], [[social theory]] and in each individuals' [[role]]s as spiritual and "socio-economic-cultural-political" beings.
''Ánanda Márga Tantra'' has a broad [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] base which allows for ways of [[Knowledge|knowing]], [[feeling]] and [[Process (science)|processing]] which go far beyond [[intellect]]uality or limited [[rationality]]. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Shrii Shrii Ánandamúrti notes, "spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurukul.edu Bussey, Marcus. ''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']&lt;/ref&gt;
''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.&lt;ref group=note&gt;"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values".(Coyle, G. 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===
According to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.
P.R. Sarkar clearly explains&lt;ref&gt;See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.

{{Ancient Egyptian religion|expanded=all}}
{{Ancient Near East mythology}}
'''Ancient Egyptian religion''' was a complex system of [[polytheistic]] beliefs and rituals that formed an integral part of [[ancient Egypt]]ian society.  It centered on the Egyptians' interaction with many [[deity|deities]] believed to be present in, and in control of, the world. Rituals such as prayer and offerings were provided to the gods to gain their favor. Formal religious practice centered on the [[pharaoh]], the rulers of Egypt, believed to possess a divine power by virtue of their position. They acted as intermediaries between their people and the gods, and were obligated to sustain the gods through rituals and offerings so that they could maintain ''[[maat]]'', the order of the cosmos. The state dedicated enormous resources to Egyptian rituals and to the construction of the [[Egyptian temple|temples]].

Individuals could interact with the gods for their own purposes, appealing for help through prayer or compelling the gods to act through magic. These practices were distinct from, but closely linked with, the formal rituals and institutions. The popular religious tradition grew more prominent in the course of Egyptian history as the status of the pharaoh declined. Egyptian belief in the afterlife and [[Ancient Egyptian burial customs|funerary practices]] is evident in great efforts made to ensure the survival of their [[Egyptian soul|souls]] after death, providing tombs, grave goods, and offerings to preserve the bodies and spirits of the deceased.

The religion had its roots in Egypt's prehistory and lasted for more than 3,000 years. The details of religious belief changed over time as the importance of particular gods rose and declined, and their intricate relationships shifted.  At various times, certain gods became preeminent over the others, including the sun god [[Ra]], the creator god [[Amun]], and the mother goddess [[Isis]]. For a brief period, in the [[Atenism|theology]] promulgated by the Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], a single god, the [[Aten]], replaced the traditional pantheon. Ancient Egyptian religion and mythology left behind many writings and monuments, along with significant influences on ancient and modern cultures.

==Theology==
The beliefs and rituals now referred to as "ancient Egyptian religion" were integral within every aspect of Egyptian culture. [[Ancient Egyptian language|The Egyptian language]] possessed no single term corresponding to the modern European concept of religion. Ancient Egyptian religion was not a monolithic institution, but consisted of a vast and varying set of beliefs and practices, linked by their common focus on the interaction between the world of humans and the world of the divine. The characteristics of the gods who populated the divine realm were inextricably linked to the Egyptians' understanding of the properties of the world in which they lived.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 1–5, 80}}

The Egyptians believed that the phenomena of nature were divine forces in and of themselves.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 63–64, 82}}  These deified forces included the elements, animal characteristics, or abstract forces.  The Egyptians believed in a pantheon of gods, which were involved in all aspects of nature and human society. Their religious practices were efforts to sustain and placate these phenomena and turn them to human advantage.&lt;ref name = "Allen 43"&gt;{{Harvnb | Allen | 2000 | pp = 43–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[polytheism|polytheistic]] system was very complex, as some deities were believed to exist in many different manifestations, and some had multiple mythological roles.  Conversely, many natural forces, such as the sun, were associated with multiple deities.  The diverse pantheon ranged from gods with vital roles in the universe to minor deities or "demons" with very limited or localized functions.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 30, 32, 89}}  It could include gods adopted from foreign cultures, and sometimes humans: deceased pharaohs were believed to be divine, and occasionally, distinguished commoners such as [[Imhotep]] also became deified.{{Sfn | Silverman | 1991 | pp = 55–58}}

The depictions of the gods in [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] were not meant as literal representations of how the gods might appear if they were visible, as the gods' true natures were believed to be mysterious. Instead, these depictions gave recognizable forms to the abstract deities by using symbolic imagery to indicate each god's role in nature.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 53}}  Thus, for example, the funerary god [[Anubis]] was portrayed as a [[jackal]], a creature whose scavenging habits threatened the preservation of the body, in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection.  His black skin was symbolic of the color of [[mummy|mummified]] flesh and the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of [[resurrection]]. This iconography was not fixed, and many of the gods could be depicted in more than one form.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 28, 187–89}}

Many gods were associated with particular regions in Egypt where their cults were most important. However, these associations changed over time, and they did not mean that the god associated with a place had originated there. For instance, the god [[Montu]] was the original patron of the city of Thebes. Over the course of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], however, he was displaced in that role by Amun, who may have arisen elsewhere. The national popularity and importance of individual gods fluctuated in a similar way.{{Sfn | Teeter | 2001 | pp = 340–44}}

===Associations between deities===
The Egyptian gods had complex interrelationships, which partly reflected the interaction of the forces they represented. The Egyptians often grouped gods together to reflect these relationships. Some groups of deities were of indeterminate size, and were linked by their similar functions. These often consisted of minor deities with little individual identity. Other combinations linked independent deities based on the symbolic meaning of [[numbers in Egyptian mythology]]; for instance, pairs of deities usually represent the duality of opposite phenomena. One of the more common combinations was a family triad consisting of a father, mother, and child, who were worshipped together. Some groups had wide-ranging importance. One such group, the [[Ennead]], assembled nine deities into a theological system that was involved in the mythological areas of creation, kingship, and the afterlife.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 74–79}}

The relationships between deities could also be expressed in the process of [[syncretism]], in which two or more different gods were linked to form a composite deity.  This process was a recognition of the presence of one god "in" another when the second god took on a role belonging to the first.  These links between deities were fluid, and did not represent the permanent merging of two gods into one; therefore, some gods could develop multiple syncretic connections.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 27–28}} Sometimes, syncretism combined deities with very similar characteristics. At other times it joined gods with very different natures, as when Amun, the god of hidden power, was linked with [[Ra]], the god of the sun. The resulting god, Amun-Ra, thus united the power that lay behind all things with the greatest and most visible force in nature.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 33–35}}

===Unifying tendencies===
Many deities could be given epithets that seem to indicate that they were greater than any other god, suggesting some kind of unity beyond the multitude of natural forces. This is particularly true of a few gods who, at various points, rose to supreme importance in Egyptian religion. These included the royal patron [[Horus]], the sun god [[Ra]], and the mother goddess [[Isis]].{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 36, 67}}  During the [[New Kingdom]] (c. 1550–1070 BC) Amun held this position. The theology of the period described in particular detail Amun's presence in and rule over all things, so that he, more than any other deity, embodied the all-encompassing power of the divine.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 189–92, 241–42}}

Because of theological statements like this, many past Egyptologists, such as {{ill|Siegfried Morenz|de}}, believed that beneath the polytheistic traditions of Egyptian religion there was an increasing belief in a unity of the divine, moving toward [[monotheism]]. Instances in Egyptian literature where "god" is mentioned without reference to any specific deity would seem to give this view added weight. However, in 1971 [[Erik Hornung]] pointed out that the traits of an apparently supreme being could be attributed to many different gods, even in periods when other gods were preeminent, and further argued that references to an unspecified  "god" are meant to refer flexibly to any deity. He therefore argued that, while some individuals may have [[henotheism|henotheistically]] chosen one god to worship, Egyptian religion as a whole had no notion of a divine being beyond the immediate multitude of deities. Yet the debate did not end there; [[Jan Assmann]] and [[James P. Allen]] have since asserted that the Egyptians did to some degree recognize a single divine force. In Allen's view, the notion of an underlying unity of the divine coexisted inclusively with the polytheistic tradition. It is possible that only the Egyptian theologians fully recognized this underlying unity, but it is also possible that ordinary Egyptians identified the single divine force with a single god in particular situations.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 36–39}}{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 10–11}}

===Atenism===
{{main |Atenism}}
During the New Kingdom the pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] abolished the official worship of other gods in favor of the sun-disk [[Aten]]. This is often seen as the first instance of true monotheism in history, although the details of Atenist theology are still unclear and the suggestion that it was monotheistic is disputed. The exclusion of all but one god from worship was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition and some see Akhenaten as a practitioner of [[monolatry]] rather than monotheism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Dominic | last = Montserrat | author-link = Dominic Montserrat | title = Akhenaten: History, Fantasy and Ancient Egypt | publisher = Routledge | year = 2000 | ISBN = 0-415-18549-1 | pages = 36ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Najovits|first=Simson|title= Egypt, trunk of the tree | volume = 2 |year=2003|publisher=Algora|isbn=978-0-87586-256-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrR848g3gp8C&amp;pg=PA88 |pages=131–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshipping any but the Aten. Under Akhenaten's successors Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | p = 35}}{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | p = 198}}

==Other important concepts==

===Cosmology===
[[File:Geb, Nut, Shu.jpg|thumb|280px|The air god Shu, assisted by other gods, holds up Nut, the sky, as Geb, the earth, lies beneath.]]
The Egyptian conception of the universe centered on ''[[Maat]]'', a word that encompasses several concepts in English, including "truth", "justice", and "order."  It was the fixed, eternal order of the universe, both in the cosmos and in human society. It had existed since the creation of the world, and without it the world would lose its cohesion. In Egyptian belief, Maat was constantly under threat from the forces of disorder, so all of society was required to maintain it. On the human level this meant that all members of society should cooperate and coexist; on the cosmic level it meant that all of the forces of nature—the gods—should continue to function in balance.&lt;ref name= "Allen 115"&gt;{{Harvnb | Allen | 2000 | pp = 115–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This latter goal was central to Egyptian religion. The Egyptians sought to maintain Maat in the cosmos by sustaining the gods through offerings and by performing rituals which staved off disorder and perpetuated the cycles of nature.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 4–5}}&lt;ref name="Shafer 2"&gt;{{Harvnb | Shafer | 1997 | pp = 2–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important part of the Egyptian view of the cosmos was the conception of time, which was greatly concerned with the maintenance of Maat. Throughout the linear passage of time, a cyclical pattern recurred, in which Maat was renewed by periodic events which echoed the original creation. Among these events were the annual Nile flood and the succession from one king to another, but the most important was the daily journey of the sun god Ra.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 68–79}}{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 104, 127}}

When thinking of the shape of the cosmos, the Egyptians saw the earth as a flat expanse of land, personified by the god [[Geb]], over which arched the sky goddess [[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]. The two were separated by Shu, the god of air. Beneath the earth lay a parallel [[underworld]] and undersky, and beyond the skies lay the infinite expanse of [[Nu (mythology)|Nu]], the chaos that had existed before creation.{{Sfn | Lesko | 1991 | pp = 117–21}}{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 45–46}}  The Egyptians also believed in a place called the [[Duat]], a mysterious region associated with death and rebirth, that may have lain in the underworld or in the sky.  Each day, Ra traveled over the earth across the underside of the sky, and at night he passed through the Duat to be reborn at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, James P., "The Cosmology of the Pyramid Texts", in {{Harvnb | Simpson | 1989 | pp = 20–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Egyptian belief, this cosmos was inhabited by three types of sentient beings. One was the gods; another was the spirits of deceased humans, who existed in the divine realm and possessed many of the gods' abilities. Living humans were the third category, and the most important among them was the pharaoh, who bridged the human and divine realms.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | p = 31}}

[[File:RamsesIIEgypt.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Colossal statue of the Pharaoh [[Ramesses II]]]]

===Divine pharaoh===
{{see also|Pharaoh}}
Egyptologists have long debated the degree to which the pharaoh was considered a god. It seems most likely that the Egyptians viewed royal authority itself as a divine force.  Therefore, although the Egyptians recognized that the pharaoh was human and subject to human weakness, they simultaneously viewed him as a god, because the divine power of kingship was incarnated in him. He therefore acted as intermediary between Egypt's people and the gods.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 54–56}}  He was key to upholding Maat, both by maintaining justice and harmony in human society and by sustaining the gods with temples and offerings. For these reasons, he oversaw all state religious activity.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 5–6}}  However, the pharaoh's real-life influence and prestige could differ from his portrayal in official writings and depictions, and beginning in the late New Kingdom his religious importance declined drastically.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | p = 55}}&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, Jacobus, “The Amarna Period and the Later New Kingdom", in {{Harvnb | Shaw | 2000 | pp = 311–12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The king was also associated with many specific deities. He was identified directly with Horus, who represented kingship itself, and he was seen as the son of Ra, who ruled and regulated nature as the pharaoh ruled and regulated society.  By the New Kingdom he was also associated with Amun, the supreme force in the cosmos.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 69, 95, 184}}  Upon his death, the king became fully deified. In this state, he was directly identified with Ra, and was also associated with [[Osiris]], god of death and rebirth and the mythological father of Horus.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 60–63}}  Many mortuary temples were dedicated to the worship of deceased pharaohs as gods.&lt;ref name="Shafer 2"/&gt;

===Afterlife&lt;!--linked from 'Ancient Egyptian burial customs'--&gt;===
{{Main|Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs}}
The Egyptians had elaborate beliefs about death and the afterlife. They believed that humans possessed a ''[[Egyptian soul#Ka|ka]]'', or life-force, which left the body at the point of death. In life, the ''ka'' received its sustenance from food and drink, so it was believed that, to endure after death, the ''ka'' must continue to receive offerings of food, whose spiritual essence it could still consume. Each person also had a ''[[Egyptian soul#Ba|ba]]'', the set of spiritual characteristics unique to each individual.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 79–80}}  Unlike the ''ka'', the ''ba'' remained attached to the body after death. Egyptian funeral rituals were intended to release the ''ba'' from the body so that it could move freely, and to rejoin it with the ''ka'' so that it could live on as an ''[[Egyptian soul#Akh|akh]]''. However, it was also important that the body of the deceased be preserved, as the Egyptians believed that the ''ba'' returned to its body each night to receive new life, before emerging in the morning as an ''akh''.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 94–95}}

In early times the deceased pharaoh was believed to [[The Indestructibles#Cosmogony|ascend to the sky and dwell among the stars]].{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p = 25}}  Over the course of the [[Old Kingdom]] (c. 2686–2181 BC), however, he came to be more closely associated with the daily rebirth of the sun god [[Ra]] and with the underworld ruler [[Osiris]] as those deities grew more important.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 90, 94–95}}

===Judgment {{anchor |Weighing of the Heart}}===
In the fully developed afterlife beliefs of the New Kingdom, the soul had to avoid a variety of supernatural dangers in the [[Duat]], before undergoing a final judgment, known as the "Weighing of the Heart", carried out by Osiris and by the [[Assessors of Maat]]. In this judgment, the gods compared the actions of the deceased while alive (symbolized by the heart) to Maat, to determine whether he or she had behaved in accordance with Maat. If the deceased was judged worthy, his or her ''ka'' and ''ba'' were united into an ''akh''.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | p = 104}}  Several beliefs coexisted about the ''akh''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s destination. Often the dead were said to dwell in the realm of Osiris, a lush and pleasant land in the [[underworld]].{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 160–61}} The solar vision of the afterlife, in which the deceased soul traveled with Ra on his daily journey, was still primarily associated with royalty, but could extend to other people as well. Over the course of the Middle and New Kingdoms, the notion that the ''akh'' could also travel in the world of the living, and to some degree magically affect events there, became increasingly prevalent.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2005 | pp = 209–10, 398–402}}

==Writings==
{{see also|Ancient Egyptian literature}}
While the Egyptians had no unified religious scripture, they produced many religious writings of various types. Together the disparate texts provide a very extensive, but still incomplete, understanding of Egyptian religious practices and beliefs.{{Sfn | Traunecker | 2001 | pp = 1–5}}

===Mythology===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths]]--&gt;
{{main |Egyptian mythology}}
[[File:Book of Gates Barque of Ra cropped.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Ra]] (at center) travels through the underworld in his barque, accompanied by other gods{{Sfn |Wilkinson |2003 | pp = 222–223}}]]
Egyptian myths were metaphorical stories intended to illustrate and explain the gods' actions and roles in nature. The details of the events they recounted could change to convey different symbolic perspectives on the mysterious divine events they described, so many myths exist in different and conflicting versions.{{Sfn | Tobin | 2001 | pp = 464–68}}  Mythical narratives were rarely written in full, and more often texts only contain episodes from or allusions to a larger myth.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | p = 18}}  Knowledge of Egyptian mythology, therefore, is derived mostly from hymns that detail the roles of specific deities, from ritual and magical texts which describe actions related to mythic events, and from funerary texts which mention the roles of many deities in the afterlife. Some information is also provided by allusions in secular texts.{{Sfn | Traunecker | 2001 | pp = 1–5}}  Finally, Greeks and Romans such as [[Plutarch]] recorded some of the extant myths late in Egyptian history.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | p = 26}}

Among the significant Egyptian myths were the [[Ancient Egyptian creation myths|creation myths]]. According to these stories, the world emerged as a dry space in the primordial ocean of chaos.  Because the sun is essential to life on earth, the first rising of Ra marked the moment of this emergence. Different forms of the myth describe the process of creation in various ways: a transformation of the primordial god [[Atum]] into the elements that form the world, as the creative speech of the intellectual god [[Ptah]], and as an act of the hidden power of Amun.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 143–45, 171–73, 182}}  Regardless of these variations, the act of creation represented the initial establishment of maat and the pattern for the subsequent cycles of time.&lt;ref name="Shafer 2"/&gt;

The most important of all Egyptian myths was the [[myth of Osiris and Isis]].{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | p = 124}}  It tells of the divine ruler Osiris, who was murdered by his jealous brother [[Set (mythology)|Set]], a god often associated with chaos.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 76, 78}}  Osiris' sister and wife [[Isis]] resurrected him so that he could conceive an heir, Horus.  Osiris then entered the underworld and became the ruler of the dead.  Once grown, Horus fought and defeated Set to become king himself.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | p = 67}}  Set's association with chaos, and the identification of Osiris and Horus as the rightful rulers, provided a rationale for Pharaonic succession and portrayed the Pharaohs as the upholders of order.  At the same time, Osiris' death and rebirth were related to the Egyptian agricultural cycle, in which crops grew in the wake of the Nile inundation, and provided a template for the resurrection of human souls after death.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 84, 107–108}}

Another important mythic motif was the journey of Ra through the Duat each night. In the course of this journey, Ra met with Osiris, who again acted as an agent of regeneration, so that his life was renewed. He also fought each night with [[Apep]], a serpentine god representing chaos. The defeat of Apep and the meeting with Osiris ensured the rising of the sun the next morning, an event that represented rebirth and the victory of order over chaos.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 33, 38–39}}

===Ritual and magical texts===
The procedures for religious rituals were frequently written on papyri, which were used as instructions for those performing the ritual.  These ritual texts were kept mainly in the temple libraries. Temples themselves are also inscribed with such texts, often accompanied by illustrations. Unlike the ritual papyri, these inscriptions were not intended as instructions, but were meant to symbolically perpetuate the rituals even if, in reality, people ceased to perform them.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 93–99}}  Magical texts likewise describe rituals, although these rituals were part of the spells used for specific goals in everyday life. Despite their mundane purpose, many of these texts also originated in temple libraries and later became disseminated among the general populace.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | p = 63}}

===Hymns and prayers===
The Egyptians produced numerous prayers and hymns, written in the form of poetry. Hymns and prayers follow a similar structure and are distinguished mainly by the purposes they serve. Hymns were written to praise particular deities.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{Harvnb | Foster | 2001 | loc = vol. II, pp. 312–17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Like ritual texts, they were written on papyri and on temple walls, and they were probably recited as part of the rituals they accompany in temple inscriptions.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | p = 94}}  Most are structured according to a set literary formula, designed to expound on the nature, aspects, and mythological functions of a given deity.&lt;ref name="Foster"/&gt; They tend to speak more explicitly about fundamental theology than other Egyptian religious writings, and became particularly important in the New Kingdom, a period of particularly active theological discourse.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | p = 166}}  Prayers follow the same general pattern as hymns, but address the relevant god in a more personal way, asking for blessings, help, or forgiveness for wrongdoing. Such prayers are rare before the New Kingdom, indicating that in earlier periods such direct personal interaction with a deity was not believed possible, or at least was less likely to be expressed in writing. They are known mainly from inscriptions on statues and [[stelae]] left in sacred sites as [[votive offering]]s.&lt;ref name="Ockinga"&gt;Ockinga, Boyo, "Piety", in {{Harvnb | Redford | 2001 | loc = vol. III, pp. 44–46}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funerary texts===
{{main|Ancient Egyptian funerary texts}}
[[File:BD Hunefer cropped 1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Section of the Book of the Dead for the scribe [[Hunefer]], depicting the Weighing of the Heart.]]
Among the most significant and extensively preserved Egyptian writings are [[Ancient Egyptian funerary texts|funerary texts]] designed to ensure that deceased souls reached a pleasant afterlife.{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | p = 315}}  The earliest of these are the [[Pyramid Texts]]. They are a loose collection of hundreds of spells inscribed on the walls of royal pyramids during the Old Kingdom, intended to magically provide pharaohs with the means to join the company of the gods in the afterlife.{{Sfn | Hornung | 1999 | pp = 1–5}}  The spells appear in differing arrangements and combinations, and few of them appear in all of the pyramids.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 93}}

At the end of the Old Kingdom a new body of funerary spells, which included material from the Pyramid Texts, began appearing in tombs, inscribed primarily on coffins. This collection of writings is known as the [[Coffin Texts]], and was not reserved for royalty, but appeared in the tombs of non-royal officials.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 194–95}}  In the New Kingdom, several new funerary texts emerged, of which the best-known is the [[Book of the Dead]].  Unlike the earlier books, it often contains extensive illustrations, or vignettes.{{Sfn | Hornung | 1999 | pp = xvii, 14}}  The book was copied on papyrus and sold to commoners to be placed in their tombs.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | p = 98}}

The Coffin Texts included sections with detailed descriptions of the underworld and instructions on how to overcome its hazards. In the New Kingdom, this material gave rise to several "books of the netherworld", including the [[Book of Gates]], the [[Book of Caverns]], and the [[Amduat]].{{Sfn | Allen | 2000 | pp = 316–17}}  Unlike the loose collections of spells, these netherworld books are structured depictions of Ra's passage through the Duat, and by analogy, the journey of the deceased person's soul through the realm of the dead. They were originally restricted to pharaonic tombs, but in the Third Intermediate Period they came to be used more widely.{{Sfn | Hornung | 1999 | pp = 26–27, 30}}

==Practices==

===Temples===
{{main |Egyptian temple}}
Temples existed from the beginning of Egyptian history, and at the height of the civilization they were present in most of its towns. They included both mortuary temples to serve the spirits of deceased pharaohs and temples dedicated to patron gods, although the distinction was blurred because divinity and kingship were so closely intertwined.&lt;ref name= "Shafer 2"/&gt; The temples were not primarily intended as places for worship by the general populace, and the common people had a complex set of religious practices of their own. Instead, the state-run temples served as houses for the gods, in which physical images which served as their intermediaries were cared for and provided with offerings. This service was believed to be necessary to sustain the gods, so that they could in turn maintain the universe itself.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 42"&gt;{{Harvnb | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 42–44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, temples were central to Egyptian society, and vast resources were devoted to their upkeep, including both donations from the monarchy and large estates of their own.  Pharaohs often expanded them as part of their obligation to honor the gods, so that many temples grew to enormous size.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 8–9, 50}}  However, not all gods had temples dedicated to them, as many gods who were important in official theology received only minimal worship, and many household gods were the focus of popular veneration rather than temple ritual.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | p = 82}}

The earliest Egyptian temples were small, impermanent structures, but through the Old and Middle Kingdoms their designs grew more elaborate, and they were increasingly built out of stone. In the New Kingdom, a basic temple layout emerged, which had evolved from common elements in Old and Middle Kingdom temples. With variations, this plan was used for most of the temples built from then on, and most of those that survive today adhere to it. In this standard plan, the temple was built along a central processional way that led through a series of courts and halls to the sanctuary, which held a statue of the temple's god. Access to this most sacred part of the temple was restricted to the pharaoh and the highest-ranking priests. The journey from the temple entrance to the sanctuary was seen as a journey from the human world to the divine realm, a point emphasized by the complex mythological symbolism present in temple architecture.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 72–82, 86–89}}  Well beyond the temple building proper was the outermost wall. In the space between the two lay many subsidiary buildings, including workshops and storage areas to supply the temple's needs, and the library where the temple's sacred writings and mundane records were kept, and which also served as a center of learning on a multitude of subjects.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 72–75}}

Theoretically it was the duty of the pharaoh to carry out temple rituals, as he was Egypt's official representative to the gods. In reality, ritual duties were almost always carried out by priests. During the Old and Middle Kingdoms, there was no separate class of priests; instead, many government officials served in this capacity for several months out of the year before returning to their secular duties. Only in the New Kingdom did professional priesthood become widespread, although most lower-ranking priests were still part-time. All were still employed by the state, and the pharaoh had final say in their appointments.{{sfn|Shafer|1997|p=9}} However, as the wealth of the temples grew, the influence of their priesthoods increased, until it rivaled that of the pharaoh. In the political fragmentation of the [[Third Intermediate Period]] (c. 1070–664 BC), the high priests of Amun at Karnak even became the effective rulers of [[Upper Egypt]].{{sfn|Wilkinson|2000|pp= 9, 25–26}} The temple staff also included many people other than priests, such as musicians and chanters in temple ceremonies. Outside the temple were artisans and other laborers who helped supply the temple's needs, as well as farmers who worked on temple estates. All were paid with portions of the temple's income. Large temples were therefore very important centers of economic activity, sometimes employing thousands of people.{{sfn|Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 92–93}}

===Official rituals and festivals===
State religious practice included both temple rituals involved in the cult of a deity, and ceremonies related to divine kingship. Among the latter were [[coronation of the pharaoh|coronation ceremonies]] and the [[sed festival]], a ritual renewal of the pharaoh's strength that took place periodically during his reign.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Stephen E., "Cults: Overview", in Redford 2001, vol. I, 326–332&lt;/ref&gt; There were numerous temple rituals, including rites that took place across the country and rites limited to single temples or to the temples of a single god. Some were performed daily, while others took place annually or on rarer occasions.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 95"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson | 2000|p= 95}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common temple ritual was the morning offering ceremony, performed daily in temples across Egypt. In it, a high-ranking priest, or occasionally the pharaoh, washed, anointed, and elaborately dressed the god's statue before presenting it with offerings. Afterward, when the god had consumed the spiritual essence of the offerings, the items themselves were taken to be distributed among the priests.&lt;ref name="Thompson"/&gt;

The less frequent temple rituals, or festivals, were still numerous, with dozens occurring every year. These festivals often entailed actions beyond simple offerings to the gods, such as reenactments of particular myths or the symbolic destruction of the forces of disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunand|Zivie-Coche|2005|pp= 93–95}}; {{harvnb|Shafer| 1997| p= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these events were probably celebrated only by the priests and took place only inside the temple.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 95"/&gt; However, the most important temple festivals, like the [[Opet Festival]] celebrated at Karnak, usually involved a procession carrying the god's image out of the sanctuary in a model barque to visit other significant sites, such as the temple of a related deity. Commoners gathered to watch the procession and sometimes received portions of the unusually large offerings given to the gods on these occasions.{{sfn|Shafer| 1997| pp= 27–28}}

===Animal cults===
[[File:Apis bull on coffin.jpg|thumb|The Apis bull]]
At many sacred sites, the Egyptians worshipped individual animals which they believed to be manifestations of particular deities. These animals were selected based on specific sacred markings which were believed to indicate their fitness for the role. Some of these cult animals retained their positions for the rest of their lives, as with the [[Apis (Egyptian mythology)|Apis bull]] worshipped in Memphis as a manifestation of Ptah. Other animals were selected for much shorter periods. These cults grew more popular in later times, and many temples began raising stocks of such animals from which to choose a new divine manifestation.{{sfn|Dunand|Zivie-Coche |2005| pp =  21, 83}} A separate practice developed in the [[Twenty-sixth Dynasty]], when people began mummifying any member of a particular animal species as an offering to the god whom the species represented. Millions of mummified [[cat]]s, birds, and other creatures were buried at temples honoring Egyptian deities.{{sfn|Quirke | Spencer| 1992| pp = 78, 92–94}}&lt;ref name=Owen2004&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Egyptian Animals Were Mummified Same Way as Humans| url = https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/09/0915_040915_petmummies.html| year = 2004| author = Owen, James| journal = National Geographic News| accessdate = 2010-08-06| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Worshippers paid the priests of a particular deity to obtain and mummify an animal associated with that deity, and the mummy was placed in a cemetery near the god's cult center.

===Oracles===
The Egyptians used [[oracle]]s to ask the gods for knowledge or guidance. Egyptian oracles are known mainly from the New Kingdom and afterward, though they probably appeared much earlier. People of all classes, including the king, asked questions of oracles, and, especially in the late New Kingdom their answers could be used to settle legal disputes or inform royal decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Kruchten, Jean-Marie, "Oracles", in {{harvnb|Redford| 2001| pp= 609–611}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common means of consulting an oracle was to pose a question to the divine image while it was being carried in a festival procession, and interpret an answer from the barque's movements. Other methods included interpreting the behavior of cult animals, drawing lots, or consulting statues through which a priest apparently spoke. The means of discerning the god's will gave great influence to the priests who spoke and interpreted the god's message.{{sfn|Frankfurter| 1998| pp= 145–152}}

===Popular religion===
While the state cults were meant to preserve the stability of the Egyptian world, lay individuals had their own religious practices that related more directly to daily life.{{sfn|Sadek| 1988| pp= 1–2}} This popular religion left less evidence than the official cults, and because this evidence was mostly produced by the wealthiest portion of the Egyptian population, it is uncertain to what degree it reflects the practices of the populace as a whole.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 46"&gt;{{harvnb|Wilkinson| 2003| pp= 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular religious practice included ceremonies marking important transitions in life. These included birth, because of the danger involved in the process, and [[naming ceremony|naming]], because the name was held to be a crucial part of a person's identity. The most important of these ceremonies were those surrounding death (see "Funerary practices" below), because they ensured the soul's survival beyond it.{{sfn|Dunand | Zivie-Coche| 2005| pp= 128–131}} Other religious practices sought to discern the gods' will or seek their knowledge. These included the interpretation of dreams, which could be seen as messages from the divine realm, and the consultation of oracles. People also sought to affect the gods' behavior to their own benefit through magical rituals (see "Magic" below).&lt;ref&gt;Baines, in {{harvnb|Shafer| 1991| pp= 164–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual Egyptians also prayed to gods and gave them private offerings. Evidence of this type of personal piety is sparse before the New Kingdom. This is probably due to cultural restrictions on depiction of nonroyal religious activity, which relaxed during the Middle and New Kingdoms. Personal piety became still more prominent in the late New Kingdom, when it was believed that the gods intervened directly in individual lives, punishing wrongdoers and saving the pious from disaster.&lt;ref name="Ockinga"/&gt; Official temples were important venues for private prayer and offering, even though their central activities were closed to laypeople. Egyptians frequently donated goods to be offered to the temple deity and objects inscribed with prayers to be placed in temple courts. Often they prayed in person before temple statues or in shrines set aside for their use.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson 46"/&gt; Yet in addition to temples, the populace also used separate local chapels, smaller but more accessible than the formal temples. These chapels were very numerous, and probably staffed by members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Lesko, Barbara S. "Cults: Private Cults", in Redford 2001, vol. I, pp. 336–339&lt;/ref&gt; Households, too, often had their own small shrines for offering to gods or deceased relatives.{{sfn|Sadek |1988| pp= 76–78}}

The deities invoked in these situations differed somewhat from those at the center of state cults. Many of the important popular deities, such as the fertility goddess [[Taweret]] and the household protector [[Bes]], had no temples of their own. However, many other gods, including Amun and Osiris, were very important in both popular and official religion.{{sfn|David| 2002| pp= 273, 276–277}} Some individuals might be particularly devoted to a single god. Often they favored deities affiliated with their own region, or with their role in life. The god [[Ptah]], for instance, was particularly important in his cult center of [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]], but as the patron of craftsmen he received the nationwide veneration of many in that occupation.{{sfn|Traunecker| 2001| p= 98}}

===Magic===
{{main|Heka_(god)|l1=Heka}}
[[File:Wedjat (Udjat) Eye of Horus pendant.jpg|thumb|Amulet in the shape of the [[Eye of Horus]], a common magical symbol]]
The word "magic" could be used to translate the Egyptian term ''heka'', which meant, as [[James P. Allen]] puts it, "the ability to make things happen by indirect means".{{sfn|Allen| 2000| pp= 156–157}} Heka was believed to be a natural phenomenon, the force which was used to create the universe and which the gods employed to work their will. Humans could also use it, however, and magical practices were closely intertwined with religion. In fact, even the regular rituals performed in temples were counted as magic.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 9–17}}  Individuals also frequently employed magical techniques for personal purposes.  Although these ends could be harmful to other people, no form of magic was considered inimical in itself.  Instead, magic was seen primarily as a way for humans to prevent or overcome negative events.&lt;ref&gt;Baines, in {{Harvnb | Shafer | 1991 | p = 165}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Magic was closely associated with the priesthood. Because temple libraries contained numerous magical texts, great magical knowledge was ascribed to the lector priests who studied these texts. These priests often worked outside their temples, hiring out their magical services to laymen. Other professions also commonly employed magic as part of their work, including doctors, scorpion-charmers, and makers of magical amulets.  It is also likely that the peasantry used simple magic for their own purposes, but because this magical knowledge would have been passed down orally, there is limited evidence of it.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 51–63}}

Language was closely linked with heka, to such a degree that [[Thoth]], the god of writing, was sometimes said to be the inventor of heka.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 16, 28}}  Therefore, magic frequently involved written or spoken incantations, although these were usually accompanied by ritual actions. Often these rituals invoked the power of an appropriate deity to perform the desired action, using the power of heka to compel it to act. Sometimes this entailed casting the practitioner or subject of a ritual in the role of a character in mythology, thus inducing the god to act toward that person as it had in the myth. Rituals also employed [[sympathetic magic]], using objects believed to have a magically significant resemblance to the subject of the rite. The Egyptians also commonly used objects believed to be imbued with heka of their own, such as the magically protective [[amulet]]s worn in great numbers by ordinary Egyptians.{{Sfn | Pinch | 1995 | pp = 73–78}}

===Funerary practices===
{{main |Ancient Egyptian funerary practices}}
Because it was considered necessary for the survival of the soul, preservation of the body was a central part of Egyptian funerary practices. Originally the Egyptians buried their dead in the desert, where the arid conditions [[mummified]] the body naturally. In the Early Dynastic Period, however, they began using tombs for greater protection, and the body was insulated from the [[desiccation|desiccating]] effect of the sand and was subject to natural decay. Thus the Egyptians developed their elaborate [[embalming]] practices, in which the corpse was artificially desiccated and wrapped to be placed in its coffin.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | pp = 86–90}}  The quality of the process varied according to cost, however, and those who could not afford it were still buried in desert graves.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 300–1}}

[[File:Opening of the mouth ceremony.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Opening of the Mouth ceremony being performed before the tomb]]
Once the mummification process was complete, the mummy was carried from the deceased person's house to the tomb in a funeral procession that included his or her friends and relatives, along with a variety of priests. Before the burial, these priests performed several rituals, including the [[Opening of the mouth ceremony]] intended to restore the dead person's senses and give him or her the ability to receive offerings. Then the mummy was buried and the tomb sealed.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 187–93}}  Afterward, relatives or hired priests gave food offerings to the deceased in a nearby mortuary chapel at regular intervals.  Over time, families inevitably neglected offerings to long-dead relatives, so most mortuary cults only lasted one or two generations.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | p = 95}}  However, while the cult lasted, the living sometimes wrote letters asking deceased relatives for help, in the belief that the dead could affect the world of the living as the gods did.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 282}}

The first Egyptian tombs were [[mastaba]]s, rectangular brick structures where kings and nobles were entombed. Each of them contained a subterranean burial chamber and a separate, above ground chapel for mortuary rituals. In the Old Kingdom the mastaba developed into the [[pyramid]], which symbolized the primeval mound of Egyptian myth. Pyramids were reserved for royalty, and were accompanied by large mortuary temples sitting at their base. Middle Kingdom pharaohs continued to build pyramids, but the popularity of mastabas waned.  Increasingly, commoners with sufficient means were buried in rock-cut tombs with separate mortuary chapels nearby, an approach which was less vulnerable to tomb robbery.  By the beginning of the New Kingdom even the pharaohs were buried in such tombs, and they continued to be used until the decline of the religion itself.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 141–55}}

Tombs could contain a great variety of other items, including statues of the deceased to serve as substitutes for the body in case it was damaged.{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 100–1}}  Because it was believed that the deceased would have to do work in the afterlife, just as in life, burials often included small models of humans to do work in place of the deceased.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 99–103}}  The tombs of wealthier individuals could also contain furniture, clothing, and other everyday objects intended for use in the afterlife, along with amulets and other items intended to provide magical protection against the hazards of the spirit world.{{Sfn | Taylor | 2001 | pp = 107–10, 200–13}}  Further protection was provided by funerary texts included in the burial. The tomb walls also bore artwork, including images of the deceased eating food which were believed to allow him or her to magically receive sustenance even after the mortuary offerings had ceased.{{Sfn | Quirke | Spencer | 1992 | pp = 97–98, 112}}

==History==

===Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods===
[[File:Narmer-Tjet2.JPG|thumb|[[Narmer]], a Predynastic ruler, accompanied by men carrying the standards of various local gods]]
The beginnings of Egyptian religion extend into prehistory, though evidence for them comes only from the sparse and ambiguous archaeological record. Careful burials during the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic period]] imply that the people of this time believed in some form of an afterlife. At the same time, animals were ritually buried, a practice which may reflect the development of [[zoomorphism|zoomorphic]] deities like those found in the later religion.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 12–15}}  The evidence is less clear for gods in human form, and this type of deity may have emerged more slowly than those in animal shape. Each region of Egypt originally had its own patron deity, but it is likely that as these small communities conquered or absorbed each other, the god of the defeated area was either incorporated into the other god's mythology or entirely subsumed by it. This resulted in a complex pantheon in which some deities remained only locally important while others developed more universal significance.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | p = 31}}{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 50–52}}

The [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period]] began with the unification of Egypt around 3000&amp;nbsp;BC. This event transformed Egyptian religion, as some deities rose to national importance and the cult of the divine pharaoh became the central focus of religious activity.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | p = 15}}  Horus was identified with the king, and his cult center in the Upper Egyptian city of [[Nekhen]] was among the most important religious sites of the period. Another important center was [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]], where the early rulers built large funerary complexes.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2000 | pp = 17–19}}

===Old and Middle Kingdoms===
During the Old Kingdom, the priesthoods of the major deities attempted to organize the complicated national pantheon into groups linked by their mythology and worshipped in a single cult center, such as the [[Ennead]] of [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] which linked important deities such as [[Atum]], Ra, Osiris, and [[Set (mythology)|Set]] in a single creation myth.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 51, 81–85}}  Meanwhile, pyramids, accompanied by large mortuary temple complexes, replaced [[mastabas]] as the tombs of pharaohs. In contrast with the great size of the pyramid complexes, temples to gods remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized the cult of the divine king more than the direct worship of deities. The funerary rituals and architecture of this time greatly influenced the more elaborate temples and rituals used in worshipping the gods in later periods.{{Sfn | Dunand | Zivie-Coche | 2005 | pp = 78–79}}

[[File:Pyramide Djedkare elevation.jpg|thumb|left|The pyramid complex of [[Djedkare Isesi]]]]
Early in the Old Kingdom, Ra grew in influence, and his cult center at Heliopolis became the nation's most important religious site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Malek | 2000 | pp = 92–93, 108–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  By the Fifth Dynasty, Ra was the most prominent god in Egypt, and had developed the close links with kingship and the afterlife that he retained for the rest of Egyptian history.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 90–91, 112}}  Around the same time, [[Osiris]] became an important afterlife deity. ''The Pyramid Texts,'' first written at this time, reflect the prominence of the solar and Osirian concepts of the afterlife, although they also contain remnants of much older traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb | Malek | 2000 | p = 113}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The texts are an extremely important source for understanding early Egyptian theology.{{sfn|David| 2002| p= 92}}

In the 22nd century BC, the Old Kingdom collapsed into the disorder of the First Intermediate Period. Eventually rulers from Thebes reunified the Egyptian nation in the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (c. 2055–1650 BC). These Theban pharaohs initially promoted their patron god [[Montu]] to national importance, but during the Middle Kingdom, he was eclipsed by the rising popularity of [[Amun]].{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 154}}  In this new Egyptian state, personal piety grew more important and was expressed more freely in writing, a trend which continued in the New Kingdom.&lt;ref name = "Shaw 180"&gt;Callender, Gae, "The Middle Kingdom", in {{Harvnb | Shaw | 2000 | pp = 180–81}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Kingdom===
The Middle Kingdom crumbled in the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]] (c. 1650–1550 BC), but the country was again reunited by Theban rulers, who became the first pharaohs of the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]. Under the new regime, [[Amun]] became the supreme state god. He was syncretized with Ra, the long-established patron of kingship, and his [[Precinct of Amun-Ra|temple at Karnak]] in Thebes became Egypt's most important religious center.  Amun's elevation was partly due to the great importance of Thebes, but it was also due to the increasingly professional priesthood. Their sophisticated theological discussion produced detailed descriptions of Amun's universal power.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 181–84, 186}}{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | pp = 166, 191–92}}

Increased contact with outside peoples in this period led to the adoption of many Near Eastern deities into the pantheon. At the same time, the subjugated [[Nubia]]ns absorbed Egyptian religious beliefs, and in particular, adopted Amun as their own.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 276, 304}}

[[File:La salle dAkhenaton (1356-1340 av J.C.) (Musée du Caire) (2076972086).jpg|right|thumb|Akhenaten and his family worshipping the Aten]]
The New Kingdom religious order was disrupted when [[Akhenaten]] acceded, and replaced Amun with the [[Aten]] as the state god. Eventually he eliminated the official worship of most other gods, and moved Egypt's capital to a new city at [[Amarna]]. This part of Egyptian history, the [[Amarna period]], is named after this.  In doing so, Akhenaten claimed unprecedented status: only he could worship the Aten, and the populace directed their worship toward him. The Atenist system lacked well-developed mythology and afterlife beliefs, and the Aten seemed distant and impersonal, so the new order did not appeal to ordinary Egyptians.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 215–18, 238}}  Thus, many probably continued to worship the traditional gods in private. Nevertheless, the withdrawal of state support for the other deities severely disrupted Egyptian society.{{Sfn | Van Dijk | 2000 | pp = 287, 311}}  Akhenaten's successors restored the traditional religious system, and eventually they dismantled all Atenist monuments.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 238–39}}

Before the Amarna period, popular religion had trended toward more personal relationships between worshippers and their gods. Akhenaten's changes had reversed this trend, but once the traditional religion was restored, there was a backlash. The populace began to believe that the gods were much more directly involved in daily life. Amun, the supreme god, was increasingly seen as the final arbiter of human destiny, the true ruler of Egypt. The pharaoh was correspondingly more human and less divine. The importance of oracles as a means of decision-making grew, as did the wealth and influence of the oracles' interpreters, the priesthood. These trends undermined the traditional structure of society and contributed to the breakdown of the New Kingdom.{{Sfn | Van Dijk | 2000 | pp = 289, 310–12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Assmann | title = State and Religion in the New Kingdom}}, in {{Harvnb | Simpson | 1989 | pp = 72–79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later periods===
{{further|Decline of ancient Egyptian religion}}
In the 1st millennium BC, Egypt was significantly weaker than in earlier times, and in several periods foreigners seized the country and assumed the position of pharaoh. The importance of the pharaoh continued to decline, and the emphasis on popular piety continued to increase. Animal cults, a characteristically Egyptian form of worship, became increasingly popular in this period, possibly as a response to the uncertainty and foreign influence of the time.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 312–17}}  Isis grew more popular as a goddess of protection, magic, and personal salvation, and became the most important goddess in Egypt.{{Sfn | Wilkinson | 2003 | pp = 51, 146–49}}

[[File:Serapis Pio-Clementino Inv689.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Serapis]]
In the 4th century BC, Egypt became a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] kingdom under the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] (305–30 BC), which assumed the pharaonic role, maintaining the traditional religion and building or rebuilding many temples. The kingdom's Greek ruling class identified the Egyptian deities with their own.{{Sfn | Peacock | 2000 | pp = 437–38}}  From this cross-cultural syncretism emerged [[Serapis]], a god who combined Osiris and Apis with characteristics of Greek deities, and who became very popular among the Greek population. Nevertheless, for the most part the two belief systems remained separate, and the Egyptian deities remained Egyptian.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | pp = 325–28}}

Ptolemaic-era beliefs changed little after Egypt became a [[Egypt (Roman province)|province]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in 30 BC, with the Ptolemaic kings replaced by distant emperors.{{Sfn | Peacock | 2000 | pp = 437–38}}  The cult of Isis appealed even to Greeks and Romans outside Egypt, and in Hellenized form it spread across the empire.{{Sfn | David | 2002 | p = 326}}  In Egypt itself, as the empire weakened, official temples fell into decay, and without their centralizing influence religious practice became fragmented and localized. Meanwhile, [[Christianity]] spread across Egypt, and in the third and fourth centuries AD, edicts by Christian emperors and [[iconoclasm]] by local Christians eroded traditional beliefs. While it persisted among the populace for some time, Egyptian religion slowly faded away.{{Sfn | Frankfurter | 1998 | pp = 23–30}}

===Legacy===
[[File:Th oltar.JPG|thumb|200px|Altar to [[Thoth]] of a [[Kemetism|Kemetic]] follower.]]
Egyptian religion produced the temples and tombs which are ancient Egypt's most enduring monuments, but it also influenced other cultures. In pharaonic times many of its symbols, such as the [[sphinx]] and [[winged sun|winged solar disk]], were adopted by other cultures across the Mediterranean and Near East, as were some of its deities, such as [[Bes]].  Some of these connections are difficult to trace.  The Greek concept of [[Elysium]] may have derived from the Egyptian vision of the afterlife.{{Sfn | Assmann | 2001 | p = 392}}  In late antiquity, the Christian conception of [[Hell]] was most likely influenced by some of the imagery of the Duat. Egyptian beliefs also influenced or gave rise to several [[esotericism|esoteric]] belief systems developed by Greeks and Romans, who considered Egypt as a source of mystic wisdom. [[Hermeticism]], for instance, derived from the tradition of secret magical knowledge associated with [[Thoth]].{{Sfn | Hornung | 2001 | pp = 1, 9–11, 73–75}}

====Modern times====
Traces of ancient beliefs remained in Egyptian folk traditions into modern times, but its influence on modern societies greatly increased with the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria]] in 1798 and their seeing the monuments and images. As a result of it, Westerners began to study Egyptian beliefs firsthand, and Egyptian religious motifs were adopted into Western art.{{Sfn | Hornung | 2001 | p = 75}}{{Sfn | Fleming | Lothian | 1997 | pp = 133–36}}  Egyptian religion has since had a significant [[Egyptian influence in popular culture|influence in popular culture]]. Due to continued interest in Egyptian beliefs, in the late 20th century, several new religious groups going under the blanket term of [[Kemetism]] have formed based on different reconstructions of ancient Egyptian religion.{{Sfn | Melton | 2009 | pp = 841, 847, 851, 855}}

'''Arabi-Malayalam''' ([[Malayalam script|Malayalam]]: &lt;small&gt;അറബി-മലയാളം&lt;/small&gt;, Arabi Malayalam: عَرَبِ-مَلَیَاۻَمٛ) is a writing system - a variant form of the [[Arabic script]] with special [[orthography|orthographic]] features - for writing [[Malayalam]], a Dravidian language in southern India.&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Malayalam Resource Centre [https://archive.is/20120912185758/http://www.malayalamresourcecentre.org/Mrc/literature/contribution.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the script originated and developed in South India, today it is predominantly used in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] by the migrant Muslim community. &lt;ref name="Arabic script for malayalam" /&gt; 

Until the 20th century, the script was widely taught to all Muslims - including young women - in the primary education madrasahs of Kerala.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Menon. T. Madhava.

There were many complications to write Malayalam, a Dravidian language, using letters covering Arabic, a Semitic language. Only 28 letters were available from Arabic orthography to render over 53 phonemes of Malayalam. It was overcome by following the pattern of creating additional letters established for Persian.&lt;ref&gt;Arabi-Malayalam - "E-Malabari" [https://web.archive.org/web/20080318235926/http://www.e-malabari.net/culture/arabimalayalam.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The letters such as {{lang|ml-Latn|pa}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|gha}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|kha}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ṅa}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ña}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ḻa}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ga}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ca}} were not available in the Arabic alphabets. The characters which stand for {{lang|ml-Latn|ḻa}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ca}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|pa}}, {{lang|ml-Latn|ga}} ({{lang|ml|ഴ, ച, പ, ഗ}}) are {{lang|ml-Arab|&lt;!--LRO--&gt;ژ, چ, پ, گ&lt;!--PDF--&gt;|rtl=yes}} respectively in Arabi Malayalam.

Most of the [[Mappila Songs]] were written, for the first time, in Arabi-Malayalam script. The earliest known such work is the ''Muhyidheen Mala'', written in 1607.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arabic script for malayalam" /&gt;
[[File:ArabiMalayalam.jpg|thumb|500px|right|An Arabi Malayalam newspaper called "Al Bayan newspaper" (March 1930)]]
A large number of literary works written in Arabi Malayalam still have not been transliterated to the Malayalam script, and some estimates put the number at almost 90 percent. These works, romantic ballads, folk tales and battle songs, contain some of the impressive literary achievements by [[Mappila]]s over the centuries.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller, Roland. E., "Mappila" in "The Encyclopedia of Islam". Volume VI. E. J. Brill, Leiden. 1987. pp. 458-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Arabi Malayalam scripted novel, ''Chahar Dervesh'', Malaylam translation of a Persian work, was published in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Sharafudeen, S. "Muslims of Kerala: a Modern Approach, "Kerala Historical Society, 2003. pp. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Intellectuals such as [[Moyinkutty Vaidyar]] translated, and then transliterated significant number of works in Sanskrit - such as ''[[Ashtānga Hridayam|Ashtanga Hridaya]], [[Amarakosha|Amarakosa]], [[Panchatantra|Pancatantra]]'' and even the legends about the Hindu king [[Vikramaditya]] - into Arabi Malayalam.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;"Malayalam Literary Survey", Volume 16 (1) -17 (4), Kēraḷa Sāhitya Akkādami, 1994. pp. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Sanskrit medical texts - such as ''Upakarasara'', ''Yogarambha'' and ''Mahasara'' - were also translated, and then transliterated into Arabi-Malayalam by scholars like Abdurahiman Musaliar of [[Ponnani]] Putiyakattu.&lt;ref name="survey"/&gt; Arabi Malayalam script periodicals made remarkable contributions to the reform movement amongst the Mappilas in the early 20th century. ''Al-Irshad'', published in 1923 by the ''Muslim Aikya Sangham'' played an important role in explaining the doctrines of Islam to the common Mappila and distinguishing between what the reformers called religious practices and "superstitions".&lt;ref&gt;"Journal of Kerala Studies", Volume 17, University of Kerala, 1990. pp. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arnold Potter''' (January 11, 1804 – April 2, 1872) was a self-declared [[Messiah]] and a leader of a schismatic sect in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]]. Potter referred to himself as '''Potter Christ'''.

==Biography==
Potter was born in [[Herkimer County, New York]]. At age 19, he married Almira Smith. By 1835 Potter had moved with his wife and children to [[Switzerland County, Indiana]]. On November 10, 1839, Potter and his family were [[Baptism in Mormonism|baptized]] by [[Mormon missionary|missionaries]] of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]].

In April 1840, Potter and his family moved to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], to join the main gathering of Latter Day Saints. On April 24, 1840, Potter was given the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] and ordained to the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] office of [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] by [[Joseph Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/license-for-arnold-potter-24-april-1840/1|title=License for Arnold Potter, 24 April 1840, Page 36|website=www.josephsmithpapers.org|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1, 1840, Potter received a [[patriarchal blessing]] from church [[Presiding Patriarch|patriarch]] [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] Potter settled in [[Sand Prairie, Iowa]], where he was the presiding elder of the church. In January 1845, Potter became a [[Seventy (Latter Day Saints)|seventy]] in the church.

In 1848, Potter traveled to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] as a [[Mormon pioneer]]. By 1856, he had moved from [[Utah Territory]] to [[San Bernardino, California]]. On March 16, 1856, Potter received a call to serve as a missionary in [[Australia]] from [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|LDS Church president]] [[Brigham Young]]. Later that year, Potter left California for Australia on the ship ''Osprey''.

Potter later claimed that during his trip to Australia, he underwent a "purifying, quickening change" whereby his own spiritual body, called "Christ", entered into his body and he became "Potter Christ, Son of the living God". During his time in Australia, Potter wrote a book which he said was dictated to him by [[angel]]s; it was described by Potter as the book from which all people were to be judged at the [[Final Judgment]].

Potter returned to California by October 1857. A Latter-day Saint observer described Potter's re-appearance in the community:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wednesday 21 October 1857—Arnold Potter, who calls himself Potter Christ, appeared in our streets today with a brand on his forehead which had been put in with India ink. The words which can be read at quite a distance, are "Potter Christ—The Living God—Morning Star". To the right of the inscription is a star, below a cross. He appears very desirous of winning followers. It is said there are several apostates about to join him.&lt;ref&gt;''Manuscript History of the San Bernardino Settlement'', LDS Church archives.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1861, Potter and some of his followers had left California with the intention of settling near [[Independence, Missouri]], the traditional location of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]] for the Latter Day Saints. They settled at Saint Marys in northwest [[Mills County, Iowa]]. When Saint Marys was destroyed by flooding in 1865, they moved to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. Potter spent his days wandering the streets in Council Bluffs wearing a long white robe and became a local oddity. Potter's followers in Council Bluffs were described as "few but devout". The men wore black robes and the women eschewed normal grooming practices. Potter and his followers held enthusiastic [[prayer meeting]]s which would often culminate in Potter declaring a new [[revelation]] from God.

In 1872, Potter announced at a meeting of his church that the time had come for his [[Entering heaven alive|ascent into heaven]]. Followed by his disciples, Potter rode a donkey to the edge of the bluffs, whereupon he leapt off the edge intending to "ascend," but instead fell to his death. His body was collected and buried by his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= James |last= Barnes |title= Unveiling of the Middleman: The Truth About Prophecy |publisher= [[AuthorHouse]] |year= 2011 |pages= 63–64 |type= [[self-published]] |isbn= 9781456723835 |oclc= 705264070 }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Atheism in Christianity''''' ({{lang-de|Atheismus im Christentum}}) is a 1968 book by Marxist philosopher [[Ernst Bloch]].&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=nh/&gt; The book offers a third way to the Christian/atheist either/or debate. Gareth Jenkins from Socialist Review says that Bloch "argues that there are liberatory, 'atheist' elements within Christianity with which socialists should make common cause."&lt;ref name=sr/&gt;

'''Baal''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|eɪ|əl|,_|ˈ|b|ɑː|əl}}),&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1885), "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14174 Baal, ''n.'']"&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The [[American English|American pronunciation]] is usually the same&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionaries'' (2015), "[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/american_english/Baal Baal]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mwo/&gt; but some speakers prefer variants closer to the original sound, such as {{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|ˈ|ɑː|l}} or {{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|l}}.&lt;ref name=mwo&gt;''Merriam-Webster Online'' (2015), "[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/baal baal]".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Webb's Easy Bible Names Pronunciation Guide'' (2012), "[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=IrrtAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT36 Baal]".&lt;/ref&gt;}} properly '''Baʿal''',{{efn|{{lang-uga|{{linktext|𐎁𐎓𐎍}}}};{{sfnp|De Moor &amp; al.|1987|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=fu_Y5qnoCpAC&amp;pg=PA1 1]}} {{lang-phn|{{linktext|𐤁𐤏𐤋}}}};&lt;!--right-to-left--&gt; {{lang-hbo|{{linktext|בעל}}}}, {{IPA-he|baʕal|pron}}).}} was a title and [[honorific]] meaning "owner," "[[lord]]" in the [[Northwest Semitic languages]] spoken in the [[Levant]] during [[Ancient Near East|antiquity]]. From its use among people, it came to be applied to gods.{{sfnp|Smith|1878|pp=175–176}} Scholars previously associated the [[theonym]] with [[solar god|solar cults]] and with a variety of unrelated [[patron deity|patron deities]], but inscriptions have shown that the name Baʿal was particularly associated with the [[storm god|storm]] and [[fertility god]] [[Hadad]] and his local manifestations.{{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc="Baal (Deity)"}}

The [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Masoretic Text|compiled]] and [[development of the Hebrew Bible canon|curated]] over a span of centuries, includes generic use of the term in reference to various Levantine deities, and finally pointed application towards [[Hadad]], who was decried as a [[false god]]. That use was taken over into [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]], sometimes under the opprobrious form [[Beelzebub]] in [[demonology]].

{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}

==Etymology==
The spelling of the English term "Baal" derives from the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] ''Báal'' ({{lang|grc|Βάαλ}}), which appears in the [[New Testament]]&lt;ref&gt;Romans 11:4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Septuagint]],{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} and from its [[latinization of names|Latinized]] form ''{{lang|la|Baal}}'', which appears in the [[Vulgate]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} These forms in turn derive from the vowel-less Northwest Semitic form {{sc|bʿl}} ([[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] &amp; {{lang-xpu|{{linktext|𐤁𐤏𐤋}}‬}}).{{sfnp|Huss|1985|p=[https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=NvEK7kc3qnQC&amp;pg=PA561 561]}} The word's [[Bible|biblical]] senses as a Phoenician deity and [[false god]]s generally were extended during the [[Protestant Reformation]] to denote any [[idolatry|idols]], [[icon]]s of the [[saint (Christianity)|saint]]s, or the [[Catholic Church]] generally.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (1885), "[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14177 Baalist, ''n.'']"&lt;/ref&gt; In such contexts, it follows the anglicized pronunciation and usually omits any mark between its two As.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt; In close transliteration of the Semitic name, the [[ayin]] is represented, as ''Baʿal''.

In the [[Northwest Semitic languages]]—[[Ugaritic]], [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Amorite language|Amorite]], and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]—the word ''baʿal'' signified "[[property|owner]]" and, by extension, "lord",{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} a "master", or "husband".{{sfnp|Pope|2006}}{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc="[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]"}} 
Cognates include the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''[[Bel (mythology)|Bēlu]]'' ({{lang|akk|{{linktext|𒂗}}}}),{{efn|This [[cuneiform]] is identical to the {{nowrap|{{angle bracket| [[𒂗]] }}}} which is taken as EN in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] texts. There, it has the meaning "[[high priest (Sumer)|high priest]]" or "lord" and appears in the names of the gods [[Enki]] and [[Enlil]].}} [[Amharic language|Amharic]] ''bal'' ({{lang|am|{{linktext|ባል}}}}),{{sfnp|Kane|1990|p=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=H6tnix8o0mwC&amp;pg=PA861 861]}} and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] ''baʿl'' ({{lang|ar|{{linktext|بَعْل}}}}). ''Báʿal'' ({{lang|he|בַּעַל}}) and ''baʿl'' still serve as the words for "husband" in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] respectively. They also appear in some contexts concerning the ownership of things or possession of traits.

The feminine form is ''baʿalah'' ({{lang-he|[[wikt:בעלה|בַּעֲלָה]]}};{{sfnp|Strong|1890|loc=[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H1172 H1172]}} {{lang-ar|بَعْلَة}}), meaning "mistress" in the sense of a female owner or lady of the house{{sfnp|Strong|1890|loc=[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H1172 H1172]}} and still serving as a rare word for "[[wife]]".{{sfnp|Wehr &amp; al.|1976|p=67}}

Suggestions in early modern scholarship also included comparison with the Celtic god [[Belenus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ch/books?id=TsD281UZGhwC&amp;pg=PA174 Belin], in
Gilles Ménage, ''Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue françoise'', 1750.
Ménage constructs a derivation of both the "Chaldean" Bel and the Celtic Belin
from a supposed word for "ball, sphere", whence "head", and "chief, lord".&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[𒂗|EN]] in [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''bēlu'' and [[Northwest Semitic languages|Northwest Semitic]] ''baʿal'' (as well as its feminine form ''baʿalah'') was used as a title of various deities in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian religion|Mesopotamian]] and [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic pantheons]]. Only a [[definitive article]], [[genitive]] or [[epithet]], or context could establish which particular god was meant.{{sfnp|Halpern|2009|p=64}}

===Hadad===
{{Main|Hadad|Adad}}
Baʿal was also used as a proper name by the third millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, when he appears in a list of deities at [[Abu Salabikh]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} Most modern scholarship asserts that this Baʿal—usually distinguished as "The Lord" ({{lang|he|[[wikt:ה־|ה]]{{linktext|בעל}}}}, ''Ha Baʿal'')—was identical with the [[storm god|storm]] and [[fertility god]] [[Hadad]];{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}}{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=68}}{{sfnp|Pope|2006}} it also appears in the form ''Baʿal Haddu''.{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc="[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]"}}{{sfnp|Ayali-Darshan|2013|p=652}} Scholars propose that, as the cult of Hadad increased in importance, his true name came to be seen as too holy for any but the high priest to speak aloud and the alias "Lord" ("Baʿal") was used instead, as "[[Bel (god)|Bel]]" was used for [[Marduk]] among the Babylonians and "[[Adonai]]" for [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]] among the Israelites. A minority propose that Baʿal was a native [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] deity whose cult was identified with or absorbed aspects of [[Adad]]'s.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} Regardless of their original relationship, by the 1st millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, the two were distinct: Hadad was worshipped by the [[Aramaeans]] and Baʿal by the [[Phoenicians]] and other [[Canaanites]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}}

===El===
{{hatnote|Main: [[El (god)|El]]}}
The [[Phoenician religion|Phoenician]] Baʿal is generally identified with either [[El (god)|El]] or [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Decker |first=Roy |contribution=Carthaginian Religion |contribution-url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/uc_decker_carthrel2.htm |title=Ancient/Classical History |publisher=[[About.com]] |date=2001 |location=New York |p=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baʿal===
{{See also|Baal Cycle}}

Baʿal is well-attested in surviving inscriptions and was popular in [[theophoric name]]s throughout the Levant{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}} but he is usually mentioned along with other gods, "his own field of action being seldom defined".{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}} Nonetheless, Ugaritic records show him as a [[weather god]], with particular power over [[lightning god|lightning]], [[wind god|wind]], [[rain god|rain]], and [[fertility god|fertility]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}}{{efn|In surviving accounts, Baʿal's power over fertility extends only over vegetation. Older scholarship claimed Baʿal controlled human fertility as well, but did so on the basis of misinterpretation or of inscriptions now regarded as dubious.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|pp=134–135}} Similarly, 19th-century scholarship treating Baal as a [[anthropomorphism|personification]] of the [[sun]] seems to have been badly taken. The [[astrotheology]] of Near Eastern deities was an [[Iron Age]] development long postdating the [[origin of religion]] and, following its development, [[Bel (god)|Bel]] and Baʿal were associated with the planet [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]].{{sfnp|Smith &amp; al.|1899}} The sun was worshipped in Canaan as either the goddess [[Shapash]] or the god [[Shamash]].}} The dry summers of the area were explained as Baʿal's time in the [[underworld]] and his return in autumn was said to cause the storms which revived the land.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}} Thus, the worship of Baʿal in [[Canaan]]—where he eventually supplanted [[El (god)|El]] as the leader of the gods and patron of kingship—was connected to the regions' dependence on rainfall for its agriculture, unlike [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Ancient Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], which focused on irrigation from their major rivers. Anxiety about the availability of water for crops and trees increased the importance of his cult, which focused attention on his role as a rain god.{{sfnp|Pope|2006}} He was also called upon during battle, showing that he was thought to intervene actively in the world of man,{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=134}} unlike the more aloof El. The Lebanese city of [[Baalbeck]] was named after Baal.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Batuman |first=Elif |contribution=The Myth of the Megalith |contribution-url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/baalbek-myth-megalith |title=[[The New Yorker]] |date=18 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baʿal of Ugarit was the epithet of Hadad but as the time passed, the epithet became the god's name while Hadad became the epithet.&lt;ref name="blok"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=zfFeCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA216|title=The Splintered Divine: A Study of Istar, Baal, and Yahweh Divine Names and Divine Multiplicity in the Ancient Near East|page= 216|year= 2015|isbn=9781614512363|author1=Allen|first1=Spencer L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baʿal was usually said to be the son of [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]], but appears as one of the sons of El in [[Ugarit]]ic sources.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}}{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc="[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]"}}{{efn|[[Wolfgang Herrmann|Herrmann]] argues against seeing these separate lineages literally, instead proposing that they describe Baʿal's roles. As a god, he is understood as a child of El, "father of gods", while his fertility aspects connect him to the [[grain god]] Dagan.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}}}} Both Baʿal and El were [[sacred bull|associated with the bull]] in Ugaritic texts, as it symbolized both strength and fertility.{{sfnp|Miller|2000|p=32}} The [[virgin]] goddess [[ʿAnat]] was his sister and sometimes credited with a child through him.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He held special enmity against snakes, both on their own and as representatives of [[Yammu]] (&lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"Sea"), the Canaanite [[List of water deities|sea god and river god]].{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} He fought the [[Tannin (monster)|Tannin]] (''Tunnanu''), the "Twisted Serpent" (''Bṭn ʿqltn''), "[[Litan]] the Fugitive Serpent" (''Ltn Bṭn Brḥ'', the biblical [[Leviathan]]),{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} and the "[[seven-headed serpent|Mighty One with Seven Heads]]" (''Šlyṭ D.šbʿt Rašm'').{{sfnp|Uehlinger|1999|p=512}}{{efn|The account is [[lacuna (MS)|patchy]] and obscure here. Some scholars take some or all of the terms to refer to [[Litan]] and in other passages [[ʿAnat]] takes credit for destroying the monsters on Baʿal's behalf. [[Wolfgang Herrmann|Herrmann]] takes "Šalyaṭu" as a proper name{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} rather than translating it as the "powerful one" or "tyrant".{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc=[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA810 "šlyṭ"]}}}} Baʿal's conflict with Yammu is now generally regarded as the prototype of the vision recorded in the [[Daniel 7|7th chapter]] of the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Book of Daniel]].{{sfnp|Collins|1984|p=77}} As vanquisher of the sea, Baʿal was regarded by the Canaanites and Phoenicians as the [[patron deity|patron]] of [[sailors]] and sea-going merchants.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}} As vanquisher of [[Mot (god)|Mot]], the Canaanite [[death god]], he was known as Baʿal Rāpiʾuma (''Bʿl Rpu'') and regarded as the leader of the [[Rephaim]] (''Rpum''), the ancestral spirits, particularly those of ruling dynasties.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}}

From Canaan, worship of Baʿal spread to Egypt by the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] and throughout the [[Mediterranean basin|Mediterranean]] following the waves of [[Phoenician colonization]] in the early 1st millennium&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=133}} He was described with diverse epithets and, before Ugarit was rediscovered, it was supposed that these referred to distinct local gods. However, as explained by [[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|Day]], the texts at Ugarit revealed that they were considered "local manifestations of this particular deity, analogous to the local manifestations of the [[Virgin Mary]] in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]."{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=68}} In those inscriptions, he is frequently described as "Victorious Baʿal" (''Aliyn'' or ''ẢlỈyn Baʿal''),{{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc="[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]"}}{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} "Mightiest one" (''Aliy'' or ''ʿAly''){{sfnp|''DULAT''|2015|loc="[https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=bh6oBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA203 bʕl (II)]"}}{{efn|This name appears twice in the [[Legend of Keret]] discovered at [[Ugarit]].

===Baʿal Hammon===
{{main|Baal Hammon|l1=Baʿal Hammon}}
[[Baal Hammon|Baʿal Hammon]] was worshipped in the [[Ancient Tyre|Tyrian]] [[Phoenician colonization|colony]] of [[Carthage]] as their [[King of the Gods|supreme god]]. It is believed that this position developed in the 5th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}} following the severing of its ties to [[Ancient Tyre|Tyre]] following the 480&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}} [[Battle of Himera (480 BC)|Battle of Himera]].{{sfnp|Moscati|2001|p=132}} Like Hadad, Baʿal Hammon was a [[fertility god]].{{sfnp|Lancel|1995|p=197}} Inscriptions about [[Carthaginian religion|Punic deities]] tend to be rather uninformative, though, and he has been variously identified as a [[moon god]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and as [[Dagan (god)|Dagan]], the [[grain god]].{{sfnp|Lipiński|1992}} Rather than the bull, Baʿal Hammon was associated with the [[Sheep|ram]] and depicted with his horns. The archaeological record seems to bear out accusations in Roman sources that the Carthaginians [[Carthaginian human sacrifice|burned their children as human sacrifices]] to him. He was worshipped as Baʿal Karnaim ("Lord of the Two Horns"), particularly at an open-air sanctuary at Jebel Bu Kornein ("Two-Horn Hill") across the bay from Carthage. His consort was the goddess [[Tanit]].{{sfnp|Lancel|1995|p=195}}

The epithet Hammon is obscure. Most often, it is connected with the NW Semitic ''ḥammān'' ("[[brazier]]") and associated with a role as a [[sun god]].{{sfnp|Walbank|1979|p=47}} [[Ernest Renan|Renan]] and [[John Clark Love Gibson|Gibson]] linked it to Hammon (modern Umm el-‘Amed between [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon]] and [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] in [[Israel]]){{sfnp|Gibson|1982|p=39 &amp; 118}} and [[Frank Moore Cross|Cross]] and [[Edward Lipiński (orientalist)|Lipiński]] to Haman or Khamōn, the classical [[Mount Amanus]] and modern Nur Mountains, which separate northern [[Syria]] from southeastern [[Cilicia]].{{sfnp|Cross|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bJqwWRDOMgEC&amp;pg=PA26 26–28]}}{{sfnp|Lipiński|1994|p=207}}

==Judaism==
[[File:Elijah slays the prophets of Baal.jpg|right|150px|thumb|Elijah slaying the prophets of Baal]]
Baʿal (בַּעַל) appears about 90 times in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] in reference to various gods.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=132}} The priests of the Canaanite Baʿal are mentioned numerous times, most prominently in the [[First Book of Kings]]. Many scholars believe that this describes [[Jezebel]]'s attempt to introduce the worship of the Baʿal of [[Ancient Tyre|Tyre]], [[Melqart]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities (Josephus)|Antiquities]]'', 8.13.1.&lt;/ref&gt; to the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israelite]] capital [[Samaria]] in the 9th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 "Baal"]}} Against this, [[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|Day]] argues that Jezebel's Baʿal was more probably [[Baʿal Shamem]], the Lord of the Heavens, a title most often applied to Hadad, who is also often titled just Ba‘al.{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=75}}

1 Kings 18 records an account of a contest between the [[prophet (Bible)|prophet]] [[Elijah]] and Jezebel's priests. Both sides offered a [[sacrifice]] to their respective gods: Ba'al failed to light his followers' sacrifice while [[Yahweh]]'s heavenly fire burnt Elijah's altar to ashes, even after it had been soaked with water. The observers then followed Elijah's instructions to slay the priests of Baʿal,&lt;ref name=elijah&gt;{{bibleref|1 Kings|18|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which it began to rain, showing Yahweh's mastery over the weather.

Other references to the priests of Baʿal describe their burning of [[incense]] in [[prayer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2 Kings|23:5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and their offering of [[sacrifice]] while adorned in special [[vestment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2 Kings|10:22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahweh===
{{main|Yahweh|Names of God in Judaism}}
The title ''baʿal'' was a synonym in some contexts of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''[[adon]]'' ("Lord") and ''[[adonai]]'' ("My Lord") still used as aliases of the Lord of Israel [[Yahweh]]. According to some scholars, the [[Hebrew people|early Hebrews]] did use the names Baʿal ("Lord") and Baʿali ("My Lord") in reference to the Lord of Israel, just as Baʿal farther north designated the Lord of [[Ugarit]] or Lebanon.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 "Baal"]}}{{sfnp|Smith|1878|pp=175–176}} This occurred both directly and as the divine element of some Hebrew [[theophoric name]]s. However, according to others it is not certain that the name Baal was definitely applied to Yahweh in early Israelite history. The component Baal in proper names is mostly applied to worshippers of Baal, or descendants of the worshippers of Baal.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=136}} Names including the element Baʿal presumably in reference to Yahweh{{sfnp|Ayles|1904|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nwQ9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA103 103]}}{{sfnp|Smith|1878|pp=175–176}} include the [[judge (Judaism)|judge]] [[Gideon]] (also known as Jerubaʿal, {{abbr|lit.|literally}}&amp;nbsp;"The Lord Strives"), [[Saul the King|Saul]]'s son [[Ish-bosheth|Eshbaʿal]] ("The Lord is Great"), and [[David]]'s son Beeliada ("The Lord Knows"). The name [[Bealiah]] ("The Lord is [[Jah]]"; "Yahweh is Baʿal"){{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc="Baal (Deity)"}} combined the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1 Chron.|12:5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Easton|1893|loc="[https://archive.org/stream/illustratedbible00east#page/86/mode/2up Beali′ah]"}} However John Day states that as far as the names Eshba’al, Meriba’al, and Beeliada (that is Baaliada), are concerned it is not certain whether they simply allude to the Cannanite god Ba’al, or are intended to equate Yahweh with Ba’al, or have no connection to Ba’al.{{sfnp|Day|2000|p=72}}

It was the program of [[Jezebel]], in the 9th century&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bce}}, to introduce into Israel's capital city of Samaria her Phoenician worship of Baal as opposed to the worship of [[Yahweh]] that made the name anathema to the Israelites.{{sfnp|''BEWR''|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dbibAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA102 "Baal"]}}
{{quote|At first the name Baal&lt;!--sic--&gt; was used by the [[Jews]] for their God without discrimination, but as the struggle between the two religions developed, the name Baal was given up by the Israelites as a thing of shame, and even names like Jerubbaal&lt;!--sic--&gt; were changed to Jerubbosheth: Hebrew ''bosheth'' means "shame".{{sfnp|''ZPBD''|1963}}}} Eshbaʿal became [[Ish-bosheth]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and Meribaʿal became [[Mephibosheth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|1 Chron.|9:40|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but other possibilities also occurred. Beeliada is mentioned renamed as Eliada{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and Gideon's name Jerubaʿal was mentioned intact but glossed as a mockery of the Canaanite god, implying that he strove in vain.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Judges|6:32|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct use of Baʿali continued at least as late as the time of the [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Hosea]], who reproached the Israelites for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Hosea|2:16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brad E. Kelle has suggested that references to cultic sexual practices in the worship of Baal, in Hosea 2, are evidence of an historical situation in which Israelites were either giving up Yahweh worship for Baal, or blending the two.  Hosea's references to sexual acts being metaphors for Israelite "apostasy".{{sfnp|Kelle|2005|p=137}}

===Baʿal Berith===
{{main|Baʿal Berith}}
[[Baʿal Berith]] ("Lord of the [[Biblical covenant|Covenant]]") was a god worshipped by the [[Israelites]] when they "went astray" after the death of [[Gideon]] according to the [[Hebrew Scriptures]].&lt;ref name=jdg8&gt;{{bibleref|Jgs.|8:33–34|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The same source relates that Gideon's son [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] went to his mother's kin at [[Shechem]] and received 70 [[shekel]]s of [[silver]] "from the House of Baʿal Berith" to assist in killing his 70 brothers from Gideon's other wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jgs.|9:1–5|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier passage had made Shechem the scene of [[Joshua]]'s covenant between all the [[tribes of Israel]] and "[[El (god)|El]] [[Yahweh]], our [[El (god)|god]] of [[Israelites|Israel]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Josh.|24:1–25|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a later one describes it as the location of the "House of El Berith".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jgs.|9:46|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus unclear whether the false worship of the "Baʿalim" being decried&lt;ref name=jdg8/&gt; is the worship of a new idol or the continued worship of Yahweh, but by means of rites and [[henotheism|teachings]] taking him to be a mere local god within a larger pantheon. The Hebrew Scriptures record the worship of Baʿal threatening [[Israelites|Israel]] from the time of the [[Judge (Judaism)|Judges]] until the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|monarchy]].{{sfnp|Smith|2002|loc=Ch.&amp;nbsp;2}} The [[Deuteronomist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Deut.|4:1–40|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the present form of [[Book of Jeremiah#Composition|Jeremiah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Jer.|11:12–13|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; seem to phrase the struggle as [[monolatry]] or [[monotheism]] against [[polytheism]]. However, Yahweh is firmly identified in the Hebrew Scriptures with [[Elyon|El Elyon]], whose [[Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] figure appears hostile to the cult of Baʿal even in the polytheistic accounts of Ugarit{{which|date=August 2015}} and the Phoenician cities.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sanchuniathon]]''.{{where?|date=August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baʿal Zebub]] ({{lang-he|{{linktext|בעל זבוב}}}}, &lt;small&gt;{{abbr|lit.|literally}}&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;"[[Fly]] Lord"){{sfnp|Arndt &amp; al.|2000|p=173}}{{sfnp|Balz &amp; al.|2004|p=211}}{{efn|"The etymology of Beelzebul has proceeded in several directions. The variant reading Beelzebub (Syriac translators and Jerome) reflects a long-standing tradition of equating Beelzebul with the Philistine deity of the city of Ekron mentioned in 2 Kgs 1:2, 3, 6, 16. Baalzebub (Heb ba˓al zĕbûb) seems to mean “lord of flies” (HALAT, 250, but cf. LXXB baal muian theon akkarōn, “Baal-Fly, god of Akkaron”; Ant 9:2, 1 theon muian)."{{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc="Beelzebul"}}}} occurs in the first chapter of the [[Second Book of Kings]] as the name of the [[Philistines|Philistine]] god of [[Ekron]]. In it, [[Ahaziah of Israel|Ahaziah]], [[kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|king of Israel]], is said to have consulted the priests of Baʿal Zebub as to whether he would survive the injuries from his recent fall. The [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Elijah]], incensed at this impiety, then foretold that he would die quickly, raining heavenly fire on the soldiers sent to punish him for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|2 Kings|1:1–18|HE}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jewish]] scholars have interpreted the title of "Lord of the Flies" as the Hebrew way of calling Baʿal a [[feces|pile of dung]] and his followers [[vermin]],{{sfnp|Kohler|1902}}{{sfnp|Lurker|1987|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vtj0wSsw1JcC&amp;pg=PA31 31]}} although others argue for a link to power over causing and curing [[infection|pestilence]] and thus suitable for Ahaziah's question.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999b}} The [[Septuagint]] renders the name as ''Baälzeboúb'' ({{lang|grc|βααλζεβούβ}}) and as "Baʿal of Flies" ({{lang|grc|βααλ μυιαν}}, ''Baäl muian''). [[Symmachus the Ebionite|Symmachus]] the [[Ebionites|Ebionite]] rendered it as ''Beëlzeboúl'' ({{lang|grc|Βεελζεβούλ}}), possibly reflecting its original sense.{{sfnp|Souvay|1907}}{{efn|Arndt &amp; al. reverse this, saying Symmachus transcribed ''Baälzeboúb'' for a more common ''Beëlzeboúl''.{{sfnp|Arndt &amp; al.|2000|p=173}}}} This has been proposed to have been ''B‘l Zbl'', [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] for "Lord of the Home" or "Lord of the Heavens".{{sfnp|Wex|2005}}{{efn|"It is more probable that b‘l zbl, which can mean “lord of the (heavenly) dwelling” in Ugaritic, was changed to b‘l zbb to make the divine name an opprobrius epithet. The reading Beelzebul in Mt. 10:25 would then reflect the right form of the name, a wordplay on “master of the house” (Gk oikodespótēs)."{{sfnp|McIntosh|1989}}}}{{efn|"An alternative suggested by many is to connect zĕbûl with a noun meaning '(exalted) abode.'"{{sfnp|''AYBD''|1992|loc="Beelzebul"}}}}{{efn|"In contemporary Semitic speech it may have been understood as ‘the master of the house’; if so, this phrase could be used in a double sense in Mt. 10:25b."{{sfnp|Bruce|1996}}}}

==Classical sources==
Outside of Jewish and Christian contexts, the various forms of Baʿal were indifferently rendered in classical sources as [[Belus (disambiguation)|Belus]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Βῆλος}}, ''Bē̂los''). An example is [[Josephus]], who states that [[Jezebel]] "built a temple to the [[patron deity|god]] of the [[Tyrians]], which they call Belus";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; this describes the Baʿal of Tyre, [[Melqart]]. In the ''[[interpretatio graeca]]'', Baʿal was usually associated with [[Jupiter Belus]] but sometimes connected with [[Hercules]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} [[Wolfgang Herrmann|Herrmann]] identifies the [[Demarus]] or Demarous mentioned by [[Philo Byblius]] as Baʿal.{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999a|p=135}}

[[Baʿal Hammon]], however, was identified with the [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] [[Cronus|Cronos]] and the [[Ancient Roman religion|Roman]] [[Saturn (god)|Saturn]] (as the "[[Africa (Rome)|African]] Saturn"). He was probably never equated with Melqart, although this assertion appears in older scholarship.

==Christianity==
[[Beelzebub]] or Beelzebul was identified by the [[Evangelism|writers]] of the [[New Testament]] as [[Satan]], "[[prince]]" (i.e., [[Prince#Prince as generic for ruler|king]]) of the [[demon]]s.{{efn|"In NT Gk. beelzeboul, beezeboul (Beelzebub in TR and AV) is the prince of the demons (Mt. 12:24, 27; Mk. 3:22; Lk. 11:15, 18f.), identified with Satan (Mt. 12:26; Mk. 3:23, 26; Lk. 11:18)."{{sfnp|Bruce|1996}}}}{{efn|"Besides, Matt 12:24; Mark 3:22; Luke 11:15 use the apposition ἄρχων τῶν δαιμονίων ‘head of the →Demons’."{{sfnp|Herrmann|1999b}}}}

[[John Milton]]'s 1667 [[epic poem|epic]] ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' describes the [[fallen angel]]s collecting around Satan, stating that, though their heavenly names had been "blotted out and ras'd", they would acquire new ones "wandring ore the Earth" as false gods. The "Baalim" and "Ashtaroth" are given as the collective names of the male and female demons (respectively) who came from between the "bordring flood of old [[Euphrates]]" and "the [[Brook of Egypt|Brook]] that parts [[Egypt (region)|Egypt]] from [[Syria (region)|Syrian ground]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Milton|Milton]], ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', Bk.&amp;nbsp;1, ll.&amp;nbsp;419–423.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, "Baal" and derived epithets like "Baalist" were used as slurs during the [[English Reformation]] for the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[saint (Christianity)|saints]] and their devotees.

==Islam==
The [[Quran]] mentions the contest between [[Jezebel]]'s priests of Baʿal and the [[prophet (Judaism)|prophet]] [[Elijah]] (Elias)&lt;ref name=elijah/&gt;):
{{quote|And [[Elias]] was most surely of the [[prophet (Islam)|messengers]]. He asked his people: 'Do you not fear &amp;#91;[[Allah|God]]&amp;#93;? Will ye call upon Baal and forsake the best of creators? God is your Lord and the Lord of your fathers, the ancients' But they rejected him, and they will certainly be called up [for [[Hell (Islam)|punishment]]&amp;#93;, except the sincere and devoted [[Muslims|servants of God]] [among them], and we left [this blessing] for him among generations [to come] in later times, peace be upon [[Elias]].&lt;ref&gt;Quran 37:123-130.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The sixth of the tablets was the first to mention [[Latin America]]n regions and was written on April 8, 1916, but was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919—after the end of the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The first actions on the part of Bahá'í community towards Latin America were that of a few individuals who made trips to [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] near or before this unveiling in 1919, including Mr. and Mrs. Frankland, and [[Hands of the Cause#Appointed posthumously by Shoghi Effendi|Roy C. Wilhelm]], and [[Martha Root]]. The sixth tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref name="sohrab"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His Holiness [[Christ]] says: Travel ye to the East and to the West of the world and summon the people to the [[Kingdom of God]].…(travel to) the Islands of the West Indies, such as [[Cuba]], [[Haiti]], [[Puerto Rico]], [[Bahá'í Faith in Jamaica|Jamaica]], the Islands of the [[Lesser Antilles]] (which includes Barbados), [[Bahama Islands]], even the small [[Watling Island]], have great importance…&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html.iso8859-1?#gr10 |pages = 31–36 |origyear = 1916-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1927 [[Leonora Armstrong]] was the first Bahá'í to visit and give lectures about the Bahá'í Faith in many Latin American countries including Barbados as part of her plan to compliment and complete [[Martha Root]]'s unfulfilled intention of visiting all the Latin American countries for the purpose of presenting the religion to an audience.&lt;ref name="memorium"/&gt;

===Seven Year Plan and succeeding decades===
Shoghi Effendi wrote a [[Telegraphy|cable]] on May 1, 1936 to the [[Bahá'í administration#National|Bahá'í Annual Convention]] of the United States and Canada, and asked for the systematic implementation of `Abdu'l-Bahá's vision to begin.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; In his cable he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Appeal to assembled delegates ponder historic appeal voiced by `Abdu'l-Bahá in ''Tablets of the Divine Plan''. Urge earnest deliberation with incoming National Assembly to insure its complete fulfillment. First century of Bahá'í Era drawing to a close. Humanity entering outer fringes most perilous stage its existence. Opportunities of present hour unimaginably precious. Would to God every State within American Republic and every Republic in American continent might ere termination of this glorious century embrace the light of the Faith of Bahá'u'lláh and establish structural basis of His World Order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Shoghi |last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |year = 1947|title = Messages to America  |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Committee |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |oclc =  5806374 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/MA/ma-16.html.iso8859-1?query=Appeal | page = 6 |isbn = 0-87743-145-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the May 1 cable, another cable from Shoghi Effendi came on May 19 calling for permanent [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to be established in all the countries of Latin America.&lt;ref name="alamb"/&gt; The Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] of the United States and Canada appointed the Inter-America Committee to take charge of the preparations. During the 1937 Bahá'í North American Convention, Shoghi Effendi cabled advising the convention to prolong their deliberations to permit the delegates and the National Assembly to consult on a plan that would enable Bahá'ís to go to Latin America as well as to include the completion of the outer structure of the [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in Wilmette, Illinois.  In 1937 the ''First Seven Year Plan''  (1937–44), which was an international plan designed by Shoghi Effendi, gave the American Bahá'ís the goal of establishing the Bahá'í Faith in every country in Latin America. With the spread of American Bahá'ís in Latin American, Bahá'í communities and [[Local Spiritual Assemblies]] began to form in 1938 across the rest of Latin America.

The first Baha'i enrolled in the Bahamas, Charles Winfield Small, was also the next to visit Barbados when he did so in 1958.&lt;ref name="BN323"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Native son opens Barbados to Faith |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=January 1958 |issue = 323 | page = 8| url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=04&amp;page=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the fall of 1964 Mr. D.

==Inter/National development==
As far back as 1951 the Bahá'ís had organized a regional National Assembly for the combination of Mexico, Central America and the Antilles islands.&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb | first = Artemus | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises |date=November 1995 | location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url = http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1966 the region was reorganized among the Bahá'ís of [[Leeward Islands|Leeward]], [[Windward Islands|Windward]] and [[Virgin Islands]] with its seat in [[Charlotte Amalie, United States Virgin Islands|Charlotte Amalie]]&lt;ref name="rid66"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Universal House of Justice  | first =   | authorlink = Universal House of Justice  | title =   Ridván 1966  | work = Ridván Messages | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online  | year = 1966  | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_ridvan_1966  | accessdate = 2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; During October 1966 a trip to ten islands was planned by Lorraine Landau, a pioneer in Barbados.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = A Major Event |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1966 |issue = 427 | page =10 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=06&amp;page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the more notable visitors was [[Hand of the Cause]] [[Ruhiyyih Khanum]] when she toured Caribbean Islands for five weeks in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | title = The Great Safari of Hand of the Cause Ruhiyyih Khanum; Barbados |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1971 | issue = 483 |page=17 | url =http://bahai-news.info/viewer.erb?vol=07&amp;page=825}}&lt;/ref&gt; The
five days of Ruhiyyih Khanum's stay there was packed with activities. She met with the Governor General Sir Winston Scott who also happened to be a medical man and discussed the Faith and allied topics for over half an hour in a most cordial interview. The press and radio coverage was excellent. Prominent women listened to an informal talk given at a reception in her honor. A one-day deepening and teaching school was held at which all the Baha'is as well as their interested friends were present and Ruhiyyih Khanum also addressed a public meeting and was interviewed on a weekly program on the radio program.

From 1972 the regional assembly was reorganized for [[Barbados]], [[St. Lucia]], Barbados, [[Saint Vincent (island)|St. Vincent]], [[Grenada]] and other Windward Islands.&lt;ref name="sum"&gt;{{cite web  | last = Hassall  | first = Graham  | title = Notes on Research on National Spiritual Assemblies  | work = Asia Pacific Bahá'í Studies  | publisher =  Bahá'í Library Online  | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation  | accessdate = 2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hand of the Cause]] [[`Alí-Muhammad Varqá]] attended the inaugural election of the Barbados Bahá'í National Spiritual Assembly in 1981.&lt;ref name="inaugural"/&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.

===Demographics===
In 2005 the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying on [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 1.2% of Barbadians - some 3,500 -  were Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="WCE"/&gt; However Bahá'ís report about 400 members of the religion in the community.&lt;ref name="Baha'is"/&gt; The census reported 178 Bahá'ís.&lt;ref name="census"/&gt;

{{Jainism}}
'''Balatkara Gana''' is an ancient [[Jain]] [[monastic order]]. It is a section of the [[Mula Sangh]]. It is often termed ''Balatkara Gana Sarasvati Gachchha''.&lt;ref&gt;Jain Shilalekh Samgrah, Part 4, Vidyadhar Johrapurkar, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1961&lt;/ref&gt; Until the beginning of the 20th century it was present in a number of places in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Vidaydhar Johrapurkar, Bhattaraka Sampradaya, Solapur, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; However all its seats in North India became vacant in early 20th century. It survives only at [[Humbaj]] in [[Karnataka]], which is its ancient seat.

The [[Bhattaraka]] seat at Humcha was founded in the 8th century AD, during the reign of Jinadatta Rai, founder of the ruling dynasty of Santar. In 1048 AD, the Mahamandaleshwara Chandarayarus made a donation to a Bhattaraka of Balagara-gana at Balligame near Banavasi in present-day [[Karnataka]]. Thus, the Bhattaraka seat at [[Humbaj|Humcha]] (or Humbaj) may be one of the oldest of its kind. The current Bhattaraka Srimad [[Devendrakeerthi]] Bhattaraka Maharaj has supervised 31 pratishthas outside India.

Balatkara Gana  arrived in North India in the 13th century as attested by inscriptions at Un (Vikram 1218), Ahar (Vikram 1228) and Hoshangabad (Vikram 1271.&lt;ref&gt;Bharatiya Digambar Jain Abhilekh, Madhya Pradesh: 13th Shati Tak, Dr. Kasturchand Jain Suman, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

There exists a chronology ([[Pattavali]]) of the northern Indian tradition the early part of which was composed during the time of Bhataraka Prabhachandra II. Early part of the chronology is supported by a 13th-century inscription associated with the building of the [[Kirti Stambh]] of [[Chittore]].&lt;ref&gt; Jain Shilalekh Samgrah, Part 5, Vidyadhar Johrapurkar, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;
The disciples of Bhattaraka [[Prabhachandra]] founded several branches and sub-branches in several regions of India.

==North India Branches==
[[Prabhachandra]] (1318–1368) is regarded to be the first Bhattaraka of [[Delhi]] (see [[Jainism in Delhi]]) who reigned during 1318-1388. His pupil Padmanandi (1368–1418) had three disciples.
*[[Sakalakirti]] (1420–1475), first Bhattakra of [[Idar]] lineage.
* Devendrakirti, who had two disciples:
**Vidyanandi, who founded the Rander-[[Surat]] lineage.
**Tribhuvanakirti who founded the [[Chanderi]] lineage.
*Shubhachandra (1418–1450), whose disciple [[Jivaraj Papriwal|Jinachandra]] (1450–1514), both Bhattarakas of Delhi, had three pupils:
** Ratnakirti, founder of [[Nagaur]] lineage of 26 Bhattarakas into 20th century.
**Prabhachandra II, who had two pupils:
***Dharmachandra, founder of [[Chittore]]/[[Amer, India|Amer]]/[[Jaipur]] lineage
***Sumatikirti, founder of [[Gwalior]] lineage. A branch of this later managed [[Sonagir]] until 1974.

The dates for the Bhattarakas of Delhi were computed by Dr. Jyotiprasad Jain.&lt;ref&gt;Chronology of the Bhattarakas of Delhi, Dr. Jyotiprasad Jain, Anekanta Oct. 1964, pp. 159-164&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pattavalis (pontifical genealogies)==

There exist several pattavalis of Mula Sangh-Balatkara Gana-Saraswati Gachchha.

* By Dr. Hoerncle, published in ''[[The Indian Antiquary]]'', Oct 1891, p341-361; March 1892, pp.57-85 .&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Hoerncle, Sarasvati gachha pattavali, Indian Antiquary, Vol. XX, Oct 1891, March 1892.&lt;/ref&gt; These include Pattavalis
A (1840 CE Nagaur includes Jnatis), B(1840 Chittor includes Jnatis ), C (1450CE), D(1822-1826 CE), E (1880CE, includes Jnatis).
* Amer-Jaipur Pattavali, given by Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri &lt;ref&gt;Siddhantacharya Phulachandra Shastri, Parwar Jain Samaj ka Itihas, 1990, Jabalpur&lt;/ref&gt; (referred to as Ujjain Pattavali).
* Gwalior-Bateshwar Pattavali, given by Pt. Jhammanlal Jain Tarkatirtha.&lt;ref&gt;Pt. Jhammanlal Jain Tarkatirtha, Shri Lamechu Samaj ka Itihas, Calcutta, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattavalis give the following segments&lt;ref&gt;Kailash Chandra Jain, Malwa through the ages, 1972,
Motilal Banarsidass&lt;/ref&gt;

* Bhaddalpur, Dakshin Desh (South country) or Malwa, 26 Acharyas
* [[Ujjain]], 18 Acharyas
* Baran (Near Kota), 12 Acharyas
* [[Gwalior]] (or Chittor and Baghera), 14 Acharyas
* [[Ajmer]] (From Vishalakirti to [[Prabhachandra]], the last Acharya)
* [[Delhi]] (Bhattarakas Prabhachnadra, Padmanandi, Shubhachandra and [[Jinachandra]]

Because of occasional shifting, some of the monks may have lived in different places at different times, causing some disagreements in the pattavalis.

Three inscriptions describing the construction of [[Kirti Stambha]] of [[Chittor]] have been found that mention Vishalakirti-Shubhakirti-Dharmachandra thus conforming the names going back to 13th century.

The '''Bamar''' ({{MYname|MY=ဗမာလူမျိုး|MLCTS=ba. ma lu myui:}}; {{IPA-my|bəmà lùmjó|IPA}}; also historically the '''Burmese''' and '''Burmans''') are the dominant [[ethnic group]] in [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bamar people live primarily in the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy River basin]] and speak the [[Burmese language]], which is the official language of Myanmar.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Bamar customs and identity are closely intertwined with the broader Burmese culture. The Bamar people are often imprecisely called "Burmese", though this term in contemporary usage can refer to any citizen of Myanmar, regardless of ethnicity.Citation needed.

==Origins==
The Bamar speak Burmese, a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]]. The Burmese-speaking people first migrated from present-day [[Yunnan]], China to the Irrawaddy valley in the 7th century. Over the following centuries, the Burmese speakers absorbed other ethnic groups such as the [[Pyu people|Pyu]] and the [[Mon people|Mon]].&lt;ref name=ms-8&gt;Summerer et al 2014: 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Myint-U|2006|pp=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A limited 2014 DNA analysis shows that Burmese people were "typical [[Southeast Asia]]n" but "also with [[Northeast Asia]]n and [[India]]n influences"; and that the gene pool of the Bamar was far more diverse than other ethnic groups such as the [[Karen people|Karen]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;Per (Summerer et al 2014: 1–2, 7–8), a 2014 analysis of 327 citizens of Myanmar, hailing from every administrative region of Myanmar, except for Mandalay Region, then living in northern Thailand; of the 327, the Bamar and the Karen each made up a statistically significant number to be studied. (Summerer et al 2014: 5–6): Per Figure 3, the Myanmar sample fits "very well within the Southeast Asian cluster"; Per Figure 4, the Bamar sample is closer to the Laotian sample and far away from that of the Karen.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ninth century Chinese sources indicate that [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] speaking tribes were present near today's [[Irrawaddy River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brief History of Achang People|last=|first=|publisher=民族出版社|year=2008|isbn=9787105087105|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Book of Man|last=|first=|publisher=中国书店出版社|year=2007|isbn=9787805684765|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tribes were considered ancestors of Bamar people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=民族学报, Volume 2|last=|first=|publisher=Yunnan Nationalities University|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=37, 38, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
[[Burmese language|Burmese]], is spoken by the Bamar but is also widely spoken by ethnic minorities. Its core vocabulary consists of Sino-Tibetan words, but many terms associated with Buddhism, arts, sciences, and government have derived from the [[Indo-European languages]] of [[Pali]] and English. The [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], although culturally distinct from the Bamar, are ethnically related to them and speak a dialect of Burmese that includes retention of the {{IPA|/r/}} sound, which has coalesced into the {{IPA|/j/}} sound in standard Burmese (although it is still present in orthography). Additional dialects come from coastal areas of [[Tanintharyi Region]] (including Myeik (Beik) and [[Dawei]] (Tavoyan)) as well as inland and isolated areas, like Yaw. Other dialects are Taungyoe, Danu, and [[Intha people|Intha]] in [[Shan State]].{{sfn|Gordon|2005}} English was introduced in the 1800s when the Bamar first came into contact with the British as a trading nation and continued to flourish under subsequent colonial rule.

The Bamar are most numerous in Myanmar, constituting the majority ethnic group. Many have settled in Europe, particularly in Great Britain. The Burmese diaspora, which is a recent phenomenon in historical terms and began at the start of World War II, has been mainly brought about by a protracted period of military rule and reflects the ethnic diversity of Myanmar.

The [[Anglo-Burmese people|Anglo-Burmese]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} following Burmese independence in 1948 began moving to the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and North America, to be followed by the Bamar themselves. It is by no means confined to the West; Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Australia, Korea, and Japan are also popular destinations. Burmese settled in Australia, New Zealand, and the UK tend to be overwhelmingly of Anglo-Burmese origins{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

==Culture and society==
[[File:A BURMESE LADY.jpg|thumb|A Bamar woman in the 1920s]]
Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of the religion [[Theravada Buddhism]]. In a traditional village, the monastery is the centre of cultural life. Monks are venerated and supported by the lay people. [[Rites of passage]] are also of cultural importance to the Bamar. These include ''[[shinbyu]]'' ({{my|ရှင်ပြု}}), a novitiate ceremony for Buddhist boys, and ''[[nar tha]]'' ({{my|နားထွင်း}}), an ear-piercing ceremony for girls. Burmese culture is most evident in villages where local festivals are held throughout the year, the most important being the pagoda festival. Many villages have a guardian nat, and superstition and taboos are commonplace.

===Traditional dress=== 
The Bamar traditionally wore sarongs. Women wear a type of sarong known as ''htamain'' ({{my|ထဘီ}}), while men wear a sarong sewn into a tube, called a ''longyi''(လုံချည်),&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://consult-myanmar.com/2015/03/09/myanmars-traditional-fashion-choices-endure/|title=Myanmar’s Traditional Fashion Choices Endure|website=consult-myanmar.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more formally, a single long piece wrapped around the hips, known in Burmese as a ''paso'' ({{my|ပုဆိုး}}). Formal attire often consists of gold jewelry, silk scarves, and jackets. On formal occasions, men often wear cloth turbans called ''[[gaung baung]]'' ({{my|ခေါင်းပေါင်း}}) and [[Mandarin collar|Mandarin collared jackets]] called ''taikpon'' ({{my|တိုက်ပုံ}}), while women wear blouses.

Both genders wear velvet sandals called ''[[Hnyat-phanat|gadiba phanat]]'' ({{my|ကတ္တီပါဖိနပ်}}‌, also called ''Mandalay phanat''), although leather, rubber and plastic sandals ({{my|ဂျပန်ဖိနပ်}}‌, lit. Japanese shoes) are also worn. In cities and urban areas, Western dress, including T-shirts, jeans and sports shoes or trainers, has become popular, especially among the younger generation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Talismanic tattoos, earrings, and long hair tied in a knot were once common among Bamar men, but have ceased to be fashionable since after World War II; men in shorts and sporting ponytails, as well as both sexes with bleached hair, have made their appearance in [[Yangon]] and [[Mandalay]] more recently, especially in the anything-goes atmosphere of the Burmese New Year holiday known as [[Thingyan]].

Westernization mostly comes via Japan and [[Singapore]]. Bamar people of both sexes and all ages also wear ''[[thanaka]]'', especially on their faces, although the practice is largely confined to women, children and young, unmarried men. Western makeup and cosmetics have long enjoyed a popularity in urban areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, thanaka is not exclusively worn by the Bamar, as many other ethnic groups throughout Burma utilize this cosmetic.

===Cuisine===
[[Burmese cuisine|Bamar cuisine]] contains many regional elements, such as [[stir frying]] techniques and curries which can be hot but lightly spiced otherwise, almost always with [[fish paste]] as well as onions, garlic, ginger, dried chili and turmeric. Rice ({{my|ထမင်း}} ''htamin'') is the staple, although [[noodles]] ({{my|ခေါက်ဆွဲ}} ''hkauk swè''), [[salad]]s ({{my|အသုတ်}} ''a thouk''), and breads ({{my|ပေါင်မုန့်}} ''paung mont'') are also eaten. [[Green tea]] is often the beverage of choice, but tea is also traditionally pickled and eaten as a salad called ''[[lahpet]]''. The best-known dish of Bamar origin is ''[[mohinga]]'', rice noodles in a fish broth. It is available in most parts of the region, also considered as the national dish of [[Myanmar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodrepublic.com/2017/02/22/burmese-food-primer/|title=Burmese Food Primer: Essential Dishes To Eat In Myanmar|date=2017-02-22|work=Food Republic|access-date=2018-07-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes from other ethnic minorities such as the Shah, Chinese, and Indian, are also consumed.

===Music===
Traditional [[music of Myanmar]] consists of an orchestra mainly of percussion and wind instruments but the ''[[saung|saung gauk]]'' ({{my|စောင်းကောက်}}), a boat-shaped harp, is often symbolic of the Bamar. Other traditional instruments include ''[[pattala]]'' (Burmese [[xylophone]]), ''[[walatkhok]]'', ''[[lagwin]]'', and ''[[Pat waing|hsaingwaing]]''. Modern Bamar music is typically westernized, with influences particularly from American [[country music]]. However, rap and hip-hop have also gained popularity. Traditional Bamar dancing is similar to Thai dancing. Puppetry is also a popular form of entertainment and is often performed at ''pwé''s, which is a generic term for shows, celebrations and festivals. In urban areas, movies from both [[Bollywood]] and Hollywood have long been popular, but more recently Korean and Chinese films, especially DVDs, have become increasingly popular.

===Festivals===
Buddhist festivals and holidays are widely celebrated by the Bamar people. ''[[Thingyan]]'', the Water Festival, which marks the beginning of the Burmese New Year in April, is one such example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://idealtravelasia.com/burmese-celebrate-new-year-festival/|title=HOW THE BURMESE CELEBRATE NEW YEAR FESTIVAL?|date=2017-06-16|work=EN - To travel is to live|access-date=2018-07-09|language=vi-VN}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Thadingyut Festival|Thadingyut]]'', which marks the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist lent]], is celebrated with the Festival of Lights in October. ''[[Kathina]]'' or robe offering ceremony for monks is held at the start of Lent in July and again in November.

===Religion===
[[File:Nat-ein.jpg|thumb|A ''[[nat ein]]'' in Downtown Yangon]]
The majority of the Bamar are [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhists]]. People are expected to keep the basic [[Five Precepts]] and practise ''[[dāna]]'' "charity", ''sīla'' "[[Buddhist ethics]]" and ''[[vipassanā]]'' "meditation". Most villages have a monastery and often a [[stupa]] maintained and supported by the villagers. Annual [[pagoda festival]]s usually fall on a full moon, and robe offering ceremonies for [[bhikkhu]]s are held both at the beginning and after the [[Vassa]]. This coincides with the [[monsoon]]s, during which the [[uposatha]] is generally observed once a week.

Children were educated by monks before secular state schools came into being. A [[shinbyu]] ceremony by which young boys become novice monks for a short period is considered the most important duty of Buddhist parents. Christian missionaries had made little impact on the Bamar despite the popularity of missionary schools in cities.

The Bamar practise Buddhism along with ''[[nat (spirit)|nat]]'' worship which predated Buddhism. It involves rituals relating to a pantheon of 37 Nats or spirits designated by King [[Anawrahta]], although many minor nats are also worshipped. In villages, many houses have outdoors altars to honor nats, called ''nat ein'' ({{my|နတ်အိမ်}}‌), in addition to one outside the village known as ''nat sin'' ({{my|နတ်စင်}}‌) often under a bo tree (''[[Ficus religiosa]]''). Indoors in many households, one may find a coconut called ''nat oun'' up the main post for the ''Eindwin Min Mahagiri'' ({{my|အိမ်တွင်းမင်းမဟာဂိရိ}}; lit. "Indoor Lord of the Great Mountain"), considered one of the most important of the Nats.

The term "Bamar" is sometimes used to refer to both the practice of Buddhism as well as the ethnic identity. Bamar Muslims, however, practice Islam and claim ethnic Bamar heritage and culture in all matters other than religion.&lt;ref name="Ayako"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs21/Formation_of_the_Concept_of_Myanmar_Muslims_as_Indigenous-en.pdf | title=The Formation of the Concept of Myanmar Muslims as Indigenous Citizens: Their History and Current Situation | author=Ayako, Saito | journal=The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies | year=2014 | issue=32 | pages=25–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
{{main|Burmese names}}

In the past, the Bamar typically had shorter names, usually limited to one or two syllables. However, the trend of adopting longer names (four or five for females and three for males) has become popular. Bamar names also frequently make use of [[Pali]]-derived loan words. Bamar people typically use the day of birth (traditional 8-day calendar, which includes ''[[Rahu|Yahu]]'', Wednesday afternoon) as the basis for naming, although this practice is not universal.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=4}} Letters from groups within the [[Burmese alphabet]] are designated to certain days, from which the Bamar choose names.{{sfn|Scott|1882|p=4-6}}

They are chosen as follows:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3750">The history of the Bengali Hindu community dates back to the middle ages, when the Arakanese kings brought Brahmins from Bengal as astrologers and Doms as cleaners of the pagoda compounds in Arakan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.kaladanpress.org/index.php/seminar-and-event-mainmenu-38/58-arakan-historical-seminar/195-islam-in-arakan-an-interpretation-from-the-indian-perspective-history-and-the-present.html|title=Islam in Arakan: An interpretation from the Indian perspective: History and the Present|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Swapna|date=22-23 November 2005|pages=20|location=Bangkok|conference=Arakan Historical Conference||access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the annexation of Burmese kingdom by the British, the Bengali Hindus arrived in British Burma in various capacities. A large section came as white collared executives in the administration, while a smaller proportion came as labourers in various projects. By the 1920s, the Bengali Hindus constituted a thriving community in the urban centres like Rangoon, Mandalay, Moulmein, Bassein and Akyab. Starting with the anti-Indian movements in the late 1930s, the Bengali Hindus began to leave British Burma in hundreds. After the independence and especially the 1962 coup, large numbers of Bengali Hindus left for India.

At present, the [[Bengali Hindu]] population is concentrated in the cities of [[Yangon]] and [[Sittwe]] and in the some of the semi-urban and rural areas of [[Rakhine State]]. The estimated population quoted in various source range between 10,000 to 56,000. The [[Bengali Hindus]] are not recognized as full citizens as per the 1982 law, but are entitled to hold the ID Card for National Verification.

== Identity ==
In [[Myanmar]], the citizenship issue of the [[Rohingyas]] has led to identity crisis among the Bengali Hindu population. While the Rohingyas prefer to use the term Rohingya to identify themselves, the Myanmar authorities insist on using the term Bengalis for the Rohingyas. As the Rohingyas are considered as illegal Bangladeshi immigrants, the Bengali Hindus in Rakhine State shun the usage of the term Bengali to identify themselves. They prefer to identify themselves as [[Hinduism in Myanmar|Burmese Hindus]].

In the recent times, the [[Bengali Hindus]] have started wearing small armbands to distinguish themselves from the Rohingya.&lt;ref name="rfp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rfp.org/sites/default/files/pubications/Advancing%20Peacebuilding%20in%20Myanmar%20.pdf|title=Advances Reconciliation and Peacebuilding  in Sittwe, Rakhine State, Myanmar|publisher=Religions for Peace|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bengali Hindu women have started wearing bindis to distinguish themselves from the [[Rohingyas]].&lt;ref name="aj09082012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/08/201288114724103607.html|title='Mass graves' for Myanmar's Rohingya|date=9 August 2012|work=Al Jazeera|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Persecution ==
In 1962, after the coup, an estimated 300,000 Indians were forced to leave Burma. The repatriates included a significant number of Bengali Hindus of East Bengal origin. The Bengali Hindu returnees were settled in four camps in [[Kamarhati]], [[Barasat]], [[Bongaon]] and [[Hasnabad]], in the 24 Parganas district of [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcrg.ac.in/rw%20files/RW37/9.Report3.pdf|title=Collective Memories of Repatriates from  Burma: A Case Study of West Bengal|publisher=Mahanirban Calcutta Research Group|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bugang''''' is a [[Daoist]] [[ritual dance]] or walk, based upon the limping ''[[Yubu]]'' "Steps of Yu" tradition, in which a [[Taoist priest]] paces through a supernatural pattern, such as stars in the [[Big Dipper]] or numbers in the [[Lo Shu Square|Loshu magic square]]. Texts from the (4th century) [[Shangqing School]] "revelations" contain the earliest descriptions of ''bugang'', frequently with the practitioner pacing among constellations, especially the Big Dipper's stars. When religious Daoism began during the [[Six Dynasties]] period (220-589 CE), the expression ''bugang tadou'' 步罡踏斗 "pacing the guideline and treading on (the stars of) the Dipper" became popular.

==Terminology==
''Bugang'' "pacing the stars of the Big Dipper" combines two Chinese words, ''bu'' [[wikt:步|步]] "step; tread; pace (off)" and ''gang'' [[wikt:罡|罡]] "Big Dipper; (esp.) stars in the handle of the Big Dipper", and was first recorded in the (c. 3rd century) ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'' (''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' 1990 5:334).

The variant ''bugang'' 步綱 "pacing the guideline", which uses a different ''gang'' word [[wikt:綱|綱]] "headrope of a fishing net; key link; guiding principle; guideline", was first recorded in the (c. 1029) ''[[Yunji Qiqian]]'' anthology of the ''[[Daozang|Daoist Canon]]'' (''Hanyu Da Cidian'' 5:336).

Several later Daoist scriptures on ''bugang'' write it 布剛 with [[variant Chinese character]]s, writing ''bu'' 步 "walk" as [[wikt:布|布]] "distribute; spread; declare", and ''gang'' 罡 "Dipper" or ''gang'' 綱 "guideline" as ''gang'' [[wikt:剛|剛]] "strength; firmness". Andersen (1989:30) says that frequently the notions of "walking the guideline, spreading out the guideline, and distributing strength are subtly blended."

The phrase ''bugang tadou'' 步罡踏斗 "pacing the guideline and treading on (the stars of) the Dipper" adds the words ''ta'' [[wikt:踏|踏]] "step on; tread; trample" and ''dou'' [[wikt:斗|斗]] "dipper; Big Dipper".

''Beidou'' 北斗 (lit. "Northern Dipper) is the common Chinese name for the [[Big Dipper]]. ''Tiangang'' 天罡 and ''Tiangangxing'' 天罡星 (with ''tian'' [[wikt:天|天]] "sky; h/Heaven" and ''xing'' [[wikt:星|星]] "star; heavenly body") both mean "Big Dipper; (esp.) handle of the Big Dipper" – and are the second of the [[108 Stars of Destiny]] in the ''[[Water Margin]]''.

The Tang dynasty poet [[Lu Guimeng]] (d. 881) coined the expression ''bugangtan'' 步罡壇 "pacing the guideline (around the) altar".

==Practices==
''Bugang'' is practiced in two basic forms: the Shangqing School walk along the seven stars of the [[Big Dipper]] and the Zhengyi School walk through the [[bagua|eight trigrams]] arranged in the ''Luoshu'' 洛書 magic square (Andersen 1989:17-18). In both variants of the practice, each step is accompanied by three actions coordinated with the movements of the feet: the inwardly pronounced line of incantation when the priest reaches the star or trigram in question, the visualization of a journey through heaven, and ''shoujue'' 手訣 "hand practices" in which the thumb of the left hand represents movement in parallel to the body of the priest. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, the basic patterns followed in the practice of ''bugang'' are associated with the concept of the movement through heaven of the high god Taiyi, the Great One, or the Supreme Unity, and the accompanying incantations often make it clear that as the priest performs the walk, he impersonates Taiyi. A powerful theme underlying the practice is that of world-creation and the establishment of order, frequently associated with the construction of the sacred area in the initial part of a ritual. Within the liturgy, however, the characteristic specific functions of ''bugang'' are, first, to serve as elements of the purification of the ritual area, and second, to structure the movement of the high priest (''gaogong'' 高功), as he approaches the point of the transmission of a document to heaven, and the point of his ascent in order to deliver the document to the Most High. (Andersen 2008:239-240) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The Daoist [[Lingbao School]] also performed the ''Yubu'' ritual (Robinet 1997:173-174).

==Shangqing==
[[File:Ursa Minor constellation map.svg|thumb|[[Ursa Minor]] constellation map]]
[[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] "Supreme/Highest Clarity" School texts, supposedly revealed to [[Yang Xi]] from 364 to 370 CE, contain the earliest extant references to ''bugang'' along the stars of the Dipper (Andersen 1989:18). Early Shangqing texts emphasize that the purpose of ''bugang'' is to achieve individual immortality through the ascent to heaven (Andersen 2008:239).
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the Shangqing texts, where this practice has not yet reached the great complexity that it would acquire later, the adept draws the stars of Ursa Major on a silk ribbon, and, after constructing a sacred enclosure by commanding the planets to take their places around him, he "clothes himself" in the stars of the Dipper and then rises into the constellation. First, he walks around the outer circle of "dark stars," invoking the goddesses who live in them. Only then can he proceed to the male gods of the Dipper, making the resident god appear as he steps on each star in turn, following a strict order. Robinet (1997:145) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

For instance, the ''Bu tiangang jing'' 步天綱經 "Scripture on Walking the Celestial Mainstay" (DZ 1316), which explains itself as the full revelation mentioned in an earlier "excerpted and abbreviated" text, describes the origins and practice of ''bugang''.  It states than in 24 BCE, Wang Feng 王鳳, uncle of [[Wang Mang]] who overthrew the Han and founded the brief [[Xin dynasty]], obtained a summary of ''bugang'' methods from "practitioner of the Dao" Liu Jing 劉京, who in turn had studied them with "teacher in transcendence" Lord Zhang of [[Handan]] 邯鄲張君 (Campany 2002:250). Although this ''Bu tiangang jing'' time scheme may prove to correspond to the actual history of ''bugang'', Andersen (1989:18) says this story "also gives ample cause for suspicion." The emphasis on the usurpant emperor Wang Mang may well be a reflection of the ''Hanshu'' (99) story – which does not refer to any walking – that Wang Mang used the Dipper as a cosmic weapon to protect himself against his enemies. "We find ample information in Han dynasty texts on the use of the Dipper as an exorcistic weapon, but I have found no trace of ''bugang'' in any of these accounts."

The ''Bu tiangang jing'' describes ''bugang'' as an ecstatic flight through the stars. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he adept is required first to pace back and forth through the stars three times and then to perform a final walk from the first to the ninth star, in all cases skipping the third star, ''Zhenren'', the Perfected, which is to be avoided, and which is instead saluted by the adept, when he is standing in the ninth star. Generally, each step is accompanied by an incantation which is pronounced by the adept standing in the star and which evokes the image of the deity of the star in question. (Andersen 1898:38) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The deity Taiyi 太一, translated as the Great One, Great Oneness, Great Monad, and Great Unity, has been viewed as the supreme god of heaven since the late [[Warring States period]]. According to [[Chinese mythology]] and astronomical tradition, Taiyi, the Emperor of Heaven, resides in the brightest star in the bowl of the "Little Dipper", the large, reddish Kochab or [[Beta Ursae Minoris]] (β UMi) near the northern [[Pole star]] (Andersen 1989:24).

Traditional Chinese astronomy calls β UMi the ''beijier'' 北極二 "North Pole second [star]", and locates [[Ursa Minor (Chinese astronomy)|Ursa Minor]] within the ''Ziweiyuan'' 紫微垣 [[Purple Forbidden enclosure]]. Beta Ursae Minoris is described variously as the ladle by which Taiyi pours out the primordial breath and as the chariot in which he moves through the heavens. "The underlying cosmographic concept is that of the Dipper as a pointer — and a conductor — stretching out from the pole of heaven to the belt of the celestial equator and, by its annual movement, like the outer leg of a compass, describing a circle which is the circumference of heaven" (Andersen 1989:25).  In Chinese terms, ''gang'' 綱 "guiding rope of a net" is the Dipper and ''ji'' 紀 "leading thread" is the circle, and their original meanings were semantically extended in ''gangji'' 綱紀 "social order and law", the norms of conduct directed by the emperor. ''Gang'' and ''Ji'' connect in the constellation ''Jiao'' 角 "[[Horn (Chinese constellation)|Horn]]", which is one of the 28 ''xiu'' 宿 "[[lunar mansion]]s" at which the Dipper points during the year. The ''Hanshu'' calendrical treatise calls the Dipper ''tian zhi gang'' 天之綱 "Heaven's ''gang''", and associates ''ji'' 紀 (or ''ji'' 記 "record) with the 12-year cycle of Jupiter around the sun, which is related to various calendrical sequences and cycles of time.

Daoist technical vocabulary for ''bugang'' contrasts ''Tiangang'' 天綱 "Guideline of Heaven" with ''Diji'' 地紀 "Sequence of Earth", referring to the seasonal changes on earth, activated by the movements in heaven, and conceived as a spatial flow on the circumference of the earth. "Thus it represents the terrestrial pattern to which the powers emanating from the pole of heaven are transferred by the Dipper performing its annual revolution in the sky" (Andersen 1989:26).

The ''Feixing jiuchen yujing'' 九晨玉經 "Nine Monarchs' Jade Scripture on Flying" and other Shangqing revealed texts describe ''bugang'' as either walking across the stars of the Dipper as it appears in the sky or walking around the five planets. It is categorized under the term ''feibu zhi dao'' 飛步之道 "the way of the flying walk". The ''Bu tiangang jing'' describes the long-term results of these practices.
&lt;blockquote&gt;If you constantly tread on emptiness (i.e., the stars), then after one year you will avoid blame, after two years you will avoid weapons, after three years you will avoid death, and after four years you will become a terrestrial immortal. None of the myriad harmful and evil influences will dare act upon you. From then on your blessings will be countless. You cause the gods to arrive, you command the spiritual forces. You ride a chariot yoked with flying dragons. The heaven of the Supreme Pole (''Taiji'' 太極) presents you with the fungus of immortality. The Jade Emperor (''Yudi'' 玉帝) gives you immortal lads [to escort you]. If you practice it for two times seven years, you will become a Perfected of the heaven of Superior Purity. (DZ 1316, tr. Andersen 1989:38) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This ''Shangqing'' form of ''bugang'' was almost exclusively used for purposes of individual salvation, rather than used within the framework of a larger ritual context, as seen in the Zhengyi tradition.

==Zhengyi==
The [[Zhengyi Dao]] "Way of Orthodox Unity" began during the [[Tang dynasty]] as a transformation of the earlier [[Tianshi Dao]] "Way of the Celestial Masters", and became prominent during the [[Song dynasty]] under [[Emperor Huizong of Song|Emperor Huizong]] and the [[List of Celestial Masters|30th Celestial Master]] Zhang Jixian 張繼先 (1092-1126). The Zhengyi tradition changed the Shangqing practice of ''bugang'' from an individual walk through the stars into a liturgical walk through the ''jiugong'' 九宫 "Nine Palaces" with the 8 trigrams arranged around the ''Luoshu''. Zhengyi forms of ''bugang'' were incorporated into the general liturgy for purposes of exorcism and purification, an essential part of the ''zhu jinfa'' 诸禁法 "many methods of restriction", particularly during the initial and final parts of ceremonies.

The ''Shangqing huangshu guodu yi'' 上清黄書過度儀 "Liturgy of Passage of the Yellow Writ of Highest Clarity" (DZ 1294) is the earliest preserved ''Zhengyi'' text to record ''bugang''-type dancing following the magic-square pattern. Mark Csikszentmihalyi (2008:868) says, "This text may date from the second to fifth centuries CE, and reflects the integration of ritualized visualization, invocation, and sexual techniques." According to Andersen (1989:18), "It presents a wedding ritual, or perhaps one should rather say a rite of sexual union. In any case, sexual union takes place as a part of the ritual, which also includes certain dances performed by the couple." This text uses the word ''nie'' 躡 "walk on tiptoe; walk quietly; tread" in ''nieji'' 躡紀 "treading the sequence" or ''nieshi'' 躡時 "treading the [pattern of] time" – instead of ''bugang'', which later became the standard term – describing a ritual dance in which the couple each puts one foot in opposing [[earthly branches]] and joins their other two feet in the center, then shifting to the next earthly branch, and so on until they have gone through the whole circle. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Nieji'' refers specifically to the practice, performed repeatedly during the ritual and in turns by both participants, of "toeing" with one foot the body of the other while lying side by side. The movement starts from the heart and describes a circle in eleven steps, the man moving his left foot clockwise to an end point on the right side of the woman and the woman moving her right foot counter-clockwise to an end point on the left side of the man. In both cases it is clear from the accompanying incantation that the notion of the movement of the four seasons is involved. The practice, which is described also as a form of massage, clearly intends to establish an inner circulation in accordance with the patterns of the universe. (Andersen 1989:27). &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This text gives a series of sexually implicit incantations for ''[[neidan]]'' "inner circulations" uniting the couple's ''yin'' and ''yang'', in order to reach the ''Shengmen'' 生門 "Gate of Life" (tr. Andersen 1989:27). The man says, "I wish to mount the Guideline of Heaven and enter the Sequence of Earth. The four seasons and the five elements are each of themselves apposite." The woman says, "I wish to lie on earth and receive heaven, uniting ''yin'' and ''yang''. The four seasons and the five elements are each of themselves apposite." They both say, "The five breaths — both the dark and the yellow — adhere of their own [to my body]. They return to my five organs, which glow with light."

The basis of ritual dances in the ''Huangshu'' is referred to as ''Taiyi bu jiugong'' 太一步九宫, "The walk of Taiyi through the Nine Palaces" (8 trigrams plus center in the ''Luoshu'' magic square), which represents Taiyi travelling though the Nine Heavens. The couple creates a ritual area by ''bu'' "distributing" the Nine Palaces, by joining fingers or toes so as to give a total number corresponding to each position, and calling out the name and number of the palace in question. The trigrams and gates of the Nine Palaces are further associated with the "nine" stars of the Big Dipper, which has seven visible stars. The number of nine is reached by the addition of two "assistant" stars: ''Fuxing'' 輔星 ([[Mizar and Alcor|Alcor]], 80 Ursae Majoris) and ''Bixing'' 弼星, an invisible star near the handle of the Dipper. These nine stars have a special Daoist nomenclature of: Tianpeng 天蓬, Tiannei 天内, Tianchong 天衝, Tianfu 天輔, Tianqin 天禽, Tianxin 天心, Tianzhu 天柱, Tianren 天任, and Tianying 天英 (Andersen 1989:34).

The ''Shangqing huangshu guodu yi'' pattern of "walking" on the body is paralleled by the ''Zhengyi'' liturgy of present-day south Taiwan, wherein the priest performs ''bugang'' simultaneously as a walk with his feet on the ground and a walk with his thumb on his left hand. For example, the Zeng family's secret manual says, "With the foot one treads the Dipper, while in the hand one points to the fingers. There must be absolutely no disorderly movement. When the foot reaches the Gate of Heaven, the hand reaches the Gate of Heaven. When the foot reaches the Door of Earth, the hand reaches the Door of Earth. The secret instructions of Taoism embrace heaven and earth" (tr. Andersen 1989:28).

The Song dynasty Zhengyi master Lu Shizhong 路時中, who founded the ''Yutang dafa'' 玉堂大法 tradition in the 1120s, explained the efficacy of ''bugang'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Between heaven and earth man is the most numinous of all things. Therefore, whenever he points in his hand or walks with his feet, he is united with Perfection (''zhen'' 真). The method of ''bugang'' arises from this. To perform ''bugang'' is to fly along the essences of heaven, to tread the numinae of earth, and to set the perfection of man in motion. Through it the Three Powers (''Sancai'' 三才, i.e., the three cosmic planes) unite their virtues, the nine breaths are aligned, and demons and spirits spin. (''Wushang xuanyuan santian yutang dafa'', DZ 220, tr. Andersen 1989:28) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Daoists have conceived Taiyi's movements as occurring either along the stars of the Dipper or through the palaces of the eight trigrams, in both cases leading eventually to a return to the point of departure. One solution to the problem of how Taiyi returns through the Dipper involves the ''Santai'' 三台 "Three Terraces", three pairs of stars in [[Ursa Major (Chinese astronomy)|Ursa Major]] below the Dipper, from [[Iota Ursae Majoris]] to [[61 Ursae Majoris]]. The ''Santai'' are described as "the staircase of heaven" and "the road along which Taiyi descends and ascends". In many variants of ''bugang'', "the priest begins by walking along the stars of the Dipper — starting out from the star closest to the pole — and ends by returning to the Gate of Heaven along the Three Terraces" (Andersen 1989:30).

The two major forms of ''bugang'' are modelled on the two patterns of Taiyi moving through the stars or the trigrams, expressed by the priest's incantations that he is impersonating Taiyi. ''Bugang'' is categorized into two ritual functions, either serving purposes of exorcism (focusing on Taiyi's outward movement and distribution of strength) or purposes of ascent (focusing on his return to the center). ''Bugang'' 布剛 "distribution of strength" occurs in the ''Chunqiu yundou shu'' 春秋運斗樞describing the ''Sanhuang'' 三皇 "Three Sovereigns", "They contained all vastness and walked in the centre; they opened up ''yin'' and ''yang'' and distributed strength" (tr. Andersen 1989:30).

The ''Jiuling gang'' 九靈罡 "Guideline of the Nine Spirits" ''bugang'' practice has been one of the most widespread in Daoist texts since the Song dynasty, and is still practiced by ''Zhengyi'' priests under the name ''Tianhuang dou'' 天皇斗, "Dipper of the Celestial Sovereign [i.e., Taiyi]". The ''Jiuling gang'' is based on the Daoist [[celestial stem]]-based "magic invisibility" system of [[Qi Men Dun Jia|Qimen Dunjia]] "Irregular Gate, Hidden Stem", which the (4th century) ''Baopuzi'' [[Yubu#Baopuzi|"Into Mountains: Over Streams"]] chapter first mentioned in context with ''Yubu''. The ''Dunjia'' 遁甲 "Hidden Stem" calculates the position within the space-time structure of the ''liuding'' 六丁 ("six ''ding''") "spirits that define the place of the ''Qimen'' 奇門 "Irregular Gate", going through which one may obtain invisibility and thus protection from all dangers. Irregular Gate divination is associated with Eight Gates, namely the Gate of Rest, of Life, of Injury, of Closing, of Brilliance, of Death, of Fright, and Gate of Opening. The incantation begins:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential wonder of the Dipper, the twelve chronograms (''chen'' 辰). I mount the numinous light, and the majestic martial forces are deployed. The breaths appear like floating clouds. Their seven movements correspond to heaven above. I know that the transformations have auspicious and inauspicious times. I enter the constellation of the Dipper and cross the Threshold of Heaven (''Tianguan'' 天關, i.e., the seventh star of the Dipper). I obey the law of the six combinations and abide by ''jia'' and ''yi'' [甲乙]. (DZ 220, tr. Andersen 1989:36) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This is followed by the walk through the stars, accompanied by sentences enumerating of the names of the stars, with the walk starting in ''Tianying'' and ending through an exit in ''Tianpeng''. The incantation concludes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The way of the Dipper is accomplished, the hard and soft (i.e., ''yang'' and ''yin'') reach their full capacity. The ten thousand evil influences are exterminated, the hundred devils destroyed. Happiness and blessing are increased and passed on to following generations. I enter the region of obscurity and live forever. (DZ 566, tr. Andersen 1989:36) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:iching-hexagram-63.svg|thumb|''Yijing'' Hexagram 63, ''Jiji'' 既濟 "Already Fording".]]
The Zhengyi (1201) ''Daomen tongjiao ji'' 道門通教集 "Collected Works for All Daoists Penetrating the Teaching" text records ''bugang'' purification of the altar at the end of the rite, following the "three steps and nine traces" from the ''Baopuzi''. It is compared with walking the ''[[Yijing]]'' [[I Ching hexagram 63#Hexagram 63|Hexagram 63]], ''Jiji'' 既濟 "Already Fording", which is composed of the [[Bagua|trigrams]] ''li'' 離 (☲) Fire and ''kan'' 坎 (☵) Water. This hexagram comparison "is based on the equivalence of an isolated step with an unbroken line and two juxtaposed steps with a broken line" (Andersen 1989:43), with a bottom-center first step and top-left ninth step.

[[Du Guangting]]'s (891) ''Taishang huanglu zhaiyi'' 太上黃籙齋儀 "Protocols for Yellow Register Rites of the Most High" (DZ 507) describes using ''bugang'' during presentation of the memorial in the general liturgy. This practice originated with the Song dynasty ''Zhengyi'' tradition of the Tianxin zhengfa 天心正法 "Orthodox Method of the Celestial Heart", founded by [[Huashu#Tan Zixiao|Tan Zixiao]].

The (1116) ''Taishang zhuguo jiumin zongzhen biyao'' 太上助国救民总真秘要 "Secret Essentials of the Perfected Totality, of the Most High, for Assisting the Country and Saving the People" (DZ 1227), compiled by Yuan Miaozong 元妙宗, has a section on ''bugang'' that contains Tang dynasty altar purification techniques, which are still used by ''Zhengyi'' Daoist priests. The ''Huitan gang'' 回壇罡, "Guideline for Returning to the Altar", for example, gives a diagram with an incantation for each star.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Gate of Heaven is opened above. The wheel of the method of flying to heaven moves with the speed of thunder and lightning and advances like wind and clouds. The yellow memorial reaches upwards and penetrates to the Court of Heaven. My body returns to the Gate of Heaven, where it merges with spontaneity and unites in Perfection with the Way. The body (of the high priest) enters the Gate of Heaven below the Golden Portal. He offers three sticks of incense and after this submits the memorial. (tr. Andersen 1989:47-48) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Present day==
In contemporary Daoism, the ''bugang'' "Pacing the Dipper" rite continues to be practiced. Poul Andersen says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The forms of ''bugang'' used in present-day liturgy mostly derive from the ritual compilations of the Song dynasty. They are typically performed by the high priest alone and are described in his "secret manual" (''mijue'' [秘訣]). The practice is highly valued by the present-day priesthood, and it is commonly conceived as a foundational element of Taoist ritual. A similar view is expressed in many historical texts, such as in the ''Taishang zhuguo jiumin zongzhen biyao'' ([太上助國救民總真必要] Secret Essentials of the Totality of Perfected, of the Most High, for Assisting the Country and Saving the People...), by Yuan Miaozong, who says: "The Paces of Yu along the guideline of the Dipper, and the instructions for practices in the palm of the hand, are the great essentials of the Way, the primordial leading thread of (all other) methods." (2008:240) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Criticism of Judaism}}
{{Lead too short|date=September 2016}}
'''Criticism of Judaism''' refers to criticism of [[Jewish]] [[Judaism|religious doctrines]], [[Jewish literature|texts]], [[Jewish laws|laws]] and [[Jewish culture|practices]].  Early criticism originated in inter-faith polemics between [[Christianity]] and Judaism.  Important [[disputations]] in the Middle Ages gave rise to widely publicized criticisms. Modern criticisms also reflect the inter-branch [[Jewish schisms]] between [[Orthodox Judaism]], [[Conservative Judaism]], and [[Reform Judaism]].

==Inter-branch criticisms==

===Criticism of Conservative Judaism from other branches===
{{Main|Criticism of Conservative Judaism}}
Conservative Judaism is criticized by some leaders of [[Orthodox Judaism]] for not properly following [[Halakha]] (Jewish religious law).&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shafran]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20060106063953/http://www.momentmag.com/archive/feb01/feat2.html "The Conservative Lie"], ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also criticized by some leaders of [[Reform Judaism]] for being at odds with the principles of its young adult members on issues such as [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]], [[Patrilineality|patrilineal descent]], and the ordination of homosexuals — all issues that Conservative Judaism opposes and Reform Judaism supports.&lt;ref name="Berkofsky"&gt;Joe Berkofsky, [http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/21714/edition_id/441/format/html/displaystory.html "Death of Conservative Judaism?

===Criticism of traditional Judaism by reform movement===
{{See also|Reform movement in Judaism|Jewish schisms|Jewish Enlightenment}}
The [[Reform movement in Judaism|reform movement]] grew out of dissatisfaction with several aspects of [[Orthodox Judaism|traditional Judaism]] or [[Rabbinic Judaism]], as documented in [[polemics]] and other 19th- and early-20th-century writings.&lt;ref name="shmueli"&gt;Shmueli, Efraim (1990) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=uaU4NEWSvlQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Seven+Jewish%22+shmueli&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1VkpTL-PAsWisQaW7MTEBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Seven Jewish cultures: a reinterpretation of Jewish history and thought]''  Cambridge University Press, p. 123, 167-168, 172-174, 177, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Jacobs]], a prominent Masorti Rabbi, described the polemics between the Orthodox and the Reform movements as follows: {{quote|text="The polemics between Orthodox, as the traditionalists came to be called, and the Reformers were fierce.  The Orthodox treated Reform as rank heresy, as no more than a religion of convenience which, if followed, would lead Jews altogether out of Judaism.   The Reformers retorted that, on the contrary, the danger to Jewish survival was occasioned by the Orthodox who, through their obscurantism, failed to see that the new challenges facing Judaism had to be faced consciously in the present as Judaism had faced, albeit unconsciously, similar challenges in the past." |sign=Louis Jacobs|source=''The Jewish religion: a companion'', Oxford University Press, p. 4. (1995)}}
[[David Einhorn (rabbi)|David Einhorn]], an American Reform rabbi, calls Reform Judaism a "liberation" of Judaism : {{quote|text="There is at present a rent in Judaism which affects its very life, and which no covering, however glittering, can repair. The evil which threatens to corrode gradually all the healthy bone and marrow must be completely eradicated, and this can be done only if, in the name and in the interest of the religion, we remove from the sphere of our religious life all that is corrupt and untenable, and solemnly absolve ourselves from all obligations toward it in the future; thus we may achieve the liberation of Judaism for ourselves and for our children, so as to prevent the estrangement from Judaism."|sign=David Einhorn|source=Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'', Macmillan.}}

The criticisms of traditional Judaism included criticisms asserting that the Torah's laws are not strictly binding;&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Abraham Geiger ... stressed the belief in progress: the Bible and Talmud represent an early, primitive stage in a revelation that is still continuing.  Many traditional ceremonies (such as circumcision) are distressing to modern sensibility or incompatible with modern life... Geiger become increasingly convinced of the need to 'dethrone the Talmud'... " -  De Lange, Nicholas (2000),''An introduction to Judaism'',  Cambridge University Press,  p. 73
*"According to [Mordecai] Kaplan, the Jewish heritage, including the belief in God, must be reinterpreted so that it will be consistent with the intellectual outlook of the twentieth century. The Torah, which is Jewish civilization in practice, must be given a new functional interpretation." - Scult, Mel (1993) ''Judaism faces the twentieth century: a biography of Mordecai M. Kaplan'', Wayne State University Press, p. 341.
*"Israel drew within herself, shunned the world, and lived apart. In her seclusion her  religion became her all.  The interpretation of the Law and the construction put upon the commandments tended toward the upholding of the letter rather than the spirit. ... Reform was born to protect the spirit of the Law, to place the spirit above the letter, to make the latter subservient to the former.... The abolition of those forms and ceremonies that were not conducive to proper living, or that had, by reason of altered environment, become meaningless, was of the highest importance to the spiritual welfare of Israel." - Stern, Myer (1895), ''The rise and progress of reform Judaism: '', Harvard University, p. 5.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that many ceremonies and rituals are not necessary;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Reform Judaism rejected the concept of Divine revelation, and ... the law is considered instructional and inspirational but not binding, ... and by eliminating many ritual practices..." -  Dosick, Wayne D. (1995), ''Living Judaism: the complete guide to Jewish belief, tradition, and practice'', HarperCollins, p. 62.
*"Reform Judaism first took hold in Germany in the early nineteenth century.  This tradition asserts that many of the ritualistic practices and dogmas of the past are outmoded..... Reform Jews assumed a prerogative to choose which Biblical laws were worthy of their allegiance and which were not.... Orthodox Jews adhere to a literal interpretation of the Hebrew Bible and continue to observe all the traditional Jewish laws... Conservative Jews ... were ... less likely than the Orthodox to accept the infallibility of sacred texts asserting that 'the divine origin of Jewish law ... [was subject] to human development and application'". - Berger, Ronald J. (2002), ''Fathoming the Holocaust: a social problems approach'', Aldine Transaction, p. 179-180.
*"We hold that all such Mosaic and rabbinical laws as regulate diet, priestly purity, and dress originated in ages and under the influence of ideas entirely foreign to our present mental and spiritual state. They fail to impress the modern Jew with a spirit of priestly holiness; their observance in our days is apt rather to obstruct than to further modern spiritual elevation." - [[Pittsburgh Platform]], section 4.
*"...in the view of rabbinical Judaism every command of the written law in the Pentateuch (Torah sh'bikthab), and of the oral law (Torah sh'b'al peh), as codified in the Shulchan Aruk, is equally binding. The ceremonial law has equal potency with the religious and moral commands. Reform Judaism, on the other hand, claims that a distinction must be made between the universal precepts of religion and morality and the enactments arising from the circumstances and conditions of special times and places. Customs and ceremonies must change with the varying needs of different generations. Successive ages have their individual requirements for the satisfaction of the religious nature. No ceremonial law can be eternally binding. " -  Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Macmillan (reprinted by University of California, 2007), p. 5-6.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that Rabbinical leadership is too authoritarian;&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
*".. the immense authoritarian power of the orthodox Rabbis and Hasidic Zadikkim in the traditionalist communities ... As a result, there was open conflict between the rebellious youth .. and the religious establishment.... This was the context in which a virulent 'anti-clericalism' developed among progressive Jewish intellectuals, leaving countless evidence in the shape of polemical articles, autobiographical works, and imaginative literature." - Lowy, Michael (1992), ''Redemption and utopia: Jewish libertarian thought in Central Europe : a study in elective affinity'', Stanford University Press, p. 45.
*"[Reform Judaism was] founded as a response by Jewish laity to the perceived authoritarian rigidity of traditional or Orthodox Judaism and its rabbis." - Palmer-Fernández, Gabriel (2004), ''The encyclopedia of religion and war'', Routledge,  p. 253.
*"Mosaism and rabbinic Judaism were appropriate for earlier ages, [Kohler] argued.  But the age of man's maturity called for freedom from the letter, from blind authority, 'from all restriction which curb the minds and encroach upon the hearts'.  The contemporary Jew had 'outgrown the guiding strings ... of infancy'; he was ready to walk on his own.  What he required was not law, but a 'living Judaism', both enlightened and pious, appealing to reason and emotion." - Meyer, Michael A. (1995)  ''Response to modernity: a history of the Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Wayne State University Press, p. 267.
*"There is a fatal split among Jews, first, because religious tenets and institutions have been kept forcibly on a level of a vanished era, and not permeated with the divine breath of refreshing life, while life itself hurried forward stormily; and secondly, because the religious leaders, lacking all knowledge of the world and of men, dreamed of other times and conditions, and held themselves aloof from the life of the new generation - hence resulted a superficial rationalism, inimical to all positive and historical faith, side by side with a rigid, unreasoning formalism". -  Philipson, David (1907) ''The Reform Movement in Judaism'',  Macmillan (reprinted by University of California, 2007), (quoting Abraham Kohn, rabbi of Hohemems in Tirol); p. 93-95.
&lt;/ref&gt; criticisms asserting that there was too much superstition;  criticisms asserting that traditional Judaism leads to isolation from other communities;&lt;ref&gt;

*"Emancipation implied the breakdown of the Jews' millennial social and cultural isolation ... It was said for the first time in European history the Jews could participate in non-Jewish culture without the stigma of apostacy". {{cite book

}}

*"Sociologically, the way of life of halakhic Judaism vouchsafed Jewry to an unambiguously distinct ... identity - an identity that was the source of a profound discomfort to those Jews who sought cultural, social, and political integration in the Gentile community in which they lived." - ''The Jew in the modern world: a documentary history'' Paul R. Mendes-Flohr (Ed.),  p. 156
&lt;/ref&gt; and criticisms asserting that traditional Judaism over-emphasized the exile.&lt;ref name="shmueli"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
*" We recognize, in the modern era of universal culture of heart and intellect, the approaching of the realization of Israels great Messianic hope for the establishment of the kingdom of truth, justice, and peace among all men. We consider ourselves no longer a nation, but a religious community, and therefore expect neither a return to Palestine, nor a sacrificial worship under the sons of Aaron, nor the restoration of any of the laws concerning the Jewish state." - [[Pittsburgh Platform]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these criticisms were anticipated in a much earlier time, by philosopher [[Uriel da Costa]] (1585–1640) who criticized the Rabbinic authorities and the Talmud for lack of authenticity and spirituality.&lt;ref name="Spinozalife"/&gt;

==Criticism from Christianity==

===Paul's criticism of Judaism===
{{main|New Perspective on Paul|Paul the Apostle and Judaism|Pauline Christianity}}
[[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] criticizes Jews for their failure to believe that [[Jesus]] was the [[Messiah]] (Romans 9:30–10:13) and for their view about their favored status and lack of equality with [[gentiles]] (Roman 3:27).&lt;ref&gt;[[E. P. Sanders]], Paul the Law and Jewish People,  Fortress Press, p.154&lt;/ref&gt; In Romans 7–12, one criticism of Judaism made by Paul is that it is a religion based in law instead of faith. In many interpretations of this criticism made prior to the mid 20th century, Judaism was held to be fundamentally flawed by the sin of self-righteousness.&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; The issue is complicated by differences in the versions of Judaism extant at the time. Some scholars argue that Paul's criticism of Judaism are correct, others suggest that Paul's criticism is directed at [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic]] Judaism, the forms with which Paul was most familiar,&lt;ref name="sanders_1977"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the question as to whom Paul was addressing. Paul saw himself as an apostle to the Gentiles, and it is unclear as to whether the text of Romans was directed to Jewish followers of Jesus (as was Paul), to Gentiles, or to both.&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; If adherence to Jewish law were a requirement for salvation, then salvation would be denied to Gentiles without a conversion to Judaism.&lt;ref name="sanders_1983"/&gt; Krister Stendahl argues along similar lines that according to Paul, Judaism's rejection of Jesus as a savior is what allows salvation of non-Jews, that this rejection is part of God's overall plan, and that Israel will also be saved (per [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+11%3A26-27&amp;version=KJV Romans 11:26–27]).&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"&gt;

Some scholars argue that the fundamental issue underlying Paul's criticism of Judaism hinges on his understanding of Judaism's relationship to Jewish law. E. P. Sanders, for example, argues that the view held by many New Testament scholars from Weber on,&lt;ref name="zetterholm_2009"/&gt; represent a caricature of Judaism and that this interpretation of Paul's criticism is thus flawed by the misunderstanding of the tenets of Judaism.&lt;ref name="gorman_2004"&gt;

===Regarding the death of Jesus===
{{Main|Jewish deicide|Antisemitic canard}}
The idea that Judaism, and the Jewish people collectively, are responsible for the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|death of Jesus]], often represented in the claim that "Jews killed Jesus", figures prominently in anti-Semitic writings. It was initially stated by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] in the [[New Testament]] ({{bibleverse|1|Thes.|2:14-15|49}}).&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Roman Catholic church]] formally disavowed its long complicity in anti-Semitism by issuing a [[Nostra Aetate|proclamation]] in 1965 repudiating the notion  that the Jewish people bore any guilt for Jesus's death.

==Criticism from Islam==
A prominent place in the [[Qur'an]]ic polemic against the Jews is given to the conception of the religion of [[Abraham]]. The Qur'an presents Muslims as neither Jews nor Christians but followers of Abraham who was in a physical sense the father of the Jews and the Arabs and lived before the revelation of [[Torah]]. In order to show that the religion practiced by the Jews is not the pure religion of Abraham, the Qur'an mentions the incident of worshiping of the calf, argues that Jews do not believe in part of the revelation given to them, and that their taking of usury shows their worldliness and disobedience of God. Furthermore, the Quran claims they attribute to God what he has not revealed. According to the [[Qur'an]], the Jews exalted a figure named [[Uzair]] as the "son of God" (see the [[Uzair#Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation|Quranic statements about perceived Jewish exaltation]]). The character of [[Ezra]], who was presumed to be the figure mentioned by the Qur'an (albeit with no corroborative evidence to suggest Ezra and Uzair to be the same person) became important in the works of the later Andalusian Muslim scholar [[Ibn Hazm]], who explicitly accused Ezra of being a liar and a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text. In his polemic against Judaism, Ibn Hazm provided a list of what he said were chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission ([[tawatur]]) of the text.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, Uzayr&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoI-Tahrif"&gt;Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, ''Tahrif'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; Heribert Busse writes "The only explanation is the presumption that Muhammad, in the heat of debate, wanted to accuse the Jews of heretical doctrine on a par with the heresy of the Christian doctrine that teaches the divine nature of Jesus. In doing so, he could take advantage of the high esteem granted Ezra in Judaism."&lt;ref name=Busse1998p57&gt;Busse, Heribert.

==Philosophical criticism==

Philosophical criticism of Judaism is either part of [[criticism of religion|religious criticism]] in general, or specifically focused on aspects unique to the Jewish religion. [[Immanuel Kant]] is an example of the latter. Kant believed that Judaism fails to "satisfy the essential criteria of [a] religion" by requiring external obedience to moral laws, having a secular focus, and lacking a concern for [[Afterlife#Judaism|immortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10705.html|title=Kant, Immanuel|author=[[Manfred H. Vogel]] |publisher=Virtual Jewish Library|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shechitah (Kosher slaughter)===
[[Shechita|Kosher slaughter]] has historically attracted criticism from non-Jews as allegedly being inhumane and unsanitary,&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland&gt;{{Cite book|title=No way out: the politics of Polish Jewry, 1935–1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=co3KJikOaBYC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Emanuel|last=Melzer|pages=81–90|year=1997|publisher=Hebrew Union College Press|isbn=0-87820-418-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in part as an [[antisemitic canard]] that eating ritually slaughtered meat caused degeneration,&lt;ref name=Poliakov&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Anti-semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w39m4aohL9gC&amp;pg=PA153#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Léon|last=Poliakov|page=153|year=1968|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=0-8122-3766-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in part out of economic motivation to remove Jews from the meat industry.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; Sometimes, however, these criticisms were directed at Judaism as a religion. In 1893, animal advocates campaigning against kosher slaughter in Aberdeen attempted to link cruelty with Jewish religious practice.&lt;ref name=Aberdeen&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A Community on Trial: The Aberdeen Shechita Case, 1893|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2010.0103|first=Kenneth|last=Collins|journal=[[Journal of Scottish Historical Studies]]|volume=30|page=75|date=November 2010|doi=10.3366/jshs.2010.0103}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Polish critics of kosher slaughter claimed that the practice actually had no basis in scripture.&lt;ref name=Shechita-Poland/&gt; In contrast, Jewish authorities argue that the slaughter methods are based directly upon ({{bibleverse||Deut.|12:21|HE||}}), and that "these laws are binding on Jews today."&lt;ref name=Chabad2/&gt;

More recently, kosher slaughter has attracted criticism from some groups concerned with [[animal welfare]], who contend that the absence of any form of [[anesthesia]] or stunning prior to the severance of the animal's [[jugular vein]] causes unnecessary pain and suffering. Calls for the abolition of kosher slaughter have been made in 2008 by Germany's federal chamber of veterinarians,&lt;ref name=Germany-Kosher&gt;

{{main article|Circumcision controversies|Ethics of circumcision}}

All the more did the law-observing Jews defy the edict of [[Antiochus Epiphanes]] prohibiting circumcision (I Macc. i. 48, 60; ii. 46); and the Jewish women showed their loyalty to the Law, even at the risk of their lives, by themselves circumcising their sons.";&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hodges2001&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hodges| first = Frederick, M.| year = 2001| title = The Ideal Prepuce in Ancient Greece and Rome: Male Genital Aesthetics and Their Relation to Lipodermos, Circumcision, Foreskin Restoration, and the Kynodesme| journal = The Bulletin of the History of Medicine| volume = 75| issue = Fall 2001| pages = 375–405| url = http://www.cirp.org/library/history/hodges2/| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-07-24| doi = 10.1353/bhm.2001.0119| pmid=11568485}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Roman Empire]], circumcision was regarded as a barbaric and disgusting custom.  According to the [[Talmud]], the consul [[Titus Flavius Clemens (consul)|Titus Flavius Clemens]] was condemned to death by the [[Roman Senate]] in 95 CE for circumcising himself and [[Conversion to Judaism|converting to Judaism]]. The emperor [[Hadrian]] (117-138) forbade circumcision.&lt;ref name=Hodges2001/&gt;
[[Apostle Paul|Paul]] expressed similar sentiments about circumcision, calling it "mutilation" in Philippians 3. "Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3&amp;version=NIV Philippians 3:2]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Datura innoxia fruit split open.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''D. innoxia'' with ripe, split-open fruit]]

''Datura innoxia'' is an [[annual plant|annual]] [[shrub]]by plant that typically reaches a height of 0.6 to 1.5 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.plant-world-seeds.com/store/view_seed_item/2542|title=Datura inoxia_Plant World Seeds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.treknature.com/gallery/Asia/India/East/West_Bengal/Hooghly/photo259440.htm|title=Datura inoxia_TrekNature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[Plant stem|stems]] and [[leaf|leaves]] are covered with short and soft [[gray (color)|gray]]ish hairs, giving the whole plant a grayish appearance. It has [[Leaf shape|elliptic]] [[Leaf#Margins (edge)|smooth-edged]] leaves with [[Pinnation|pinnate]] venation. All parts of the plant emit a foul odor similar to rancid peanut butter when crushed or bruised, although most people find the fragrance of the flowers to be quite pleasant when they bloom at night.&lt;ref name=DIIJSR&gt;{{cite journal |last=Annapoorani|first=S. Grace|title=An Eco-Friendly Antimicrobial Finish Using Datura Innoxia and Leucas Aspera on Cotton Fabric |journal=International Journal of Scientific Research(IJSR)|date=April 2013 |volume=2 |issue=4|url=http://theglobaljournals.com/ijsr/file.php?val=Nzg2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The flowers are [[white]], [[trumpet]]-shaped, {{convert|12|–|19|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://eol.org/pages/487967/details|title=Datura inoxia_Desert Thornapple_EOL}}&lt;/ref&gt; They first grow upright, and later incline downward. It flowers from early summer until late fall.

The fruit is an [[Oval (geometry)|egg-shaped]] spiny [[capsule (fruit)|capsule]], about 5&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter. It splits open when ripe, dispersing the seeds. Another means of [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is by the fruit spines getting caught in the [[fur]] of animals, who then carry the fruit far from the mother plant. The seeds have [[seed hibernation|hibernation]] capabilities, and can last for years in the soil. The seeds, as well as the entirety of this plant, act as [[deliriants]], but have a high probability of [[overdose]].

==Nomenclature==
The currently-accepted botanical name for this plant is ''Datura innoxia'', in spite of the fact that many references spell it ''Datura inoxia''. According to [[Tropicos]], a widely-accepted authority on botanical names, the ''inoxia'' form is due to an error originally made by 18th century taxonomist [[Philip Miller]], and since corrected. Modern authorities state that the ''inoxia'' form literally means "not noxious", which certainly does not seem to apply to the highly poisonous ''Datura''.&lt;ref name="Tropicos"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tropicos.org/Name/29600166 |title=Tropicos / Name - !Datura innoxia Mill |website=Tropicos website |publisher=[[Missouri Botanical Garden]] |accessdate=2017-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LifeCatalog"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catalogueoflife.org/col/details/species/id/f78459611a04e57ef4ee69db20086be1 |title=Catalogue of Life: Datura innoxia P. miller |website=Catalogue of Life website |publisher=[[Catalogue of Life]] |date=2017-02-27 |accessdate=2017-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Miller said that the "not noxious" form refers to the soft spines on the fruit, which are in contrast to the sharp spines on other ''Datura'' species. (Miller refers to the ... "oval fruit, covered with long, soft, innocent spines" ...).&lt;ref&gt;Philip Miler. The Gardeners Dictionary: . . . eighth edition Datura no. 5. 1768. [https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/394481#page/372]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Datura#Toxicity|l1=Datura (Toxicity)}}
All parts of ''Datura'' plants contain dangerous levels of poison and may be fatal if ingested by humans and other animals, including livestock and pets. In some places it is prohibited to buy, sell or cultivate ''Datura'' plants.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

==Cultivation and uses==
When [[Plant cultivation|cultivated]], the plant is usually grown from seed, but its [[perennial]] [[rhizomes]] can be kept from freezing and planted in the spring of the following year.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt;

''Datura innoxia'', like other ''Datura'' species, contains the highly toxic [[alkaloid]]s [[atropine]], [[hyoscine]] (scopolamine), and [[hyoscyamine]]. The Aztecs called the plant ''toloatzin'', and used it long before the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] for many therapeutic purposes, such as [[poultice]]s for wounds where it acts as an [[anodyne]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Although the Aztecs warned against madness and "various and vain imaginings", many Native Americans have used the plant as an [[Aztec entheogenic complex|entheogen]] for hallucinations and rites of passage. The alkaloids of these plants are very similar to those of [[Mandragora officinarum|mandrake]], [[deadly nightshade]], and [[henbane]], which are also highly poisonous plants used cautiously for effective pain relief in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1970-01-01_1_page005.html|title=The plant kingdom and hallucinogens (part III)|author=Richard Evans Schultes|date=1970-01-01|accessdate=2007-05-23|pages=25–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datura intoxication typically produces a complete inability to differentiate reality from fantasy (delirium, as contrasted to hallucination); [[hyperthermia]]; [[tachycardia]]; bizarre, and possibly violent behavior; and severe [[mydriasis]] with resultant painful [[photophobia]] that can last several days. Pronounced [[amnesia]] is another commonly reported effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura_effects.shtml|title=Erowid Datura Vault : Effects|website=[[Erowid]]|accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There can easily be a 5:1 variation in toxins from plant to plant, and a given plant's toxicity depends on its age, where it is growing, and local weather conditions. These wide variations make ''Datura'' exceptionally hazardous to use as a drug. In traditional cultures, users needed to have a great deal of experience and detailed plant knowledge so that no harm resulted from using it.&lt;ref name="Preissel"/&gt; Such knowledge is not widely available in modern cultures, so many unfortunate incidents result from ingesting ''Datura''. In the 1990s and 2000s, the United States media contained stories of [[adolescent]]s and young adults dying or becoming seriously ill from intentionally ingesting ''Datura''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5233a2.htm |title = Suspected Moonflower Intoxication (Ohio, 2002)| accessdate = September 30, 2006| publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been planted throughout the world as an [[ornamental plant]] for its attractive large leaves, large white flowers, and distinctive thorny fruit. However, the plant is now considered an [[invasive species]] in several locations. For example, because of the similarity of its [[biological life cycle|life cycle]] to that of [[Gossypium|cotton]], it is a pest in cotton fields. It is also a potential [[seed contamination|seed contaminant]].

==Similar species==
''Datura innoxia'' is quite similar to [[Datura metel|''D. metel'']], to the point of being confused with it in early scientific literature.  ''D. metel'' is a closely related Old World plant for which similar effects were described by [[Avicenna]] in eleventh century [[Persia]]. The closely related [[Datura stramonium|''D. stramonium'']] differs in having smaller flowers and tooth-edged leaves, and [[Datura wrightii|''D. wrightii'']] in having wider, 5-toothed (instead of 10-toothed) flowers. ''D. innoxia'' differs from ''D. stramonium'', ''D. metel'' &amp; ''D. fastuosa'' in having about 7 to 10 secondary veins on either side of the midrib of the leaf which anastomose by arches at about 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm. from the margin. No [[anastomosis]] of the secondary veins are seen in the other 4 major species of ''Datura''.

[[File:Claustro-Monasterio Santa Teresa de Jesús.JPG|thumb|Enclosed [[Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] nuns]]
'''Enclosed religious orders''' of the [[Christianity|Christian]] churches have [[solemn vows]] with a strict separation from the affairs of the external world. The term ''[[cloistered]]'' is synonymous with ''enclosed''. In the [[Catholic Church]] enclosure is regulated by the code of [[canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]], either the [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Latin code]] or the [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches|Oriental code]], and also by subsidiary legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/ccscrlife/documents/rc_con_ccscrlife_doc_13051999_verbi-sponsa_en.html VATICAN: ''Verbi Sponsa'' - Instruction on the Contemplative Life and on the Enclosure of Nuns]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Code of Canon Law"&gt;The Code of Canon Law, Canon 667 ff.&lt;cite&gt; English translation copyright 1983 The Canon Law Society Trust&lt;/cite&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.deacons.net/Canon_Law/cci.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 June 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619055307/http://www.deacons.net/Canon_Law/cci.htm |archivedate=19 June 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Enforced in the past with a largely uniform severity, at least in the case of women, it is now practised with a wider variety of custom according to the nature and [[charism]] of the community in question.

The stated purpose for such enclosure is to prevent distraction from prayer and the religious life. Depending upon the reason and the length of time, the proper authority (usually the superior gets approval from the local [[Bishop in the Catholic Church|bishop]] or the [[Holy See]]) can allow enclosed men or women to leave the enclosure "for a grave cause and with the consent of the superior". In the Catholic Church, this matter is regulated within the framework of canon law&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Iuris Canonici'' Can. 637, § 4&lt;/ref&gt; and of the particular statutes approved by the Holy See.

Enclosed religious orders of men include monks following the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]], namely the [[Benedictines]], the [[Cistercians]], and the [[Trappists]] Order, but also monks of the [[Carthusians]], [[Hieronymites]] monks, and some branches of [[Carmelites]], along with members of the [[Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno|Monastic Family of Bethlehem]], while enclosed religious orders of women include [[Canonesses|Canonesses Regular]], nuns belonging to the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]], [[Cistercians|Cistercian]], [[Trappists|Trappist]] and the [[Carthusian]] Orders, along with nuns of the [[Second Order (religious)|second order]] of each of the mendicant orders, including: the [[Poor Clare]]s, the [[Colettine Poor Clares]], the [[Capuchin Poor Clares]], the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Carmelites]], [[Order of Servites|Servites]], [[Augustinians]], [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]], together with the [[Conceptionists|Conceptionist]] nuns, the [[Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary|Visitandine]] nuns, [[Ursulines]] nuns (as distinct from "federated Ursulines" of the [[Company of St. Ursula]]) and women members of the [[Monastic Family of Bethlehem, of the Assumption of the Virgin and of Saint Bruno|Monastic Family of Bethlehem]].

==Contemplative orders==
The English word [[monk]] most properly refers to men in monastic life, while the term [[friar]] more properly refers to [[mendicants]] active in the broader world (like [[Franciscans]], Dominicans and Augustinians), though not all monasteries require strict enclosure. [[Benedictines|Benedictine monks]], for instance, have often staffed parishes and been allowed to leave monastery confines.

Although the English word [[nun]] is often used to describe all Christian women who have joined [[religious institute]]s, strictly speaking, women are referred to as nuns only when they live in papal enclosure; otherwise, they are [[Religious Sister#Distinction between a nun and a religious sister|religious sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/catholic-contributions/the-meaning-of-the-terms-nun-sister-monk-priest-and-brother.html|title=The Meaning of the Terms Nun, Sister, Monk, Priest, and Brother|last=Saunders|first=William|date=2003|work=Catholic Education Resource Center|access-date=2018-05-28|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinctions between the Christian terms monk, nun, friar, Brother, and Sister are sometimes easily blurred because some orders (such as the Dominicans or Augustinians) include nuns who are enclosed, who are usually grouped as the [[Second Order (religious)|Second Order]] of that movement, and Religious Sisters who work in the broader world, who form a part of its [[Third Order]].

==Exclaustration==
In the [[Roman Rite]] of the [[Catholic Church]], once a man or woman has made solemn, perpetual [[religious vows]], the release from these monastic vows has to be approved by the [[ecclesiastical]] authorities. Normally there is a transitional period, called [[exclaustration]], in which the person looks to establish a new life and determine if this is what he or she is truly called to do. This usually lasts up to six years under the current [[Code of Canon Law]]. After this period the appropriate authority, generally the [[Holy See]], determines that the wish to leave this life is valid and grants the former monk or nun release from their vows.

[[Lutheran]] and [[Anglican]] religious orders have different procedures for the release from perpetual vows.

'''Gaushalas''' or '''Goshalas''' are protective shelters for [[cows]] in India. Goshalas focus on treating cows well, because of their religious significance in [[Hinduism]] and consequent cultural sensitivity towards their welfare.

== Description ==
Goshala, a [[Sanskrit]] word ("Go" means cow and "Shala" means a shelter place: Go + Shala = shelter for cows), means the abode or [[sanctuary]] for cows, calves and oxen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2001-08-17/bangalore/27235240_1_goshala-cattle-fodder |title=300 cattle head for goshala everyday |work=[[Times Of India]] |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from providing sanctuary, the Goshala also rescues the animals [[Cattle slaughter in India|destined for illegal slaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19990524/ige24154.html |title=Setting up of gaushala in Kharar ordered |work=[[Express India]] |date=1999-05-24 |accessdate=2013-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050430173239/http://www.expressindia.com/ie/daily/19990524/ige24154.html |archivedate=2005-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
India's first goshala is thought to have been established in [[Rewari]] by Rao Yudhishter Singh Yadav.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020428/ncr1.htm |title=In stoic silence, historical tanks of Rewari await tourists |first=Nawal Kishore |last=Rastogi |work=[[Tribune India]] |date=2002-04-27 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mittal1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Satish Chandra Mittal|title=Haryana, a Historical Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2RKTigrrP1cC&amp;pg=PP4|year=1986|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distri|pages=4–|id=GGKEY:WZ4ZX97B5N2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are now goshalas all over India.

The first ''Gaurakshini sabha'' ([[cow protection movement|cow protection society]]) was established in the Punjab in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;''The Making of an Indian Metropolis, Colonial governance and public culture in Bombay, 1890/1920'', Prashant Kidambi, p. 176, {{ISBN|978-0-7546-5612-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The movement spread rapidly all over [[North India]] and to Bengal, Bombay, Madras presidencies and other [[Central Provinces|central provinces]].  The organization rescued wandering cows and reclaimed them to groom them in places called gaushalas. Charitable networks developed all through North India to collect rice from individuals, pool the contributions, and re-sell them to fund the ''gaushalas''. Signatures, up to 350,000 in some places, were collected to demand a ban on cow sacrifice.&lt;ref name="Vishnu pp. 67-69"&gt;''Vishnu's crowded temple, India since the great rebellion'', pp. 67-69, Maria Misra, 2008, Yale University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13721-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1880 and 1893, hundreds of ''gaushalas'' were opened.&lt;ref name="ChapISec10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dahd.nic.in/dahd/reports/report-of-the-national-commission-on-cattle/chapter-i-introduction.aspx#item10|title=Report of the National Commission on Cattle - Chapter I (10.

The UK's only Goshala is ''New Gokul'', located at the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]] temple in [[Bhaktivedanta Manor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.iskcon.org/grand-opening-of-the-five-star-hilton-for-krishna-cows,2298/ |title=Grand Opening Of The Five Star Hilton For Krishna Cows |publisher=[[ISKCON News]] |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vina.cc/news/index.php/General/New-Gokul.html |title=New Farm Complex at Bhaktivedanta Manor |first=Radha Mohan |last=Das |publisher=Vina.cc |date=2010-11-13 |accessdate=2014-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106214903/http://www.vina.cc/news/index.php/General/New-Gokul.html |archivedate=2014-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States of America  ===
The USA's first Goshala started at Gita Nagari Farm and Sanctuary, located in Port Royal, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theyogafarm.com/2016/05/working-farm-retreats-at-gita-nagari.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Another major Goshala is operating in Florida under the name International Society for Cow Protection (ISCOWP).

Goshala in Arizona:
It was established on April 7, 2010 in Maricopa, and later relocated in San Tan Valley, since February 1, 2012.;&lt;ref&gt;https://issuu.com/timespub/docs/1016_se_mesa_book/1?e=8633901/39735650&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/azgoshala/?fref=ts&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government support ==
Between 2014 and 2016 the Indian government spent 5.8 billion rupees (US$87 million) on cow shelters.&lt;ref name=Bloomb1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-17/cow-urine-can-sell-for-more-than-milk-in-india |title=Cow urine can sell for more than milk in India |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date=2016-07-18 |accessdate=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prevent unproductive cows being sent to the abattoir, the government started the Rashtriya Gokul Mission in mid-2014, a national program that involves constructing havens for retired cows. Proceeds from the animals’ bodily waste are intended to pay for their upkeep.
In May 2016 the Indian national government held an inaugural national conference on goshalas.

'''Hermann Georg Jacobi''' (11 February 1850 – 19 October 1937) was an eminent German [[Indologist]].

==Education==
Jacobi was born in [[Köln]] (Cologne)&lt;ref name=nie&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Jacobi, Hermann Georg|year=1905}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 11 February 1850. He was educated in the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] of Cologne&lt;ref name=amer&gt;{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Jacobi, Herman Georg Jakob|year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then went to the [[University of Berlin]], where initially he studied mathematics, but later, probably under the influence of [[Albrecht Weber]], switched to [[Sanskrit]] and comparative linguistics, which he studied under Weber and [[Johann Gildemeister]].&lt;ref name=nie/&gt; He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] from the [[University of Bonn]]. The subject of his thesis, written in 1872, was the origin of the term [[Hora (astrology)|"hora"]] in Indian astrology.

Jacobi was able to visit London for a year, 1872-1873, where he examined the Indian manuscripts available there. The next year, with [[Georg Buehler]], he visited [[Rajasthan]], [[India]], where manuscripts were being collected.&lt;ref name=jdict&gt;
{{citation | year=2004 | title = Historical dictionary of Jainism | author1=Kristi L. Wiley | publisher=Rowman &amp;amp; Littlefield | isbn=978-0-8108-5051-4 | page=99 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XubfClGnIAUC&amp;pg=PA99&amp;dq=jacobi}}
&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Jaisalmer Library]], he came across [[Jain]] Manuscripts, which were of abiding interest to him for the rest of his life. He later edited and translated many of them, both into German and English, including those for [[Max Mueller]]'s [[Sacred Books of the East]].

==Academic appointments==
In 1875, he became a [[Privatdocent|docent]] in Sanskrit at Bonn; from 1876-85 was [[professor]] extraordinarius of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology at [[University of Münster|Münster]], Westphalia; in 1885 was made professor ordinarius of Sanskrit at [[University of Kiel|Kiel]]; and in 1889 was appointed professor of Sanskrit at Bonn.&lt;ref name=nie/&gt;&lt;ref name="amer"/&gt; He served as professor in Bonn until his retirement in 1922. After his retirement, Jacobi remained active, lecturing and writing till his death in 1937.

==Work==
Apart from Jaina studies, Jacobi was interested in Indian mathematics, astrology and the natural sciences, and using astronomical information available in the [[Vedas]], he tried to establish the date of their composition. Like [[Alexander Cunningham]] before him he tried to systematise how, from the evidence available in inscriptions, a true local time could be arrived at.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Jacobi's studies in astronomy have regained importance today in the context of the [[Out of India theory]], because his calculations led him to believe that the hymns of the [[Rigveda]] were to be dated as early as 4500 B.C. Thus he is the only renowned Western Indologist whose research supports the claim of the proponents of the theory that the Vedas are to be dated back much earlier than the first half of the second millennium B.C. According to mainstream Indology,  the [[Indo-Aryan Migration]] took place during this period of time and the Vedas were only composed after the migration. When Jacobi published his views in an article on the origin of Vedic culture in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1908), he therefore triggered off a major controversy in Indology.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In his later life, Jacobi interested himself in Poetry, Epics and Philosophy, particularly the school of Nyaya-Vaisheshika.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
It is said that Jacobi was greatly influenced by Jain Philosophy and wished to be a Jain in his next life.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Honors==
Among the honours he received were a doctorate from the [[University of Calcutta]] where he had gone in the winter of 1913-14 to lecture on poetics, while the Jain community conferred the title Jain Darshan Divakar — Sun of the Jain doctrine — upon him.

===History===
Islam first arrived in Burundi from [[East Africa]]n coast as part of the [[Arab slave trade]] in the late 19th century.{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} The Arabs were prevented from entering the [[Kingdom of Burundi]] by a successful campaign of resistance led by ''[[mwami]]'' (king) [[Mwezi IV Gisabo of Burundi|Mwezi IV Gisabo]].{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} However, they did establish settlements at [[Ujiji]] and [[Uvira]] close to the country's current borders.{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} The number of Muslims in Burundi increased under [[German East Africa|German colonial rule]] (1894–1916) and the German administration favoured the use of [[Swahili language|Kiswahili]] which was widely associated with the country's Muslims. By the outbreak of [[World War I]], the capital [[Bujumbura]] (then Usumbura) was a majority Muslim city.{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} The religion declined under [[Ruanda-Urundi|Belgian colonial rule]] (1916–62) as a result of the spread of [[Catholicism]] and the migration of non-Muslim Burundians to the cities.{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}}

===Today===
Today the Muslim population is strongly urbanised and focused in the cities of Bujumbura, especially in the [[Commune of Buyenzi|communes of Buyenzi]] and [[Commune of Bwiza|Bwiza]], as well as [[Gitega]], [[Rumonge]], [[Nyanza Lac|Nyanza]], [[Muyinga]], and [[Makamba, Burundi|Makamba]]. The great majority are [[Sunni]] while a small minority are [[Shia]] and [[Ibadi]].&lt;ref name="state2010"/&gt;{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} Most are Swahili speakers although they may speak other [[Languages of Burundi|national languages]].{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} A significant proportion of the Muslim community are recent immigrants to the country from [[West Africa]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Middle East]], and [[Pakistan]].{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}} Native Burundian Muslims belong to both of the country's major ethnic groups ([[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]]) and successfully managed to avoid become involved in the [[Burundian genocides]] and ethnic violence since independence.{{sfn|Luffin|1999|p=29}}

The Republic of Burundi is [[Religion in Burundi|officially secular]] but several Muslim festivals, including [[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], are celebrated as [[Public holidays in Burundi|national holidays]] alongside Christian observances.&lt;ref name="state2010"/&gt; Despite being only a small proportion of the national population, Muslims are represented in senior positions in Burundian politics and society, especially since the end of the [[Burundian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Despite small numbers, Burundi Muslims still influential|url=http://www.worldbulletin.net/news/159752/despite-small-numbers-burundi-muslims-still-influential|date=26 May 2015|publisher=World Bulletin|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israelites''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɪ|z|r|i|ə|l|aɪ|t|s}}; {{lang-he|בני ישראל}} ''Bnei Yisra'el'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/israelite "Israelite"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; were a confederation of [[Iron Age]] [[ancient Semitic-speaking peoples|Semitic-speaking tribes]] of the [[ancient Near East]], who inhabited a part of [[Canaan]] during the [[history of ancient Israel and Judah|tribal and monarchic periods]].&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Israel. "Ethnicity and origin of the Iron I settlers in the Highlands of Canaan: Can the real Israel stand up?." The Biblical archaeologist 59.4 (1996): 198–212.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, Israel.

The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Sacred Texts. Simon and Schuster, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the religious narrative of the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], the Israelites' origin is traced back to the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Biblical patriarchs]] and matriarchs [[Abraham]] and his wife [[Sarah]], through their son [[Isaac]] and his wife [[Rebecca]], and their son [[Jacob]] who was later called [[Israel (name)|Israel]], whence they derive their name, with his wives [[Leah]] and [[Rachel]] and the handmaids [[Zilpa]] and [[Bilhah]].

Modern [[archaeology]] has largely discarded the historicity of the religious narrative,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dever |first=William |title=What Did the Biblical Writers Know, and When Did They Know It? |year=2001 |publisher=Eerdmans |isbn=3-927120-37-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6-VxwC5rQtwC |pages=98–99 |quote=After a century of exhaustive investigation, all respectable archaeologists have given up hope of recovering any context that would make Abraham, Isaac, or Jacob credible "historical figures" [...] archaeological investigation of Moses and the Exodus has similarly been discarded as a fruitless pursuit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; with it being reframed as constituting an inspiring [[national myth]] narrative. The Israelites and their culture, according to the modern archaeological account, did not overtake the region by force, but instead branched out of the indigenous [[Canaanite languages|Canaanite peoples]] that long inhabited the [[Southern Levant]], [[History of Syria#Classical Antiquity|Syria]], [[ancient Israel]], and the [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan region]]&lt;ref name="Tubb 1998 13–14"&gt;{{harvnb|Tubb|1998|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mcnutt47 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. L. Noll, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2rnyjxLHy-QC&amp;pg=PA164 ''Canaan and Israel in Antiquity: An Introduction,''] A&amp;C Black, 2001 p. 164: "It would seem that, in the eyes of Merneptah's artisans, Israel was a Canaanite group indistinguishable from all other Canaanite groups." "It is likely that Merneptah's Israel was a group of Canaanites located in the Jezreel Valley."&lt;/ref&gt; through the development of a distinct [[monolatrism|monolatristic]]—later cementing as [[monotheism|monotheistic]]—religion centered on [[Yahweh]], one of the [[Canaanite pantheon|Ancient Canaanite deities]]. The outgrowth of Yahweh-centric belief, along with a number of [[Cult (religious practice)|cultic practices]], gradually gave rise to a distinct Israelite [[ethnic group]], setting them apart from other Canaanites.&lt;ref&gt;Tubb, 1998. pp. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Smith in "The Early History of God: Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel" states "Despite the long regnant model that the Canaanites and Israelites were people of fundamentally different culture, archaeological data now casts doubt on this view. The material culture of the region exhibits numerous common points between Israelites and Canaanites in the Iron I period (c. 1200–1000&amp;nbsp;BCE). The record would suggest that the Israelite culture largely overlapped with and derived from Canaanite culture... In short, Israelite culture was largely Canaanite in nature. Given the information available, one cannot maintain a radical cultural separation between Canaanites and Israelites for the Iron I period." (pp. 6–7). Smith, Mark (2002) "The Early History of God: Yahweh and Other Deities of Ancient Israel" (Eerdman's)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rendsberg, Gary (2008). "Israel without the Bible". In Frederick E. Greenspahn. The Hebrew Bible: New Insights and Scholarship. NYU Press, pp. 3–5&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Hebrew Bible]] the term ''Israelites'' is used interchangeably with the term ''[[Twelve Tribes of Israel]]''. Although related, the terms [[Hebrews]], Israelites, and [[Jews]] are not interchangeable in all instances. "Israelites" (''Yisraelim'') refers specifically to the direct descendants of any of the sons of the patriarch [[Jacob#Jewish tradition|Jacob]] (later called Israel), and his descendants as a people are also collectively called "Israel", including converts to their faith in worship of the [[God in Judaism|god of Israel]], [[Yahweh]]. "Hebrews" (''ʿIvrim''), on the contrary, is used to denote the Israelites' immediate forebears who dwelt in the [[land of Canaan]], the Israelites themselves, and the Israelites' ancient and modern descendants (including Jews and [[Samaritans]]). "Jews" (''Yehudim'') is used to denote the descendants of the Israelites who coalesced when the [[Tribe of Judah]] absorbed the remnants of various other Israelite tribes. Thus, for instance, Abraham was a Hebrew but he was not technically an Israelite nor a Jew, Jacob was both a Hebrew and the first Israelite but not a Jew, while [[David]] (as a member of the Tribe of Judah) was all three, a Hebrew, an Israelite, and a Judahite (''Yehudi'', Jew). A Samaritan, on the contrary, while being both a Hebrew and an Israelite, is not a Jew.

During the period of the divided monarchy "Israelites" was only used to refer to the inhabitants of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|northern Kingdom of Israel]], and it is only extended to cover the people of the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] in post-exilic usage.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L.Cate, "Israelite", in Watson E. Mills, Roger Aubrey Bullard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=goq0VWw9rGIC&amp;pg=PA420 ''Mercer Dictionary of the Bible,''] Mercer University Press, 1990 p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in [[Judaism]], the term "Israelite" is, broadly speaking, used to refer to a [[Layperson|lay]] member of the Jewish [[ethnoreligious group]], as opposed to the priestly orders of [[Kohanim]] and [[Levites]]. In texts of [[Jewish law]] such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Gemara]], the term יהודי (''Yehudi''), meaning Jew, is rarely used, and instead the ethnonym ישראלי (''Yisraeli''), or Israelite, is widely used to refer to Jews. Samaritans commonly refer to themselves and to Jews collectively as Israelites, and they describe themselves as the Israelite Samaritans.&lt;ref&gt;Yesaahq ben 'Aamraam.

==Etymology==
[[File:Merneptah Israel Stele Cairo.JPG|thumb|upright|The [[Merneptah stele]]. While alternative translations exist, the majority of [[Biblical archaeology|biblical archaeologists]] translate a set of hieroglyphs as ''Israel'', representing the first instance of the name Israel in the historical record.]]

The term ''Israelite'' is the English name for the descendants of the [[biblical patriarch]] [[Jacob]] in ancient times, which is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] Ισραηλίτες,&lt;ref&gt;Strong's Exhaustive Concordance G2474&lt;/ref&gt; which was used to translate the [[Biblical Hebrew]] term ''b'nei yisrael'', יִשְׂרָאֵל as either "sons of [[Jacob|Israel]]" or "children of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;Brown Drivers Briggs H3478&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Israel'' first appears in the [[Hebrew Bible]] in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|32:29|HE}}. It refers to the renaming of Jacob, who, according to the Bible, [[Jacob wrestling with the angel|wrestled with an angel]], who gave him a blessing and renamed him ''Israel'' because he had "striven with God and with men, and have prevailed". The Hebrew Bible etymologizes the name as from ''yisra'' "to prevail over" or "to struggle/wrestle with", and ''[[El (god)|el]]'', "[[God]], the divine".&lt;ref name="Scherman, Rabbi Nosson 2006, pages 176-77"&gt;Scherman, Rabbi Nosson (editor), ''The Chumash'', The Artscroll Series, Mesorah Publications, LTD, 2006, pp. 176–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan, Aryeh 1985, page 125"&gt;Kaplan, Aryeh, "Jewish Meditation", Schocken Books, New York, 1985, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Israel'' first appears in non-biblical sources c. 1209 BCE, in [[Merneptah stele|an inscription]] of the Egyptian pharaoh [[Merneptah]]. The inscription is very brief and says simply: "Israel is laid waste and his seed is not" (see below). The inscription refers to a people, not to an individual or a nation-state.&lt;ref name="Greenspahn2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick E. Greenspahn|title=The Hebrew Bible: New Insights and Scholarship|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=inRKaf_To5sC&amp;pg=PA12|year=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0-8147-3187-1|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hebrews|Assyrian captivity}}
In [[modern Hebrew]], ''b'nei yisrael'' ("children of Israel") can denote the [[Jewish people]] at any time in history; it is typically used to emphasize Jewish ethnic identity. From the period of the [[Mishna]] (but probably used before that period) the term ''Yisrael'' ("an Israel") acquired an additional narrower meaning of [[Jews]] of legitimate birth other than [[Levites]] and Aaronite priests (''[[kohen|kohanim]]''). In modern Hebrew this contrasts with the term ''Yisraeli'' (English "[[Israelis|Israeli]]"), a citizen of the modern State of [[Israel]], regardless of religion or ethnicity.

The term ''[[Hebrews|Hebrew]]'' has [[Eber]] as an [[eponym]]ous ancestor. It is used synonymously with "Israelites", or as an [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] term for historical speakers of the [[Hebrew language]] in general.

The Greek term ''[[Ioudaioi]]'' ([[Jew (word)|Jews]]) was an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] originally referring to members of the [[Tribe of Judah]], which formed the nucleus of the [[kingdom of Judah]], and was later adopted as a self-designation by people in the [[diaspora]] who identified themselves as loyal to the God of Israel and the Temple in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Johnson Hodge,[https://books.google.com/books?id=Kd6ImHYoNUsC&amp;pg=PA53 ''If Sons, Then Heirs: A Study of Kinship and Ethnicity in the Letters of Paul,''] Oxford University Press, 2007 pp. 52–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markus Cromhout,[https://books.google.com/books?id=apHXBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 ''Jesus and Identity: Reconstructing Judean Ethnicity in Q,''] James Clarke &amp; Co, 2015 pp. 121ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lynwood Smith,[https://books.google.com/books?id=Yi7aBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA124  ''Into the World of the New Testament: Greco-Roman and Jewish Texts and Contexts,''] Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015 p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Sharot,[https://books.google.com/books?id=EAMLEM4lYlAC&amp;pg=PA146 ''Comparative Perspectives on Judaisms and Jewish Identities,''] Wayne State University Press 2011 p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samaritans]], who claim descent from the tribes of [[Tribe of Ephraim|Ephraim]] and [[Tribe of Manasseh|Manasseh]] (plus [[Tribe of Levi|Levi]] through [[Aaron]] for [[kohen]]s), are named after the Israelite [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Samaria]], but until modern times many Jewish authorities contested their claimed lineage, deeming them to have been conquered foreigners who were [[Population transfer#Ancient world|settled]] in the Land of Israel by the Assyrians, as was the typical Assyrian policy to obliterate national identities. Today, Jews and Samaritans both recognize each other as communities with an authentic Israelite origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelite-samaritans.com/|title=Homepage of A.B Institute of Samaritan Studies|publisher=|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "Jews" and "Samaritans" largely replaced the title "Children of Israel"&lt;ref&gt;''Settings of silver: an introduction to Judaism'', Stephen M. Wylen, Paulist Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8091-3960-X}}, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; as the commonly used ethnonym for each respective community.

{{History of Israel}}
Several theories exist proposing the origins of the Israelites in raiding groups, infiltrating nomads or emerging from indigenous Canaanites driven from the wealthier urban areas by poverty to seek their fortunes in the highland.&lt;ref&gt;Israel Finkelstein, Neil Asher Silberman, ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', Simon and Schuster 2002, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Various, ethnically distinct groups of itinerant nomads such as the [[Habiru]] and [[Shasu]] recorded in Egyptian texts as active in [[Edom]] and Canaan could have been related to the later Israelites, which does not exclude the possibility that the majority may have had their origins in Canaan proper. The name [[Yahweh]], the god of the later Israelites, may indicate connections with the region of [[Mount Seir]] in Edom.&lt;ref name="Toorn" &gt;K. van der Toorn,[https://books.google.com/books?id=VSJWkrXfbLQC&amp;pg=PA282 ''Family Religion in Babylonia, Ugarit and Israel: Continuity and Changes in the Forms of Religious Life''], BRILL 1996 pp. 181, 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

The prevailing academic opinion today is that the Israelites were a mixture of peoples predominantly indigenous to Canaan, although an Egyptian matrix of peoples may also have played a role in their ethnogenesis,&lt;ref&gt;Alan Mittleman, "Judaism: Covenant, Pluralism and Piety", in Bryan S. Turner (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RheC7rG9u6gC&amp;pg=PA345 ''The New Blackwell Companion to the Sociology of Religion''], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010 pp. 340–63, 346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gottwald" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard A. Gabriel]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=72ZR9KCh9lUC&amp;pg=PA63 ''The Military History of Ancient Israel'']. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003 p. 63: The ethnically mixed character of the Israelites is reflected even more clearly in the foreign names of the group's leadership. Moses himself, of course, has an Egyptian name. But so do Hophni, Phinehas, Hur, and Merari, the son of Levi.&lt;/ref&gt; with an ethnic composition similar to that in [[Ammon]], [[Edom]] and [[Moab]],&lt;ref name="Gottwald"&gt;Norman Gottwald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L_dIEeMj2EYC&amp;pg=PA455 ''Tribes of Yahweh: A Sociology of the Religion of Liberated Israel, 1250–1050 BCE''], A&amp;C Black, 1999 p. 433, cf. 455–56&lt;/ref&gt; and including [[Habiru|Hapiru]] and [[Shasu|Šośu]].&lt;ref name="Paas"&gt;Stefan Paas, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lfF31IAuBtAC&amp;pg=PA114 ''Creation and Judgement: Creation Texts in Some Eighth Century Prophets'']. Brill, 2003 pp. 110–21, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The defining feature which marked them off from the surrounding societies was a staunch egalitarian organisation focused on Yahweh worship, rather than mere kinship.&lt;ref name="Gottwald" /&gt;

The language of the Canaanites may perhaps be best described as an "archaic form of Hebrew, standing in much the same relationship to the Hebrew of the Old Testament as does the language of Chaucer to modern English." The Canaanites were also the first people, as far as is known, to have used an [[alphabet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/91488/Canaan |title= Canaan |work= Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate= March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Israel first appears c. 1209 BCE, at the end of the [[Late Bronze Age]] and the very beginning of the period archaeologists and historians call [[Iron Age|Iron Age I]], on the [[Merneptah Stele]] raised by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Merneptah]]. The inscription is very brief:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Plundered is Canaan with every evil,
Carried off is Ashkelon,
Seized upon is Gezer,
Yeno&lt;sup&gt;c&lt;/sup&gt;am is made as that which does not exist
''Israel lies fallow, it has no seed'';
Ḫurru has become a widow because of Egypt.&lt;ref name="Toorn" /&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

As distinct from the cities named ([[Ashkelon]], [[Gezer]], [[Yenoam]]) which are written with a [[toponym|toponymic marker]], Israel is written [[hieroglyph]]ically with a [[demonym]]ic [[determinative]] indicating that the reference is to a human group, variously located in central Palestine&lt;ref name="Toorn" /&gt; or the highlands of [[Samaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Grabbe 2008, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next two hundred years (the period of Iron Age I) the number of [[Israelite highland settlement|highland villages]] increased from 25 to over 300&lt;ref name=mcnutt47&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; and the settled population doubled to 40,000.&lt;ref name=mcnutt70&gt;McNutt 1999, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 10th century BCE a rudimentary state had emerged in the north-central highlands,&lt;ref&gt;Joffe pp. 440ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 9th century this became a kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, 1992, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement in the southern highlands was minimal from the 12th through the 10th centuries BCE, but a state began to emerge there in the 9th century,&lt;ref&gt;Joffe pp. 448–49.&lt;/ref&gt; and from 850 BCE onwards a series of inscriptions are evidence of a kingdom which its neighbours refer to as the "[[Davidic line|House of David]]."&lt;ref&gt;Joffe p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the destruction of the Israelite kingdoms of [[kingdom of Samaria|Samaria]] and [[kingdom of Judah|Judah]] in 720  and 586 BCE respectively,&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein &amp; Silberman 2001, [[The Bible Unearthed]] p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Grabbe2004"&gt;{{cite book |last= Grabbe |first= Lester L. |authorlink= Lester L.

When the Jews returned from the [[Babylonian captivity]], the [[Hasmonean kingdom]] was established{{dubious|Almost four centuries passed between the two events!|date=June 2018}} in present-day [[Israel]], consisting of three regions which were Judea, Samaria, and the Galilee. In the pre-exilic [[First Temple Period]] the political power of [[Judea]] was concentrated within the [[tribe of Judah]], [[Samaria]] was dominated by the [[tribe of Ephraim]] and the [[House of Joseph]], while the [[Galilee]] was associated with the [[tribe of Naphtali]], the most eminent tribe of northern Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Sefer Devariam Pereq לד, ב; Deuteronomy 34, 2, Sefer Yehoshua Pereq כ, ז; Joshua 20, 7, Sefer Yehoshua Pereq כא, לב; Joshua 21, 32, Sefer Melakhim Beth Pereq טו, כט; Second Kings 15, 29, Sefer Devrei Ha Yamim Aleph Pereq ו, סא; First Chronicles 6, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Kingdom of Samaria, the Galilee was populated by northern tribes of Israel, but following the Babylonian exile the region became Jewish. During the [[Second Temple period]] relations between the Jews and Samaritans remained tense. In 120 BCE the Hasmonean king [[John Hyrcanus|Yohanan Hyrcanos I]] destroyed the Samaritan temple on [[Mount Gerizim]], due to the resentment between the two groups over a disagreement of whether [[Mount Moriah]] in [[Jerusalem]] or [[Mount Gerizim]] in [[Shechem]] was the actual site of the [[Aqedah]], and the chosen place for the [[Mishkan|Holy Temple]], a source of contention that had been growing since the two houses of the former [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]] first split asunder in 930 BCE and which had finally exploded into warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/arc/neapolis/samaritantemple.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 12, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812210127/http://www.usc.edu/dept/LAS/arc/neapolis/samaritantemple.htm |archive-date=August 12, 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.antiquities.org.il/article_Item_eng.asp?sec_id=36&amp;subj_id=286 |publisher= Israel Antiquities Authority |title=The Gathering at the President's House |accessdate= March 27, 2015 |author=Y.

[[File:Stiftshuette Modell Timnapark.jpg|thumb|Model of the [[Mishkan]] constructed under the auspices of [[Moses]], in [[Timna Park]], [[Israel]]|upright=1.15]]
The Israelite story begins with some of the [[culture hero]]es of the Jewish people, the [[Patriarch (Bible)|Patriarchs]]. The [[Torah]] traces the Israelites to the patriarch [[Jacob]], grandson of Abraham, who was renamed Israel after a mysterious incident in which he wrestles all night with God or an angel. Jacob's twelve sons (in order of birth), [[Reuben (Bible)|Reuben]], [[Simeon (Hebrew Bible)|Simeon]], [[Levi]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]], [[Dan (Bible)|Dan]], [[Naphtali]], [[Gad (son of Jacob)|Gad]], [[Asher]], [[Issachar]], [[Zebulun]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] and [[Benjamin]], become the ancestors of twelve tribes, with the exception of Joseph, whose two sons [[Manasseh (tribal patriarch)|Mannasseh]] and [[Ephraim]], who were adopted by Jacob, become tribal [[eponym]]s ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|48|HE}}).&lt;ref name="wylen"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SHgiy-k_wsUC&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Jews in the time of Jesus: an introduction'' p. 18] Stephen M. Wylen, Paulist Press, 1996, 215 pages, pp. 18–20&lt;/ref&gt;

The mothers of Jacob's sons are:
* [[Leah]]: Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Zebulun
* [[Rachel]]: Joseph (Ephraim and Menasseh), Benjamin
* [[Bilhah]] (Rachel's maid): Dan, Naphtali
* [[Zilpah]] (Leah's maid): Gad, Asher ({{Bibleverse||Genesis|35:22–26|HE}})&lt;ref name="wylen"/&gt;

Jacob and his sons are forced by famine to go down into [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], although Joseph was already there, as he had been sold into slavery while young. When they arrive they and their families are 70 in number, but within four generations they have increased to 600,000 men of fighting age, and the Pharaoh of Egypt, alarmed, first enslaves them and then orders the death of all male Hebrew children. A woman from the tribe of Levi hides her child, places him in a woven basket, and sends him down the [[Nile]] river. He is named Mosheh, or [[Moses]], by the Egyptians who find him. Being a Hebrew baby, they award a Hebrew woman the task of raising him, the mother of Moses volunteers, and the child and his mother are reunited.&lt;ref&gt;Bereshith, Genesis&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 1 and 2&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of forty Moses kills an Egyptian, after he sees him beating a Hebrew to death, and escapes as a fugitive into the Sinai desert, where he is taken in by the Midianites and marries [[Zipporah]], the daughter of the Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]]. When he is eighty years old, Moses is tending a herd of sheep in solitude on [[Mount Sinai]] when he sees a desert shrub that is burning but is [[burning bush|not consumed]]. The [[God in Judaism|God of Israel]] calls to Moses from the fire and reveals his name, Yahweh (from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root word 'HWH' meaning to exist), and tells Moses that he is being sent to Pharaoh to bring the people of Israel out of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 3 and 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahweh tells Moses that if Pharaoh refuses to let the [[Hebrews]] go to say to Pharaoh "Thus says Yahweh: Israel is my son, my first-born and I have said to you: Let my son go, that he may serve me, and you have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay your son, your first-born". Moses returns to Egypt and tells Pharaoh that he must let the Hebrew slaves go free. Pharaoh refuses and Yahweh strikes the Egyptians with a series of horrific [[Ten plagues of Egypt|plagues, wonders, and catastrophes]], after which Pharaoh relents and banishes the Hebrews from Egypt. Moses [[The Exodus|leads the Israelites out of bondage]]&lt;ref name="andré dollinger"&gt;[http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/texts/ipuwer.htm English translation of the papyrus. A translation also in R. B. Parkinson, ''The Tale of Sinuhe and Other Ancient Egyptian Poems''. Oxford World's Classics, 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; toward the [[Red Sea]], but Pharaoh changes his mind and arises to massacre the fleeing Hebrews. Pharaoh finds them by the sea shore and attempts to drive them into the ocean with his chariots and drown them.&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 5 through 15&lt;/ref&gt;

Yahweh [[Crossing the Red Sea|causes the Red Sea to part]] and the Hebrews pass through on dry land into the Sinai. After the Israelites escape from the midst of the sea, Yahweh causes the ocean to close back in on the pursuing Egyptian army, drowning them to death. In the [[Sinai Desert|desert]] Yahweh feeds them with [[manna]] that accumulates on the ground with the morning dew. They are led by a [[Pillar of Cloud|column of cloud]], which ignites at night and becomes a [[Pillar of Fire (theophany)|pillar of fire]] to illuminate the way, southward through the desert until they come to Mount Sinai. The twelve tribes of Israel encamp around the mountain, and on the third day Mount Sinai begins to smolder, then catches fire, and Yahweh speaks the [[Ten Commandments]] from the midst of the fire to all the Israelites, from the top of the mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 15, 19, and 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses ascends [[biblical Mount Sinai]] and fasts for forty days while he writes down the [[Torah]] as Yahweh dictates, beginning with [[Genesis creation narrative|Bereshith]] and the creation of the universe and earth.&lt;ref&gt;Bereshith; Genesis 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hidden Face of God: Science Reveals the Ultimate Truth by [[Gerald Schroeder|Gerald L. Schroeder]] PhD (May 9, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; He is shown the design of the [[Mishkan]] and the [[Ark of the Covenant]], which [[Bezalel]] is given the task of building. Moses descends from the mountain forty days later with the [[Sefer Torah]] he wrote, and with two rectangular [[lapis lazuli]]&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 24&lt;/ref&gt; tablets, into which Yahweh had carved the Ten Commandments in [[Paleo-Hebrew alphabet|Paleo–Hebrew]]. In his absence, [[Aaron]] has constructed an image of Yahweh,&lt;ref&gt;Tehillim; Psalms 106, 19–20&lt;/ref&gt; depicting him as a young [[Golden Calf]], and has presented it to the Israelites, declaring "Behold O Israel, this is your god who brought you out of the land of Egypt". Moses smashes the two tablets and grinds the golden calf into dust, then throws the dust into a stream of water flowing out of Mount Sinai, and forces the Israelites to drink from it.&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 21 through 32&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:12 Tribes of Israel Map.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Map of the twelve tribes of Israel (before the move of Dan to the north), based on the [[Book of Joshua#Division of the land .28chapters 13.E2.80.9321.29|Book of Joshua]]]]
Moses ascends Mount Sinai for a second time and Yahweh [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy|passes before]] him and says: 'Yahweh, Yahweh, a god of compassion, and showing favor, slow to anger, and great in kindness and in truth, who shows kindness to the thousandth generation, forgiving wrongdoing and injustice and wickedness, but will by no means clear the guilty, causing the consequences of the parent's wrongdoing to befall their children, and their children's children, to the third and fourth generation'&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus, 34, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; Moses then fasts for another forty days while Yahweh carves the Ten Commandments into a second set of stone tablets. After the tablets are completed, light emanates from the face of Moses for the rest of his life, causing him to wear a veil so he does not frighten people.&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Moses descends Mount Sinai and the Israelites agree to be the [[Jews as a chosen people|chosen people of Yahweh]] and [[Shomer Shabbat|follow all the laws of the Torah]]. Moses prophesies if they forsake the Torah, Yahweh will [[Babylonian exile|exile]] them for the total number of years they did not observe the [[shmita]].&lt;ref&gt;Wayiqra; Leviticus 26&lt;/ref&gt; Bezael constructs the Ark of the Covenant and the Mishkan, where the presence of Yahweh dwells on earth in the [[Holy of Holies]], above the Ark of the Covenant, which houses the Ten Commandments. Moses sends spies to scout out the [[Land of Canaan]], and the Israelites are commanded to go up and conquer the land, but they refuse, due to their fear of warfare and violence. In response, Yahweh condemns the entire generation, including Moses, who is condemned for [[Meribah|striking the rock]] at Meribah, to exile and death in the Sinai desert.&lt;ref&gt;Shemoth; Exodus 35 through 40, Wayiqra; Leviticus, Bamidhbar; Numbers, Devariam; Deuteronomy&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Moses dies he gives a speech to the Israelites where he paraphrases [[Deuteronomy|a summary]] of the [[mizwa|mizwoth]] given to them by Yahweh, and recites a prophetic song called the [[Ha'azinu]]. Moses prophesies that if the Israelites disobey the Torah, Yahweh will cause a global [[Bar Kochba Revolt#Immediate consequences and exile|exile]] in addition to the minor one prophesied earlier at Mount Sinai, but at the end of days Yahweh will [[Gathering of Israel|gather them back to Israel from among the nations]] when they turn back to the Torah with zeal.&lt;ref&gt;Devariam; Deuteronomy 28 and 29 and 30&lt;/ref&gt; The events of the Israelite exodus and their sojourn in the Sinai are memorialized in the Jewish and Samaritan festivals of [[Passover]] and [[Sukkoth]], and the giving of the Torah in the Jewish celebration of [[Shavuoth]].&lt;ref name="wylen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Devariam; Deuteronomy&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty years after [[the Exodus]], following the death of the generation of Moses, a new generation, led by [[Joshua]], enters Canaan and takes possession of the land in accordance with the promise made to Abraham by Yahweh. Land is allocated to the tribes by [[Land Lottery|lottery]]. Eventually the Israelites ask for a king, and Yahweh gives them [[Saul]]. [[David]], the youngest (divinely favored) son of [[Jesse]] of [[Bethlehem]] would succeed [[Saul]]. Under David the Israelites establish the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united monarchy]], and under David's son [[Solomon]] they construct the [[Holy Temple in Jerusalem]], using the 400-year-old materials of the Mishkan, where Yahweh continues to tabernacle himself among them. On the death of Solomon and reign of his son, [[Rehoboam]], the kingdom is divided in two.&lt;ref&gt;Yehoshua; Joshua, Shoftim; Judges, Shmuel; Samuel, Melakhim; Kings&lt;/ref&gt;

The kings of the northern [[Kingdom of Samaria]] are uniformly bad, permitting the worship of other gods and failing to enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, and so Yahweh eventually allows them to be conquered and dispersed among the peoples of the earth; and strangers rule over their remnant in the northern land. In [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]] some kings are good and enforce the worship of Yahweh alone, but many are bad and permit other gods, even in the Holy Temple itself, and at length Yahweh allows Judah to fall to her enemies, the people taken into captivity in [[Babylon]], the land left empty and desolate, and the Holy Temple itself destroyed.&lt;ref name="wylen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melakhim; Kings, Divrei HaYamim; Chronicles&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet despite these events Yahweh does not forget his people, but sends [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus, king of Persia]] to deliver them from bondage. The Israelites are allowed to return to Judah and Benjamin, the Holy Temple is rebuilt, the priestly orders restored, and the service of sacrifice resumed. Through the offices of the sage [[Ezra]], Israel is constituted as a holy nation, bound by the Torah and holding itself apart from all other peoples.&lt;ref name="wylen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Jindai moji''''' or '''''Kamiyo moji''''' (Japanese: {{lang|ja|神代文字}} “characters of [[the Age of the Gods]]”) are characters said to have been used in ancient Japan. Some  have claimed since the mid-[[Edo period]] that such ancient characters, for example such as [[Chikushi characters]] and [[Hokkaido characters]], have been found in archeological remains, in [[Kofun]] and on mountains, but all ''jindai moji'' are generally considered to be forgeries.&lt;ref name=tsukishima /&gt; No earthenware with such characters has ever been found.

[[File:Hokkaido itaimoji.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Hokkaido characters investigated by [[Enomoto Takeaki]] and [[John Milne]]{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}]]

== History ==
The concept of ''jindai moji'' was first addressed at the end of the [[Kamakura period]]. [[Urabe no Kanekata]] ([[:ja:卜部兼方|卜部兼方]]) mentioned in [[Shaku Nihongi]] that his father. Urabe no Kanefumi, argued that the ancient Japanese could not have performed [[oracle bone|bone]]-style fortunetelling with turtleshells (亀卜, ''Kameura'', "turtle fortunetelling"), as described in the [[Nihon Shoki]], without having a writing system.

Some examples of ''jindai moji'' appeared during the [[Edo period]], each set being named after its supposed source. Even then, the authenticity of ''jindai moji'' was supported by scholars such as [[Tsurumine Shigenobu]] ([[:ja:鶴峯戊申|鶴峯戊申]]), and at least one scholar, [[Hirata Atsutane]], changed his opinion from negative to positive. Other scholars, such as [[Kaibara Ekken]], [[Dazai Shundai]] ([[:ja:太宰春台|太宰春台]]), [[Kamo no Mabuchi]], [[Motoori Norinaga]] and [[Tō Teikan]] ([[:ja:藤貞幹|藤貞幹]]), rejected both the concepts and the claimed examples. The most famous article denying the existence of ''jindai moji'' was ''Jindaiji ben'' (神代字弁), attached to ''Kana no motosue'' (仮字本末) by [[Ban Nobutomo]] ([[:ja:伴信友|伴信友]]). The skepticism about ''jindai moji'' that developed in the Edo period&lt;ref name=tsukishima /&gt; has been the prevailing attitude among scholars ever since.&lt;ref name=Kofu1994&gt;{{cite book|last=Kawaguchi(川口）|first=Kōfū（高風）|title=Debate over Jindai moji with Tainin-Risshi [諦忍律師の神代文字論をめぐる論争]|year=1994|publisher=Aichi Gakuin University Journal volume41-3|location=JP|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jindaimoji"&gt;Naozumi Ochiai ''Thoughts on Japanese Ancient Characters [日本古代文字考]'' Komakisha 1888; republished by Yahata Shoten 1982 &lt;!--page?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, a religious sect, [[Amatsukyō]], was charged with [[Lese-majesty]] by the [[Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu|special higher police]]. Amatsukyō had used documents that were partly written in what its members said were ''jindai moji''. Experts in [[linguistics]] and other scholars gave evidence in court that the documents were  forgeries. However, the documents and other artifacts of this sect were destroyed in the American bombardment of Tokyo.

== Reasons for skepticism ==
# The [[Kogo Shūi]], written in 808, clearly states that the Japanese had no writing system, and thus no characters, before [[Kanji]] were imported, and nobody before Urabe no Kanekata (mentioned above) made any reference to such "ancient characters."&lt;ref name=tsukishima /&gt;
# The examples of ''jindai moji'' that have been put forward over the years have all clearly been based on Modern Japanese, which had five vowels, and not [[Old Japanese]], which until the [[Heian period]] had eight vowels.
# [[Shinkichi Hashimoto]] studied documents written in [[Man'yōgana]] during the [[Nara period]] and found the [[Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai]], proving that there were  88 sounds in the ancient language, but ''jindai moji'' have only 50 or fewer, matching the [[Gojūon]] and [[Iroha]] of the [[Heian period]].&lt;ref name=tsukishima&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:国語学 |title=Kokugo-gaku|year=1964|publisher=Tokyo University Publishing|location=Japan|author=Tsukishima, Hiroshi|pages=47–48|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# If ''jindai moji'' had been in use before the Japanese became aware of [[Kanji]], it is impossible to explain why they would have swiftly and totally abandoned such characters in favour of the much more complex new characters derived from China, or why they then went on to develop [[Man'yōgana]], [[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]], all of which are based on Kanji and show no evidence of any connection with ''jindai moji''.&lt;ref name=tsukishima /&gt;

== Claims in favor of ''jindai moji'' ==
# Some recent writers have interpreted the following passage in the [[Shaku Nihongi]] to support their view that ''jindai moji'' were in use in ancient Japan: "There are six or seven documents written in characters of [[Hi Province]](肥人の字、Ahiru characters) in the [[Ministry of the Treasury]]."
# It was reported in the late 19th century that ancient characters had been found in [[Ryukyu]]&lt;ref&gt;神谷由道（1886）『東京人類学会報告』第9号 Yoshimichi Kamiya （1886） Anthropological Science （Japanese Series） No. 9&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Ezo]],&lt;ref&gt;坪井正五郎（1887）『東京人類学会雑誌』第18号 Shogoro Tsuboi(1887) Anthropological Science （Japanese Series） No. 18&lt;/ref&gt; and these claims received some support from respectable mainstream scholars, at least at the time.

'''KV55''' is a tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in [[Egypt]]. It was discovered by [[Edward R. Ayrton]] in 1907 while he was working in the Valley for [[Theodore M. Davis]]. It has long been speculated, as well as much-disputed, that the body found in this tomb was that of the famous Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], who moved the capital to Akhetaten (modern day [[Amarna]]). The results of genetic and other scientific tests published in February 2010 have confirmed that the person buried there was both the son of [[Amenhotep III]] as well as the father of [[Tutankhamun]]. Furthermore, the study established that the age of this person at the time of his death was consistent with that of Akhenaten's, thereby making it almost certain that it is Akhenaten's body.&lt;ref name="HawassZahi"&gt;Hawass, Zahi et al. "Ancestry and Pathology in King Tutankhamun's Family" &lt;cite&gt;The Journal of the American Medical Association (2010) &lt;/cite&gt; p.644&lt;/ref&gt; However, a growing body of work soon began to appear to dispute the assessment of the age of the mummy and the identification of KV55 as Akhenaten.&lt;ref name=STROUHAL&gt;Strouhal, E. "Biological age of skeletonized mummy from Tomb KV 55 at Thebes" in ''Anthropologie: International Journal of the Science of Man'' Vol 48 Issue 2 (2010), pp 97–112.  Dr. Strouhal examined KV55 in 1998, but the results were apparently delayed and perhaps eclipsed by Filer's examination in 2000.  Strouhal's findings were published in 2010 to dispute the Hawass et al conclusions.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kv64.info/2010/03/dna-shows-that-kv55-mummy-probably-not.html |title=News from the Valley of the Kings: DNA Shows that KV55 Mummy Probably Not Akhenaten |publisher=Kv64.info |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nature'' 472, 404–406 (2011); Published online 27 April 2011;

Both the tomb's history and the identification of its single occupant have been problematic. It is assumed to be a royal cache and reburial dating from the late [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th Dynasty]], prepared after the abandonment of [[Amarna]] and the dismantling of the royal necropolis there.  On the basis of the recovered artifacts, it is also suggested that the burial once contained more than a single occupant, either interred on one occasion or over a period of time. Queen [[Tiye]] is most often named in this context.

It is also clear that the tomb was re-entered at a later time, almost certainly during the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt|20th Dynasty]]. At this time, any additional, hypothetical occupants of the tomb would have been removed and (possibly) relocated to [[KV35]], while the remaining mummy and some of the other artefacts were desecrated and abandoned.

The tomb is often referred to as the ''Amarna cache'', given the mixed nature of its contents.

==Discovery and excavations==
The entrance to KV55 was uncovered by Ayrton on 6 January 1907. Its discovery was brought to Davis's attention on the following day. The tomb was first entered on 9 January by Ayrton, Davis, [[Joseph Lindon Smith]], and (as the representative of the antiquities service) [[Arthur Weigall]]. On the 11th, the finds were photographed.&lt;ref name="davis p.v"&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;,  (KMT Communications. 1990), p.v&lt;/ref&gt; Ayrton then began clearance of the tomb. On 25 January 1907, the coffin and mummy were investigated in situ.&lt;ref name="davis p.vii"&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;,  (KMT Communications. 1990), p.vii.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a letter from Davis to [[Gaston Maspero]], some of the objects found in KV55 were still in place in January 1908, and their study and attempts at conservation were still ongoing at this later date.&lt;ref name="davis p.vii" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt;, (Keegan Paul, 1990), p
. 335-336&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, while excavating south of the tomb, [[Howard Carter]] discovered several items that seem to have originated in KV55. These include a jasper burnisher and some fragments of copper rosettes from a funerary pall.&lt;ref name="davis p.ix"&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;,  (KMT Communications. 1990), p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

After its excavation, the tomb's entrance was fitted with a steel door, which however was later removed and replaced by stone blocking. By 1944, this blocking had collapsed and filled the tomb's entrance with debris. In 1993, the tomb was cleared again by [[Lyla Pinch Brock]]. In 1996, she undertook conservation work on the stairs and the plastering inside the burial chamber through a grant from the American Research Centre in Egypt.&lt;ref name="tomb869"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/sites/browse_tomb_869.html |title=KV 55 Tiye(?) or Akhenaten(?) |publisher=The Theban Mapping Project |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===KVC===
Three days before the discovery of KV55, Ayrton uncovered a recess in the rock (now designated as KVC) located immediately above the entrance to KV55 and containing jars of 20th dynasty type.&lt;ref name="davis90pv"&gt;Davis (1990), p.v.&lt;/ref&gt; This recess may have been an unfinished tomb commencement, and its content may be analogous to the embalming cache found in [[KV54]], but because the find was never properly published, the precise nature of its contents, the date of the jars, and its relation (if any) to KV55 are now unclear.&lt;ref name="davis90pv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reeves90p172"&gt;Reeves (1990), p.172&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell90p137"&gt;Bell (1990) p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tomb==

===Location and general appearance===
[[Image:KV55.svg|thumb|300px|Tomb layout of KV55&lt;br /&gt;A - Entrance&lt;br /&gt;B - Corridor&lt;br /&gt;J - Burial chamber&lt;br /&gt;Ja - (unfinished) Ante-chamber]]
KV55 is a relatively small, undecorated, single-chamber  tomb, its total length measuring only 27.61 meters.&lt;ref name="tomb869"/&gt; It is located in the central area of the Valley, immediately adjacent to and below [[KV 6]] ([[Ramesses IX]]) and across the valley floor from [[KV7]] ([[Ramesses II]]) and the near-contemporary tomb [[KV62]] ([[Tutankhamun]]). Oriented almost due east, its entranceway consists of a set of stairs cut into the Valley's bedrock which lead to a gently sloping corridor and then to the tomb's single chamber.

The tomb appears to be unfinished: in the south wall of the burial chamber is a small niche, the commencement of an unfinished  antechamber, while red masonry marks within the burial chamber indicate plans for yet another room. When finished these would have made the tomb's layout roughly similar to that of Tutankhamun's. Such a plan seems to indicate that KV55, like KV62, was initially intended as a private burial site and only later taken over for a royal interment.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, N., Wilkinson, R.H., &lt;cite&gt;''The Complete Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt;, (Thames &amp; Hudson. 1997), p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entranceway===
The tomb is accessed by a flight of 20 steps, cut into the bedrock and covered by an overhanging rock. An [[ostracon]] found by Pinch Brock in 1993 has been interpreted as a plan of the tomb, and possibly indicates a  widening of the entrance after its initial cutting. This possibility is also suggested by mason's marks found on the walls by the tomb's entrance. It appears that the stairwell has been enlarged, its ceiling raised, and the number of steps increased.&lt;ref name="tomb869"/&gt;

When the tomb was discovered in 1907, the stairwell was covered with debris, probably originating from the cutting of KV 6 directly above.&lt;ref name="tomb869"/&gt; The upper layer of this filling consisted of chips cemented together by water; underneath, the chips were dry and clean.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doorway and blocking===
When it was discovered, the tomb's outer door was blocked by two consecutive walls. The primary blocking consisted of a wall of cemented limestone blocks, plastered and stamped with the seal of the Royal Necropolis (with the jackal and nine captives motif).&lt;ref name="reeves p.42"&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Weigall later stated that a fragment of Tutankhamun's seal had been recovered from this original blocking.&lt;ref&gt;Weigall, A.E.P.B., &lt;cite&gt;The Treasury of Ancient Egypt&lt;/cite&gt; (Rand McNally and Company, 1912) p.208&lt;/ref&gt; However, his statement is not corroborated by any of the other reports dating from the initial discovery, leaving Weigall's claim open to question.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p.vi.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wall had been partially pulled down in antiquity, and the tomb was closed again by a second wall made of loose limestone fragments, erected in front of the remains of the first wall. Because Weigall described these consecutive blockings in ambiguous terms, it is unclear whether the secondary wall was found intact or had already been partially dismantled, like the primary wall.&lt;ref name="davis p.v" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bell p.133"&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corridor===
The sloping corridor beyond the entrance was partially filled with rubble. Since the secondary wall was built on top of material originating from this rubble, the fill seems to date from the time of the original interment. By 1907 this rubble had spread down into the burial chamber.&lt;ref name="reeves p.42" /&gt; Stains on the ceiling and walls of the corridor indicate that water had infiltrated the tomb in the past.&lt;ref name="tomb869"/&gt;

On top of the rubble fill were found a panel and door of a large gilded shrine, although the exact position of these items is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt;, (Keegan Paul, 1990), p. 45, fig 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 110, p. 116 and fig. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Additional pieces of the same shrine were recovered from the burial chamber.

===Burial chamber and niche===
The walls of the burial chamber were plastered but otherwise undecorated. This plastering seems to have been done some years after the cutting of the tomb, and repairs are evident.&lt;ref name="tomb869"/&gt; Rubble fill from the corridor had spread down into the chamber, partially covering its floor with debris. Elsewhere in the burial chamber, the floor and numerous objects were covered with fragments of plaster fallen from the walls and stones fallen from the ceiling.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Items found in the burial chamber can be grouped into several categories:&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p.46-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 110-119&lt;/ref&gt;
*Parts of a dismantled, gilded shrine: Related to the panel and door found in the corridor. A door was found lying on the rubble inflow near the entrance to the chamber; large panels were lying on the floor or stacked against the eastern wall; and smaller elements (such as doorjambs, a lintel, and possibly parts of the cornice) were lying on the floor.
*Coffin, mummy, and related items: Lying against the southern wall and resting on the decayed remains of a lion-headed bier was a badly damaged coffin. Its lid was ajar, and the coffin box had rotted. The mummy contained in this coffin was badly preserved but its linen wrappings appear to have been intact. The damaged skull had been separated from the body and was found with a vulture [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] wrapped around it. The left arm of the body was crossed over the chest, the right arm extended. In the niche above this coffin was found a set of four canopic jars. Also related to this group of items were four "magical bricks."
*Remains of boxes and their contents: At least two badly preserved boxes were found in the south-eastern corner of the room, their contents spread on the floor. These included faience objects and appear to have been related to the "Opening of the Mouth" ceremony.
*Seal impressions: Several small seal impressions were found underneath the panels of the gilded shrine. These carry Tutankhamun's prenomen and are identical to seal type N found in Tutankhamun's own tomb.
*Other items: Their exact location in the chamber is not always clear. Included are a vase stand, fragment of furniture, a silver head of a goose, pall-discs of gilded copper, and a statue plinth.

Some wooden objects in the burial chamber seem to have suffered water damage, most notably the coffin, bier, and boxes; however, the elements of the gilded shrine appear to have been reasonably solid.&lt;ref name="bell p.132"&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p.132&lt;/ref&gt; Moisture is also the likely cause of the discoloration visible on some of the faience objects, although other, similar objects appear unaffected.&lt;ref name="bell p.132" /&gt;

==Interpretation==
The problems surrounding the interpretation of KV55 are due in large part to the shortcomings of Davis's original publication of the excavation. Its mix of fact, assumption, error, and omission has obscured a full understanding of the deposit ever since.&lt;ref name="davis p.iv"&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt; (KMT Communications. 1990), p. iv&lt;/ref&gt; The blame for these shortcomings usually falls on Davis (as editor of the publication) and Ayrton (as supervising archaeologist).&lt;ref name="davis p.iv" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;
Recent careful re-examinations&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''The Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 42-49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the original publication, of eyewitness reports, and of the photographs taken before the tomb was cleared have brought some clarity to the situation.

Although the tomb was clearly disturbed in antiquity (see below), and although its contents have been described as disorded and chaotic,&lt;ref name="reeves p.43"&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''The Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Martha Bell argued that this disarray was more apparent than real. Her reconstruction of the layout of the tomb indicates an orderly and deliberate arrangement of artefacts, and she suggests that the impression of chaos might be due to the collapse of wooden objects caused by falling plaster and stone.&lt;ref name="Bell" /&gt; The "cemented" chips and stains in the corridor indicate that water entered the tomb along the corridor ceiling, but the amount of water might not have been great, and most damage could have been caused by increased humidity rather than direct contact with water. Bell also suggested that the moisture under the mummy might have resulted from rainfall shortly after the tomb's opening in 1907. Other damage to wooden objects might result from an insect attack.&lt;ref name="bell p.132" /&gt;

===The shrine and Tiye's burial===
A recent reconstruction of the shrine,&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 127 and following&lt;/ref&gt; based on photographic evidence, drawings, eyewitness descriptions, and two surviving planks on display in Cairo, indicate that it resembled Tutankhamun's second and third shrines in general appearance and size. The presence of copper rosettes indicate that a funeral pall was draped on a frame associated with the shrine, also comparable to Tutankhamun's shrines.&lt;ref name="bell p.129"&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; However, the decoration and inscriptions on the shrine are markedly different from those of Tutankhamun: the decoration was dominated by large offering scenes rather than a multitude of smaller mythological scenes; the text was far more brief, and seems primarily concerned with titles, names, and the shrine's dedication, rather than with excerpts from funerary books; and the interior of the shrine was uninscribed and undecorated.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 120, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The text on the shrine states that it was made by Akhenaten for his mother Tiye. With one exception, the names of Akhenaten were erased and in some places were replaced by those of [[Amenhotep III]] in ink.&lt;ref name="bell p.129" /&gt; The text also refers to the "House of the Aten in Akhetaten," perhaps indicating that the shrine was made and originally used in Amarna.&lt;ref name="bell p.132" /&gt; The decoration, which appears to have been very similar on all sides of the shrine, features Akhenaten and Tiye making offerings to the Aten, with a focus on the king rather than his mother. As with his names, Akhenaten's figure was erased from the scenes, with one exception.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 120-129&lt;/ref&gt;

The orderly arrangement of the shrine parts inside the tomb seems to indicate that it once stood up, fully assembled, with its doors facing south, and that it was later dismantled inside the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that only a single shrine was used in KV55, rather than a suite of four nested shrines as in the tomb of Tutankhamun.&lt;ref name="bell p.129" /&gt;

The presence of a shrine dedicated to Tiye is usually seen as evidence that Tiye's mummy once reposed inside the shrine in KV55. Other objects inscribed with her name (such as the piece of furniture) and with those of [[Amenhotep III]] are also seen as belonging to her funerary equipment. The seal impressions found near the east wall might indicate further items that were removed together with the queen's mummy at some later point.&lt;ref name="bell p.135"&gt;Bell, M.R., &lt;cite&gt;"An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990)&lt;/cite&gt; p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coffin, canopic jars and magical bricks===
[[File:KV55 sarcophagus (Cairo Museum).jpg|thumb|upright|The desecrated royal coffin found in Tomb KV55]]
When KV55 was initially opened, Theodore Davis believed that he had found the tomb of Queen [[Tiye]]. However, it was quickly recognized that the human remains interred there were male. [[Georges Émile Jules Daressy|Georges Daressy]] further deduced that the gilded coffin found in the tomb was originally made for a woman and only later adapted to accommodate a king, through alterations to its inscriptions and the addition of a false beard, a [[uraeus]], and the royal scepters ([[Shepherd|crook]] and [[flail]]).&lt;ref&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. viii&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of the coffin's original owner has been a matter of much discussion over the years, with Tiye, [[Nefertiti]], [[Meketaten]], and [[Meritaten]] all proposed as candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. viii-x&lt;/ref&gt; It is now widely accepted that the coffin was originally intended for [[Akhenaten]]'s secondary wife [[Kiya]].&lt;ref name="davis p.xii"&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; It is also recognized that the four canopic jars discovered near the coffin belonged to Kiya, and that the female heads on the jars' stoppers portray her. Like the coffin, the canopic jars were altered for the burial of a king through the erasure of Kiya's titulary and the addition of a royal uraeus to each portrait head.&lt;ref name="davis p.xii" /&gt;

All personal names inscribed on the coffin and the canopic jars were excised in antiquity, rendering the identity of the human remains inside the coffin a matter of long debate. Over the past century, the chief candidates for this individual have been either Akhenaten himself or [[Smenkhkare]], another male member of the Amarna royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. viii, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, C., &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten, King of Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt; (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabolde, M., [http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/M%20Gabolde.pdf "Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky"], ''Causing His Name to Live: Studies in Egyptian Epigraphy and History in Memory of William J. Murnane'' figs. 2-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that the occupant of the coffin was Akhenaten is provided by the four magical bricks found inside the tomb. Two were inscribed in [[hieratic]], but they are poorly preserved and the name of their owner is lost. The other two, however, are of better quality, with  hieroglyphic inscriptions naming ''the Osiris Neferkheprure Waenre,'' a reference to Akhenaten's nomen.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''The Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990), p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that all four bricks were orientated correctly and that three of them were positioned in close association with the coffin suggests that they were intended as a set and were made for the coffin's final occupant,&lt;ref name="bell p.134"&gt;Bell, M.R., "An Armchair Excavation of KV 55", ''JARCE 27'' (1990), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; who would therefore be Akhenaten.

===The identification of the mummy===
[[Image:KV55 scull.jpg|thumb|Profile view of the skull recovered from KV55]]
The mummy found in the tomb was however at first identified as belonging to a woman by two visiting physicians who examined the remains in situ. This led Davis to conclude he had found the mummy of queen Tiye and he therefore published his account of the discovery as ''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''.&lt;ref name="davis p.vii" /&gt; As possible reasons for this initial identification the (typical female) position of the mummy's arms,&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''The Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p.44-49&lt;/ref&gt; post-mortem damage to the pelvic bones&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, C., &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten, King of Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt; (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; and the absence of male genitalia&lt;ref name="bell p.133" /&gt; have been suggested. But when anatomist [[Grafton Elliot Smith]] examined the skull and bones in Cairo a few months later he concluded that they were those of a young male, with wide hips, a pendent chin and distorted cranium brought on by chronic [[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name="davis p.vii" /&gt; The age of death he estimated as being around 25 years&lt;ref name="davis p.vii" /&gt; although he later suggested the possibility that the body had suffered from [[Frölich's syndrome]] which delayed normal skeletal maturation.&lt;ref name="davis p.ix"/&gt; These results were seen to support the initial claims by Weigall, Maspero and Smith, based on other evidence found in the tomb (see above) that the body was that of Akhenaten.&lt;ref name="davis p.ix" /&gt;

Later re-examinations of the remains confirmed Smith's original identification of the mummy as belonging to a young male (although with feminine trends)&lt;ref name="aldred p.201"&gt;Aldred, C., &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten, King of Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt; (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; but pushed the estimated age of death back to around 20 years.&lt;ref name="aldred p.201-202"&gt;Aldred, C., &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten, King of Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt; (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 201-202&lt;/ref&gt; These re-examinations also indicated that the body showed no signs of  delayed maturation&lt;ref name="davis p.xi"&gt;Davis, T.M., &lt;cite&gt;''The Tomb of Queen Tiyi''&lt;/cite&gt;, (KMT Communications, 1990) p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; and that, while the skull was of unusual shape, it certainly wasn't abnormal,&lt;ref name="aldred p.201" /&gt; and showed no indication of hydrocephalus.&lt;ref name="davis p.ix"/&gt; Reconstruction of the facial features of the skull also indicated that there was no resemblance with Akhenaten's representation on his monuments.&lt;ref name="aldred p.201" /&gt;&lt;ref name="davis p.xi" /&gt; It must be remembered though, that Akhenaten's representations are highly stylised. After the discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun a close resemblance was noted between his mummy and the body found in KV55 and later tests showed both shared the same blood-group (A2) and serum antigen (MN), all of which suggests Tutankhamun and the individual found in KV55 were closely related to each other,&lt;ref name="aldred p.201-202" /&gt; either as father and son, or brothers. Based on these results it was concluded that the KV55 body was too young to be Akhenaten and they were seen to support the claim that the mummy was that of Smenkhkare, an idea first proposed by [[Rex Engelbach]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="davis p.ix" /&gt;

Before February 2010, it was pointed out that the reliability of methods to assess the age of death for mummies in general was uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Gabolde, M., [https://web.archive.org/web/20131012051415/http://cassian.memphis.edu/history/murnane/M_Gabolde.pdf ''Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky''] p. 14 and following&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons the correctness of the age estimates was repeatedly called into question.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, C., &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten, King of Egypt''&lt;/cite&gt; (Thames and Hudson, 1988) p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;''The Valley of the Kings''&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell p.135" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabolde, M., [https://web.archive.org/web/20131012051415/http://cassian.memphis.edu/history/murnane/M_Gabolde.pdf ''Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky''] p.16&lt;/ref&gt; This opinion found support in the analysis of the skeletal remains which had indicated an age of death around 35 years (based on dentition) or even later (based on anthropological standards and new X-rays of the long bones).&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N, &lt;cite&gt;''Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet''&lt;/cite&gt; (Thames and Hudson, 2001) p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher, Joann, ''The Search for Nefertiti'' (William Morrow, 2004) p.180&lt;/ref&gt; Some examinations placed the mummy at 20–25 years at death, while others assessed the mummy as 35 years. The archaeological, inscriptional and now genetic evidence indicate that the ancient Egyptians who buried (and later desecrated) the body in KV55 believed this to be Akhenaten's.&lt;ref name="HawassZahi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bell p.135" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gabolde, M., [https://web.archive.org/web/20131012051415/http://cassian.memphis.edu/history/murnane/M_Gabolde.pdf ''Under a Deep Blue Starry Sky'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complicating the identity of the KV55 mummy is the fact that he does not seem to be the father of the female mummy [[KV21]]a. The latter has been identified as the mother of two foetuses found in Tutankhamun's tomb, thus probably making her [[Ankhesenamun]], the daughter of Akhenaten and the only known wife of Tutankhamun.

===Reconstruction===
[[Image:The KV55 Pharaoh's Vulture by Ulises Muñiz.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Egyptian vulture [[pectoral (Ancient Egypt)|pectoral]] found on the head of the mysterious Pharaoh in tomb KV55]]
The deposit as it was found in KV55 presents a mixture of chronological and religious anomalies.&lt;ref name="bell p.134" /&gt; Objects inscribed with Amenhotep III's nomen and prenomen might be contemporary with that king's reign and could be interpreted as possessions of Queen Tiye. Other items inscribed with Tiye's name (such as the shrine and furniture elements) also clearly belonged to her. Akhenaten's presence is indicated by items originally inscribed for him (such as the magical bricks) and items that were adapted for his use (such as the coffin and canopic jars).
It is nevertheless highly unlikely that either of these two burials within KV55 was original. In the case of Tiye, evidence found in tomb [[WV22]] suggests that Amenhotep III prepared her burial in his own tomb. However, the fact that Tiye outlived her husband by possibly as much as twelve years seems to have disrupted such plans.&lt;ref name="reeves p.43" /&gt; From inscriptional evidence on the KV55 shrine on the other hand, it seems likely that Tiye was buried at Amarna by her son Akhenaten. In the case of Akhenaten it seems almost certain that he was originally buried in the tomb he prepared for himself in the Amarna royal wadi.&lt;ref name="reeves p.43" /&gt; Although it is unclear whether or not the original blocking of the tomb was stamped with Tutankhamun's seal, the several small seal impressions carrying his prenomen are most likely related to the reburial(s) in KV55 since he was probably not involved in the original burial preparations of either Tiye (who died several years before Tutankhamun came to the throne) or Akhenaten (who presumably was buried by his co-regent and probable immediate successor Smenkhkare).&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, C.N., &lt;cite&gt;Valley of the Kings&lt;/cite&gt; (Kegan Paul, 1990) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

One scenario, suggested by Nicholas Reeves, is as follows: Akhenaten and his mother, Queen Tiye, were originally entombed at Akhenaten's new capital [[Akhetaten]] (modern Amarna) but their mummies were moved to KV55 following the total abandonment of Akhetaten during the reign of [[Tutankhamun]], who was Akhenaten's son. The door to KV55 was sealed with Tutankhamun's name. There the mummies remained for about 200 years, until the tomb was rediscovered by workmen excavating the tomb of [[Ramesses IX]] nearby. By this time, Akhenaten was reviled as the "heretic king"; consequently, Queen Tiye's sarcophagus was hastily removed from his defiling presence, except for its surrounding gilded wooden shrine which would have had to be dismantled for removal. Akhenaten's likeness was chiseled off of the shrine's carved relief. Moreover, the gold face mask was ripped from Akhenaten's sarcophagus and his identifying cartouche was removed from its hieroglyphic inscription, thus consigning its occupant to oblivion. As a final insult, a large rock was thrown at the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, Nicholas. Akhenaten: Egypt's False Prophet&lt;/cite&gt;. p.83. Thames &amp; Hudson. 2005. {{ISBN|0-500-28552-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a finely made vulture pectoral—a symbol of royalty in Ancient Egypt—was still found placed around this mummy's head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/kv55.htm |title=KV55 |publisher=Touregypt.net |date=1907-01-06 |accessdate=2011-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later use of KV55==
In 1923, [[Harry Burton (Egyptologist)|Harry Burton]] used KV55 as a [[darkroom]] to develop his [[photograph]]s documenting [[Howard Carter (archaeologist)|Howard Carter]]'s excavation of [[KV62|Tutankhamun's tomb]].

'''Kurdistan Islamic Group''' ({{lang-ku|کۆمه‌لی ئیسلامیی کوردستان / عێراق}} ''Komelî Îslamî Kurdistan / 'Êraq''; {{lang-ar|الجماعة الإسلامية الكردستانیة / العراق}} ''al-Jumāʿa al-islāmiya al-Kurdistaniya - al-ʿIrāq'') is a movement in [[Iraq]]i [[Kurdistan]]  established in May 2001 by [[Ali Bapir]], a former leader of the [[Islamic Movement of Kurdistan]].

==Activities==
Regarding their political party position in relation to other political parties, in an interview in January 2003 Ali Bapir stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;
"Our policy is that we enter into fraternity and cooperation with all Islamic groups. We seek such fraternal relations with Islamic parties and organizations, Islamist figures, and groups that follow a [[Salafi]] tradition or a [[Sufi]] or a scientific tradition. In the Komala Islami, we believe that the group must be open-minded and seek fraternity with all those who call or act for Islam. If we see a mistake, we will try to correct it through dialogue and by creating a fraternal atmosphere."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Elections==
In the [[Iraqi legislative election of January 2005]], it decided to run independently from the main [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan|Kurdish coalition]]. It received over 60,000 votes (about 0.7%) and two seats in the transitional [[National Assembly of Iraq]]. After the elections, the party agreed to join the Kurdish alliance's National Assembly caucus....

At the same time, it won 85,237 votes and 6 [[Kurdish National Assembly]] seats in the [[Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election, 2005|Kurdistan election on the same day]]. In the [[Iraqi Kurdistan governorate elections, 2005|Local elections, that day]] they won 18,781 votes (2.9%) and 1 seat (out of 41) in Hawler as well as 53,088 votes (7.3%) and 3 (out of 41) seats in Silemani.

In the [[Iraqi legislative election of December 2005]] they decided to join the [[Democratic Patriotic Alliance of Kurdistan|Kurdish coalition]] and were allocated one seat.

In the [[Iraqi Kurdistan legislative election, 2009]] they formed a coalition with the [[Kurdistan Islamic Union]], [[Kurdistan Socialist Democratic Party]] and the [[Future Party (Iraq)|Future Party]], called the Service and Reform List. The list came third in the election winning 240,842 votes (12.8%) and 13 (out of 111) seats.

In the [[Iraqi legislative election, 2010]] they formed their own independent list. Despite a numerous of campaigns, numbers of their members collapsed and they received only 152,530 votes (1.32%) and 2 seats (one in Hawler and one in Silemani),

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7978">'''Nympholepsy''' was the belief of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] that individuals could be [[Spirit possession|possessed]] by the [[nymph]]s. Individuals who considered themselves nympholepts would display a great religious devotion to the nymphs. An example is Archedemos of [[Santorini|Thera]], who built the sanctuary of the nymphs in the [[Vari Cave]] northeast of [[Attica]], Greece.&lt;ref name=conn /&gt; [[File:Hylas_and_the_Water_Nymphs.jpg|thumb|right|''Hylas and the Water Nymphs'' (1910) by [[Henrietta Rae]]]]

==Etymology==
Nympholepsy, a term first used in 1775 by Richard Chandler in Travels in Greece,&lt;ref name=chan /&gt; is described as “frenzy or rapture [that was] supposed to take hold of a man upon gazing on a nymph”.&lt;ref name=etylepsy /&gt; It originates from the Greek word ''nymphe'', meaning “bride”, “beautiful young woman”, then “semi-divine being in the form of a beautiful maiden”,&lt;ref name=etynym /&gt; and epilepsy, from the Greek word ''epilepsis'', meaning “a seizure”.&lt;ref name=etyepi /&gt; Though the root of nympholepsy implies a fit or seizure, according to [[Socrates]], as presented in the writings of [[Plato]], a person could experience nympholepsy without any “tearing of clothes, the biting of lips, or convulsions, or frenzies”.&lt;ref name=conn /&gt; Plato implies in his writings that nympholepsy showed itself in others by “heightened awareness and eloquence”.&lt;ref name=conn /&gt; Ancient Greece also had the word ''nymphleptos'', meaning “caught by nymphs”.&lt;ref name=etylepsy /&gt;

==Nymphs==
[[File:Amphiglyphon_votif_NAMA_1783_Athens_Greece.jpg|thumb|left|Relief sculpture of nymph Basile and Echelos]]
Nymphs were known as female spirits of the natural world, and were minor goddesses of various aspects in nature – forests, rivers, springs, meadows, mountains and seas.&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt; They were often depicted as beautiful young women with attributes symbolizing whatever natural formation they ruled over.&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt;

Nymphs are most often described as either the daughters of [[Zeus]],&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt; the river [[Oceanus]],&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt; or [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]],&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt; though various other gods and goddesses have been attributed to their parentage over the years. Many gods are also described as having various nymph companions; for example, [[Artemis]] is known for her band of huntress nymphs, [[Poseidon]] is often accompanied by sea nymphs called [[Nereid]]es, and nymph handmaidens were common companions to the goddesses of [[Mount Olympus|Olympos]].&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt; Some elder nymphs, such as those of the [[Oceanid|Okeanides]] and Nereides class, were known as immortal goddesses, but most nymphs had a finite, though very long, lifespan.&lt;ref name=nymph /&gt;

==Archedemos and the Vari Cave==
[[File:Nympholept.jpg|thumb|right|The steps in the Vari Cave, featuring a relief that depicts Archedemos]]
The Vari Cave is also known as the Nympholyptos Cave, and lies northeast of Vari in Attica, Greece. Along with being a shrine to the nymphs, the Vari Cave is also a shrine devoted to the gods [[Pan (god)|Pan]] and [[Apollo]]. It is also known as the Cave of Pan, and is unique for the reliefs cut into the rock by nympholept Archedemos.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;

Archedemos was a native of Thera, an island which is now known as modern-day Santorini &lt;ref name=thera /&gt; and is located 318 kilometers from the Vari Cave.&lt;ref name=theramap /&gt; According to Richard Chandler's writings in his account in Travels in Greece, Archedemos moved from his native town and settled in Attica, Greece, which was 35.5 kilometers from the Cave of Vari &lt;ref name=atticamap /&gt; where he would later create his shrine to the nymphs, Apollo, and Pan.

Though it is a shrine devoted to Apollo and Pan as well, Archedemos created the cave “for the nymphs, by whom he was possessed”.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt; By the writings of Archedemos in the cave, it is presumed that the Vari Cave was furnished with a dwelling and a garden for the nymphs, as well as a well of water.&lt;ref name=chan /&gt;

Richard Chandler, an English antiquary, was the first scientist to report his findings of the Vari Cave in 1765,&lt;ref name=chan /&gt; but the cave was not excavated until 1901 by Charles Heald Weller.&lt;ref name=well /&gt;

==In popular culture==
In modern culture, nympholepsy is also defined as "passion aroused in men by beautiful young girls", and "wild frenzy caused by desire for an unattainable ideal".&lt;ref name=etylepsy /&gt; The most famous example is in Vladimir Nabokov's ''[[Lolita]]'', where the main character Humbert Humbert has an obsession with prepubescent girls he refers to as nymphets and self-describes as a nympholept.&lt;ref name=loli /&gt; The obsession with young girls is explained with the loss of his first love when she was a young age, referring back to the definition of an unattainable ideal.

==Life==
Obodas was the successor of [[Aretas II]], from whom he inherited the war with the [[Hasmonean dynasty|Hasmonean kingdom]]. He defeated them around 93 BCE on the [[Golan Heights]].

Then he ambushed [[Alexander Jannaeus]] near Gadara ([[Umm Qais]]), just east of the [[Sea of Galilee]].

'''Philip Layton Barlow'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Summaries of Doctoral Dissertations | journal=[[Harvard Theological Review]] | volume=82 | issue=4 | date=October 1989 | page=477 | jstor=1510113 | doi=10.1017/s0017816000030686}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born 1950) is a [[Harvard]]-trained scholar who specializes in [[American Religious History]], religious geography, and [[Mormonism]]. In 2007 he became the country’s first full-time professor of Mormon studies at a secular university by being appointed as the [[Leonard J. Arrington]] Chair of Mormon History and Culture at [[Utah State University]].

==Biography==

Barlow was raised in [[Bountiful, Utah]]. In 1975, he graduated with a B.A. in History from [[Weber State College]]. In 1980 and 1988, respectively, he received his Masters in Theological Studies and Doctorate of Theology (Th.D.) from the [[Harvard Divinity School]]. While in the Boston area, Barlow taught at the local LDS [[Institute of Religion]].  He also served as a counselor in a bishopric to [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865561162/As-a-Mormon-leader-Bishop-Mitt-Romney-grew-learned-from-broadened-experiences.html Erik Schulzke "As a Mormon leader, Romney grew, learned from broadened experiences" ''Deseret News'' Aug 24, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of his education, he served in consecutive years as a Mellon Post-doctoral Fellow at the [[University of Rochester]]. Prior to his arrival at [[Utah State University]], Barlow spent 17 years in the Department of Theological Studies at [[Hanover College]] in Indiana.

In 2017 Barlow held the first fellowship at the Neal A. Maxwell Institute for Religious Scholarship at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.hjnews.com/allaccess/usu-mormon-scholar-tapped-for-new-byu-fellowship/article_5607c985-6d9e-591e-929d-dd487df85640.html announcement on Barlow's fellowship appointment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship==

Barlow's research interests have ranged over American religious and historical geography, concepts of “time” in secular and religious society, the problem of suffering and evil, and Mormon theology and practice.  Barlow's first book, ''[[Mormons]] and the [[Bible]]: The Place of the Latter-day Saints in American Religion'' (Oxford, 1991, 1997) analyzed Latter-day Saint uses of the biblical text, including issues revolving around the LDS Church’s official backing of the King James translation.  In 1992, the [[Mormon History Association]] awarded the volume its Best First Book Award.    His second book, the ''New Historical Atlas of Religion in America'' (co-authored with Edwin Scott Gaustad), examined the implications of religion’s connections with “place” and created hundreds of maps portraying the religious composition of the United States over time.  The Association of American Publishers named the work the “Best Single-volume Reference Book in the Humanities” for 2001.

==The Arrington Chair of Mormon History and Culture==

The establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair at Utah State University is one prominent symbol of a new era for the study of the Mormon faith in secular higher education.  It is part of the new Religious Studies Program at the University, the first program in Utah enabling students to major in religion.  Since the establishment in 2007 of the Arrington Chair, [[Richard Bushman]] has been inaugurated as the Howard W. Hunter Chair of Mormon Studies at [[Claremont Graduate University]] of Religion, [[Utah Valley University]] has continued to offer its students a minor in Religious Studies, the [[University of Utah]] has recently followed suit, with both programs showing interest in Mormonism, and the [[University of Wyoming]] is working to gather funds for a professorship in Mormon studies.

==Academic service==

In 2006, Philip Barlow was President of the [[Mormon History Association]], and currently serves on the Boards of Directors for the Society for Mormon Philosophy and Theology and the [[Dialogue Foundation]], on the Steering Committee for the [[American Academy of Religion]]’s new Consultation in Mormon Studies, and as a member of the editorial board of the Intermountain West Journal of Religious Studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7574">In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Pierian Spring''' of [[Kingdom of Macedonia|Macedonia]] was sacred to the [[Muses]]. As the [[metaphor]]ical source of knowledge of [[art]] and [[science]], it was popularized by a couplet in [[Alexander Pope]]'s poem "[[An Essay on Criticism]]" (1711): "A little learning is a dang'rous thing; / Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring."

The Pierian spring is sometimes confused with the [[Castalian Spring]].

==Classical sources==
The [[sacred spring]] was said to be near ancient [[Leivithra]] in [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]], a region of ancient [[Macedon]]ia, also the location of [[Mount Olympus]], and believed to be the home and the seat of worship of [[Orpheus]].&lt;ref&gt;Orpheus and Greek Religion (Mythos Books) by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, 1993, {{ISBN|0-691-02499-5}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; The Muses "were said to have frolicked about the Pierian springs soon after their birth".&lt;ref&gt;Classical Mythology in Literature, Art, and Music (Focus Texts: For Classical Language Study) by Philip Mayerson,2001, page 82: "... the Muses who were said to have frolicked about the Pierian springs soon after their birth. The Castalian spring on Mount Parnassus ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.C. Marchant, Commentary on Thucydides: Book 2,Πιερίας—between Mt. Olympus and the Thermaic Gulf, the original home of the muses and birth-place of Orpheus.&lt;/ref&gt; The spring is believed to be a fountain of knowledge that inspires whoever drinks from it.

The name of the spring comes from the [[Pierides (mythology)|Pierides]], the gaggle of girls (daughters of [[Pierus (king of Macedonia)|King Pierus]]) who sought a contest with the Muses. When they lost, they were turned into magpies. [[Ovid]] tells this tale after explaining the origin of the Heliconian spring in ''[[Metamorphoses]]''{{nbsp}}V. The metamorphoses into magpies comes at the end of the book:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest of our number ended thus her learned songs; and with concordant voice the chosen Nymphs adjudged the Deities, on Helicon who dwell, should be proclaimed the victors. But the vanquished nine began to scatter their abuse; to whom rejoined the goddess; 'Since it seems a trifling thing that you should suffer a deserved defeat, and you must add unmerited abuse to heighten your offence, and since by this appears the end of our endurance, we shall certainly proceed to punish you according to the limit of our wrath.' But these Emathian sisters laughed to scorn our threatening words; and as they tried to speak, and made great clamour, and with shameless hands made threatening gestures, suddenly stiff quills sprouted from out their finger-nails, and plumes spread over their stretched arms; and they could see the mouth of each companion growing out into a rigid beak.{{snds}}And thus new birds were added to the forest.{{snds}}While they made complaint, these Magpies that defile our groves, moving their stretched-out arms, began to float, suspended in the air. And since that time their ancient eloquence, their screaming notes, their tiresome zeal of speech have all remained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theoi.com/Text/OvidMetamorphoses5.html#6, 
[662]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An early reference to the Pierian spring is found in the ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Petronius]], from the 1st century AD, at the end of section 5

But thou shalt ever lie dead,
nor shall there be any remembrance of thee then or thereafter,
for thou hast not of the roses of Pieria;
but thou shalt wander obscure even in the house of Hades,
flitting among the shadowy dead.}}

==Pope==
Lines 215 to 232 of [[s:An Essay on Criticism|Pope's poem]] read:

:"A little learning is a dang'rous thing;
:Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian spring:
:There shallow draughts intoxicate the brain,
:And drinking largely sobers us again.
:Fir'd at first sight with what the Muse imparts,
:In fearless youth we tempt the heights of Arts,
:While from the bounded level of our mind
:Short views we take, nor see the lengths behind;
:But more advanc'd, behold with strange surprise
:New distant scenes of endless science rise!
:So pleas'd at first the towering Alps we try,
:Mount o'er the vales, and seem to tread the sky,
:Th' eternal snows appear already past,
:And the first clouds and mountains seem the last;
:But, those attain'd, we tremble to survey
:The growing labours of the lengthen'd way,
:Th' increasing prospects tire our wand'ring eyes,
:Hills peep o'er hills, and Alps on Alps arise!"

In Greek mythology, it was believed that drinking from the Pierian Spring would bring you great knowledge and inspiration. Thus, Pope is explaining how if you only learn a little it can "intoxicate" you in such a way that makes you feel as though you know a great deal. However, when "drinking largely sobers" you, you become aware of how little you truly know.

The opening stanza also appears in [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', as Fire Captain Beatty chastizes Guy Montag, the protagonist, about reading books, which are forbidden in the society of the novel.

In his poem "Hugh Selwyn Mauberley," [[Ezra Pound]] refers to Pierian "roses" in a critique of the cheap aesthetic of his time, which in his opinion has replaced a true appreciation of art and knowledge:

"Conduct, on the other hand, the soul
&lt;br /&gt;'Which the highest cultures have nourished'
&lt;br /&gt;To Fleet St. where
&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Johnson flourished;

Beside this thoroughfare
&lt;br /&gt;The sale of half-hose has
&lt;br /&gt;Long since superseded the cultivation
&lt;br /&gt;Of Pierian roses."

[[Sir William Jones]] (1746–1794) also made reference to "the fam'd Pierian rill" (a brook or rivulet) in his poem about the origin of chess, "[[Caïssa|Caissa]]".

[[Henry Miller]] also made mention of it in his MOLOCH.

In the [[David Cronenberg]] remake of [[The Fly (1986 film)|The Fly]], the protagonist Seth Brundle succumbs to madness and disease as the result of a hubristic science experiment. During his descent into fanaticism in the movie's second act, he rants at the short-sightedness of his lover, proclaiming "drink deep, or taste not the plasma spring!". The usage is ironic; Brundle's inability to recognise the shortcomings of his knowledge{{snds}}and his experiment{{snds}}ultimately leads to his destruction.

'''''Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon''''' is a 1997 adventure video game, written by [[Paulo Coelho]], who wrote ''[[The Pilgrimage]]'', the novel on which the game is based. ''Pilgrim'' has been described as a "commercial cultural heritage game"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allianceexperts.com/en/knowledge/main-trends-serious-gaming-industry/|title=Main trends in the serious gaming industry|last=de Leede|first=Judith|date=|publisher=Alliance Experts|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "graphic interactive fiction".&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Pilgrim/Pilgrim_review.shtm |title=Review: Pilgrim |last=Ivey |first=Ray |date=July 20, 2001 |publisher=Just Adventure |access-date=2017-01-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010720051207/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/Pilgrim/Pilgrim_review.shtm |archivedate=July 20, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the premiere title of [[Arxel Tribe]]&lt;ref name=":102"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digiworldsummit2014.com/intervenant/guillaume-de-fondaumiere/|title=Guillaume DE FONDAUMIERE|last=|first=|date=November 20, 2014|publisher=DigiWorld Summit|access-date=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first in The Paulo Coelho trilogy, alongside ''[[The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Secrets of Alamut]]'' (2001).

==Plot==
[[File:Pilgrim, Faith as a Weapon_Petrus.jpg|left|thumb|368x368px|The second half of the game sees a tonal shift from the first; upon meeting the character of Petrus (&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;pictured&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;), ''Pilgrim'' goes beyond a series of fetch-quests and becomes infused with the philosophies of Coelho's source material novel encompassing a larger spiritual narrative.]]
The game is loosely based on [[Paulo Coelho]]'s autobiographical 1987 novel ''[[The Pilgrimage]]''. It is a time of superstition and religious persecution,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=https://web.archive.org/web/20091211202250/http://www.puntaeclicca.it/rec/pilgrim.html&amp;edit-text=&amp;act=url|title=Pilgrim (''Italian'')|last=Gioconda|first=Aspide|date=|website=Puntaeclicca|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Catharism]] reigns supreme. Set at the beginning of the [[Albigensian Crusade]] (1208) in the south of France, the story sees Simon Lancroix aim to complete his dying father's wishes of finding a secret manuscript and delivering it to a friend named Petrus. It is revealed that this actually a [[Coptic language|Coptic]] [[manuscript]] that a renegade [[Knights Templar|Templar]] brought back from [[Crusades]]; it is believed to be the lost [[Gospel of Saint Jean]]. This manuscript gets passed around to various characters and locations. Meanwhile, [[Pope Innocent III]] orders the inquisitor [[Diego de Osma]] to retrieve the manuscript. Mystical creatures such as angels and demons also become entangled in the battle.&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quedzasvideogames.free.fr/?page=pilgrim/pilgrim.php|title=Pilgrim  (''French'')|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Quedzas Video Games|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the game sees the player complete a series of tasks to help other characters, who in return help the player. Halfway through the game, the player meets Petrus, who reveals that the player's father was the leader of a fictional religious sect called "The Tradition", which aims to bring an absolute truth that no other religion can.&lt;ref name=":122"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/pilgrim/pilgrim.htm|title=Pigrim: Faith as a Weapon|last=Poussier|first=Damien|date=July 12, 2012|publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this point the game covers symbolic, spiritual, and supernatural philosophies such as dreams, peace, compassion, love, salvation, the four horsemen of the apocalypse, growing up and giving up, and re-learning what we knew as children; the final scene takes place in limbo.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Pilgrim'' is a first person point-and-click adventure. Players click through a series of static frames—a slideshow of pre-rendered 3D environments—to move around; one is not free of their movements and must often strategically click screen points in a certain order to reach a destination.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.abandonware-france.org/ltf_abandon/ltf_jeu.php?id=1238&amp;prev=search|title=Pilgrim: Par le Livre et par l'Epée (French)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Abandonware France|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cursor becomes an arrow to indicate a possible movement, and a click transitions the player to the next location.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; It is possible to die in the game; causes of death include the player failing to accomplish certain time-dependent challenges.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; If the player dies they are returned to the beginning of the latest checkpoint, often after a cutscene.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; There are also two unwinnable states; one of them occurs if the player gives all their money to a beggar in Toulouse, despite them needing the money to go past the very next door.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The player is encouraged to "save early, save often".&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The final puzzle of the game has been described as "no less than an exam about what you're supposed to have learned".&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The game comes with two discs, which are both required for game installation; regardless of where the player is, Disc 1 must be inserted every time the player boots up the game.

The "Inventory" interface contains three elements. "Bag" contains the acquired items&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; (the player is limited in the number of items and the weight they can carry).&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; "People" contains the characters that the player had encountered, knows about, or wants information on.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; "Items" contains the objects which have been seen or heard about but not acquired.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; "People" and "Items" of interest can be brought up as conversation topics with others.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; To use an item in "Bag", the player clicks on it to activate it (it then has a yellow box around it), then clicks "View".&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; To offer a topic of discussion, the player clicks on an item in the "People" or "Items" tabs to activate it, then clicks on a character in the "View" screen to talk about it.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The puzzles require both reflection and patience.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;  The "Bag" items and the clues within the "Encyclopedia" can be applied and manipulated to solve puzzles thereby advancing the story.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The latter is similar to how the Chronopedia in used in Broderbund adventure game ''[[Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time]]''.&lt;ref name="learningvillage12"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningvillage.com/html/rcstime.html|title=Carmen Sandiego's Great Chase Through Time|publisher=Learning Village|accessdate=October 27, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927155415/http://www.learningvillage.com/html/rcstime.html|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has a hint system to provide clues for the more obscure puzzles.&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt; The entries of the in-game "Encyclopedia" have been described as "spartan" due to consisting exclusively of text.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;  Sometimes when a character mentions a topic that is available in the encyclopedia during a conversation, a keyword will appear on the screen which may then be clicked to bring up the corresponding entry.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; While not required, this feature allows the player to delve deeper into the interesting historical nuggets that feature throughout the game.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The player has an in-game notebook, into which they may copy-paste extracts from the encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

The game would originally be called ''Pilgrim'' during the development stage, and by its release would subtitled with ''Faith as a Weapon.''&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;

Adventure gaming was chosen by Arxel Tribe because the genre had recently been experiencing technological advancements that were comparable to those seen in the shooting genre with new releases such as ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' (1993) and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' (1996), which opened up new graphical and narrative possibilities.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sl&amp;u=http://www.delo.si/druzba/delova-borza-dela/z-racunalniskimi-igrami-na-svetovni-trg.html&amp;prev=search|title=Z računalniškimi igrami na svetovni trg (''Slovenian'')|last=Ivanc|first=Staš|date=November 8, 2011|website=|publisher=Delo|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arxel Tribe aimed to create an adventure game with an "epic" and "gripping" narrative to give justice to the source material's "initiatory, romantic and spiritual journey".&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; They wanted to make a "humanist journey with a very deep story line", instead of being "just another adventure game".&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt; The development company collaborated with Coelho into adapting the story into more of an investigative detective mystery in order to better immerse the player while encouraging them to utilise their logic and imagination.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; The early 13th century was chosen as the game's time period due to its "historical and mythical richness" abundant with heresy, crusades, and errands by knights; the developers felt this was the ideal setting to illustrate the "generous and humanist philosophy" inherent in Coelho's book.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; Stephen Carrière expressed that video game manufacturers were drawn toward comic book writers, screenwriters or cartoonists due to their desire to create a unique graphic universe that sets the game apart from the rest of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.liberation.fr/ecrans/1999/05/07/des-bulles-dans-le-jeu-video-les-editeurs-de-jeux-sollicitent-de-plus-en-plus-les-auteurs-de-bande-d_272280&amp;prev=search|title=Les éditeurs de jeux sollicitent de plus en plus les auteurs de bande dessinée dont ils prisent la créativité et les qualités de scénariste (''French'')|last=Riviore|first=Annick|date=May 7, 1999|website=|publisher=Liberation|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matjaz Požlep said the company worked within an adventure gaming niche, and within it an intellectual gaming sub-niche.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Around this time 46 people were working on Arxel Tribe games at their Ljubljana company headquarters.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

}}While Guillaume de Fondaumière considered video gaming a mere extension of their 3D studio business, he was neither a programmer or graphic artist, so he assumed the role of producer and sought to find people who cared about the creative side of game development.&lt;ref name=":142" /&gt; With a team of "galley slaves", they managed to complete the game in a mere 15 months.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Moebius collaborated with Arxel Tribe artistic director Nicolas Fructus on the game's design elements to draw the concept art for scenes and characters.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.humano.com/profil/Nicolas%252BFructus&amp;prev=search|title=Nicolas Fructus dessinateur, scénariste (''French'')|last=Fructus|first=Nicolas|date=|website=|publisher=Humano|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development company felt that the drawings by Moebius enhanced the magical quality of the story, and provided a sense of cultural and spiritual curiosity, transcending the generic conventions of the adventure game genre.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; The 2D character design work was done in both Ljubljana and Paris, while the adaptation of the designs using 3D graphic software was completed in Ljubljana&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Computer artists created 3D images from Moebius' drawings using [[Silicon Graphics]] computers (such as Onyx and Indigo 2, which they had used in previous non-video game projects&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arxel.si/tribe/arxel0.htm |title=Arxel Tribe – History |last= |first= |date=1997 |publisher=Arxel Tribe |access-date=2017-01-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970626010109/http://www.arxel.si/tribe/arxel0.htm |archivedate=1997-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;); they mixed traditional computer graphics techniques, such as rigging, with motion capture in order to animate the characters.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.samohomsak.com/documents/SamoHomsak_resume.pdf|title=Samo Homsak|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's 3D engine was created in-house ar Pilgrim, and the computer-rendered elements like scenes and characters weremade to look on par with the top level video game developers of the time.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Marcin Mierzejewski Zenzire approached Arxel Tribe in 1996 to become a 3D modeller and animator, but was instead hired as a coder for this game. At the time the company had limited coding experience from their previous multimedia projects, so they needed a professional coder.&lt;ref name=":92"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sinistersystems.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=charon:past:arxeltribe|title=Arxel Tribe (1996–2003)|last=Zenzire|first=Marcin Mierzejewski|date=November 18, 2011|publisher=Sinister Systems|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Zenzire "set up the initial architecture for the game engine, coded some UI routines and the game's interactive encyclopedia", using expertise from his work using hypertext. He also "supervised the code and offered assistance with other programming tasks".&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt;

Early in development, a complete literature research was carried out in order to provide the team with a comprehensive and faithful design guide containing each historical element the project required, such as clothes, architecture, and landscapes.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; To give the player a colourful window into the complexities of the time period, a multimedia encyclopedia containing biographical information such as maps, articles, and paintings was included in-game; the over 150 page data bank is divided into three parts: "History &amp; Geography", "Life in the Middle Ages" and "Religion".&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt; This 13th century information was added to provide additional historical knowledge and context.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; The game was created with the participation of [[National Center of Cinematography and the moving image|Le Centre National de la Cinématographie]] and the Ministèr Délégué à la Poste aux Télécommunications et à l'Espace.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/pilgrim-faith-as-a-weapon/credits|title=Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon credits|last=|first=|date=|website=MobyGames|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the game's background music was not written for the game; it was instead chosen from preexisting music, largely from the Medieval and Romantic periods.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This includes: [[Symphony No. 1 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 1 in D major]] by [[Gustav Mahler]], a piece by [[Fernando Sor]], a guitar-transcribed version of [[Isaac Albéniz]]'s piano pieces [[Suite Española No. 1, Op. 47]] and [[Cantos de españa|Cantos de España]], and [[Greensleeves]].&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; The pieces are relatively short and loop indefinitely in their respective locations.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The game is in the SVGA 640x480 aspect ratio,&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; and was made available into English, French, German and Brazilian Portuguese.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;

===Release===
In June 1997, Arxel reported on their website that the game was likely to be completed that December, with a world release planned for the Spring of 1998.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; At the time, Parisian company Anne Carierre Multimedia was confirmed as co-producer of the game, while the major worldwide distribution companies were still being negotiated.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Later that year, Infogrames Entertainment signed a first publishing and distribution contract with Arxel Tribe.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt; The project was officially announced to the press during a candlelit dinner held in a castle in Ljubljana in September 1997, with an intended release date of November of that year.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; The small multimedia studio treated the journalists to a sample of local handicrafts at the beginning of the evening, and then invited them to a memorable conference in the castle hall.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=e35A889hwQ4C&amp;pg=PT218&amp;dq=%22pilgrim%22+%22arxel+tribe%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3od60uOfRAhWBFZQKHV_RDeoQ6AEISTAG#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pilgrim%22%20%22arxel%20tribe%22&amp;f=false|title=Relations Presse (French)|last=Ichbiah|first=Daniel|publisher=Daniel Ichbiah|year=|isbn=9781291317022|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game would be released in the US and Europe in November 1997 in English, French (''Pilgrim: Par le Livre et par l'Epée''), and German (''Pilgrim: Das Geheimnis der Schrift''), with a Brazilian Portuguese release entitled ''O Diário de um Mago'' being released in January 1998.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; The game ended up being published first in the UK in February 1998 by Infogrames Multimedia; the French publication was handled by [[Wanadoo Edition]] (formed by index+'s acquisition of France Télécom Multimédia), and the French trailer was created by Eurospace, advertised by Infogrames, and directed by Lioux Philippe.&lt;ref name=":72" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.ina.fr/video/PUB777003059|title=Pilgrim (''French'')|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Institut National de l'Audiovisuel|access-date=2017-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was also available for purchase via the Arxel Tribe webstore.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gameboomers.com/MemberReviews/Pp/pilgrimbyclovis.htm |title=Pilgrim |last=Clovis |first= |date=December 8, 2003 |publisher=Gameboomers |access-date=2017-01-31 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031208105211/http://www.gameboomers.com/MemberReviews/Pp/pilgrimbyclovis.htm |archivedate=December 8, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a promotion, Arxel Tribe announced they would give a free copy of the game to the first 200 people to send the company their full details.&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; In total, $2 million was invested into the venture; of this, $1 million went toward the production of the title by Arxel Tribe and Anne Carrière Multimedia, while another $1 million was spent to promote the title which was distributed worldwide by French company Infogrames.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; 250,000 copies of the video game were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fr.linkedin.com/in/gdefondaumiere |title=Guillaume de Fondaumière (''French'') |last= |first= |date=January 10, 2013 |work=LinkedIn |access-date=2017-01-29 |via= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130110061724/http://fr.linkedin.com/in/gdefondaumiere |archivedate=January 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just Adventure described ''Pilgrim'' as a "little-known title", noting that by the time of its sequel's release in 1999, ''Pilgrim'' had still never released in North America.&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/LOPA/LOPA.shtm |title=Review: The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin |last=Sluganski |first=Randy |date=July 20, 2001 |website= |publisher=Just Adventure |access-date=2017-01-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010720052507/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/LOPA/LOPA.shtm |archivedate=July 20, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It noted that there were three potential culprits to the gaming "gem" suffering in terms of recognition: little to no marketing by Arxel Tribe, the publisher not understanding how to sell the product, and the gaming industry simply being apathetic toward adventure games at the time.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; Game coder Marcin Mierzejewski Zenzire would later argue that while the title was a decent success among adventure fans and created a reasonable amount of media buzz, Arxel Tribe used the boom in popularity to promote themselves rather than the game, which meant a "comparatively small number of copies was printed and therefore sold out almost immediately".&lt;ref name=":92" /&gt; SK Online wrote that the game was only a half-hearted success, partly because of the lack of advertising, but also because it had some technical deficiencies when compared to its contemporaries.&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt; Clovis of Gameboomers noted that during its rollout, there were "significant delays in delivery".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; ''Just Adventure'' reported that ''Pilgrim'' was originally supposed to be included as a bonus feature in the release of ''[[The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin]]'', but that this idea was later abandoned, describing it as "yet another marketing mistake".&lt;ref name=":162"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/articles/Nobody_Played/10_Best.shtm |title=The 10 Best Adventure Games That (Almost) No One Has Ever Played |last=Sluganski |first=Randy |date=July 20, 2001 |website= |publisher=Just Adventure |access-date=2017-01-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010720064032/http://www.justadventure.com/articles/Nobody_Played/10_Best.shtm |archivedate=July 20, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article, published between the ''Pilgrim''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s original and re-releases, further explained that while the game was very rare, it could occasionally be located on eBay and the Game Trading Zone.&lt;ref name=":162" /&gt; In its review of ''[[The Secrets of Alamut]]'' in July 2001, ''Just Adventure'' wrote that ''Pilgrim'' had experienced a "rejuvenation in sales" in the time since it had been listed it in ''The Ten Best Games That (Almost) No One Has Ever Played'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/LOPA/Secrets.shtm |title=The Secrets of Alamut |last=Sluganski |first=Randy |date=July 16, 2001 |website= |publisher=Just Adventure |access-date=2017-01-30 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010716163008/http://www.justadventure.com/reviews/LOPA/Secrets.shtm |archivedate=July 16, 2001 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite that, in 2002 ''Tap Repeatedly'' would still lament that the game had sunk into relative obscurity between its 1998 and 2001 releases.&lt;ref name=":172"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tap-repeatedly.com/Reviews/Pilgrim/Pilgrim.shtml|title=Pilgrim: Faith as a Weapon|last=Enigma|first=|date=February 2002|website=|publisher=Tap Repeatedly|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, VGDb said the game was a "great success",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pl&amp;u=https://vgdb.pl/guillaume-de-fondaumiere&amp;prev=search|title=GUILLAUME DE FONDAUMIERE (''Polish'')|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=VGDb|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Arxel Tribe asserted that their game had been recognised by both players and critics for its originality and being faithful to Coelho's work.&lt;ref name=":192"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://web.archive.org/web/20020727234432/http://legend.arxeltribe.com/french/home/polarxel.html|title=Paulo Coelho &amp; Arxel Tribe (''French')|last=|first=|date=1999|website=|publisher=Arxel Tribe|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guillaume de Fondaumiere told ''Game.EXE'' that the game sold "surprisingly well", and that due to the efforts of Infogrames, 40,000 copies were sold in France alone.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; ''Relations Presse'' asserted that the game received an impressive number of articles in the public press as a result of their public relations stunt at the Ljubljana castle.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Damien Poussier of ''[[Hardcore Gaming 101]]'' asserted that ''Pilgrim'' is the resulting blend of the "relative seriousness" and "classic feel" of Arxel Tribe (which he compared with [[Cryo Interactive]]), the "great artwork" of Moebius, and the "ridiculous new age philosophy" and "low-grade proselytizing" of Coelho.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Poussier also compared the gameplay to ''[[Myst]]'' and liked that the game didn't follow the book too closely, noting that a "stain" of the "author's influence" wasn't noticeable until the game's midpoint; he thought the scene with Petrus was "completely out of the blue" and "filled with absolute nonsense that even the stonest of all hippies would find laughable".&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' reviewer also criticised the plasticy characters which did not resemble Moebius' work, having to wait for characters to complete an animation before answering each question, and the "excruciatingly awful" voice acting of many characters, particularly the incorrect French and Spanish accents.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; Poussier praised the atmospheric music, as well as the "well-handed" education despite lamenting that the encyclopedia would have been more paletable had its walls of text been sprinkled with some images.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;

After the release of ''Pilgrim'', Paulo Coelho decided to use this collaboration and newfound interest in interactive entertainment as the inspiration behind a recurring plot point in his 1998 novel ''[[Veronika Decides to Die]]'', which was released the same year as ''Pilgrim'' sequel ''The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin''. In ''Veronika Decides to Die,'' the suicidal Ljubljana-born heroine reads an article in the French magazine ''Homme'' about a computer game developed in Slovenia and written by Coelho''.''&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":192" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":202"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wiztrit.com/excerpt/?e=20t|title=Excerpt from Veronika Decides to Die|website=wiztrit.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many references to ''Pilgrim'' and Coelho's thoughts on the experience throughout the book; the following passage illustrates this:{{Quotation|text="''Having nothing more interesting to do, [Veronika] decided to read the whole article, and she learned that the said computer game had been made in Slovenia -that strange country that no one seemed quite able to place, except the people who lived there – because it was a cheap source of labor. A few months before, when the product was launched, the French manufacturer had given a party for journalists from all over the world in a castle in Vled.''  ''Veronika remembered reading something about the party; which had been quite an event in the city, not just because the castle had been redecorated in order to match as closely as possible the medieval atmosphere of the CD-ROM, but because of the controversy in the local press: Journalists from Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain had been invited, but not a single Slovene...''"|sign=Paulo Coelho|source=excerpt from his 1998 novel ''Veronika Decides to Die''&lt;ref&gt;http://wiztrit.com/excerpt/?e=20t&lt;/ref&gt;}}After ''Pilgrim'', it was decided that the " fruitful collaboration" between Arxel Tribe and Coelho would continue; this resulted in the creation of two more games set in the Medieval Middle East, creating an adventure trilogy.&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":192" /&gt; ''The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin'', also known as ''The Prophet's Trail'', (and called ''The Legend of As-Sayf: The Prophet and the Assasin'' during the development stage&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;), is sometimes referred to as ''Pilgrim II''; it is however less a direct sequel and more an "entirely new story about the same era as seen from another perspective", which carries over into the third game ''[[The Secrets of Alamut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mrbillsadventureland.com/reviews/k-l/legendarxR/legprophR.htm|title=The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin Review – Mr. Bill's Adventureland|website=www.mrbillsadventureland.com|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described by Guillaume de Fondaumiere as a "kind of continuation",&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; the game takes place 50 years after the events witnessed in ''Pilgrim'', although the game explores many of the same themes.&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt; Just Adventure noted that when the sequel was released in North America, ''Pilgrim'' still had not been, so there was no point in marketing the game as ''Pilgrim II''.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; In some releases the two games are considered ''Part 1'' and ''Part 2'' of the ''Legend'' series, with the bundled release also known as ''The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin''.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt; Throughout The Paul Coelho trilogy, ''Pilgrim'' protagonist Simon de Lancroix evolves from a "young, sense-seeking" person to someone who has "matured to a prophet, although not loved by everyone", according to Adventure-Archiv.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adventurearchiv.de/d/alamutreviewen.htm|title=The Secret of Alamut  – The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin Part 2 – Review english|last=slydos|website=www.adventurearchiv.de|access-date=2017-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231102536/http://www.adventurearchiv.de/d/alamutreviewen.htm|archivedate=2011-12-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Damien Poussier of ''Hardcore Gaming 101'' argues that while Simon de Lancroix is mentioned in the sequel, the name is not referring to the same character from ''Pilgrim''.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt; The Lancroix of the sequels is a European prophet who wanted to construct an oasis of peace called Jébus.&lt;ref name=":182" /&gt; The three titles which would form a collection; (alongside ''[[The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Secrets of Alamut]]'' (2001), which continued the story, the three games would be collectively be known as The [[Paulo Coelho]] trilogy).&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=pl&amp;u=http://www.gry-online.pl/S016.asp?ID=1701&amp;prev=search|title=Secrets of Alamut (''Polish'')|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Gry|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guillaume de Fondaumiere later said that while he was proud of the game, it was not particularly impressive by the standards of the time.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Many of the crew for this game would work together on other projects. 20 and 14 members of the creative team collaborated on ''[[Seven Games of the Soul|Faust: Seven Games of the Soul]]'' (1999) and ''[[The Legend of the Prophet and the Assassin]]'' (2000 – also written by Coelho), respectively.&lt;ref name="auto12" /&gt; Arxel Tribe would develop fifteen games, which would mostly share a series of common aspects: educational adventure games, set in specific historic times, and inspired by real or mythological events.&lt;ref name=":122" /&gt;  Arxel Tribe would eventually be renamed Art Rebel, and create the graphic production and modeling for French video game developer [[White Birds Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com.au/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://www.atlantisamerzoneetcie.com/jeux-dossier-lochness-visite-whitebirds.php&amp;prev=search|title=Visit to the studios of White Birds Productions  From Lochness|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Atlantis Amerzone Et Cie|access-date=2017-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rajgruha''' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]]: राजगृह) is a memorial and home of [[B. R. Ambedkar]] in [[Hindu colony]] of [[Dadar]] in  [[Mumbai]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It was named ''[[Rajgriha]]'' (now [[Rajgir]]) in the memory of the ancient Buddhist kingdom. This historic monument is a three-storeyed building, the ground floor of the house is a museum. The photographs and ashes of Babasaheb Ambedkar are open to visitors here. This place is holy site for Indians especially Ambedkarite Buddhists and Dalits. Ambedkar lived in 'Rajgruha' for nearly 15-20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timesnownews.com/india/article/five-must-visit-places-to-rediscover-the-life-of-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-chaitya-bhoomi-chaityabhoomi/140984|title=Five must visit places to rediscover the life of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar {{!}} India News|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.loksatta.com/mumbai-news/hawkers-encroachment-near-ambedkar-house-at-dadar-1148960/|title=बाबासाहेबांच्या ‘राजगृहा’च्या आसपास फेरीवाल्यांचा डेरा|date=2015-10-10|work=Loksatta|access-date=2018-11-28|language=mr-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Millions of people and his followers (especially ''Ambedkarite Buddhists and dalits'') have come here to showcase the mansions before the [[Chaitya Bhoomi]] in [[Shivaji Park]] on 6th December. It was a plan to make a national monument, but it was not possible due to some legal and technical issues. Ambedkar had collected more than 50,000 books at the Rajgaura. This was the largest personal library in the world at that time. In 2013, the house of the mansion became a heritage monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mahamanav Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar|last=Gaikwad|first=Dr. Dnyanraj Kashinath|publisher=Riya Publication|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=186|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://m.divyamarathi.bhaskar.com/news/MAH-MUM-dr-5268154-NOR.html|title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब अांबेडकरांच्या ‘राजगृह’ने घेतला मोकळा श्वास|work=divyamarathi|access-date=2018-11-28|language=mr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rajagriha, Bombay, February 1934. (L to R) Yashwant, BR Ambedkar, Ramabai, Laxmibai, Mukundrao, and Tobby.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Babasaheb Ambedkar]] with his family members at Rajgruha, his residence in Hindu Colony, Dadar (Bombay).

On February 1934]]

Babasaheb Ambedkar's early days went into a very poor state. After barrister, he started to practice law. And in the short run he became famous as a smart lawyer. And after 1930, their financial condition was improving. Ambedkar's office was near Damodar Hall in Parel. Since the number of people to meet him increased ambedkars house at paybadevi seemed small to accommodate such that it couldn't even accommodate his books. So he decided to build a new house for themselves. When Ambedkar was standing his own building, he had prepared a plan for himself to have a library. He tried his best to have the characteristics of the best libraries he had seen abroad. In that structure, two blocks of three to three rooms were built on the ground floor of the Rajagruha. In those two blocks, he had arranged for his family's living arrangements. On the first floor of the royal house, Babasaheb had arranged his own personal library and office along with his own convenience. He had prepared his own plan and arranged it accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mahamanav Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar|last=Gaikwad|first=Dr. Dnyanraj Kashinath|publisher=Riya Publication|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=186|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/the-house-ambedkar-built-in-mumbai-gets-scant-notice/article7626379.ece|title=The house Ambedkar built in Mumbai gets scant notice|last=Rashid|first=Omar|date=2015-09-08|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-11-28|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, he owned  99th and 129th numbered two plots of each of 55 square yard area in the [[Hindu colony]] of Dadar, Mumbai. On the plot of 129th Street in the fifth lane, decided to build a house to live with his family, while building a rented building on the 99th plot in the third lane. He got loan from Central Bank of India for construction and started construction immediately. The work of supervising the construction of Mr. Aaiskar has been appointed. In January of 1931, the construction of the building on the 129th plot was started. It was completed in 1933 and construction of the house of 'Rajgruha' was built. Construction of another building on plot number 99 started in 1932. After completion of the construction, they named the building as "Char Minar". The name 'Rajgruha' was related to [[Buddhist culture]] and [[Hindu culture]], whereas the name 'Char Minar' was related to [[Muslim culture]]. Construction of the building completed in 1933. In 1933, Babasaheb Ambedkar, along with his family, had come to live in his Rajgruha. B. R. Ambedkar, his wife [[Ramabai Bhimrao Ambedkar|Ramabai]] (son), Yashwant, Laxmibai (wife of his brother), Mukund (nephew) etc. lived in the Rajgruha. Ambedkar had more than 50,000 books in the Rajgruha, that time Rajgruha was the largest personal library in the world. Later on 9 May 1941, he sold the "Char Minar" building to pay for the purchase of books and loan of other things. However, they kept the house of Rajgruha for a permanent possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mahamanav Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar|last=Gaikwad|first=Dr. Dnyanraj Kashinath|publisher=Riya Publication|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=187|language=Marathi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many active '''religions in [[Luxembourg]]'''.

As of 2008, 72.4% of Luxembourg's population adhere to forms of [[Christianity]] (68.7% are [[Catholics]], 1.8% are [[Protestants]], while 1.9% adhere to other Christian denominations, especially [[Orthodox Christianity]]). 2.6% of the population follow non-Christian religions. 25% of the population do not have a religion.&lt;ref name="EVS"&gt;[http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/fr/actualites/2011/03/07-religion/ EVS Luxembourg 2008 CEPS/INSTEAD]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
Since 1979 it has been illegal for the government to collect statistics on religious beliefs or practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legilux.public.lu/leg/a/archives/1979/0291104/0291104.pdf#page=2 |title=Mémorial A, 1979, No. 29 |accessdate=1 August 2006 |format=PDF |publisher=Service central de législation|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2010 [[Pew Research Center]] study 70.4% are Christian, 2.3% Muslim, 26.8% Unaffiliated and 0,5% other religions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://features.pewforum.org/grl/population-percentage.php Global Religious Landscape] Pew Research Center 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent [[Eurobarometer|Eurobarometer Poll]] 2005,&lt;ref name=EUROBAROMETER&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_225_report_en.pdf |title=Eurobarometer on Social Values, Science and technology 2005 – page 11 |accessdate=5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''44%''' of Luxembourgish citizens responded that ''"they believe there is a God"''.
* '''28%''' answered that ''"they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"''.
* '''22%''' answered that ''"they do not believe there is any sort of spirit, God, or life force"''.

==State intervention==
Luxembourg is a secular state, but the Grand Duchy recognises and supports several denominations, in exchange for which, the state is allowed a hand in their affairs. This status, first afforded to the Catholic Church, stems from [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s [[Concordat of 1801]], the principles of which have continued to apply to Luxembourg, despite its separation from France in 1815 and its subsequent [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Dutch]] ownership.

Despite having the same roots as France's official position of ''[[laïcité]]'', Luxembourg's approach to religion has taken a different direction in the past 200 years, reducing the [[separation of church and state]], not increasing it. The state currently recognises the Catholic Church, Judaism, [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek]] and [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]], and Protestantism as officially mandated religions. In 2003, representatives of Islam, [[Anglicanism]], and [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian]] and [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian]] Orthodox Christianity engaged in discussions to be conferred similar status.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2005/51566.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2004 – Luxembourg]. 8 November 2004. US Department of State. ''URL accessed 24 May 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; A process began in the mid-2000s in which increasingly the tight entanglement between church and state in Luxembourg was questioned. This was partially stimulated by several events, such as the debate on [[Catholic Church sexual abuse cases|Catholic Church sexual abuse]] or the Grandduke's religiously motivated refusal to sign a [[euthanasia]] bill adopted by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://hpd.de/node/6023 |title=Luxemburg: Sterbehilfe depenalisiert |author=Manuel Huss |work= |publisher=Humanistischer Pressedienst |date=18 December 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2015 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the 2007 formation of an alliance of eight organisations, who made the [[separation of church and state]] their goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://hpd.de/node/3099 |title=Trennung von Kirche und Staat in Luxemburg |author=Grete Meißel |publisher=Humanistischer Pressedienst |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=24 June 2013 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a petition was launched under the name of ''Trennung.lu'' ("Separation.lu"), that demanded the separation of church and state in Luxembourg. It was supported by, amongst others, the youth wings of several political parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trennung.wollt.net/ |title=Trennung.lu |accessdate=2015-11-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701095132/http://trennung.wollt.net/ |archivedate=1 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Allianz vun Humanisten, Atheisten an Agnostiker]], founded in 2010, became one of the most vocal advocates of secularism in Luxembourg.

In January 2015, the government concluded a new convention with the recognised religions, regrouping the Greek, Romanian, Serbian and Russian Orthodox Churches in one Orthodox Church in Luxembourg, represented by the Metropolitan Archbishop of Belgium, Exarch of the Low Countries and Luxembourg, under the jurisdiction of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]], and adding the Anglican Church and the Muslim Community of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg to the list of recognised religions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gouvernement.lu/4369567/Convention.pdf Convention entre l’État du Grand-Duché de Luxembourg et les communautés religieuses établies au Luxembourg]&lt;/ref&gt; This convention has not yet entered into force, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gouvernement.lu/4369493/20-cdp-accord Accord du gouvernement avec les communautés religieuses établies au Luxembourg - Article on gouvernment.lu]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, seven non-religious organisations demanded a say in the negotiations about the future financing of religions by the state and the continuation of religion classes in public schools, both of which they demanded to be abolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.lessentiel.lu/fr/news/dossier/cultes/story/Les-non-religieux-veulent-aussi-etre-consultes-26709291 |title=Les non-religieux veulent aussi être consultés |work=[[L'essentiel (newspaper)|L'essentiel]] |publisher=Edita SA |date=18 January 2015 |accessdate=21 November 2015 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Catholic Church==
{{Main article|Catholic Church in Luxembourg}}

Catholicism is the most practised religion in Luxembourg. Luxembourg was a major centre for Christianity during the [[Middle Ages]], Catholicism was sustained through the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] by the hierarchy, buildings, and traditions established in the preceding centuries. The Catholic Church has received state support since 1801.

==Protestantism==
{{Main article|Protestantism in Luxembourg}}

[[Protestantism]] was outlawed in Luxembourg until 1768. By 1815, Luxembourg had small populations of [[Lutherans]], [[Calvinists]], and [[Waldensians]]. In 1885, there were 1,100 recorded Protestants out of 213,000 inhabitants of Luxembourg, that is 0.516%. By 1914, there were more than 6,000, or approximately 2.3%. Today it's 3%.

Protestantism is a [[minority religion]] in Luxembourg. They are divided across several Protestant churches and creeds, including [[Lutheranism]], [[Calvinism]], [[Anglicanism]], and diverse [[Evangelical Protestant]] churches. The largest Protestant churches in the Grand Duchy are the [[Protestant Church of Luxembourg]] (''PKL''), [[Protestant Reformed Church of Luxembourg]] (''PRKL''), [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], [[Church of England]], and [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]]. The state has supported the PKL since 1894 and the PRKL since 1982.

==Islam==
{{Main article|Islam in Luxembourg}}
In Luxembourg there is about 10,000 to 12,000 Muslims (est. 2009), who represent 2.2% of the total population. In addition, hundreds of Muslims come to work in Luxembourg every workday. According to a 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] report, approximately 13,000 Muslims in Luxembourg.&lt;ref name=bloop&gt;http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six mosques in Luxembourg as well as one multi-use room for Muslims, none of which have [[minaret]]s. Many Luxembourgian Muslims pray in mosques in France, Belgium or Germany. Most Muslims have origins in the [[Balkans]] ([[Bosniaks]] and [[Albanians]] approximately 60%), while Arab and other Muslim countries represent about 20%. Sub-Saharan Muslims account for about 5%, and 15% are other Europeans.

==Judaism==
{{Main article|History of the Jews in Luxembourg}}
Luxembourg's [[Jewish people|Jewish]] community dates back at least as far as the 13th century, making Judaism the minority religion that has been practised the longest in Luxembourg. Today, Luxembourg's Jews number approximately 1,200, of whom, 650 practise actively. There are very few [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] in Luxembourg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/anti-semitism/report_lux.html Manifestations of Anti-Semitism in the European Union – Luxembourg]. 1 December 2003. European Union. ''URL accessed 24 May 2006''.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Holocaust]], 1,945 Jewish Luxembourgers were killed, out of a pre-war population of 3,500. Judaism is supported by the state.

== Irreligion ==

[[File:AHA campagne stei dozou 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Allianz vun Humanisten, Atheisten an Agnostiker|AHA]]'s [[Atheist Bus Campaign]], spring 2011:&lt;br /&gt;"Not religious? Stand up for it!"]]
In the 2000s, surveys showed an increasing share of the population no longer feels connected to Catholicism. In 2002, 94% was still formally Catholic,&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993-2002) s.v. ''Luxemburg: feiten en cijfers''. Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum (in Dutch).&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2008, 25% of the Luxembourgers said they did not belong to any religion.&lt;ref name="EVS"/&gt; A lot of people were increasingly estranged by the Church's belief system, and yet were still members of it, solidifying the current situation. This caused both the association ''Liberté de conscience'' ("Freedom of Conscience") and the Internet portal ''sokrates.lu'' to launch the website ''Fraiheet.lu'' ("Freedom.lu") in 2009, to inform citizens about the options for [[religious disaffiliation]].

This secularisation, combined with the struggle to separate church and state, eventually led to the foundation of the [[Allianz vun Humanisten, Atheisten an Agnostiker]] in the spring of 2010. It intended to unite the hitherto scattered organised activities by humanist, atheist, agnostic, skeptical and secularist thinking people into one force.&lt;ref name="Auftakt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://hpd.de/node/10619 |title=AHA! Auftakt der Humanisten in Luxemburg |author=Fiona Lorenz |publisher=Humanistischer Pressedienst |date=11 November 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2015 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation was also explicitly welcomed by, amongst others, politicians from several parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://iheu.org/luxembourg-launches-humanist-association/ |title=Luxembourg launches Humanist association |work=IHEU website |publisher=[[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=21 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are around 4,500 [[Roman Catholics]] in the country of foreign origin.&lt;ref name="Group2004"/&gt; There are also a few adherents of [[Judaism]] working in the country.&lt;ref name="Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004"/&gt;

==History==
It was trade with Muslim merchants that brought Islam into the region, in the 8th century.&lt;ref name="Esposito2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=John L. Esposito|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6VeCWQfVNjkC&amp;pg=PA196|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=21 October 2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-512559-7|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Almoravid dynasty]] rose to power in the western [[Maghreb]] during the 11th century, and prosletyzed Islam throughout the region.&lt;ref name="Leonard2006"/&gt; Members of the Gadala Berbers brought back the theologian [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] from [[Mecca]] in 1035, where they traveled for the [[hajj]], to expunge the paganism still prevalent in Mauritania.&lt;ref name="Pazzanita2008"/&gt; Although Islam had existed in the region prior to the Almoravids, Almoravid rule accelerated the spread of Islam and removed [[animist]] influences on local Islamic practices.&lt;ref name="cs"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Country Study: Mauritania|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/mrtoc.html|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Yasin's strict interpretation of Islam alienated many of the Berbers, and the theologian was expelled. Undaunted, he accumulated a devoted following of loyal believers and an army, the foundation of the Almoravid dynasty. ibn Yasin's military expansion converted tribe members of the Gadala, Lemtuma, and Messufa Berbers of the region to Islam. The capture of [[Sijilmasa]] and [[Aoudaghost]], important cities in the [[Trans-Saharan trade]], allowed them to dominate the trade routes of the Sahara. The Almoravids converted the Berbers inhabiting modern-day Mauritania to the [[Maliki]] school of [[Sunni Islam]], which remains dominant in Mauritania to this day.&lt;ref name="Pazzanita2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pazzanita|first=Anthony G. |title=Historical Dictionary of Mauritania|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KU_9MfXKKYC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=1 August 2012|year=2008|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8108-5596-0|pages=58–60|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ibn Yasin was succeeded by [[Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], a chieftain of the Lamtuna Berbers. Fighting between the Lemtuma and Messufa led ibn Umar to declare a holy war against the [[Ghana Empire]] to unify the tribes against a common enemy. The war, which lasted for fourteen years, spread Islam to the members of the [[Soninke people]], founders of Ghana.&lt;ref name="Pazzanita2008"/&gt;  The political influence of the Almoravids waned as the dynasty declined, but Islamic adherence was firmly cemented in the country.&lt;ref name="cs"/&gt;

The political influence of the [[Kunta (tribe)|Kunta tribe]] between the 16th and 18th centuries bolstered the popularity of [[Qadiriyya|Qadiri Sufism]] in the region.&lt;ref name="Lapidus2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ira M. Lapidus|title=A History of Islamic Societies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3mVUEzm8xMC&amp;pg=PA416|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=22 August 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-77933-3|pages=409–410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 16th and 18th centuries, declaration of [[jihad]]s by Muslim theologians pushed for the establishment of Islamic governance in West Africa. In the 17th century, Nasir al-Din led a jihad in Mauritania, drawing support from Berbers frustrated with the corruption of the region's Arab rulers.&lt;ref name="cs"/&gt;

The [[French colonial empire]] expanded into Mauritania by the 19th century.&lt;ref name="cs"/&gt; The West African jihads were brought to an end, following crackdowns by British and French colonists.&lt;ref name="Lapidus2002"/&gt; In an effort to thwart militarism and threats of rebellion, French colonial administrators encouraged the influence of zaqiya, the religious tribes of Mauritania, over hassan, Mauritania's warrior tribes.{{sfn|Pazzanita|2008| pp=277-278}}

===Post-independence ===
The country declared its independence in 1960 and established itself as an [[Islamic Republic]].&lt;ref name="Pazzanita2008"/&gt; Independence brought [[Moktar Ould Daddah]] into power, who promoted Islam during his rule. A military coup d'état ousted Daddah in 1978.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurston|first=Alex|title=Mauritania's Islamists|url=http://carnegieendowment.org/2012/03/01/mauritania-s-islamists#|work=Carnegie Paper|publisher=Carnegie Endowment|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonel [[Mohamed Khouna Ould Haidalla]], one of the participants of the coup, became head of the government in 1980, and implemented [[Sharia]] law. [[Maaouya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya]], successor of Ould Haidalla, reversed some of these changes, but was ousted in a military coup in 2005.&lt;ref name="ce"/&gt;

Political Islam, or [[Islamism]], was introduced in the region during the 1970s. The instability that followed the coup that deposed Daddah invited elements of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], [[Wahabbism]], and [[Tablighi Jamaat]]. The Islamists united as a political party in the 1980s, but were politically repressed starting in 1994.&lt;ref name="SoaresOtayek2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Benjamin F.

Funding by [[Saudi Arabia]] and other Gulf monarchies supported the establishment of Islamic schools, centers, and charities around the country, but were largely shut down by the government in 2003.  In 2005, Islamists were arrested and accused of terrorism. Of the original eighty arrested, eighteen remained in prison by 2006.&lt;ref name="us"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mauritania|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2006/71313.htm|work=International Religious Freedom Report 2006|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
[[File:Chinguetti-biblio.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Qur'an]] collection in a library in [[Chinguetti]]]]
Islam is by far the largest and most influential religion in the country, and has been since the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Pazzanita2008"/&gt; According to government census, 100% of the country's citizens are Muslim.&lt;ref name="CIA"/&gt; Like much of North Africa, Mauritanians  follow the Maliki school of Islam.&lt;ref name="Pazzanita2008"/&gt;

Islam is the [[state religion]], and [[sharia]] is used as the basis of judicial decisions.&lt;ref name="Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004"/&gt; The five member High Council of Islam determines the compatibility of secular laws with Islamic laws.&lt;ref name="Group2004"/&gt;

==Government restrictions on religion==
In Mauritania, religious and secular NGOs are granted [[tax exemption]].&lt;ref name="Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004"&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04dlwzB2SvcC&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=1 August 2012|date=4 August 2005|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-072552-4|pages=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[Apostasy in Islam|sharia stance on apostasy]], the government forbids converting Muslims to competing religions. The publication of religious materials that are not Islamic is restricted. Religious education is considered mandatory, but only makes up a small portion of the public school curriculum.&lt;ref name="Annual Report on International Religious Freedom, 2004"/&gt;

According to the [[Pew Research Center]], although social conflict caused by religious hostilities is ranked Low in Mauritania, the amount of government restriction on the practice of religion is ranked High. Mauritania is the twelfth most religiously restrictive country in the world, ranked between [[Indonesia]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Restrictions on Religion |url=http://www.pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/restrictions/restrictionsfullreport.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117012234/http://www.pewforum.org/newassets/images/reports/restrictions/restrictionsfullreport.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shankaracharya''' ([[IAST]]: ''Śaṅkarācārya'', Shankara [[acharya]]) is a commonly used title of heads of monasteries called [[matha]]s in the [[Advaita Vedanta]] tradition. The title derives from [[Adi Shankara]], an 8th-century AD reformer of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Aditya Thakur"&gt;{{cite news|title=Just A Handful Of Hindus Know Adi Shankaracharya Revived Their Religion|url=http://topyaps.com/just-handful-hindus-know-adi-shankaracharya-revived-religion|accessdate=16 May 2014|newspaper=Topyaps|date=1 November 2014|author=Aditya Thakur}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is honored as ''Jagadguru'', a title that was used earlier only to [[Krishna]].

The popular view among historians{{Who|date=December 2014}} is that there were four Mathas or Peethas (religious orders):[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanchi_Kamakoti_Peetham]

* The ''Dakshiānmnāya Sri Sharada Peetham'' (Main Matha) or the [[Sringeri Sharada Peetham|Shri Sringeri Sharada Peetham]] in [[Shringeri|Sringeri]], [[Karnataka]].
* The ''Uttarāmnāya matha'' (Northern Matha) or the [[Jyotir Math|Jyotirmath Peetham]] in the city of [[Jyotirmath|Jyotirmath, Badrikashram]] also known as Joshimath, [[Uttarakhand]].
* The ''Pūrvāmnāya matha'' (Eastern Matha), or the [[Govardhana matha|Govardhan Peetham]] at [[Puri]], [[Odisha]].
* The ''Paśchimāmnāya matha'' (Western Matha), or the [[Dwaraka Pitha|Dwarka Sharada Peetham]] at [[Dwarka]], [[Gujarat]].

It is believed that after establishing the above  four mathas and appointing his four  disciples as head of  these mathas, [[Adi Shankara]] established a fifth matha at [[Kanchipuram]] and became the head of that matha till his life time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kamakoti.org/kamakoti/details/Shankaracharya-Kanchipuram%20Home.html&lt;/ref&gt; This fifth matha is called [[Kanchi Kamakoti Peetham]]

Shankaracharya is also seen as an [[avatar]] of [[Shiva]] (Shankara). Shankaracharya is responsible for founding many ''punyakshetras'' along the length and breadth of India, by taming avatars of [[Parvati]] and imprisoning her essence in [[Sri Chakra]]s.

Adi Shankaracharya wished to grace the Indian subcontinent by establishing four major mathas in the four corners of the peninsula – north (Jyothirmath), south (Sringeri), east (Puri), west (Dwaraka) – to propagate the philosophy of advaita vedanta and to promulgate the concept of ''Sanatana dharma'', thus establishing dharma or righteousness, as the way of life of people. His primary four disciples took charges of each math and thus established a strong Guru-Sishya ''parampara'' (a lineage of masters-disciples) in every math, that continues to guide people to this day.

'''Sister-books''' ({{lang-de|Schwesternbuch}}) is the term for a group of texts in the [[medieval literature]]. These works were written by Dominican [[nuns]] in the first half of the [[fourteenth century]] in [[South Germany]] and [[Switzerland]]. They relate the mystical experiences of sisters within the monastery, and were influential in the development of medieval [[mysticism]].&lt;ref name="Lindgren"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindgren |first1=Erika |editor1-last=Schauss |editor1-first=Margaret |title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |pages=761-762 |chapter=Sister Books and Other Convent Chronicles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

Some of the sister-books begin with a brief, mostly legendary, outlines of the founding history of the monastery, but less attention is paid to the historical facts than to the sentiments and heroic actions of founders. The central content of the books consists of reports on the lives of deceased members of the convent.&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Gertrud|title=By Women, for Women, about Women: The Sister-Books of Fourteenth-Century Germany|date=1996|publisher=Pontifical Instute of Mediaeval Studies|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sister-books depict not only convent sisters, but also lay nuns and sometimes also men associated with the convent. The presentation usually concentrates on those events in which the subject has acted in an exemplary manner, especially through visions or mystical experiences. Occasionally, the reverse is also shown, when a person's failure or the loss of graces is reported. Essential aspects of the monastic as well as the individual religious life come up, along with current theological problems from questions of monastic obedience to the [[Calvinism#Five_points_of_Calvinism|doctrine of grace]] and the [[Trinity]] dogma. Other themes include co-suffering with Christ and the question of the soul.

==Literary form==

The sister-books are a type of medieval lives literature, in which each work relates the lives of a number of people. These descriptions focus on the person's relationship to God and their behavior in the monastic community.&lt;ref name="Medieval Germany"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=Gertrud |editor1-last=Jeep |editor1-first=John |title=Medieval Germany: An Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge |pages=723-724 |chapter=Sister-Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This genre of writing was similar to the Vitae Fratrum of male Dominican orders, which in turn was heavily influenced by the [[Vitae Patrum]], a collection of sayings from early Christian monks.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Gerard de Fracheto: ''Vitae fratrum Ordinis Praedicatorum necnon Cronica ordinis ab anno MCCIII usque ad MCCLIV.'' Hrsg. v. Benedictus Maria Reichert. Löwen 1896 (Monumenta Ordinis Fratrum Praedicatorum Historica I).&lt;/ref&gt; The sister-books are also characterized by both the forms and structures of legendary narrative and the vocabulary and motifs of mysticism; the texts take images and metaphors quite seriously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamburger|first1=Jeffrey|title=Nuns as Artists: The Visual Culture of a Medieval Convent|date=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, note that all but one of the sister-books were written in the German vernacular, while the Unterlinden sister-book was written in Latin. None of the original manuscripts of the sister-books survive to this day; scholars rely on later copies, some of which were done as early as the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; 

==Significance==

While the sister-books were often devalued as products of naive nuns and as an expression of a flattened mysticism in earlier scholarship, today they find new attention as authentic testimonies of a women's monastic writing culture. Since only men were permitted to write theological treatises, highly educated women turned to narrative forms, especially in the form of vision narratives, to explain or discuss concepts of religious thought and action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winston-Allen|first1=Anne|title=Convent chronicles: women writing about women and reform in the late middle ages|date=2004|publisher=Pennsylvania State University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, these books are important documents for the history of German mysticism. They show that mysticism in women's monasteries was not just a consequence of Dominican preaching; rather, it preceded it in some monasteries. In the discourse on women's religious experiences, [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Heinrich Seuse]] and others developed their mystical theology and pastoral care.

The importance of music in Taoist ceremony is demonstrated by revealing how central beliefs are reflected through elements of music such as pandas, instrumentation and rhythm.  The ritual celebrating the birth of [[Guanyin]] was observed at the [[Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia]], Deagon to identify structure, role of participants, music forms and instrumentation.  Expression of spiritual beliefs through music enables followers of Taoism to enhance their path to enlightenment.

== Music in Taoist ceremony== 
Music has long played an integral part in religious ceremonies.  In [[Taoism|Taoist]] ceremonies, music has several different functions.  Taoists believe that music is a way to speak to the gods, to inspire religious followers and to achieve inner harmony, bringing the listener or participant closer to Tao.  Tao is the path to enlightenment, the goal of all followers of the Taoist faith.  To follow Tao is to recognise the inner harmony and balance in all living things. This belief is often represented in the [[Yin Yang]] symbol. In the ceremony witnessed at the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia, Deagon, the birth of [[Quan Yin]], the goddess of mercy was celebrated.  Music and instrumentation played a central role in this ritual.  The priests sung each chant and prayer to their gods, and accompanied these on musical instruments.  The musical expression of a Taoist ceremony supports the core beliefs of the religion.  Firstly, the role of music in the ceremony will be described, showing its religious importance to Taoism.  Secondly, this relates the structure of the birth of [[Quan Yin]] ceremony to the achievement of Tao.  The principal doctrines of Taoism and the roles of the various participants in the ceremony will also be described. Following this, the demeanour of participants and the physical setting of the ceremony will be illustrated.  Studying the role of music in Taoist ceremony will demonstrate the importance of music in religion as a means to inspire followers, improve and deepen faith, and enable communication with gods.  Describing how the music in the ceremony witnessed communicates and confirms the belief systems of Taoism will reveal music is as intrinsic to the Taoist as the path of Tao itself.

==Background on Taoism==
Taoism or Daoism, as it is commonly referred to, is an ancient Chinese religion and philosophy.  Taoism can be traced to a 6th-century B.C. scripture written by [[Lao Tzu]], the [[Tao Te Ching]] (Verellen, 1995).  Tao Te Ching translates into the classic of the way and its virtue .  The writings of the Tao Te Ching support passive behaviour and promote natural harmony with nature.  The main underlying theme to the writings is the value of wu-wei, (non-striving) “by which one returns to a primitive state closer to the Tao”. (Duyvendak, Chan, Lau, Mitchell, &amp; Mair, 2005).   These writings are considered to be influenced by [[Buddhist]] ideals, [[Confucian]] philosophy and traditional ancient Chinese mysticism ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).

==Anecdote drawn from the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia==
The priests of the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia are devotees of an order of Taoism known as the Evergreen Taoist Religious Order (EVTRO).  They follow the teachings of the “principal canons” of Taoism (Verellen, 1995).  The Taoists of the EVTRO believe in being apart from the need of worldly possessions, and aim at creating a solidarity and harmony between heaven and man.  One way in which they hope to achieve this is by giving freely of their time in public ceremonies to help others come closer to their own inner harmony.

In the Taoist ceremony of the birth of [[Quan Yin]], music was a key component of the service.  The entire dialogue of the ritual was intoned or sung by the priests, and these prayers were always accompanied by instrumentation ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  The chanting and instrumentation are used by the priests of Taoism as a tool to achieving the Tao (Bowker, 2000).  The Tao is described as the way or the path (Park, 2001).  Taoists understand that by following the path of Tao and reaching a balance with all things a human can gain self-realization.  Music assists the follower on his/her path to the Tao by helping to communicate with gods, reach inner harmony and come closer to finding balance with the world.

==Yin and Yang tones==
The principal belief of the [[Yin Yang]] is reflected in the categorisation of musical tones.  The two main forms of Taoist music are the Yin Tone and the Yang Tone ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  Yin stands for all things that are female and soft and Yang stands for all things male and hard.  Through the proper balance of Yin (female) and Yang (male) a Taoist can find harmony and simplicity in all things (Bowker, 2000).  Taoists strive to have these cosmic forces within themselves and around them at peace and in balance (Keown, 2003). 

The Yang tone is used in rituals mainly for the benefit of the priests, spirits and gods [http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  .  The ceremony held to celebrate the birth of the god Quan Yin, one of the deities of Taoism, started with chanting in the Yang tone. The other form, Yin Tone, is music aimed at appeasing and entertaining the general populace.  This creates a harmony with the Yang tone, by giving to the people what the Yang tone gives to the gods and priests.  Yin tones are usually performed at outer altars to inspire the populace in their beliefs and are livelier and more melodic than Yang tunes (Long, 2005).  The ceremony of the birth of Quan Yin consisted of elements of both the Yang tone and the Yin tone.  This combination of tones symbolizes the balance Taoists strive to achieve.  

The Yang tones were initially staged in the hall of the three purities.  The three purities are the highest deities in Taoism and they are said to reside over the heavens (Murashige, 2005).    The ceremony involved three female priests, two of which wore robes of simple red and black and the main priest wore a richly decorated robe of a jade colour.  The priests stood in front of the three purities and read from prayer books before them.  The priests maintained this formation throughout the entire ceremony until the end, when the main priest led them in single file around each of the altars in the temple to pay their respects to the other gods.

The ceremony started with the three priests chanting in a mono syllabic, often repeated phrase with only slight melodic deviation from the tonic.  The melodic deviation was rising in a pentatonic style chord then dropping in similar pentatonic step wise motion until the melody arrived back at the tonic, in a wave type phrase (Figure 2).  Most melodic phrases in the ceremony ended in descending tones, heading back to the tonic (to gain harmony and balance, like yin-yang) before starting the next phrase.  Later on, as the ceremony was finishing off, the music strayed from the Yang Tone and headed more towards the Yin tone.  The priests made their way around the temple to the other places of worship and the forecourt, for the purpose of the general populace observing the ritual.  The prayers in this section were still somewhat intoned.  More melodic phrasing was heard and the rhythms became faster and more syncopated.  These rhythms, syncopations and melodic ideas all relate to the core belief of Taoism, balance and harmony.  

The demeanour and interaction between the priests and worshippers reflected an air of individual focus.  The priests were constantly absorbed on the prayers, chanting, and rhythm and ignored all other matters.  Many other worshippers came and went as the ceremony progressed and paid their respects to the three purities and the two adjoining altars on either side of the main altar, at which the ceremony was held.  The worshippers made no appearance of solemnity towards the ceremony and came and went as they pleased, leaving incense offerings and praying.  In the following of Tao, each of these worshippers had their own inner harmony and this in no way intruded on the Tao of the ceremony, or the Tao of the priests.

==Instruments and gestures==
The priests in the ceremony used a variety of instruments.  The main priest used hand movements and ritual objects influenced by Chinese mysticism.  These gestures are used in Yang tone ceremonies in combination with magical instruments ([http://english.ccnt.com.cn/?catog=music&amp;file=020300&amp;page=3&amp;ads=service_001,2005]).  Magical instruments are believed to manifest magical powers during rituals.  The Yang tone is mainly played with magical instruments such as the Qing (metal bowl) and the Faqi (ritual percussion section). The Faqi often consisted of large drums, bells, and wooden fish blocks called Muyu (Jones, 2005).  These are played to help mediation and to compliment the ritual actions of the priests (Hong, 2005).  The musical instruments used in this ceremony, the Qing and the Muyu, are said to be indispensable (Hong, 2005).  These are also used to set the time of the chanting and to add to the religious atmosphere.  Through most of the parts of the ceremony a steady beat on the Muyu (Figure 5) and Qing (Figure 4) accompanied the chanting, with sections between prayers ending with a syncopated rhythm of the Qing and Muyu (Figure 3).

==Themes==
Music has been established as a key element of Taoist ceremony.  By examining the role of music in Taoist rituals, it is evident that instrumentation and vocalisation play central roles.  The structure of the event has been shown to symbolise the balance ideal of Taoism.  The core concept of Yin-Yang balance has been revealed as a theme that is acknowledged in areas of ceremony such as intonation, melodic deviation, rhythm and form.  The conduct of the various participants and the setting of the ceremony have also been outlined.  By examining the ceremony of the birth of Quan Yin, at the Evergreen Taoist Church of Australia, it is clear that music is used to guide its followers and practitioners on their path to universal harmony. In the balanced philosophy of Taoism without music there would only be silence, solitary, alone and unbalanced.

Based in downtown Boston, in the former ''Boston Post'' daily newspaper building (which, in its cellars four stories underground, still contains the century-old pulleys-and-lifts system equipment for the publishing presses of those days) overlooking what was known in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as "newspaper row", ''The Jewish Advocate'' has published weekly every week since its founding over one hundred fifteen years ago.  The paper is the primary Jewish newspaper for the Greater Boston and Eastern Massachusetts metropolitan area, and for much of New England, with subscribers in all 50 states and 14 foreign countries. It is available both in paper form and online.

==History==
''The Advocate'' was founded by [[Theodor Herzl]], Austrian journalist and founder of modern political [[Zionism]].  Having founded the Vienna newspaper ''[[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]]'' and the [[First Zionist Congress]] in Basel in 1897, Herzl sent his executive secretary [[Jacob de Haas]] to Boston several years later to start a newspaper which would "inculcate Judaism into the community and progress the cause of the re-establishment of the Jewish faith and a Jewish state."  The paper has been owned by only two families since that time.

In 1917 de Haas became national executive director of the newly organized Zionist Organization of America at the invitation of [[Louis D. Brandeis]], who had just become president of the ZOA, and ownership of ''The Jewish Advocate'' passed to Alexander Brin, who, as a national reporter for the former ''[[Boston Traveler]]'' daily newspaper, had become well-known through his coverage of the [[Leo Frank]] case in Atlanta, Georgia.  A year later ''The Advocate'' played a leading role in supporting the appointment of Brandeis as the first Jewish justice on the Supreme Court of the United States, and nearly thirty years later in the establishment of Brandeis University.

Through the next years Jewish population in Boston boomed and ''The Advocate'' became a household companion in virtually every Jewish home.  In the years before [[the Holocaust]] ''The Jewish Advocate'', virtually alone among the media, warned of the coming of [[Hitler]] and the great danger which that would pose for the Jewish people.

Subsequently the paper played an important leading role in uniting the nascent Jewish organizations that helped to rebuild the lives of Jewish refugees and establish the new [[State of Israel]].  This was the defining role of ''The Jewish Advocate'' throughout the decades of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s when the paper was at the forefront of every aspect of the Jewish community's social and religious issues and movements.

In the years following the 1960s and until today, with subscribers in all 50 states, Israel and 13 other foreign countries, ''The Jewish Advocate'' continues to serve as a primary source of news and information as well as a forum for discussion and debate, providing lines of communication uniting the community and supporting the efforts aimed at reinvigorating and broadening Jewish religious and cultural life.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5617">'''La Prière du Para (The Paratrooper's Prayer)''' is a [[French literature|French]] [[poetry|poem]] found in the possession of the presumed [[author]], [[Aspirant]] ([[Lieutenant|Brevet-Lieutenant]]) [[André Zirnheld]], upon his death in [[Libya]] on June 27, 1942.  The Paratrooper's Prayer has been adopted by all [[List of French paratrooper units|French Metropolitan and Marine Infantry Paratrooper Units and Regiments]] except for the parachutist of the [[List of French paratrooper units|French Foreign Legion]] who have [[2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment|their own poem]], as well as the [[Parachute Troops School|Portuguese Paratroopers]].
The Prayer appears before [[A. J. Quinnell]]'s novel ''[[Man on Fire (Quinnell novel)|Man on Fire]]'', the main [[protagonist]] of which is an ex-paratrooper in the [[List of French paratrooper units|Legion]].  This prayer also appears in Lt. Col. [[Dave Grossman (author)|Dave Grossman]]'s book, ''[[On Combat: The Psychology and Physiology of Deadly Conflict in War and in Peace]]'' and ''Rogue Heroes'' by [[Ben Macintyre]].

'''The Prayer of the Paratrooper'''
:(Translation by Robert Petersen)
&lt;poem&gt;
I'm asking You God, to give me what You have left.
Give me those things which others never ask of You.
I don't ask You for rest, or tranquility.
Not that of the spirit, the body, or the mind.
I don't ask You for wealth, or success, or even health.
All those things are asked of You so much Lord,
that you can't have any left to give.
Give me instead Lord what You have left.
Give me what others don't want.
I want uncertainty and doubt.
I want torment and battle.
And I ask that You give them to me now and forever Lord,
so I can be sure to always have them,
because I won't always have the strength to ask again.
But give me also the courage, the energy,
and the spirit to face them.
I ask You these things Lord,
because I can't ask them of myself.
&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem&gt;
Je m'addresse à vous, mon Dieu, car vous donnez
Ce qu'on ne peut obtenir que de soi
Donnez-moi, mon Dieu, ce qui vous reste
Donnez-moi ce qu'on ne vous demande jamais.

Je ne vous demande pas le repos
Ni la tranquillité
Ni celle de l'âme, ni celle du corps.
Je ne vous demande pas la richesse
Ni le succès, ni même la santé.

Tout ça, mon Dieu, on vous le demande tellement
Que vous ne devez plus en avoir.
Donnez-moi, mon Dieu, ce qui vous reste
Donnez-moi ce que l'on vous refuse.

Je veux l'insécurité et l'inquiétude.
Je veux la tourmente et la bagarre
Et que vous me les donniez, mon Dieu, définitivement.
Que je sois sûr de les avoir toujours
Car je n'aurai pas toujours le courage
De vous les demander.

Donnez-moi, mon Dieu, ce qui vous reste.
Donnez-moi ce don't les autres ne veulent pas.
Mais donnez-moi aussi le courage
Et la force et la foi.
Car vous seul donnez, mon Dieu,
Ce que l'on ne peut attendre que de soi.

'''The Prayer of the Paratrooper'''
I call out to you, my God, because you give
What we cannot get by ourselves 
Give me, my God, what remains
Give me what no one ever asks of you.

I do not ask for rest
Nor tranquility
Whether that of the soul or the body.
I ask not for wealth,
Or success, or even health.

All that, my God, you are asked so much for
That you no longer have them.
Give me, my God, what remains
Give me what others refuse.

I want insecurity and anxiety.
I want turmoil and brawl.
And that you give them to me, my God, forever 
So that I am always sure to have them.
For I will not always have the courage to ask.

Give me, my God, what you have.
Give me what others do not want.
But also give me courage
And strength and faith.
Because only you alone can give, my God,
What I cannot expect only from myself.
&lt;/poem&gt;

'''Oraçāo do Páraquedista'''
Dai-me Senhor, o que Vos resta
Aquilo que nunca ninguém Vos pede 
Eu não Vos peço o repouso
Nem a tranquilidade
Nem a da alma, nem a do corpo
Eu não Vos peço a riqueza,
Nem o êxito,
Nem mesmo a saúde.
Tantos vos pedem isso, Senhor, 
que já não Vos deve sobrar para dar.
Dai-me Senhor, o que Vos resta.
Dai-me aquilo que todos recusam.
Eu quero an insegurança e a inquietaçao
Eu quero a luta e a tormenta
E concedei-me-las, meu Senhor, definitivamente.
Que eu tenha a certeza de as ter para sempre
Porque não terei sempre a coragem
De Vos Lhas pedir.
Dai-me Senhor, o que Vos resta.
Dai-me aquilo que os outros não querem.
Mas dai-me também a Coragem
E a Força
E a Fé.
Amen.

'''Prayer of the Paratrooper'''
Give me, O Lord, what remains Thine;
What no one ever asks of Thee.
I do not ask Thee for rest 
Nor tranquility,
Neither of the soul nor of the body.
I do not ask Thee for riches,
Nor success, 
Nor even health.
So many ask you for these, O Lord,
Thou shouldst no longer have anything left to give.
Give me Lord, what remains Thine.
Give me that which all of us refuse.
I want insecurity and restlessness,
I want struggle and trouble.
And grant them to me, My Lord, forever.
Make sure that I will always take them
Because I will not always have the courage 
To ask of Thee for them.
Give me, O Lord, what remains Thine,
Give me what others do not want;
But give me also the Courage,
And the Strength, 
And the Faith.
Amen.

'''''The Perfect Matrimony''''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anael.org/sites/default/files/the_perfect_matrimony.pdf The Perfect Matrimony]&lt;/ref&gt; or '''''The Door to Enter Into Initiation''''', is the first of approximately seventy books written by [[Samael Aun Weor]]. It was first published in 1950 then revised and amplified in 1961.

It describes the [[esoteric]] teachings of [[alchemy]], [[tantra]], [[kabbalah]], the mysteries of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Aztec]]s, [[ancient Egypt]]ians, [[Tibetans]], and [[Essenes]], among others. The sexual aspect of religion is stressed in every religion it covers, stating bluntly that “the topic of this book is exclusively Sexual Magic.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=Introduction |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sex magic|Sexual magic]] is explained as the synthesis of all [[religion]]. From the introduction of the 1960 edition:

:''Sexual magic is practiced in esoteric Christianity. Sexual magic is practiced in Zen Buddhism. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the Initiated Yogis. Sexual magic is practiced amongst the [[Muslim]] [[Sufi]]s. Sexual magic was practiced in the Initiatic Colleges of Troy, Egypt, Rome, Carthage, Eleusis. Sexual magic was practiced by the mysterious Maya, Aztec, Inca, Druids, etc.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=Introduction |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author presents a wide selection of religion and mystery schools from esoteric viewpoints, highlighting data traditionally thought to be unimportant, or otherwise understood in an unrelated manner. The primary message is that upright sexuality, exemplified through sexual magic, is the cornerstone upon which all authentic religion, [[yoga]] and [[occultism]] is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=Introduction |quote=Therefore, sexual magic and the Cosmic Christ are the synthesis of all religions, schools and sects. We teach the Doctrine of the Synthesis. This doctrine could never be contrary to the diverse religious forms. Our teachings are found within all religions, schools and  beliefs. If the reader makes a serious study of all the religions of the world, he will discover the phallus and uterus as the synthesis of all Mysteries. |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Perfect Matrimony'' is a discourse on how to transform the sexual energy into its superior aspects via [[Sublimation (psychology)#Sexual  Sublimation|sexual transmutation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=Sexual Yoga |quote=Already the men of science know that the sexual glands are not sealed capsules. They absorb and secret hormones. The hormones of secretion are called "conserving," because they perpetuate the species; the hormones of absorption are called "vitalizing," because they vitalize the human organism. This process of hormonal absorption is transmutation, the transformation of one type of energy-matter into another type of energy-matter. Maithuna, Sexual Magic, is intensified sexual transmutation. The Gnostic absorbs, transmutes and sublimates the totality of the sexual energy-matter. The rich and abundant sexual hormones inundate the circulatory system of the blood and reach the different glands of internal secretion, stimulating and inciting them to work intensely. Thus, with intensified sexual transmutation, the endocrine glands are super-stimulated, producing as is natural a greater number of hormones which animate and modify the entire liquid nervous system. |page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; It states that there are three types of Sexual Magic, or Tantra: Black, Grey, and White. Black Tantra involves the ejaculation of semen, and Grey Tantra sometimes concludes with orgasm or ejaculation, while White Tantra always opposes any loss of sexual energy whatsoever, in other words, without orgasm or ejaculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=Sexual Yoga |quote=Three types of Tantras exist in India; first White Tantra, second, black Tantra, third, grey Tantra. In White Tantra, Sexual Magic is practiced without the spilling of semen. In black Tantra there is spilling of semen. In grey Tantra, the semen is and is not spilled. Sometimes the semen is spilled, and sometimes it is not spilled.

Sexual magic is explained to be the same as [[maithuna]], sexual yoga, urdhvareta yoga.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |pages=253–254 |chapter=Sexual Yoga|quote=In the Hindustan, Sexual Magic is known as Maithuna.

''The Perfect Matrimony'' also states that [[Mary Magdalene#Relationship with Jesus|Jesus was married]] and practiced sexual yoga with his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samael Aun Weor |authorlink=Samael Aun Weor |title=The Perfect Matrimony |origyear=1961 |year=2001 |publisher=Thelema Press |isbn=0-9742755-0-6 |chapter=The Christ|quote=Jesus was a complete man.

==Biography==

Roy was born in 1933 in [[Rajbari District|Rajbari]], [[Rangamati]], [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]], [[British India]].&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; He was the son of Raja Nalinaksha Roy.&lt;ref name=dstar/&gt;

He was installed as the 50th [[Raja]], or hereditary [[King of the Chakma Circle]], on 2 May 1953.&lt;ref name=dstar/&gt;&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Roy abdicated the throne 1971 in favour of his son, [[Raja Devasish Roy]], the current ruler of the [[Chakma people]], during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name=dstar/&gt;&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Roy remained a practicing [[Buddhist]], the predominant faith of the Chakma people, throughout his life.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt;

Despite being heavily non-Muslim, the Chittagong Hill Tracts were awarded to Pakistan (specifically [[East Pakistan]]) by the British during the 1947 [[partition of India]].&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; The Chakmas and other people of the hill tracts had favored union with India instead of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Initially granted special autonomy, the status of the region was changed by the Pakistani government during the 1950s to allow the settlement of large numbers of largely non-indigenous, Muslim Bengali settlers into the region.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; The Pakistani government also opened a hydro-electric dam, the [[Kaptai Dam]] in the early 1960s, which flooded about 40% of the Chakmas' available [[arable land]].&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; However, the Chakmas under Tridev Roy chose to remain neutral during the 1960s and 1970s as relations between the Pakistani Army and [[Mukti Bahini]], which fought for Bangladeshi independence.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt;

In 1970, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the head of the [[Awami League]] and future founder of Bangladesh, asked Roy to run for Parliament as a member of the Awami League.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Roy declined Rahman's offering, choosing instead to run in the [[Politics of Bangladesh#General Election, 1970|1970 general election]] as an independent.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Roy won his election as independent candidate from his constituency in the Chittagong Hill Tracts.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt;

Roy sided with [[Pakistan]] in 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]], which resulted in Bangladesh's independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNyJS9YfbyoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA34&amp;lpg=RA1-PA34&amp;dq=raja+tridiv+roy&amp;source=web&amp;ots=kbiJCqIvai&amp;sig=xDAg8CY-1lPOhyNTr2T1L7Hq3Bg |title=Indigenous peoples and ethnic ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the war and Bangladesh's independence, Roy chose to move from the former [[East Pakistan]] to [[West Pakistan]], where he resided for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mshel.com/book00022.html |title=Books |publisher=Mshel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy feared political persecution if he remained in Bangladesh after the country's independence, which led to his decision to move to Pakistan.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; He also felt that the new Bangladeshi government would no longer guarantee the special autonomous status of the Chittagong Hill Tracts.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; He abdicated as the Raja of the Chakmas in 1971 in favor of his son, [[Raja Debashish Roy]], when he went into exile.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; The government of Pakistan made Roy a lifetime federal minister for his loyalty to the government in Islamabad during the war.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;

Roy headed a delegation from Pakistan to oppose Bangladesh's application to join the United Nations.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; The government of Bangladesh, under Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, sent its own delegation to New York to apply for admission led by Tridev Roy's mother [[Benita Roy|Rajmata Benita Roy]].&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;

Roy joined the government of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] during the 1970s.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Bhutto offered Roy the position of [[President of Pakistan]] once he became [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; However, Roy declined Bhutto's offer of the presidency because, under the new [[Constitution of Pakistan]] of 1973, only Muslims can become President of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Roy, who called the presidency a "gilded cage," was unwilling to convert from Buddhism to Islam to hold the office.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Bhutto was later [[Operation Fair Play|overthrown]] by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] in 1977.

In 1981, Roy was appointed as Pakistani Ambassador to [[Argentina]] by the Zia government, a move which simultaneously removed him from day-to-day involvement in Pakistani politics.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; He was simultaneously accredited as an ambassador in Chile, Ecuador, Peru and Uruguay and he held these positions until 1995. He later was Pakistan's High Commissioner to Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; He remained abroad to abroad until 1996, when he returned to [[Islamabad]].&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; Roy also held the position as a federal minister-for-life within the Pakistani government.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt;

Roy, a leading figure in Pakistan's Buddhist community, headed the Pakistan Buddhist Society from 1996 until his death in 2012.&lt;ref name=etribune/&gt; In 2005, the [[High Commissioner]] of [[Sri Lanka]], General Srilal Weerasooriya, on behalf of the [[President of Sri Lanka|President]], conferred the emblems of the [[Sri Lankan Ranjana National Award]] on Federal Minister Tridev Roy for his work on behalf of Pakistan's Buddhist community.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;

Tridiv Roy died from cardiac arrest at his home in [[Islamabad]] on 17 September 2012, at the age of 79.&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt; He is survived by his wife, Arati Roy, three sons, and two daughters.&lt;ref name=dstar/&gt;

==Legacy==

The ''[[Express Tribune]]'' published an editorial the day following his death titled "The Raja who gave away his kingdom" on the diplomat's political career, excerpts of which are below:&lt;ref name=etribune&gt;{{cite news |first= |last=|title=The Raja who gave away his kingdom |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/438375/the-raja-who-gave-away-his-kingdom/|work=[[The Express Tribune]] |publisher= |date=18 September 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Raja Tridiv Roy, minister-for-life, former government adviser, envoy and chief of the Chakma Tribals, died in Islamabad on Monday. He was 79. The late Raja Roy will be remembered as the man who gave away his kingdom so that he could be with Pakistan during one of the country's most turbulent periods...

A Buddhist by faith, Raja Tridiv Roy, left [[East Pakistan]] and came and joined the government of then president of Pakistan [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in the seventies. This despite the fact that he won the elections in 1971 as an independent candidate from his constituency.
Roy's other distinction was that at one point he was also offered the position of [[President of Pakistan]] by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who himself had assumed the prime ministership of the country...

When Bhutto was deposed in 1977, Raja Tridiv Roy was carted off in 1981 on an ambassadorship to far away Argentina. He returned to Islamabad in 1996. After that, he was head of the Pakistan Buddhist Society.}}

==Books==

Among his books, Tridiv Roy published his memoirs entitled, "The Departed Melody". The book begins with the history and culture of the people of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] and the Chakma Rajas. His other books and publications include "Collection of Short Stories," which was translated to Urdu, and "South American Diary."&lt;ref name=dawn/&gt;

'''Two of Swords''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[tarot]] card.
Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divination usage==

A female figure sits blindfolded, as she calmly balances two swords across her shoulders. Behind her is a large body of water and above her is the moon.

The woman's seated position, in combination with the crescent moon, recalls the [[High Priestess (Tarot card)|High Priestess]] card, and we find a link as well in this card's representation of the characteristic feminine strength of intuition. The woman's blindfold and the sea show a necessity to rely not on immediate stimuli but on deeper thoughts and feelings, that part of the [[unconscious mind]] that we call our higher self.

Her seated position, when conceptually paired with the balanced swords and the blindfold, may also recall the [[Justice (Tarot card)|Justice]] card.  Yet here the concept of justice is not one of retribution, but of making decisions that are balanced, moral and that we trust to be harmonious within and without ourselves.

Unlike the "hoodwinked" woman held captive on the [[Eight of Swords]], this card depicts a woman in control.  The scene and the discipline of her pose do more to suggest that she has placed the blindfold on herself, as is done in many cultures, ritualistically, to encourage reliance on the other senses (for example the use of blindfolds in martial arts).  

The woman is blind in her situation, but she is safe, not only unafraid, but centered. She wields powerful weapons, but they are not held in a position that is threatening to her or anyone else.  The moon and the sea reinforce this sense of calm and equanimity.

This is a card of meditation, not of action. The crossed swords point to different possible directions, but for the moment the character is looking inward rather than outward and in the possession of an awesome power that protects her until she finds the direction to apply it.

[[File:Viewing (museum display).JPG|thumb|Wake (museum display)]]
[[File:現代葬式風景・葬式仏教a.jpg|thumb|170px|Wake ([[Buddhism]] in Japan)]]

A '''wake''' is a social gathering associated with [[death]], usually held before a [[funeral]]. Traditionally, a wake takes place in the house of the deceased with the body present; however, modern wakes are often performed at a [[funeral home]] or another convenient location. In the United States and Canada it is synonymous with a [[viewing (funeral)|viewing]]. It is often a social rite that highlights the idea that the loss is one of a social group and affects that group as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;1991 Metcalf, Peter &amp; Richard Huntington. Celebrations of Death: The Anthropology of Mortuary Ritual. Cambridge Press, New York. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; __NOTOC__

The term originally referred to a late-night prayer [[vigil]] but is now mostly used for the social interactions accompanying a funeral.  While the modern usage of the verb ''wake'' is "become or stay alert", a ''wake'' for the dead harks back to the vigil, "watch" or "guard" of earlier times. It is a misconception that people at a wake are waiting in case the deceased should "wake up".&lt;ref name="Brunetti"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cp0r3aa8EM8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA74,M1] {{cite book |author1=Ivan Brunetti |author2=Wilton, David A. |title=Word myths: debunking linguistic urban legends |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-19-517284-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The term ''wake'' was originally used to denote a prayer vigil, often an annual event held on the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of the saint to whom a [[parish church]] was dedicated.&lt;ref name="Harland"&gt;{{cite book|last=Harland|first=John|authorlink=John Harland|author2=Wilkinson, T. T.|title=Lancashire legends traditions, pageants |publisher=George Routledge and Sons|date=1873|pages=123–124|chapter=Pageants, maskings and mummings|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924028040057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time the association with prayer has become less important, although not lost completely,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lysik|first=David|author2=Gilmour, Peter|title=Now and at the Hour of Our Death: Instructions Concerning My Death and Funeral|publisher=Liturgy Training Publications|date=September 1996|pages=28|isbn=1568542860}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in many countries a wake is now mostly associated with the social interactions accompanying a funeral.&lt;ref name="Brunetti"/&gt;

It used to be the custom in most Celtic countries in Europe for mourners to keep watch or vigil over their dead until they were buried&amp;nbsp;— this was called a "wake". This is still common in Ireland and North-western Scotland.

With the change to the more recent practice of holding the wake at a funeral home rather than the home, the custom of providing refreshment to the mourners is often held directly after the funeral at the house or another convenient location.

The wake or the viewing of the body is a prominent part of death rituals in many cultures. This ceremony allows one last interaction with the corpse, providing a time for the living to express their emotions and beliefs about death with the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoy|first1=William G.|title=Do Funerals Matter? : The Purposes and Practices of Death Rituals in Global Perspective|date=2013|publisher=Taylor and Francis|isbn=9780415662048|page=108|url=https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/miami/reader.action?docID=1143828&amp;query=&amp;ppg=35#|accessdate=February 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
