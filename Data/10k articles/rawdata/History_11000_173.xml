==Biography==
He was born in [[Extremadura]], [[Spain]] in the [[Province of Cáceres]], and he arrived in Mexico, still a child, in 1522, during the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Patricia|last1=Escandón|title=De la Iglesia indiana: Homenaje a Elsa Cecilia Frost|publisher=[[UNAM]]|year=2006|isbn=970-32-4171-9|page=17|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gEcbnHdpEh8C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22Alonso%20de%20Molina%20lleg%C3%B3%20a%20la%20Nueva%20Espa%C3%B1a%20siendo%20todav%C3%ADa%20muy%20ni%C3%B1o%22}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up playing with monolingual Nahuatl-speaking children in the streets as the Aztec capital, [[Tenochtitlan]], was being refashioned into [[Mexico City]] and so he became a fluent speaker of Nahuatl.&lt;ref name="AHLP74"&gt;{{harvnb|Hernández de León-Portilla|2007|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1528, as a young man, he entered the [[Franciscan order|Franciscan]] convent of Mexico City becoming a friar. He taught at the [[Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco|Colegio de Santa Cruz]] in [[Tlatelolco (Mexico City)|Tlatelolco]] along with [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], [[Andrés de Olmos]], Arnaldo de Basaccio, Juan de Gaona, and Maturino Gilberti&lt;ref name="Georges Baudot 1569. p. 114"&gt;Georges Baudot, ''Utopia and History in Mexico: The First Chronicles of Mexican Civilization, 1520-1569.'' Translated by Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano and Thelma Ortiz de Montellano.  Boulder: University of Colorado Press 1995, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Students at the school were also important. [[Juan Badiano]], a student at the school, translated a Nahuatl herbal into Latin.&lt;ref name="Georges Baudot 1569. p. 114"/&gt; Besides his clerical duties, Molina devoted himself to studying, understanding, and writing Nahuatl. He composed and preached many sermons in the language.

==''Vocabulary''==
[[File:Molina dictionary.jpg|thumb|Molina's dictionary.]]
Molina's ''Vocabulary in Castilian and Mexican language'', which he composed between 1555 and 1571, was the first dictionary printed in the [[New World]] and, together with Olmos's work, was the first published systematic approach to an indigenous language. It is still considered an indispensable tool for students of [[Classical Nahuatl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Frances E.|last1=Karttunen|title=An analytical dictionary of Nahuatl|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8061-2421-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4LURGT0h2AC&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=%22Fray%20Alonso%20de%22%20Molina%20%22the%20most%20important%22%20%22reference%20works%20about%20Nahuatl%20in%20existence%22|page=xvii (Introduction)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], "Molina went far beyond utilitarian basics to include a vast range of vocabulary, making many subtle semantic and grammatical distinctions."&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquesy''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Molina's work creating tools for Nahuatl came under scrutiny by the Inquisition  along with those of other Franciscans. In 1574, he attempted to reprint his ''Vocabulary'', an indispensable tool for evangelization in Nahuatl, but the Inquisition compelled him to restate sections of his introduction to the work that it considered to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Baudot, ''Utopia and History in Mexico: The First Chronicles of Mexican Civilization, 1520-1569.'' Translated by Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano and Thelma Ortiz de Montellano.  Boulder: University of Colorado Press 1995, p. 100 citing ''Carta del doctor d. Pedro Moya de Contreras al presidente del Consejo de Indias, Mexico, 24 de marzo de 1574, in F. del Paso y Troncoso, ''Epistolario de Nueva España'', Mexico: 1939-43: vol. 11, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lockhart's analysis of Nahuatl as an index of cultural change relies on Molina's 1555 ''Vocabulary'', which translates Nahuatl (''Mexicana'') to Spanish (''Castellana''), as a key source for loanwords from Spanish into Nahuatl in which he calls Stage 2, the second generation of language contact (ca. 1550 to 1600).&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'' Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992, pp. 284-88&lt;/ref&gt;   Molina records many nouns from Spanish that became integrated into Nahuatl, but his dictionary also records Nahuatl descriptions of Spanish concepts or objects. Lockhart listed some of them, including "bier" = ''miccatlapechtli'' "dead-person platform"; "plow" = ''quaquauhe ielimiquia'' "means by which an ox cultivates"; "justice, the law (''justicia'')" = ''tlamelahuacahihualiztli'' "doing things straight"; "pirate" = ''acalco tenamoyani'' "one who robs people on a boat".&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart, ''Nahuas After the Conquest'', p. 266, Table 7.1 "Early Nahuatl Descriptions of Spanish Introductions and Concepts". p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molina's ''Confessionario'' (1569) includes a model testament, with elements that were standard features of Nahuatl wills: an invocation, the name and the residence of the testator, declarations of the testator being of sound mind, the disposition of property to particular heirs or designation of property to  be sold for masses, and the closing section with named executors (''albaceas'') and witnesses (''testigos'').&lt;ref&gt;Alonso de Molina, ''Confessionario mayor'' ff. 61-63v.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lockhart, ''Nahuas After the Conquest'', Appendix B "Molina's Model Testament", pp. 468-474.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Fray Alonso de Molina's Model Testament and Antecedents to Indigenous Wills in Spanish America" in ''Dead Giveaways: Indigenous Testaments of Colonial Mesoamerica and the Andes'', Susan Kellogg and Matthew Restall, eds.

Greek authors gave him the epithet "Mnemon" ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''mnḗmona'', in [[Old Persian]]: ''abiataka''), meaning "remembering; having a good memory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/artaxerxes-ii-achaemenid-king|title=ARTAXERXES II – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rise to power ==
Darius II died in 404 BC, just before the final victory of the Egyptian general, [[Amyrtaeus]], over the Persians in Egypt.

His successor was his eldest son Arsames who was crowned as Artaxerxes II in [[Pasargadae]].
 
Even before his coronation, Artaxerxes was facing threats to his rule from his younger brother, [[Cyrus the Younger]].
Four years earlier, Cyrus was appointed by his father as the supreme governor of the provinces of Asia Minor. There, he managed to pacify local rebellions and become a popular ruler among both the Iranians and Greeks. Towards the end of 405 BC, Cyrus became aware of his father's illness. By gathering support from the local Greeks and by hiring Greek mercenaries commanded by Clearchus, Cyrus started marching down towards Babylonia, initially declaring his intention to crush the rebellious armies in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Achaemenid Empire|url = http://iranologie.com/the-history-page/the-achaemenid-empire/|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Darius II's death, Cyrus had already been successful in defeating the Syrians and Cilicians and was commanding a large army made up of his initial supporters plus those who had joined him in Phrygia and beyond.

Upon hearing of his father's death, Cyrus the Younger declared his claim to the throne, based on the argument that he was born to Darius and Parysatis after Darius had ascended to the throne, while Artaxerxes was born prior to Darius II gaining the throne .

Artaxerxes defended his position against his brother [[Cyrus the Younger]] who, with the aid of a large army of Greek mercenaries, attempted to usurp the throne. Though Cyrus' mixed army fought to a tactical victory at the [[Battle of Cunaxa]] in Babylon (401 BC), Cyrus himself was killed in the exchange by [[Mithridates (soldier)|Mithridates]], rendering his victory irrelevant. (The Greek historian [[Xenophon]] would later recount this battle in the ''[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]'', focusing on the struggle of the now-stranded Greek mercenaries to return home.)

== Reign ==
[[File:Double daric 330-300 obverse CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|left|240px|[[Daric]] of Artaxerxes II]]
Artaxerxes became involved in a war with Persia's erstwhile allies, the [[Sparta]]ns, who, under [[Agesilaus II]], invaded [[Asia Minor]]. In order to redirect the Spartans' attention to Greek affairs, Artaxerxes subsidized their enemies: in particular the [[Athens|Athenians]], [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]] and [[Corinth]]ians. These subsidies helped to engage the [[Sparta]]ns in what would become known as the [[Corinthian War]]. In 386 BC, Artaxerxes II betrayed his allies and came to an arrangement with Sparta, and in the [[Treaty of Antalcidas]] he forced his erstwhile allies to come to terms. This treaty restored control of the Greek cities of [[Ionia]] and [[Aeolis]] on the Anatolian coast to the Persians, while giving Sparta dominance on the Greek mainland. In 385 BC he [[Artaxerxes' II Cadusian Campaign|campaigned against the Cadusians]].

Although successful against the Greeks, Artaxerxes had more trouble with the [[Egypt]]ians, who had successfully revolted against him at the beginning of his reign.  An attempt to reconquer Egypt in 373 BC was completely unsuccessful, but in his waning years the Persians did manage to defeat a joint Egyptian–Spartan effort to conquer [[Phoenicia]]. He quashed the [[Revolt of the Satraps]] in 372–362 BC.

He is reported to have had a number of wives. His main wife was [[Stateira (wife of Artaxerxes II)|Stateira]], until she was poisoned by Artaxerxes' mother Parysatis in about 400 BC. Another chief wife was a Greek woman of [[Phocaea]] named Aspasia (not the same as the concubine of [[Pericles]]). Artaxerxes II is said to have more than 115 sons from 350 wives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Achaemenid Empire |url=http://iranologie.com/the-history-page/the-achaemenid-empire/ |accessdate=2015-06-21 }}[http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619124220/http://www.iranologie.com/history/Achaemenid/chapter%20V.html |date=2008-06-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification==

The Jewish [[Johanan (High Priest)|high priest Johanan]] is mentioned in the [[Johanan (High Priest)#Archaeology|Elephantine papyri]]&lt;ref&gt;Pritchard, James B. ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, Princeton University Press, third edition with supplement 1969, {{ISBN|9780691035031}}, p. 492&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bezalel Porten (Author), J. J. Farber (Author), C. J. F. Martin (Author), G. Vittmann (Author), The Elephantine Papyri in English (Documenta Et Monumenta Orientis Antiqui, book 22), Koninklijke Brill NV, The Netherlands, 1996, {{ISBN|9781589836280}}, p 125-153.&lt;/ref&gt; dated to 407 BC, i.e., during [[Darius II]]'s reign, and is also mentioned in [[Ezra#Timeline|Ezra]] [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezra+10%3A6&amp;version=KJV 10:6] after the reign of Darius ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+6%3A1&amp;version=KJV Ezra 6:1]) and during the rule of Artaxerxes ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezra+7%3A1&amp;version=KJV Ezra 7:1]), thereby supporting the chronological sequence.

[[Ahasuerus#Historical identification|Amongst others]], it has been suggested that Artaxerxes II was the [[Ahasuerus]] mentioned in the [[Book of Esther]]. [[Plutarch]] in his ''Lives'' (AD 75) records alternative names ''Oarses'' and ''Arsicas'' for [[Artaxerxes II|Artaxerxes II Mnemon]] given by [[Deinon]] (c. 360–340 BC&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Felix, ''Encyclopaedia Iranica'', entry ''Dinon'', 1996–2008&lt;/ref&gt;) and [[Ctesias]] (Artexerxes II's physician&lt;ref&gt;Jona Lendering, ''Ctesias of Cnidus'', Livius, Articles on Ancient History, 1996–2008&lt;/ref&gt;) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;John Dryden, Arthur Hugh Clough, ''Plutarch's Lives'', Little, Brown and Company, 1885&lt;/ref&gt; These derive from the Persian name ''Khshayarsha'' as do "Ahasuerus" ("(Arta)Xerxes") and the [[hypocoristicon]] "Arshu" for Artaxerxes II found on a contemporary inscription (''LBAT'' 162&lt;ref&gt;M. A. Dandamaev, W. J. Vogelsang, ''A Political History of the Achaemenid Empire'', BRILL, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;). These sources thus arguably identify Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II in light of the names used in the Hebrew and Greek sources and accords with the contextual information from Pseudo-Hecataeus and [[Berossus]]&lt;ref name="Hosch"&gt;Jacob Hoschander, ''The Book of Esther in the Light of History'', Oxford University Press, 1923&lt;/ref&gt; as well as agreeing with Al-Tabari and Masudi's placement of events. The 13th century Syriac historian [[Bar-Hebraeus]] in his ''Chronography'', also identifies Ahasuerus as Artaxerxes II citing the sixth century AD historian [[John of Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;E. A. W. Budge, ''The Chronography of Bar Hebraeus'', Gorgias Press LLC, reprinted 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jan Jacob van Ginkel, ''John of Ephesus. A Monophysite Historian in Sixth-century Byzantium'', Groningen, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;
However contrary to Esther 1:1 Artaxerxes II on his accession lost Egypt to pharaoh [[Amyrtaeus]], after which it wasn't part of the Persian empire anymore.

'''B. W. Aston''' (April 27, 1936 – March 25, 2010) was an American historian whose career embraced local and regional history as well as Latin American studies. From 1967 to 2001, he was a faculty member at [[Baptist]]-affiliated [[Hardin-Simmons University]] in [[Abilene, Texas]].

Aston was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] to Ernest Roy Aston and Mural Aston.&lt;ref name=ssdi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi|title=Social Security Death Index|publisher=ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Technical High School in Fort Worth and enrolled briefly at Arlington Junior College in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]], Texas, now part of [[Tarrant County College]].

He served in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1955-58. He entered [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], from which he received the [[Bachelor of Science]] (1962) in education and [[Master of Arts]] (1964) and [[Ph.D.]] (1972) in the field of history.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2010/mar/27/bw-aston/?partner=RSS |title=Dr. B.W.

He was the chairman of the Hardin-Simmons History Department from 1972–92, dean of the College of Liberal Arts from 2000 to 2001, director of the evening college (1972–78), supervisor of the Abilene Photographic Collection (1980–2001), and head of the [[Rupert N. Richardson|Rupert Richardson]] Research Center from 1981 to 2001. A vice president and then president of the faculty, he was named "Faculty Member of the Year" in 1989. He took three periods of [[sabbatical leave]], having conducted research in the [[Dominican Republic]] (1984) and [[Belfast]], [[Northern Ireland]] (2000). In 1993, he taught at [[Massey University]] in New Zealand.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=hsu/&gt;

Aston was affiliated with the [[Texas Folklore Society]] in [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]], the National Popular Culture Society, and the Southwest Council of Latin American Studies, the latter from 1973 until his death. He was also active in the [[West Texas Historical Association]], having served as its secretary-treasurer (1972–98), associate ''Year Book'' editor (1976–98), executive director (1992–98), and life director (1999 until his death).

In 1998, as Aston left the position of WTHA executive director, the association relocated from Hardin-Simmons to Texas Tech and became an integral part of the Southwest Collection.&lt;ref name=hsu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsutx.edu/news%20details.aspx?Channel=%2FChannels%2FContent+Channel&amp;WorkflowItemID=555663dc-220b-4151-8736-b876167d0c3a |title=Former Faculty Member, Historian had Great Impact on the Hardin-Simmons Campus: Dr. B W Aston dies after long illness |publisher=hsutx.edu |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719114935/http://www.hsutx.edu/news%20details.aspx?Channel=%2FChannels%2FContent+Channel&amp;WorkflowItemID=555663dc-220b-4151-8736-b876167d0c3a |archivedate=July 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His dissertation at Texas Tech is entitled ''The Public Career of Don Jose Ives Limantour'', the story of the Mexican politician [[José Yves Limantour|Jose Ives Limantour]], who lived from 1854 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282009-31295001162121/unrestricted/31295001162121.pdf |title=The Public Career of Don Jose Ives Limantour (1972) |publisher=etd.lib.ttu.edu |accessdate=April 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815204132/http://etd.lib.ttu.edu/theses/available/etd-04282009-31295001162121/unrestricted/31295001162121.pdf |archivedate=August 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His professional publications and lectures include ''Limantour and Mexico's Conversion to the Gold Standard'', ''Boom and Bust Along the [[Texas and Pacific Railroad|T&amp;P]]'', ''The Use of Female Imagery In The Selling of World War II'', and ''[[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], Mexico, and the 1994 Gold Rush''.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In 1996, Aston and Ira Donathan "Don" Taylor updated and augmented Rupert Richardson's ''Along Texas Old Fort Trails''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Along-Texas-Forts-Trail-Aston/dp/1574410350|title=''Along the Texas Forts Trail'' (paperback)|publisher=amazon.com|accessdate=April 3, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100220193021/http://www.amazon.com/Along-Texas-Forts-Trail-Aston/dp/1574410350|archivedate=February 20, 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aston traveled throughout the United States, Canada, and to some sixty other countries.&lt;ref name=hsu/&gt;

Aston served on the Landmarks Commission of the [[Taylor County, Texas|Taylor County]] Historical Society and the Abilene Committee for the Humanities. He was active in the University Baptist Church and thereafter the Pioneer Drive Baptist Church, both in Abilene. For some three decades, he was a [[deacon]] and [[Sunday school]] teacher, his last assignment having been the couples class at Pioneer Drive church.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

On August 26, 1961, Aston married the former Lillie Mae Fields (born ca. 1940). Aston died in Abilene of a long illness. He was preceded in death by his parents and a brother, Verlon R. Aston (1925–1999).&lt;ref name=ssdi/&gt; In addition to his wife, he was survived by a brother, Weldon Roy Aston (born ca. 1932) of Fort Worth; three nephews and a niece. Interment services were  held on March 29 at Mount Pleasant Cemetery near [[Tolar, Texas]]. Memorial services were conducted on March 30 at Pioneer Drive church.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

Alan Stafford, former dean of the Cynthia Ann Parker College of Liberal Arts at Hardin-Simmons, described Aston, accordingly:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Dr. Aston was a wonderful Christian gentleman who dearly loved HSU. [An] outstanding professor who touched the lives of thousands of our students, he was an inspiration to several generations of young HSU faculty members. He told me once that he was excited about coming to work every single day. Working with him always inspired me to do my very best, and much of my career success came from observing and learning from his positive approach to teaching, learning, and life in general."&lt;ref name=hsu/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Beda František Dudík''' (29 January 1815, at [[Kojetín]], [[Moravia]] &amp;ndash; 18 January 1890, as abbot and titular bishop at the [[monastery of Raigern]]) was a [[Benedictine]] Moravian historian.

==Life==

After studying at the philosophical school at [[Brno]] he attended the [[University of Olomouc]]. In 1836 he entered the Benedictine Order and in 1840 was ordained priest at [[Rajhrad]]. Then until 1854 he taught first the classical languages and then history at the gymnasium of Brünn.

In 1855 he became ''[[Privatdozent]]'' for historical research at the [[University of Vienna]]; in 1859 he was appointed historiographer of Moravia, and in 1865 was made a member of the Academy of Sciences of Vienna. For purposes of historical research he went in 1851 to Sweden, in 1852 to Rome, in 1870 to France, Belgium, and Holland, in 1874 to Russia, a country which he later repeatedly visited.

Between the years 1853 and 1859 he established at Vienna the main historical library of the [[Teutonic Order]].

==Works==

Dudik was a prolific writer; his works have a lasting value on account of the sources from which he drew. His chief works in chronological order are:

*"Geschichte des Benediktinerstiftes Raigern" (2 vols., Brünn, 1849; 2nd ed., Vienna, 1868); 
*"Mährens Geschichts-quellen" (Brünn, 1850); 
*"Forschungenin Schweden fur Mährens Geschichte" (Brünn, 1852); 
*"Iter Romanum" (2 vols., Vienna, 1855); 
*"Des Herzogtums Troppau ehemalige Stellung zur Markgrafschaft Mähren" (Vienna, 1857); 
*"Waldsteins Korrespondenz" (Vienna, 1865–66); 
*"Waldstein von seiner Enthebung bis zur abermaligen Uebernahme des Armeekommandos" (Vienna, 1858); 
*"Des hohen Deutschen Ritterordens Münzsammlung in Wien" (Vienna, 1858, a special edition with 32 copper plates); 
*"Kleinodien des Deutschen Ritterordens" (Vienna, 1866); 
*"Archive im Konigreich Galizien und Lodomerien" (Vienna, 1867); 
*"Erinnerungen aus dem Feldzug in Italien 1866" (Vienna, 1867); 
*"Preussen in Mähren im Jahre 1742" (Vienna, 1869); 
*"Schweden in Böhmen und Mähren 1640-1660" (Vienna, 1879); 
*"Geschichtliche Entwickelung dor Buchdruckerkunst in Mähren von 1486 bis 1621" (Brünn, 1879).

Dudik's most important publication is: "Mährens allgemeine Geschichte" (12 vols., Brünn, 1860–89); it treats the history of Moravia up to 1350. Volumes VIII-X, which give an account of Moravia during the period of the [[Przemyslian dynasty]], have been translated into Czech. He also published several papers in the transactions of the Academy of Sciences; in vol. LIV appeared: "Korrespondenz Ferdinands II. mit seinen Beichtvätern Becanus and Lamormain".

'''Bruck an der Leitha''' ("[[Bridge]] on the Leitha") is a city in [[Lower Austria]], [[Austria]] at the border to the [[Burgenland]], which is marked by the [[Leitha]] river.

In and around Bruck parts of neolithic tools were found, which makes it likely that there was a settlement there at that time. In Roman time, there was the crossing of two major roads, one of them being the [[Amber Road]], the other a link to the [[Via Militaris]]. The important Roman army camp [[Carnuntum]] was located only ten miles northeast of Bruck at The Amber Road. In Bruck a Roman  fortification is said to have been at the place of "[[Schloss Prugg]]" (castle of Duke [[Harrach]]), of which one part still is named "Roman Tower" (though being built in the Middle Ages).

After the end of the Roman Empire, the first traces of new settlement date from around 900. Graves from this time show Hungarian and later Francian/Bavarian influence. In 1074 the settlement is first documented as "Aschirichesprucca" and elevated to the status of a [[city]] in 1239. During the 13th century Bruck was rebuilt according to a rectangular street-scheme north-east of the old settlement.

Though quite strongly fortified since, Bruck never played an important role in a military conflict. In the long period of wars with the Turkish Empire the fortifications were already outdated, so Bruck did not even try to resist Turkish troops when they approached Vienna in 1529 and 1683 ([[Siege of Vienna]]). Therefore, Bruck was not destroyed (unlike other towns like [[Hainburg an der Donau|Hainburg]]).

After this period, Bruck prospered and became an important center of wine production and trade. In the [[Napoleonic Wars]] Bruck was a center of maneuvers for the Austrian army, which it remained during the 19th century. In 1867 an important permanent military base was erected. After the end of World War I in 1918 the Austro-Hungarian Empire broke up. Most of Bruck belonged to Austria, but the military base and the main railway station was situated on the Hungarian side of the border (this part of Bruck is called [[Bruckneudorf]]).

In 1921, when the western parts of Hungary were integrated to Austrian territory under the name of "Burgenland", Bruck remained divided between the provinces of Lower Austria and Burgenland. Bruck an der Leitha became the capital of the same-named district. Despite the important military base neighbouring Bruck, the town was not much affected by [[World War II]]. Today, Bruck has about 7300 inhabitants and still is the administrative center of the district. Important sights are the city walls from the 13th century, the Baroque church and the old castle, Schloss Prugg, of the Dukes of Harrach.

Today, the town is prospering in the energy department. It has nearby a large [[wind farm]] (possibly 60MW), which generates all the electricity for the town. In fact, the wind farm produces more energy than the town
consumes, so the town profits off it through energy sales.

A '''calendar era''' is the '''year numbering''' system used by a [[calendar]]. For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] numbers its years in the Western [[Christian era]] (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the ''[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as [[Saka Era]].

In antiquity, [[regnal year]]s were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the [[Sumerian King List]] and the Babylonian [[Canon of Kings]]. In East Asia, reckoning by [[era name]]s chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for [[Japan]], where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
{{main|Eponym dating system}}

For over a thousand years, ancient [[Assyria]] used a system of [[Eponym dating system|eponyms]] to identify each year. Each year at the [[Akitu]] festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the ''[[limmu]]'' for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested ''limmu'' eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at [[Kültepe|Karum Kanesh]] in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDLI: The Old and Middle Assyrian limmu officials|url=http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_old_assyrian_limmu_officials|website=Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued in use until the end of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]], ca. 612 BC.

Assyrian scribes compiled ''limmu'' lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the ''limmu'' of Bur-Sagale, governor of [[Tell Halaf|Guzana]]. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as [[Assyrian eclipse|one that took place on 15 June, 763 BC]], which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Alan|title=The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire, 910-612 BC (State Archives of Assyria Studies, Vol. 2)|date=1994|publisher=Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-9514567155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronological debates]] that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], first held in [[776 BC]]. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L. (1999, 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: an exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning'' (corrected printing). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|769}}

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle in Roman Egypt, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., "fifth indiction", "tenth indiction") in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]], and in most parts of Greece until the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in 1453. 

The rule for computing the indiction from the AD year number, which he had just invented, was stated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|770}} Thus 2001 was the ninth indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Almanac Office of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]]. (2000)''[[The Nautical Almanac]] for the year 2001''. [[Washington, DC]]: [[Government Printing Office]] and [[London, England]], UK: [[The Stationery Office]]. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|769–71}}

===Seleucid era===
{{main|Seleucid era}}

The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year [[Seleucus I Nicator]] captured [[Babylon]] and began his reign over the Asian portions of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 [[Tishri]] or on 1 [[Nisan]] (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman '[[Roman consul|consular]]' dating. This involved naming both [[Consul Ordinarius|''consules ordinarii'']] who had taken up this office on January 1 (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|6}} Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as "after the consulate" of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]]. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating, rarely used, was ''[[anno urbis conditae]]'' (Latin: "in the year of the founded city" (abbreviated AUC), where "city" meant Rome). (It is often incorrectly given that AUC stands for ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', which is the title of [[Livy|Titus Livius]]'s history of Rome.)

Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

The system was introduced by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in the 1st century BC. The first day of its year was Founder's Day (April 21), although most modern historians assume that it coincides with the modern historical year (January 1 to December 31). It was rarely used in the [[Roman calendar]] and in the early Julian calendar – naming the two [[consul]]s that held office in a particular year was dominant. AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is thus approximately the same as AUC {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} + 753).

About AD 400, the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] used the AUC era. Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the AUC era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007|reason='although it occurs occasionally in papal documents of the time of John XIII (965-972), it was not the rule before the twelfth century': http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04636c.htm - and that's not even about using abbreviations}}

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Augustus]] indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[Roman legion|legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the [[Roman Empire]] dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The [[Spanish era]] counted the years from 38 BC, probably the date of a new tax imposed by the Roman Republic on the subdued population of Iberia. The date marked the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents in Portugal, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], into the 14th century. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in 1381 and was replaced by today's ''Anno Domini''.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 271 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the [[Decapolis]] and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the [[Pompeian era]], counting dates from the Roman general [[Pompey]]'s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia|Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]].

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from [[Late Antiquity]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]], roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The ''[[Etos Kosmou]]'' of the [[Byzantine Calendar]] places Creation at the beginning of its year 1, namely 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400. The year 7509 of this era began in September 2000.
*The [[Era of Martyrs]] or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month [[Thoth]] (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Church]] and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|766–7}}
*The [[Ethiopian calendar|Incarnation Era]] is used by [[Ethiopia]]. Its epoch is August 29, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The [[Armenian calendar]] has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian "Common Era"====
{{Main|Anno Domini|Common Era}}

The era based on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ]] was introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation being the conception or the [[Nativity of Jesus]] was not drawn until the late ninth century.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|881}} The beginning of the numbered year varied from place to place: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted January 1 as the date the year number changes, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|7}}

* A.D. (or AD) – for the [[Latin]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'', meaning "in the year of (our) Lord". This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. ''[[Anno Salutis]]'', meaning "in the year of salvation" is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of [[Jesus]], according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the medieval [[Julian calendar]], but the first day of the year was either March 1, [[Easter]], March 25, September 1, or December 25, not January 1. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, ''O.S.'' and ''N.S.'' were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on January 1. [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on January 1. Many countries switched to using January 1 as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning "Before Christ". Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year ''n'' BC is ''n'' years before AD 1. Thus there is no [[year zero|year 0]].
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE)  – meaning "[[Common Era]]" and "Before the Common Era", numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, "AD" ''precedes'' the year number, but "CE" ''follows'' the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.)&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press Stylebook''. (2007). New York: Basic Books. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00489-8}}. "Because the full phrase would read ''in the year of the Lord 96'', the abbreviation A.D. goes before the figure for the year: ''A.D. 96.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The  Latin equivalent ''vulgaris aera'' was used as early as 1615  by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of "Vulgar Era" in English. The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
In Latin, "Common Era" is written as ''Vulgaris Aera''. It also occasionally appears as ''æra vulgaris'', ''aera vulgaris'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aera Christiana'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.&lt;/ref&gt; The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century  by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for ''dominus'' "lord" in implicit reference to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Use of "C.E." and "B.C.E.": [[Morris Jacob Raphall]]. ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews'' (1856). 
Explicit use of "b.c.e." for "before the common era": 
Max Stern, ''Lemaʼan Yilmedu: A Second Hebrew Reader for Jewish Schools and Private Instruction'' (1881), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt; John Sumser, ''The Conflict Between Secular and Religious Narratives in the United States: Wittgenstein, Social Construction, and Communication'' (2016), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5SFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69   p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* [[Astronomical year numbering]] equates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The [[Holocene calendar|human era]], also named Holocene era, proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare, E. (1993). [Correspondence]. ''Nature, 336'', 716.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anno Lucis]]'' of [[Freemasonry]] adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*[[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] (or AH) – for the Latinized ''[[Anno Hegirae]]'', meaning "in the year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]", [[Muhammad]]'s flight from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the [[Islamic calendar]]. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely [[lunar calendar]] of about 354 days, its year count increases faster than that of [[solar calendar|solar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}
*[[A.H.S.]] (or AHS){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} is used by the [[Iranian calendar]] to denote the number of ''solar'' years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding January 1 minus 621.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

===Hindu===
*[[Hindu calendar]], counting from the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], with its epoch on February 18, 3102 BC Julian (January 23, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*[[Vikrama Samvat]], 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*[[Saka Era|S.E.]] or (SE) – for the [[Saka|Saka Era]], used in some [[Hindu calendar]]s and in the [[Indian national calendar]], with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian [[Greater India|indianized kingdom]]s.
*[[Buddhist calendar|B.E.]] – for the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]], introduced by [[Vajiravudh]] in 1912, which has an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]], but year 0 in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912 New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941 Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*'''BE''' for Burmese Era – from [[Burmese calendar]] originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived '''CS''' for [[Chula Sakarat]] era; variously known as '''LE''' Lesser Era; '''ME''' Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the [[Saka Era]] of the [[Indian national calendar]]
:B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar is below.

===Bahá'í===
*[[Bahai calendar|B.E.]] – The [[Bahá'í calendar]] dates from the year of the declaration of the [[Báb]]. Years are counted in the Bahá'í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from March 21, 1844.

===Jewish===
*[[Anno Mundi|A.M.]] (or AM) – for the Latin ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', meaning "in the year of the world", has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]] in 1178 by [[Maimonides]]. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the [[Seder Olam Rabba]] of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM).

===Zoroastrian===
*The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used regnal years since the reform by [[Ardeshir I]], but after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]], the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, [[Yazdegerd III of Persia]], crowned June 16, 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated [[Yazdegerd era|Y.Z.]] or "Yazdegerd era".

*The Republican Era of the [[French Republican Calendar]] was dated from September 22, 1792, the day of the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. It was used in Revolutionary France from October 24, 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to December 31, 1805.
*The [[Positivist calendar]] of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The [[Minguo calendar|Republican era]] is used by the [[Republic of China]] since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the [[Juche#Calendar|Juche era]] used in [[North Korea]], the year of the birth of its founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* The [[Era Fascista]] 'Fascist Era' was instituted by the [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] and used [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the [[March on Rome]] in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (''era fascista''). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on July 25, 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the [[Common era]] was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on October 29, so, for example, October 27, 1933 was XI E.F. but October 30, 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see [[Chinese era name]]. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the [[Chinese calendar]], but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see [[Chinese calendar#Beginnings|Chinese calendar]]). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via ''[[Dangun#Dating|Dangi]]'' years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The [[Assyrian calendar]], introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The [[Japanese calendar]] dates from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan]]. The current emperor took the throne in early 1989, which became Heisei 1, which was until then Shōwa 64 (for its first seven days).
*The [[United States]] government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence]], fixed on July 4, 1776, together with the ''Anno Domini'' civil calendar. For instance, its [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] is dated "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential proclamations]] are also dated in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ The White House: Presidential Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
*[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health#Role in Scientology|A.D.]] – "After [[Dianetics]]". In [[Scientology]], years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="LATcostly"&gt;Sappell, J., &amp; Welkos, R. W. (1990, June 28). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,0,6570814.story Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers]. ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discordian calendar|Y.O.L.D.]] – In the [[Discordian calendar]], the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of [[Eris (mythology)|Our Lady of Discord]]). The calendar begins counting from January 1, 1166 BC in the [[Discordian]] year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the [[Greyface|Curse of Greyface]]. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on [[attention deficit disorder]]).
*e.v. – ''Era vulgaris''. (From Latin, meaning "common era", usually stylized in lowercase.) The [[Thelemic]] calendar is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since [[Aleister Crowley]]'s inauguration of the so-called [[Aeon_(Thelema)#Aeon_of_Horus|Aeon of Horus]], which occurred on March 20, 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation "A.N.", for ''Aerae Novae'' ("New Era" in Latin), is sometimes also used.

===Practical===
*[[Before Present|B.P.]] – for [[Before Present]], specifically, the number of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] years before 1950.
*[[Human Era|HE]] – for counting elapsed years of the [[Holocene]] from near the beginning of the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the [[Holocene epoch]], specifically by adding exactly 10,000 years to AD (Anno Domini) or CE (Common Era) years, and subtracting BC/BCE years from 10001.
*[[Julian day number]] – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]. This equals November 24, 4714 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the [[Julian calendar]]. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is {{#expr:({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}-0.5) round 0}}.
* [[Unix time]] – for counting elapsed seconds since the [[Unix epoch]] set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of January 1, 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

'''Carinate''' is a shape in [[pottery]], [[glassware]] and artistic design usually applied to [[amphorae]] or vases. The shape is defined by the joining of a rounded base to the sides of an inward sloping vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Cooper. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; This design is seen in ancient cultures such as recovered in [[archaeological]] digs in such sites as the palace of [[Knossos]] in [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. 2007&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative adjectival form of this design is '''carinated'''.

[[File:Warren Cup BM GR 1999.4-26.1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|Warren Cup, depicting sexual intimacy between a young man or a "[[pederasty|pederast]]" – in the broadest sense – and his "catamite"]]
[[File:Roman Empire Ganymede.jpg|thumb|Roman Ganymede as a ''puer delicatus'', with the eagle of [[Jove]]]]

In [[ancient Greece]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome|Rome]], a '''catamite''' ([[Latin]] ''catamitus'') was a [[pubescent]] boy who was the intimate companion of a young man, usually in a [[pederasty in ancient Rome|pederastic relationship]] – in the broadest sense.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), pp. 52–55, 75.&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually a term of affection and literally means "[[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]" in Latin, and was also used as a term of insult when directed toward a grown man.&lt;ref name="Cicero p. 95"/&gt; The word derives from the [[proper noun]] ''Catamitus'', the [[Latinisation of names|Latinized]] form of ''[[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]'', the name of the beautiful [[Troy|Trojan]] youth abducted by [[Zeus]] to be his companion and cupbearer, according to Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Alastair J. L. Blanshard, "Greek Love," in ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'' (Wiley-Blackwell, 2010), p. 131. Both [[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.128, and [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] state clearly that ''Catamitus'' was the Latin equivalent of ''Ganymedes''; Festus says he was the ''concubinus'' of Jove. Alessandra Bertocchi and Mirka Maraldi, "''Menaechmus quidam:'' Indefinites and Proper Nouns in Classical and Late Latin," in ''Latin vulgaire–Latin tardif. Actes du VII&lt;sup&gt;ème&lt;/sup&gt; Colloque international sur le latin vulgaire et tardif. Séville, 2–6 septembre 2003'' (University of Seville, 2006), p. 95, note 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] form of the name was ''Catmite'', from an alternative Greek form of the name, ''Gadymedes''.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante and Judith Swaddling, ''Etruscan Myths'' (University of Texas Press, 2006), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its modern usage the term '''catamite''' refers to a boy as the passive or receiving partner in anal intercourse with a man.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' 3rd Ed. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in literature==
*In [[Plato]]'s dialogue ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'' (at 494d) [[Socrates]] uses the term in a conversation with Callicles contrasting appetites and contentment.
*The word appears widely but not necessarily frequently in the [[Latin literature]] of antiquity, from [[Plautus]] to [[Ausonius]]. It is sometimes a synonym for ''[[puer delicatus]]'', "delicate boy". [[Cicero]] uses the term as an insult.&lt;ref name="Cicero p. 95"&gt;Cicero, frg. B29 of his orations and ''[[Philippicae|Philippics]]'' 2.77; Bertocchi and Maraldi, "''Menaechmus quidam''," p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; The word became a general term for a boy groomed for sexual purposes.

*[[Stephen Dedalus]] ponders the word in ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' when discussing accusations that [[William Shakespeare]] might have been a pederast.
*[[C. S. Lewis]] in his partial autobiography ''[[Surprised by Joy]]'' described the social roles during his time at Wyvern College (by which he meant [[Malvern College]]) as including the role of "Tart": "a pretty and effeminate-looking small boy who acts as a catamite to one or more of his seniors..." and noted that "[[pederasty]]...was not [frowned upon as seriously as] wearing one's coat unbuttoned." &lt;ref&gt;''Surprised by Joy: The Shape of My Early Life'', Chapter VI ''Bloodery'', pp.83-84, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2961">'''Charles Hilliard Feinstein''' (18 March 1932 – 27 November 2004) was a noted South African and British economic historian. He was born in [[Johannesburg]], received his early education at [[Parktown Boys' High School]] and studied at [[Witwatersrand University]] and [[Cambridge University]] where he completed his doctorate. In 1958, he joined the Department of Applied Economics at Cambridge. During this period, other notable economic historians such as [[Phyllis Deane]] and [[W. A. Cole]] were hard at work, extending data series on the UK economy back into previous centuries. In 1972, Feinstein published his magnum opus ''[[National Income, Expenditure and Output of the United Kingdom, 1855-1965]]'' which has since come to be seen as the standard reference work on UK economic data for the period. The Times said of this book: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Although Feinstein undertook many more investigations, this was perhaps his crowning achievement. Of the several similar projects undertaken in different countries, for example the American, Canadian, Australian and German initiatives, it is fair to say that the one that Feinstein brought into being was the most elegantly reasoned, organised and presented. It was all the more remarkable for being the work largely of one man.''&lt;ref&gt;"Professor Charles Feinstein: Scholar whose work traced the form of the British economy from the 20th back to the 18th century", ''The Times'', December 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A fellow of [[Clare College, Cambridge]], Feinstein was also associated with the universities of York, Harvard, Oxford and Cape Town in the course of a distinguished academic career. He was Chichele Professor of Economic History at All Souls College, Oxford for many years, and was instrumental in the creation of the Oxford Masters (MSc and MPhil) in Social and Economic History. The Feinstein Prize, endowed in his honour, is awarded each year to the student on these courses who writes the best thesis.

He is also the author of an excellent history of South Africa: "An economic history of South Africa: Conquest, discrimination and development"

{{nihongo|'''Chōkyō'''|長享|}} was a [[Japanese era name]] (年号, ''nengō'', "year name") after ''[[Bunmei]]'' and before ''[[Entoku]]''. This period spanned the years from July 1487 through August 1489.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Chōkyō''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 121;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt; The reigning emperor was [[Emperor Go-Tsuchimikado of Japan|Go-Tsuchimikado]]''-tennō'' (後土御門天皇).&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac.

At a value of $75,000 U.S., the Grand Prize is claimed to be the [[List of the world's richest literary prizes|richest non-fiction historical literature prize in the world]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/books/story/2008/04/18/cundill-lit-prize.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mgaz2010/&gt; In addition, two "Recognition of Excellence" prizes of $10,000 U.S. each are awarded.&lt;ref name=mgaz2010/&gt; The winners of the Prizes are selected by an independent jury of at least five internationally qualified individuals selected by [[McGill University]]. The Cundill Prize in History at McGill is administered by McGill University's Dean of Arts, with the help of the [https://mcgill.ca/misc McGill Institute for the Study of Canada] (MISC).&lt;ref name=mgaz2010/&gt;

When the Prize was announced in April 2008, Mr. Cundill noted that he "… was surprised to learn there were no major prizes in history." He explained his affinity to history: "I am an investment researcher of finance and I think there is an analogy between the two disciplines – both study the past to understand the present and predict the future."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mcgill.ca/newsroom/news/item/?item_id=100163]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyber resilience''' refers to an entity's ability to continuously deliver the intended outcome despite adverse cyber events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
| url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-16486-1_31

| access-date = 2016-02-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyber resilience is an evolving perspective that is rapidly gaining recognition. The concept essentially brings the areas of [[information security]], business continuity and (organizational) resilience together.

Entities with potential need of cyber resilience abilities include, but is not limited to; IT systems, critical infrastructure, business processes, organizations, societies and nation-states. Adverse cyber events are those that negatively impact the availability, integrity or confidentiality of networked IT systems and associated information and services. These events may be intentional (e.g. [[cyber attack]]) or unintentional (e.g. failed software update) and caused by humans or nature or a combination thereof.

The objective of cyber resilience is to maintain the entity´s ability to deliver the intended outcome continuously at all times. This means even when regular delivery mechanisms have failed, such as during a crisis and after a security breach. The concept also includes the ability to restore regular delivery mechanisms after such events as well as the ability to continuously change or modify these delivery mechanisms if needed in the face of new risks. [[Backup]]s and [[disaster recovery]] operations are part of the process of restoring delivery mechanisms.

== Frameworks ==
Resilience, as defined by Presidential Policy Directive PPD-21, is the ability to prepare for and adapt to changing conditions and withstand and recover rapidly from disruptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber resilience focuses on the preventative, detective, and reactive controls in an information technology environment to assess gaps and drive enhancements to the overall security posture of the entity. The [[Cyber Resilience Review|Cyber Resilience Review (CRR)]]  is one framework for the assessment of an entity's resiliency created by the [[Department of Homeland Security]]. Another framework created by [[Symantec]] is based on 5 pillars: Prepare/Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/white_papers/b-cyber-resilience-blueprint-wp-0814.pdf

In particular 800-160 identifies fourteen techniques that can be used to improve resiliency:

!Technique
!Purpose
|-
|Adaptive Response
|Optimize the ability to respond in a timely and appropriate manner.
|-
|Analytic Monitoring
|Monitor and detect adverse actions and conditions in a timely and actionable manner.
|-
|Coordinated Protection
|Implement a defense-in-depth strategy, so that adversaries have to overcome multiple obstacles.
|-
|Deception
|Mislead, confuse, hide critical assets from, or expose covertly tainted assets to, the adversary.
|-
|Diversity
|Use heterogeneity to minimize common mode failures, particularly attacks exploiting common vulnerabilities.
|-
|Dynamic Positioning
|Increase the ability to rapidly recover from a non-adversarial incident (e.g., acts of nature) by distributing and diversifying the network distribution.
|-
|Dynamic Representation
|Keep representation of the network current. Enhance understanding of dependencies among cyber and non-cyber resources. Reveal patterns or trends in adversary behavior. 
|-
|Non-Persistence
|Generate and retain resources as needed or for a limited time. Reduce exposure to corruption, modification, or compromise.
|-
|Privilege Restriction
|Restrict privileges based on attributes of users and system elements as well as on environmental factors.
|-
|Realignment
|Minimize the connections between mission-critical and noncritical services, thus reducing the likelihood that a failure of noncritical services will impact mission-critical services.
|-
|Redundancy
|Provide multiple protected instances of critical resources.
|-
|Segmentation
|Define and separate system elements based on criticality and trustworthiness.
|-
|Substantiated Integrity
|Ascertain whether critical system elements have been corrupted.
|-
|Unpredictability
|Make changes randomly and unexpectedly. Increase an adversary’s uncertainty regarding the system protections which they may encounter, thus making it more difficult for them to ascertain the appropriate course of action.

== Difference from cyber security ==
[[Cyber security]] consists of technologies, processes and measures that are designed to protect systems, networks and data from cyber crimes. Effective cyber security reduces the risk of a cyber attack and protects entities, organisations and individuals from the deliberate exploitation of systems, networks and technologies. Cyber resilience looks at a wider scope where it comprises cyber security and business resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cyber-resilience|title=Cyber Resilience|website=www.itgovernance.co.uk|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber security is effective without compromising the usability of  systems and there is a robust continuity business plan to resume operations, if the cyber attack is successful.

Cyber resilience helps businesses to recognize that hackers have the advantage of innovative tools, element of surprise, target and can be successful in their attempt. This concept helps business to prepare, prevent, respond and successfully recover to the intended secure state. This is a cultural shift as the organization sees security as a full-time job and embedded security best practices in day-to-day operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/06/06/cybersecurity-is-dead/#3d1ad0c40121|title=Cybersecurity Is Dead|last=Council|first=Editors, Forbes Technology|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to cyber security, cyber resilience requires the business to think differently and be more agile on handling attacks.

The region of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] is known to have been inhabited since [[Paleolithic]] times.

==Еarliest historical inhabitants==

However, the earliest historical inhabitants of the region were the [[Bryges]], [[Paionians]], [[Thracians]] and [[Illyrians]]. The Bryges occupied northern [[Epirus]],&lt;ref name=IESE&gt;{{cite book | first= Iorwerth Eiddon Stephen | last= Edwards | title= The Cambridge Ancient History, Part 2, The Middle East and the Aegean Region c.1380-1000 BC | publisher= Cambridge University Press | location= Cambridge, United Kingdom | year= 1973 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=n1TmVvMwmo4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA709&amp;dq=Brygi++Albania&amp;sig=O6XA9tuWVjwbcO4WQfuSVnYAAY4#PRA1-PA709,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], mainly west of the [[Axios River|Axios]] river and parts of [[Mygdonia]]. Thracians in early times occupied mainly the eastern parts of Macedonia ([[Mygdonia]], [[Crestonia]], [[Bisaltia]]) but were also present in [[Eordaea]] and [[Pieria (regional unit)|Pieria]]. Illyrians once occupied many parts of west Macedonia. At one time all [[Emathia]], Pieria and [[Pelagonia]] were subject to the Paionians. They occupied the entire valley of the [[Axios]]. The [[Ancient Macedonians]] are missing from early historical accounts because they had been living in the southern extremities of the region – the [[Orestis (region)|Orestian highlands]] – since before the [[Greek Dark Ages|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Borza|1992|p=84}}: "The Macedonians themselves may have originated from the same population pool that produced other Greek peoples."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vanderpool|1982|loc=Eugene N. Borza, "Athenians, Macedonians, and the Origins of the Macedonian Royal House", p. 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonian tribes subsequently moved down from Orestis in the upper Haliacmon due to pressure from the [[Orestae]].&lt;ref&gt;On pages 433-434 of "The Position of the Macedonian Dialect", A. Panayotou describes the geographical delimitations of ancient Macedon as encompassing the region from Mount Pindus to the Nestos River, and from Thessaly to Paeonia (the area occupied by the kingdom of Philip II, corresponding in most respects with the Roman province of the same name).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient Macedonians ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

{{Main|Ancient Macedonians}}
{{further|History of Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|List of ancient Macedonians}}
The name of the region of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]] ({{lang-el|Μακεδονία}}, ''Makedonia'') derives from the tribal name of the ancient Macedonians ({{lang-el|Μακεδώνες}}, ''Makedónes''). According to the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] historian [[Herodotus]], the ''Makednoi'' ({{lang-el|Mακεδνοί}}) were a Dorian tribe that stayed behind during the great southward migration of the [[Dorian Greeks]] (Histories 1.56.1).  The word "Makednos" is cognate with the [[Doric Greek]] word "Μάκος" ''Μakos'' ([[Attic Greek|Attic]] form Μήκος – "mékos"), which is [[Greek language|Greek]] for "length".  The ancient Macedonians took this name either because they were physically tall, or because they settled in the mountains. The latter definition would translate "Macedonian" as "Highlander".
[[File:ExpansionOfMacedon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Expansion of Macedon]]
Most academics take the view that the ancient Macedonians probably spoke either a language that was a member of the North-Western Greek dialect group (related to Doric and [[Aeolic]]), or a language very closely related to Greek which would form a Graeco-Macedonian or Hellenic branch; others such as Eugene Borza reach the conclusion that there is insufficient evidence on which to base a conclusion as to whether the original language of the Macedonians was a form of Greek or not, but that the Macedonians were most likely of proto-Greek stock. The controversy over whether the Macedonians were originally Greek or not is caused mainly by contradictory ancient accounts, but also due to the peculiar features of a few Macedonian words, though most words are consistent with Greek (see ''[[Ancient Macedonian language]]''). Some scholars view the [[Pella katadesmos]], written in a form of [[Doric Greek]], as the first discovered Macedonian text. The vast majority of Macedonian names on inscriptions and coinage are Greek and conform to the Doric Greek dialect morphology.  In any case, they are universally considered Hellenes after the reign of [[Alexander the Great]].

Before the reign of [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander I]], father of [[Perdiccas II of Macedon|Perdiccas II]], the ancient Macedonians lived mostly on lands adjacent to the [[Haliakmon]], in the far south of the modern Greek [[Macedonia (region)|province of Macedonia]]. Alexander is credited with having added to Macedonia many of the lands that would become part of the core Macedonian territory: Pieria, [[Bottiaia]], Mygdonia, and Eordaia (Thuc. 2.99). Anthemus, Crestonia, and Bisaltia also seem to have been added during his reign (Thuc. 2.99). Most of these lands were previously inhabited by Thracian tribes, and Thucydides records how the Thracians were pushed to the mountains when the Macedonians acquired their lands.

Generations after Alexander, [[Philip II of Macedon]] would add new lands to Macedonia, and also reduce neighboring powers such as the Illyrians and Paeonians, who had attacked him when he became king, to semi-autonomous peoples. In Philip's time, Macedonians expanded and settled in many of the new adjoining territories, and Thrace up to the [[Nestus]] was colonized by Macedonian settlers. [[Strabo]] however testifies that the bulk of the population inhabiting in Upper Macedonia remained of [[Thraco-Illyrian]] stock. Philip's son, Alexander the Great, extended Macedonian power over key Greek city-states, and his campaigns, both local and abroad, would make the Macedonian power supreme from Greece, to [[Persian Empire|Persia]], [[Egypt]], and the edge of [[India]].

Following this period there ware repeated barbaric invasions of the Balkans by [[Celt]]s.

== Roman Macedonia ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

{{main|Macedonia (Roman province)}}
[[File:Map Macedonia province.png|250px|thumb|Macedonia province within the Roman Empire, c. 120.]]
After the defeat of [[Andriscus]] in 148 BC, Macedonia officially became a province of the [[Roman Republic]] in 146 BC. Hellenization of the non-Greek population was not yet complete in 146 BC, and many of the Thracian and Illyrian tribes had preserved their languages. It is also possible that the ancient Macedonian tongue was still spoken, alongside [[Koine Greek|Koine]], the common Greek language of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] era. From an early period, the Roman province of Macedonia included [[Epirus]], [[Thessaly]], parts of Thrace and [[Illyria]], thus making the region of Macedonia permanently lose connection to its ancient borders, and now including various inhabitants.

== Byzantine Macedonia ==

{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

As the Greek state of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] gradually emerged as a successor state to the [[Roman Empire]], Macedonia became one of its most important provinces as it was close to the Empire's capital ([[Constantinople]]) and included its second largest city ([[Thessaloniki]]). According to Byzantine maps that were recorded by Ernest Honigmann, by the 6th century AD there were two provinces carrying the name "Macedonia" in the Empire's borders{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}:

*Macedonia A
: which corresponded to the geographical borders of ancient Macedon (approximately equivalent to today's [[Greek Macedonia]]);
*Macedonia B
: which corresponded to former barbaric regions that were included in Macedonia during Hellenistic and Roman times (approximately equivalent to parts of today's Southern [[Republic of Macedonia]], Eastern [[Albania]] and Western [[Bulgaria]]).

Macedonia was ravaged several times in the 4th and the 5th century by desolating onslaughts of [[Visigoths]], [[Huns]] and [[Vandals]]. These did little to change its ethnic composition (the region being almost completely populated by Greeks or [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] people by that time) but left much of the region depopulated.

Later in about 800 AD, a new province of the Byzantine Empire – [[Macedonia (theme)|Macedonia]], was organised by [[Empress Irene]] out of the Theme of Thrace. It had no relation with the historical or geographical region of Macedonia, but instead it was centered in [[Thrace]], including the area from [[Adrianople]] (the theme's capital) and the [[Evros Prefecture|Evros]] valley eastward along the [[Sea of Marmara]]. It did not include any part of ancient [[Macedon]], which (insofar as the Byzantines controlled it) was in the Theme of Thessalonica.

The [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] took advantage of the desolation left by the nomadic tribes and in the 6th century settled the Balkan Peninsula ''(See also: [[South Slavs]])''. Aided by the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]] and the [[Bulgars]], the Slavic tribes started in the 6th century a gradual invasion into the lands of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]]. They invaded Macedonia and reached as far south as Thessaly and the [[Peloponnese]], settling in isolated regions that were called by the Byzantines ''Sclavinias'', until they were gradually pacified. Many Slavs came to serve as soldiers in Byzantine armies and settled in other parts of the empire. Many among the Romanised and Hellenised Paeonian, Illyrian and Thracian population of Macedonia were assimilated by the Slavs, but pockets of tribes that fled to the mountains remained independent.&lt;ref&gt;The Ancient Illyrians. Pashko Gjonaij. 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scholars today consider that present-day [[Aromanians]] (Vlachs), [[Sarakatsani]] and [[Albanians]] originate from these mountainous populations. The interaction between Romanised and non-Romanised indigenous peoples and the Slavs resulted in linguistic similarities which are reflected in modern [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], all of them members of the [[Balkan language area]]. The Slavs also occupied the hinterland of Thessaloniki launching consecutive attacks on the city in 584, 586, 609, 620, and 622 AD, however never taking it. The Slavs were often joined in their onslaughts by detachments of [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], but the Avars did not form any lasting settlements in the region. A branch of the Bulgars led by khan [[Kuber]], however, settled western Macedonia and eastern Albania around 680 AD and also engaged in attacks on [[Byzantium]] together with the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. By this time, the whole Macedonia region was inhabited by several different ethnicities, with South Slavs being the overall majority in the northern fringes of Macedonia &lt;ref&gt;The Balkans: From Communism to Constantinople. Dennis P Hupchik&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Macedonia |volume=17 |pages=216–222 |first=James David |last=Bourchier }}&lt;/ref&gt; while Greeks dominated the highlands of western Macedonia, the central plains, and the coastline.

At the beginning of the 9th century, Bulgaria conquered Northern Byzantine lands, including Macedonia B and part of Macedonia A. Those regions remained under Bulgarian rule for two centuries, until the destruction of Bulgaria by the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil II]] (nicknamed the Bulgar-slayer) in 1018.
In the 11th and the 12th century, the first mention is made of two ethnic groups just off the borders of Macedonia: the [[Arvanites]] in modern Albania and the Vlachs (Aromanians) in Thessaly and Pindus. Modern historians are divided as to whether the Albanians came to the area then (from [[Dacia]] or Moesia) or originated from the native non-Romanized Thracian or Illyrian populations.

Also in the 11th century Byzantium settled several tens of thousand Turkic Christians from [[Asia Minor]], referred to as [[Vardariotai|Vardariotes]], along the lower course of the Vardar. Colonies of other Turkic tribes such as Uzes, Petchenegs, and Cumans were also introduced at various periods from the 11th to the 13th century. All these were eventually Hellenized or Bulgarized. [[Romani people|Romani]], migrating from north India reached the Balkans, including Macedonia, around the 14th century with some of them settling there. There were successive waves of Romani immigration in the 15th and the 16th century, too. ''(See also: [[Roma in the Republic of Macedonia]])''

In the 13th and the 14th century, Macedonia was contested by the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Despotate of Epirus]], the rulers of [[Thessaly]], and the [[Bulgarian Empire]], but the frequent shift of borders did not result in any major population changes. In 1338, it was conquered by the [[Serbian Empire]], but after the [[Battle of Maritsa]] in 1371 most of the Serbian lords of Macedonia acknowledged [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] suzerainty. After the conquest of [[Skopje]] by the Ottoman Turks in 1392, most of Macedonia was formally incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]].

The initial period of Ottoman rule led a depopulation of the plains and river valleys of Macedonia. The Christian population there fled to the mountains. Ottomans were largely brought from Asia Minor and settled parts of the region. Towns destroyed in [[Vardar Macedonia]] during the conquest were renewed, this time populated exclusively by Muslims. The Ottoman element in Macedonia was especially strong in the 17th and the 18th century with travellers defining the majority of the population, especially the urban one, as Muslim. The Ottoman population, however, sharply declined at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century on account of the incessant wars led by the Ottoman Empire, the low birth rate and the higher death toll of the frequent plague epidemics among Muslims than among Christians.

The [[Great Turkish War|Ottoman–Habsburg War]] (1683–1699), the subsequent flight of a substantial part of the Serbian population in [[Kosovo]] to [[Austria]] and the reprisals and looting during the Ottoman counteroffensive led to an influx of Albanian Muslims into Kosovo, northern and northwestern Macedonia. Being in the position of power, the Albanian Muslims managed to push out their Christian neighbours and conquered additional territories in the 18th and the 19th centuries. Pressures from central government following the first Russo-Turkish war that ended in 1774 and in which Ottoman Greeks were implicated as a "fifth column" led to the  a superficial islamization of several thousand Greek-speakers in western Macedonia. These [[Greek Muslims]] retained their Greek language and identity, remained [[Crypto-Christians]], and were subsequently called [[Vallahades]] by local Greek Orthodox Christians because apparently the only Turkish-Arabic they ever bothered to learn was how to say "wa-llahi" or "by Allah".&lt;ref&gt;See Vakalopoulos, 'A History of Macedonia, 1354–1832', Salonika, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction and abandoning of the Christian Aromanian city of [[Moscopole]] and other important Aromanian settlements in the southern Albania (Epirus-Macedonia) region in the second half of the 18th century caused a large-scale migration of thousands of Aromanians to the cities and villages of Western Macedonia, most notably to [[Bitola]], [[Krushevo]] and surrounding regions. Thessaloniki also became the home of a large Jewish population following Spain's expulsions of Jews after 1492. The Jews later formed small colonies in other Macedonian cities, most notably Bitola and [[Serres, Greece|Serres]].

The rise of European nationalism in the 18th century led to the expansion of the [[Greece|Hellenic]] idea in Macedonia. Its main pillar throughout the centuries of Ottoman rule had been the indigenous [[Greek Macedonians|Greek population]] of historical Macedonia. Under the influence of the Greek schools and the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]], however, it started to spread among the other orthodox subjects of the Empire as the urban Christian population of Slavic and Albanian origin started to view itself increasingly as Greek. The [[Greek language]] became a symbol of civilization and a basic means of communication between non-Muslims. The process of Hellenization was additionally reinforced after the abolition of the [[Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid]] in 1767. Though with a predominantly Greek clergy, the Archbishopric did not yield to the direct order of Constantinople and had autonomy in many vital domains. However, the poverty of the Christian peasantry and the lack of proper schooling in villages preserved the linguistic diversity of the Macedonian countryside. The Hellenic idea reached its peak during the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1821–1829) which received the active support of the [[Greek Macedonians|Greek Macedonian]] population as part of their struggle for the resurrection of Greek statehood. According to the ''Istituto Geografiko de Agostini'' of Rome, in 1903 in the [[vilayet]]s of Selanik and Monastir Greek was the dominant language of instruction in the region:&lt;ref&gt;Foundation of the Hellenic World.

The independence of the Greek kingdom, however, dealt a nearly fatal blow to the Hellenic idea in Macedonia. The flight of the Macedonian intelligentsia to independent Greece and the mass closures of Greek schools by the Ottoman authorities weakened the Hellenic presence in the region for a century ahead, until the incorporation of historical Macedonia into Greece following the Balkan Wars in 1913.

=== Bulgarian idea ===
[[File:Europe ethnic map 1897 (hungarian).jpg|mini|right|300px|thumb|Ethographic map of Europe in 1897 from a Hungarian historian.]]
[[File:Ethnic map of Balkans - german 1882.jpg|left|300px|thumb|Map from the German geographer [[Heinrich Kiepert]] created in 1882.]]
[[File:Balkans-ethnic (1861).jpg|thumb|Ethnic composition map of the Balkans by the French ethnographer [[Guillaume Lejean]] (1861)]]

Most of the population of Macedonia were described as Bulgarians during 16th and 17th centuries by Ottoman historians and travellers such as [[Hoca Sadeddin Efendi]], [[Mustafa Selaniki]], [[Hadji Khalfa]] and [[Evliya Celebi]]. The name meant, however, rather little in view of the political oppression by the [[Ottomans]] and the religious and cultural one by the Greek clergy. The Bulgarian language was preserved as a cultural medium only in a handful of monasteries, and to rise in terms of social status for the ordinary Bulgarian usually meant undergoing a process of [[Hellenisation]]. The Slavonic liturgy was, however, preserved at the lower levels of the [[Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid]] for several centuries until its abolition in 1767.

The creator of modern Bulgarian historiography, [[Petar Bogdan Bakshev]] in his first work "''Description of the Bulgarian Kingdom''" in 1640, mentioned the geographical and ethnic borders of Bulgaria and Bulgarian people including also "''the greather part of Macedonia ... as far as Ohrid, up to the boundaries of Albania and Greece ...''". [[Hristofor Zhefarovich]], a Macedonia-born 18th-century painter, had a crucial influence on the [[Bulgarian National Revival]] and significantly affected the entire Bulgarian [[heraldry]] of the 19th century, when it became most influential among all generations of Bulgarian enlighteners and revolutionaries and shaped the idea for a modern Bulgarian national symbol. In his testament, he explicitly noted that his relatives were "of Bulgarian nationality" and from [[Dojran]].
Although the first literary work in Modern Bulgarian, [[Istoriya Slavyanobolgarskaya|History of Slav-Bulgarians]] was written by a Macedonia born Bulgarian monk, [[Paisius of Hilendar]] as early as 1762, it took almost a century for the Bulgarian idea to regain ascendancy in the region. The Bulgarian advance in Macedonia in the 19th century was aided by the numerical superiority of the [[Bulgarians]] after the decrease in the [[Turkic peoples|Turkish]] population, as well as by their improved economic status. The Bulgarians of Macedonia took active part in the struggle for independent [[Bulgarian Patriarchate]] and Bulgarian schools.

The representatives of the intelligentsia wrote in a language which they called Bulgarian and strove for a more even representation of the local Bulgarian dialects spoken in Macedonia in formal Bulgarian. The autonomous [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] established in 1870 included northwestern Macedonia. After the overwhelming vote of the districts of [[Ohrid]] and [[Skopje]], it grew to include the whole of present-day [[Vardar Macedonia|Vardar]] and [[Pirin Macedonia]] in 1874. This process of [[Bulgarian national revival]] in Macedonia, however, was much less successful in historical Macedonia, which beside Slavs had compact [[Greek people|Greek]] and [[Aromanian people|Aromanian]] populations. The Hellenic idea and the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] preserved much of their earlier influence among local Bulgarians and the arrival of the Bulgarian idea turned the region into a battlefield between those owing allegiance to the Patriarchate and tose to Exarchate with division lines often separating family and kin.

At that time it was  believed that the extent of the Albanian language reached south to the [[Ambracian Gulf]] because the area between eastern [[Montenegro]] and the Ambracian Gulf was called "Albania" at the time (see also: [[:File:Karte von Griechenland und der europäischen Türkei 1829.JPG|this classical map]]) because it was supposed that medieval Albania spread over these territories (see also: [[:File:Europa 1400.jpg|here]]).]]{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

European ethnographs and linguists until the [[Congress of Berlin]] usually regarded the language of the Slavic population of Macedonia as [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Bulgarian]]. French scholars [[Ami Boué]] in 1840 and [[Guillaume Lejean]] in 1861, Germans [[August Grisebach]] in 1841, J. Hahn in 1858 and 1863, [[August Heinrich Petermann]] in 1869 and [[Heinrich Kiepert]] in 1876, Slovak [[Pavel Jozef Safarik]] in 1842 and the Czechs [[Karel Jaromír Erben]] in 1868 and F. Brodaska in 1869, Englishmen James Wyld in 1877 and [[Paulina Irby|Georgina Muir Mackenzie]] and [[Paulina Irby|Adeline Paulina Irby]] in 1863, Serbians Davidovitch in 1848, Constant Desjardins in 1853 and Stefan I. Verković in 1860, Russians Viktor I. Grigorovič in 1848 Vinkenty Makushev and M.F. Mirkovitch in 1867, as well as Austrian Karl Sax in 1878 published ethnography or linguistic books, or travel notes, which defined the Slavic population of Macedonia as Bulgarian. Austrian doctor [[Josef Müller (Austrian doctor)|Josef Müller]] published travel notes in 1844 where he regarded the [[Slavic people|Slavic]] population of Macedonia as Serbian.  The region was further identified as predominantly Greek by French F. Bianconi in 1877 and by Englishman [[Edward Stanford]] in 1877. He maintained that the urban population of Macedonia was entirely Greek, whereas the peasantry was of mixed, Bulgarian-Greek origin and had Greek consciousness but had not yet mastered the Greek language.

[[File:Bulgarian-Exarchate-1870-1913.jpg|mini|left|300px|thumb|Map of the Bulgarian Exarchate (1870–1913).]]
In Europe, the classic non-national states were the ''multi-ethnic empires'' such as the [[Ottoman Empire]], ruled by a [[Sultan]] and the population belonged to many ethnic groups, which spoke many languages. The idea of [[nation state]] was an increasing emphasis during the 19th century, on the [[ethnic]] and [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] origins of the nations. The most noticeable characteristic was the degree to which nation states use the state as an instrument of ''national unity'', in economic, social and cultural life. By the 19th century, the Ottomans had fallen well behind the rest of Europe in science, technology, and industry. By that time Bulgarians had initiated a purposeful struggle against the [[Greeks|Greek]] clerics. Bulgarian religious leaders had realised that any further struggle for the rights of the [[Bulgarians]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] could not succeed unless they managed to obtain at least some degree of autonomy from the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]. The foundation of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870, which included most of Macedonia by a [[firman (decree)|firman]] of Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] was the direct result of the struggle of the Bulgarian Orthodox against the domination of the Greek [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]] in the 1850s and 1860s.

Afterwards in 1876 the Bulgarians revolted in the ''[[April uprising]]''. The emergence of Bulgarian national sentiments was closely related to the re-establishment of the independent Bulgarian church. This rise of national awareness became known as the [[Bulgarian National Revival]]. However the uprising was crushed by the Ottomans. As result on the [[Constantinople Conference]] in 1876 the predominant Bulgarian character of the Slavs in Macedonia reflected in the borders of future autonomous Bulgaria as it was drawn there. The [[Great Powers]] eventually gave their consent to variant, which excluded historical Macedonia and [[Thrace]], and denied Bulgaria access to the [[Aegean sea]], but otherwise incorporated all other regions in the Ottoman Empire inhabited by Bulgarians. At the last minute, however, the Ottomans rejected the plan with the secret support of Britain. Having its reputation at stake, Russia had no other choice but to [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|declare war on the Ottomans]] in April 1877. The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] from 1878, which reflected the maximum desired by [[Russia]]n expansionist policy, gave Bulgaria the whole of Macedonia except [[Thessaloniki]], the [[Chalcidice]] peninsula and the valley of the [[Aliakmon]].

[[File:Constantinople conference.png|thumb|right|300px|Bulgaria after the Conference of Constantinople, 1876.]]
[[File:Sanstefanska Bulgaria.png|thumb|300px|left|Bulgaria after the Treaty of San Stefano, 1878.]]
The [[Congress of Berlin]] in the same year redistributed most Bulgarian territories that the previous treaty had given to the [[Principality of Bulgaria]] back to the Ottoman Empire. This included the whole of Macedonia. As result in late 1878, the [[Kresna-Razlog Uprising]] – an unsuccessful Bulgarian revolt against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule in the region of Macedonia – broke out. However the decision taken at the [[Congress of Berlin]] soon turned the Macedonian Question into "the apple of constant discord" between Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria. The [[Bulgarian national revival]] in Macedonia was not unopposed. The Greeks and Serbs, too, had national ambitions in the region, and believed that these could be furthered by a policy of cultural and linguistic dissimilation of the Macedonian Slavs, to be achieved through educational and church propaganda. Nonetheless, by the 1870s the Bulgarians were clearly the dominant national party in Macedonia. It was widely anticipated that the Macedonian Slavs would continue to evolve as an integral part of the Bulgarian nation, and that, in the event of the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s demise, Macedonia would be included in a Bulgarian successor-state. That these anticipations proved false was due not to any intrinsic peculiarities of the Macedonian Slavs, setting them apart from the Bulgarians, but to a series of catastrophic events, which, over a period of seventy years, diverted the course of Macedonian history away from its presumed trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/en/other/yasamee.html#10 Nationality in the Balkans: The Case of the Macedonians by F.

[[File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|thumb|From the Serbian point of view, the Slavs of Macedonia were Serbian-speakers]]

19th century Serbian nationalism viewed Serbs as the people chosen to lead and unite all southern Slavs into one country, [[Yugoslavia]] (the country of the southern Slavs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The conscience of the peripheral parts of Serbian nation grew, therefore the officials and the wide circles of population considered the slavs of Macedonia as "Southern Serbs", Moslems as "Islamized Serbs", and [[Shtokavian]] speaking part of today's Croatian population as "Catholic Serbs".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} But, the basic interests of Serbian state policy was directed to the liberation of the Ottoman regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo; whilst Macedonia and Vojvodina should be "liberated later".{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The Congress of Berlin of 1878, which granted [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] to [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] occupation and administration whilst nominally Ottoman, redirected Serbia's ambitions to Macedonia and a propaganda campaign was launched at home and abroad to prove the Serbian character of the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A great contribution to the Serbian cause was made by an astronomer and historian from [[Trieste]], [[Spiridon Gopčević]] (also known as Leo Brenner).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Gopčević published in 1889 the ethnographic research ''Macedonia and Old Serbia'', which defined more than three-quarters of the Macedonian population as Serbian.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The population of Kosovo and northern Albania was identified as Serbian or Albanian of Serbian origin (Albanized Serbs, called "Arnauts") and the Greeks along the Aliákmon as Greeks of Serbian origin (Hellenized Serbs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The work of Gopčević was further developed by two Serbian scholars, geographer [[Jovan Cvijić]] and linguist [[Aleksandar Belić]]. Less extreme than Gopčević, Cvijić and Belić claimed only the Slavs of northern Macedonia were Serbian whereas those of southern Macedonia were identified as "Macedonian Slavs", an amorphous Slavic mass that was neither Bulgarian, nor Serbian but could turn out either Bulgarian or Serbian if the respective people were to rule the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j_NbmSoRsRcC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=who+are+the+macedonians&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Who are the Macedonians?''] Hugh Poulton, C.

[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Greek ethnographic map by Professor George Soteriadis, University of Athens 1918.]]

It was established by the end of the 19th century that the majority of the population of central and Southern Macedonia (vilaets of Monastiri and Thessaloniki) were predominantly an ethnic [[Greek Macedonians|Greek population]], while the Northern parts of the region (vilaet of [[Skopje]]) were predominantly Slavic. Jews and Ottoman communities were scattered all over. Because of Macedonia's such polyethnic nature, the arguments which Greece used to promote its claim to the whole region were usually of historical and religious character. The Greeks consistently linked nationality to the allegiance to the Patriarchate of [[Constantinople]]. "Bulgarophone", "Albanophone" and "Vlachophone" Greeks were coined to describe the population who were Slavic, Albanian or [[Vlachs|Vlach]] ([[Aromanian language|Aromanian]])-speaking. There was also pressure on Aromanians to become linguistically dissimilated from the 18th century, when dissimilation efforts were encouraged by the Greek missionary [[Cosmas of Aetolia]] (1714–1779) who taught that Aromanians should speak Greek because as he said "it's the language of our Church" and established over 100 Greek schools in northern and western Greece. The offensive of the clergy against the use of Aromanian was by no means limited to religious issues but was a tool devised in order to convince the non-Greek speakers to abandon what they regarded as a "worthless" idiom and adopt the superior Greek speech: "There we are [[Metsovon|Metsovian]] brothers, together with those who are fooling themselves with this sordid and vile Aromanian language... forgive me for calling it a language", "repulsive speech with a disgusting diction".&lt;ref&gt;Neofytos Doukas, "Logos peri katastaseos skholeion"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thede Kahl, Ethnizität und räumliche Verteilung der Aromunen in Südeuropa. Münster, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the Serbian and Bulgarian propaganda efforts, the Greek one initially also concentrated on education. Greek schools in Macedonia at the turn of the 20th century totalled 927 with 1,397 teachers and 57,607 pupils. As from the 1890s, Greece also started sending armed guerrilla groups to Macedonia (see [[Greek Struggle for Macedonia]]) especially after the death of [[Pavlos Melas]], which fought the detachments of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO).

The Greek cause predominated in historical Macedonia where it was supported by the native Greeks and by a substantial part of the Slavic and Aromanian populations. Support for the Greeks was much less pronounced in central Macedonia, coming only from a fraction of the local Aromanians and Slavs; in the northern parts of the region it was almost non-existent.

The Bulgarian propaganda made a comeback in the 1890s with regard to both education and arms. At the turn of the 20th century there were 785 Bulgarian schools in Macedonia with 1,250 teachers and 39,892 pupils. The Bulgarian Exarchate held jurisdiction over seven dioceses ([[Skopje]], [[Debar]], [[Ohrid]], [[Bitola]], [[Nevrokop]], [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and [[Strumica]]), i.e., the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia and some of southern Macedonia. The [[Bulgarian Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Committee]] (BMARC), which was founded in 1893 as the only guerilla organization established by locals, quickly developed a wide network of committees and agents turning into a "state within the state" in much of Macedonia. The organization changed its name on several occasions, settling to IMRO in 1920. IMRO fought not only against the Ottoman authorities, but also against the pro-Serbian and pro-Greek parties in Macedonia, terrorising the population supporting them.

The failure of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]] in 1903 signified a second weakening of the Bulgarian cause resulting in closure of schools and a new wave of emigration to Bulgaria. IMRO was also weakened and the number of Serbian and Greek guerilla groups in Macedonia substantially increased. The Exarchate lost the dioceses of Skopje and Debar to the Serbian Patriarchate in 1902 and 1910, respectively. Despite this, the Bulgarian cause preserved its dominant position in central and northern Macedonia and was also strong in southern Macedonia.

The independence of Bulgaria in 1908 had the same effect on the Bulgarian idea in Macedonia as the independence of Greece to the Hellenic a century earlier. The consequences were closure of schools, expelling of priests of the Bulgarian Exarchate and emigration of the majority of the young Macedonian intelligentsia. This first emigration triggered a constant trickle of Macedonian-born refugees and emigrants to Bulgaria. Their number stood at ca. 100,000 by 1912.

The [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Slav Macedonian]] ideology during the second half of the 19th century was at its inception. One of the first preserved accounts is an article [[s:The Macedonian question|The Macedonian question]] by [[Petko Slaveykov]], published on 18 January 1871 in the "Macedonia" newspaper in [[Constantinople]]. In 1880, [[Georgi Pulevski]] published ''Slognica Rechovska'' in [[Sofia]] as an attempt at a grammar of the language of the Slavs who lived in Macedonia. Although he had no formal education, Pulevski published several other books, including three dictionaries and a collection of songs from Macedonia, customs, and holidays. In 1888, [[Kuzman Shapkarev]] wrote to [[Marin Drinov]] with regard to the usage of the words Macedonian and Bulgarian:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But even stranger is the name ''Macedontsi'', which was imposed on us only 10 to 15 years ago by outsiders, and not as something by our own intellectuals.... Yet the people in Macedonia know nothing of that ancient name, reintroduced today with a cunning aim on the one hand and a stupid one on the other. They know the older word: ''Bugari'', although mispronounced: they have even adopted it as peculiarly theirs, inapplicable to other Bulgarians".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first significant manifestation of Slav Macedonian nationalism was the book [http://mk.wikisource.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%B0_%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5_%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B8 За Македонските Работи] (''Za Makedonskite Raboti'' – [[s:On Macedonian Matters|On Macedonian Matters]], Sofia, 1903) by [[Krste Misirkov]]. In the book Misirkov advocated that the Slavs of Macedonia should take a separate way from the Bulgarians and the Bulgarian language. Misirkov considered that the term "Macedonian" should be used to define the whole Slavic population of Macedonia, obliterating the existing division between Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbians. The adoption of a separate "Macedonian language" was also advocated as a means of unification of the  Ethnic Macedonians with Serbian, Bulgarian and Greek consciousness. ''On Macedonian Matters'' was written  in the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] dialect spoken in central Bitola-[[Prilep]]. This dialect was proposed by Misirkov as the basis for the future language, and, as Misirkov says, a dialect which is most different from all other neighboring languages (as the eastern dialect was too close to Bulgarian and the northern one too close to Serbian). Misirkov calls this language Macedonian.

While Misirkov talked about the Macedonian consciousness and the Macedonian language as a future goal, he described the wider region of Macedonia in the early 20th century as inhabited by Bulgarians, Greeks, Serbs, Turks, Albanians, Aromanians, and Jews. As regards to the Ethnic Macedonians themselves, Misirkov maintained that they had called themselves Bulgarians until the publication of the book and were always called Bulgarians by independent observers until 1878 when the Serbian views also started to get recognition. Misirkov rejected the ideas in ''On Macedonian Matters'' later and turned into a staunch advocate of the Bulgarian cause – only to return to the (Slav) Macedonian idea again in the 1920s.

Another prominent activist for the ethnic Macedonian national revival was Dimitrija Čupovski, who was one of the founders and the president of the [[Macedonian Literary Society]] established in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1902. During the 1913–18 period, Čupovski published the newspaper ''Makedonski Golos''' (Македонскi Голосъ) (meaning ''Macedonian voice'') in which he and fellow members of the Petersburg Macedonian Colony propagandized the existence of a separate [[ethnic Macedonians|Macedonian people]] different from Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbs, and were struggling for popularizing the idea for an independent Macedonian state.

Following the [[Second Balkan War]] in 1913, the partition of Macedonia among three entities who had taken part in the battle (Serbia, Greece and Bulgaria) placed today's territory within the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. Serbian rule ensured that all Slav Macedonian symbolism and identity were henceforth proscribed, and only standard Serbian was permitted to be spoken by the locals of Macedonia. In addition, Serbia did not refer to its southern land as ''Macedonia'', a legacy which remains in place today among Serbian nationalists (e.g. the [[Serbian Radical Party]]).

The ideas of Misirkov, Pulevski and other ethnic Macedonian Slavs would remain largely unnoticed until the 1940s when they were adopted by the [[Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia]] influencing the codification of the Macedonian language. Claims of present-day historians from the [[Republic of Macedonia]] that the "Autonomists" in IMRO who defended a Macedonian position are largely ungrounded. IMRO regarded itself – and was regarded by the Ottoman authorities, the Greek guerilla groups, the contemporary press in Europe and even by Misirkov -as an exclusively Bulgarian organization {{citation needed|date=October 2012}}{{dubious|date=October 2012}}. The present-day historians from the Republic of Macedonia claim that IMRO was split into two factions: the first aimed an ethnic Macedonian state, and the second believed in a Macedonia as a part of wider Bulgarian entity.

Attempts at Romanian propaganda among the Aromanian population of Macedonia began in the early 19th century and were based mainly on linguistic criteria, as well as the claim of a common [[Thraco-Roman]] origin of [[Romanians]] (Daco-Romanians) and Aromanians (Macedo-Romanians), the two most numerous [[Vlach]] populations.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The first [[Romanian language|Romanian]] Vlach school was, however, established in 1864 in Macedonia.

Though the Romanian propaganda made some success in Bitola, Kruševo, and in the Aromanian villages in the districts of Bitola and Ohrid.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}{{dubious|date=October 2012}} Macedonian Aromanians regarded themselves as a separate ethnic group, and Romanians view such nations as subgroups of a wider Vlach ethnicity.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}
During the [[Second Balkan War]], when Bulgaria attacked Greece and Serbia, Romania took advantage of the situation to occupy the region of South Dobrudja, where the majority of the population was Bulgarian and Turkish. This was considered a "repayment" for the lands in Macedonia, occupied by Aromanians but included in Bulgaria after the [[First Balkan War]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Independent sources in Europe between 1878 and 1918 generally tended to view the Slavic population of Macedonia in two ways: as Bulgarians and as Macedonian Slavs. German scholar [[Gustav Weigand]] was one of the most prominent representatives of the first trend with the books ''Ethnography of Macedonia'' (1924, written 1919) and partially with ''The Aromanians'' (1905). The author described all ethnic groups living in Macedonia, showed empirically the close connection between the western Bulgarian dialects and the Macedonian dialects and defined the latter as Bulgarian. The International Commission constituted by the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in 1913 to inquire into causes and conduct of the [[Balkan Wars]] also talked about the Slavs of Macedonia as about Bulgarians in its report published in 1914. The Commission had eight members from Great Britain, France, [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany, [[Russia]] and the United States.

The term "Macedonian Slavs" was used by scholars and publicists in three general meanings:
* as a politically convenient term to define the Slavs of Macedonia without offending Serbian and Bulgarian nationalism;
* as a distinct group of Slavs different from both Serbs and Bulgarians, yet closer to the Bulgarians and having predominantly Bulgarian ethnical and political affinities;
* as a distinct group of Slavs different from both Serbs and Bulgarians having no developed national consciousness and no fast ethnical and political affinities (the definition of Cvijic).

An instance of the use of the first meaning of the term was, for example, the ethnographic map of the Slavic peoples published in (1890) by Russian scholar Zarjanko, which identified the Slavs of Macedonia as Bulgarians. Following an official protest from Serbia the map was later reprinted identifying them under the politically correct name "Macedonian Slavs".

The term was used in a completely different sense by British journalist [[Henry Brailsford]] in ''Macedonia, its races and their future'' (1906). The book contains Brailford's impressions from a five-month stay in Macedonia shortly after the suppression of the Ilinden Uprising and represents an ethnographic report. Brailford defines the dialect of Macedonia as neither Serbian, nor Bulgarian, yet closer to the second one. An opinion is delivered that any Slavic nation could "win" Macedonia if it is to use the needed tact and resources, yet it is claimed that the Bulgarians have already done that. Brailsford uses synonymously the terms "Macedonian Slavs" and "Bulgarians", the "Slavic language" and the "Bulgarian language". The chapter on the Macedonians Slavs/the Bulgarians is titled the "Bulgarian movement", the IMRO activists are called "Bulgarophile Macedonians".

The third use of the term can be noted among scholars from the allied countries (above all France and the United Kingdom) after 1915 and is roughly equal to the definition given by Cvijic (see above).

According to Edmund Spencer:&lt;ref&gt;"Travels in European Turkey", vol. II, London, 1851, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The inhabitants are for the most part composed of Rayahs, a mixed race of Greeks, Bulgarians and Serbians, who, it cannot be doubted, would join to the man their brethren in faith of Serbia and Upper Moesia. It must therefore be evident that the great danger to be apprehended to the rule of the Osmanli in these provinces, is the successful inroad of the Serbian nationality into Macedonia; with this people they have the tradition of right, and their former greatness, aided by the powerful ties of race and creed&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Development of the name "Macedonian Slavs" ===
[[File:Macedonians coloured on this map from 1922.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Ethnographic map of the Balkans, 1922.]]
The name "Macedonian Slavs" started to appear in publications at the end of the 1880s and the beginning of the 1890s. Though the successes of the Serbian propaganda effort had proved that the Slavic population of Macedonia was not only Bulgarian, they still failed to convince that this population was, in fact, Serbian. Rarely used until the end of the 19th century compared to 'Bulgarians', the term 'Macedonian Slavs' served more to conceal rather than define the national character of the population of Macedonia. Scholars resorted to it usually as a result of Serbian pressure or used it as a general term for the Slavs inhabiting Macedonia regardless of their ethnic affinities. The Serbian politician [[:sr:Stojan Novaković|Stojan Novaković]] proposed in 1887 employing the [[Macedonism|Macedonistic]] ideas as they means to counteract the Bulgarian influence in Macedonia, thereby promoting Serbian interests in the region.&lt;ref&gt;From the report of S. Novakovic to the Minister of Education in Belgrade about ''Macedonism'' as a transitional stage in Serbianization of the Macedonian Bulgarians - BULGARIAN ACADEMY OF SCIENCES - Institute of History - Bulgarian Language Institute, MACEDONIA, DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS - Sofia 1978. [http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/ban/ls1.html#34]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the continued Serbian propaganda effort and especially the work of [[Cvijic]] had managed to firmly entrench the concept of the Macedonian Slavs in European public opinion, and the name was used almost as frequently as 'Bulgarians'.  Even pro-Bulgarian researchers such as H. [[Henry Brailsford]] and N. Forbes argued that the Macedonian Slavs differed from both Bulgarians and Serbs. Practically all scholars before 1915, however, including strongly pro-Serbian ones such as [[Robert William Seton-Watson]], admitted that the affinities of the majority of them lay with the Bulgarian cause and the Bulgarians and classified them as such.  Even in 1914 the Carnegie Commission report states that the Serbs and Greeks classified the Slavs of Macedonia as a distinct group "Slav-Macedonians" for political purposes and this term is "political euphemism designed to conceal the existence of [[Bulgarians in Macedonia]]".&lt;ref&gt;"A comparison of the ethnographic and linguistic maps drawn up by Messers Kantchev, Tsviyits (Cviyic) and Belits, with the new frontiers of the treaty of Bucharest reveals the gravity of the task undertaken by the Servians.  They have not merely resumed possession of their ancient domain, the Sandjak and Novi-Bazar and Old Servia proper (Kosovo Pole and Metchia), despite the fact that this historic domain was strongly Albanian; they have not merely added there to the tract described by patriotic Servian ethnographers as "Enlarged Old Servia"; over and above all this, their facile generosity impelled them to share with the Greeks the population described on their map as Slav Macedonian a euphemism designed to conceal the existence of Bulgarians in Macedonia. And their acquisitions under the treaty of Bucharest went beyond their most extravagant pretensions. They took advantage of the Bulgarians' need to conclude peace at any price to deprive them of territories to the east of the Vardar, for example, Chtipe and Radoviche, where Bulgarian patriotism glowed most vividly and where the sacrifices accepted by Bulgarian patriots for the sake of freeing Macedonia, had always been exceptionally great. This was adding insult to injury"&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgaria's entry into World War I on the side of the [[Central Powers]] signified a dramatic shift in the way European public opinion viewed the Slavic population of Macedonia. For the Central Powers the Slavs of Macedonia became nothing but Bulgarians, whereas for the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] they turned into anything other than Bulgarians. The ultimate victory of the Allies in 1918 led to the victory of the vision of the Slavic population of Macedonia as Macedonian Slavs, an amorphous Slavic mass without a developed national consciousness.

During the 1920s the [[Comintern]] developed a new policy for the Balkans, about collaboration between the communists and the Macedonian movement, and the creation of a united Macedonian movement. The idea for a new unified organization was supported by the [[Soviet Union]], which saw a chance of using this well developed revolutionary movement to spread revolution in the Balkans and destabilize the Balkan monarchies. In the so-called ''May Manifesto of 6 May 1924'', for the first time the objectives of the unified [[Slav Macedonian]] liberation movement were presented: independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia, fighting all the neighbouring Balkan monarchies, forming a [[Balkan Communist Federation]] and cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]].

Later the Comintern published a [[Resolution of the Comintern on the Macedonian Question|resolution about the recognition of Macedonian ethnicity]]. The text of this  document was prepared in the period December 20, 1933 – January 7, 1934, by the Balkan Secretariat of the Comintern. It was accepted by the Political Secretariat in Moscow on January 11, 1934, and approved by the Executive Committee of the Comintern. The Resolution  was published for the first time in the April issue of ''Makedonsko Delo'' under the title ‘The Situation in Macedonia and the Tasks of [[IMRO (United)]]’.

=== Absent national consciousness ===

What stood behind the difficulties to properly define the nationality of the Slavic population of Macedonia was the apparent levity with which this population regarded it. The existence of a separate Macedonian national consciousness prior to the 1940s is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Loring M. Danforth, ''The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World'', 1995, Princeton University Press, p.65, {{ISBN|0-691-04356-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Palmer, Robert King, ''Yugoslav Communism and the Macedonian question'', Hamden, CT Archon Books, 1971, pp. 199-200&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion is illustrated by Robert Newman in 1935, who recounts discovering in a village in [[Vardar Macedonia]]&lt;ref name="vardar"&gt;"Vardar Macedonia" is the portion of the [[region of Macedonia]] currently occupied by the [[Republic of Macedonia]].&lt;/ref&gt; two brothers, one who considered himself a Serb, and the other considered himself a Bulgarian. In another village he met a man who had been, "a Macedonian peasant all his life", but who had varyingly been called a Turk, a Serb and a Bulgarian.&lt;ref name="newman1952"&gt;Newman, R. (1952) ''Tito's Yugoslavia'' (London)&lt;/ref&gt; However anti-Serb and pro-Bulgarian feelings among the local population at this period prevailed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j_NbmSoRsRcC&amp;dq=who+are+the+macedonians&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=0Koghj-huR&amp;source=bn&amp;sig=EO5JjWd8XqDxMuwjEsjYx2dFY7w&amp;hl=bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA101,M1 ''Who are the Macedonians?''] Hugh Poulton, Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers, 1995, {{ISBN|978-1-85065-238-0}}, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nationality in early-20th-century Macedonia was a matter of political convictions and financial benefits, of what was considered politically correct at the specific time and of which armed guerrilla group happened to visit the respondent's home last. The process of Hellenization at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century affected only a limited stratum of the population, the [[Bulgarian Revival]] in the middle of the 19th century was too short to form a solid Bulgarian consciousness, the financial benefits given by the Serbian propaganda were too tempting to be declined. It was not a rare occurrence for whole villages to switch their nationality from Greek to Bulgarian and then to Serbian within a few years or to be Bulgarian in the presence of a Bulgarian commercial agent and Serbian in the presence of a Serbian consul. On several occasions peasants were reported to have answered in the affirmative when asked if they were Bulgarians and again in the affirmative when asked if they were Serbs. Though this certainly cannot be valid for the whole population, many Russian and Western diplomats and travelers defined Macedonians as lacking a "proper" national consciousness.

The basis of the Ottoman censuses was the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet system]]. People were assigned to ethnic categories according to religious affiliation. So all Sunni Muslims were categorised as Turks, all members of Greek Orthodox church as Greeks, while rest being divided between Bulgarian and Serb Orthodox churches.&lt;ref name = "Ortayli 2006 89-8"&gt;Ortaylı, İlber.

====''Encyclopædia Britannica''====
The 1911 edition of the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' gave the following statistical estimates about the population of Macedonia:&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
*Slavs (described in the encyclopaedia as a "Slavonic population, the bulk of which is regarded by almost all independent sources as Bulgarians"): approximately 1,150,000, whereof, 1,000,000 Orthodox and 150,000 [[Muslim]]s (called [[Pomaks]])
*Turks: ca. 500,000 (Muslims)
*Greeks: ca. 250,000, whereof ca. 240,000 Orthodox and 14,000 Muslims
*Albanians: ca. 120,000, whereof 10,000 Orthodox and 110,000 Muslims
*Vlachs: ca. 90,000 Orthodox and 3,000 Muslims
*Jews: ca. 75,000
*Roma: ca. 50,000, whereof 35,000 Orthodox and 15,000 Muslims

In total 1,300,000 Christians (almost exclusively Orthodox), 800,000 Muslims, 75,000 Jews, a total population of ca. 2,200,000 for the whole of Macedonia.

It needs to be taken into account that part of the Slavic-speaking population in southern Macedonia regarded itself as ethnically Greek and a smaller percentage, mostly in northern Macedonia, as Serbian. All Muslims (except the Albanians) tended to view themselves and were viewed as Turks, irrespective of their mother tongue.

=====Sample statistical data from neutral sources=====

The following data reflects the population of the wider region of Macedonia as it was defined by Serbs and Bulgarians (Aegean, Vardar and Pirin), roughly corresponding to [[Manastir Vilayet]], [[Salonica Vilayet]] and [[Kosovo Vilayet]] of Ottoman Macedonia which was significantly larger than the traditional region known to the Greeks.

After the great population exchanges of the 1920s, 380,000 Turks left Greece and 538,253 Greeks came to Macedonia from Asia Minor. After the signing of the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]] in 1919, Greece and Bulgaria agreed on a population exchange on the remaining Bulgarian minority in Macedonia. In the same year some 66,000 Bulgarians and other Slavophones left to Bulgaria and Serbia, while 58,709 Greeks entered Greece from Bulgaria

====Statistical data of Greek Macedonia====

According to A. Angelopoulos, published in the Journal of Balkan Studies, [[Greek Macedonia]]'s national makeup in 1913 was 44.2% Greek, 38.9% Muslim, 8.7% Bulgarian and 8.2% others.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckh K., ''Von Den Balkankriegen Zum Ersten Weltkrieg'', Dissertation accepted, Ludwig-Maximilians University, 1994/95, S.227. {{ISBN|3-486-56173-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelopoulos A., Population distribution of Greece Today according to Language, National Consciousness and Religion, ''Balkan Studies'', 20, p.123-132, 1979&lt;/ref&gt; According to a [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie]] survey based on the ethnographic map of Southern Macedonia, representing the ethnic distribution on the eve of the 1912 Balkan war, published in 1913 by Mr. J. Ivanov, lecturer at the University of Sofia.&lt;ref&gt;http://macedonia.kroraina.com/en/carnegie/chapter4_3.html&lt;/ref&gt; The total numbers belonging to the various nationalities in a territory a little larger than the portion in the same region ceded to the Greeks by the Turks was 1,042,029 inhabitants, of whom 329,371 Bulgarians, 314,854 Turks, 236,755 Greeks, 68,206 Jews, 44,414 Wallachians, 25,302 Gypsies, 15,108 Albanians, 8,019 Miscellaneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carnegie Endowment for International peace REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION|url=http://macedonia.kroraina.com/en/carnegie/chapter4_3.html|publisher=ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[League of Nations]] and at the 1928 census the population consisted of 1,341,00 Greeks (88.8%), 77,000 Bulgarians (5%), 2,000 Turks and 91,000 others,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gillespie, "Mediterranean Politics", Pinter Pub Ltd, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Despott/&gt; but according to Greek archival sources the total number of the Slavic speakers was 200,000.&lt;ref name="Livanios"/&gt;

==20th century==
The [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913) and World War I (1914–1918) left the region of Macedonia divided among Greece, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Albania and resulted in significant changes in its ethnic composition. 50% of the region's territory went to Greece, 40% to Serbia and 10% to Bulgaria. At least several hundred thousand, left their homes,&lt;ref name=Lieberman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lieberman|first1=Benjamin|title=Terrible Fate: Ethnic Cleansing in the Making of Modern Europe|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442230385|pages=76, 75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UXlfAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; the remaining were also subjected to assimilation as all "liberators" after the Balkan War wanted to assimilate as many inhabitants as possible and colonize with settlers form their respective nation.&lt;ref name="Despott"/&gt; The Greeks become the largest population in the region. The formerly leading Muslim and Bulgarian communities were reduced either by extermination or change of identity.

=== Greece ===
The Slavic population was viewed as Slavophone Greeks and prepared to be reeducated in Greek. Any vestiges of Bulgarian and Slavic Macedonia in Greece have been eliminated from the Balkan Wars, continuing to the present.&lt;ref name="Mozjes"/&gt; The Greeks detested the Bulgarians (Slavs of Macedonia), considering them less than human "bears, practising systematic and inhumane methods of extermination and assimilation.&lt;ref name="Mozjes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mozjes|first1=Paul|title=Balkan Genocides: Holocaust and Ethnic Cleansing in the Twentieth Century|date=2011|isbn=9781442206632|pages=37, 38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KwW2O7v7CUcC&amp;pg=PA37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of Bulgarian language had been prohibited, for which the persecution by the police peaked, while during the regime of [[Ioannis Metaxas|Metaxas]] a vigorous assimilation campaign was launched.&lt;ref name="Livanios"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Livanios|first1=Dimitris|title=The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191528729|pages=25, 26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOPUnWM8RAYC&amp;pg=PA26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The civilians have been persecuted solely for identifying as Bulgarian with the slogans "If you want to be free, be Greek" "We shall cut your tongues to teach you to speak Greek."

In many villages people were put to prison and then where released after having proclaimed themselves Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.promacedonia.org/en/am/clean.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The Slavic dialect was considered as being of lowest intelligence with the assumptions that it "consists" only a thousand words of vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Fowkes/&gt; There are official records showing that children professing Bulgarian identity were also murdered for declining to profess Greek identity.&lt;ref name=carnegie/&gt;

After the [[Treaty of Bucharest, 1913|treaty of Bucharest]], some 51% of the ''modern'' region that was known as Macedonia was won by the Greek state (also known as [[Aegean Macedonia|Aegean]] or [[Greek Macedonia]]). This was the only part of Macedonia that Greece was directly interested in. Greeks regarded this land as the only true region of Macedonia as it geographically corresponded to ancient [[Macedon]] and contained an ethnically Greek majority of population. Bulgarian and other non-Greek schools in southern [[Greek Macedonia|(Greek) Macedonia]] were closed and Bulgarian teachers and priests were deported as early as the [[First Balkan War]] simultaneous to deportation of Greeks from Bulgaria. The bulk of the Slavic population of southeastern Macedonia fled to Bulgaria during the Second Balkan War or was resettled there in the 1920s by virtue of a population exchange agreement. The Slavic minority in Greek Macedonia, who were referred to by the Greek authorities as "Slavomacedonians", "Slavophone Greeks" and "Bulgarisants", were subjected to a gradual assimilation by the Greek majority. Their numbers were reduced by a large-scale emigration to North America in the 1920s and the 1930s and to Eastern Europe and Yugoslavia following the [[Greek Civil War]] (1944–1949). At the same time a number of Macedonian Greeks from [[Monastiri]] (modern Bitola) entered Greece.

The 1923 Compulsory [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] led to a radical change in the ethnic composition of Greek Macedonia. Some 380,000 Turks and other Muslims left the region and were replaced by 538,253 Greeks from Asia Minor and [[Eastern Thrace]], including [[Pontic Greeks]] from northeastern [[Anatolia]] and [[Caucasus Greeks]] from the [[South Caucasus]].

According to [[The League of Nations]], the population data for Southern Macedonia in 1928 was the following:

Greece was attacked and occupied by [[Nazism|Nazi]]-led [[Axis Powers|Axis]] during World War II. By the beginning of 1941 the whole of Greece was under a tripartite German, Italian and Bulgarian occupation. The Bulgarians were permitted to occupy [[western Thrace]] and parts of Greek Macedonia, where they persecuted and committed [[massacre]]s and other atrocities against the Greek population. The once thriving Jewish community of [[Thessaloniki]] was decimated by the Nazis, who deported 60,000 of the city's Jews to the German death camps in Germany and German-occupied [[Poland]]. Large Jewish populations in the Bulgarian occupied zone were deported by the Bulgarian army and had an equal death rate to the German zone.

The Bulgarian Army occupied the whole of [[East Macedonia and Thrace|Eastern Macedonia]] and Western Thrace, where it was greeted from a part of a Slav-speakers as liberators.&lt;ref&gt;Loring M. Danforth. The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|978-0-691-04357-9}}.p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Germany and Italy, Bulgaria officially annexed the occupied territories, which had long been a target of [[Greater Bulgaria|Bulgarian irridentism]].&lt;ref name=MazowerB276&gt;Mazower (2000), p. 276&lt;/ref&gt; A massive campaign of "[[Bulgarisation]]" was launched, which saw all Greek officials deported. This campaign was successful especially in Eastern and later in Central Macedonia, when Bulgarians entered the area in 1943.  All Slav-speakers there were regarded as Bulgarians. However it was not so effective in German occupied Western Macedonia. A ban was placed on the use of the Greek language, the names of towns and places changed to the forms traditional in Bulgarian.

In addition, the Bulgarian government tried to alter the ethnic composition of the region, by expropriating land and houses from Greeks in favour of Bulgarian settlers. The same year, the German High Command approved the foundation of a Bulgarian military club in Thessaloníki. The Bulgarians organized supplying of food and provisions for the Slavic population in Central and Western Macedonia, aiming to gain the local population that was in the German and Italian occupied zones. The Bulgarian clubs soon started to gain support among parts of the population. Many Communist political prisoners were released with the intercession of  Bulgarian Club in Thessaloniki, which had made representations to the German occupation authorities. They all declared Bulgarian ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;Uranros, 103-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Makedonia newspaper, 11 May 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, the Bulgarian club asked assistance from the High command in organizing armed units among the Slavic-speaking population in northern Greece. For this purpose, the Bulgarian army, under the approval of the German forces in the Balkans sent a handful of officers from the [[Bulgarian Army]], to the zones occupied by the Italian and German troops to be attached to the German occupying forces as "liaison officers". All the Bulgarian officers brought into service were locally born Macedonians who had immigrated to Bulgaria with their families during the 1920s and 1930s as part of the Greek-Bulgarian Treaty of Neuilly which saw 90,000 Bulgarians migrating to Bulgaria from Greece.

With the help of Bulgarian officers several pro-Bulgarian and anti-Greek armed detachments ([[Ohrana]]) were organized in the [[Kastoria]], [[Florina]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] districts of occupied Greek Macedonia in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia; [[Andon Kalchev]] and Georgi Dimchev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makedonskatribuna.com/IMRO.doc IMRO Militia And Volunteer Battalions Of Southwestern Macedonia, 1943–1944] by Vic Nicholas&lt;/ref&gt; Ohrana (meaning Defense) was an [[autonomist]] pro-Bulgarian organization fighting for unification with [[Greater Bulgaria]]. Uhrana was supported from IMRO leader [[Ivan Mihaylov]] too. It was apparent that Mihailov had broader plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under a German control. It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the Florina, Kastoria and Edessa districts. In the summer of 1944, Ohrana constituted some 12,000 fighters and volunteers from Bulgaria charged with protection of the local population.  During 1944, whole Slavophone villages were armed by the occupation authorities and developed into the most formidable enemy of the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS). Ohrana was dissolved in late 1944 after the German and Bulgarian withdrawal from Greece and [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] movement hardly concealed its intention of expanding.&lt;ref&gt;Macedonia in the 1940s.

Stefanidis&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, many former "Ohranists" were convictеd of a military crimes as collaborationists. It was from this period, after Bulgaria's conversion to communism, that some Slav-speakers in Greece who had referred to themselves as "Bulgarians" increasingly began to identify as "Macedonians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Following the defeat of the Axis powers and the evacuation of the Nazi occupation forces many members of the Ohrana joined the SNOF where they could still pursue their goal of secession. The advance of the [[Red Army]] into Bulgaria in September 1944, the withdrawal of the German armed forces from Greece in October, meant that the Bulgarian Army had to withdraw from Greek Macedonia and Thrace. A large proportion of Bulgarians and Slavic speakers emigrated there. In 1944 the declarations of Bulgarian nationality were estimated by the Greek authorities, on the basis of monthly returns, to have reached 16,000 in the districts of German-occupied Greek Macedonia,&lt;ref&gt;Plundered loyalties: Axis occupation and civil strife in Greek, 1941–1949 by Giannēs S Koliopoulos, London, Hurst &amp; Co.,1999, {{ISBN|978-1-85065-381-3}}, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; but according to British sources, declarations of Bulgarian nationality throughout Western Macedonia  reached 23,000.&lt;ref&gt;F0371/58615, Thessaloniki consular report of 24 Sep. 1946&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1945 World War II had ended and Greece was in open civil war. It has been estimated that after the end of World War II over 40,000 people fled from Greece to Yugoslavia and Bulgaria. To an extent the collaboration of the peasants with the Germans, Italians, Bulgarians or the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS) was determined by the geopolitical position of each village. Depending upon whether their village was vulnerable to attack by the Greek communist guerrillas or the occupation forces, the peasants would opt to support the side in relation to which they were most vulnerable. In both cases, the attempt was to promise "freedom" (autonomy or independence) to the formerly persecuted Slavic minority as a means of gaining its support.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Koliopoulos. Plundered Loyalties: World War II and Civil War in Greek West Macedonia. Foreword by C. M. Woodhouse. New York: New York University Press. 1999. p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Liberation Front (NOF) was organized by the political and military groups of the Slavic minority in Greece, active from 1945 to 1949. The [[interbellum]] was the time when part of them came to the conclusion that they are Macedonians. Greek hostility to the Slavic minority produced tensions that rose to separatism. After the recognition in 1934 from the Comintern of the [[Ethnic Macedonians|Macedonian ethnicity]], the Greek communists have also recognized Macedonian national identity. Soon after the first "free territories" were created it was decided that ethnic Macedonian schools would open in the area controlled by the DSE.{{ref|Pagad}} Books written in the ethnic Macedonian language were published, while ethnic Macedonians theatres and cultural organizations operated. Also within the NOF, a female organization, the [[Women's Antifascist Front of Macedonia|Women's Antifascist Front]] (AFZH), and a youth organization, the National Liberation Front of Youth (ONOM), were formed.{{ref|RisKir4}}

The creation of the ethnic Macedonian cultural institutions in the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] (DSE)-held territory, newspapers and books published by NOF, public speeches and the schools opened, helped the consolidation of the ethnic Macedonian conscience and identity among the population. According to information announced by [[Paskal Mitrovski]] on the I plenum of NOF on August 1948 – about 85% of the Slavic-speaking population in Greek Macedonia has ethnic Macedonian self-identity. The language that was thought in the schools was the official language of the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. About 20,000 young ethnic Macedonians learned to read and write using that language, and learned their own history.

From 1946 until the end of the Civil War in 1949, the NOF was loyal to Greece and was fighting for minimal human rights within the borders of a Greek republic. But  in order to mobilize more ethnic Macedonians into the DSE it was declared on 31 January 1949 at the 5th Meeting of the KKE Central Committee that when the DSE took power in Greece there would be an independent Macedonian state, united in its geographical borders.{{ref|KKEPlenum}} This new line of the KKE affected the mobilisation rate of ethnic Macedonians (which even earlier was considerably high), but did not manage, ultimately, to change the course of the war.

The government forces destroyed every village that was on their way, and expelled the civilian population.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}  Leaving as a result of force or on their own accord (in order to escape repression and retaliation), 50,000 people left Greece together with the retreating DSE forces. All of them were sent to [[Eastern Bloc]] countries.{{ref|RisKir6}}{{ref|StefTr}} It was not until the 1970s that some of them were allowed to come to the Socialist Republic of Macedonia. In the 1980s, the [[Parliament of Greece|Greek parliament]] adopted the law of national reconciliation which allowed DSE members "of Greek origin" to repatriate to Greece, where they were given land. Ethnic Macedonian DSE remembers remained excluded from the terms of this legislation.{{ref|Helsinki}}

On August 20, 2003, the [[Rainbow (political party)|Rainbow Party]] hosted a reception for the "child refugees", ethnic Macedonian children who fled their homes during the Greek Civil War who were permitted to enter Greece for a maximum of 20 days. Now elderly, this was the first time many of them saw their birthplaces and families in some 55 years. The reception included relatives of the refugees who are living in Greece and are members of Rainbow Party. However, many were refused entry by Greek border authorities because their passports listed the [[Former toponyms of Greek places|former names]] of their places of birth.

The present number of the [[Minorities in Greece#Slavic-speaking|"Slavophones"]] in Greece has been subject to much speculation with varying numbers. As Greece does not hold census based on self-determination and mother tongue, no official data is available. It should be noted, however, that the official Macedonian Slav party in Greece receives at an average only 1000 votes. For more information about the region and its population see Greek Macedonia.

After the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913) the Slavs in Macedonia were regarded as southern Serbs and the language they spoke a southern Serbian dialect. Despite their attempts of forceful assimilation, Serb colonists in Vardar Macedonia numbered only 100,000 by 1942, so there was not that colonization and expulsion as in Greek Macedonia.&lt;ref name="Despott"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Despot|first1=Igor|title=The Balkan Wars in the Eyes of the Warring Parties|isbn=9781475947038|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZIbtG7w_rSUC&amp;pg=PA200|pages=250, 253, 198, 258}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnic cleansing was unlikely in Serbia, Bulgarians were given to sign declaration for being Serbs since ancient times, those who refused to sign faced assimilation through terror, while Muslims faced similar discrimination.&lt;ref name=Lieberman/&gt; However, in 1913 Bulgarian revolts broke out in [[Tikvesh]], [[Negotino]], [[Kavadarci]], Vartash, [[Ohrid]], [[Debar]] and [[Struga]], and more than 260 villages were burnt down.&lt;ref name=Despot/&gt; [[Serbia in the Balkan Wars|Serbian]] officials are documented to have buried alive three Bulgarian civilians from [[Pehčevo]] then.&lt;ref&gt;Николов, Борис Й.

The Bulgarian, Greek and Romanian schools were closed, the Bulgarian priests and all non-Serbian teachers were expelled. Bulgarian surname endings '-ov/-ev' were replaced with the typically Serbian ending '-ich' and the population which considered itself Bulgarian was heavily persecuted. The policy of Serbianization in the 1920s and 1930s clashed with popular pro-Bulgarian sentiment stirred by IMRO detachments infiltrating from Bulgaria, whereas local communists favoured the path of self-determination suggested by the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Communist Party in the 1924 May Manifesto.

In 1925, D. J. Footman, the British vice consul at [[Skopje]], addressed a lengthy report for the [[Foreign Office]]. He wrote that "the majority of the inhabitants of ''Southern Serbia'' are [[Orthodox Christian]] Macedonians, [[Ethnology|ethnologically]] more akin to the Bulgarians than to the Serbs." He acknowledged that the Macedonians were better disposed toward Bulgaria because, Bulgarian education system in Macedonia in the time of the Turks, was widespread and effective; and because Macedonians at the time perceived Bulgarian culture and prestige to be higher than those of its neighbors. Moreover, large numbers of Macedonians educated in Bulgarian schools had sought refuge in Bulgaria before and especially after the partitions of 1913. "There is therefore now a large Macedonian element in Bulgaria, continued represented in all Government [[Ministry (government department)|Departments]] and occupying high positions in the army and in the civil service...." He characterized this element as "Serbophobe, [it] mostly desires the incorporation of Macedonia in Bulgaria, and generally supports the  IMRO." However, he also pointed to the existence of the tendency to seek an independent Macedonia with [[Salonica]] as its capital.

Bulgarian troops were welcomed as liberators in 1941 but mistakes of the Bulgarian administration made a growing number of people resent their presence by 1944. It must also to be noted that the [[Bulgarian army]] during the annexation of the region, was partially recruited from the local population, which formed as much as 40%-60% of the soldiers in certain battalions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rdsc.md.government.bg/BG/About/VoennaIstoria/3_08.php Военна Академия "Г.

The population was declared Macedonian, a nationality different from both Serbs and Bulgarians. The decision was politically motivated and aimed at weakening the position of Serbia within Yugoslavia and of Bulgaria with regard to Yugoslavia. Surnames were again changed to include the ending '-ski', which was to emphasise the unique nature of the ethnic Macedonian population.

From the start of the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY), accusations surfaced that new authorities in Macedonia were involved in retribution against people who did not support the formation of the new Yugoslav Macedonian republic. The numbers of dead "counter-revolutionaries" due to organized killings, however is unclear. Besides, many people went throughout the [[Labor camp]] of [[Goli Otok]] in the middle 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/tGoli+Otok.+English/tgoli+otok+english/-2%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=tgoli+otok+english&amp;1%2C1%2C Goli Otok: the island of death : a diary in letters] by Venko Markovski, New York, [[Columbia University Press]], 1984&lt;/ref&gt; This chapter of the partisan's history was a [[taboo]] subject for conversation in the SFRY until the late 1980s, and as a result, decades of official silence created a reaction in the form of numerous data manipulations for nationalist communist propaganda purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bgbook.dir.bg/book.php?ID=12874 Македонската кървава Коледа.

At the times of [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Croatian ruling-class of Yugoslavia]], [[Vardar Banovina]] Province was turned into autonomous Macedonia with a majority of the population declaring on census as ethnic Macedonians, and a [[Macedonian language]] as the official, recognized as distinct from [[Serbo-Croatian]]. The capital was placed in a [[Torlakian]]-speaking region. Persecution of Bulgarian identity by the state continued, along with propaganda.

After the creation of Macedonian Republic the Presidium of [[ASNOM]] which was the highest political organ in Macedonia made several statements and actions that were de facto boycotting the decisions of [[AVNOJ]]. Instead of obeying the order of Tito's General Headquarters to send the main forces of the [[NOV of Macedonia]] to participate in the fighting in the [[Srem]] area for the final liberation  of Yugoslavia, the cadre close to President Metodija Andonov – Cento gave serious thoughts whether it is better to order the preparation for an advance of the 100.000 armed men under his command toward [[Greek Macedonia|northern Greece]] in order to "unify the Macedonian people" into one country.&lt;ref&gt;Методија Андонов - Ченто, Mакедонски Народен Трибун. Ристе Бунтески. Скопје. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Officers loyal to Chento's ideas made a mutiny in the garrison stationed on Skopje's fortress, but the mutiny was suppressed by armed intervention. A dozen officers were shot on place, others sentenced to life imprisonment. Also Chento and his close associates were trying to minimize the ties with Yugoslavia as far as possible and were constantly mentioning the [[United Macedonia|unification of the Macedonian people into one state]], which was against the decisions of AVNOJ.&lt;ref&gt;Не му се судеше на Ченто, му се судеше на АСНОМ.

The Yugoslav secret police made a decisive action and managed to arrest [[Metodija Andonov - Chento]] and his closest men and prevent his policies. Chento's place was taken  by [[Lazar Kolishevski]], who started fully implementing the pro-Yugoslav line.

Later the authorities organised frequent purges and trials of Macedonian people charged with autonomist deviation. Many of the former  [[IMRO (United)]] government officials, were purged from their positions then isolated, arrested, imprisoned or executed on various (in many cases fabricated) charges including: pro-Bulgarian leanings, demands for greater or complete independence of Yugoslav Macedonia, forming of conspirative political groups or organisations, demands for greater democracy, etc. People as [[Panko Brashnarov]], [[Pavel Shatev]], [[Dimitar Vlahov]] and [[Venko Markovski]] were quickly ousted from the new government, and some of them assassinated. On the other hand, former IMRO-members, followers of [[Ivan Mihailov]], were also persecuted by the [[Belgrade]]-controlled authorities on accusations of collaboration with the Bulgarian occupation. [[Metodi Shatorov]]'s supporters in Vardar Macedonia, called ''Sharlisti'', were systematically exterminated by the [[Yugoslav Communist Party]] (YCP) in the autumn of 1944, and repressed for their anti-Yugoslav and pro-Bulgarian political positions.

The encouragement and evolution of [[Macedonian culture]] has had a far greater and more permanent impact on Macedonian nationalism than has any other aspect of Yugoslav policy. While development of national music, films and the graphic arts has been encouraged in Macedonia, the greatest cultural effect has come from the codification of the Macedonian language and literature, the new Macedonian national interpretation of history and the establishment of a [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] in 1967 by Central Committee of the Communist Party of Macedonia.&lt;ref&gt;P a l m e r, I r., E.

The Bulgarian population in [[Pirin Macedonia]] remained Bulgarian after 1913. The "Macedonian Question" became especially prominent after the [[Balkan wars]] in 1912–1913, followed from the withdraw of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the subsequent division of the region of Macedonia between Greece, Bulgaria and Serbia. The Slav – speakers in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasants, but the majority of them were under the influence of the Exarchate and its education system, thus considered themselves as Bulgarians.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/en/ng_1912/text.html The Races and Religions of Macedonia, "National Geographic", Nov 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carnegie Endowment for International peace.

After World War I, the territory of the present-day Republic of Macedonia came under the direct rule of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and was sometimes termed "Southern Serbia". Together with a portion of today's Serbia, it belonged officially to the newly formed Vardar Banovina. An intense program of [[Serbianization]] was implemented during the 1920s and 1930s when Belgrade enforced a Serbian cultural assimilation process on the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Greece, like all other Balkan states, adopted restrictive policies towards its minorities, namely towards its Slavic population in its northern regions, due to its experiences with Bulgaria's wars, including the Second Balkan War, and the Bulgarian inclination of sections of its [[Minorities in Greece#Christian Orthodox Slavophones|Slavic minority]].
[[File:WWI BG MAP.jpg|300 px|right|thumb|Bulgarian campaigns during World War I.]]

IMRO was a "state within the state" in the region in the 1920s using it to launch attacks in the Serbian and the Greek part of Macedonia. By that time IMRO had become a right-wing Bulgarian ultranationalist organization. According to IMRO statistics during  the 1920s in the region of Yugoslav (Vardar) Macedonia operated 53 chetas (armed bands), 36 of which penetrated from Bulgaria, 12 were local and 5 entered from Albania. In the region of Greek (Aegean) Macedonia 24 chetas and 10 local reconnaissance detachments were active. Thousands local of Slavophone Macedonians were repressed by the Yugoslav and Greek authorities on suspicions of contacts with the revolutionary movement. The population in Pirin Macedonia was organized in a mass people's home guard. This militia was the only force, which resisted to the Greek army when general Pangalos launched a military campaign against [[Petrich]] District in 1925, speculatively called the [[War of the Stray Dog]]. IMRO's constant fratricidal killings and assassinations abroad provoked some within Bulgarian military after the coup of 19 May 1934 to take control and break the power of the organization. Meanwhile, the left-wing later did form the new organisation based on the principles of independence and unification of partitioned Macedonia. The new organisation which was an opponent to [[Ivan Mihailov]]'s IMRO was called [[IMRO (United)]]. It was founded in 1925 in Vienna. However, it did not have real popular support and remained active until 1936 and was funded by and closely linked to the [[Comintern]] and the Balkan Communist Federation. In 1934 the Comintern adopted resolution about the recognition of Macedonian nation and confirmed the project of the Balkan Communist Federation about creation of Balkan Federative Republic, including Macedonia.

The outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939, inspired the whole Macedonian community, foremost the refugees from the occupied parts, to seek ways for the liberation of Macedonia. Early in 1941 the British vice-consul at Skopje provided the [[Foreign Office]] with an even more extensive and perceptive analysis of the current state of the [[Macedonian Question]]. He claimed that the vast majority of the Macedonians belonged to the national movement; indeed, he estimated "that 90 percent of all Slav Macedonians were autonomists in one sense or another...." Because the movement was wrapped in secrecy, however, it was extremely difficult to gauge the relative strength of its various currents, except that it could be assumed that IMRO had lost ground since it was banned in Bulgaria and its leaders exiled.

Between 6 April 1941 and 17 April 1941, [[Axis forces]] invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Axis victory was swift, as Yugoslavia had surrendered within 11 days. Macedonian newspaper "Makedonska Tribuna", an organ of Macedonian Patriotic Organisation, published by Macedonian immigrants in the U.S. and [[Canada]], vaunted the German victory in the Invasion and fall of the Kingdom Yugoslavia. At the beginning of the [[Invasion of Yugoslavia]] a meeting was held on April 8, 1941, in Skopje, in which participated mainly followers of the idea for the liberation through independence or autonomy of Macedonia. There were activists of IMRO, as well as [[Yugoslav Communist Party|Yugoslav Communists]] – former IMRO (United) members, followers of the idea for the creation of a pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state under |German and Italian protection. This meeting was to decide of action towards independence of Macedonia, but the situation changed dynamically. The local population in Macedonia met with joy the defeat of Kingdom of Yugoslavia. It saw as the end of Serbian rule  and it was not surprising that the soldiers from [[Vardar Macedonia]], mobilized in the Yugoslav army in large numbers refuse to fight. The Serbian administration in most places had run away afraid not as much of the Germans or Bulgarians but of the revenge of the local  population.

Although the Bulgarian government had officially joined the Axis Powers, it maintained a course of military passivity during the initial stages of the Invasion of Yugoslavia and the [[Battle of Greece]]. German, Italian, and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] troops crushed opposing forces of Yugoslavia and Greece but on 6 April 1941, Yugoslavian airplanes bombed the Bulgarian town of [[Kyustendil]], with 67 people killed and 90 wounded and a suburb of Sofia where 8 people were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Проф.

The Greek government was to hold out until April 30. On 18 April  1941 the Bulgarian government received a telegram from [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] in which he specified the regions to be taken by units of the [[Bulgarian army]]. In Greece, the units were to occupy [[Western Thrace|Thrace]], as well as Macedonia between the Strymon and Nestos rivers. In Yugoslavia, the Bulgarians were to occupy an area from the river [[Vardar]] and [[Pomoravlje (region)|Pomoravlje]] to the [[Pirot]]-[[Vranje]]-[[Skopje]] line. Ribbentrop's telegram said that the line was temporary, i.e., that it could be moved to the west of the river Vardar as well.

The movement of the Bulgarian army in Yugoslavia started on April 19, and in Greece on April 20. The prominent force which occupied most of Vardar Macedonia, was the Bulgarian 5th Army. The 6th and 7th Infantry Divisions were active in invading the Vardar Banovina between 19 and 24 April 1941. The Bulgarian troops were mainly present in the western part of Vardar Macedonia, close to the Italian occupational zone, because of some border clashes with Italians, who implemented Albanian interests and terrorized the local peasants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vojska.net/eng/world-war-2/bulgaria/organization/1941/ Bulgarian army occupation units in Yugoslavia 1941]&lt;/ref&gt; So the most of [[Vardar Banovina]], (including [[Vardar Macedonia]]), was annexed by Bulgaria and along with various other regions became [[Greater Bulgaria]]. The western-most parts of Vardar Macedonia was occupied by the fascist [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. As the Bulgarian Army entered Vardar Macedonia on 19 April 1941,  it was greeted by the local population as liberators as it meant the end of Serbian rule.&lt;ref name=Nanev&gt;''[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/bugarash/mac1941/mac41.html Македония 1941 Възкресение]'' (''Macedonia 1941 Resurrection''), Сотир Нанев (Sotir Nanev), 1942, reprinted 1993 with {{ISBN|954-528-366-1}}, publisher Труд (Trud).{{bg icon}} Memoirs of a Macedonia-born Bulgarian lieutenant participating in the occupation of the Yugoslavian and Greek parts of Macedonia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Minchev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vankovska&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?isbn:1860646247 Between Past and Future: Civil-Military Relations in Post-Communist Balkan States]'', by Biljana Vankovska, 2003, {{ISBN|1-86064-624-7}}, page 270.

Before the German invasion in the [[Soviet Union]], there had not been any [[Resistance movement|resistance]] in Vardar Banovina. At the start of World War II, the Comintern supported a policy of [[non-intervention]], arguing that the war was an imperialist war between various national ruling classes, but when the Soviet Union itself was invaded on 22 June 1941, the Comintern changed its position. The German attack on the Soviet Union sparked the rage of the Communists in Bulgaria. The same day the BCP spread a brochure among the people urging "To hinder by all means the usage of Bulgarian land and soldiers for the criminal purposes of German fascism". Two days later, on 24 June, the BCP called for an armed resistance against the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Bogdan Filov]] government.  After that, and when already months ago Yugoslavia was annexed by Axis Powers, Macedonian Communist partisans, which included Macedonians, Aromanians, Serbs, Albanians, Jews and Bulgarians had begun organizing their resistance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kroraina.com/knigi/partiz.html Кои беа партизаните во Македонија] Никола Петров, Скопје, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The First Skopje Partisan Detachment was founded and had been attacked Axis soldiers on 8 September 1941 in Bogomila, near Skopje. The revolt on 11 October 1941 by the Prilep Partisan Detachment is considered to be the symbolic beginning of the resistance. Armed insurgents from the Prilep Partisan Detachment attacked Axis occupied zones in the city of [[Prilep]], notably a police station, killing one Bulgarian policeman of local origin, which led to attacks in [[Kruševo]] and to the creation of small rebel detachments in other regions of Macedonia. Partisan detachments were formed also in [[Greek Macedonia]] and today's [[Bulgarian Macedonia]] under the leadership of [[Communist Party of Greece]] and Bulgarian Communist Party.

In April 1942 a map titled "The Danube area" was published in Germany, where the so-called "new annexed territories" of Bulgaria in [[Vardar Macedonia|Vardar]] and Greek Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]] were described as "territories under temporary Bulgarian administration". This was a failure for [[Sofia]]'s official propaganda, which claimed to have completed the [[Greater Bulgaria|National unification]] of the Bulgarians and showed the internal contradiction among Italy, Bulgaria and Germany. With the ongoing war, new [[anti-fascist]] partisan units were constantly formed and in 1942 a total of nine small partisan detachments were active in Vardar Macedonia and had maintained control of mountainous territories around [[Prilep]], Skopje, [[Kruševo]] and [[Veles (city)|Veles]]. The clash between the Yugoslav and Bulgarian Communists about possession over Macedonia was not ended. While the Bulgarian Communists avoided organizing mass armed uprising against the Bulgarian authorities, the Yugoslav Communists insisted that no liberation could be achieved without an armed revolt. With the help of the Comintern and of [[Joseph Stalin]] himself a decision was taken and the Macedonian Communists were attached to CPY.&lt;ref&gt;Open Society Archives - FOLDER-REPORT: 79-4-361 Vukmanovic Describes Conflict with Bulgarians, Slobodan Stankovic, 1971-2-11 {{cite web |url=http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/79-4-361.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416134929/http://files.osa.ceu.hu/holdings/300/8/3/text/79-4-361.shtml |archivedate=2008-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the unwillingness of local Communists for earnest struggle against the [[Bulgarian Army]], the Supreme Staff of CPY took measurements for strengthening of the campaign.

Otherwise the policy of minimal resistance changed towards 1943 with the arrival of the [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] [[Svetozar Vukmanović-Tempo]], who began to organize an energetic struggle against the Bulgarian occupants. Tempo served on the Supreme Staff of CPY and became [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s personal representative in the Vardar Banovina.
[[File:Map of Bulgaria during WWII.png|300px|thumb|Bulgaria during World War II.]]

Meanwhile, the Bulgarian government was responsible for the round-up and deportation of over 7,000 Jews in Skopje and Bitola. It refused to deport the Jews from Bulgarian proper but later under German pressure those Jews from the new annexed territories, without a Bulgarian [[citizenship]] were deported, as these from Vardar Macedonia and Western Thrace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10006804 THE HOLOCAUST IN MACEDONIA: DEPORTATION OF MONASTIR JEWRY] [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulgarian authorities created a special [[Gendarmerie]] forces which received almost unlimited power to pursue the Communist partisans on the whole territory of the kingdom. The gendarmes became notorious for carrying out atrocities against captured partisans and their supporters. Harsh rule by the occupying forces and a number of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victories indicated that the Axis might lose the war and that encouraged more Macedonians to support the communist [[Partisan (military)|Partisan]] resistance movement of [[Josip Broz Tito]].

Many former IMRO members assisted the Bulgarian authorities in fighting Tempo's partisans. With the help of Bulgarian government and former IMRO members, several pro-Bulgarian and anti-Greek  detachments – [[Uhrana]] were organized in occupied [[Greek Macedonia]] in 1943. These were led by Bulgarian officers originally from Greek Macedonia and served for protection of the local population in the zone under German and Italian control. After the capitulation of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] in September 1943, the Italian zone in Macedonia was taken over by the Germans. Uhrana was supported from [[Ivan Mihailov]]. It was apparent that Mihailov had broader plans which envisaged the creation of a Macedonian state under a German control. He was follower of the idea about a [[United Macedonia]]n state with prevailing Bulgarian element.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vest.com.mk/default.asp?id=3372&amp;idg=1&amp;idb=215&amp;rubrika=Revija Beсник "Вест", Година:1 Број:215 Сабота 3/24/2001] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016085203/http://www.vest.com.mk/default.asp?id=3372&amp;idg=1&amp;idb=215&amp;rubrika=Revija |date=2005-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also anticipated that the IMRO volunteers would form the core of the armed forces of a future Independent Macedonia in addition to providing administration and education in the [[Florina]], [[Kastoria]] and [[Edessa, Greece|Edessa]] districts.

Then in the resistance movement in Vardar Macedonia were clearly visible two political tendencies. The first one was represented by Tempo and the newly established Macedonian Communist Party, gave priority to battling against any form of manifest or latent pro-Bulgarian sentiment and to bringing the region into the new projected Communist Yugoslav Federation. Veterans of the pro-Bulgarian IMRO and IMRO (United) who had accepted the solution of the Macedonian Question as an ethnic preference, now regarded the main objective as being the unification of Macedonia into a single state, whose postwar future was to involve not necessarily inclusion in a Yugoslav federation. They foresaw in it a new form of Serbian dominance over Macedonia, and prefer rather membership of a Balkan federation or else independence.&lt;ref&gt;Spyridon Sfetas -Autonomist Movements of the Slavophones in 1944.

In Spring of 1944 the Macedonian National Liberation Army launched an operation called "The Spring Offensive" engaging German and Bulgarian Armies, which had over 60,000 military and administrative personnel in the area.&lt;ref&gt;Narodnooslobodilachka vojska Jugoslavije. Pregled Razvoja oruzhanih snaga narodnooslobodilachkog pokreta, 1941–45, Belgrade, 1982, 590-815&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Strumica]], approximately 3,800 fighters took part in the formation of military movements of the region; The 4th, 14th and 20th Macedonian Action Brigades, the Strumica Partisan Detachment and the 50th and 51st Macedonian Divisions were formed.[https://web.archive.org/web/20080416012701/http://www.strumicaonline.com/new/display_article.php?aid=3#15] Since the formation of an army in 1943, Macedonian Communist partisans were aspiring to create an autonomous government.

On 2 August 1944, on the 41st anniversary of the [[Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising]], the first session of the newly created Anti-Fascist Assembly of the National Liberation of Macedonia ([[ASNOM]]) was held at the St. [[Prohor Pčinjski]] monastery. А [[manifesto]] was written outlining the future plans of ASNOM for an independent Macedonian state and for creation of the Macedonian language as the official language of the Macedonian state. However, a decision was later reached that Vardar Macedonia will become a part of new Communist Yugoslavia. In the summer of 1944, [[Uhrana|Ohrana]] constituted some 12,000 fighters and volunteers from Bulgaria. Whole Slavophone villages were armed and developed into the most formidable enemy of the [[Greek People's Liberation Army]] (ELAS). At this time [[Ivan Mihailov]] arrived in German occupied Skopje, where the Germans hoped that he could form an  [[Independent State of Macedonia]] with their support on the base of IMRO and Ohrana. Seeing that the war is lost to Germany and to avoid further bloodshed, he refused.

At this time the new Bulgarian government of [[Ivan Ivanov Bagryanov|Ivan Bagryanov]] began secret negotiations with the Allies aiming to find separate peace with repudiating any alliance with [[Nazi Germany]] and declaring neutrality, ending all anti-Jewish laws and ordering the withdrawal of the Bulgarian troops from Macedonia. Through its in Macedonia-born minister of Internal Affairs [[:bg:Александър Станишев|Alexander Stanishev]], the government tried to negotiate with the Macedonian partisans promising that after Bulgarian army withdrawal from [[Vardar Macedonia]] its arms would be given up to the partisans. It would be possible by condition that partisans guaranteed the establishment of pro-Bulgarian Macedonian state without the frame of future Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makedonskatribuna.com/memoirsPM.pdf  Във и извън Македония - спомени на Пандо Кляшев, стр. 276, Македонска Трибуна.]&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations failed and on 9 September 1944 the [[Fatherland Front (Bulgaria)|Fatherland Front]] in Sofia made a coup d'état and deposed the government. After the declaration of war by Bulgaria on Nazi Germany, the withdrawing Bulgarian troops in Macedonia surrounded by German forces, fought their way back to the old borders of Bulgaria. Under the leadership of a new Bulgarian pro-Communist government, three Bulgarian armies, 455,000 strong in total, entered occupied Yugoslavia in late September 1944 and moved from Sofia to [[Niš]] and Skopje with the strategic task of blocking the German forces withdrawing from Greece. They operated here in interaction with local partisans. Southern and eastern Serbia and most of [[Vardar Macedonia]] were liberated within an end of November.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ivan Yanev BULGARIA’S FOREIGN POLICY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR AS REFLECTED IN BULGARIAN HISTORIC LITERATURE 1938–1944 Варна, 2006 Издателство "Литернет" [http://bezmonitor.com/books06/yanev.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Toward the end of November and during early December, the main Bulgarian forces were assembled in liberated [[Serbia]] prior to their return home. The 135,000-strong [[Bulgarian First Army]] continued to [[Hungary]], aided by [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav Partisans]].

However, the Bulgarian army during the annexation of the region was partially recruited from the local population, which formed as much as 40% of the soldiers in certain battalions.

After the end of World War II, the creation of [[People's Republic of Macedonia]] and of a new Macedonian language, it started a process of [[ethnogenesis]] and distinct national Macedonian identity was formed. The new Yugoslav authorities began a policy of removing of any Bulgarian influence, making Macedonia connecting link for the establishment of new Balkan Federation and creating a distinct Slavic consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;Europe since 1945. Encyclopedia by Bernard Anthony Cook. {{ISBN|0-8153-4058-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hafLHZgZtt4C&amp;pg=PA808 pg. 808].&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II the ruling Bulgarian Communists declared the population in [[Bulgarian Macedonia]] as [[ethnic Macedonian]] and teachers were brought in from Yugoslavia to teach the locals in the new Macedonian language. The organizations of the IMRO in Bulgaria were completely destroyed. Former IMRO members were hunted by the Communist [[Militsiya]]  and many of them imprisoned, repressed, exiled or killed. Also internments of disagreeing with this political activities people at the [[Belene labor camp]] were organized. Tito and [[Georgi Dimitrov]] worked about the project  to merge the two Balkan countries Bulgaria and Yugoslavia into a [[Balkan Federative Republic]] according to the projects of Balkan Communist Federation. This led to the 1947 cooperation and signing of [[Bled Agreement (1947)|Bled Agreement]]. It foresaw unification between Vardar Macedonia and Pirin Macedonia and return of [[Western Outlands]] to Bulgaria. They also supported the Greek Communists and especially [[National Liberation Front (Macedonia)|Slavic-Macedonian National Liberation Front]] in the [[Greek Civil War]] with the idea of unification of Greek Macedonia and [[Western Thrace]] to the new state under Communist rule. According this project the [[bourgeoisie]] of the ruling nations in the three [[imperialist]] states among which Macedonia was partitioned, tried to camouflage its national oppression, denying the national features of the Macedonian people and the existence of the Macedonian nation. The policies resulting from the agreement were reversed after the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in June 1948, when Bulgaria, being subordinated to the interests of the [[Soviet Union]] took a stance against Yugoslavia. This policy for projection and recognition of regional countries and nations since the 1930s as for example Macedonia, had been the norm in Comintern policies, displaying Soviet resentment of the [[nation-state]] in Eastern Europe and of the consequences of [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]]. With the 1943 dissolution of Comintern and the subsequent advent of the [[Cominform]] in 1948 came Joseph Stalin's dismissal of the previous ideology, and adaptation to the conditions created for Soviet [[hegemony]] during the [[Cold War]]. The Dimitrov's sudden death in July 1949 was followed by a "[[Titoism|Titoists]]" witchhunt in Bulgaria.

After Greek Communists lost the Greek Civil War, many Slav speakers were expelled from Greece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makedonskatribuna.com/memoirsPM.pdf Във и извън Македония. Спомени на Пандо Младенов стр. 97 - 100]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Genocide of Macedonian Children - "Macedonian tribune" newspaper, Fort Wayhe town, No. 3157 from November 4, 1993.[http://www.macedoniainfo.com/macedonia/Genocide_of_Macedonian_Children.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911094503/http://www.macedoniainfo.com/macedonia/Genocide_of_Macedonian_Children.htm |date=2008-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] originally accepted very few refugees, government policy changed and the Bulgarian government actively sought out refugees from Greek Macedonia. It is estimated that approximately 2,500 children were sent to Bulgaria and 3,000 partisans fled there in the closing period of the war. There was a larger flow into Bulgaria of refugees as the Bulgarian Army pulled out of the Drama-Serres region in 1944. A large proportion of Slavic speakers emigrated there. The "Slavic Committee" in Sofia ({{lang-bg|Славянски Комитет}}) helped to attract refugees that had settled in other parts of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. According to a political report in 1962 the number of political emigrants from Greece numbered at 6,529.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

However, the end of the 1950s was marked by adecisive turn in the "[[Macedonism|Macedonistic]]" policy of Bulgaria, "which did not recognize anymore the existence of a Macedonian ethnicity different from the Bulgarian one". As a result, the trend to a discriminative policy, the refugees from Greece – more targeted at the Slav-speakers and less to "ethnic [[Greeks]]" – was given a certain proselytizing aspect. Eventually many of these migrants were assimilated into Bulgarian society.

At the end of the 1950s the Communist Party repealed its previous decision and adopted a position denying the existence of a "Macedonian" nation. The inconsistent Bulgarian policy has thrown most independent observers ever since into a state of confusion as to the real origin of the population in Bulgarian Macedonia. In 1960, the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]] voted a special resolution explained "with the fact that almost all of the Macedonians have a ''clear Bulgarian national consciousness and consider Bulgaria their homeland''. As result international relations upon the Sofia - Belgrade line deteriorated, and in fact were broken. This led to a final victory of the anti-Bulgarian and pro-Yugoslav oriented Macedonian political circles and signified a definite decline of the very notion of a south Slavonic federation.&lt;ref&gt;Towards a Decline of the Idea of a South Slavonic Federation (January–December 1948) Studies in the History of Russia and Central-Eastern Europe) year: 2005, vol: 40, pages: 205-244 [http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?07PLAAAA02054363] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718084828/http://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?07PLAAAA02054363 |date=2011-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Macedonia the ''Bulgarophobia'' increased almost to the level of state ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Mirjana Maleska.

After the [[Fall of Communism]] and a brief upsurge of [[Macedonian nationalism]] at the beginning of the 1990s,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} sometimes resulting in clashes between nationalist [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO) and ethnic Macedonian separatist organization [[UMO Ilinden-Pirin]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} the commotion has largely subsided in recent time and the ethnic Macedonian idea has become strongly marginalized. A total of 3,100 people in the Blagoevgrad District declared themselves Macedonian in the 2001 census (0.9% of the population of the region).

In Bulgaria today, the Macedonian question has been understood largely as a result of the violation of national integrity, beginning with the revision of the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] from 1878. Bulgaria denies the existence of a separate Macedonian identity. The Bulgarian denouncement is based on the strong sense of loss of the territory, history and language which it shared with Macedonia in the past. After the collapse of the [[Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia]] and the consequent independence of the Macedonian state in 1991, Bulgaria continued to question of the legitimacy of Macedonian nationhood, yet at the same time recognised the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. The Bulgarian government of 1991 promoted this political compromise as a constructive way of living with the [[national question]], rather than suppressing them. Yet none of the fundamental tensions over the Macedonian question have been fully resolved, and the issue remains an important undercurrent in Sofia politics.&lt;ref&gt;Nations and Nationalism

The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] minority in Albania is concentrated in two regions, [[Mala Prespa]] and [[Golloborda]]. In the 1930s the orthodox Slavs living in Albania were regarded as Bulgarians by the local Albanian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Each of them claims that the local Slavic population is Bulgarian/Macedonian.

The [[Republic of Macedonia]] officially celebrates 1991 with regard to the referendum endorsing independence from Yugoslavia, albeit legalizing participation in "future union of the former states of Yugoslavia".

During this period it has been claimed by Macedonian scholars that there exist large and oppressed ethnic Macedonian minorities in the region of Macedonia, located in neighboring states.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7274">'''Eduard Fuchs''' (31 January 1870, [[Göppingen]] &amp;ndash; 26 January 1940, [[Paris]]) was a German [[Marxism|Marxist]] scholar of culture and history, writer, art collector, and political activist.

Fuchs' father was a shopkeeper. Early in his life, the younger Fuchs developed socialist and Marxist political convictions. In 1886, he joined the [[Anti-Socialist Laws|outlawed]] political party Sozialistische Arbeiterpartei (the precursor of the modern [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]], Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands). Fuchs received a doctor of law degree and practiced as an attorney. In 1892, he became editor-in-chief of the satiric weekly ''Süddeutscher Postillon'' and later co-editor of the ''Leipziger Volkszeitung''. His inflammatory articles in newspapers—one accusing the Kaiser of being a mass murderer—resulted in periodic jail sentences. During his periods of confinement, Fuchs wrote various social histories utilizing images as one of his primary sources. The first of these was his ''Karikatur der europäischen Völker'' (Caricatures of European Peoples), 1902.

He moved to [[Berlin]] that same year where he edited the socialist newspaper ''Vorwärts''. The following year he began his magnum opus, an examination of moral practice, ''Sittengeschichte'', eventually running to six volumes by 1912. While engaged in this series, he followed up his interest in caricatures with one devoted to the representation of women, ''Die Frau in der Karikatur'', 1905 (3 vols). Another book documenting the stereotypical representations of Jews appeared in 1912. Fuchs traveled with the artist [[Max Slevogt]] to Egypt in 1914, shortly before the outbreak of World War I. He was a pacifist during the War.  Lenin's government put him in charge of prisoner exchange with Germany after the war; he was among the leaders of the German Comintern in Berlin in 1919. His interest in societal concerns in caricature led to a research interest in [[Honoré Daumier|Daumier]]. Beginning in 1920, Fuchs published a [[catalogue raisonné]] on the artist in three volumes. He resigned from the party in 1929, following the expulsion of several stalwarts. At Hitler's ascension to power in Germany in 1933, Fuchs moved to France.

[[File:Eidophusikon.jpg|thumb|250px|Eidophusikon]]
The '''''Eidophusikon''''' ({{lang-el|Ειδωφυσικον}}) was a piece of [[art]], no longer extant, thought up by the English actor [[David Garrick]] and created by 18th-century [[France|French]] painter [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. It opened in [[Leicester Square]] in February 1781.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Described by the media of his day as "Moving Pictures, representing Phenomena of Nature", the ''Eidophusikon'' can be considered an early form of [[movie making]]. The effect was achieved by mirrors and pulleys.

A small exhibition centered on his Eidophusikon can currently be seen at [[The Huntington Library]].

A full Eidophusikon, described also as a "small, mechanical theatre", was exhibited from June to November 2014 at the exhibition "Underworlds" (Unterwelten) in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]].

The Eidophusikon consisted of a large-scale miniature theatre that let experiment the try of creating the perfect illusion of the moving nature: sunrise scenes, sunsets, moonlight images, storms, and volcanoes from all over the world with sound and music effects. The sound and light effects of the Eidophusikon, compared with the shows seen until that time, were specially inventive by their realism.

== Creation ==
The need to build an element such as this was born from December 1811, when one of the great calamities of American history took place: one of its most important theaters, the Richmond Theater, was burned completely. The fire burned 72 spectators during the first act of a play and expanded rapidly across all locations, causing people to leap into decorations that had not yet been consumed. This made David Garrick think that people could interfere with the theater, and not only was it something that was going to be seen sitting.

== Reconstructions ==
The first reconstruction was the year 2004 by Wolkenbilder at the Altonaer Museum Exhibition (cloud images) at Jenisch Has, Hamburg. It was a full-sized theater with two scenes on the basis of Loutherbourg: from dawn to sunset over Royal Naval College in Greenwich and a Mediterranean scene with a lighthouse, moonlight, storms and wrecks.

The second Eidophusikon was created in 2005 by the Yale Center for British Art, New Connecticut and California Huntington Library by the English painter Gainsborough for his collection 'Sensation and sensibility. Gainsborough was a great admirer of Eidophusikon. This full-size version was built in conjunction with Kevin Derkin and the Yale technical department under Rick Johnson. The scene, this time, was 'Satan and the Creation of the Pandemonium Palace in Hell', by Milton of the "lost paradise."

In 2006, a third Eidophusikon was created by Robert Poulter for the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco. Another Mediterranean scene was created with a volcano, the moonlight, the storm and the shipwreck. This Eidophusikon is part and the permanent collection of the museum.

[[Image:Masada coin.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze [[prutah]] eighth of a shekel of year 4 (69&amp;ndash;70 [[Anno Domini|AD]]) issued during the First Jewish Revolt.]]
'''First Jewish Revolt coinage''' was issued by the [[Jew]]s after the [[Zealots]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish Temple]] from the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 66 [[Anno Domini|AD]] at the beginning of the [[First Jewish-Roman War|First Jewish Revolt]]. The Jewish leaders of the revolt minted their own coins to emphasize their newly obtained independence from [[Rome]].
==History==
In the Revolt's first year (66&amp;ndash;67 AD), the Jews minted only silver coins, which were struck from the Temple’s store of silver. These coins replaced the [[Tyrian shekel]], which had previously been used to pay the [[Temple tax]]. The newly minted silver coins included shekels, half-shekels, and quarter-shekels, each being labelled with the year of minting and their denomination. These are the first truly Jewish silver coins,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/cm/s/silver_shekel_of_the_first_jew.aspx Silver shekel of the First Jewish Revolt from Rome in the British Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; and depict a [[Chalice (cup)|chalice]] on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]] with the year of the revolt above, surrounded by the ancient [[Hebrew]] inscription "Shekel of Israel". Three budding [[pomegranate]]s are featured on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]], with the inscription "Jerusalem the Holy".&lt;ref name=virtual&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/FirstRevolt.html Coins from the First Revolt on Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second (67&amp;ndash;68 AD) and third (68&amp;ndash;69 AD) years of the Revolt [[bronze]] [[prutah]] coins were issued, depicting an [[amphora]], and with the date and the Hebrew inscription (חרות ציון Herut Zion)"The Freedom of Zion".

In the fourth year of the revolt (69&amp;ndash;70 AD) three large sizes of bronze coins were minted, possibly because the supplies of Temple silver were diminishing. It is believed by [[Numismatics|numismatists]] that these coins were fractions of a [[shekel]]. The smaller of these coins also has the depiction of a chalice, together with symbols of the [[Jew]]ish [[harvest festival]] of [[Sukkot]], a [[lulav]] and [[etrog]], and the date and inscription "For the Redemption of Zion". This coin is usually called an 'eighth', probably being an eighth of a shekel.

The medium size coin has the same inscription, with the denomination "''reva''" (quarter) inscribed. An etrog is depicted on the obverse, and two lulav are on the reverse. The larger of the three bronze coins are inscribed "''chatzi''" (half). On the obverse a lulav and etrog are again depicted, with a palm tree and baskets on the reverse.&lt;ref name=virtual/&gt; These coins are sometimes referred to as [[Masada#History|'Masada coins']].

The term formose is a [[portmanteau]] of '''form'''aldehyde and ald'''ose'''.

==Reaction and mechanism==
The reaction is [[catalyzed]] by a [[base (chemistry)|base]] and a divalent metal such as [[calcium]].  The intermediary steps taking place are [[aldol reaction]]s, reverse Aldol reactions, and [[aldose-ketose isomerization]]s. Intermediates are [[glycolaldehyde]], [[glyceraldehyde]],  [[dihydroxyacetone]], and [[tetrose]] sugars.  In 1959, [[Ronald Breslow|Breslow]] proposed a mechanism for the reaction, consisting of the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breslow |first=R. |authorlink= |year=1959 |title=On the Mechanism of the Formose Reaction |journal=Tetrahedron Letters |volume=1 |issue=21 |pages=22–26|doi=10.1016/S0040-4039(01)99487-0|url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction exhibits an induction period, during which only the nonproductive [[Cannizzaro reaction|Cannizzaro disproportionation]] of formaldehyde (to methanol and formate) occurs.  The initial dimerization of formaldehyde to give glycolaldehyde ('''1''') occurs via an unknown mechanism, possibly promoted by light or through a free radical process and is very slow.  However, the reaction is autocatalytic:  '''1''' catalyzes the condensation of two molecules of formaldehyde to produce an additional molecule of '''1'''.  Hence, even a trace (as low as 3 ppm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Socha|first=R. F.|last2=Weiss|first2=A. H.|last3=Sakharov|first3=M. M.|date=1980-07-01|title=Autocatalysis in the formose reaction|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02061275|journal=Reaction Kinetics and Catalysis Letters|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=119–128|doi=10.1007/BF02061275|issn=0133-1736}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of glycolaldehyde is enough to initiate the reaction.  The autocatalytic cycle begins with the aldol reaction of '''1''' with formaldehyde to make glyceraldehyde ('''2'''). An aldose-ketose isomerization of '''2''' forms [[dihydroxyacetone]] ('''3''').  A further aldol reaction of '''3''' with formaldehyde produces tetrulose ('''6'''), which undergoes another ketose-aldose isomerization to form aldotetrose '''7''' (either threose or erythrose).  The retro-aldol reaction of '''7''' generates two molecules of '''1''', resulting in the net production of a molecule of '''1''' from two molecules of formaldehyde, catalyzed by '''1''' itself (autocatalysis).   During this process, '''3''' can also react with '''1''' to form [[ribulose]] ('''4'''), which can isomerize to give rise to [[ribose]] ('''5'''), an important building block of [[RiboNucleic Acid|ribonucleic acid]].

The aldose-ketose isomerization steps are promoted by chelation to calcium.  However, these steps have been shown to proceed through a [[hydride shift]] mechanism by isotope labeling studies, instead of via an intermediate [[Enediol|enediolate]], as previously proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Appayee|first=Chandrakumar|last2=Breslow|first2=Ronald|date=2014-03-12|title=Deuterium Studies Reveal a New Mechanism for the Formose Reaction Involving Hydride Shifts|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ja410886c|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=136|issue=10|pages=3720–3723|doi=10.1021/ja410886c|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The formose reaction is of great importance to the question of the [[Origin of Life|origin of life]] as it explains part of the path from simple [[formaldehyde]] to complex sugars like [[ribose]] and from there to [[RNA]].

[[Image:Four continents.png|thumb|The classical four continents]]

Europeans in the 16th century divided the world into '''four continents''': [[Africa]], [[Americas|America]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Nothing was known of [[Australia (continent)|Australia]], first sighted in the early seventeenth century, or  [[Antarctica]], first sighted in the nineteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the four [[continents]] was seen to represent its quadrant of the world&amp;mdash;Europe in the north, Asia in the east, Africa in the south, and America in the west. This division fit the [[Renaissance]] sensibilities of the time, which also divided the world into four [[season]]s, four [[classical element]]s, four [[cardinal directions]], four classical [[virtues]], etc.

The '''four parts of the world'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ciappara|first=Frans|date=1998|url=http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/4672/1/4672_2141.PDF?UkUDh:CyT|title=Society and inquisition in Malta 1743-1798|publisher=Durhem E-Theses|location=[[Durham University]]|page=38|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the '''four corners of the world''' refers to the [[Americas]] (the "west"), [[Europe]] (the "north"), [[Asia]] (the "east"), and [[Africa]] (the "south"). 

==A three-cornered world==
[[File:Anaximander world map-en.svg|thumb|The ancient tripartite view of the world]]
Before the discovery of the [[New World]] a commonplace of classical and medieval geography had been the "three parts" in which, from Mediterranean and European perspectives, the world was divided: Europe, Asia and Africa. As [[Laurent de Premierfait]], the pre-eminent French translator of Latin literature in the early fifteenth century, informed his readers:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Asia is one of the three parts of the world, which the authors divide in Asia, Africa and Europe. Asia extends towards the [[Orient]] as far as the rising sun (''"devers le [[Levant|souleil levant]]"''&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt;), towards the south ("midi") it ends at the great sea, towards the occident it ends at [[Mare Nostrum|our sea]], and towards the north ("[[septentrional|septentrion]]") it ends in the [[Maeotian marshes]] and the river named ''[[Tanais|Thanaus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Asie est l'une des trois parties du monde que les auteurs divisent en Asie, Afrique et Europe. Asie se extend devers orient jusques a souleil&lt;!--souliel in original: the spelling has been carefully proofread--&gt; [[levant]], devers midi elle fine a la grant mer devers occident elle fine a notre mer, et devers septentrion elle fine aux paluz Meotides et au fleuve appellé Thanaus''; Laurent de Premierfait's expanded translation of [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[De Casibus Virorum Illustrium]]'' (1409), quoted in Patricia M. Gathercole, "Laurent de Premierfait: The Translator of Boccaccio's De casibus virorum illustrium" ''The French Review'' '''27'''.4 (February 1954:245-252) p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Image:EuropaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''Europa:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

==A fourth corner: the enlarged world==
For Laurent's French readers, Asia ended at "our sea", the [[Mediterranean]]; Europeans were only dimly aware of the [[Ural Mountains]], which divide Europe from Asia in the eyes of the modern geographer, and which represent the geological suture between two fragmentary continents, or [[craton]]s. Instead, the division between these continents in the European-centered picture was the [[Hellespont]], which neatly separated Europe from Asia. From the European perspective, into the [[Age of Discovery]], Asia began beyond the Hellespont with [[Asia Minor]], where the Roman province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] had lain, and stretched away to unimaginably exotic and distant places&amp;mdash; "the [[Orient]]".

In the sixteenth century [[Americas|America]] too was full of exotic promise: the "[[New World]]".&lt;ref&gt;This theme is extensively explored in Hugh Honour, ''The New Golden Land: European Images of America from the Discoveries to the Present'' (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1603, [[Cesare Ripa]] published a book of emblems for the use of artists and artisans who might be called upon to depict allegorical figures. He covered an astonishingly wide variety of fields, and his work was reprinted many times. It was still being brought up-to-date in the 18th century. The illustrations reveal fixed Eurocentric perceptions of the nature of the "four corners of the world." Ripa's ''Europe'' (''illustration, left'') is the land of abundance (cornucopia) of kings and the pope, whose crowns and the papal tiara lie at her feet, and of cities.
[[Image:AsiaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Asia:'' woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia,'' 1603]]
''Africa'', by contrast (''illustration, below right'') wears the elephant headdress (worn by rulers depicted on Hellenistic [[Bactria]]n coins) and is accompanied by a lion, the scorpion of the desert sands and [[Cleopatra]]'s [[asp (reptile)|asps]]. ''Asia'' (''illustration, right''), the seat of Religion, carries a smoking [[censer]] as a camel takes its ease.
[[Image:AmericaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|left|100px|''America'', woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]
And the iconic image of ''America'' (''illustration, below left'') shows a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] maiden in a feathered headdress, with [[bow (weapon)|bow]] and arrow. Perhaps she represents a fabled [[Amazons|Amazon]] from the river that already carried the name.

The American millionaire philanthropist [[James Hazen Hyde]], who inherited a majority share in [[The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States|Equitable Life Assurance Society]], formed a collection of allegorical prints illustrating the Four Continents that are now at the [[New-York Historical Society]]; Hyde's drawings and a supporting collection of sets of porcelain table ornaments and other decorative arts illustrating the Four Continents were shared by various [[New York City]] museums.
[[Image:AfricaRipa1603.JPG|thumb|right|100px|''Africa'': woodcut in Ripa's ''Iconologia'' 1603]]

The Renaissance associated one major river to each of the continents.
The Four Rivers theme appears for example in the [[Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi]] in the [[Piazza Navona]] in Rome.

With the confirmed discovery that [[Australia]] was an island continent, the theme of the "Four Continents" lost much of its drive, long before a sixth continent, [[Antarctica]], was discovered. The iconography survived as the '''Four Corners of the World''', however, generally in self-consciously classicizing contexts: for instance, in New York, in front of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] [[Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House]] (1907), four sculptural groups by [[Daniel Chester French]] symbolize the "Four Corners of the World."

[[File:Gedenkstein Kunth Berlin Tegel.JPG|thumb|Memorial plaque for Gottlob Johann Christian Kunth at the entrance to Tegel Castle.]]
'''Gottlob Johann Christian Kunth''' (12 June 1757 in [[Baruth/Mark|Baruth]] – 22 November 1829 in [[Berlin]]) was a German politician and educator. Today he is known above all as the tutor and fatherly friend of the brothers [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Wilhelm]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]].

== Life ==

Kunth was the son of Johann Siegmund Kunth, a senior Protestant minister and hymn writer who died in Baruth in 1779. In 1772, he started attending the upper level of [[Gymnasium (Germany)|gymnasium]] in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]. He then began studying law in [[Leipzig]]. In 1776, however, his financial situation forced him to abandon his studies. He went to work as a private tutor at Tegel Castle, residence of the Humboldt family, in 1777.  [[Marie-Elisabeth von Humboldt]] (née Colomb) engaged him to tutor her sons Wilhelm and Alexander. Kunth, committed to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], instructed the Humboldts in mathematics, German, Latin, Greek, French, and history. He had a lasting influence on their development and planned the future educational paths of both brothers. Kunth arranged private lectures by [[Marcus Herz]], for example, and participation in the literary salons of [[Henriette Herz]] at the famous couple's house.

Kunth was a close confidant of Alexander Georg von Humboldt, the head of the family. After Humboldt's early death in 1779, Kunth assumed the responsibility of  advising his widow, Marie-Elisabeth, and managing her estate. After her death, Kunth served as executor of her will and trustee for her two sons. In addition, he designed the grounds of Tegel Castle.

Wilhelm von Humboldt later advocated for Kunth's appointment to a position with the Prussian statesman and reformer [[Baron vom Stein]]. In 1796, Kunth became trade commissioner of the Prussian State Council. In this position, he became one of the politicians most involved in economic affairs. In 1810, he established the Technical Deputation for Trade and Industry in Berlin and became its director. That same year, he joined the [[Gesetzlose Gesellschaft zu Berlin]], an organization dedicated to the reform of Prussian government and society.

Kunth was buried, according to his wishes, near the tomb of the Humboldt family on the grounds of Tegel Castle. A plaque commemorating Kunth was placed at the entrance to Tegel Castle in 1993. Since January 2006, Kundtanger, a street in the [[Falkenberg (Berlin)|Falkenberg]] locality of Berlin's [[Lichtenberg]] borough, has been named for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berlin.kauperts.de/Strassen/Kundtanger-13057-Berlin#Geschichte |title=Kundtanger |work=Straßennamenlexikon des Luisenstädtischen Bildungsvereins |publisher=Kaupert}} – the spelling ''Kundtanger'' is correct&lt;/ref&gt; The street is located in the development Wohnen am Gehrensee, where several streets bear the names of friends and associates of the Humboldt family.

== Family ==

*Parents: Johann Sigismund Kunth (1700–1779) and Friederike Juliane Hausherr (1723–1804)
*Married in 1806: Margaretha Marawiakowska (in some sources: Malgorzata Mankwiatowska) (1783?–1863)
*Children: Adelheid Sigismunde Elisabeth Kunth (1808–1834), Bertha Kunth (1810–1879), Heinrich Kunth (1811–1850), Adalbert Sigismund Ernst Kunth (1814–1858)
*Nephew: [[Karl Sigismund Kunth]] (1788–1850), a botanist who devoted much of his career to evaluating the samples gathered by Alexander von Humboldt and [[Aimé Bonpland]] during their expedition to [[Latin America]].

'''Historic site''' or '''Heritage site''' is an official location where pieces of political, military, cultural, or social [[history]] have been preserved due to their [[cultural heritage]] value. Historic sites are usually protected by law, and many have been recognized with the official '''national historic site''' status. A historic site may be any building, landscape, site or structure that is of local, regional, or national significance.

==Historic site visitors==
Historic sites and heritage sites are often maintained for members of the public to be able to visit. Visitors may come out of a sense of [[nostalgia]] for bygone eras, out of wishing to learn about their [[cultural heritage]], or general interest in learning about the historical context of the site.&lt;ref name="Alderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alderson|first1=William T.|last2=Low|first2=Shirley Payne|title=Interpretation of Historic Sites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N2ww-P1suYIC|date=1985-01-01|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780761991625}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LevyLloyd2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Levy|first1=Barbara Abramoff|last2=Lloyd|first2=Sandra Mackenzie|last3=Schreiber|first3=Susan Porter|title=Great Tours!: Thematic Tours and Guide Training for Historic Sites|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NU4eAAAAQBAJ|date=7 February 2002|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=9780759116757|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sites offer guided tours for visitors,&lt;ref name="LevyLloyd2002" /&gt; conducted by site staff who have been trained to offer an interpretation of life at the time the site represents.&lt;ref&gt;Metin Kozak, Luisa Andreu, ''Progress in Tourism Marketing'' (2013), p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; A site may also have a [[visitor center]] with more modern architecture and facilities, which serves as a gateway between the outside world and the historic site, and allows visitors to learn some of the historical aspects of the site without excessively exposing locations that may require delicate treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Jafari|first2=Aliakbar|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Keeping your audience: Presenting a visitor engagement scale|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tourman.2013.12.011|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.12.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''history of parliamentary procedure''' refers to the origins and evolution of [[parliamentary law]] used by [[deliberative assembly|deliberative assemblies]].

== Origins ==
''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure|Demeter's Manual]]'' traces the origins of parliamentary law, by which is meant orderly deliberation and action by an assembly of persons or a body of citizens, to c. 750 BC in Greece. It was during that era that the idea of [[self-government]], with the right to deliberate in assembly and to speak and vote on public questions, was conceived. The Greeks instituted the Athenian [[agora]], equivalent to the American [[town meeting]], consisting of the whole body of male citizens above eighteen years of age, which met forty times each year on the [[Acropolis]]. Any citizen could address the meeting from the [[Bema]] and vote on questions before the assembly.

Circa 450 BC, the Romans adopted the concept of self-government and expanded it with the institution of the [[Roman Forum]], where Roman orators addressed the General Assembly from the [[Rostra]] and the people afterward voted on pending questions.&lt;ref name=DemIntro&gt;{{cite parl|title=DEM|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anglo-Saxon tribes ==
According to ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' (RONR), one commonly held view is that "our own tradition of parliamentary process may be traced to ways of life in Anglo-Saxon tribes before their migration to the island of Britain starting in the fifth century A.D. Among these peoples on the continent of Europe, the tribe was the largest regularly existing political unit."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = xxxi|edition = 11th|ref = harv|display-authors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the early Anglo-Saxon kingdoms had its own [[witenagemot]], which was a national assembly consisting of freemen who owned land.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The structure of the Anglo-Saxon governmental machinery was left largely intact even after the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, with the Norman kings assembling a "Great Council" of court officials, barons, and prelates that was constitutionally a continuation of the witenagemot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early parliament ==
In the 13th and early 14th centuries, the [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] was converted into the [[English Parliament]]. The distinguishing feature of these early parliaments was that the barons were invited to not only express their opinions individually to the king, but to discuss with each other the business "of king and kingdom" rather than only "the king's business." The earliest parliament clearly identifiable as of this character was held in 1258. It was during the Thirteenth century that the rules of parliamentary law started taking form as a science.&lt;ref name="DemIntro" /&gt; The [[clerk of the House of Commons]] began writing the [[Journal of the House of Commons]] on his own initiative in 1547, which became a source of precedent in parliamentary procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = xxxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Legislative Procedure: Parliamentary Practices and the Course of Business'' notes that "many usages were crystallized, so to speak, by the ruling of a Speaker or by some formal action of Parliament, such as a resolution or simple vote."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Legislative Procedure: Parliamentary Practices and the Course of Business|author=Luce, Robert|year=1922|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early United States ==
British parliamentary procedures were carried over to the American colonies and became the foundations of legislative procedure in the U.S. states. [[Jefferson's Manual]], published in 1801, recognized indebtedness to [[John Hatsell]]'s ''[[Precedents of Proceedings in the House of Commons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manual of Parliamentary Practice|author=Jefferson, Thomas|year=1801|pages=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], parliamentary procedure was perfected into a system which was described in the U.S. House ''Rules and Manual'' thus:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rules and Manual|author=Deschler, Lewis|publisher=U.S. House|pages=vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|They are perhaps the most finely adjusted, scientifically balanced,and highly technical rules of any parliamentary body in the world. Under them a majority may work its will at all times in the face of the most determined and vigorous opposition of a minority}}

The development of parliamentary law was similar to that of the [[common law]]. ''[[Mason's Manual]]'' notes that parliamentary law was built on precedents created by decisions on [[points of order]] or [[appeal (motion)|appeals]] and by decisions of courts. It was guided in its development by the authority to make rules inherent in every deliberative body. The common law of parliamentary procedure, however, did not rest upon mere custom but upon reasonable and equitable custom. ''Mason's Manual'' notes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite parl|title=MAS|pages=33–34|edition=2000|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|The state legislatures and local governmental bodies copied from Congress. However, the procedure of the state legislatures, local legislative bodies and voluntarily associations now differs greatly from the procedure of Parliament and Congress. While Congress is governed largely by rules adopted by the houses of Congress to meet their local and special needs, the states legislatures &amp;ndash; and particularly, the more local bodies, both public and private &amp;ndash; are governed by a branch of the common law based upon court decisions and upon precedents and customs of deliberative bodies.}}

== 20th century to present ==
By the beginning of the 20th century, ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]'', had been almost universally adopted by ordinary societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.usace.army.mil/About/History/HistoricalVignettes/GeneralHistory/038ChurchMeetings.aspx|title = Historical Vignette 038 - An Army Engineer Brought Order to Church Meetings|date = November 2001|accessdate = 2015-12-03|website = |publisher = U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Office of History|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, [[Alice Sturgis]] published the ''Sturgis Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure'', later revised in 2001 by AIP as ''[[The Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure]]'', arguing that organizations need not continue operating under 19th century rules, and that it would be better to go with a simpler set of rules. In 1969 [[George Demeter]] published  ''[[Demeter's Manual of Parliamentary Law and Procedure]], Blue Book Edition'', that was longer and more in-depth than the then current version of ''Robert's Rules of Order Revised'' (ROR). In the 21st century, the latest editions of ''[[Robert's Rules of Order|Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised]]'' included coverage of current practices such as electronic meetings and sending communication by electronic means such as e-mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|pp = xxvi-xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Carochi.jpg|210px|right|thumb|Frontispiece of Carochis "Arte de la Lengva Mexicana con la declaración de los adverbios della"]]

'''Horacio Carochi''' (1586–1666) was a [[Jesuit]] priest and grammarian who was born in [[Florence]] and died in [[Mexico]]. He is known for his grammar of the [[Classical Nahuatl]] language.

== Life==
Carochi was born in Florence. He went to [[Rome]] where he entered the [[Society of Jesus]]. From Rome he went to the [[New World]], arriving in [[New Spain]] (now [[Mexico]]). There he dedicated himself to the study of the indigenous languages and became proficient in [[Otomi language|Otomi]] and then in [[Nahuatl]]. He was a friend of the Bishop and later [[Viceroy of New Spain]], [[Juan de Palafox y Mendoza]], as is documented by surviving letters written by Carochi to the bishop.

==Importance==
Carochi had an acute understanding of the Nahuatl language and was the first grammarian to understand and propose a consistent transcription of two difficult phenomena in Nahuatl [[phonology]], namely vowel length and the [[saltillo (linguistics)|saltillo]]. His ''Arte'' or grammar was seen as important soon after its publication, and as early as 1759 a version edited by [[Ignacio Paredes]] was issued. This version, however, lacks most of the virtues of the original work.

His original ''[[Arte de la Lengua Mexicana con la declaración de los adverbios della|Arte de la lengua Mexicana]]'' is considered by linguists today to be the finest and most useful of the extant early grammars of Nahuatl. He also wrote a grammar of Otomi, which is now lost.

==Works==

Of the works of Carochi, only the ''Arte de la lengua Mexicana'' has been printed; the others exist only in manuscript form.

[[Image:legwarmers1.jpg|thumb|right|Leg warmers worn as fashion pieces.]]
'''Leg warmers''' are coverings for the lower legs, similar to socks but thicker and generally footless. Leg warmers are worn to keep the lower legs warm in colder weather. They can be tubular sleeves, long fabric wrappings, or simple pieces of fur or fabric tied around the calves. They are used in several outdoor activities and sports including cycling, soccer, hockey, hiking, ice skating, and dance.

They are used as [[dancewear]] by [[ballet]] and other classic dancers in order to keep the leg muscles warm and to prevent cramping or other muscle injuries. No scientific data has been yet collected to substantiate the claim that leg warmers prevent injury.

Traditionally knitted from pure sheep wool, modern variants are more typically made of cotton, [[synthetic fiber]]s, or both. Some are made of other materials, such as [[Chenille fabric|chenille]].

Leg warmers can vary in length, and in width, due to the material's stretchiness. They are commonly worn between the ankle to just below the knee, though many dancers prefer it to extend to cover the lower parts of the thigh. Some cover the entire foot—these "warmers" usually have a pad that grips the floor so the dancer does not slip—however this has been known to cause career-ending injury.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Some leg warmers are particularly short and made of thinner material; these are also known as "ankle warmers".

Originally worn by dancers to keep their muscles from cramping after stretching, in the early 1980s leg warmers became a [[fad]] and wearing them was fashionable among teenage girls; later to be an adopted fashion by boys in the city of Berkeley in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].  Their popularity was partly due to the influence of the films ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' and ''[[Flashdance]]'' and the concurrent [[aerobics]] craze.  They were worn with leggings, jeans, and tights or as part of aerobic wear. They were very popular in 1980's all over the world.

Recently,{{When|date=October 2018}} leg warmers have become popular with new parents as a way to keep babies and toddlers warm while making it easy to change diapers.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} They also have become popular again with girls, tweens, teens, college students and women. They are worn over leggings, tights or jeans and then a pair of [[riding boots]] is worn and the leg warmers are slouched at the top of the [[riding boots]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

'''Louis Viardot''' ({{IPA-fr|lwi vjaʁ.do|pron}}; July 31, 1800 in [[Dijon]], France{{spaced ndash}}May 5, 1883 in Paris, France) was a French writer, art historian, art critic, theatrical figure, and translator. As a translator, he mostly contributed to the development of Russian and Spanish literature in France.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;

==Biography==
Viardot was born in a provincial family, his father was a liberal lawyer from [[Dijon]]. His father died early and left his wife with five children in poverty. Viardot had to make his own way. His first job was as a bar trail then he worked as a journalist.&lt;ref name=neva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazines.russ.ru/neva/2012/11/c14.html|author= Irina Tchaikovsky|title=Полина Виардо: возможность дискуссии|trans-title=Pauline Viardot: the ability to debate|accessdate=20 December 2016|work=[[Neva (magazine)|Neva]]|via=magazines.russ.ru|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Viardot was 18 years old, he left [[Dijon]] to study law in [[Paris]].

When he was in Paris in 1823, he started his job as a journalist. When he was twenty-three years old, he joined the french army and was deployed to Spain, during which the French army restored the monarchy there. He learned Spanish and acquainted himself with the country's history and culture. Subsequently he translated "[[Don Quixote]]" of [[Cervantes]] to French.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;

===George Sand and Viardot family===
Viardot worked for the newspaper ''[[Le Globe]]'' (1828) alongside [[Pierre Leroux]], who introduced him to [[George Sand]].

In 1836 Viardot, who was already a friend of the artist [[Ary Scheffer]], served as the attorney of [[Maria Malibran]] and managed her affairs. Her marriage with Eugene Malibran was terminated in 1836 with his help. [[Maria Malibran]] was the oldest sister of his future spouse [[Pauline Garcia-Viardot|Pauline Garcia]] (1821-1910). 1836 г. [[Pauline Viardot|Pauline Garcia]], sister of [[Maria Malibran]], met [[George Sand]] in 1836. Due to [[George Sand]] already knowing Louis Viardot, Louis Viardot and his friend [[Ary Scheffer]] met [[Pauline Viardot|Pauline Garcia]], the sister of [[Maria Malibran]] and future wife of Louis, in 1836.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epitafii.ru/necrolog/polina_viardo.html Некролог Полине Виардо]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, after the fire in the [[Théâtre italien de Paris|Théâtre italien in Paris (Salle Favare)]], Louis together with Robert, served as the  director of the theater.

Viardot married [[Pauline Garcia-Viardot|Pauline Garcia]] on 16 April 1840. He was twenty-one years older than his wife and loved her until his death.

He had Republican political views, did not believe in God, loved hunting and hunting dogs. He said that he had uttered the words "Long live the king!" only once, when he had received an invitation to a Royal hunt.&lt;ref name="neva" /&gt;

He abandoned the position of director of the [[Théâtre italien de Paris|Théâtre italien in Paris]], to devote himself to the career of his wife, and would follow her on her tours.&lt;ref name="neva" /&gt;

In 1841, Louis Viardot, together with [[Pierre Leroux]] and [[George Sand]], founded the socialist newspaper ''La Revue Indépendante'', which was published for a short period.

===Ary Scheffer and Viardot family===
Scheffer and Viardot were familiar and friendly in the 1830s, before Viardot's marriage. They were friends when Viardot defended the interests of [[Maria Malibran]], the sister of his future wife, and [[George Sand]] during the trial in 1836.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;
[[File:Ary Scheffer Self-portrait Rijksmuseum SK A 4748.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Self-portrait'' (circa 1838) by Scheffer]]

At various times [[Maurice Sand]], [[Ary Scheffer]], [[Charles Gounod]], [[Hector Berlioz]] were in relationships with [[Pauline Viardot]]. In their letters they claimed that they were in love with her.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt; She wrote in one letter:
{{quote|''Louis and Scheffer have always been my dearest of friends, and it is sad, that I was never able to respond to the hot and deep love of Louis, despite all my volition.''&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;}}

The "evil tongues" connected the birth of the daughter Claudia (Claudie) in the Viardot family with the name of [[Gounod]] and said that he was the father of Claudia, who was born on 20 of May, 1852. The oldest daughter Louise was ten years older than the new born Claudie. Whether [[Gounod]] is father of Claudie or not remains a mystery. He behaved strangely, but in keeping with his nature of promanage-polysurfaces. [[Ivan Turgenev]] called [[Gounod]] "erotic Holy father" on French language. Viardot family was not invited to the wedding of [[Gounod]] and Viardot family sent wedding present only and the problem was started. Scheffer was a confidant of [[Pauline Viardot]] in this questions.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;

Scheffer was a confidant of [[Pauline Viardot]] and a friend of Viardot family all his life.&lt;ref name=neva/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Kendall-Davis. The life and work of Pauline Viardot Garsia. Vol. 1 The years of Fame. 1836–1863. Cambridge Scholars Press, 2003, 2004. P. 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Viardot was paralyzed by a stroke and remained housebound until his death in 1883.

'''Markus Casey''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Archaeologist]], 1957-2008.

Casey was born in [[Dublin]] and educated in [[Galway]]. He graduated with an Honors Degree in Archaeology and Classical Civilization. His work in aerial photography demonstrated how such study should be undertaken in the modern era, as his research demonstrated that dozens of Irish [[ring forts]] and other sites - many previously unknown - were not included on the Ordnance Survey Maps of Ireland, which still regarded as crucial for any Irish archaeologist.

He was killed in plane crash at [[Kilmovee]], [[County Mayo]], in 2008, survived by ''"his twelve year old son, Tim, his mother Erika, his brother and sisters, and his good friend Eithne.''

'''Michaël Eytzinger''' ('''[[Freiherr]] Michael von Aitzing''', '''Aitzinger''', '''Eyzinger''', or '''[[Eitzing]]''') (born ca. 1530 in [[Eitzing|Obereitzing]] - died 1598 in [[Bonn]]), was an [[Austria]]n [[nobleman]], [[diplomat]], [[historian]], and [[publicist]], who wrote and published several works, including a renowned volume that states the principles of a [[genealogical numbering system]], called an [[Ahnentafel]], that is still in use today. 

Eytzinger first published the [[Ahnentafel]] in 1590 in his ''Thesaurus principum hac aetate in Europa viventium'' ([[Cologne]]),&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uTo8AAAAcAAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s ''Thesaurus Principum hac Aetate In Europa Viventium''], 1591, (Google eBook)(Full Preview)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ESazQAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Thesaurus+principum+hac+aetate+in+Europa+viventium&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=11XHTumeCe7EmQWnj90S&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAQ ''Thesaurus Principum hac aetate in Europa viventium''], 1590 (Google Books)(No Preview)&lt;/ref&gt; in which he described and illustrated his new functional theory of numeration of ancestors by providing genealogies of thirty-four sovereign houses of Europe. 

[[Ahnentafel|Eytzinger’s method]] was used by [[Jeronimo de Sosa|Jerónimo de Sosa]], in his work ''Noticia de la gran casa de los marqueses de Villafranca'' in 1676, and was popularized by [[Stephan Kekulé von Stradonitz]] in his ''Ahnentafel-atlas'' in 1898.

He also wrote and published several histories, including ''Novus de Leone Belgico'' in 1583 that included the first cartographic representation of the [[Low Countries]] as [[Leo Belgicus]]. The lion motif was inspired by the heraldic figures that appear in the coats of arms of several Dutch constituencies, as well as in the arms of William of Orange. The map was published during the period when the [[Netherlands]] was fighting the [[Eighty Years' War]] for independence from Spain.

'''Mikhail Vladimirovich Alpatov''' ({{lang-ru|Михаил Владимирович Алпатов}},  10 December 1902, [[Moscow]] - 9 May 1986, Moscow) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian and [[Art|art theorist]], notable for his contribution to the history of the [[culture of ancient Rus]].&lt;ref name="enc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Соколов|first=М.Н. |title=Культурология. XX век.|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_culture/200/%D0%90%D0%9B%D0%9F%D0%90%D0%A2%D0%9E%D0%92|year=1998|language=Russian|publisher=Энциклопедия}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Alpatov graduated from [[Moscow State University|Moscow University]], where he studied the history of arts from 1919 and 1921. Subsequently, he worked at the [[Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Moscow, and, from 1923 to 1930, in the Institute of Archeology and Art History of the Academy of Sciences. In 1943 he became a professor at the [[Surikov State Institute of Arts]], also in Moscow. In 1954, he became a member of the [[USSR Academy of Art]]. He died in 1986.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;

==Work==
Beginning in the 1920s, Alpatov was primarily engaged in researching the culture and art of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and of ancient Rus. Later, he also turned to the Renaissance, and to the general theory of culture. He advocated that art history is a reflection of history itself, a kind of "applied history". He discovered deep connections between old Russian art, in particular, [[Andrei Rublev]], and Byzantine and Greek art.&lt;ref name="enc"/&gt;

'''Neo-primitivism''' was a Russian [[art movement]] which took its name from the 31-page pamphlet ''Neo-primitivizm'', by [[Aleksandr Shevchenko|Aleksandr]] {{harvtxt|Shevchenko|1913}}. In the pamphlet Shevchenko proposes a new style of modern painting which fuses elements of [[Cézanne]], [[Cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|Futurism]] with traditional Russian '[[folk art]]' conventions and motifs, notably the [[russian icon]] and the [[lubok]].

*[[David Burlyuk]]
*[[Marc Chagall]]
*[[Pavel Filonov]]

Old Harlow is situated in the north-east area of the town and is the oldest area of the town. Old Harlow pre-dates the first written record in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, so it is unknown when the town first came into existence. Originally Old Harlow was going to be the central area of Harlow New Town, but due to the amount of demolition works and the loss of agricultural land it was decided to build Harlow New Town to the west of Old Harlow. As Harlow New Town was being built, Old Harlow seemed to be forgotten and fell behind in its development. It was not until 1977 that Old Harlow was improved with the building of a health service and a senior citizens day centre. Old Harlow still remains village-like with two Grade I [[listed buildings]] and many Grade II listed buildings.

Old Harlow ward has a total population of 5,845 and comprises 2,498 homes.&lt;ref name=wardprofile /&gt;

==History==
Old Harlow was known as Harlow before the building of [[Harlow#The New Town|Harlow New Town]], at which point it was renamed Old Harlow and became a [[Wards of the United Kingdom|ward]] of the [[New town#United Kingdom|new town]]. 

High Street has an independent electronic component distributor, Post Office [http://www.store-opening-times.co.uk/post-office-london-road-harlow] two Indian restaurants, a Chinese restaurant, a chip and kebab shop and a two daytime Cafés.

Opposite High Street runs Fore Street and Market Street, where there are three of the ''Old Town'' pubs, the Chequers, the Marquis of Granby [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/305526] and the Crown [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/497517]. The Crown has a wall of medieval painting, dating back to the 17th century.

At the other end of High Street a short walk takes you to the Green Man Hotel [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/275363].

The town is served by Harlow Baptist Church and [[St Mary &amp; St Hugh, Old Harlow|St Mary's Church]]. The town also contains a small extension campus of [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]], Canada.

===Historic estates===
====Harlowbury====
The former [[manor]] of [[Harlowbury]] lies immediately to the north-east of the town. It was for a time a seat of the Addington family.&lt;ref&gt;A Brief History of Harlowbury Manor{{cite web |url=http://www.cm17.net/archive/a-brief-history-of-harlowbury-manor |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20141007223116/http://www.cm17.net/archive/a-brief-history-of-harlowbury-manor |archivedate=2014-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An ancient chapel survives on the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/148814]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
===Bus===
Most bus services operate to nearby [[Harlow]], with some buses also linking to other major towns such as [[Bishop's Stortford]] and [[Chelmsford]]. Most routes are operated under contract to Essex County Council (routes 7, 8A, 12, 47, 59, 147, 322), but some routes are operated commercially (routes 8, 510, 511, E18). Route 510 is the most frequent service, offering links to [[Harlow]], [[Sawbridgeworth]], [[Bishops Stortford]] and [[Stansted Airport]] 24-hours a day, including Christmas Day.

[[Image:Peter Rochegune Munch.jpg|thumb|right|Peter Rochegune Munch]]

'''Peter Rochegune Munch''' (in Danish usually referred to as ''P. Munch'') (1870–1948) was a leading [[Denmark|Danish]] [[historian]] and [[politician]]. He was a leading member of the ''[[Det Radikale Venstre|Radikale Venstre]]'', and represented [[Langeland]] in parliament.

As [[Foreign Minister of Denmark]] from 1929 to 1940, he greatly influenced Danish foreign policy well beyond his own time in office. However, his role in the years leading to the [[German occupation of Denmark]] has ensured that his legacy remains controversial.

== Background and private life ==
Peter Munch was an illegitimate child, growing up without a father in a small provincial town. The family was quite poor, and from an early age he had to work to help out his mother. He quickly showed great skill in school, and his mother decided to put him through high school, although this placed a great strain on their finances.

After having completed [[national service]] Munch attended studies at [[University of Copenhagen]]. Being without private means he worked in several jobs to support himself throughout his study time. He graduated with a first-class degree in history in 1895, and achieved a doctoral degree in 1900, writing a thesis on Danish local government in the 16th Century.

Around this time he married the well-known [[feminist]] [[Elna Munch|Elna Sarauw]] with whom he would have one son. By nature Munch was very introvert, and not one who would easily connect with other people. He insisted on always using the most formal forms of address, and even with friends he didn't use first-names. This is also the reason why he became known only as P. Munch. His work ethic was, however, second to none, and his output in terms of books, pamphlets, articles (both academic and for newspapers), letters, diaries and other notes, is immense.

== Ideas and influences ==

As an [[historian]] Munch was an advocate of the inclusion of [[social sciences]] in primary school history lessons [http://udd.uvm.dk/200310/udd200310-01.htm?menuid=4515]. He was also the author of several textbooks on Danish and World history, some of which were published in more than 15 editions, and remained in use well into the 1960s. As an academic historian Munch belonged to the [[positivist]] tradition, which held sway in Denmark during his lifetime. The income from his vast production of textbooks and other academic works finally lifted him out of poverty, and allowed him to pursue a political career.

P. Munch had been deeply influenced by the thinking of [[Viggo Hørup]], especially on matters of foreign and security policy. Hørup had been deeply shaken by the ease of the German victory in the [[Second War of Schleswig]], and had once famously remarked during a parliamentary debate on the Danish armed forces: "What's the use of it all?" ("Hvad skal det nytte?").

Following from this kind of thought Munch thus considered a territorial defence of Denmark impossible, and illusions about this downright dangerous. All Denmark could hope for would be to maintain good relations with the great powers, Germany first and foremost among them, and to avoid confrontation at all cost. These ideas stayed with him throughout his political career, and he would manage to stamp them quite firmly on Danish Foreign Policy.

It was thus natural for him to be one of the founders of [[Det Radikale Venstre]] the (''Danish Social Liberal Party''), which has always had a strong pacifist streak, and to be one of the authors of the new party's [[Odense Program]] in 1905. Due to his intellect and work capacity Munch soon rose to be one of the leading members of the new party. He was elected to parliament ([[Folketinget]]) in 1905, and would retain his seat until 1943.

== Early career 1905–1929==

In 1909 Radikale Venstre formed its first government, and Munch became [[List of Interior Ministers of Denmark|Minister of the Interior]]. He didn't have much impact in this position, as the government was ousted already after 10 months in office.

The second time the party formed a government, again under the leadership of [[Carl Theodor Zahle]], Munch became [[List of Defence Ministers of Denmark|Minister of Defence]]. His long period in this office coincided with [[World War I]]. Denmark remained neutral throughout, which was entirely in accordance with the views of P. Munch and the foreign minister, [[Erik Scavenius]]. However many, including the [[King Christian X]], considered Munch to be too soft on defence to hold this position during a time of crisis. But Munch stayed put, and loyally - indeed ironically, given his own bleak assessment of the feasibility of any territorial defence—oversaw the largest peacetime mobilisation in Danish history, as it had been envisaged in the Defence Bill of 1909.

Munch's influence in the government reached beyond his brief as defence minister. Because of his seemingly endless stamina in negotiations with other parties, his mastery of even the most complex brief, and his ice-cold temper, he often represented the government when difficult compromises had to be reached over both normal legislation and matters relating to the war.

The government was finally pushed out of office during the [[Easter Crisis of 1920]], and over the following years most of the leading lights of the Zahle government retired from politics. Munch on the other hand remained active, and by 1926 he had become the party's undisputed leader. During this time he worked to prevent any rapprochement between Radikale Venstre and [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], the party they had originally split from. Instead he gave tacit support to the first social democratic government, which sat from 1924 to 1926.

In 1929 Munch and Radikale Venstre delivered the crucial votes to bring down [[Thomas Madsen-Mygdal]]'s Venstre government during the debate on the state budget. In the following election the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] and Radikale Venstre achieved an outright majority, and subsequently entered into one of the most successful and durable coalitions in Danish political history.

== Foreign minister 1929–1940==
A commonplace saying during the long rule of the Social Democratic/Radical coalition was that [[Prime Minister]] [[Thorvald Stauning]] handled domestic policy, while P. Munch was solely in charge of foreign policy. This was simplified, of course, as a high degree of agreement existed between the two in both spheres of policy.

In domestic politics the government tackled the world economic crisis by introducing currency controls, and through a comprehensive economic crisis package agreed with [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] in the early months of 1933. At the same time a series of social reforms were carried out, which laid the earliest foundations that today's [[welfare state]] would be built upon. These reforms created a rudimentary [[social safety net]], and did much to lessen the appeal of [[totalitarian]] and anti-democratic political movements during the crisis years. The government also enacted a new criminal code in 1930, which abolished [[capital punishment]] and de-criminalised [[homosexuality]], and which, although amended many times, remains in force today.

The coalition was re-elected with solid majorities in 1933, 1936, and 1939. However an attempt in 1939 to modify the Constitution failed in a referendum.

However, Munch's influence was arguably greatest on the conduct of Denmark's foreign relations.

Munch's main political goal was (unilateral) disarmament and the preservation of Danish neutrality. He served as a delegate to the [[League of Nations]] from 1920 to 1938. [https://web.archive.org/web/20051116061246/http://users.cybercity.dk/~nmb13034/Kanslerg.html]

== Last years ==

P. Munch's last years were not happy ones. As the occupation wore on, and especially after the liberation in 1945 his record as foreign minister came under severe attack from many sides. In late 1945 he had to subject to the indignity of prolonged interrogation by a Parliamentary Committee set up to investigate the circumstances surrounding the occupation. Up until his death in 1948 there were repeated suggestions that he should be put on trial for negligence (and even treason). However, when the parliamentary commission delivered its final report in 1953, Munch was largely exonerated.

This did not, though, stop the continued blaming of Munch for the situation Denmark had been in. His policies were largely disowned by the political elite (his own Radical party the only exception). 'Never again a 9 April' ('Aldrig mere en 9. April') became a mantra for Danish politicians, and gradually a new bipartisan consensus emerged between the Liberals, Conservatives and Social Democrats regarding Danish foreign and security policy, which would lead to membership of [[NATO]] in 1949.

== The Rostock Myth==
Danish historian [[Jon Galster]] claimed P. Munch visited the German town of Rostock just a few weeks before the German occupation and met with several Nazi dignitaries, [[Heinrich Himmler]] among them. According to Galster, Munch had been warned in advance about the German intentions towards Denmark, and had agreed to making the occupation happen as peacefully as possible. This would supposedly account for the limited Danish response on April 9, 1940, and Munch's own willingness to surrender once the invasion was under way. In 1990, Galster published the book ''9. april - en sand myte'' ('9 April, a true myth'), detailing his theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galster.dk/slaegten/jongalster.htm Jon Galster&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Richard John Evans''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FRSL|FRHistS|FLSW}} (born 29 September 1947), is a British historian of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Europe with a focus on Germany. He is the author of eighteen books, including his three-volume ''[[The Third Reich Trilogy]]'' (2003–2008) that has been hailed as "brilliant" and "magisterial." Evans was [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of History]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] from 2008 until his retirement in 2014, and President of Cambridge's [[Wolfson College, Cambridge|Wolfson College]] from 2010 to 2017. He has been Provost of [[Gresham College]] in London since 2014.
Evans was appointed [[Knight Bachelor]] for services to scholarship in the [[2012 Birthday Honours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=60173 |date=16 June 2012 |page=1 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/honours-list/9335524/Queens-birthday-Honours-list-in-full.html|title=Queen's birthday Honours list in full|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=2012-06-16|date=2012-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Evans was born at [[Woodford, London|Woodford]], [[Essex]], of Welsh parentage and was educated at [[Forest School (Walthamstow)|Forest School]], [[Jesus College, Oxford]] (MA), and [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] (DPhil). In a 2004 interview, he stated that frequent visits to Wales during his childhood inspired both an interest in history and a sense of "otherness".&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; He also said that one reason that he was drawn to the study modern German history in the late 1960s was his identification of parallels between the [[Vietnam War]] and German imperialism.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; He admired the work of [[Fritz Fischer]], whom he credits with inspiring him to study modern German history.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt;

==Historian of Germany==
Evans first established his academic reputation with his publications on the [[German Empire]]. In the early 1970s, Evans travelled to Germany to research his dissertation, a study of the feminist movement in Germany in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; It was later published as ''The Feminist Movement In Germany, 1894–1933'' in 1976. Evans followed his study of German [[feminism]] by another book, ''The Feminists'' (1977), which traced the history of the feminist movement in North America, Australasia and Europe from 1840 to 1920.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; A theme of both books was the weakness of German middle-class culture and its susceptibility to the appeal of nationalism.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; Evans argued that both liberalism and feminism failed in Germany for those reasons despite flourishing elsewhere in the [[Western world]]&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt;

Evans' main interest is [[social history]], and he is much influenced by the [[Annales School]].&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; He largely agrees with Fischer that 19th-century German social development paved the way for the rise of [[Nazi Germany]], but Evans takes pains to point out that many other possibilities could have happened.&lt;ref&gt;"Searching for an explanation of the origins and rise of Nazism in German history inevitably runs the risk of making the whole process seem inevitable. At almost every turn, however, things might have been different. The triumph of Nazism was far from a foregone conclusion right up to the early months of 1933. Yet it was no historical accident, either." Evans, Richard J. ''The Coming of the Third Reich'' 2004 pages xxvii–xviii&lt;/ref&gt; For Evans, the values of the 19th-century German middle class contained the already germinating seeds of [[Nazism|National Socialism]].&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt;

Evans studied under Fischer in Hamburg in 1970 and 1971 but came to disagree with the "[[Bielefeld School]]" of historians, who argued for the ''[[Sonderweg]]'' thesis that saw the roots of Germany’s political development in the first half of the 20th century in a "[[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|failed bourgeois revolution]]" in 1848. Following a contemporary trend that opposed the previous "great man" theory of history, Evans was a member of a group of young British historians who in the 1970s sought to examine German history during the German Empire "from below".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hamerow |first=Theodore S. |title=Guilt, Redemption and Writing German History |pages=53–72 [p. 70] |journal=[[The American Historical Review]] |year=1983 |volume=88 |issue=1 |jstor=1869345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars highlighted "the importance of the grass-roots of politics and the everyday life and experience of ordinary people".&lt;ref name="Evans pages 22"&gt;Evans, Richard "Introduction: Wilhelm II's Germany and the Historians" from ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'' London: Croom Helm, 1978 pages 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; "History is about people, and their relationships. It’s about the perennial question of ‘how much free will do people have in building their own lives, and making a future," Evans has said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historyextra.com/feature/culture/%E2%80%9Ci-worry-view-people-have-past-becoming-narrower%E2%80%9D-interview-sir-richard-j-evans Sir Richard Evans interviewed by Emma Mason in the BBC magazine ''HistoryExtra''.]&lt;/ref&gt; He says he supported the creation of a "new school of people's history", which was a result of a trend that "has taken place across a whole range of historical subjects, political opinions, and methodological approaches and has been expressed in many different ways".&lt;ref name="Evans pages 22"/&gt;

In 1978, as editor of a collection of essays by young British historians entitled ''Society And Politics In Wilhelmine Germany'', he launched a critique of the ‘top-down’ approach of the Bielefeld School associated with [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and [[Jürgen Kocka]] in regards to the [[German Empire#Wilhelmine era|Wilhelmine Germany]]. With the historians [[Geoff Eley]] and [[David Blackbourn]], Evans instead emphasized the "self-mobilization from below" of key sociopolitical groups, as well as the modernity of National Socialism. In the 1980s, Evans organized ten international workshops on modern German social history at the [[University of East Anglia]] that did a good deal to refine these ideas, to pioneer research in this new historical field and, in six collections of papers, present it to an Anglophone readership.&lt;ref&gt;See Richard Evans, In Defence of History, London, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among Evans' major research works are ''Death in Hamburg'' (1987), a study of class conflict and liberal government in 19th-century Germany using the example of [[Hamburg’s cholera epidemics]] and applying statistical methods to the exploration of social inequality in an industrializing society, and ''Rituals of Retribution'' (1996), a study of [[capital punishment]] in German history applying structural anthropological concepts to the rituals of public execution up to the mid-19th century and exploring the politics of the [[death penalty]] until its abolition by [[East Germany]] in 1987. In ''Death in Hamburg'', Evans studied the [[cholera]] outbreak in [[Hamburg]] in 1892, which he concluded was caused by a failure in the medical system to safeguard against such an event.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; Another study in German social history was ''Tales from the German Underworld'' (1998), where Evans traced the life stories of four German criminals in the late 19th century, namely a homeless woman, a forger, a prostitute and a conman.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; In ''Rituals of Retribution'', Evans traced the history of [[capital punishment in Germany]], and using the ideas of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Philippe Ariès]] and [[Norbert Elias]] as his guide argued that opposition to the death penalty was strongest when liberalism was in the ascendancy, and support for capital punishment coincided when the right was in the ascendancy.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; Thus, in Evans' view, capital punishment in Germany was never a mere matter of law being disinterestedly applied but was rather a form of state power being exercised.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt; In addition, Evans examined such subjects as belief in witchcraft, torture, the last words of the executed, the psychology of mobs, varying forms of execution from the [[Thirty Years War]] to the 1980s, profiles of executioners, cruelty, and changing views towards the death penalty.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt;

In the 1980s, Evans was a conspicuous figure in the ''[[Historikerstreit]]'', a controversy surrounding the historical work and theories of German historians [[Ernst Nolte]], [[Joachim Fest]], [[Andreas Hillgruber]], [[Michael Stürmer]], [[Hagen Schulze]], [[Imanuel Geiss]] and [[Klaus Hildebrand]], all of whom Evans considered German apologists attempting to white-wash the German past. Evans' views on the ''Historikerstreit'' were set forth in his 1989 book, ''In Hitler's Shadow''. In that book, Evans took issue with Nolte's acceptance of the [[Commissar Order]] as a legitimate military order; with Nolte's argument that the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' massacres of Ukrainian Jews were a justifiable  "preventive security" response to [[Soviet partisan]] attacks; his description (citing [[Viktor Suvorov]]) of [[Operation Barbarossa]] as a "preventative war" forced on Hitler by an impending Soviet attack; and his complaints that much scholarship on the ''Shoah'' expressed the views of "biased" Jewish historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|pp=33–34, 42–43, 56, 82–83, 184–185}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans characterized Nolte's statements as crossing the line into [[Holocaust denial]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he singled out Nolte's rationalization that since [[the victors write history]], the only reason why Nazi Germany is seen as evil is because it lost the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|pp=32–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans also denounced, as an attempt to justify the Holocaust, Nolte's claim that [[Chaim Weizmann]]'s letter of 3 September 1939 to [[Neville Chamberlain]], promising that the [[Jewish Agency]] would support the war effort constituted "Jewish declaration of war" on Germany that justified the pre-emptive internment of Jews in concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1989 book ''In Hitler's Shadow'', Evans also criticised the [[intentionalist]] theories of Hillgruber and Hildebrand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|pp=68–72}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized Stürmer's excessive focus on [[political history]] and overlooking of social conditions, as a regression to the outmoded [[great man theory]] of history.&lt;ref name="Evans, Richard page 119"&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=119}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  For his part Evans praised [[Ian Kershaw]], who wrote that "The road to Auschwitz was built by hate, but paved with indifference".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Evans|1989|p=71}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans' ''In Defence of History'' defends the discipline of history against [[postmodernist]] skepticism of its value. The limitations of our ability to understand and learn from the past notwithstanding, it is still possible, he argues to reconstruct past events. Evans suggests that the spread in the 1980s and 1990s of post-modernist theories, which declare that history is solely the construct of the historian and depict the rationalist tradition of the West as a form of oppression, was not necessarily left-wing or progressive: by denying the posibility of accessing past facts, it had also done much to increase the appeal of Holocaust denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=290}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role as an expert witness in Irving v. Lipstadt==
{{see also|Irving v. Penguin Books and Lipstadt}}
Evans is probably best known to the general public in the role of an expert witness for the defence in the high-profile libel case of [[David Irving]] against the American historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] in 2000, [[Irving v. Lipstadt]]. Lipstadt was sued for libel by Irving, after she referred to him as a "Holocaust denier" and "an ardent follower of Adolf Hitler" in her 1993 book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]''. Lipstadt further accused Irving of "distorting evidence and manipulating documents to serve his own purposes...[as well as] skewing documents and misrepresenting data in order to reach historically untenable conclusions, particularly those that exonerate Hitler."&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard ''Lying About Hitler'', London: Perseus Books, 2002 p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans acted as an expert witness for the defence in the case. Starting in the autumn of 1997, Evans, along with Thomas Skelton-Robinson and [[Nikolaus Wachsmann|Nik Wachsmann]], two of his PhD students, closely examined Irving's work.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah, ''History on trial: my day in court with David Irving'', New York: ECCO, 2005, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; They found instances in which he had used forged documents, disregarded contrary evidence, selectively quoted historical documents out of context, and mis-cited historical records, thus misrepresenting historical evidence in order to support his prejudices.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard ''Lying About Hitler'', London: Perseus Books, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=218}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans subsequently proved to be a powerful witness in Lipstadt's ultimately successful defence. In his expert witness report he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Not one of [Irving's] books, speeches or articles, not one paragraph, not one sentence in any of them, can be taken on trust as an accurate representation of its historical subject. All of them are completely worthless as history, because Irving cannot be trusted anywhere, in any of them, to give a reliable account of what he is talking or writing about. ... if we mean by "historian" someone who is concerned to discover the truth about the past, and to give as accurate a representation of it as possible, then Irving is not an historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hdot.org/evans/#evans_6.html |publisher=Holocaust Denial on Trial |work=Expert Witness Report by Richard J. Evans FBA, Professor of Modern History, University of Cambridge |title=Chapter 6. General Conclusion |last=Evans |first=Richard J. |authorlink=Richard J. Evans |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The cross-examination of Evans by Irving was noted for the high degree of personal dislike between the two men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the degree of dislike that Irving challenged Evans on very minor points, such as Evans doubting the fairness of a 1938 German plebiscite in which the Nazi regime received 98.8% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=226}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A subject that much engaged Irving and Evans in a debate was a memo by the Chief of the Reich Chancellery [[Hans Lammers]] to the ''Reich'' Justice Minister [[Franz Schlegelberger]] in which Lammers wrote that Hitler ordered him to put the "Jewish Question" on the "back-burner" until after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=230–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Evans chose to accept the interpretation of the memo put forward by [[Eberhard Jäckel]] in the 1970s;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=230–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Irving chose to interpret the memo literally and taunted Evans by saying, "It is a terrible problem, is it not that we are faced with this tantalizing plate of crumbs and morsels of what should have provided the final smoking gun, and nowhere the whole way through the archives do we find even one item that we do not have to interpret or read between the lines of, but we do have in the same chain of evidence documents which...quite clearly specifically show Hitler intervening in the other sense?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|pp=232–3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Evans stated, "No, I do not accept that at all. It is because you want to interpret euphemisms as being literal, and that is what the whole problem is. Every time there is an euphemism, Mr. Irving ... or a camouflage piece of statement or language about Madagascar, you want to treat it as the literal truth, because it serves your purpose of trying to exculpate Hitler. That is part of ... the way you manipulate and distort the documents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Guttenplan|2001|p=233}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 interview, Evans described to the Canadian columnist [[Robert Fulford (journalist)|Robert Fulford]] his impression of Irving after being cross-examined by him as: "He [Irving] was a bit like a dim student who didn't listen. If he didn't get the answer he wanted, he just repeated the question."&lt;ref name="robertfulford.com"&gt;{{cite web| last = Fulford| first = Robert| title = David Irving: The Libel Trial Re-Examined | publisher =  The National Post|date=30 January 2001| url = http://www.robertfulford.com/DavidIrving.html | accessdate =14 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His findings and his account of the trial were published in his 2001 book ''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial'', which was published as ''Telling Lies About Hitler'' in the United States in 2002. The High Court rejected Irving’s libel suit and awarded costs to the defence.

Evans' involvement in the trial was included in the 2016 film ''[[Denial (2016 film)|Denial]]'', in which he was played by British actor [[John Sessions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://m.imdb.com/title/tt4645330/|title=IMDB|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=15 Jan 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Third Reich Trilogy''==
[[File:Richard J. Evans.JPG|thumb|Richard J. Evans (2016)]]
{{main article|The Third Reich Trilogy}}
Between 2003 and 2008, Evans published a three-volume history of the Third Reich. Drawing on years of experience as a leading scholar of [[German history]], Evans produced what some historians call the most extensive and comprehensive history of the rise and fall of Hitler’s regime ever produced by a single scholar.  Reviewer [[Peter Mansoor]] says, "The ''Third Reich at War'' is a superb piece of scholarship that is likely to emerge as the definitive account of life and death inside Hitler's blood soaked Third Reich."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Mansoor review in ''[[Shofar: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Jewish Studies]]'' (2011) 30#1 pp 187-189&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Citino]] says, "Read together, the three volumes constitute a remarkably comprehensive treatment of the origins, course, and death of the Hitler regime, and are likely to be standard works for a long time to come."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert M. Citino]] review in ''[[Central European History]]'' (2010) 43#3 pp 535-537&lt;/ref&gt;  Ed Ericson says:
:Evans masterfully interweaves testimony that has come to light in the intervening decades with learned judgments from hundreds of authors to create a balanced and thoughtful narrative. This book, therefore, will assuredly become the definitive work on ''The Third Reich at War.''&lt;ref&gt;Ed Ericson III review in ''Historian'' (2011) 73#2 pp 382-383, {{DOI|10.1111/j.1540-6563.2011.00294_50.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume, ''The Coming of the Third Reich: How the Nazis Destroyed Democracy and Seized Power in Germany'' (published by Penguin in 2003), shows how a country torn apart by the [[First World War]], the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] and the [[Great Depression]] moved towards an increasingly authoritarian solution. The book explains in detail [[Adolf Hitler]]'s appointment as  Chancellor in January 1933 and how the Nazis transformed Germany into a one party dictatorship. The first volume featured highly favorable words of praise from Evans's friend, [[Ian Kershaw]] on its cover.&lt;ref name=Snowman/&gt;

The second volume, ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933 - 1939: How the Nazis Won Over the Hearts and Minds of a Nation'' (published by Penguin in 2005), covers the years of Nazi rule between 1933 and 1939. The final chapter examines the road to the Second World War, but the real focus is on life inside Nazi Germany. One of the great strengths of this volume is the way Evans allows small stories of key individuals to illustrate many of the key social, economic and cultural events of the period. [[Richard Overy]] described this instalment of the trilogy as "magisterial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Overy |first= Richard |authorlink= Richard Overy |title= ''The Third Reich in Power, 1933–39'' by Richard J. Evans |url= http://www.exacteditions.com/read/literary-review/november-2005-1183 |journal= [[Literary Review]] |issue= November 2005 |pages= 23–24 |accessdate= 17 May 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third volume, ''The Third Reich at War: How the Nazis Led Germany from Conquest to Disaster'' (published by Penguin in 2008), looks at major developments from 1939 to 1945, including the key battles of the Second World War, a vivid, moving and detailed account of the mass murder enacted during [[the Holocaust]] and Hitler's dramatic downfall in Berlin in 1945. In an October 2008 review of the third volume for ''[[The Times]]'', best-selling historian [[Antony Beevor]] writes: "With this third volume, Richard Evans has accomplished a masterpiece of historical scholarship ... [He] has produced the best and most up-to-date synthesis of the huge work carried out on the subject over the past decades."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Third Reich at War by Richard J. Evans |first=Antony |last=Beevor |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article4915271.ece |newspaper=The Times |date=9 October 2008 |accessdate=29 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspects of it, however, were sharply criticised by [[Tim Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Snyder |first= Timothy |authorlink= Timothy Snyder |year= 2009 |title= Nazis, Soviets, Poles, Jews |url= http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2009/dec/03/nazis-soviets-poles-jews/?pagination=false |journal= [[The New York Review of Books]] |volume= 56 |issue= 19 |accessdate= 17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Reich]], former Director of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D. C.]], states about the third-volume of the trilogy, ''The Third Reich at War'', "If any work of accurate history has a chance to correct the distortions of public memory, this is it."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/17/books/review/Reich-t.html Walter Reich, "We Are All Guilty, ''New York Times Book Review'' (May 13, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Reich trilogy has been, or is being translated into sixteen foreign languages. 

==Recent publications and current work==

In 2013 Evans delivered the Menachem Stern Jerusalem Lectures to the Historical Society of Israel, publishing them in 2014 as "Altered Pasts: Counterfactuals in History". The book puts forward a variety of arguments against the use of long-range alternative historical timelines as an aid to serious historical understanding. In "Cosmopolitan Islanders: British Historians and the European Continent" (2009, an expanded version of his Inaugural Lecture as Regius Professor), he explored the reasons why so many British historians have made such major contributions to the historical understanding of other European countries. "The Third Reich in History and Memory" (2015) is a collection of 28 articles and review essays on modern German history published since the turn of the century.

Evans's most recent major book is ''The Pursuit of Power: Europe 1815-1914'', volume 7 in the ''Penguin History of Europe'', published in 2016. It has been widely reviewed. Gerard De Groot, writing in ''The Times'', commented that the book "chronicles a turbulent and confusing century with wonderful clarity and verve...in one great canvas of immense detail and beauty...transnational history at its finest." Dominic Sandbrook, in the ''Sunday Times'', described it as "dazzlingly erudite and entertaining." It has been, or is being translated into Dutch, Spanish, German, Greek, Chinese, Korean, Japanese and Portuguese. 

He is currently working on a biography of the historian Eric Hobsbawm. From 2013 to 2018 he has been Principal Investigator in a £1.6 million Leverhulme Programme Grant on conspiracy theories (conspiracyanddemocracy.org) and is preparing work based on the findings of the project.

==Regius Professor of Modern History==
In 2008, Evans was appointed Regius Professor of Modern History at [[Cambridge University]]. (In 2010 the word "Modern" was removed from the title by royal decree). The post is a royal appointment in the gift of the Prime Minister of the day and dates back to 1724. Previous holders of the title have included [[John Dalberg-Acton]] (1895), [[Herbert Butterfield]] (1963), [[Geoffrey Elton]] (1983), [[Patrick Collinson]] (1988) and [[Quentin Skinner]] (1998). Evans is the first historian to have to apply for the post and be interviewed by a Board of Electors, including Cambridge's Vice-Chancellor, [[Alison Richard]], and representatives of the history faculty and the university, as well as external assessors from Yale, Harvard, Oxford and London. The board selected a shortlist of four, each of whom was asked to give a presentation to the entire Cambridge history faculty. The shortlist of four was then reduced to two, whom the board interviewed, resulting in the board's recommendation of Evans to the Prime Minister and in the issue of a Royal Warrant for his appointment.&lt;ref&gt;He applied for the distinguished Cambridge position of Regius professor, rather than being appointed, a procedural change at Cambridge.{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/richard-evans-the-don-whos-making-history-969095.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Richard Evans: The don who's making history | date=23 October 2008 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as serving as Regius Professor, Evans served as chairman of the history faculty from October 2008 to 30 September 2010.

Evans is used to combining administration with research. At Birkbeck College, London, where he worked before Cambridge, he acted as Master of the college when [[Baroness Blackstone]] left suddenly to become [[Tony Blair]]'s first higher education minister. On 27 January 2010 he was elected to the position of President of [[Wolfson College, Cambridge]], serving the statutory seven-year term of office until retiring from the post on 30 September 2017. During this period he focused on building up the College as a centre of contemporary culture, with art exhibitions by Richard Deacon and Anthony Green, and talks by Martin Amis and Neil MacGregor, among many others. In 2014 he was appointed Provost of Gresham College, in the City of London, an institution founded in 1597 to provide free lectures to Londoners. There are now over 2,000 lectures on the College's website and the 130 lectures a year are all live-streamed.

==TV and media appearances==
Evans has appeared regularly on a number of TV documentaries related to Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. He recently appeared on a major TV documentary on the History Channel which examined [[20 July plot|the Valkyrie bomb plot]] against Hitler in July 1944, which was the subject of a [[Valkyrie (film)|Hollywood film]] starring [[Tom Cruise]]. 

He writes reviews of history books for the London Review of Books, the Times Literary Supplement and The Guardian, as well as historical reflections on recent events for American magazines and websites, including Foreign Policy, The Nation, and Vox. He is a noted lecturer and gives numerous keynote lectures at international conferences around the world and also at student conferences as part of his remit to take history to a wider audience beyond academia. 

==Other contributions==

Evans has been eo-editor of the Journal of Contemporary History since 2000, and has also served as Deputy Chair of the Spoliation Advisory Panel, a UK government non-departmental public body formed to make recommendations to the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on the restitution of cultural objects looted during the Nazi era. He has been a judge of the Wolfson History Prize, the UK's richest history book award, for over twenty years.

==Controversies==
===First World War===
In 2014, Evans was involved in a debate with [[Michael Gove]], the British education secretary, about the content and style of history teaching and the way that the curriculum is structured and how the First World War should be portrayed.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Evans|first1=Richard J.|title=Richard J Evans: Michael Gove shows his ignorance of history – again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/06/richard-evans-michael-gove-history-education|website=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Gove accused Evans, in particular, of distorting Britain's role in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gove|first1=Michael|title=Why does the Left insist on belittling true British heroes? MICHAEL GOVE asks damning question as the anniversary of the First World War approaches|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2532930/MICHAEL-GOVE-Why-does-Left-insist-belittling-true-British-heroes.html|website=The Daily Mail|accessdate=24 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evans countered that Gove was engaging in the defamation of academic historians and "narrow, tub-thumping jingoism". Evans stated that he agreed with Gove's statement that "the ruthless [[Social Darwinism]] of the German elites, the pitiless approach they took to occupation, their aggressively expansionist war aims and their scorn for the international order all made resistance more than justified".&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; Evans wrote that Gove was "right about the elites, but misses the point that they weren't able to carry the majority of the German people with them; the largest political party, the Social Democrats, was opposed to annexations and had long been critical of the militarism of the elites".&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; 

He also ridiculed Gove's suggestion that the First World War was "just" and fought by men "committed to defending the western liberal order" and pointed out that Britain allied with Tsar [[Nicholas II of Russia]], a far more despotic ruler than even German Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]], and that 40% of British adult males were then not allowed to vote.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt; Evans also wrote that Gove was wrong about left-wing historians believing that Britain was wrong to fight Germany in World War I; Evans pointed out that right-wingers like [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Alan Clark]] have quite vocally expressed the same belief.&lt;ref name=richard/&gt;

===Teaching of history at universities===
In 2011, Evans became involved in a polemical exchange of letters with [[Peter Baldwin (professor)|Peter Baldwin]] after agreeing with Leif Jerram, who wrote in ''Cosmopolitan Islanders'' in 2009 that students in Britain could find a richer selection of courses on the histories of other countries in British universities than students from other countries could in their own countries.&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám''''' is the title that [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]] gave to his 1859 translation from [[Farsi]] to English of a selection of [[quatrain]]s (''{{lang|ar-Latn|[[ruba'i|rubāʿiyāt]]}}'') attributed to [[Omar Khayyam]]  (1048–1131), dubbed "the Astronomer-Poet of Persia".

FitzGerald's work at first was unsuccessful commercially. But it was popularised from 1861 onward by [[Whitley Stokes]], and the work came to be greatly admired by the [[Pre-Raphaelites]] in England. In  1872 FitzGerald had a third edition printed, which increased interest in the work in the United States of America. By the 1880s, the book was extremely well known throughout the English-speaking world, to the extent that numerous "Omar Khayyam Clubs" were formed and there was a "fin de siècle cult of the Rubaiyat".&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Yohannan, ''Persian Poetry in England and America'', 1977., p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;
FitzGerald's work has been published in several hundred editions, and it has inspired similar translation efforts in English and in many other languages.

The authenticity of the poetry attributed to Omar Khayyam is highly uncertain. Omar was famous during his lifetime not as a poet but as an astronomer and mathematician. The earliest reference to his having written poetry is found in his biography by [[Imad ad-Din al-Isfahani|al-Isfahani]], written 43 years after his death. This view is reinforced by other medieval historians such as [[Shahrazuri]] (1201) and [[Al-Qifti]] (1255). Parts of the ''Rubaiyat'' appear as incidental quotations from Omar in early works of biography and in anthologies. These include works of [[Fakhr al-Din Razi|Razi]] (ca. 1160-1210), [[Najm al-Din Razi|Daya]] (1230), [[Ata-Malik Juvayni|Juvayni]] (ca. 1226-1283), and Jajarmi (1340).&lt;ref name="Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''. Oneworld 2005, {{ISBN|1-85168-355-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|92}}&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;Edward Denison Ross, "Omar Khayyam", ''Bulletin of the School Of Oriental Studies'', London Institution (1927)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|434}} Also, five quatrains assigned to Khayyam in somewhat later sources appear in Zahiri Samarqandi's ''[[Sindbad-Nameh]]'' (before 1160) without attribution.&lt;ref name="Dashti"&gt;Ali Dashti (translated by L. P. Elwell-Sutton), ''In Search of Omar Khayyam'', Routledge Library Editions: Iran (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

The number of quatrains attributed to him in more recent collections varies from about 1,200 (according to [[Saeed Nafisi]]) to more than 2,000. Skeptical scholars point out that the entire tradition may be [[pseudepigraphic]].&lt;ref name="Dashti" /&gt;{{rp|11}}
The extant manuscripts containing collections attributed to Omar are dated much too late to enable a reconstruction of a body of authentic verses. 

In the 1930s, Iranian scholars, notably [[Mohammad-Ali Foroughi]], attempted to reconstruct a core of authentic verses from scattered quotes by authors of the 13th and 14th centuries, ignoring the younger manuscript tradition. After World War II, reconstruction efforts were significantly delayed by two clever forgeries. De Blois (2004) is pessimistic, suggesting that contemporary scholarship has not advanced beyond the situation of the 1930s, when [[Hans Heinrich Schaeder]] commented that the name of Omar Khayyam "is to be struck out from the history of Persian literature".&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA307 p. 307].&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature of the more recent collections is the lack of linguistic homogeneity and continuity of ideas. [[Sadegh Hedayat]] commented that "if a man had lived for a hundred years and had changed his religion, philosophy, and beliefs twice a day, he could scarcely have given expression to such a range of ideas".&lt;ref name="Dashti"/&gt;{{rp|34}} Hedayat's final verdict was that 14 quatrains could be attributed to Khayyam with certainty.&lt;ref name="Sadeq Hedayat's Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bashiri|first1=Iraj|title=Sadeq Hedayat's Learning|url=http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Fiction/Learning.html|website=Blind Owl|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various tests have been employed to reduce the quatrains attributable to Omar to about 100.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;{{rp|434}} Arthur Christensen states that "of more than 1,200 ruba'is known to be ascribed to Omar, only 121 could be regarded as reasonably authentic".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran" /&gt;{{rp|663}} Foroughi accepts 178 quatrains as authentic, while [[Ali Dashti]] accepts 36 of them.&lt;ref name="Ross" /&gt;{{rp|96}}

FitzGerald's source were transcripts sent to him in 1856&amp;ndash;1857 by his friend and teacher [[Edward B. Cowell]] of two manuscripts, a Bodleian manuscript with 158 quatrains,&lt;ref&gt;MS. Ouseley 140, copied in 1460 in [[Shiraz]], Persia, 47 folia. This is the oldest securely dated manuscript of 
Omar Khayyam's poetry. It belonged to [[William Ouseley]] (1767-1842) and was purchased by the Bodleian Library in 1844.&lt;/ref&gt;
and a "Calcutta manuscript". 

FitzGerald completed his first draft in 1857 and sent it to ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in January 1858.
He made a revised draft in January 1859, of which he privately printed 250 copies. This first edition became extremely sought-after by the 1890s, when "more than two million copies ha[d] been sold in two hundred editions".&lt;ref&gt;Preface to a [https://books.google.ch/books?id=NAtFAQAAIAAJ  facsimile of the first edition] (no year [c. 1900], "from the fine copy owned by Charles Dana Burrage" [1857-1926]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism vs. Sufism debate==
The extreme popularity of FitzGerald's work led to a prolonged debate on the correct interpretation of the philosophy behind the poems. FitzGerald emphasized the religious skepticism he found in Omar Khayyam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Dick|title=FitzGerald, Edward|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/fitzgerald-|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his preface to the ''Rubáiyát'', he describes Omar's philosophy as [[Epicurean]] and claims that Omar was "hated and dreaded by the Sufis, whose practice he ridiculed  and whose faith amounts to little more than his own, when stripped of the Mysticism and formal recognition of Islamism under which Omar would not hide."&lt;ref&gt;FitzGerald, E. (2010). ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (p. 12). Champaign, Ill.: Project Gutenberg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Nelson Frye]] also emphasizes that Khayyam was despised by a number of prominent contemporary Sufis. These include figures such as [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Najm al-Din Razi|Najm al-Din Daya]], [[Al-Ghazali]], and [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], who "viewed Khayyam not as a fellow-mystic, but a free-thinking scientist".&lt;ref name="The Cambridge History of Iran"&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran'', Volume 4. Cambridge University Press (1975): Richard Nelson Frye&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|663–664}} The skeptic interpretation is supported by the medieval historian [[Al-Qifti]] (ca. 1172–1248), who in his ''The History of Learned Men'' reports that Omar's poems were only outwardly in the Sufi style, but were written with an anti-religious agenda. He also mentions that Khayyam was indicted for impiety and went on a [[hajj|pilgrimage]] to avoid punishment.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sufis understood his poems outwardly and considered them to be part of their mystical tradition. In their sessions and gatherings, Khayyam's poems became the subject of conversation and discussion. His poems, however, are inwardly like snakes who bite the sharia [Islamic law] and are chains and handcuffs placed on religion. Once the people of his time had a taste of his faith, his secrets were revealed. Khayyam was frightened for his life, withdrew from writing, speaking and such like and traveled to [[Mecca]]. Once he arrived in [[Baghdad]], members of a Sufi tradition and believers in primary sciences came to him and courted him. He did not accept them and after performing the pilgrimage returned to his native land, kept his secrets to himself and propagated worshiping and following the people of faith." cited after Aminrazavi (2007){{page needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Critics of FitzGerald, on the other hand, have accused the translator of misrepresenting the mysticism of Sufi poetry by an overly literal interpretation. Thus, the view of Omar Khayyam as a Sufi was defended by Bjerregaard (1915).&lt;ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The writings of Omar Khayyam are good specimens of [[Sufism]], but are not valued in the West as they ought to be, and the mass of English-speaking people know him only through the poems of [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward Fitzgerald]]. It is unfortunate because Fitzgerald is not faithful to his master and model, and at times he lays words upon the tongue of the Sufi which are blasphemous. Such outrageous language is that of the eighty-first quatrain for instance. Fitzgerald is doubly guilty because he was more of a Sufi than he was willing to admit." C. H. A. Bjerregaard, ''Sufism: Omar Khayyam and E. Fitzgerald'', The Sufi Publishing Society (1915), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Dougan (1991) likewise says that attributing [[hedonism]] to Omar is due to the failings of FitzGerald's translation, arguing that the poetry is to be understood as "deeply esoteric".&lt;ref&gt;"Every line of the Rubaiyat has more meaning than almost anything you could read in Sufi literature". Abdullah Dougan, [http://www.gnosticpress.co.nz/ ''Who is the Potter?''], Gnostic Press 1991 {{ISBN|0-473-01064-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Idries Shah]] (1999) similarly says that FitzGerald misunderstood Omar's poetry.&lt;ref&gt;"FitzGerald himself was confused about Omar. Sometimes he thought that he was a Sufi, sometimes not." Idries Shah, ''The Sufis'', Octagon Press (1999), pp. 165-166&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sufi interpretation is the view of a minority of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aminrazavi|first1=Mehdi|title=Umar Khayyam|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/umar-khayyam/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Beveridge]] states that "the Sufis have unaccountably pressed this writer [Khayyam] into their service; they explain away some of his blasphemies by forced interpretations, and others they represent as innocent freedoms and reproaches".&lt;ref&gt;Beveridge, H. (1905). XVIII. "Omar Khayyam". ''Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society'', 37(3), 521-526.&lt;/ref&gt; Aminrazavi (2007) states that "Sufi interpretation of Khayyam is possible only by reading into his Rubaiyat extensively and by stretching the content to fit the classical Sufi doctrine".&lt;ref name="Wine of Wisdom" /&gt;{{rp|128}}

FitzGerald's "skepticist" reading of the poetry is still defended by modern scholars. Sadegh Hedayat (''[[The Blind Owl]]'' 1936) was the most notable modern proponent of Khayyam's philosophy as agnostic skepticism. In his introductory essay to his second edition of the ''Quatrains of the Philosopher Omar Khayyam'' (1922), Hedayat states that "while Khayyam believes in the transmutation and transformation of the human body, he does not believe in a separate soul; if we are lucky, our bodily particles would be used in the making of a jug of wine".&lt;ref&gt;Katouzian, H. (1991). Sadeq Hedayat: ''The life and literature of an Iranian writer'' (p. 138). London: I.B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; He concludes that "religion has proved incapable of surmounting his inherent fears; thus Khayyam finds himself alone and insecure in a universe about which his knowledge is nil". In his later work (''Khayyam's Quatrains'', 1935), Hedayat further maintains that Khayyam's usage of Sufic terminology such as "wine" is literal, and that  "Khayyam took refuge in wine to ward off bitterness and to blunt the cutting edge of his thoughts."&lt;ref name="Sadeq Hedayat's Learning" /&gt;

==Editions==

FitzGerald's text was published in five editions, with substantial revisions:
* 1st edition – 1859 [75 quatrains]
* 2nd edition – 1868 [110 quatrains]
* 3rd edition – 1872 [101 quatrains]
**1878, "first American edition", reprint of the 3rd ed.
* 4th edition – 1879 [101 quatrains]
* 5th edition – 1889 [101 quatrains]

Of the five editions published, four were published under the authorial control of FitzGerald. The fifth edition, which contained only minor changes from the fourth, was edited posthumously after his death on the basis of manuscript revisions FitzGerald had left.

Numerous later editions were published after 1889, notably an edition with illustrations by [[Willy Pogany]], first published in 1909 (George G. Harrap, London). It was issued in numerous revised editions.This edition combined FitzGerald's texts of the 1st and 4th editions and was subtitled "The First and Fourth Renderings in English Verse".

A bibliography of editions compiled in 1929 listed more than 300 separate editions.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose George Potter, ''A Bibliography of the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'' (1929).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many more have been published since.&lt;ref&gt;Francois De Blois, ''Persian Literature - A Bio-Bibliographical Survey: Poetry of the Pre-Mongol Period'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=2e55wuzPc3IC&amp;pg=PA312 p. 312].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character of translation==
FitzGerald's translation is rhyming and metrical, and rather [[Free translation|free]]. Many of the verses are paraphrased, and some of them cannot be confidently traced to his source material at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|last=Fitzgerald|first=Edward|publisher=Rupa &amp; Co.|year=2007|isbn=81-7167-439-9|location=New Delhi|pages=132|chapter=Note by W. Aldis Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt; FitzGerald described his work as "transmogrification".{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} To a large extent, the ''Rubaiyat'' can be considered original poetry by FitzGerald loosely based on Omar's quatrains rather than a "translation" in the narrow sense.

FitzGerald was open about the liberties he had taken with his source material:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My translation will interest you from its form, and also in many respects in its detail: very un-literal as it is. Many quatrains are mashed together: and something lost, I doubt, of Omar's simplicity, which is so much a virtue in him. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 9/3/58)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;I suppose very few People have ever taken such Pains in Translation as I have: though certainly not to be literal. But at all Cost, a Thing must live: with a transfusion of one's own worse Life if one can’t retain the Original's better. Better a live Sparrow than a stuffed Eagle. (letter to E. B. Cowell, 4/27/59)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For comparison, here are two versions of the same quatrain by FitzGerald, from the 1859 and 1889 editions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This quatrain has a close correspondence in two of the quatrains in the [[Bodleian Library]] ms., numbers 149 and 155. In the literal prose translation of 
[[Edward Heron-Allen]] (1898):&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rubaiyatbodleian00omar#page/266/mode/2up The Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam : being a facsimile of the manuscript in the Bodleian Library at Oxford, with a transcript into modern Persian characters.

===English===
Multilingual edition, published in 1955 by [[Tahrir Iran Co.]]/[[Kashani Bros.]]]]

Two English editions by [[Edward Henry Whinfield]] (1836&amp;ndash;1922) consisted of 253 quatrains in 1882 and 500 in 1883. This translation was fully revised and some cases fully translated anew by Ali Salami and published by Mehrandish Books.

Whinfield's translation is, if possible, even more free than FitzGerald's; Quatrain 84 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above) reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In the sweet spring a grassy bank I sought
And thither wine and a fair [[Houri]] brought;
And, though the people called me graceless dog,
Gave not to [[Paradise]] another thought!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

John Leslie Garner published an English translation of 152 quatrains in 1888. His was also a free, rhyming translation.
Quatrain I. 20 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Yes, Loved One, when the Laughing Spring is blowing,
With Thee beside me and the Cup o’erflowing,
I pass the day upon this Waving Meadow,
And dream the while, no thought on Heaven bestowing.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] (1859–1936) (Member of Parliament for [[Newry (UK Parliament constituency)|Newry]]) published prose translations of 466 quatrains in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;Omar Khayyam, ''Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', translated by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]] MP. [London] : D. Nutt, 1889. (Source: [http://library.catalogue.tcd.ie/record=b13332609~S9 Trinity College Dublin Library])&lt;/ref&gt;
Quatrain 177 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In Spring time I love to sit in the meadow with a paramour
perfect as a Houri and goodly jar of wine, and though
I may be blamed for this, yet hold me lower
than a dog if ever I dream of Paradise.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Richard Le Gallienne]] (1866–1947) produced a verse translation, subtitled "a paraphrase from several literal translations", in 1897. 
In his introductory note to the reader, Le Gallienne cites [[Justin Huntly McCarthy|McCarthy]]'s "charming prose" as the chief influence on his version. Some example quatrains follow:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Look not above, there is no answer there;
Pray not, for no one listens to your prayer;
Near is as near to God as any Far,
And Here is just the same deceit as There.
''(#78, on p. 44)''

And do you think that unto such as you;
A [[maggot]]-minded, starved, fanatic crew:
God gave the secret, and denied it me?—
Well, well, what matters it! Believe that, too.
''(#85, p. 47)''

"Did God set grapes a-growing, do you think,
And at the same time make it sin to drink?
Give thanks to Him who foreordained it thus—
Surely He loves to hear the glasses clink!"
''(#91, p. 48)''
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Edward Heron-Allen]] (1861–1943) published a prose translation in 1898. He also wrote an introduction to an edition of [[Frederick Rolfe]] (Baron Corvo) 's translation into English of Nicolas's French translation.

The English novelist and orientalist [[Jessie Cadell]] (1844–1884) consulted various manuscripts of the Rubaiyat with the intention of producing an authoritative edition. Her translation of 150 quatrains was published posthumously in 1899.&lt;ref name=ODNBCadell&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raza|first1=Rosemary Cargill|chapter=Cadell, Jessie Ellen (1844&amp;ndash;1884)|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/4300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]] in 1959 attempted a scholarly edition of Khayyam, based on thirteenth-century manuscripts. However, his manuscripts were subsequently exposed as twentieth-century forgeries.&lt;ref name=TLS&gt;{{cite web

The 1967 translation of the Rubáiyat by [[Robert Graves]] and [[Omar Ali-Shah]], however, created a scandal. The authors claimed it was based on a twelfth-century manuscript located in Afghanistan, where it was allegedly utilized as a Sufi teaching document. But the manuscript was never produced, and British experts in Persian literature were easily able to prove that the translation was in fact based on Edward Heron Allen's analysis of possible sources for FitzGerald's work.&lt;ref name=TLS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aminrazavi, Mehdi: ''The Wine of Wisdom''. Oneworld 2005, {{ISBN|1-85168-355-0}}, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;

Quatrains 11 and 12 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Should our day's portion be one mancel loaf,
A haunch of [[mutton]] and a gourd of wine
Set for us two alone on the wide plain,
No Sultan's bounty could evoke such joy.

A gourd of red wine and a sheaf of poems —
A bare subsistence, half a loaf, not more —
Supplied us two alone in the free desert:
What Sultan could we envy on his throne?
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[http://oberlin.edu/library/special/bowen.html John Charles Edward Bowen (1909-1989)] was a British poet and translator of Persian poetry. He is best known for his translation of the Rubaiyat, titled ''A New Selection from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.'' Bowen is also credited as being one of the first scholars to question Robert Graves' and Omar Ali-Shah's translation of the Rubaiyat.&lt;ref&gt;http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001005780&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern version of 235 quatrains, claiming to be "as literal an English version of the Persian originals as readability and intelligibility permit", was published in 1979 by [[Peter Avery]] and [[John Heath-Stubbs]]. 
Their edition provides two versions of the thematic quatrain, the first (98) considered by the Persian writer [[Sadeq Hedayat]] to be a spurious attribution.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
98.
I need a jug of wine and a book of poetry,
Half a loaf for a bite to eat,
Then you and I, seated in a deserted spot,
Will have more wealth than a Sultan's realm.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
234.
If chance supplied a loaf of white bread,
Two casks of wine and a leg of mutton,
In the corner of a garden with a tulip-cheeked girl,
There'd be enjoyment no Sultan could outdo.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1988, the Rubaiyat was translated by a Persian for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Azarang|first=Abd-al Hussein|title=Emami, Karim|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/emami-karim-translator-editor|work=Encyclopædia Iranica|publisher=iranicaonline.org|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karim Emami]]'s translation of the Rubaiyat was published under the title ''The Wine of Nishapour'' in Paris. ''The Wine of Nishapour'' is the collection of Khayyam's poetry by Shahrokh Golestan, including Golestan's pictures in front of each poem.&lt;ref&gt;Emami, Karim. ''Ups and Downs of Translation'', Tehran, 1988, pp. 134-169&lt;/ref&gt;  
Example quatrain 160 (equivalent{{dubious|date=September 2017}} of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his first edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
In spring if a houri-like sweetheart
Gives me a cup of wine on the edge of a green cornfield,
Though to the vulgar this would be blasphemy,
If I mentioned any other Paradise, I'd be worse than a dog.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1991 [[Ahmad Saidi]] (1904–1994) produced an English translation of 165 quatrains grouped into 10 themes. Born and raised in Iran, Saidi went to the United States in 1931 and attended college there. He served as the head of the Persian Publication Desk at the U.S. Office of War Information during World War II, inaugurated the Voice of America to Iran, and prepared an English-[[Persian language|Persian]] military dictionary for the Department of Defense. His quatrains include the original Persian verses for reference alongside his English translations. His focus was to faithfully convey, with less poetic license, Khayyam's original religious, mystical, and historic Persian themes, through the verses as well as his extensive annotations. Two example quatrains follow:

Quatrain 16 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XII in his 5th edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Ah, would there were a loaf of bread as fare,
A joint of lamb, a jug of vintage rare,
And you and I in wilderness encamped—
No Sultan's pleasure could with ours compare.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quatrain 75:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The sphere upon which mortals come and go,
Has no end nor beginning that we know;
And none there is to tell us in plain truth:
Whence do we come and whither do we go.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===German===
[[Adolf Friedrich von Schack]] (1815–1894) published a German translation in 1878.

Quatrain 151 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Gönnt mir, mit dem Liebchen im Gartenrund
Zu weilen bei süßem Rebengetränke,
Und nennt mich schlimmer als einen Hund,
Wenn ferner an's Paradies ich denke!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Friedrich Martin von Bodenstedt|Friedrich Martinus von Bodenstedt]] (1819–1892) published a German translation in 1881. The translation eventually consisted of 395 quatrains.

Quatrain IX, 59 (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Im Frühling mag ich gern im Grüne weilen
Und Einsamkeit mit einer Freundin teilen
Und einem Kruge Wein. Mag man mich schelten:
Ich lasse keinen andern Himmel gelten.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===French===
The first French translation, of 464 quatrains in prose, was made by J. B. Nicolas, chief interpreter at the French embassy in Persia in 1867.

Prose stanza (equivalent of Fitzgerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):

&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Au printemps j’aime à m’asseoir au bord d’une prairie, avec une idole semblable à une houri et une cruche de vin, s’il y en a, et bien que tout cela soit généralement blâmé, je veux être pire qu’un chien si jamais je songe au paradis.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The best-known version in French is the free verse edition by Franz Toussaint (1879–1955) published in 1924. This translation consisting of 170 [[quatrains]] was done from the original Persian text, while most of the other French translations were themselves translations of FitzGerald's work. The ''Éditions d'art Henri Piazza'' published the book almost unchanged between 1924 and 1979. Toussaint's translation has served as the basis of subsequent translations into other languages, but Toussaint did not live to witness the influence his translation has had.

Quatrain XXV (equivalent of FitzGerald's quatrain XI in his 1st edition, as above):
&lt;blockquote lang="fr"&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
''Au printemps, je vais quelquefois m’asseoir à la lisière d’un champ fleuri. Lorsqu’une belle jeune fille m’apporte une coupe de vin, je ne pense guère à mon salut. Si j’avais cette préoccupation, je vaudrais moins qu’un chien.''
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Russian===
Many [[Russian language|Russian-language]] translations have been undertaken, reflecting the popularity of the ''Rubaiyat'' in [[Russia]] since the late 19th century and the increasingly popular tradition of using it for the purposes of [[bibliomancy]]. The earliest verse translation (by [[Vasily Velichko]]) was published in 1891. The version by Osip Rumer published in 1914 is a translation of FitzGerald's version. Rumer later published a version of 304 rubaiyat translated directly from Persian. A lot of poetic translations (some based on verbatim translations into prose by others) were also written by [[German Plisetsky]], [[Konstantin Bal'mont]], Ts. Banu, I. Tkhorzhevsky, L. Pen'kovsky, and others.

==Influence==

FitzGerald rendered Omar's name as "Omar the Tentmaker",{{dubious|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--apparently not in FitzGerald's text--&gt; and this name resonated in English-speaking popular culture for a while. Thus, [[Nathan Haskell Dole]] published a novel called ''Omar, the Tentmaker: A Romance of Old Persia'' in 1898. ''Omar the Tentmaker of Naishapur'' is a historical novel by John Smith Clarke, published in 1910. 
"Omar the Tentmaker" is a 1914 play in an oriental setting by [[Richard Walton Tully]], adapted as a [[Omar the Tentmaker (film)|silent film]] in 1922.
US General [[Omar Bradley]] was given the nickname "Omar the Tent-Maker" in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey D. Lavoie, ''
The Private Life of General Omar N. Bradley'' (2015), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the name has been recorded as a slang expression for "[[penis]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kimmel, Christine Milrod, Amanda Kennedy,  ''Cultural Encyclopedia of the Penis'' (2014), p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;
FitzGerald's translations also reintroduced Khayyam to  Iranians, "who had long ignored the Neishapouri poet".&lt;ref name="Molavi110"&gt;Molavi, Afshin, ''The Soul of Iran'', Norton, (2005), p. 110f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===

{{trivia|date=September 2017}}
* The title of [[Rex Stout]]'s [[Nero Wolfe]] novel ''[[Some Buried Caesar]]'' comes from one of the Tentmaker's quatrains (FitzGerald's XVIII), for example.
* [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s drama ''[[Ah, Wilderness!]]'' derives its title from the first quoted quatrain above.
* [[Agatha Christie]] used ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' as a story title, as did [[Stephen King]]. See also ''[[And Having Writ…]]''.
* [[Lan Wright]] used ''[[Dawn's Left Hand]]'' as the title of a science fiction story serialized in ''[[New Worlds Science Fiction]]'' (January–March 1963).
* The title of [[Allen Drury]]'s science fiction novel ''[[The Throne of Saturn (novel)|The Throne of Saturn]]'' comes from a quatrain which appears as the book's [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]].

Equally noteworthy are these works likewise influenced:
* The satirist and short story writer Hector Hugh Munro took his pen name of '[[Saki]]' from Edward FitzGerald's translation of the Rubaiyat.
* The American author [[O. Henry]] humorously referred to a book by "Homer KM" with the character "Ruby Ott" in his short story "The Handbook of Hymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.literaturecollection.com/a/o_henry/66/ |title=The Handbook of Hymen by O.

Henry also quoted a quatrain from the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam in "The Rubaiyat of a Scotch Highball."
* [[Oliver Herford]] released a parody of the Rubaiyat called "The Rubaiyat of a Persian Kitten" in 1904, which is notable for its charming illustrations of the kitten in question on his philosophical adventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldfashionedamericanhumor.com/the-rubaiyat-of-a-persian-kitten.html |title=Old Fashioned American Humor |publisher=Old Fashioned American Humor |date=6 March 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The American horror author [[H P Lovecraft]] created an Arab poet [[Abdul Alhazred]] to whom was attributed a couplet:
:::That is not dead which can eternal lie
:::And with strange aeons even death may die.
:Lovecraft was obsessed with the [[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]] and had no doubt read the Fitzgerald translation - the couplet follows Fitzgerald's [[Meter (poetry)|metre]] and rhyme pattern for the first half of a Khayyam quatrain.
* The artist/illustrator [[Edmund Dulac]] produced some much-beloved illustrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/ |title=oldfineart.com |publisher=oldfineart.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005104159/http://www.oldfineart.com/albums/rubaiyat-of-omar-khayyam-illustrated-by-edmund-dulac/pages/1/ |archivedate=5 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the Rubaiyat, 1909.
* The play ''[[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' (1923) by [[Seán O'Casey]] contains a reference to the ''Rubaiyat'' as the character Donal Davoren quotes "grasp this sorry scheme of things entire, and mould life nearer to the heart's desire."
* The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] discusses ''The Rubaiyat'' and its history in an essay, "The Enigma of Edward FitzGerald" ("El enigma de Edward FitzGerald") in his book "Other Inquisitions" ("Otras Inquisiciones", 1952). He also references it in some of his poems, including "Rubaiyat" in "The Praise of the Shadow" ("Elogio de la Sombra", 1969), and "Chess" ("Ajedrez") in "The Maker" ("El Hacedor", 1960). Borges' father [[Jorge Guillermo Borges]] was the author of a Spanish translation of the FitzGerald version of The Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author [[Paul Marlowe]]'s story "Resurrection and Life" featured a character who could only communicate using lines from the Rubaiyat.
* Science fiction author [[Isaac Asimov]] quotes ''[[The Moving Finger]]'' in his time-travel novel ''[[The End of Eternity]]''  when a character discusses whether history could be changed.
* [[Charles M. Schulz|Charles Schultz]] wrote a strip in which Lucy reads the ''[[Jug of Wine]]'' passage, and Linus asks "No blanket?".
* [[Wendy Cope]]'s poem "Strugnell's Rubiyat" is a close parody of the FitzGerald translation, relocated to modern day [[Tulse Hill]].
* One of the title pages of ''[[Principia Discordia]]'' (1965), a co-author of which went by the pen-name [[Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst]], features its own spin on the quatrain most quoted above:
::: A jug of wine,
::: A leg of lamb
:::: And thou!
::: Beside me,
:::: Whistling in
::::: the darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.principiadiscordia.com/book/5.php |title=Principia Discordia, the book of Chaos, Discord and Confusion |publisher=Principiadiscordia.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Lebanese writer [[Amin Maalouf]] based his novel ''[[Samarkand (novel)|Samarkand]]'' (1988) on the life of [[Omar Khayyam]], and the creation of the Rubaiyat. It details the [[Hashshashin|Assassin]] sect as well, and includes a fictional telling of how the (non-existent) original manuscript came to be on the ''[[RMS Titanic]]''.
* In the opening chapter of his book ''[[God is Not Great]]'' (2007), [[Christopher Hitchens]] quotes from [[Richard Le Gallienne]]'s translation of Khayyam's famous quatrain:
:::And do you think that unto such as you
:::A maggot-minded, starved, fanatic crew
:::God gave the secret, and denied it me?
:::Well, well--what matters it? Believe that, too!
* The title of [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s memoir ''Myself when Young'' is a quote from quatrain 27 of Fitzgerald's translation:
:::Myself when young did eagerly frequent
:::Doctor and Saint, and heard great Argument
:::About it and about: but evermore
:::Came out by the same Door as in I went.

===Cinema===
* Filmmaker [[D.W. Griffith]] planned a film based on the poems as a follow-up to ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' in 1916. It was to star [[Miriam Cooper]], but when she left the Griffith company the plans were dropped;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dark Lady of the Silents |last=Cooper |first=Miriam |year=1973 |publisher=Bobbs Merrill |isbn=0672517256 |page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; he would ultimately film ''[[Broken Blossoms]]'' instead.
* A canto was quoted and used as an underlying theme of the 1945 screen adaptation of ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]'': "I sent my soul through the invisible, some letters of that after-life to spell, and by and by my soul did return, and answered, 'I myself am Heaven and Hell.'"
* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the 1946 [[King Vidor]] Western film ''[[Duel in the Sun (film)|Duel in the Sun]]'', which starred [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Jennifer Jones]]: "Oh threats of hell and hopes of paradise! One thing at least is certain: This life flies. One thing is certain and the rest is Lies; The Flower that once is blown for ever dies."
* The 1951 film ''[[Pandora and the Flying Dutchman]]'', starring [[James Mason]] and [[Ava Gardner]], opens with an illuminated manuscript of the quatrain beginning "The moving finger writes...".
* In the film ''[[The Music Man (1962 film)|The Music Man]]'' (based on the 1957 [[The Music Man|musical]]), town librarian Marian Paroo draws down the wrath of the mayor's wife for encouraging the woman's daughter to read a book of "dirty Persian poetry." Summarizing what she calls the "Ruby Hat of Omar Kayayayayay...I am ''appalled!!"'', the mayor's wife paraphrases FitzGerald's Quatrain XII from his 5th edition: "People lying out in the woods eating sandwiches, and drinking directly out of jugs with innocent young girls."
* The film ''[[Omar Khayyam (film)|Omar Khayyam]]'', also known as ''The Loves Of Omar Khayyam'', was released in 1957 by Paramount Pictures and includes excerpts from the Rubaiyat.
* In ''[[Back to the Future]]'' the character Lorraine Baines, played by [[Lea Thompson]], is holding a copy of the book in 1955 at the high school when her son Marty McFly is trying to introduce her to his father.
* The Rubaiyat was quoted in the film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' (1995) around 11 minutes in.
* In [[Adrian Lyne]]'s ''[[Unfaithful (2002 film)|Unfaithful]]'' a copy of the text in French is quoted in English: "Drink wine, this is life eternal //This, all that youth will give to you//It is the season for wine, roses//And drunken friends//Be happy for this moment//This moment is your life." The book is a gift given flirtatiously to [[Diane Lane]]'s character by [[Olivier Martinez]] who plays rare book dealer Paul Martel in the film.

===Music===
* The British composer [[Granville Bantock]] produced a choral setting of FitzGerald's translation 1906&amp;ndash;1909.
* Using FitzGerald's translation, the Armenian-American composer [[Alan Hovhaness]] set a dozen of the quatrains to music. This work, ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam'', Op. 308, calls for narrator, orchestra, and solo [[accordion]].
* The Rubaiyat have also influenced Arabic music. In 1950 the Egyptian singer [[Umm Kulthum]] recorded a song entitled "Rubaiyat Al-Khayyam."
* The [[Comedian Harmonists]] in "[[Wochenend und Sonnenschein]]".
* [[Woody Guthrie]] recorded an excerpt of the Rubaiyat set to music that was released on ''[[Hard Travelin' (The Asch Recordings Vol. 3)]]''.
* [[The Human Instinct]]'s album ''[[Pins In It]]'' (1971) opens with a track called "Pinzinet," the lyrics of which are based on the Rubaiyat.
* [[Elektra Records]] released a compilation album named ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary|Rubáiyát]]'' in 1990 to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Elektra Records record label.
* [[Coldcut]] produced an album with a song called "Rubaiyat" on their album ''Let us Play!'' (1997). This song contains what appears to be some words from the English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000003S7Z/ |title=See album |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Jazz-soul harpist [[Dorothy Ashby]]'s 1970 album ''[[The Rubaiyat of Dorothy Ashby]]'' quotes from several of the poem's verses.
* The famed "skull and roses" poster for a [[Grateful Dead]] show at the Avalon Ballroom done by Alton Kelley and Stanley Mouse was adapted from Edmund J. Sullivan's illustrations for ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joel Selvin|Selvin, Joel]]. "[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/03/BAQS111UJ4.DTL Alton Kelley, psychedelic poster creator, dies]". ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. 3 June 2008. Retrieved 2008-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The work influenced the 2004 concept album ''The Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyam'' by the Italian group {{Interlanguage link multi|Milagro acustico|it}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valley-entertainment.com/the-rubaiyyat-of-omar-khayyam.html |title=The Rubaiyyat of Omar Khayyam |work=Valley Entertainment-Hearts of Space Records |accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The song "Beautiful Feeling" by Australian singer-songwriter [[Paul Kelly (Australian musician)|Paul Kelly]], on 2004 album ''[[Ways &amp; Means (album)|Ways and Means]]'', includes the lyrics "A jug of wine, a loaf of bread and thee, lying on a blanket underneath that big old spreading tree." This song was used as the theme song in the 2004 Australian television drama, [[Fireflies (TV series)|Fireflies]].
* The 1953 Robert Wright-George Forrest musical [[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]], adapted from a play by Edward Knoblock, contains a non-singing character, Omar (it is implied that he is the poet himself), who recites some of the couplets in the Fitzgerald translation.
* The record label Ruby Yacht gets its namesake, in part, from the Rubáiyát of Omar [[Milo (musician)|Khayyám.]]
*[[Milo (musician)|milo's]] album ''budding ornithologists are weary of tired analogies'' features a couple of references to the Rubaiyat.

===Television===
* In one 6-episode story arc of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', Bullwinkle finds the "[[Ruby]] [[Yacht]] of Omar Khayyam" in the town of Frostbite Falls (on the shores of [[Veronica Lake]]).  This pun is deemed so bad, the characters groan, and narrator William Conrad quips, "Well, you don't come up with an awful thing like that, and not hit the front page!"
* In the American television drama, ''[[Have Gun - Will Travel]]'', the sixth episode of the sixth season is titled "The Bird of Time." The last lines are the main character, Paladin, quoting from Quatrain VII, "The Bird of Time has but a little way To flutter--and the Bird is on the Wing."
* A copy of the ''Rubaiyat'' plays a role in an episode of the TV series ''[[New Amsterdam (2008 TV series)|New Amsterdam]]'' and is shown to be the inspiration for the name of one of the lead character's children, Omar York.
* In the Australian 2014 television drama, ''[[ANZAC Girls|Anzac Girls]]'', Lieutenant Harry Moffitt reads from the Rubaiyat to his sweetheart, nurse Sister [[Alice Ross-King]].
* In "The Moving Finger" episode of  'I Dream of Jeannie' Jeannie tries out to be a movie star and her screen test is her reciting the Rubaiyat

===Other media===
* In [[Cyberflix]]'s PC game ''[[Titanic: Adventure Out of Time]]'', the object is to save three important items, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s paintings, and a notebook that proves German officials were attempting to gain geo-political advantage by instigating communist [[Russian Revolution of 1917|revolution]]. Two passages from the book are also included in the game as clues to progress the narrative.
* Some versions of the computer game ''[[Colossal Cave Adventure]]'' feature a ruby-covered yacht called "Omar Khayyam" (a pun - the "ruby yacht" of Omar Khayyam).

===Other===
* In Australia, a copy of FitzGerald's translation and its closing words, ''Tamam Shud'' ("Ended") were major components of the unsolved [[Tamam Shud case]].
* The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], through a unanimous opinion written in 2005 by [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines|Associate Justice]] [[Leonardo Quisumbing]], quoted "The Moving Finger" when it ruled that the widow of defeated presidential candidate [[Fernando Poe Jr.]] could not substitute her late husband in his pending election protest against President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], thus leading to the dismissal of the protest.
* There was a real jewel-encrusted copy of the book on the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]''. It had been crafted in 1911 by the firm of [[Sangorski &amp; Sutcliffe]] in London. It was won at a [[Sotheby's]] auction in London on 29 March 1912 for £405 (a bit over $2,000 in 1912) to Gabriel Weis, an American, and was being shipped to New York. The book remains lost at the bottom of the Atlantic to this day.

"'''Six Months in a Leaky Boat'''" is a single from [[New Zealand]] [[art rock]] group [[Split Enz]]'s album ''[[Time and Tide (Split Enz album)|Time and Tide]]''. It was written by [[Tim Finn]] and released as a single in 1982.

The song is a reference to the time it took pioneers to sail to New Zealand (hence the reference to [[Aotearoa]] and "The Tyranny of Distance" - a [[The Tyranny of Distance: How Distance Shaped Australia's History|history]] by [[Geoffrey Blainey]]), and a metaphor that refers to lead singer [[Tim Finn]]'s [[nervous breakdown]].&lt;ref&gt;Ostrander, Ken (April 26, 2012). [http://supergroovydeliciousbite.blogspot.com/2012/04/time-and-tide.html Time and Tide - Split Enz]. super groovy delicious bite&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was "discouraged from airplay" in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the [[Falklands War]] by the [[BBC]] for reasons of morale - it was thought that references to ''leaky boats'' were not appropriate during the naval action in the war.&lt;ref&gt;''The Q Encyclopedia of Rock Stars'' by Dafydd Rees and Luke Crampton, [[Dorling Kindersley]] 1999, page 938&lt;/ref&gt;

==Track listing==
#"Six Months in a Leaky Boat" 4:21
#"Make Sense of It" 3:40

An introductory piece titled "Pioneer", written by [[Eddie Rayner]], appears before the song on the [[Australia]]n and New Zealand release of ''[[History Never Repeats - The Best of Split Enz]]''. This track is not present on the American release. This track also forms an introduction to "Six Months in a Leaky Boat" on its original album release (on ''[[Time and Tide (Split Enz album)|Time and Tide]]'').

{{otheruses|Mysteries (disambiguation)}}
'''''The Mysteries''''' is a version of the medieval English [[mystery plays]] first presented at London's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] in 1977. The cycle of three plays tells the story of the Bible from the creation to the last judgement.

==Background==
It is based largely on the [[Wakefield Cycle|Wakefield cycle]] of plays (but incorporating some scenes from the [[York Mystery Plays|York]],  [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] and [[Coventry Mystery Plays|Coventry]] canons) and adapted by poet [[Tony Harrison]], working with the original cast, into three parts: ''Nativity'', ''The Passion'' and ''Doomsday.'' Directed by [[Bill Bryden]], it was first performed on Easter Saturday 1977 on the terrace of the National Theatre building on the South Bank, London. It then went into the repertoire in the Cottesloe Theatre (part of the South Bank complex) later (in 1985) transferring to the [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum Theatre]]—then in use as a ballroom and so without seating.

Harrison's concept was to present the original stories as [[Story within a story|"plays-within-plays"]], using as his characters the naïve but pious craftsmen and guild members, to some extent modernised to represent the trades of today—God, for example, created the world with the help of a real fork-lift truck—&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|page=86|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;acting out the parts of the story that their  mediaeval counterparts would have done. At the start of each performance actors dressed as tradesmen welcomed the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance was a promenade one, with the audience mingling with the actors and making up the crowd at such scenes as the last judgement. The [[Evening Standard]] reported witnessing "An extraordinary experience... no wonder the end of it all saw an explosion of communal joyousness with everybody, actors, musicians, and audience alike, cheering and clapping and singing and dancing."

Many well known actors appeared in the productions, including [[Brenda Blethyn]], [[Kenneth Cranham]], [[Edna Doré]], [[Lynn Farleigh]], [[Brian Glover]] (as God),  [[Karl Johnson (actor)|Karl Johnson]] (as Jesus), [[Richard Johnson (actor)|Richard Johnson]], [[Mark McManus]], [[Eve Matheson]] (as Eve), [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]] and [[Robert Stephens]] (as Herod). 

The actor and musician [[John Tams]] and his [[Home Service]] band provided the folk music accompaniment and a selection of tracks from it was published on CD.

The 1985 Cottesloe version was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]. A revival of the cycle, again directed by Bryden and featuring some of the original cast, was chosen by the National Theatre to mark the millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fay|first1=Stephen|title=Theatre: The greatest story ever told|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-the-greatest-story-ever-told-1127565.html|accessdate=11 July 2017|work=The Independent|date=21 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The productions won Bill Bryden the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]].

[[Image:Trilith Stonehenge.jpg|left|thumb|Trilith in [[Stonehenge]]]]
[[Image:Malta 16 Mnajdra.jpg|thumb| Trilithon entrance, [[Mnajdra]] temple, [[Malta]]]]

A '''trilithon''' (or ''trilith'') is a structure consisting of two large vertical stones (posts) supporting a third stone set horizontally across the top (lintel). It is commonly used in the context of [[megalithic]] monuments. The most famous trilithons are those of [[Stonehenge]] in [[England]], those found in the [[Megalithic Temples of Malta|Megalithic temples]] of [[Malta]], both of which are [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]s, and the [[Osireion]] in Egypt.

The word ''trilithon'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] "having three stones" (''τρι-/tri-'' 'three' + ''λίθος/lithos'' 'stone') and was first used by [[William Stukeley]].

The term also describes the groups of three stones in the [[Hunebed]] tombs of the [[Netherlands]] and the three massive stones forming part of the wall of the Roman Temple of Jupiter at [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]]. Far from [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]], another famous trilithon is the [[Ha'amonga 'a Maui|Haʻamonga ʻa Maui]] in [[Tonga]], [[Polynesia]].
__NOTOC__
== Baalbek ==
[[File:Trilithon of Baalbek 3.jpg|thumb|The 3 blocks known as trilithon in Temple of Jupiter Baal ("Heliopolitan Zeus") in Baalbek, Lebanon.]]
A group of three horizontally lying giant stones, which form part of the podium of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Temple of Jupiter (Roman Heliopolis)|Jupiter temple]] of [[Baalbek]], [[Lebanon]], are called a "Trilithon", although they do not fit the above definition. The location of the megalithic structures is atop of a hill in the region, known as Tel Baalbek. Numerous archaeological expeditions have gone to the site starting in the 19th century, primarily German and French groups, and research continued into the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://gilgamesh42.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/moving-the-stones-of-baalbek-the-wonders-of-roman-engineering/|title = Moving the Stones of Baalbek–The Wonders of Roman Engineering|last = Adair|first = Aaron|website = Fleeing Nergal, Seeking Stars|access-date = 2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each one of these stones is 19 metres long, 4.2 metres high, 3.6 metres thick and weighs around 800 tonnes.  The supporting stone layer beneath features a number of stones which weigh an estimated 350 tonnes and are 11 metres wide.&lt;ref name="Adam 1977, 52"&gt;{{harvnb|Adam|1977|p = 52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[quarry]] nearby, [[Stone of the Pregnant Woman|two Roman building blocks]], which were intended for the same podium, surpass 1,000 tonnes. They have not been used since their extraction in ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ruprechtsberger|1999|pp=7–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2313">'''Upper Town''' ({{lang-el|Άνω Πόλη}}, ''Ano Poli'') is the [[old town]] of [[Thessaloniki]], located around the city's [[acropolis]], north of the city center.

[[File:Thessalonikki, Macedonia, Greece779.jpg|thumb|180px|Street beside the walls]]
he Upper Town is the most traditional part of the city, as it preserves much of the Byzantine and Ottoman era city fabric, otherwise destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Thessaloniki|great fire]] of 1917. Thus it features small stone-paved streets, old squares and houses in traditional Greek and [[Ottoman architecture]]. The Upper Town is the highest part of the city, and dominated by the acropolis, the Byzantine and Ottoman-era fort known as [[Heptapyrgion (Thessaloniki)|Heptapyrgion]]. The remaining [[Walls of Thessaloniki|city walls]] still ring the Upper Town, with many of its additional Ottoman and Byzantine structures still standing. The [[Church of Prophet Elijah (Thessaloniki)|church of Profitis Elias]], the [[Church of Saint Nicholas Orphanos]],  the [[Byzantine Bath (Thessaloniki)|Byzantine bath]], the [[Church of Saint Catherine, Thessaloniki|Church of Saint Catherine]], such as the [[Atatürk Museum (Thessaloniki)|Atatürk Museum]] and the [[Alaca Imaret Mosque]] are also in the Upper Town. During the Ottoman period it was the main district of the Turks (Muslims) of the city, while the Greeks, western Europeans and the Jews were living around the [[Port of Thessaloniki|port]].

On clear days [[Mount Olympus]], at about 100&amp;nbsp;km (62&amp;nbsp;mi) away across the gulf, can also be seen towering the horizon.

'''Vera von Falkenhausen''' (born 1938) is a German [[Byzantinist]] who lives and works in Italy.

== Life ==
Vera von Falkenhausen pursued Byzantine studies at the [[University of Munich]], where she made her thesis in 1966 under [[Hans-Georg Beck]]. She then spent the years 1968–70 at the [[Dumbarton Oaks Center for Byzantine Studies]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on a scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/fellows/1940-2004/fellows Byzantine Fellows List, 1940 to 2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315092619/http://www.doaks.org/research/byzantine/fellows/1940-2004/fellows |date=2016-03-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970 she has been a member of the [[German Historical Institute in Rome]]. Since 1974 she has been active as a professor of Byzantine history and literature at the universities of [[University of Pisa|Pisa]], [[University of Basilicata|Basilicata (Potenza)]], [[University of Chieti-Pescara|Chieti]], and finally at [[University of Rome Tor Vergata|Rome Tor Vergata]]. Since 2007 she is a professor emerita.

Her field of research are the various aspects of Byzantine rule in [[southern Italy]] and [[Sicily]]. Much of her work has been devoted to the analysis and critical edition of Greek primary sources. Since 2006 she is the editor of the ''Archivio storico per la Calabria e la Lucania'', founded in 1931 by [[Paolo Orsi]] and [[Umberto Zanotti Bianco]], on behalf of the [[Associazione Nazionale per gli Interessi del Mezzogiorno d'Italia]]. In addition, she is a member of the scientific advisory council of the journal ''Nea Rhome'', founded in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nea-rhome.uniroma2.it/en/people/ ''Νέα Ῥώμη. Rivista di ricerche bizantinistiche'' - People]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2012 she was the chair of the [[Associazione Italiana di Studi Bizantini]].
