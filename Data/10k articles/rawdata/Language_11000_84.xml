'''Abanyom''', or '''Bakor''', is a language of the [[Ekoid languages|Ekoid]] subfamily of [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo]].   It is spoken by the Abanyom people in the [[Cross River State]] region of [[Nigeria]].  A member of the [[Southern Bantoid languages|Southern Bantoid]] group, Abanyom is fairly closely related to the [[Bantu languages]]. It is [[tone (linguistics)|tonal]] and has a typical Niger–Congo [[noun class]] system.

'''Alsatian''' ('''Alsatian''' and {{lang-gsw|Elsässerditsch}} (''Alsatian German''); ''[[Lorraine Franconian|Frankish]]'': ''Elsässerdeitsch''; {{lang-fr|Alsacien}}; {{lang-de|Elsässisch}} or ''{{lang|de|Elsässerdeutsch}}'') is a [[Low Alemannic German]] dialect spoken in most of [[Alsace]], a formerly disputed region in eastern France that has passed between French and German control five times since 1681. A dialect of Alsatian German is spoken in the United States by the so-called [[Swiss Amish]], whose ancestors emigrated there in the middle of the 19th century. The approximately 7,000 speakers are located mainly in [[Allen County, Indiana]], with "daughter settlements"{{ref|a|[Note 1]}} elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Thompson: ''The Languages of the Amish of Allen County, Indiana: Multilingualism and Convergence'', in Anthropological Linguistics, Vol. 36, No. 1 (Spring, 1994), pp. 69-91&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language family==
[[Image:Rue du Sauvage.JPG|thumb|left|175px|A bilingual ([[French language|French]] and Alsatian) sign in [[Mulhouse]].]]
Alsatian is closely related to other nearby [[Alemannic German|Alemannic dialects]], such as [[Swiss German]], [[Swabian German|Swabian]], and [[Markgräflerisch]] as well as [[Kaiserstühlerisch]]. It is often confused with [[Lorraine Franconian]], a more distantly related [[Franconian languages|Franconian]] dialect spoken in the northwest corner of Alsace and in neighbouring [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]]. Like other dialects and languages, Alsatian has also been influenced by outside sources. Words of [[Yiddish]] origin can be found in Alsatian, and modern conversational Alsatian includes adaptations of French words and English words, especially concerning new technologies.

Many speakers of Alsatian could, if necessary, write in reasonable [[standard German]]. For most this would be rare and confined to those who have learned German at school or through work. As with other dialects, various factors determine when, where, and with whom one might converse in Alsatian. Some dialect speakers are unwilling to speak standard German, at times, to certain outsiders and prefer to use French. In contrast, many people living near the border with [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], will speak their dialect with a Swiss person from that area, as they are mutually intelligible for the most part; similar habits may apply to conversations with people of the nearby German [[Markgräflerland]]. Some street names in Alsace may use Alsatian spellings (they were formerly displayed only in French but are now bilingual in some places, especially [[Strasbourg]] and [[Mulhouse]]).

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Alsatian has a set of 19 consonants:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! !! [[Labial consonant|Labial]] !! [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]] !! [[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]] !! [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]] !! [[Velar consonant|Velar]] !! [[Uvular consonant|Uvular]] !! [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]
|-
! [[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]
| {{IPA|m}} || {{IPA|n}} || || || {{IPA|ŋ}} || ||
|-
! [[Stop consonant|Stop]]
| {{IPA|b̥}} || {{IPA|d̥}} || || || {{IPA|ɡ̊}}, {{IPA|kʰ}} || ||
|-
! [[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]
| {{IPA|pf}} || {{IPA|ts}} || {{IPA|tʃ}} || || || ||
|-
! [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]
| {{IPA|f}} || {{IPA|s}} || {{IPA|ʃ}} || {{IPA|ç}} || ({{IPA|x}}) ||  || {{IPA|h}}
|-
! [[Sonorant]]
| {{IPA|ʋ}} || {{IPA|l}} || || {{IPA|j}} || || {{IPA|ʁ̞ }} ||
|}

Three consonants are restricted in their distribution: {{IPA|/kʰ/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} only occur at the beginning of a word or morpheme, and then only if followed immediately by a vowel; {{IPA|/ŋ/}} never occurs at the beginning of a word or morpheme.

Alsatian, like some German dialects, has [[lenition|lenited]] all [[obstruent]]s but {{IPA|[k]}}. Its [[lenis|lenes]] are, however, [[voice (phonetics)|voiceless]] as in all Southern German varieties. Therefore, they are here transcribed {{IPA|/b̥/}}, {{IPA|/d̥/}}, {{IPA|/ɡ̊/}}.

The phoneme {{IPA|/ç/}} has a velar allophone {{IPA|[x]}} after back vowels ({{IPA|/u/}}, {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɔ/}}, and {{IPA|/a/}} in those speakers who do not pronounce this as {{IPA|[æ]}}), and palatal {{IPA|[ç]}} elsewhere. In southern dialects, there is a tendency to pronounce it {{IPA|/x/}} in all positions, and in Strasbourg the palatal allophone tends to conflate with the phoneme {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

===Vowels===
Short vowels: {{IPA|/ʊ/, /o/, /ɒ/, /a/}} ({{IPA|[æ]}} in Strasbourg), {{IPA|/ɛ/, /ɪ/, /i/, /y/}}.

Long vowels: {{IPA|/ʊː/, /oː/, /ɒː/, /aː/, /ɛː/, /eː/, /iː/, /yː/}}

==Status of Alsatian in France==
Since 1992, the constitution of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] states that [[French language|French]] is the official language of the Republic. However, Alsatian, along with other [[regional language]]s, is recognized by the [[French government]] in the official list of [[languages of France]].  France is a signatory to the  [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] but has never ratified the law and has not given regional languages the support that would be required by the charter.  The policies of the Paris government have had the deliberate effect of greatly weakening the prevalence of native languages in France that are not "French."{{fact|date=July 2018}}  As a result, the Alsatian dialect of German has gone from being the prevalent language of the region to one in decline.  A 1999 [[INSEE]] [[Statistical survey|survey]] counted 548,000 adult speakers of Alsatian in [[France]], making it the second most-spoken regional language in the country (after [[Occitan language|Occitan]]). Like all regional languages in France, however, the transmission of Alsatian is on the decline. While 43% of the adult population of Alsace speaks Alsatian, its use has been largely declining amongst the youngest generations.

'''Anders Olsson''' (born  19 June 1949) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[writer]], [[professor]] of [[literature]] at [[Stockholm University]], literary critic and member of the [[Swedish Academy]].

Olsson has written some 15 books on [[poetry]] and the [[history of literature]]; together with his friend and ally [[Horace Engdahl]] he was a key introducer of the work of [[Jacques Derrida]] and other post-structuralist thinkers into Swedish literary research and criticism.  His [[doctoral dissertation]] on Swedish poet and essayist [[Gunnar Ekelöf]] was published in 1983 and met with mostly favourable reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskaakademien.se/Templates/News1.aspx?PageID=0915a1a3-fdb6-4110-b7d3-6287383bb14c Anders Olsson : Ny ledamot i Svenska Akademien]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, press release of 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed professor of literature at Stockholm University in 2004 and his research interests include the development of modern literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.svenskaakademien.se/svenska-akademien/de-aderton/stol-nr-4-anders-olsson|title=Stol nr 4 - Anders Olsson|last=|first=|date=|website=Svenska Akademien|language=sv|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olsson was member of the ''[[Kris (magazine)|Kris]]'' editorial staff.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svenskaakademien.se/svenska-akademien/de-aderton/stol-nr-4-anders-olsson&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Olson was elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]], by secret ballot to succeed poet and writer [[Lars Forssell]] who died in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=1058&amp;a=745419 Anders Olsson ny ledamot i Svenska akademien] {{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, Dagens Nyheter, 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and he formally took his seat in the 18-member assembly on 20 December 2008.

'''Astrid Anna Emilia Lindgren''' (née '''Ericsson'''; {{IPA-sv|ˈasːtrɪd ˈlɪŋːɡreːn|lang|sv-Astrid Lindgren.ogg}}; 14 November 1907&amp;nbsp;– 28 January 2002) was a Swedish writer of fiction and screenplays. She is best known for several [[children's book]] series, featuring [[Pippi Longstocking]], [[Emil i Lönneberga]], [[Karlsson-on-the-Roof]], and [[the Six Bullerby Children]] (''Children of Noisy Village'' in the US), and for the [[children's fantasy]] novels ''[[Mio, My Son]]'', ''[[Ronia the Robber's Daughter]]'', and ''[[The Brothers Lionheart]]''. In January 2017, she was calculated to be the world's 18th most translated author,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://databases.unesco.org/xtrans/stat/xTransStat.a?VL1=A&amp;top=50&amp;lg=0 |title=UNESCO's statistics on whole Index Translationum database |publisher=Databases.unesco.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fourth most translated children's writer after [[Enid Blyton]], [[Hans Christian Andersen|H.&amp;nbsp;C.

==Biography==
[[File:Astrid Lindgren 1924.jpg|thumb|right| Lindgren in 1924]]
Astrid Lindgren grew up in Näs, near [[Vimmerby]], [[Småland]], Sweden, and many of her books are based on her family and childhood memories and landscapes.

Lindgren was the daughter of Samuel August Ericsson (1875–1969) and Hanna Jonsson (1879–1961). She had two sisters, {{ill|Stina Hergin|lt=Stina|sv}} and {{ill|Ingegerd Lindström|lt=Ingegerd|sv}}, and a brother, {{ill|Gunnar Ericsson (Centre Party)|lt=Gunnar Ericsson|sv|Gunnar Ericsson (centerpolitiker)}}, who eventually became a member of the [[Swedish parliament]].

Upon finishing school, Lindgren took a job with a local newspaper in Vimmerby. She had a relationship with the chief editor, who was married and a father, and who eventually proposed marriage in 1926 after she became pregnant. She declined and moved to the capital city of Stockholm, learning to become a typist and [[stenographer]] (she would later write most of her drafts in stenography). In due time, she gave birth to her son, Lars, in [[Copenhagen]] and left him in the care of a foster family.

Although poorly paid, she saved whatever she could and traveled as often as possible to Copenhagen to be with Lars, often just over a weekend, spending most of her time on the train back and forth. Eventually, she managed to bring Lars home, leaving him in the care of her parents until she could afford to raise him in Stockholm.

In 1932 she married her employer, Sture Lindgren (1898–1952), who left his wife for her. Three years later, in 1934, Lindgren gave birth to her second child, Karin, who would become a translator. The character Pippi Longstocking was invented for her daughter to amuse her while she was ill in bed. Lindgren later related that Karin had suddenly said to her, "Tell me a story about Pippi Longstocking," and the tale was created in response to that request.

The family moved in 1941 to an apartment on [[:sv:Dalagatan|Dalagatan]], with a view over [[Vasaparken, Stockholm|Vasaparken]], where Lindgren remained until her death on 28 January 2002 at the age of 94, having  become blind.&lt;ref&gt;Source – Steinar Mæland.{{full citation needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrid Lindgren died in her home in [[central Stockholm]]. Her funeral took place in the [[Storkyrkan]] (Great Church) in [[Gamla stan]]. Among those attending were King [[Carl XVI Gustaf]] with Queen Silvia and others of the royal family, and Prime Minister [[Göran Persson]]. The ceremony was described as "the closest you can get to a [[state funeral]]."&lt;ref&gt;Hagerfors, Anna-Maria (2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Lindgren worked as a journalist and secretary before becoming a full-time author. She served as a secretary for the [[1933 Swedish Summer Grand Prix]].

In 1944 Lindgren won second prize in a competition held by [[Rabén &amp; Sjögren]], a new publishing house, with the novel ''Britt-Marie lättar sitt hjärta'' (''Britt-Marie Unburdens Her Heart''). A year later she won first prize in the same competition with the [[chapter book]] ''Pippi Långstrump'' (''[[Pippi Longstocking]]''), which had been rejected by [[Bonniers]]. (Rabén &amp; Sjögren published it with illustrations by [[Ingrid Vang Nyman]], the latter's debut in Sweden.) Since then it has become one of the most beloved children's books in the world and has been translated into 60 languages.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} While Lindgren almost immediately became a much appreciated writer, the irreverent attitude towards adult authority that is a distinguishing characteristic of many of her characters has occasionally drawn the ire of some conservatives.{{clarify|date=August 2013|reason=when and where? in Sweden? needs source}}

The [[women's magazine]] ''[[Damernas Värld]]'' sent Lindgren to the United States in 1948 to write short essays. Upon arrival she is said to have been upset by the [[discrimination against black Americans]]. A few years later she published the book ''[[Kati (book series)#Kati in America|Kati in America]]'', a collection of short essays inspired by the trip.

In 1956, the inaugural year of the [[Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis]], the German-language edition of ''Mio, min Mio'' (''[[Mio, My Son]]'') won the Children's book award.&lt;ref name=djlp/&gt;&lt;ref name=djlp–1956/&gt; (Sixteen books written by Astrid Lindgren made the Children's Book and Picture Book longlist, 1956–1975, but only ''Mio, My Son'' won a prize in its category.)&lt;ref name=djlp-lindgren/&gt;

In 1958 Lindgren received the second [[Hans Christian Andersen Medal]] for ''[[Rasmus på luffen]]'' (''Rasmus and the Vagabond''), a 1956 novel developed from her screenplay and filmed in 1955. The biennial [[International Board on Books for Young People]], now considered the highest lifetime recognition available to creators of children's books, soon came to be called the Little Nobel Prize. Prior to 1962 the Board cited a single book published during the preceding two years.&lt;ref name=andersen/&gt;&lt;ref name=ibby-lindgren/&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2015}}

On her 90th birthday, she was pronounced [[International Swede of the Year]] 1997 by Swedes in the World (SVIV{{snd}}{{ill|Svenskar i Världen|sv}}), an association for [[Swedes living abroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ASTRID LINDGREN – ÅRETS SVENSK I VÄRLDEN 1997 (Astrid Lindgren – Swedes of the World, Swede of the Year 1997) |url=http://www.sviv.se/uppdrag/arets-svensk-i-varlden/astrid-lindgren-arets-svensk-i-varlden–1997/ |website=SVIV.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its entry on [[Scandinavia]]n [[fantasy]], ''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'' named Lindgren the foremost Swedish contributor to modern children's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=John-Henri |first=Holmberg |author-link=John-Henri Holmberg |contribution=Scandinavia |year=1997 |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |editor-last=Clute |editor-first=John |editor1-link=JohnClute |editor2-last=Grant |editor2-first=John |editor2-link= ohn Grant (author) |page=841 |place=New York |publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] |title-link=The Encyclopedia of Fantast}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its entry on Lindgren summed up her work in glowing terms: "Her niche in children's fantasy remains both secure and exalted. Her stories and images can never be forgotten."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=John-Henri |first=Holmberg |author-link=John-Henri Holmberg |contribution=Lindgren, Astrid (Anna Emilia) |year=1997 |title=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy |editor-last=Clute |editor-first=John, and John Grant |page=582 |place=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |title-link=The Encyclopedia of Fantasy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations==
By 2012 Astrid Lindgren's books had been translated into 95 different languages and language variants. Further, the first chapter of ''Ronja the Robber's Daughter'' has been translated into [[Latin language|Latin]]. Up until 1997 a total of 3,000 editions of her books had been issued internationally,&lt;ref&gt;Anette Øster Steffensen (2003): "Two Versions of the Same Narrative{{nbsp}}– Astrid Lindgren's Mio, min Mio in Swedish and Danish".&lt;/ref&gt; and globally her books had sold a total of 150 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;"Astrid Lindgren och världen". Astridlindgren.se&lt;/ref&gt; Many of her books have been translated into English by the translator Joan Tate.

==Politics==

In 1976 a scandal arose in Sweden when it was publicised that Lindgren's [[marginal tax rate]] had risen to 102 percent. This was to be known as the "[[Pomperipossa in Monismania|Pomperipossa effect]]", from a story she published in ''[[Expressen]] on 3 March 1976,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrid-lindgren.com/astridlindgren/Ldates/1974–1976.htm |title=Astrid Lindgren timeline, 1974–76 |publisher=Astrid-lindgren.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; entitled ''[[Pomperipossa in Monismania]]'', attacking the government and its taxation policies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Scandinavian Crime Fiction |last=Stougaard-Nielsen |first=Jakob |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2017 |isbn=9781472522757 |location=London |pages=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a satirical allegory in response to the marginal tax rate Lindgren had incurred in 1976,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Swedish God |last=Biro |first=Jan |publisher=Homulus Foundation |year=2009 |isbn=9780984210305 |location=Los angeles |pages=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; which required self-employed individuals to pay both regular [[income tax]] and employers' deductions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a stormy tax debate, she attracted criticism from Social Democrats and even from her own colleagues, and responded by raising the issue of the lack of women involved in the Social Democrats' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Astrid Lindgren: The Woman Behind Pippi Longstocking |last=Andersen |first=Jens |publisher=Yale University Press |year=2018 |isbn=9780300226102 |location=New Haven |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Swedish general election, 1976|that year's general election]], the [[Social Democrats (Sweden)|Social Democratic]] government was voted out for the first time in 44 years, and the Lindgren tax debate was one of several controversies that may have contributed to the result. Another controversy involved [[Ingmar Bergman]]'s farewell letter to Sweden, after charges had been made against him of tax evasion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lindgren nevertheless remained a Social Democrat for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Clas Barkmanclas.barkman@dn.se |url=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/brev-fran-astrid-lindgren-visar-hennes-stod-for-s |title=Brev från Astrid Lindgren visar hennes stöd för S – |publisher=Dn.se |date=2010-05–16 |accessdate=2014-02–22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018092713/http://www.dn.se/dnbok/dnbok-hem/brev-fran-astrid-lindgren-visar-hennes-stod-for-s |archivedate=18 October 2012 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lindgren was well known both for her support for [[children's rights|children's]] and [[animal rights]] and for her opposition to [[corporal punishment]]. In 1994 she received the [[Right Livelihood Award]], "For her commitment to justice, non-violence and understanding of minorities as well as her love and caring for nature."

==Honors and memorials==
[[File:Astrid Lindgren 2011.jpg|thumb| Lindgren represented in the Villa Villekulla exhibit at Kneippbyn in [[Visby]]]]

In 1967 the publisher [[Rabén &amp; Sjögren]] established an annual [[literary prize]], the Astrid Lindgren Prize, to mark her 60th birthday. The prize, 40,000 [[Swedish kronor]], is awarded to a Swedish-language children's writer every year on Lindgren's birthday in November.

Following Lindgren's death, the [[government of Sweden]] instituted the [[Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award]] in her memory. The award is the world's largest monetary award for children's and youth literature, in the amount of five million Swedish kronor.

The collection of Astrid Lindgren's original manuscripts in [[Kungliga Biblioteket]] in Stockholm (the Royal Library) was placed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=List of Registered Heritage: Astrid Lindgren Archives |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/memory-of-the-world/register/full-list-of-registered-heritage/registered-heritage-page–1/astrid-lindgren-archives/ |website=UNESCO.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2011 Sweden's central bank [[Sveriges Riksbank]] announced that Lindgren's portrait will feature on the 20&amp;nbsp;[[Swedish krona|kronor]] banknote, beginning in 2014–15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=46685 |title=Sveriges Riksbank |publisher=The Riksbank |date=2011-09-30 |accessdate=2014-02–22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172146/http://www.riksbank.com/templates/Page.aspx?id=46685 |archivedate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the announcement of the persons who would feature on the new banknotes, Lindgren's name had been the one most often put forward in the public debate.

===Asteroid Lindgren===
Asteroid [[3204 Lindgren]], discovered in 1978 by Soviet astronomer [[Nikolai Chernykh]], was named after her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?q=3204+Lindgren+1978+RH |title=Dictionary of Minor Planet Names – p.256 |date= |accessdate=2014-02–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the Swedish [[miniaturized satellite|microsatellite]] [[Astrid (satellites)|Astrid 1]], launched on 24&amp;nbsp;January 1995, was originally selected only as a common [[Swedish name days|Swedish female name]], but within a short time it was decided to name the instruments after characters in Astrid Lindgren's books: PIPPI (Prelude in Planetary Particle Imaging), EMIL (Electron Measurements&amp;nbsp;– In-situ and Lightweight), and MIO (Miniature Imaging Optics).

===Astrid's Wellspring===
[[File:Sagornas död.jpg|thumb|''Källa Astrid'' (Astrid's Wellspring) by Berit Lindfeldt]]
In memory of Astrid Lindgren, a memorial sculpture was created next to her childhood home, named ''Källa Astrid'' ("Astrid's Wellspring" in English). It is situated at the spot where Astrid Lindgren first heard [[fairy tales]]. The sculpture consists of an artistic representation of a young person's head (1.37&amp;nbsp;m high),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindaposten.se/article/articleview/23590/1/13/ "Källa Astrid" på Astrids källa "Astrid's Wellspring [source of inspiration&amp;#93; in Astrid's Wellspring"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828140019/http://www.kindaposten.se/article/articleview/23590/1/13/ |date=28 August 2010 }}. [http://www.kindaposten.se/ettan Kinda-Posten]{{sv icon}}. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091112161914/http://www.kindaposten.se/ettan |date=12 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; flattened on top, in the corner of a square pond, and, just above the water, a ring of rosehip thorn (with a single rosehip bud attached to it). The sculpture was initially slightly different in design and intended to be part of a fountain set in the city center, but the people of Vimmerby vehemently opposed the idea. Furthermore, Astrid Lindgren had stated that she never wanted to be represented as a statue. (However, there is a statue of Lindgren in the city center.) The memorial was sponsored by the culture council of Vimmerby.

Lindgren's childhood home is near the statue and open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astridlindgrensnas.se |title=Vălkommen Till Astrid Lindgrens Năs |publisher=Astridlindgrensnas.se |date= |accessdate=2014-02–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just {{convert|100|m|ft}} from Astrid's Wellspring is a museum in her memory. The author is buried in Vimmerby where the [[Astrid Lindgren's World]] theme park is also located. The children's museum [[Junibacken]], in Stockholm, was opened in June 1996 with the main theme of the permanent exhibition being devoted to Astrid Lindgren; at the heart of the museum is a theme train ride through the world of Astrid Lindgren's novels.

'''Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting''' is an [[italic script]] developed in the late 20th century by Nan Jay Barchowsky, similar to the [[Getty-Dubay]] script. The letter forms of the print version taught to young children are very similar to the semi-connected cursive forms taught to older children, making the transition easier.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|Religion}}
'''Ben Sira''', or '''Ben Sirach''' ({{Lang-he-n|בן סירא}}), also known as '''Shimon ben Yeshua ben Eliezer ben Sira''' or '''Jesus Ben Sirach''', (fl. 2nd century BCE) was a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] scribe, sage, and allegorist from Jerusalem. He is the author of the [[Sirach|Book of Sirach]], also known as the Book of Ecclesiasticus. 

He wrote his work in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], possibly in [[Alexandria]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] ca. 180–175 BCE, where he is thought to have established a school.&lt;ref&gt;See Guillaume, Philippe, [http://www.jhsonline.org/Articles/article_39.pdf ''New Light on the Nebiim from Alexandria: A Chronography to Replace the Deuteronomistic History''. PDF] Journal of Hebrew Scriptures 5.9 (2004): sections 3-5: full notes and bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators{{who?|date=August 2015}} claim Ben Sira was a contemporary of [[Simon the Just]] (Shim`on HaTzadik),&lt;ref&gt;{{daat enc|id1=1464 |he-title=אנציקלופדיה יהודית דעת - בן סירא |access-date=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it is more likely that his contemporary was [[Simon II (High Priest)|High Priest Simon II]] (219–199 BCE).

A medieval text, the [[Alphabet of Sirach]], has been attributed to Ben Sira.

==Name==
In the Greek text of the Book of Sirach, the author's father is called "Jesus the son of Sirach of Jerusalem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05263a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-05-01 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=September 2017}} [[Jesus (name)|Jesus]] is the Anglicized form of the Greek name Ἰησοῦς, the equivalent of the [[Aramaic]] borrowed from [[Late Biblical Hebrew]] "[[Yeshua|Yeshua`]]", derived from the older [[Masoretic]] [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] "Yehoshua`".

The copy owned by [[Saadia Gaon]], the prominent rabbi, Jewish philosopher, and exegete of the 10th century CE, had the reading "Shim`on, son of Yeshua`, son of El`azar ben Sira"; and a similar reading occurs in the Hebrew manuscript B.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

''Sirach'' is the Greek form of the family name Sira. It adds the letter [[Chi (letter)|Chi]], an addition like that in Hakel-dama-ch in Acts 1:19.

==Life==
According to the Greek version, though not according to the Syriac, the author traveled extensively (xxxiv. 11){{incomplete citation|date=August 2015}} and was frequently in danger of death (ib. verse 12){{incomplete citation|date=August 2015}}. In the hymn of chapter li{{incomplete citation|date=August 2015}}, he speaks of the perils of all sorts from which God had delivered him, although this is probably only a poetic theme in imitation of the [[Psalms]]. The calumnies to which he was exposed in the presence of a certain king, supposed to be one of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], are mentioned only in the Greek version, being ignored both in the Syriac and in the Hebrew text. The only fact known with certainty, drawn from the text itself, is that Ben Sira was a scholar, and a scribe thoroughly versed in the Law, and especially in the "Books of Wisdom."

==Grandson==
Very little is known about his grandson, who claims in the text to be the translator of Sirach into Greek. He probably did the translation many years later after the original was written.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

The Prologue in the Greek text, attributed to him, is generally considered the earliest witness to a canon of the books of the prophets.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

The grandson states that he came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes. [[Ptolemy VIII of Egypt|Ptolemy VIII Euergetes]] must be intended; he ascended the throne in the year 170 BCE, together with his brother Philometor, but he soon became sole ruler of [[Cyrene, Libya|Cyrene]], and from 146 to 117 BCE held sway over all Egypt. He dated his reign from the year in which he received the crown (i.e., from 170 BCE). The translator must therefore have gone to Egypt in 132 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Strategic Grasp of the Bible|first=J. Sidlow |last=Baxter|authorlink=J.

A '''breakout box''' is a critical piece of electrical test equipment used to support [[integration testing]], expedite maintenance, and streamline the troubleshooting process at the system, subsystem, and component level by simplifying the access to test signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.l2aviation.com/breakout_box_avionics.htm/ |title=Breakout Boxes |publisher=L2 Consulting Services, Inc |year=2007 |accessdate=29 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101233532/http://www.l2aviation.com/breakout_box_avionics.htm |archivedate=1 November 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Breakout boxes span a wide spectrum of functionality: (i) some serve to break out every signal connection coming into a unit while others breakout only specific signals commonly monitored for either testing or troubleshooting purposes; and some are used on [[electrical connector]]s and others are used on [[optical fiber connector]]s.

== Overview ==
A breakout box serves as a troubleshooting tool to determine the wiring of an [[electrical connector]] interface on a networking device or computer. Typically, a breakout box is  inserted between two electrical devices to determine which signal or power interconnects are active. Breakout boxes are extremely useful in troubleshooting connection problems resulting from manufacturing errors (e.g., miswiring) or defective interconnects resulting from broken wiring. Breakout boxes are specific examples of a more general category of network testing equipment called "status monitors".

A variety of these monitoring devices are available for testing serial interfaces, including [[RS-232]], [[RS-449]], [[V.35 (recommendation)|V.35]], and [[X.21]], as well as specialty interfaces. They generally come with a variety of connectors and are quick and easy to use for isolating problems with serial transmission connections in networking, telecommunications, and industrial settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenetworkencyclopedia.com/d2.asp?ref=258 |title=Breakout Boxes |publisher=The Network Encyclopedia  |date=  |accessdate=29 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KL Break Out Box RS-232.jpg|thumb|Example of a pocket-sized [[RS-232]] breakout box that features switches to reconfigure or patch any or all the active circuitry. This unit has one DB25 male and one DB25 female [[RS-232]] connector]]

The term ''breakout box'' is derived from the mechanical enclosure in which a connector's aggregate connections are separated (i.e., broken out) into individual signal or current carrying wires or cables. Often, if there are only a few connections, then a breakout cable (also called an ''octopus cable'') may be used, as is common on [[notebook computer]]s.

The most common breakout boxes use [[D-subminiature]] connectors (sometimes referred to as D-sub connectors and sometimes erroneously as DB connectors) and are configured with both male and female [[D-subminiature variants|DE-9, DA-15, DB-25, DC-37 or DD-50]] standard density connectors and related test points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://breakoutboxes.3dcartstores.com/assets/images/bobdss/SE15009_D-SS_DATA_SHEET_REV-1.pdf |title=D-SS Series Breakout Box |publisher=Silver Engineering, Inc. |date=27 Jan 2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These units can also be used to simulate special cables, interconnect [[RS-232]] devices, or adapt test equipment to an RS-232 device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dgtech.com/product/hdbreakout/hdbreakout.php |title=Heavy Duty Breakout Boxes |publisher=DG Technologies, Inc. |year=2012 |accessdate=29 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813092040/http://www.dgtech.com/product/hdbreakout/hdbreakout.php |archivedate=13 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Breakout boxes for post-production studio editing suites.'' Breakout boxes (also called patch bays or [[patch panel]]s) are used to patch audio/video output signals from multiple sources and connect them to other devices quickly.  These boxes range from simple analog audio interconnects with up to 96 audio ins/outs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.audiolot.com/proaudio/sales/audiolot/mixbay/audiolotmixbay-manual.pdf |title=AudioLot Mixbay |publisher=audiolot records  |date= |accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to complex plug-in component with composite video, S-Video, HDMI, RS422 control, and digital signaling.
* ''Industrial I/O breakout box.'' A piece of [[electronic test equipment]] used for [[diagnosis|diagnosing]] problems in [[computer communications]], typically over a [[serial port]].  The breakout box sits between two pieces of equipment and usually has some LEDs to display the status of the different signals in the serial cable.  It will also often have [[DIP switch]]es to let the user connect or disconnect different signals in the cable, and it will usually have connector pins that let the user short pins together using electrical [[jumper (computing)|jumpers]], or gain access to individual signal lines with an oscilloscope or other test equipment.
* ''[[RS-232]] breakout box:'' Typically,  RS-232 breakout boxes offer complete control of RS-232 interface, test, re-wire and open signal lines. These devices are pocket-sized for circuit testing, monitoring and patching. The usually provide 10 interface signal powered [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s to permanently monitor TD, RD, RTS, CTS, DSR, CD, TC, RC, DTR (E) TC signals, as well as enabling the breakout of individual circuits or reconfiguration or patching any or all of the 24 active switch positions.
* [[Personal computer]] [[sound card]]s.  A [[D-sub|DA15]] connector on the outside of the board is often broken out into [[DIN connector]]s for [[MIDI]].  Some professional audio applications use [[rackmount]] breakout boxes.  A [[patch panel]] can also function as a breakout box, in the case of multi-channel DB25 (or other) connectors used for [[multi-track recording]].
* [[Docking station]]s for notebook computers. These draw the signal for multiple connectors from the pins of one connector.
* [[Electronic control unit]]s (ECUs) in automotive engines have proprietary connectors that are densely packed, environmentally sealed and difficult to gain access to without causing damage. The manufacturer sometimes provides a breakout box to allow service engineers to test the unit.

[[Malay titles|Dato' Sri]] '''Bung Moktar bin Radin''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: بوڠ موكتر بن رادين; born 15 September 1959) is a Malaysian politician. He is currently the Member of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] for the [[Kinabatangan (federal constituency)|Kinabatangan]] constituency in [[Sabah]], representing the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) party in the opposition [[Barisan Nasional]] (BN) coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlimen.gov.my/index.php?modload=ahlidewan&amp;uweb=dr&amp;action=details&amp;id=158|title=Bung Moktar bin Radin, Y.B. Datuk|publisher=[[Parliament of Malaysia]]|language=Malay|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy and criticism ==
Over four terms in Parliament, Bung Moktar earned a reputation for controversial remarks and inflammatory behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2009/12/20/bung-moktar-finally-admits-marrying-zizie/|title=Bung Moktar finally admits marrying Zizie|author1=Lee Yuk Peng|author2=Wahida Asrani|publisher=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]|date=20 December 2009|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Speech offended opposition MPs===
In the first sitting of Parliament after the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 election]], he called opposition politician [[Karpal Singh]] a "big [[monkey]]" after Singh called him "[[big foot]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-33319220080430|title=Malaysia opens new parliament sitting amid chaos|publisher=[[Reuters]] India|date=30 April 2008|accessdate=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2007, he apologised for making sexist remarks in Parliament about opposition politician [[Fong Po Kuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=262665|title=MPs Apologise For Sexist Remark in Parliament|publisher=[[Bernama]]|date=18 May 2007|accessdate=3 April 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629115925/http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=262665|archivedate=29 June 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 20 April 2010, he pleaded guilty to committing [[polygamy]] by taking a second wife, Malaysian actress Zizie Izette, without the consent of a marriage registrar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/04/20/bung-mokhtar-pleads-guilty-to-polygamy-without-consent/|title=Bung Mokhtar pleads guilty to polygamy without consent|publisher=The Star|date=20 April 2010|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to one month imprisonment, but was ultimately released on bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/bung-les-malaysia-mp-bung-moktar-radins-top-10-gaffes|title="Bung-les": Malaysia MP Bung Moktar Radin's top 10 gaffes|publisher=The Straits Times|date=11 July 2014|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2010/05/19/bung-gets-a-months-jail-for-marrying-without-consent-granted-stay-of-execution-updated/|title=Bung gets a month's jail for marrying without consent; granted stay of execution (Updated)|last=Nurbaiti Hamdan|publisher=The Star|date=19 May 2010|accessdate=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Hitler remark===
He made international news for tweeting "Long Live [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]" after Germany's 7–1 win over Brazil in the semi-final of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/malaysian-mp-datuk-bung-moktar-radin-forced-to-apologise-for-posting-tweet-using-hitler-after-germany-won-world-cup-match/news-story/2bbcdc14f116e4038c4fb9899cec979f|title=Malaysian MP Datuk Bung Moktar Radin forced to apologise for posting tweet using ‘Hitler’ after Germany won World Cup match|author=Shoba Rao|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swearing in the parliament chamber===
On 7 August 2018, Bung Moktar Radin caused a stir with [[Willie Mongin]] (MP for {{pseat|Puncak Borneo}}) in the Dewan Rakyat as the latter alleged that the Bung Moktar Radin had visited a [[casino]], and he pointed his finger at Willie and accused him of being rude, demanding the statement be retracted.

{{quote|“What is this? (You are) Rude and ill-mannered (kurang ajar). YB (Yang Berhormat Willie) does not deserve to sit here.

“What do you want? You want to fight with me? Anytime. [[F**k]] you,”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nst.com.my/news/politics/2018/08/398939/f-you-shouts-bung-moktar-parliament&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|You didnt go to school,you didnt go to school!YB you sit down,you didnt go to school.This is my time,you sit down！}}

After the incident, [[Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof|the Speaker of Dewan Rakyat]] warned the members to behave or they will receive punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Speaker to MPs: Oh, behave…or get booted out of the Dewan |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m88-Y1Q_qd0 |accessdate=9 August 2018 |agency=The Star TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Camera coverage''', in [[filmmaking]] and [[video production]], is the amount of [[footage]] shot and different [[camera angle]]s used to capture a scene.  When in the [[post-production]] process, the more camera coverage means that there is more footage for the [[film editor]] to work with in assembling the [[Final cut (film editing)|final cut]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9422">In [[biology]], a '''colony''' is composed of two or more [[conspecific]] individuals living in close association with, or connected to, one another. This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey.&lt;ref name=Jackson1977&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/283203|title= Competition on Marine Hard Substrata: The Adaptive Significance of Solitary and Colonial Strategies|year=1977|last1=Jackson|first1=J.B.C.|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=111|issue=980|pages=743–767}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a cluster of identical cells (clones) on the surface of (or within) a solid medium, usually derived from a single parent cell, as in bacterial colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Colony|title=Colony – Biology-Online Dictionary|website=www.biology-online.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, a [[solitary animal|solitary organism]] is one in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce.

Colonies, in the context of development, may be composed of two or more unitary (or solitary) organisms or be [[modular]] organisms. '''Unitary organisms''' have determinate development (set life stages) from [[zygote]] to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals (colonies) are visually distinct. '''Modular organisms''' have indeterminate growth forms (life stages not set) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules (or individuals), and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | display-authors=1 | first1=Michael | last1=Begon | first2=Robert W. | last2=Howarth | first3=Colin R. | last3=Townsend | title=Essentials of Ecology | edition=4th | publisher=Wiley | year=2014 | isbn=0-470-90913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, modules may have specific functions within the colony.

Some organisms are primarily independent and form [[facultative]] colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive ([[obligate]]). For example, some [[carpenter bee]]s will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses&lt;ref name=DunnRichards2003&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/beheco/14.3.417|title= When to bee social: interactions among environmental constraints, incentives, guarding, and relatedness in a facultatively social carpenter bee|year=2003|last1=Dunn|first1=T.|last2=Richards|first2=M.H.|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=14|issue=3|pages=417–424}}&lt;/ref&gt; (facultative colony), while [[coral]]s are animals that are physically connected by living tissue (the [[coenosarc]]) that contains a shared [[gastrovascular cavity]].

== Colony types ==

=== Social colonies ===
[[File:Colony Northern Gannet Morus bassanus.jpg|thumb|A breeding colony of [[Northern gannet]]s on the [[Heligoland]] archipelago in the [[North Sea]].]]

[[Unicellular]] and [[multicellular]] unitary organisms may aggregate to form colonies. For example,
* [[Protist]]s such as [[slime mold]]s are many unicellular organisms that aggregate to form colonies when food resources are hard to come by, as together they are more reactive to chemical cues released by preferred prey.
* [[Eusociality|Eusocial]] insects like [[ant]]s and [[honey bee]]s are multicellular animals that live in colonies with a highly organized social structure. Colonies of some social insects may be deemed [[superorganism]]s.
*  [[Animal]]s, such as humans and [[rodent]]s, form breeding or [[bird colony|nesting colonies]], potentially for more successful mating and to better protect offspring.
** The [[Bracken Cave]] is the summer home to a colony of around 20 million [[Mexican free-tailed bat]]s making it the largest known concentration of mammals.&lt;ref name=natgeo&gt;{{cite journal | title = Quietly Conserving Nature | last = Grove | first = Noel | journal = [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] | date = December 1988 | volume = 174 | issue = 6 | page = 822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modular organisms ===
Modular organisms are those in which a genet (or genetic individual formed from a [[sexual reproduction|sexually-produced]] [[zygote]]) asexually reproduces to form genetically identical clones called [[ramet]]s.&lt;ref name=Winston2010&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1093/icb/icq146|title= Life in the Colonies: Learning the Alien Ways of Colonial Organisms|year=2010|last1=Winston|first1=J.|journal=Integrative and Comparative Biology|volume=50|issue=6|pages=919–933|pmid=21714171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[clonal colony]]''' is when the ramets of a genet live in close proximity or are physically connected. Ramets may have all of the functions needed to survive on their own or be interdependent on other ramets. For example, some [[sea anemone]]s go through the process of pedal laceration in which a genetically identical individual is asexually produced from tissue broken off from the anemone's pedal disc. In plants, clonal colonies are created through the propagation of genetically identical trees by [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s.

'''Colonial organisms''' are [[clonal colonies]] composed of many physically connected, interdependent individuals. Colonial organisms can be unicellular, as in the alga ''[[Volvox]]'' (a [[Coenobium (morphology)|coenobium]]), or [[Multicellular organism|multicellular]], as in the [[phylum]] [[Bryozoa]]. The former type may have been the first step toward multicellular [[organism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | display-authors=1 | first1=Bruce | last1=Alberts | first2=Dennis | last2=Bray | first3=Julian | last3=Lewis | first4=Martin | last4=Raff | first5=Keith | last5=Roberts | first6=James D. | last6=Watson | title=Molecular Biology of the Cell | edition=3rd | location=New York | publisher=Garland Science | year=1994 | isbn=0-8153-1620-8 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK28332/ | accessdate=2014-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals within a multicellular colonial organism may be called [[ramet]]s, [[Modularity (biology)|modules]], or [[zooid]]s. Structural and functional variation ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]), when present, designates ramet responsibilities such as feeding, reproduction, and defense. To that end, being physically connected allows the colonial organism to distribute nutrients and energy obtained by feeding zooids throughout the colony. An example of colonial organisms that is well known are hydrozoans, like Portuguese man o' wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.org/accounts/Hydrozoa/|title=Hydrozoa|website=Animal Diversity Web|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbial colonies ===
A '''microbial colony'''  is defined as a visible cluster of [[microorganism]]s growing on the surface of or within a solid medium, presumably cultured from a single cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  | isbn = 0-321-58420-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the colony is [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], with all organisms in it descending from a single ancestor (assuming no [[contamination]]), they are genetically identical, except for any [[mutation]]s (which occur at low frequencies). Obtaining such genetically identical organisms (or pure [[Strain (biology)|strains]]) can be useful; this is done by spreading organisms on a culture plate and starting a new stock from a single resulting colony.

A '''[[biofilm]]''' is a colony of [[microorganism]]s often comprising several species, with properties and capabilities greater than the aggregate of capabilities of the individual organisms.

== Life history ==

Individuals in social colonies and modular organisms receive benefit to such a lifestyle. For example, it may be easier to seek out food, defend a nesting site, or increase competitive ability against other species. Modular organisms' ability to reproduce asexually in addition to sexually allows them unique benefits that social colonies do not have.&lt;ref name="Winston2010" /&gt;

The energy required for sexual reproduction varies based on the frequency and length of reproductive activity, number and size of offspring, and parental care.&lt;ref name=KunzOrrell&gt;{{cite journal|title= Energy Costs of Reproduction|year=2004|last1=Kunz|first1=T.H.|last2=Orrell|first2=K.S.|journal=Encyclopedia of Energy|volume=5|pages=423–442}}&lt;/ref&gt; While solitary individuals bear all of those energy costs, individuals in some social colonies share a portion of those costs.

Modular organisms save energy by using asexual reproduction during their life. Energy reserved in this way allows them to put more energy towards colony growth, regenerating lost modules (due to predation or other cause of death), or response to environmental conditions.

A '''counter-offensive''' is the term used by the [[military]] to describe large-scale, usually [[strategic offensive]] operations by forces that had successfully halted the enemy's [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], while occupying [[Strategic defence|defensive]] positions. 

The counter-offensive is executed after exhausting the enemy's front line troops and after the enemy reserves had been committed to combat and proven incapable of breaching defences, but ''before'' the enemy has had the opportunity to assume new defensive positions. Sometimes the counter-offensive can be of a more limited operational maneuver nature, with more limited objectives rather than those seeking attainment of a [[Strategic goal (military)|strategic goal]]. A counter-offensive as considered by [[Clausewitz]] to be the most efficient means of forcing the attacker to abandon offensive plans.&lt;ref&gt;p.540, Briggs&lt;/ref&gt;

Counter-offensives can be executed not only on land, but also by the naval forces and air forces. Strategic counter-offensives have been recorded by military historians in many wars throughout [[military history]]. Although not always known as such, because they are usually described by historians in conjunction with the defensive phase, such as the [[Battle of Moscow]].

A [[counterattack]] is the [[military tactics|tactical]] and sometimes smaller operational equivalent of the counter-offensive.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2965">The '''Declaration of Finglas''' was issued on 17 July 1690 by [[William III of Ireland]] at [[Finglas]] in [[County Dublin]], shortly after his [[Williamite]] army's decisive victory at the [[Battle of the Boyne]] during the [[War of the Two Kings]].

The Declaration was issued by William from Finglas, where his army had camped following the battle against the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[Irish Army (Kingdom of Ireland)|Irish Army]]. It was targeted at the followers of William's uncle and rival [[James II of Ireland|James II]]. There was a religious division between the two sides with William backed by Protestants and James mainly supported by Catholics. William was looking for a quick end to the fighting in Ireland, as he was the leader of the [[Grand Alliance (League of Augsburg)|Grand Alliance]] against [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] and his presence was urgently needed elsewhere in Europe. The Declaration was drafted by [[Sir Richard Cox,  1st Baronet]], the future [[Lord Chancellor of Ireland]]. William approved the final draft and said he hardly needed to change a word of it.

While offering a full protection (effectively a [[pardon]]) to those who surrendered by 1 August (this was later extended to 25 August), the Declaration significantly excepted those who were "the desperate leaders of the present rebellion". This was an attempt to split the rank-and-file Jacobites away from their leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Childs p.229&lt;/ref&gt; This repeated a tactic employed by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during his [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland|Irish Campaign]] forty years earlier.

Despite the Williamites capturing the Irish capital of [[Dublin]], the uncompromising terms set out at Finglas encouraged many leaders to fight on, and this was reinforced by the successful [[Siege of Limerick (1690)|defence of Limerick]] the same summer. Much of the ordinary population remained loyal to the landowners and to King James while William increasingly had to concentrate his forces in Southern England and Flanders to confront the French, leading to the war dragging on for another year in Ireland.

The [[Treaty of Limerick]] in 1691 granted more generous terms to the defeated Jacobites than had been offered at Finglas, allowing them to retain their pre-war estates. This met with many objections from the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] who felt the terms offered had been too generous. Nonetheless, a sizeable number of the Jacobite leaders went into exile on the continent in the [[Flight of the Wild Geese]], continuing to swear loyalty to James II and his successors.

'''Faroese grammar''' is related and very similar to that of [[Icelandic grammar|Icelandic]]. [[Faroese language|Faroese]] is an [[inflected language]] with three [[grammatical gender]]s and four [[case (grammar)|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[genitive case|genitive]].

==Noun inflection==
Below is a representation of three [[grammatical gender]]s, two numbers and four cases in the nominal [[inflection]].  This is just an overview to give a general idea of how the grammar works. Faroese actually has even more [[declension]]s. In modern Faroese the genitive has a very limited use (and possession is mostly expressed with various prepositional phrases instead). For most native speakers, the Genitive is a learned and somewhat stilted form as opposed to the other cases which are learned naturally in regular colloquial situations.

Read:
*''hvør, hvat?'' [[interrogative pronoun]] "who, what?"
*''ein'' [[indefinite article]] "a"
*''stórur'' [[adjective]] "big"
*''bátur'' [[noun]] "boat"
*ein stórur bátur - a big boat (''m.'')
*ein vøkur genta - a beautiful girl (''f.'')
*eitt gott barn - a good child (''n.'')

In the plural you will see that even the [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]] ''tvey'' (2) is inflected.

|}

If the noun is definite, the adjective inflects ''weak'', and the noun gets a suffix article as in any Scandinavian language (although Icelandic does not generally need a pre-posed definite article in this construction).

The interrogative pronoun is the same as above. In the plural, the plural form of the definite article is used.

*tey eru fólk úr Evropa - they are people from Europe (''both sexes'')

==Verbs==

===Weak Inflection===
There are 4 classes of weak inflection of verbs (with some underclasses). E.g.:
#stem-final '''-a''', 2-3.pers.sg. '''-r''' - kall'''a!''' ([[Imperative mood|imperative]]), tú/hann kalla-r (you/he call(s))
#2-3.pers.sg. '''-ur''' - tú/hann sel'''ur''' (you/he sell(s))
#2-3.pers.sg. '''-ir''' - tú/hann døm'''ir''' (you/he judge(s))
#2. pers.sg. '''-rt''' - tú rø'''rt''' (you row). In certain surroundings, skerping occurs: ''eg rógvi'' {{IPA|[eː ɹɛɡvɪ]}}, I row; vs. ''eg róði'' {{IPA|[eː ɹɔuwɪ]}}, I rowed.

[[File:CDC Graphic Artists at Work.jpg|right|thumb|Graphic artists at work during the 1960s]]
A category of [[fine art]], '''graphic art''' covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-art Graphic art]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Britannica.com. Retrieved 2016-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially [[drawing]] and the various forms of [[engraving]];&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;"Graphic art." ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. 3rd ed.  Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to [[printmaking]] processes,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; such as [[line engraving]],  [[aquatint]], [[drypoint]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[monotyping|monotype]], [[lithography]], and [[screen printing]] (silk-screen, serigraphy).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph (1992). "Graphic arts, or graphics." ''The HarperCollins Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques''. 2nd ed. Revised and edited by Steven Sheehan. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphic art further includes [[calligraphy]], [[photography]], [[painting]], [[typography]], [[computer graphics]], and [[bindery]]. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

==History==
Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as [[hieroglyphics]]. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.&lt;ref name="Meggs"&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip B.|last=Meggs|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design |title=Graphic design|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, scribes [[scriptorium|manually copied]] each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to [[illuminated manuscript|insert drawings and decorations]]. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"&gt;McGuire-Lyle, Erin.  ''Careers in the Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics'' (Career Resource Library). June 2000. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the [[printing press]] in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.

Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on [[typeface]].

Due to the development of larger fonts during the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[posters]] became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.

The invention and popularity of [[film]] and [[television]] changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.

The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal [[computer]] was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.&lt;ref name="Meggs"/&gt;

The scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.

== Graphic design software ==
{{off topic|date=October 2013}}
[[File:Vacation Rentals In Hawaii Image.jpg|thumb|Example of graphic arts created with the free tool, Paint.net.]]
Graphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.

Graphic art software includes applications such as:
*[[Adobe Dreamweaver]] – a tool that facilitates the creation of webpages and dynamic internet content
*[[Adobe Illustrator]] – an application that allows artists to manipulate vector graphics
*[[Adobe InDesign]] – desktop publishing software used for layout and design manipulation
*[[Adobe Photoshop]] – a bitmap graphics software including powerful graphics editing tools that provide a large variety of editing functionality
*[[CorelDRAW]] – similar to Adobe Illustrator, it is another vector graphic manipulation tool
*[[PhotoImpact]] – a digital photograph editor
*[[QuarkXPress]] – similar to Adobe InDesign, it is another computer publishing software tool

===Free software===
*[[Paint.net]] – photograph editing capabilities with lots of plugins to expand use
*[[GIMP]] – similar to paint.net and Photoshop
*[[Inkscape]] – similar to Illustrator

Beside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt;

== Careers ==
{{howto|date=October 2013}}
One of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the [[World Wide Web]], the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and [[logos]] to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt; The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.

'''Guillaume Faye''' ({{IPA-fr|faj|lang}}; born 7 November 1949 in [[Angoulême]]) is a French journalist and writer.

==Career&lt;!--'Archeofuturism' redirects here--&gt;==
With a PhD from [[Science-Po]], Guillaume Faye was one of the major theorists of the French New Right (''[[Nouvelle Droite]]'') in the 1970–80s.  A former member of [[Alain de Benoist]]'s New Right organisation [[GRECE]], he took part in the splitting of the organization in 1986 alongside Yann-Ber Tillenon, [[:fr:Tristan Mordrelle|Tristan Mordrelle]], and [[:fr:Goulven Pennaod|Goulven Pennaod]]. At that time he was close to nationalist neo-Pagans. Simultaneously, he made his way up as a journalist, namely in ''[[Le Figaro|Figaro Magazine]]'', [[Paris-Match]], [[VSD (French magazine)|VSD]], etc.  Guillaume Faye also led a journal called ''J'ai Tout Compris!'' (I Understood Everything!) which closed down soon after.

In 1987, Guillaume Faye withdrew from politics. In the year 1990 he took part in [[Skyrock (radio)|Skyrock]] radio station as 'Skyman'. He also appeared in ''[[Telematin]]'' episodes on the [[France 2]] TV channel from 1991 to 1993. In 1998, he finally returned to politics after publishing some essays on various subjects such as culture and religion. Several of these essays were collected into his major work, ''Archeofuturism,'' which was published in English translation in 2010. This book lays out his fundamental ideas, including his opposition to immigration, his dismissal of contemporary European politics, his call for a pan-European government, and his concept of '''archeofuturism''', which involves combining [[Traditionalist School|traditionalist]] spirituality and concepts of sovereignty with the latest advances in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Michael O'Meara, [http://www.counter-currents.com/2010/09/foreword-to-archeofuturism/ "Foreword to Guillaume Faye's ''Archeofuturism''"], Counter-Currents Publishing, 10 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Faye relaunched ''J'ai Tout Compris!'' as a monthly edition where he expresses his ideas: Faye predicts an abolition of European societies due to massive immigration, and a total war between the West and the Islamic world, endorsing the "[[clash of civilization]]" theory.

He takes part in the ''[[Rivarol (magazine)|Rivarol]]'' journal and regularly collaborates with Pierre Vial's ''[[:fr:Terre et Peuple|Terre et Peuple]]'' neo-Pagan group. He also participates in conferences abroad, such as with the US nationalist group [[American Renaissance (magazine)|American Renaissance]] on 3 March 2006.

Faye has been criticized for his "extremism" by [[Alain de Benoist]] in a March 2000 interview published in the Italian review ''Area'', close to the ''[[Alleanza Nazionale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Jean-Yves Camus|Jean-Yves Camus]], ''[http://tempspresents.wordpress.com/2008/10/01/la-nouvelle-droite-bilan-provisoire-d%E2%80%99une-ecole-de-pensee/ La Nouvelle droite : bilan provisoire d’une école de pensée]'', ''[[La Pensée]]'', March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, he published ''La Nouvelle question juive'' (''The New Jewish question'') in which he strongly criticized [[Holocaust denial|Holocaust deniers]] and many [[Third Position]]ists and anti-Zionists (such as [[Alain Soral]] or [[Christian Bouchet]]) whom he accuses of sympathy for [[Islamism]]. As a response, he was accused of being a "national-Zionist".

Several of Faye's books have been translated into English and published by [[Arktos Media|Arktos]]. These include ''Archeofuturism – European visions of the post-catastrophic age'' (2010), ''Why we Fight – manifesto of the European resistance'' (2011) and ''Convergence of Catastrophes'' (2012).

A '''health assessment''' is a plan of [[medical care|care]] that identifies the specific needs of a person and how those needs will be addressed by the [[healthcare system]] or [[skilled nursing facility]]. Health assessment is the evaluation of the health status by performing a [[physical exam]] after taking a [[health history]]. It is done to detect diseases early in people that may look and feel well.

Evidence does not support routine health assessments in otherwise healthy people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Si|first=S|author2=Moss, JR |author3=Sullivan, TR |author4=Newton, SS |author5= Stocks, NP |title=Effectiveness of general practice-based health checks: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=The British journal of general practice : the journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners|date=Jan 2014|volume=64|issue=618|pages=e47-53|pmid=24567582 |doi=10.3399/bjgp14x676456|pmc=3876170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health assessment is the evaluation of the health status of an individual along the health continuum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wellpeople.com/images/Illness_WellnessContinuum.jpg Illness -  Wellness Continuum image]&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the assessment is to establish where on the health continuum the individual is because this guides how to approach and treat the individual. The health continuum approaches range from [[preventative]], to [[medical treatment|treatment]], to [[palliative care]] in relation to the individual's status on the health continuum. It is not the treatment or [[treatment plan]]. The plan related to findings is a care plan which is preceded by the specialty such as medical, [[physical therapy]], [[nursing]], etc.

==History==
''Health assessment'' has been separated by authors from physical assessment to include the focus on health occurring on a continuum as a fundamental teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Zator Estes, M. (2006). Health assessment and physical examination. Independence, KY: Delmar Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[healthcare industry]] it is understood health occurs on a continuum, so the term used is ''assessment'' but may be preference by the speciality's focus such as nursing, physical therapy, etc. In healthcare, the assessment's focus is biopsychosocial but the intensity of focus may vary by the type of healthcare practitioner. For example, in the emergency room the focus is chief complaint and how to help that person related to the perceived problem. If the problem is a heart attack then the intensity of focus is on the biological/physical problem initially.

[[File:1963-BHHk.jpg|thumb|Reading room in the 1960s]]
The '''Hector Hodler Library''' is one of the largest [[Esperanto library|Esperanto libraries]], with approximately 30,000 books, with periodicals, manuscripts, photos, music, and other collections.  It occupies three rooms in the central office of the [[Universal Esperanto Association]] (UEA) in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]]. 

[[File:2006-bhh.JPG|thumb|Library in 2006]]
The library is originated in Switzerland, when the Swiss Esperanto Society opened a library in 1908.  In 1912, the library came to the possession of [[Hector Hodler]], the founder of UEA.  After his death, it was under UEA in Switzerland.  After World War II, in 1947, the library was renamed the Hector Hodler Library in his honour.  Along with the translocation of the UEA headquarters to Rotterdam, the library was settled there in 1960.

Other major collections of Esperanto books are: International Esperanto Museum, [[Montagu C. Butler Library]], [[Centre de documentation et d'étude sur la langue internationale]], and the German Esperanto Library.

'''“Hō-Ren-Sō”''' (報・連・相) is a business [[mantra]] or [[mnemonic]] [[acronym]] in Japanese business culture. It is an “abbreviation of “''Hōkoku''” (報告, to report), “''Renraku''" (連絡, to inform) and “''Sōdan''” (相談, to consult), and is more memorable as a [[homonym]] of ''hōrensō'', the Japanese word for "[[spinach]]". It is utilized as a basic business rule in Japan to conduct smooth business communication. The origin of “'''Ho-Ren-So'''” comes from Tomiji Yamazaki who was the ex-president of Yamatana Security firm. In 1982 he started using the term for effective business communication in his firm and it has been widely spread and used throughout Japan through his book, “Strengthen your company with '''Ho-Ren-So'''”.

==Description==
“''Hokoku''” is to report on a process or result of business from a subordinate to a superior.&lt;ref name=Forest&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.culturalcandor.com/blogs/japanese-versus-western-leadership/| title=JAPANESE CULTURE AND LEADERSHIP STYLE| accessdate=2 May 2017| publisher=Cultural Candor Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, subordinates don't have much authority to make business decision. Usually the decisions are made by an organization as a whole. Therefore, a subordinate must report everything to superior immediately and exactly. It is especially important to report a mistake or a problem immediately because his/her superior has the responsibility for it.

“''Renraku''” is to inform facts. One must inform the facts and decision to the relevant parties. One should not include one's opinion and guesses. If "''Renraku''" is not done or not completed, then you cannot control your team. And then, "''Renraku''" communicated to the people who need it. Finally, "''Renraku''" done quickly. Its content might need to prepare for the next action.

“''Sodan''” is to consult or discuss. For example, a superior give a subordinate an advice, and an employee talks over with superior about some unnecessary consultation in Japanese business. Because a superior rarely speaks to a subordinate in the Japanese company, but, they want to be asked for their advice. They want others to think that "you can always count on me." So, they feel better if they receive request for consultation from their subordinate.

==Pros and Cons==

There are many benefits to incorporating the "'''Ho-Ren-So'''" philosophy. First, if a issues within tasks are reported, it can be resolved quickly because a manager controls it and decides how to resolve it. Next, if information is communicated with team members and it is known all members of a team, they can take ownership of the schedule and tasks. Finally, if information is consulted from a subordinate, a decrease of quality will be prevented and likely won't occur again.

On the other hand, there are some Cons in "'''Ho-Ren-So'''". First, there is a cost of management. It is a very time consuming process, leaving employees with little time to complete their various work assignments. Moreover, and since a subordinate must always wait instructions from his/her supervisor, this prevents employees from applying problem-solving skills on their own without the constant need for managerial input.

The '''International Standard Wine Number''' or '''ISWN''', similar to the [[ISBN]] for books, was a coding scheme intended to give a [[unique identifier]] for each [[wine]] worldwide. The ISWN system had a consistent unique code for each wine producer (ISWN-P), each wine brand or product (ISWN-W), each [[vintage]] variant of a wine product (ISWN-V), and the bottle variants (ISWN-B). The ISWN was allocated by the ISWN Organization on the basis of a global reference database of wine producers and wines worldwide. The database was improved through wine producers updating their own data with the ISWN Manager module. The ISWN Organization was a [[Non-profit organization]] sponsored by the wine industry.

== Biography ==
Joan Sales i Vallès was born in November 19, 1912,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.escriptors.cat/autors/salesj/pagina.php?id_sec=2194 |title= Joan Sales i Vallès |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= April 8, 2015|website=escriptors.cat |publisher= [[Associació d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana|AELC]] |access-date= April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Eixample district of Barcelona, in a family originally from [[Vallclara]], in [[Conca de Barberà]]. His familiar surroundings progresses, at a political level, from traditionalism to the [[Catalan nationalism]] closer to [[Lliga Regionalista]]. When his father's business goes to ruin, the family is determined to remain at Vallclara. But Sales, who by the time has became bachelor in Lleida, move to Barcelona despite he is only seventeen.

Joan Sales acted very young in opposition to the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]].He was also one of the first Catalan language teachers of the official census of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] formed by [[Pompeu Fabra]].&lt;ref name="gencat"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Departament-de-la-Presidencia/menuitem.7b6b6ed90c92ef316d740d63b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=6fb8977e597e5310VgnVCM2000009b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=6fb8977e597e5310VgnVCM2000009b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default|title= Joan Sales i Vallès|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher= [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] |access-date= August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated with a degree in law at the University of Barcelona in 1932. He affiliated with [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]], which will leave soon. At the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]], he graduated at the School of War and was appointed official.&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt; He felt sorrow about the anarchy in the rear and in his desire to help to maintain the power of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican Government]] of [[Generalitat of Catalonia|Generalitat]]&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt; he went to the fronts of Madrid and [[Aragon Front|Aragon]]. In 1933, he married [[Núria Folch i Pi|Maria Núria Folch]], Catalan publisher, with whom he had a daughter the same year: Núria Sales Folch.

He met the poet [[Màrius Torres]], who was already ill of [[tuberculosis]]with whom will share an intense friendship. They will keep an effusive correspondence until the death of Màrius, in 1942. From Màrius Torres he receives a deeply literary influence.

In 1939, he went into exile in France and then, in 1940, in the Dominican Republic, and from there, to Mexico in 1942. He worked there as linotypist. In exile, he drove a deeply ideological journal, ''[[Quaderns de l'Exili]]'' (1943–1947). His text ''Els Òrsides''is a criticism to the intellectuals that do not assume the critical challenges of the country. From there, he edited with notes and studies, ''[[L'Atlàntida]]'', ''[[Canigó (poem)|Canigó]]'', ''[[La nacionalitat catalana]]'' and the first edition of ''Poesies'' from [[Màrius Torres]] (1947).&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt;

Once returned to Catalonia in 1948, he focused on publishing tasks, discovering essential authors to the [[Modern Age|modern]] [[Catalan literature]] ([[Màrius Torres]], [[Llorenç Villalonga]] and [[Mercè Rodoreda]]).&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt;

In 1955, he founded, with [[Xavier Benguerel i Llobet|Xavier Benguerel]] and [[Joan Oliver i Sallarès|Joan Oliver]], [[El Club dels Novel·listes]], with which they wanted to expand the readership Catalan, developing a narrative and a more popular level language more accessible.&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt;

Since its imprint, el Club Editor, he will offer to the public his work ''[[Uncertain glory (book)|Uncertain glory]]'' ("Incerta glòria"), that do not appeared in definitive edition until 1971 and his epistolary war and exile ''Letters to Màrius Torres'' (1976). Other works include the book of poems ''Viatge d'un moribund'' (1952), his translations from [[Nikos Kazantzakis|Kazantzakis]] and [[Dostoyevski]] or the outline of a comic opera, music by [[Joan Altisent i Ceardi|Joan Altisent]], ''En Tirant lo Blanc a Grècia''.&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt;

Sales was documentary and commentator of ''Historia de España'' and also of ''Història dels Catalans'' form [[Ferran Soldevila i Zubiburu|Ferran Soldevila]], and he wrote numerous works prologues for books from [[Joan Coromines]], [[Mercè Rodoreda]] and [[Llorenç Villalonga]]. He directed the [[Diputació de Barcelona]] Office of Catalan until he retired (1982). Posthumously, ''Contes d'ahir i d'avui'' (1987) and his correspondence with Mercè Rodoreda (2008) were published.&lt;ref name="gencat"/&gt;

He died in Barcelona on November 12, 1983 and was buried in [[Siurana (Tarragona)|Siurana]] ([[Cornudella de Montsant]], [[Priorat]]). Núria, his wife, who died in 2010, was buried beside him.

'''Johann Heinrich Baumann''' ({{lang-lv|Johans Heinrihs Baumanis}}; 9 February 1753 – 29 July 1832) was a [[Baltic German]] artist who mainly lived and worked in what is today [[Latvia]].

==Early life and education==
Johann Heinrich Baumann was born in [[Jelgava]] ({{lang-de|Mitau}}) into a German-speaking family. He was the son of the pastor and [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|general superintendent of Mitau]], Joachim Baumann.

==University==
Baumann went to [[University of Erfurt]] to study theology in 1773–1776. However, in Erfurt he took up painting, under the influence of {{ill|Jacob Samuel Beck|de|Jakob Samuel Beck}} (1715–1778), a notable local painter specialising in animal portraits in the then-prevailing [[Baroque]] style. After his studies, Baumann returned to his Baltic homeland [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]] but would henceforth pursue a career as an artist and not as a priest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Neumann|first= Wilhelm|authorlink= |title= Lexikon Baltischer Künstler|url= https://archive.org/stream/lexikonbaltisch00drgoog#page/n18/mode/2up|accessdate= 14 April 2013|year= 1908|publisher= Jonck &amp; Poliewsky|language=German|location= Riga |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hunter&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.studija.lv/en/?parent=842|title= The Hunter with A Paintbrush|last1= Lamberga|first1= Dace|year= 2004 |publisher= Studija Visual Arts Magazine|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travels==
Being a keen hunter, Baumann travelled as far as present-day [[Lithuania]], [[Russia]] and [[Belarus]] on hunting expeditions.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; He also wrote anecdotal, whimsical short stories about his hunting adventures, for which he has been called the "[[Baron Munchausen|Munchausen]] of [[Courland]]".&lt;ref name=artoflativa/&gt; His outdoors interests also came to dominate his art completely, which is an unusual blend of skillfulness and professionalism mixed with naivety and slovenliness. Almost all his known paintings depict animals, hunting scenes or related subjects.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt; His style is perhaps best characterised as a provincial form of [[Baroque]], inspired to some extent by similar motives in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], executed in a highly personal way. Although he never became recognised as a major artist in [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]], he was still acknowledged by a special mention of the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] in 1786. He is reputed to have painted over 1700 paintings, however only 43 surviving paintings are safely attributed to him today.&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;&lt;ref name=artoflativa&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artoflatvia.lv/darbi/19|title= Johans Heinrihs Baumanis|last1= Belēvičs|first1= Guntis|publisher= Latvian Art Classics|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playwriting==
Baumann was also one of the first authors in present-day [[Latvia]] to write plays for the stage in [[Latvian language|Latvian]].&lt;ref name=hunter/&gt;

'''Juan Diez de Betanzos''' wrote one of the most important sources on the conquest of the [[Incan civilization]], [[Narrative of the Incas]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Betanzos, ''Narrative of the Incas,'' ed. Dana Buchanan, tr. Roland Hamilton, University of Texas Press (1996)  {{ISBN|0-292-75559-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He based this account of the Incas on the testimony of his wife, who had been previously married to Incan King [[Atahualpa]] as well as conducting interviews of Incans who had taken part in the Battle of Cajamarca or been in Atahualpa's camp.

The ''Narrative of the Incas'' is rare in coming from the Indian perspective. In the absence of written Incan sources, it is also relatively unique in providing us with an insight into Incan  civilization before the conquest with early expansion, the development of the kingdom of [[Cusco Region|Cuzco]] by [[Túpac Inca Yupanqui|Yupanqui]] and the great imperial policies of [[Huayna Capac]]. It also provides an insight into the civil war between [[Huáscar]] and Atahualpa that ravaged the Incan civilization immediately prior to the arrival of [[Francisco Pizarro]]. However, coming from Atahualpa's wife's point of view, the source is biased against Huáscar.

'''Krasnohrad''' or '''Krasnograd'''&lt;ref&gt;Also known as ''Krasnograd'' fortress (Красноград) (1731-1784), ''Konstantinograd'' fortress (Константиноград) (1784-1922), city of Konstantinograd (1922-1943).&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-uk|Красноград}}) is a city in [[Kharkiv Oblast]] ([[oblast|province]]) of [[Ukraine]]. In 1784-1922 it was known as '''Kostyantynohrad''' or '''Konstantingrad'''. It serves as the administrative center of [[Krasnohrad Raion]]. Population: {{Ua-pop-est2017|20,914}}

The city of Krasnohrad was founded as a fortress of Bilevsk in 1731-1733, as part of the [[Ukrainian line]] defence fortifications, which ran from the [[Dnieper]] to the [[Donets]]. The fortress was named after the Russian military garrison that was formed in a town of [[Belyov]] (near [[Tula, Russia|Tula]]). In 1784 the fortress was renamed Kostyantynohrad, and in 1797 it received city status. In 1922 it was renamed Krasnohrad.

It is located on the [[Berestova River]] {{convert|101|km|mi}} to the south of the city of Kharkiv.

== History ==
The Latvian Wikipedia was created alongside the [[Serbian Wikipedia|Serbian]], [[Kannada Wikipedia|Kannada]], [[Walloon Wikipedia|Walloon]], [[Wolof Wikipedia|Wolof]], and Xhosa Wikipedias.&lt;ref name=GrowthSummary/&gt; The oldest article is "Psihologija", which was published on 6 June 2003 and redirected to "Psiholoģija" (psychology) on 7 December 2004.&lt;ref name=EarliestRev&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Psihologija&amp;action=history|title=Raksta "Psiholoģija" vēsture|publisher=Vikipēdija|accessdate=9 May 2014|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main page was added four months after the first article, on 6 October 2003.&lt;ref name=EarliestRevMain&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sākumlapa&amp;action=history|title=Raksta "Sākumlapa" vēsture|publisher=Vikipēdija|accessdate=9 May 2014|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The edition's initial growth was slow and some articles about important aspects of Latvian culture were missing at first.&lt;ref name="nra.lv"/&gt; The article about [[Jāņi]], for instance, was not written until March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Links&amp;nbsp;— Reference|url=http://latviansonline.com/links/topic/C649/|publisher=Latvians Online|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513072308/http://latviansonline.com/links/topic/C649/|archivedate=13 May 2014|accessdate=12 May 2014|quote=Incidentally, seeing as Jāņi is fast approaching, we searched Vikipēdija but came up with nothing. The English version, though, does have quite a comprehensive section on the subject of "Midsummer," covering the whole region of Northern Europe and the way it celebrates this time of the year.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latvian Wikipedia's growth rate has been very stable since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Zachte|first=Erik|title=Wikipedia Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Europe&amp;nbsp;— Contributors|url=http://stats.wikimedia.org/EN_Europe/PlotsPngArticlesTotal.htm#p7|publisher=stats.wikimedia.org|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 September 2013, the [[VisualEditor]] was made available to logged-in users, and by 7 October 2013, it was available to all users on the Latvian Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VisualEditor|url=http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/VisualEditor#Timeline|work=MediaWiki|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latvian Wikipedia turned 10 years old on 6 June 2013. A commemorative logo was uploaded for the occasion, and small parties among the community's "Wikiholics" ensued, as it is customary whenever a new milestone is reached.&lt;ref name=Diena10&gt;{{cite web|last=Elīna|first=Zalāne|title=Latviešu Vikipēdija svin 10 gadu jubileju|url=http://www.diena.lv/dienas-zurnali/sestdiena/latviesu-vikipedija-svin-10-gadu-jubileju-14011382|publisher=Diena|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=Latvian|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edition surpassed 50,000 articles on 17 August 2013.&lt;ref name=Aktualitates/&gt;

{{As of|2014|7}}, according to the [[:meta:List of Wikipedias by sample of articles|list of Wikipedias by sample of articles]] at Meta-Wiki, which is based on the [[:meta:List of articles every Wikipedia should have|list of articles every Wikipedia should have]], the Latvian Wikipedia ranks 52nd out of 287 editions, with a score of 20.83/100. It lacks almost no article from the list of vital articles, but contains generally short articles.

=== Name and logo ===
On 22 September 2004, the first Latvian "Wikipēdija" logo was uploaded, and on 1 June 2005, the name was changed to "Vikipēdija".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aizvien par "Wikipēdija" / "Vikipēdija"|url=http://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikip%C4%93dija:Kopienas_port%C4%81ls/Arh%C4%ABvs1#Aizvien_par_.22Wikip.C4.93dija.22_.2F_.22Vikip.C4.93dija.22|publisher=Vikipēdija|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latvian media, the words "Wikipedia" and "Vikipēdija" are used interchangeably to refer to both Wikipedia in general and to the Latvian edition specifically, but "Vikipēdija" is more common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vikipēdijas krievu valodas versija pārtrauc darbu, protestējot pret interneta cenzēšanu|url=http://www.kasnotiek.com/2012/07/vikipedijas-krievu-valodas-versija.html|publisher=Kasnotiek.com|accessdate=13 May 2014|language=Latvian|date=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pirmā persona, kas iegūst savu "Wikipedia" lapu vēl pirms piedzimšanas|url=http://www.delfi.lv/sievietem/relationships/dzive/karalisko-dzemdibu-histerija-parnem-pasauli-top-4-izpausmes.d?id=43483107&amp;page=2|publisher=[[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI.lv]]|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[Zolitūde shopping centre roof collapse]] disaster of 21 November 2013, the Latvian Wikipedia, just as several other Latvian websites, changed its logo for three days to include black and the image of a candle.

=== Latvian Wikipedia Marathon ===
[[File:Vikimaratona plakāts Ģertrūdes ielā.jpg|thumb|right|Poster of Latvian Wikipedia Marathon in [[Riga]] ]]
{{main|Latvian Wikipedia Marathon}}
Latvian Wikipedia Marathon ({{lang-lv|Latvijas Vikipēdijas maratons}}) was a project that brought together the Latvian Wikipedia community with several private partners in joint effort with the aim of expanding the Latvian Wikipedia to activate the usability of the Latvian language in the learning process, cognition and research work.

== Policies ==
Since 31 October 2012, the Latvian Wikipedia displays a notice encouraging users to sign a petition on the Latvian social initiative platform [[ManaBalss.lv]] in an effort to change the Latvian copyright law, which permits taking pictures of architectural works and monuments, but only for non-commercial purposes. According to the petition, "such restrictions are not reasonable for buildings, monuments, sculptures and other three-dimensional works that cannot be fully reproduced in two dimensions".&lt;ref name="nra.lv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MediaWiki:Sitenotice|url=http://lv.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=MediaWiki:Sitenotice&amp;oldid=1824281|publisher=Vikipēdija|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the law changed, pictures of Latvian public buildings would become valid on Wikimedia Commons.

* As opposed to the English Wikipedia, it is not required to be logged-in to create a new article on the Latvian Wikipedia.
* Many users use personalized license templates on the images they upload locally to have them grouped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kategorija:Individuālās attēlu autortiesību veidnes|url=http://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategorija:Individuālās_attēlu_autortiesību_veidnes|publisher=Vikipēdija|accessdate=13 May 2014|language=Latvian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Unlike most major Wikipedias, the Latvian Wikipedia adopted [[Wikipedia:Gadget|gadgets]] very late, in May 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikip%C4%93dija:Kopienas_port%C4%81ls/Arh%C4%ABvs28#Da.C5.BEas_f.C4.AB.C4.8Das | title=Dažas fīčas | publisher=Vikipēdija | date=9 May 2014 | accessdate=21 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Images ===
The Latvian Wikipedia has an Exemption Doctrine Policy (''Godprātīga lietošana'') that allows local uploads of non-free, [[fair use]] images and audio/video files (with copyright restrictions). However, users are encouraged to release their work under a Creative Commons license and upload it on Wikimedia Commons instead, thus making it accessible throughout all editions of Wikipedia. This stance is similar to the English Wikipedia's, and in contrast to some other editions, which rely strictly on [[Wikimedia Commons]] for images, sound, and other media files, including i.a. the [[Spanish Wikipedia|Spanish]], [[Swedish Wikipedia|Swedish]], [[Polish Wikipedia|Polish]], [[Basque Wikipedia|Basque]], [[Czech Wikipedia|Czech]], [[Danish Wikipedia|Danish]], [[Wikipedia:Volapük Wikipedia|Volapük]] and [[Latin Wikipedia|Latin]] Wikipedias.&lt;ref name=wmeta/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Non-free content|url=http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Non-free_content|work=Meta-Wiki|publisher=Wikimedia Foundation|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Londona iet ar kājām|url=http://www.kasjauns.lv/lv/lielasbildes.html?bigimage_offset=5|publisher=Kasjauns.lv|accessdate=12 May 2014|language=Latvian|date=5 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States Armed Forces]], the term '''line officer''' or '''officer of the line''' refers to a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] or [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]], [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officer]] or [[Warrant officer (United States)|warrant officer]] who exercises general command authority and is eligible for operational command positions, as opposed to officers who normally exercise command authority only within a [[United States Navy staff corps|Navy Staff Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/US%20Navy%20Regulations/Chapter%2010%20-%20Precedence,%20Authority%20and%20Command.pdf |title=US Navy Regulations, Chapter 10, Paragraph 1001. |publisher=US Navy |date= |accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "line officer" is also used by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] and [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] to indicate that an officer is eligible for command of operational, viz., tactical or "combat" units. The term is not generally used by officers of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] – the roughly corresponding Army terms are [[Structure of the United States Army#Branches and functional areas|'''basic branch''' (e.g, Infantry) and '''special branch,''' (e.g., Medical Corps)]] qualified officers, although the concepts are not entirely synonymous, as some Army special branch officers (i.e., Judge Advocate General's Corps) are eligible to hold command outside their branch specialty.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apd.army.mil/jw2/xmldemo/r600_20/main.asp#ch2&lt;/ref&gt;

Officers who are not line officers are those whose primary duties are generally in non-combat specialties including (depending upon the service) [[Judge Advocate General's Corps (United States)|attorneys]], [[United States military chaplains|chaplains]], [[Military engineering of the United States|civil engineers]], [[United States Air Force Medical Service |health services professionals]], and [[Navy Supply Corps (United States)|logistics and financial management specialists]]. A line officer may hold authority over a non-line officer of higher rank by the nature of their assignment or appointment/succession to command,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/US%20Navy%20Regulations/Chapter%2010%20-%20Precedence,%20Authority%20and%20Command.pdf|title=Chapter 10, PRECEDENCE, AUTHORITY AND COMMAND, Section 1. Precedence|last=U.S Navy Regulations|first=|date=2010|website=doni.documentservices.dla.mil|access-date=1 March 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is otherwise expected to observe normal customs and courtesies outside that role.

''See explanation of [[staff and line]].''

==History==
The expression "officer of the line" is possibly rooted in the 18th- and 19th-century [[Royal Navy]] practice of employing sail-powered warships in line formations to maximize the effectiveness of side-mounted cannons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  The ships were called [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and their officers were termed line officers.  The term also derives from "walking the line" and in many military circles is believed to have come from a "line in the sand" which two groups of officers once used in a political argument to gain power.{{clarify|date=May 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

===United States Navy===
{{US Navy Officer}}
In the [[United States Navy]] (and USN Reserve), line officers are divided into [[unrestricted line officer]]s, [[limited duty officers]],  and [[restricted line officer]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Unrestricted Line (URL) officers hold combat warfare specialties as [[Naval Aviator]]s and [[Naval Flight Officer]]s, [[Surface Warfare Officer]]s, Submarine Warfare Officers, and Naval Special Warfare/Naval Special Operations (NSW/NSO) officers (consisting of [[United States Navy SEALs|SEAL]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, Special Warfare Combatant-Craft (SWCC) Warrant Officers, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) officers, and Navy diving officers),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.navy.com/careers/special-operations|title=Careers in Special Warfare/Special Operations : Navy.com|website=www.navy.com|language=en|access-date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are eligible for operational combatant command at sea, as well as command of major installations and commands ashore.  Restricted Line officers command only within their particular specialty, and are normally in fields such as intelligence, cryptology, oceanography/meteorology, engineering duty, aeronautical engineering duty, aircraft maintenance, public affairs, etc.  

Navy Limited Duty Officers and Warrant Officers whose technical specialties fall within a staff corps are considered staff corps officers, while all others are classed of the Line.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Line officers wear an inverted gold star above their rank stripes on their dress blue uniforms and, in the case of Captains (US pay grade O-6/NATO OF-5) and below, on their shoulder boards in whites.  Line officer flag officers (admirals O-7 to O-10/NATO OF-6 to OF-9) will wear solid gold shoulder boards with a silver metallic thread anchor and one, two, three, or four silver metallic thread stars below the anchor.  When wearing khakis or utility/working uniforms, they wear their rank insignia on both collar points.  The Navy refers to non-line officers as [[List of United States Navy staff corps|Staff Corps officers]].  (Both line and staff corps officers may be assigned as "staff officers" serving on the command staff of a senior officer.) Staff corps officers wear their corps insignia, rather than the line officer star, placed over their sleeve/shoulder board stripes on their dress blue and dress white uniforms, and on their left collar point on khakis and utility/working uniforms in lieu of matching pin-on rank insignia on the right collar point.&lt;ref&gt;Mack, VADM William P. and Paulsen, CAPT Thomas D., ''The Naval Officer's Guide'', 9th ed., Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, c1983&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Marine Corps===
In the [[United States Marine Corps]] (and USMC Reserve), all officers – including [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant officer]]s and [[limited duty officer]]s (LDOs) – are line officers, trained to command combat units, although Marine officers cannot command ships or shore organizations of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doni.documentservices.dla.mil/US%20Navy%20Regulations/Chapter%2010%20-%20Precedence,%20Authority%20and%20Command.pdf|title=Chapter 10 – PRECEDENCE, AUTHORITY AND COMMAND, Section 2. Authority|last=U.S. Navy Regulations (2010)|first=|date=|website=doni.documentservices.dla.mil/|access-date=1 March 2017|quote=1030. Authority of an Officer of the Marine Corps Over Naval Forces.  Officers of the Marine Corps may not command ships or Navy shore facilities. This article shall not be construed to prevent an officer of the Marine Corps, when so detailed by the Secretary of the Navy or a commander in chief (sic), from having and exercising such authority as may be necessary to direct the operations of all forces assigned to him or her.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Navy, the Marine Corps does not have any staff corps, consequently all Marine engineer and supply officers, and judge advocates, are line officers.  The Marine Corps has no medical corps officers, dental corps officers, nurse corps officers, or chaplain corps officers. Because the Marine Corps is a service within the [[Department of the Navy]], these staff corps billets in the Marine Corps are normally filled by US Navy staff corps officers in those specialties, serving alongside Marines in Marine units, although officers of the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service may be detailed, as well.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===United States Air Force===
In the [[United States Air Force]] (and USAF Reserve), officers assigned to the medical, nurse, medical services (healthcare administration), biosciences, judge advocate, and chaplain corps are ''professional'' officers.  In addition to being professional officers, judge advocates in the Air Force are also considered line officers and, like all other officers in operational/combat and combat support specialties, belong to the Line of the Air Force (LAF).  The Air Force has no warrant officers.

===United States Coast Guard===
All [[Officer_(armed_forces)#Commissioned_officers|commissioned]] and [[Warrant Officer (United States)|warrant]] officers of the [[United States Coast Guard]] and [[United States Coast Guard Reserve]] are considered line officers. They wear the US Coast Guard shield in lieu of the inverted star of [[United States Navy|US Navy]] line officers on their shoulder boards and above the sleeve braid on dress uniforms. Like the [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine Corps]], the Coast Guard does have line officers serving as judge advocates, but has no officers serving as chaplains or in the health-care fields.

The expression "line officer" is no longer current in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] affiliates. Officers trained in the "Executive Department" of a warship are the only ones trained for command.
In the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], officers in the Naval Warfare Officer (NWO) occupation hold a similar function, but are not distinguished by any identifiable badge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

'''Livonian Coast''' ({{lang-liv|Līvõd Rānda|italic=no}}; {{lang-lv|Lībiešu krasts|italic=no}}) is a territory of [[Latvia]]  historically inhabited by [[Livonian people]]. It is located in Northern [[Courland]] and encompasses twelve Livonian villages. The protected area is about 60 kilometers long.

On February 4, 1992, the Latvian government created a culturally protected territory called ''{{lang|liv|Līvõd Rānda}}''&amp;nbsp;– the Livonian Coast&amp;nbsp;– which included all twelve of the Livonian villages: [[Lūžņa]] (Livonian: Lūž), [[Miķeļtornis]] (Pizā), [[Lielirbe]] (Īra), [[Jaunciems]] (Ūžkilā), [[Sīkrags]] (Sīkrõg), [[Mazirbe]] (Irē), [[Košrags]] (Kuoštrõg), [[Saunags]] (Sǟnag), [[Vaide]] (Vaid), [[Kolka, Latvia|Kolka]] (Kūolka) (see also [[Cape Kolka]]), [[Pitrags]] (Pitrõg), and [[Melnsils]] (Mustānum). The Latvian government discourages new settlements here and prohibits alterations to historical village sites. Also, it is restricted for anyone to start a hotel, restaurant, or other public establishment which might adversely influence the Livonian culture or draw outsiders into the area. However, there has been number old fishermen or farmer houses converted into modern summerhouses by Latvian higher class as well as some well-off descendants of local Liv families. Among them is former President of Latvia, former Prime Minister, Ministers, politicians, CEOs, bankers and businessmen, artists, doctors, etc. There are some prominent German, Russian and Swedish residents. The coast is also becoming more popular with Lithuanians. The Livonian Coast is part of [[Slītere National Park]].

== Local roads ==
Until [[World War I]] these villages were connected only by small forest roads along the coast and were practically inaccessible from inland. Most deliveries were made by the sea and most villages had their own [[pier]] (remains of piers can still be seen in [[Saunags]], [[Pitrags]] and [[Mazirbe]]; only [[Kolka, Latvia|Kolka]] pier is still in use). During World War I the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] built a [[narrow-gauge railway]] behind the dunes to move ammunition and wood. The railway connected [[Pitrags]], [[Mazirbe]] and [[Lielirbe]] with [[Dundaga]], a small regional town. Earthworks were installed to extend railway from [[Pitrags]] to [[Saunags]] and [[Vaide]], but the work was interrupted by moving front lines. Between the two wars, the railway was the main method for passenger transportation along the '''Livonian coast'''. After [[World War II]], in 1950s the [[Soviet Army]] built a wide dirt road connecting all the villages and the railway become obsolete. The railway was closed completely in 1960s, but there are several straight sections of roads or passages which still can be seen behind the dunes in [[Saunags]] and [[Pitrags]], and in forests in [[Mazirbe]] and [[Lielirbe]]. During 2009-2011 the dirt road was asphalted and modernised as part of [[European Union|EU]] funded [[Kolka, Latvia|Kolka]]-[[Ventspils]] road project. Several years ago replica [[Mazirbe]] railway station (original station is still standing now as a private house in [[Mazirbe]]) was re-created as part of narrow gauge railway line in [[Ventspils]], along with a restored engine and carriages, and is now used as a tourist attraction.

The '''Neo-Aramaic''' or '''Modern Aramaic''' languages are [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] of [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], that are spoken [[vernacular]]s from the medieval to modern era that evolved out of [[Imperial Aramaic]] via [[Middle Aramaic]] dialects, around AD 1200 (conventional date). 

The term strictly excludes those Aramaic languages that are used only as [[literary language|literary]], [[sacred language|sacred]] or [[classical language|classical]] languages today (for example, [[Targum|Targumic Aramaic]], [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]] and [[Mandaic language|Classical Mandaic]]). However, the classical languages continue to have influence over the colloquial Neo-Aramaic languages.

[[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] and [[Central Neo-Aramaic]] dialects are spoken primarily (though not wholly exclusively) by ethnic [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], who are members of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] (Eastern Rite Catholics), [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], [[Ancient Church of the East]], [[Assyrian Pentecostal Church]] and [[Assyrian Evangelical Church]]. The Assyrians are an [[indigenous people]] of [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]], descendants of the ancient [[Mesopotamians]].

Today the number of fluent Neo-Aramaic speakers is significantly smaller, and newer generations of [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] generally are not acquiring the full language, especially as many have emigrated and acculturated into their new resident countries.&lt;ref name="fp"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2014/08/14/islamic_state_aramaic_language_jesus_bible_destruction_yazidi_iraq |title=Is the Islamic State Exterminating the Language of Jesus? |last=Perlin |first=Ross |date=August 14, 2014 |work=[[Foreign Policy]] |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speakers==
The numbers of fluent speakers of Neo-Aramaic languages range from approximately 575,000 to 1,000,000. The largest of these are [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] with approximately 235,000 speakers, [[Chaldean Neo-Aramaic]] with approximately 216,000 speakers and [[Turoyo language|Surayt/Turoyo]] with approximately 250,000 speakers. While these are often associated with specific religious affiliations among Assyrians (Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Orthodox Church respectively) these dialects have speakers from different churches amongst their numbers, for example, a member of the Chaldean Catholic Church may speak Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, and a member of the Assyrian Church of the East or Syriac Orthodox Church may speak Chaldean Neo-Aramaic. There are also smaller numbers of speakers of smaller [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] languages, notably Jews originally from [[Kurdistan]], in approximate number of dozens of thousands of speakers in [[Israel]], [[Western Neo-Aramaic]], [[Judeo-Aramaic languages]] and [[Neo-Mandaic]].

==History==
Throughout the history of the Aramaic language, a clear dialect boundary dividing western and eastern varieties has existed, running transversely across the Syrian Desert from southeast to northwest. Eastern Aramaic has remained dominant throughout history, and all classical languages are eastern varieties originating in [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Assyria]]-[[Babylonia]]). Only [[Western Neo-Aramaic]], spoken in [[Maaloula]] and surrounding villages in the [[Anti-Lebanon]] by [[Assyrian people|Syriac]]-[[Aramean]] Christian communities, remains as a witness to the once widespread western varieties of the [[Levant]] and [[Transjordan (region)|Transjordan]].

Neo-Aramaic languages are not uniform; they grew out of pockets of Aramaic-speaking communities that have held fast to their language through the changes of past centuries. Therefore, the [[dialect continuum]] is incomplete, with many varieties absent. Mutual intelligibility between the varieties of the group is limited to closest neighbours only. However, many of the varieties share features that have developed in parallel from Middle Aramaic varieties and the classical languages.

==Varieties==
The other Neo-Aramaic languages are all eastern varieties, but with little homogeneity. Most distinct in this group is [[Mandaic language|Modern Mandaic]], which has low intelligibility with other varieties. It is the direct descendant of Classical Mandaic, which traces its roots back to the [[Persian language|Persian]]-influenced Aramaic of the [[Arsacid Empire]]. Modern Mandaic is spoken fluently by about 6,000 people&lt;ref&gt;Mandaic at Ethnologue (18th ed., 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; mostly in [[Ahvaz]], [[Iran]], all of whom are [[Mandaeanism|Mandaeans]], a [[Gnostic]] [[ethnic minority]] with approximately 70,000 followers in [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]], most of whom have largely adopted [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Persian language|Persian]] despite being non-Arab and non-Iranian ethnically.

The other Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages have a lot more in common with each other. Some studies have labelled this group ''Central Neo-Aramaic'' (however, that name is also used for a smaller subgrouping) or ''Northern Neo-Aramaic''. These languages can be divided in various ways. Sometimes they are divided by religion into Jewish and Christian varieties. However, there is not complete intelligibility throughout either religious community, and on occasion better intelligibility across the religious divide. From this group, the Christian varieties of the extreme north-west of [[Mesopotamia]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Central Neo-Aramaic]] (confusingly different from the definition above){{spaced ndash}}stand apart. 

This subgrouping is witnessed by [[Turoyo language|Turoyo]] ({{smallcaps|aka}} Surayt) and the now [[extinct language|extinct]] [[Mlahsô language|Mlahsô]], both influenced by the [[Syriac language|Classical Syriac]] of Sassanid Assyria ([[Assuristan]]). The other varieties, both Jewish and Christian, form the largest subgrouping of Neo-Aramaic, which is usually referred to as [[Northeastern Neo-Aramaic]] (NENA). Christian NENA varieties are influenced by Classical Syriac, but to a lesser degree than Central Neo-Aramaic, and appear to retain some [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] loan words and grammatical structures; Jewish NENA varieties are influenced by [[Targum|Targumic Aramaic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20130">In [[computer science]], more specifically in [[automata theory|automata]] and [[formal language]] theory, '''nested words''' are a concept proposed by [[Rajeev Alur|Alur]] and Madhusudan as a joint generalization of [[String (computer science)|words]], as traditionally used for modelling [[linearly ordered]] structures, and of ordered unranked [[Tree (data structure)|trees]], as traditionally used for modelling hierarchical structures. Finite-state acceptors for nested words,
so-called '''nested word automata''', then give a more expressive generalization of [[nondeterministic finite automaton|finite automata]] on words. The linear encodings of languages accepted by finite nested word automata gives the class of '''visibly pushdown languages'''. The latter language class lies properly between the [[regular language]]s and the [[deterministic context-free language]]s. Since their introduction in 2004, these concepts have triggered much research in that area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;as_oq=%22nested+words%22+%22visibly+pushdown%22 Google Scholar search results] for "nested words" OR "visibly pushdown"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal definition==
To define ''nested words'', we first need to define ''matching relation''. As usual, for a [[nonnegative integer]] &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, we use the notation &lt;math&gt;[\ell]&lt;/math&gt; to denote the set &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,\ldots,\ell-1,\ell\}&lt;/math&gt;, with the special case &lt;math&gt;[0]=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.

A ''matching relation'' ↝ of length &lt;math&gt;\ell\ge 0&lt;/math&gt; is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\{-\infty, 1,2,\ldots,\ell-1,\ell\}\times\{1,2,\ldots,\ell-1,\ell,\infty\}&lt;/math&gt; such that:
# all nesting edges are forward, that is, if ''i''&amp;nbsp;↝&amp;nbsp;''j'' then ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''j''; 
# nesting edges never have a finite position in common, that is, for −∞&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞, there is at most one position ''h'' such that ''h''&amp;nbsp;↝&amp;nbsp;''i'', and there is at most one position ''j'' such that ''i'' ↝ ''j''; and
# nesting edges never cross, that is, we can't find ''i''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime; such that both ''i''&amp;nbsp;↝&amp;nbsp;''j'' and ''i''’&amp;nbsp;↝&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;prime;.
A position ''i'' is referred to as 
* a ''call position'', if ''i'' ↝ ''j'' for some ''j'', 
* a ''pending call'' if ''i'' ↝ ∞, 
* a ''return position'', if ''h'' ↝ ''i'' for some ''h'', 
* a ''pending return'' if −∞ ↝ ''i'', and
* an ''internal position'' in all remaining cases.

A ''nested word'' of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;  over an [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]] Σ is a pair (''w'',↝), where ''w'' is a word of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;over Σ (in the usual sense) and ↝ is a matching relation of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;.

==Encoding nested words into ordinary words==
Nested words over the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt; can be encoded into "ordinary" words over the ''tagged alphabet'' &lt;math&gt; \hat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;, in which each symbol ''a'' from Σ has three tagged counterparts: the
symbol '''⟨a''' for encoding a call position in a nested word labelled with ''a'', the symbol '''a⟩''' for encoding a return position labelled with ''a'', and finally the symbol '''a''' itself for representing an internal position labelled with ''a''. More precisely, let ''φ'' be the function mapping nested words over Σ to words over &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; such that each nested word (&lt;math&gt;w_1w_2\cdots w_\ell&lt;/math&gt;,↝) is mapped to the word &lt;math&gt;x_1x_2...x_\ell&lt;/math&gt;, where the letter &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; equals '''⟨a''', '''a''', and '''a⟩''', if &lt;math&gt;w_i=a&lt;/math&gt; and ''i'' is a (possibly pending) call position, an internal position, and a (possibly pending) return position, respectively.

===Example===
For illustration, let ''n''=(''w'',↝) be the nested word over a ternary alphabet with ''w''=''abaabccca'' and matching relation {{math|1=↝ = {(−∞,1),(2,∞),(3,4),(5,7),(8,∞)}}}. Then its encoding as word reads as ''φ''(''n'') = ''a''⟩⟨''b''⟨''aa''⟩⟨''bcc''⟩⟨''ca''.

==Automata==

===Nested word automaton===
A ''nested word automaton'' has a finite number of states, and operates in almost the same way as a [[deterministic finite automaton]] on classical strings: a classical finite automaton reads the input word &lt;math&gt;w = w_1\cdots w_\ell&lt;/math&gt; from left to right, and the state of the automaton after reading the ''j''th letter &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt; depends on the state in which the automaton was before reading &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;.

In a nested word automaton, the position &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; in the nested word (w,↝) might be a return position; if so, the state after reading &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt; will not only depend on the ''linear state'' in which the automaton was before reading &lt;math&gt;w_j&lt;/math&gt;, but also on a ''hierarchical state'' propagated by the automaton at the time it was in the corresponding call position. In analogy to [[regular language]]s of words, a set  ''L'' of nested words is called ''regular'' if it is accepted by some (finite-state) nested word automaton.

===Visibly pushdown automaton===
Nested word automata are an automaton model accepting nested words. There is an equivalent automaton model operating on (ordinary) words. Namely, the notion of a '''deterministic visibly pushdown automaton''' is a restriction of the notion of a [[deterministic pushdown automaton]].

Following Alur and Madhusudan,&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu09"&gt;{{harvtxt|Alur|Madhusudan|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deterministic visibly pushdown automaton is formally defined as a 6-tuple &lt;math&gt;M=(Q, \hat{\Sigma}, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, F)&lt;/math&gt;
where
*&lt;math&gt;Q &lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''states'',
*&lt;math&gt;\hat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''input alphabet'', which – in contrast to that of ordinary pushdown automata – is partitioned into three sets &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\text{int}&lt;/math&gt;. The alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of ''call symbols'', &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; contains the ''return symbols'', and the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_\text{int}&lt;/math&gt; contains the ''internal symbols'',
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set which is called the ''stack alphabet'', containing a special symbol &lt;math&gt;\bot\in\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; denoting the empty stack,
*&lt;math&gt;\delta = \delta_\text{c} \cup \delta_\text{r} \cup \delta_\text{int}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''transition function'', which is partitioned into three parts corresponding to call transitions, return transitions, and internal transitions, namely
**&lt;math&gt;\delta_\text{c}\colon Q \times \Sigma_\text{c} \to Q \times \Gamma&lt;/math&gt;, the ''call transition function''
**&lt;math&gt;\delta_\text{r}\colon Q \times \Sigma_\text{r} \times \Gamma \to Q &lt;/math&gt;, the ''return transition function''
**&lt;math&gt;\delta_\text{int}:Q \times \Sigma_\text{int} \to Q&lt;/math&gt;, the ''internal transition function'',
*&lt;math&gt;q_0\in\, Q &lt;/math&gt; is the ''initial state'', and
*&lt;math&gt;F \subseteq Q&lt;/math&gt; is the set of ''accepting states''.

The notion of ''computation'' of a visibly pushdown automaton is a restriction of the one used for [[Pushdown automaton#Formal Definition|pushdown automata]]. Visibly pushdown automata only add a symbol to the stack when reading a call symbol &lt;math&gt;a_\text{c}\in \Sigma_\text{c}&lt;/math&gt;, they only remove the top element from the stack when reading a return symbol &lt;math&gt;a_\text{r}\in\Sigma_\text{r}&lt;/math&gt; and they do not alter the stack when reading an internal event &lt;math&gt;a_\text{i}\in\Sigma_\text{int}&lt;/math&gt;. A computation ending in an accepting state is an ''accepting computation''.

As a result, a visibly pushdown automaton cannot push to and pop from the stack with the same input symbol. Thus the language &lt;math&gt;L=\{a^nba^n \mid n\in\mathrm{N} \}&lt;/math&gt; cannot be accepted by a visibly pushdown automaton for any partition of &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, however there are pushdown automata accepting this language.

If a [[Formal language|language]] &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; over a tagged alphabet &lt;math&gt;\hat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is accepted by a deterministic visibly pushdown automaton, then &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''visibly pushdown language''.

===Nondeterministic visibly pushdown automata===
[[Nondeterministic finite automaton|Nondeterministic]] visibly pushdown automata are as expressive as deterministic ones. Hence one can transform a nondeterministic visibly pushdown automaton into a deterministic one, but if the nondeterministic automaton had &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; states, the deterministic one may have up to &lt;math&gt;2^{s^2}&lt;/math&gt; states.&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu04"&gt;{{harvtxt|Alur|Madhusudan|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision problems==
Let &lt;math&gt;|A|&lt;/math&gt; be the size of the description of an automaton &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then it is possible to check if a word ''n'' is accepted by the automaton in time &lt;math&gt;O(|A|^3\ell)&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the emptiness problem is solvable in time &lt;math&gt;O(|A|^3)&lt;/math&gt;.
If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is fixed, it is decidable in time &lt;math&gt;O(\ell)&lt;/math&gt; and space &lt;math&gt;O(d)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of ''n'' in a streaming seeing. It is also decidable with space &lt;math&gt;O(\log(\ell))&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;O(\ell^2 \log (\ell))&lt;/math&gt;, and by a uniform boolean circuit of depth &lt;math&gt;O(\log \ell)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu09" /&gt;

For two nondeterministic automata ''A'' and ''B'', deciding whether the set of words accepted by ''A'' is a subset of the word accepted by ''B'' is [[EXPTIME]]-complete. It is also EXPTIME-complete to figure out if there is a word that is not accepted.&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu09" /&gt;

==Languages==
As the definition of visibly pushdown automata shows, deterministic visibly pushdown automata can be seen as a special case of [[deterministic pushdown automata]]; thus the set '''VPL''' of visibly pushdown languages over &lt;math&gt;\,\hat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt; forms a subset of the set '''DCFL''' of [[deterministic context-free language]]s over the set of symbols in &lt;math&gt;\,\hat{\Sigma}&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, the function that removes the matching relation from nested words transforms regular languages over nested words into context-free languages.

===Closure properties===
The set of visibly pushdown languages is closed under the following operations:&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu04" /&gt;
*set operations:
**union
**intersection
**complement, 
:thus giving rise to a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|boolean algebra]].
*[[Kleene star]]
*[[Concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]]

For the intersection operation, one can construct a VPA ''M'' simulating two given VPAs &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; by a simple product construction {{harv|Alur|Madhusudan|2004}}: For &lt;math&gt;i=1,2&lt;/math&gt;, assume &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is given as &lt;math&gt;(Q_i,\  \hat{\Sigma},\  \Gamma_i,\  \delta_i, \ s_{i},\ Z_i, \ F_i)&lt;/math&gt;. Then for the automaton ''M'', the set of states is &lt;math&gt;\, Q_1\times Q_2&lt;/math&gt;, the initial state is &lt;math&gt;\left(s_{1}, s_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;, the set of final states is &lt;math&gt;F_1 \times F_2&lt;/math&gt;, the stack alphabet is given by &lt;math&gt;\,\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2&lt;/math&gt;, and the initial stack symbol is &lt;math&gt;(Z_1,Z_2)&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is in state &lt;math&gt;(p_1,p_2)&lt;/math&gt; on reading a ''call symbol'' &lt;math&gt;\left\langle a\right.&lt;/math&gt;, then
&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; pushes the stack symbol &lt;math&gt;(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)&lt;/math&gt;
and goes to state &lt;math&gt;(q_1,q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the stack symbol pushed by &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;
when transitioning from state &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; on reading input &lt;math&gt;\left\langle a\right.&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is in state &lt;math&gt;(p_1,p_2)&lt;/math&gt; on reading an ''internal symbol'' &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;
goes to state &lt;math&gt;(q_1,q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;
transitions from state &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; on reading ''a''.

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is in state &lt;math&gt;(p_1,p_2)&lt;/math&gt; on reading a ''return symbol'' &lt;math&gt;\left. a\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;
pops the symbol &lt;math&gt;(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)&lt;/math&gt; from the stack and
goes to state &lt;math&gt;(q_1,q_2)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\gamma_i&lt;/math&gt; is the stack symbol popped by &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt;
when transitioning from state &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;q_i&lt;/math&gt; on reading &lt;math&gt;\left. a\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

Correctness of the above construction crucially relies on the fact that the push and pop actions of the simulated
machines &lt;math&gt;M_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_2&lt;/math&gt; are synchronized along the input symbols read. In fact, a similar simulation is no longer possible for [[deterministic pushdown automaton|deterministic pushdown automata]], as the larger class of deterministic context-free languages is no longer closed under intersection.

In contrast to the construction for concatenation shown above, the complementation construction for visibly pushdown automata parallels the standard construction&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Hopcroft|Ullman|1979|p=238 f}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for deterministic pushdown automata.

Moreover, like the class of context free languages the class of visibly pushdown languages is closed under [[String operations#Prefixes|prefix closure]] and reversal, hence also suffix closure.

===Relation to other language classes===
{{harvtxt|Alur|Madhusudan|2004}} point out that the visibly pushdown languages are more general than the parenthesis languages suggested in {{harvtxt|McNaughton|1967}}. As shown by {{harvtxt|Crespi Reghizzi|Mandrioli|2012}}, the VPL in turn are strictly contained in the class of languages described by [[operator-precedence grammar]]s, which were introduced by {{harvtxt|Floyd|1963}} and enjoy the same closure properties and characteristics (see {{harvtxt|Lonati|Mandrioli|Panella|Pradella|2015}} for ω languages and logic and automata-based characterizations). In comparison to [[conjunctive grammars]], a generalization of context-free grammars, {{harvtxt|Okhotin|2011}} shows that the linear conjunctive languages form a superclass of the visibly pushdown languages. The table at the end of this article puts the family of visibly pushdown languages in relation to other language families in the [[Chomsky hierarchy]].

==Other models of description==

===Visibly pushdown grammars===
Visibly pushdown languages are exactly the languages that can be described by ''visibly pushdown grammars''.&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu09" /&gt;

Visibly pushdown grammars can be defined as a restriction of [[Context-free grammar#Formal definitions|context-free grammars]]. A visibly pushdown grammar ''G'' is defined by the 4-[[tuple]]:

&lt;math&gt;G = (V=V^0\cup V^1\,, \Sigma\,, R\,, S\,)&lt;/math&gt; where
*&lt;math&gt;V^0\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V^1\, &lt;/math&gt; are disjoint finite sets; each element &lt;math&gt; v\in V&lt;/math&gt; is called ''a non-terminal character'' or a ''variable''. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by &lt;math&gt;G\, &lt;/math&gt;, and the sub-languages of &lt;math&gt;V^0\, &lt;/math&gt; are the one without pending calls or pending returns.
*&lt;math&gt;\Sigma\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of ''terminal''s, disjoint from &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt;, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar &lt;math&gt;G\, &lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; is a finite relation from &lt;math&gt;V\,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(V\cup\Sigma)^{*}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\exist\, w\in (V\cup\Sigma)^{*}: (S,w)\in R&lt;/math&gt;. The members of &lt;math&gt;R\,&lt;/math&gt; are called the ''(rewrite) rule''s or ''production''s of the grammar. There are three kinds of rewrite rules. For &lt;math&gt;X,Y\in V ,Z\in V^0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a\in \hat\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b\in \hat\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;X\to \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;X\to aY&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;X\in V^0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;Y\in V^0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\in \Sigma&lt;/math&gt;
**&lt;math&gt;X\to \langle aZb\rangle Y&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;X\in V^0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;Y\in V^0&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;S\in V\,&lt;/math&gt; is the ''start variable'' (or ''start symbol''), used to represent the whole sentence (or program).

Here, the asterisk represents the [[Kleene star]] operation and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is the empty word.

===Uniform Boolean circuits===
The problem whether a word of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is accepted by a given nested word automaton can be solved by uniform [[boolean circuit]]s of depth &lt;math&gt;\Omicron(\log\ell)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu09" /&gt;

===Logical description===
Regular languages over nested words are exactly the set of languages described by [[Monadic predicate calculus|Monadic]] [[SO (complexity)|second-order logic]] with two unary predicates ''call'' and ''return'', linear successor and the matching relation ↝.&lt;ref name="AlurMadhu09" /&gt;

'''P2''' is the abbreviation for a type of residential [[Plattenbau|panel building]] found in former [[East Germany]]. The '''P''' stands for ''[[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]]'' and refers to [[load-bearing walls]] arranged parallel to wall surfaces. '''2''' denotes the arrangement of two stairways in a building.

The first building of this type was built in 1961 as an experimental building in [[Berlin-Lichtenberg]]. The original building was located at Erich-Kuttner-Straße 9-15 in the [[Fennpfuhl|Fennpfuhl district]] and is now a [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;P2 in the experimental building monument Erich Kuttner-Straße 9 / 15, tenement, 1961-62 by Achim Felz, Herbert and Wilfrid Kuschy Stallknecht [http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DWBS%2B70%26hl%3Den%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/cgi-bin/hidaweb/getdoc.pl%3FDOK_TPL%3Dlda_doc.tpl%26KEY%3Dobj%252009040232&amp;usg=ALkJrhh3iWb7p8WTyRGzO6n68TNHRlcdpQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stairs and arrangement of dwellings==

A P2 building is characterized by the arrangement of apartments around a nearly square interior stairwell, often equipped with a glass roof. The buildings have five to eleven stories and there are usually two apartments per floor, although some designs have three apartments per floor, above and below the stairwell access.

==Floors==

As a standard design, the P2 is five or six stories high, with the lowest floor raised half a story above the ground. This allows natural light and ventilation to the [[basement]], and minimizes the excavation required for the foundation.  The building interior can be accessed by way of an outdoor stairway or via a half-staircase in the entrance area.

The staircase and access area reduce the amount of space available for a ground floor apartment. Therefore the ground floor arrangement consists of a four-room apartment and a one-bedroom apartment - unlike the symmetric three-bedroom apartments on the upper floors. The remaining space is configured as a hallway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DWBS%2B70%26hl%3Den%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Dimvns&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=de&amp;u=http://www.urbikon.com/index.php%3Farticle_id%3D72&amp;usg=ALkJrhiCwhzHYYGrXOGfyjFYj5Lds0pUdQ P2 User study]&lt;/ref&gt;

In P2-buildings with more than six stories, every third floor has a ''distribution hallway''. The hallway is usually located on the entrance side of a building and serves as the access or entrance to stairwells, elevators, waste discharge and storerooms. The apartments located above or below the distribution hallways are not accessed directly from the elevator, but via a staircase. Typically the distribution hallways are arranged like this:

* P2/10 (with 10 stories): first, third, sixth and ninth floors
* P2/11 (with 11 stories): first, fourth, seventh and tenth floors (Seventh floor has an emergency exit passage connecting to a neighboring building).

==Apartment==


As a standard, apartments in P2-buildings have one-to-four rooms. In buildings with special elements, such as a trapezoidal shape, there are also 5-room apartments with two rooms that have no right angles.

Originally there were no [[loggia]]s on the raised ground floor. Ground floor loggias were added later in the course of reconstruction work.

==Kitchens and baths==


[[File:P2 Wohnraum mit Durchreiche zur Kueche.jpg|thumb|Kitchen hatch]]
The novelty of the bathrooms and kitchens is optimization of space.  The bathrooms and kitchens are located inside and next to each other and they utilize the same supply shaft for water, sewage and ventilation. Bathrooms are fully equipped sanitary room modules (including toilet, sink, tub, faucets and washing machine connection; and kitchen modules include vertical supply and disposal lines. During construction they are lifted into the shell construction in one piece. The bathroom and kitchen modules require a simple connection to the pipes at ground level for installation. The walls of the service shaft are made of different materials, ranging from press board over plaster to massive concrete elements.

The designers avoided the typical kitchen and separate dining room arrangement, which required a lengthwise format and separated the family during meal preparation.  This arrangement reduced living space and therefore reduced expenses. The designers hoped to integrate women more effectively into the family by opening the kitchen to the living room and thereby encouraging men to participate in the household. The kitchens were initially connected to the living rooms by large service hatches in the form of built-in furniture.

After widespread criticism that the kitchen was not isolated enough from the living room, later buildings incorporated concrete walls with a small hatch window. In the last series produced, the kitchen was completely separated from the living room by a wall. Daylight fell into the kitchen only through the door or service hatch.

On the term "paraliterature", [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] commented that "it exists. What I'm saying is that I don't want to ''perpetuate'' this division. So I would always put it in quotes, or do something to show that I'm rejecting a word that I have to use".{{sfn|Le Guin|2008|p=110}}

'''Paraujano''' is an Arawakan language spoken by the Paraujano, or Anu͂, people of [[Venezuela]]. The Paraujano live by [[Lake Maracaibo]], [[Zulia|Zulia State]], in Northwest Venezuela.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue" /&gt;

==General Information==
The Paraujanos call themselves the Anu͂, which means ‘people’. They received the name Paraujano from the neighboring Guajiros. The combination of ''palaa'', meaning ‘sea’, and ''anu͂'' literally means ‘people of the sea’, or fishermen. The Paraujano live in [[stilt houses|palafittes]] and are skilled at fishing at boating.
According to a 2011 census, more than 21,000 people identify as Paraujano.&lt;ref name="Sabogal" /&gt;

===Classification===
Paraujano is a Northern Arawakan, or [[arawakan languages|Maipuran]], language. It is derived from [[Wayuu language|Gaujiro]], yet is a distinct language and not a dialect of Gaujiro. The two languages are closely related. According to lexicostatistical analysis conducted by Oliver (1989) the two languages must have diverged around A.D. 900.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oliver|first1=José R.|title=The Archaeological, Linguistic and Ethnohistorical Evidence for the Expansion of Arawakan into Northwestern Venezuela and Northeastern Colombia|date=1989|location=Urbana, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status and Speakers===
Paraujano is critically endangered&lt;ref name="EL"&gt;{{cite web|title=Paraujano|url=http://www.endangeredlanguages.com/lang/1573|website=The Endangered Languages Project|publisher=The Alliance for Linguistic Diversity|accessdate=4 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nearly extinct.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Paraujano|editor1-last=Lewis|editor1-first=M.

As the Paraujano mingled with others early on, their language was spread and spoken by some newcomers. However, by the 1970s there were only thirteen speakers remaining. Today there is one surviving fluent speaker, a thirty-year-old by the name of Yofri Márquez, who learned the language from his grandmother. There are a few partial speakers, most of whom are elderly. Revitalization efforts include Paraujano instruction in six regional elementary schools and the establishment of various cultural organizations.&lt;ref name="Sabogal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sabogal|first1=Andrés Mauricio|title=The revival of Añunnükü or Paraujano language|journal=Proceedings of the High Desert Linguists Society|volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lexicon==
Paraujano has incorporated some Spanish words into its vocabulary. Out the eighty-nine available words from the [[Swadesh list]], six are Spanish substitutes.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

==Phonology==
The Paraujano phoneme contains 14 [[pulmonic consonant]]s and 11 vowels.

The Paraujano phoneme differs from closely related Guajiro, mainly in vowels and due to the incorporation of Spanish lexicon. There are a number of allophones in Paraujano. Among these allophones, there is a tendency toward [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatization]] or [[nasalization]].&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14672">'''Police perjury''' (or '''testilying''' in [[United States police]] [[slang]]) is the act of a [[police officer]] giving [[Perjury|false testimony]]. It is typically used in a criminal trial to "make the case" against a defendant believed by the police to be guilty when irregularities during the suspect's arrest or search threaten to result in acquittal.

It also can be extended further to encompass substantive misstatements of fact for the purpose of convicting those whom the police believe to be guilty, or even to include statements to frame an innocent citizen.&lt;ref name="Slobogin"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.constitution.org/lrev/slobogin_testilying.htm |journal=[[University of Colorado Law Review]] |date=Fall 1996 |title=Reform The Police: TESTILYING: POLICE PERJURY AND WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT |first1=Christopher |last1=Slobogin |volume=67 |page=1037 |publisher=[[University of Colorado Law School]] |location=Boulder, Colorado |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More generically, it has been said to be "[l]ying under oath, especially by a police officer, to help get a conviction."&lt;ref name="McFedries"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wordspy.com/words/testilying.asp |first1=Paul |last1=McFedries |publisher=Word Spy |title=testilying |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
===Etymology===
''Testilying'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''testify'' and ''lying''. Defendants who embellish their own testimony, particularly when no evidence contradicts them, can also be said to be testilying. It is said to be a type of [[police corruption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |work=The Encyclopedia of Police Science |volume=1 |first1=Jack R., Editor |last1=Greene |publisher=Routledge/Amazon Digital Services, Inc. |edition=3rd |location=New York |date=October 23, 2003 |pages=273–275, 401 |first2=Kristen J. |last2=Kuehhnle  |isbn=041564223X &lt;!--|ISBN=978-0415642231 --&gt; |title=Courtroom testimony and "Testilying"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Published usage===
The word ''testilying'' and its meaning have been publicized by defense attorney [[Alan Dershowitz]], notably in a 1994 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, "Accomplices to Perjury", in which he said: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;As I read about the disbelief expressed by some prosecutors... I thought of [[Claude Rains]]'s classic response, in ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' on being told there was gambling in Rick's place: "I'm shocked—shocked." For anyone who has practiced criminal law in the state or Federal courts, the disclosures about rampant police [[perjury]] cannot possibly come as a surprise. "Testilying"—as the police call it—has long been an open secret among prosecutors, defense lawyers, and judges.&lt;ref name="Dershowitz1"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 2, 1994 |page=A1 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07EFDD1030F931A35756C0A962958260 |title=Accomplices to Perjury |first1=Alan |last1=Dershowitz |authorlink=Alan Dershowitz |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Testimony on Testilying |first1=Alan M. |last1=Dershowitz |publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] Judiciary Committee |date=December 1, 1998 |url=http://www.constitution.org/lrev/dershowitz_test_981201.htm |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There seems to be little doubt that the practice occurs, is not limited to any region of the country, and that "testilying" is a common name for it. A 2003 ''[[Boston Globe]]'' editorial noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the early 1990s, the [[Mollen Commission]] peeled away layers of falsehood in the [[New York City Police Department]], including false statements on warrant applications, creation of confidential informants out of whole cloth, and lies told to establish probable cause for stopping and searching vehicles. So-called "testilying," however, is not limited to any one area or police department. The problem has become so acute that juries nationwide routinely express skepticism about law enforcement testimony, such as drugs found "[[Plain view doctrine|in plain view]]".{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] is said to call the practice "joining the liars' club". In a 1996 article in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars' Club?," Joseph D. McNamara, then chief of police of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], said "Not many people took defense attorney Alan M. Dershowitz seriously when he charged that Los Angeles cops are taught to lie at the birth of their careers at the Police Academy. But as someone who spent 35 years wearing a police uniform, I've come to believe that hundreds of thousands of law-enforcement officers commit felony perjury every year testifying about drug arrests." He noted that "Within the last few years, police departments in Los Angeles, Boston, New Orleans, San Francisco, Denver, New York and in other large cities have suffered scandals involving police personnel lying under oath about drug evidence."&lt;ref name="McNamara"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 11, 1996 |title=Has the Drug War Created an Officer Liars' Club? |url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/debate/mcn/mcn6.htm |first1=Joseph D. |last1=McNamara |accessdate=December 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police officers who have been dishonest are sometimes referred to as "Brady cops". In ''[[Brady v. Maryland]]'', the Supreme Court held that prosecutors are required to notify defendants and their attorneys of any favorable evidence, such as if a law enforcement official involved in their case has a sustained record for knowingly lying in an official capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Kamb |author2=Nalder, Eric |title=Cops who lie don't always lose jobs |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/349169_lying29.html |newspaper=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=January 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence===
The extent of the practice is hotly debated. Rank and file policemen, police advocates and police unions acknowledge that it does occur but deny that it is widespread or systemic. In 1995, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that New York Police Commissioner [[William J. Bratton]] created a furor when he said he agreed with most of what Dershowitz had to say.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bratton calls 'testilying' by police a real concern |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/403741016.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Flint%2C+Anthony&amp;pub=Boston+Globe&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Bratton+calls+%27testilying%27+by+police+a+real+concern|agency=[[Boston Globe]]|date=15 November 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Globe'' quoted Richard Bradley, president of the [[Boston Police]] Patrolmen's Association: "I find it incredible that he would say that. Every day all over the country, police officers are testifying. Everyone realizes they are testifying under oath. If this was this much a problem, it would have come to light over the years." Bradley said that in 27 years on the Boston force he had never encountered the practice. In 2011, former San Francisco Police Commissioner Peter Keane wrote that lying under oath was a  "routine practice" for narcotics officers.&lt;ref name="Keane-2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Keane|first1=Peter|title=Why cops lie|url=http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Why-cops-lie-2388737.php|website=SFGate|accessdate=13 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417222818/http://www.sfgate.com/opinion/openforum/article/Why-cops-lie-2388737.php|archivedate=14 April 2014|date=15 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the alleged beneficent public purpose behind police telling lies{{mdash}}thus the use of the term "testilying" to make clear the fact that these are intentional lies{{mdash}}the existence has severe repercussions. Police officers can put their livelihood and their pension on the line in furtherance of a conspiracy. And if they are caught in the lie, guilty criminal defendants be set free because of otherwise unwarranted acquittals, or because the evidence is tossed at a suppression hearing. And, of course, when the police lie under oath, innocent people can be convicted and jailed. Hundreds of convictions have been set aside as a result of such scandals.&lt;ref name="Rocieniewski"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pshell/gammage/testimonies/testilying-in-ny.html |title=Testilying in New York: "Most of the officers at the 30th Precinct during that time were lying about arrests they were making. That's just the way things were done." |date=January 5, 1997 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=December 26, 2012 |first1=David |last1=Rocieniewski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources say it is both a police and prosecutorial problem, and is a systemic response to the [[fruit of the poisonous tree]] doctrine recognized in ''[[Mapp v. Ohio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.vice.com/read/testilying-cops-are-liars-who-get-away-with-perjury |title=Testilying: Cops are liars who get away with perjury |first1=Nick |last1=Malinowski |date=February 3, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have drawn a connection between perjury and an increased emphasis on the number of arrests and convictions made.&lt;ref name="Keane-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=alexander-2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Michelle|title=Why Police Lie Under Oath|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/why-police-officers-lie-under-oath.html|website=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729224558/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/why-police-officers-lie-under-oath.html?_r=0|archivedate=29 July 2014|date=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, after finding a police officer, Jason Arbeeny, guilty of official misconduct for planting drugs on a suspect, Justice Gustin L. Reichbach of the [[New York Supreme Court]] wrote that he "thought [he] was not naïve, but even this court was shocked, not only by the seeming pervasive scope of misconduct but even more distressingly by the seeming casualness by which such conduct is employed".&lt;ref name=stolarik-2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolarik|first1=Robert|title=Detective Is Found Guilty of Planting Drugs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/nyregion/brooklyn-detective-convicted-of-planting-drugs-on-innocent-people.html?pagewanted=all|website=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=13 March 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625164640/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/nyregion/brooklyn-detective-convicted-of-planting-drugs-on-innocent-people.html?pagewanted=all|archivedate=25 June 2012|date=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ex police detective was then sentenced to five years of probation and 300 hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;Yaniv, Oren.

Retrieved on 27 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remedies==
Some suggest that narrowing or blunting the exclusionary rule may get rid of the incentive for testilying. This has happened to the extent that court in the United States have recognized "good faith" exceptions.  Some argue that increased civil liability may have a prophylactic effect on police misconduct.  Others suggest that the ubiquity of video recordings, both by the police and civilians, will operate to slow down the misconduct and reverse the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-watch/wp/2014/04/16/how-do-we-fix-the-police-testilying-problem/ |title=The Watch: How do we fix the police ‘testilying’ problem? |first1=Radley |last1=Balko |date=April 16, 2014 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=July 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Certainty}}
A '''proof''' is  [[Necessity and sufficiency|sufficient]] [[evidence]] or a sufficient [[argument]] for the [[truth]] of a [[proposition]].&lt;ref&gt;''Proof and other dilemmas: mathematics and philosophy'' by [[Bonnie Gold]], Roger A. Simons 2008 {{ISBN|0883855674}} pages 12–20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophical Papers, Volume 2'' by Imre Lakatos, John Worrall, Gregory Currie, ISBN Philosophical Papers, Volume 2 by Imre Lakatos, John Worrall, Gregory Currie 1980 {{ISBN|0521280303}} pages 60–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Evidence, proof, and facts: a book of sources'' by Peter Murphy 2003 {{ISBN|0199261954}} pages 1–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Logic in Theology – And Other Essays'' by Isaac Taylor 2010 {{ISBN|1445530139}} pages 5–15&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept applies in a variety of disciplines,&lt;ref&gt;
Compare {{Bibleverse|1 Thessalonians|5:21|KJV}}: "Prove all things [...]."
&lt;/ref&gt;
with both the nature of the evidence or justification and the criteria for sufficiency being area-dependent. In the area of oral and written [[communication]] such as [[conversation]], [[dialog]], [[rhetoric]], etc., a proof is a [[persuasive]] [[perlocutionary act|perlocutionary]] [[speech act]], which demonstrates the truth of a proposition.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Langshaw Austin]]: ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]''. Cambridge (Mass.) 1962 – Paperback: [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition, 2005, {{ISBN|0-674-41152-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In any area of [[mathematics]] defined by its assumptions or [[axioms]], a proof is an argument establishing a [[theorem]] of that area via accepted [[rules of inference]] starting from those axioms and from other previously established theorems.&lt;ref&gt;Cupillari, Antonella. The Nuts and Bolts of Proofs. Academic Press, 2001. Page 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject of [[logic]], in particular [[proof theory]], formalizes and studies the notion of [[formal proof]].&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Tarski, Introduction to Logic and to the Methodology of the Deductive Sciences (ed. Jan Tarski). 4th Edition. Oxford Logic Guides, No. 24. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994, xxiv + 229 pp. {{ISBN|0-19-504472-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some areas of [[theory of justification|epistemology]] and [[existence of god|theology]], the notion of [[Theory of justification|justification]] plays approximately the role of proof,&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-foundational/&lt;/ref&gt; while in [[jurisprudence]] the corresponding term is [[evidence (law)|evidence]],&lt;ref&gt;
http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/proof
&lt;/ref&gt;
with "burden of proof" as a concept common to both [[philosophic burden of proof|philosophy]] and [[legal burden of proof|law]].

==On proof==
In most disciplines, evidence is required to prove something. Evidence is drawn from experience of the world around us, with [[science]] obtaining its evidence from [[nature (science)|nature]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/public/pdf.nsf/lookup/sciman00.pdf/$file/sciman00.pdf Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence], 2nd Ed. (2000), p. 71. Accessed May 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; law obtaining its evidence from [[witness]]es and [[forensics|forensic investigation]],&lt;ref&gt;[[John Henry Wigmore]], ''A Treatise on the System of  Evidence in Trials at Common Law,'' 2nd ed., Little, Brown, and Co., Boston, 1915&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.   A notable exception is mathematics, whose proofs are drawn from a mathematical world begun with axioms and further developed and enriched by theorems proved earlier.

Exactly what evidence is sufficient to prove something is also strongly area-dependent, usually with no absolute threshold of sufficiency at which evidence becomes proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3052837 |author1=Simon, Rita James |author2=Mahan, Linda.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1971 | title = Quantifying Burdens of Proof—A View from the Bench, the Jury, and the Classroom| journal = Law and Society Review | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 319–330 | jstor = 3052837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valpo.edu/mcs/pdf/ReasonableDoubtFinal.pdf |format=PDF|title=Distributions of Interest for Quantifying Reasonable Doubt and Their Applications |accessdate=2007-01-14 |author1=Katie Evans |author2=David Osthus |author3=Ryan G. Spurrier }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/052185959X The Principle of Sufficient Reason: A Reassessment] by Alexander R. Pruss&lt;/ref&gt; In law, the same evidence that may convince one [[jury]] may not persuade another.  [[Formal proof]] provides the main exception, where the criteria for proofhood are ironclad and it is impermissible to defend any step in the reasoning as "obvious" (except for the necessary ability of the one proving and the one being proven to, to correctly identify any symbol used in the proof.);&lt;ref&gt;[[A. S. Troelstra]], H. Schwichtenberg (1996). ''Basic Proof Theory''.  In series ''Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-77911-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[well-formed formula]] to qualify as part of a formal proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus of some [[formal system]] to the previous well-formed formulae in the proof sequence.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Geoffrey, Metalogic: An Introduction to the Metatheory of Standard First-Order Logic, University of California Pres, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs have been presented since antiquity. [[Aristotle]] used the observation that patterns of nature never display the machine-like uniformity of [[determinism]] as proof that [[chance (Ancient Greek concept)|chance]] is an inherent part of nature.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle's Physics: a Guided Study'', Joe Sachs, 1995 {{ISBN|0813521920}} p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, [[Thomas Aquinas]] used the observation of the existence of [[law of nature (science)|rich patterns in nature]] as proof that nature is ''not'' ruled by chance.&lt;ref&gt;''The treatise on the divine nature: Summa theologiae I'', 1–13, by Saint Thomas Aquinas, Brian J. Shanley, 2006 {{ISBN|0872208052}} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Proofs need not be verbal.  Before [[Copernicus]], people took the apparent motion of the [[Sun]] across the sky as proof that [[geocentric model|the Sun went round the Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas S. Kuhn, The Copernican Revolution, pp. 5–20&lt;/ref&gt;  Suitably incriminating evidence left at the scene of a [[crime]] may serve as proof of the identity of the perpetrator.  Conversely, a verbal entity need not assert a proposition to constitute a proof of that proposition.  For example, a [[signature]] constitutes direct proof of [[authorship]]; less directly, [[handwriting analysis]] may be submitted as proof of authorship of a document.&lt;ref&gt;''Trial tactics by Stephen A. Saltzburg, 2007 {{ISBN|159031767X}} page 47&lt;/ref&gt;  [[secret|Privileged information]] in a document can serve as proof that the document's author had access to that information; such access might in turn establish the location of the author at certain time, which might then provide the author with an [[alibi]].

'''Santiago del Estero Quichua''' or '''Santiagueño Quechua''' (''Santiagen Quichua'') is a vulnerable dialect of [[Southern Quechua]] spoken by 60,000-100,000 people (estimates vary widely) in [[Argentina]]. It is spoken in [[Santiago del Estero Province|the province of Santiago del Estero]]. The estimated coordinates are 27°47′S 64°16′W.  Long-standing migration has also resulted in the presence of the language in other provinces of northeastern Argentina and in [[Buenos Aires]]. 

It is 81% similar to other [[Quechuan languages]]. There are radio programs in this languages and also a dictionary. There is some cultivation of the language as it is taught in some schools. It uses the [[Latin alphabet|Roman alphabet]]. Its speakers are Native Americans and they mostly work in agriculture. It is the seventh-most widely spoken language in Argentina behind [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Levantine Arabic]], [[South Bolivian Quechua]], Standard [[German language|German]], and [[Mapudungun]]. It is the third most widely spoken indigenous language.

There was once another dialect of Southern Quechua in Argentina, that of Catamarca and La Rioja, but it has [[Extinct language|gone extinct]]. All were introduced during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonial period]], as Quechua speakers were transplanted to various parts of the Spanish realm (continuing a practice of the Inca), and Quechua was an official language of Santiago, Catamarca, and La Rioja during the colonial era.

==Classification==
Quechuan, Peripheral Quechua, Chinchay

==People==
The indigenous people of Santiago del Estero were referred to as the "tonocoté". They faced much criticism from the rest of the Argentinian population which led to the diminishing of their language and culture as a whole. The government even went so far as to release flyers describing what these indigenous people looked like, including red skin and the use of feathers in their clothing. For this reason, they were singled out among the rest of the Hispanic population. Instead of learning their maternal language of Santiagueño Quechua at school, indigenous children were looked over and forced to learn the official Spanish language, which is a contributing factor as to why this language became endangered.

==Syntax==
The verb of movement "to go" has been extensively studied and compared to other dialects of Quechua.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez, G. D. (1997). Un fenómeno de convergencia lingüística por contacto en el quechua de Santiago del Estero: El desarrollo del futuro verbal perifrástico. Estudios Filológicos Estud. Filol., (32). Retrieved from http://red.pucp.edu.pe/ridei/wp-content/uploads/biblioteca/110503.doc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that while in other dialects, this verb is used to represent physical movement, in Santiagueño Quechua, it represents a future action. This can be compared to the modern Spanish phrase "ir a" which means "to go" + ''infinitive'' in Santiagueño Quechua.

===Pasado no experimentado===
It has been discovered that a new category of verb exists in this Quechua language: Pasado no experimentado, which adds a certain suffix to words to represent information that has been related to someone from another person. Usually, the suffix that corresponds to this is ''-ra''. Ex: "nia'''ra'''".

==Phonology==
There are five vowel phonemes primarily used in this language: {{IPA|/a, e, i, o, u/}}. In addition, as with other Quechuan languages, {{IPA|/a/}}, {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}} possess {{IPA|[ɑ]}}, {{IPA|[e ~ ɛ]}} and {{IPA|[o ~ ɔ]}} as allophones in the vicinity of the consonant phoneme {{IPA|/q/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Nardi, R. L. (1989). Aclaraciones sobre el quichua de santiago del estero. Relaciones De La Sociedad Argentina De Antropología; Tomo 17-2, 127-137. Retrieved from http://163.10.34.134/bitstream/handle/10915/25125/Documento_completo.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to other dialects of this language, which use the phoneme {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, Saniagueño Quechua possesses {{IPA|/ʒ ~ ʑ/}}, similar to the Argentinian Spanish pronunciation of {{IPA|/ʎ ~ ʝ/}} as {{IPA|[ʒ ~ ʑ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~saphon/en/|title=SAPhon – South American Phonological Inventories|website=linguistics.berkeley.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''segment''' of handwriting is a piece of the pen-tip [[trajectory]] between two defined segmentation points. If the occurrence of a minimum in the absolute (tangential) [[velocity]] is used as a heuristic for segmentation, the pen-tip [[trajectory]] can be subdivided into segments corresponding to [[ballistic stroke]]s.

In [[handwriting recognition]] or [[optical character recognition]], other terminologies may be used, such as the term [[glyph]] for a non-character (i.e.: sub character or 
multi-character) pattern.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8934">In [[number theory]], a '''Sierpinski''' or '''Sierpiński number''' is an odd [[natural number]] ''k'' such that &lt;math&gt;k \times 2^n  + 1 &lt;/math&gt; is [[composite number|composite]], for all natural numbers ''n''. In 1960, [[Wacław Sierpiński]] proved that there are [[Infinity|infinitely]] many odd [[integer]]s ''k'' which have this property.

In other words, when ''k'' is a Sierpiński number, all members of the following [[Set (mathematics)|set]] are composite:

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{\,k\cdot{}2^n + 1 : n \in\mathbb{N}\,\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Numbers in such a set with odd ''k'' and {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} are [[Proth number]]s.

==Known Sierpiński numbers==
The sequence of currently ''known'' Sierpiński numbers begins with:
: 78557, 271129, 271577, 322523, 327739, 482719, 575041, 603713, 903983, 934909, 965431, 1259779, 1290677, 1518781, 1624097, 1639459, 1777613, 2131043, 2131099, 2191531, 2510177, 2541601, 2576089, 2931767, 2931991, ... {{OEIS|id=A076336}}.

The number 78557 was proved to be a Sierpiński number by [[John Selfridge]] in 1962, who showed that all numbers of the form {{nowrap|78557⋅2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}} have a [[factorization|factor]] in the [[covering set]] {{math|{3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37, 73}}}. For another known Sierpiński number, 271129, the covering set is {{math|{3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 241}}}. Most currently known Sierpiński numbers possess similar covering sets.&lt;ref name="PG"&gt;[http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=SierpinskiNumber Sierpinski number at The Prime Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1995 A. S. Izotov showed that some fourth powers could be proved to be Sierpiński numbers without establishing a covering set for all values of ''n''. His proof depends on the [[aurifeuillean factorization]] {{math|1=''t''&lt;sup&gt;''4''&lt;/sup&gt;⋅2&lt;sup&gt;''4n+2''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 = (''t''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;⋅2&lt;sup&gt;''2n+1''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''t''⋅2&lt;sup&gt;''n+1''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)⋅(''t''&lt;sup&gt;''2''&lt;/sup&gt;⋅2&lt;sup&gt;''2n+1''&lt;/sup&gt; - ''t''⋅2&lt;sup&gt;''n+1''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1)}}. This establishes that all {{math|''n'' ≡ 2 (mod 4)}} give rise to a composite, and so it remains to eliminate only {{math|''n'' ≡ 0, 1, 3 (mod 4)}} using a covering set.&lt;ref name="FQ"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anatoly S. Izotov |url=http://www.fq.math.ca/Scanned/33-3/izotov.pdf |title=Note on Sierpinski Numbers |journal=Fibonacci Quarterly |volume=33 |issue=3 |year=1995 |page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sierpiński problem==

{{Further|Seventeen or Bust}}

{{unsolved|mathematics|Is 78,557 the smallest Sierpiński number?}}

The '''Sierpiński problem''' is: "What is the smallest Sierpiński number?"

In 1967, Sierpiński and Selfridge [[conjecture]]d that 78,557 is the smallest Sierpiński number, and thus the answer to the Sierpiński problem.

To show that 78,557 really is the smallest Sierpiński number, one must show that all the odd numbers smaller than 78,557 are ''not'' Sierpiński numbers.  That is, for every odd ''k'' below 78,557 there exists a positive integer ''n'' such that ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;+1 is prime.&lt;ref name="PG" /&gt; {{As of|2018|11}}, there are only five candidates:
: ''k'' = 21181, 22699, 24737, 55459, and 67607
which have not been eliminated as possible Sierpiński numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=1647 Seventeen or Bust] at [[PrimeGrid]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Sierpiński problem==

In 1976, Nathan Mendelsohn determined that the second provable Sierpiński number is the prime ''k = 271129''. The '''prime Sierpiński problem''' asks "what is the smallest prime Sierpiński number", and there is an ongoing "Prime Sierpiński search" which tries to prove that ''271129'' is the first Sierpiński number which is also a prime. The prime values of ''k'' less than ''271129'' for which a prime of the form ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;+1 is not known {{As of|2018|11}} are:
: ''k'' = 22699, 67607, 79309, 79817, 152267, 156511, 222113, 225931, 237019.
The first two, being less than 78557, are also unsolved cases of the (non-prime) Sierpiński problem described above.

==Extended Sierpiński problem==

Suppose that both preceding Sierpiński problems had finally been solved, showing that 78557 is the smallest Sierpiński number and that 271129 is the smallest prime Sierpiński number. This still leaves unsolved the question of the ''second'' Sierpinski number; there could exist a composite Sierpiński number ''k'' such that &lt;math&gt;78557 &lt; k &lt; 271129&lt;/math&gt;. A ongoing search is trying to prove that 271129 is the second Sierpiński number, by testing all ''k'' values between 78557 and 271129, prime or not.

Solving the extended Sierpiński problem, the most demanding of the three posed problems, requires the elimination of 23 remaining candidates &lt;math&gt;k &lt; 271129&lt;/math&gt;, of which nine are prime (see above) and fourteen are composite. The latter include ''k'' = 21181, 24737, 55459 from the original Sierpiński problem, unique to the extended Sierpiński problem. {{as of|2018|04}}, the following ten values of ''k'' remain:

: ''k'' = 91549, 99739, 131179, 163187, 200749, 202705, 209611, 227723, 229673, 238411.

The distributed volunteer computing project [[PrimeGrid]] is attempting to eliminate all the remaining values of ''k''. {{as of|2018|04}}, no prime has been found for these values of ''k'' with &lt;math&gt;n &lt; 11\,313\,676&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.primegrid.com/stats_esp_llr.php|title=Extended Sierpinski Problem statistics|website=www.primegrid.com|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent elimination was in April 2018, when &lt;math&gt;193997\times2^{11452891}+1&lt;/math&gt; was found to be prime by PrimeGrid, eliminating k=193997. The number is 3,447,670 digits long.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.primegrid.com/forum_thread.php?id=7981|title=ESP Mega Prime!|last=Zimmerman|first=Van|date=5 April 2018|website=www.primegrid.com|access-date=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simultaneously Sierpiński and Riesel==
A number may be simultaneously Sierpiński and [[Riesel number|Riesel]]. These are called Brier numbers. The smallest five known examples are 3316923598096294713661, 10439679896374780276373, 11615103277955704975673, 12607110588854501953787, 17855036657007596110949, ... ({{OEIS link|A076335}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primepuzzles.net/problems/prob_029.htm Problem 29.- Brier Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual Sierpinski problem==
If we take the ''n'' of ''k''2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 1 to a negative integer, then the number become &lt;math&gt;\frac{2^{-n}+k}{2^{-n}}&lt;/math&gt;. If we choose the numerator, then the number become 2&lt;sup&gt;−''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''k''. Thus, a '''dual Sierpinski number''' is defined as '''an odd natural number ''k'' such that {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''k''}} is composite for all natural numbers ''n'''''. There is a conjecture that the set of these numbers is the same as the set of Sierpinski numbers; for example, {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + 78557}} is composite for all natural numbers ''n''.

The least ''n'' such that {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''k''}} is prime are (for odd ''k''s)
:1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 8, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7, 2, 1, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 7, 4, 5, 3, 4, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1, 1, 10, 3, 3, 2, 1, 1, ... {{OEIS|id=A067760}}

The odd ''k''s which {{nowrap|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; + ''k''}} are composite for all {{nowrap|''n'' &lt; ''k''}} are
:773, 2131, 2491, 4471, 5101, 7013, 8543, 10711, 14717, 17659, 19081, 19249, 20273, 21661, 22193, 26213, 28433, ... {{OEIS|id=A033919}}

There is also a "five or bust", similar to seventeen or bust, considers this problem, and found (probable) primes for all {{nowrap|''k'' &lt; 78557}} (the largest prime is 2&lt;sup&gt;9092392&lt;/sup&gt; + 40291&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primenumbers.net/prptop/searchform.php?form=2%5En%2B40291&amp;action=Search PRP tops, search for 2^n+40291]&lt;/ref&gt;), so it is currently known that 78557 is the smallest dual Sierpinski number.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21157">In [[sociolinguistics]], a '''sociolect''' or '''social dialect''' is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of language]] (a [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]]) used by a socioeconomic class, a profession, an age group or other social group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Wolfram |first=Walt |chapter=Social varieties of American English |title=Language in the USA: Themes for the Twenty-first Century |editor=E. Finegan and J.R. Rickford |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-521-77747-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociolects involve both passive acquisition of particular communicative practices through association with a local community, as well as active learning and choice among speech or writing forms to demonstrate [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with particular groups.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Durrell.  Sociolect.  In: Sociolinguistics. An International Handbook of the Science of Language and Society. Edited by Ulrich Ammon, et al.  Walter de Gruyter, 2004, pp. 200–205&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who study sociolects are called sociolinguists. Sociolinguists study language variation. Sociolinguists define a sociolect by examining the social distribution of specific linguistic terms. For example, a sociolinguist would examine the use of the second person pronoun "you" for its use within the population. If one distinct social group used 'yous' as the plural form of the pronoun then this could indicate the existence of a sociolect. A sociolect is distinct from a [[dialect]] because [[social class]] rather than geographical subdivision substantiates the unique linguistic features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Eifring |first=Halvor |chapter=7 Language and Variation |title=Linguistics for Students of Asian and African Languages|url=http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/ikos/EXFAC03-AAS/h05/larestoff/linguistics/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A sociolect, defined by Peter Trudgill, a leading sociolinguist and [[philosopher]], is "a variety or lect which is thought of as being related to its speakers' social background rather than geographical background".&lt;ref name=Trudgill&gt;Trudgill, Peter. A Glossary of Sociolinguistics. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122}} This idea of sociolect began with the commencement of [[dialectology]], the study of different [[dialect]]s in relation to social society, which has been established in countries such as England for many years, but only recently has the field garnered more attention.&lt;ref name=Halliday&gt;Halliday, M. Language and Society. London;  New York: Continuum, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} However, as opposed to a dialect, the basic concept of a sociolect is that a person speaks in accordance with their social group whether it is with regard to one's ethnicity, age, gender, etc. As William Labov once said, "the sociolinguistic view…is that we are programmed to learn to speak in ways that fit the general pattern of our communities".&lt;ref name=Labov&gt;Labov, William. Dialect Diversity in America : the Politics of Language Change. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Therefore, what we are surrounded with in unison with our environment determines how we speak; hence, our actions and associations.

==Distinguished from dialect==
The main distinction between a sociolect and a dialect, which are continually confused, is the settings in which it is created. A dialect's main identifier is geography: a certain region uses specific phonological, morphosyntactic or lexical rules.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|35}} Asif Agha expands the concept by stating that "the case where the demographic dimension marked by speech are matters of geographic provenance along, such as speaker's birth locale, extended residence and the like".&lt;ref name=Agha&gt;Agha, Asif. Language and Social Relations. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007. 135. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}} However, a sociolect's main identifier is a socioeconomic class, age, gender, and ethnicity in a certain speech community.

An example of a dialectal difference, based on region, is the use of the words soda or pop and coke in different parts of the United States. As Thomas E. Murray states, "coke is used generically by thousands of people, especially in the southern half of the country."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Thomas E.. "From Trade Name to Generic: The Case of Coke." Trans. Array Names: A Journal of Onomastics. Maney Publishing, 1995. 165-86. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, pop is known to be a term that is used by many citizens in the northern half of the country.

An example of a sociolect difference, based on social grouping, is the [[zero copula]] in [[African American Vernacular English]]. It occurs in a specific ethnic group but in all areas of the United States.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|48}} [[William Labov]] gives an example: "he here" instead of "he's here".&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|38}}

==Definitions==

'''[[Code switching]]''' is "the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation".&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|23}}

'''[[Diglossia]]''', associated with the American linguist [[Charles A. Ferguson]], which describes a sociolinguistic situation such as those that obtain in Arabic-speaking countries and in German-speaking Switzerland. In such a diglossic community, the prestigious standard of 'High'(or H) variety, which is linguistically related to but significantly different from the vernacular or 'Low' (or L) varieties, has no native speakers.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|389}}

'''Domain''' is "different language, dialects, or styles are used in different social contexts".&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|41}}

'''Language attitudes''' are "social in origin, but that they may have important effects on language behavior, being involved in acts of identity, and on linguistic change."&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|73}}

'''[[Linguistic variable]]''' is "a linguistic unit…initially developed...in order to be able to handle linguistics variation. Variables may be lexical and grammatical, but are most often phonological". Example of British English (h) which is sometimes present and sometimes not.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|83}}

'''[[Pragmatics]]''' is the meaning of a word in social context, while [[semantics]] has "purely linguistic meaning".&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|107}}

'''Register''' is "a language variety that is associated with a particular topic, subject, or activity...." Usually, it is defined by vocabulary, but has grammatical features as well.&lt;ref name=Trudgill/&gt;{{rp|110}}

== Examples ==

===Tamil caste system===

Example 1

The following is an example of the lexical distinction between the Mudaliyar and the Iyengar groups of the Tamil-speaking caste in India. The Iyengar group is part of the Brahmin caste which is scholarly and higher in the caste hierarchy than the non-Brahmin or Mudaliyar, caste.&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|136}} The Mudaliyars use many of the same words for things that are differentiated within the Iyengars' speech. For example, as you can see below, the difference between drinking water, water in general, and non-potable water is used by one word in the non-Brahmin caste and three separate words in the Brahmin caste.  Furthermore, Agha references how the use of different speech reflects a "departure from a group-internal norm".&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|139}} For example, if the non-Brahmin caste uses Brahmin terms in their mode of speech it is seen as self-raising, whereas if people within the Brahmin caste use non-Brahmin speech it is seen as pejoratives.&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|138}} Therefore, depending on which castes use certain words the pragmatics change. Hence, this speech system is determined by socioeconomic class and social context.

===Norwegian socioeconomic sociolect===

Example 2

In the following example, we see the difference between the national standard and the colloquial speech found in Norway where the phonology and pronunciation differ. As Agha states, "Some lexical contrasts are due to the phonological difference (e.g., R makes more consonantal and vocalic distinctions than B), while others are due to the morphological difference (e.g., difference in plural suffixes and certain verb inflections) between two varieties.&lt;ref name=Agha/&gt;{{rp|140}}

=== Diglossia ===

Example 3

The chart below gives an example of diglossia in Arab-speaking nations and where it is used. Diglossia is defined by Mesthrie as "[a] situation where two varieties of a language exist side by side".&lt;ref name=Mesthrie&gt;Mesthrie, Rajend. Introducing Sociolinguistics. 2nd ed. Philadelphia: John Benjamins Pub., 2009. 38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The Classical Arabic is known as [[Modern Standard Arabic|الفصحى, or al-fuṣḥā]], while the colloquial dialect depends on the country. For example, [[Levantine Arabic|شامي, or šāmi]], is spoken in Lebanon and parts of Syria. In many situations, there is a major lexical difference among words in the classical and colloquial speech, as well as pronunciation differences, such as a difference in short vowels, when the words are the same. Although a specific example of diglossia was not given, its social context is almost if not more important. For example, Halliday tells us that "in areas with Diglossia, the link between language and success is apparent as the higher, classical register is learned through formal education".&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|175}}

===African American Vernacular English (AAVE)===

Example 4

Below is an example of the addition of the verbal -s not just on 3rd person singular verbs in the present tense like in SAE, but added onto infinitives, first-person present verbs, and 3rd person past perfect verbs.&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

# He can goes out.
# I don't know how to gets no girls.
# He'd knows that.

Further examples of the phenomenon in AAVE are provided below.

Below are examples of the lack of the possessive ending -s is usually absent in AAVE but contains a rule
As Labov shows states, "[the] use -s to indicate possession by a single noun or pronoun, but never between the possessor and the possessed."&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

"This is hers, This is mines, This is John's, but not in her book, my book, John book"&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

"Interview with Bryan A., seven years old, a struggling reader in a West Philadelphia elementary school: 
# If I don't get out my mom room, I get in trouble and when I don't get out my sister room she hit me.
# Bernicia penpal gave me one.
# That's what he did to my cousin Raymond dog at my cousin house.
# I was acting like I stole my sister food.
# At the museum, it was fun, we went in somebody heart."&lt;ref name=Labov/&gt;{{rp|49}}

==Effects==

===Code-switching===

Many times within communities that contain sociolects that separate groups linguistically it is necessary to have a process where the independent speech communities can communicate in the same register; even if the change is as simple as different pronunciation. Therefore, the act of codeswitching becomes essential. Codeswitching is defined as "the process whereby bilingual or bidialectal speakers switch back and forth between one language or dialect and another within the same conversation".&lt;ref name="Trudgill 1983"&gt;Trudgill, Peter. On Dialect : Social and Geographical Perspectives. New York: New York University Press, 1983. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23}} At times codeswitching can be situational, depending on the situation or topical, depending on the topic. Halliday terms this the best when he defines the role of discourse stating that "it is this that determines, or rather correlates with, the role played by the language activity in the situation".&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|20}} Therefore, meaning that which register is used depends on the situation and lays out the social context of the situation, because if the wrong register is used, then the wrong context is placed on the words. Furthermore, referring back to the diglossia expressed in the Arab-speaking world and the Tamil caste system in India, which words are used must be appropriate to not only the social class of the speaker, but the situation, the topic, and the need for courtesy. A more comprehensive definition is stated, "Code-switching is not only a definition of the situation but an expression of social hierarchy."&lt;ref name=Halliday/&gt;{{rp|137}}

For examples of the use of speech within certain situation refer back to the chart on Classical and Colloquial Arabic.

For examples of dialect selection based on topic, refer below:

When Albania was created in 1912, the educational rights of the Greek communities in Albanian territory were granted by the Protocol of Corfu (1914) and with the statement of Albania's representatives in the League of Nations (1921). However, under a policy of assimilation, the Greek schools (there were over 360 until 1913) were gradually forced to close and Greek education was virtually eliminated by 1934. Following the intervention by the League of Nations, a limited number of schools, only those inside the "official minority zones", were reopened.&lt;ref&gt;King, Russell; Mai, Nicola; Schwandner-Sievers, Stephanie (2005). The New Albanian Migration. Sussex Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-903900-78-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greece of Tomorrow. George H. Chase. READ BOOKS, 2007. {{ISBN|1-4067-0758-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ethnic Greeks living outside those areas were not counted as such. This has had a practical effect in the area of education: With the exception of the officially recognized Greek minority zones, where teaching was held in both the Greek and Albanian languages, in all other areas of Albania lessons were taught only in the Albanian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/refworldcountry,,,,ALB,4562d8b62,4938ef322,0.html Advisory Committee on the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities: Second Opinion on Albania], 29 May 2008. Council of Europe: Secretariat of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities.&lt;/ref&gt;If a few Albanian families moved into a town or village, the minority's right to be educated in Greek and publish in Greek newspapers was revoked.&lt;ref&gt;Vance, Charles; Paik, Yongsun (2006). Managing a Global Workforce Challenges and Opportunities in International Human Resource Management. M.E. Sharpe. p. 682. {{ISBN|978-0-7656-2016-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;In accordance with the communist Albanian policy of unification and homogenization, the use of the Greek language in Himarë was forbidden in public, and many Greek-speaking people were forced to move to places in northern or central Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=111}}.&lt;/ref&gt;As a consequence, Greek schools in the Himarë area were closed, and the local communities stuck to their language, which slowly became archaic when they started to emigrate to Greece (1991) in the aftermath of the communist regime's collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bon|2008a|p=60}}; {{harvnb|Bon|2008b|pp=7–29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Trudgill defines it, the Arvanikita is "the name given in Greece given to the language of the indigenous Albanian-speaking linguistic minority in that country".&lt;ref name="Trudgill 1983"/&gt;{{rp|10}} This community is different linguistically than the surrounding area and must use their language accordingly. For example, nowadays, Arvanitika is only used at home and other situations, such as in school during games, on the playground, or for "chatting up girls", while only Greek is spoken in class.&lt;ref name=Garrett&gt;Garrett, Peter. Investigating Language Attitudes: Social Meanings of Dialect, Ethnicity and Performance. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|129}} 

Therefore, it is both topical and situational in context.

===Discrimination===

Human rights in Albania are violated by the Government which have targeted the Greek-speaking population via police and secret service according to Human Rights organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/summaries/s.albania952.html|title=Albania: The Greek Minority|website=Hrw.org|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;According to Amnesty International there were cases of mistreatment of members of the Greek-speaking minority by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur11/004/1995/en/ ALBANIA: FAILURE TO END POLICE ILL-TREATMENT AND DEATHS IN CUSTODY]&lt;/ref&gt;Also, the Greek-speaking minority complained about the government’s unwillingness to recognize Greek-speaking towns outside communist-era “minority zones,” to utilize Greek in official documents and on public signs in Greek-speaking areas, or to include more ethnic Greeks in public administration.&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2008"&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119064.htm ALBANIA 2008 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2009"&gt;https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2009/eur/136016.htm ALBANIA 2009 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2010"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/eur/154409.htm ALBANIA 2010 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2011"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2011-Human-Rights-Report.pdf ALBANIA 2011 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2012"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2012-Human-Rights-Report-Albania.pdf ALBANIA 2012 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2013"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2013-Human-Rights-Report-Albania.pdf ALBANIA 2013 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2014"&gt;[https://al.usembassy.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/140/2016/10/2014-Human-Rights-Report-Albania.pdf ALBANIA 2014 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2015"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/253027.pdf ALBANIA 2015 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2016"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/265600.pdf ALBANIA 2016 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT]&lt;/ref&gt;
Albanian sources often use the pejorative term 'filogrek' (pro-Greek) in relation to Greeks-speaking minority groups, usually in a context disputing their Greek ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;King, Russell; Mai, Nicola; Schwandner-Sievers, Stephanie (2005). 
The New Albanian Migration. Sussex Academic Press. {{ISBN|978-1-903900-78-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;The 2012 USA annual report mention that the emergence of strident nationalist groups like the [[Red and Black Alliance]] (RBA) increased ethnic tensions with the Greek-speaking minority groups.&lt;ref name="US_Department_of_State_2012" /&gt;

The Arvanitika community also suffers from discrimination because they are cast under stereotypes by the use of their native language. As Garrett writes, "a number of Arvanites had suffered from what they regarded as discrimination, particularly during military service, and at school".&lt;ref name=Garrett/&gt;{{rp|130}} Even though, the language is the only thing that differentiates them from the surrounding Greeks, it still defines them as a distinct class and places them within a social hierarchy. 

Furthermore, within societies that maintain a diglossic state, the High ('H') and Low ('L') forms serve as a basis for discrimination. As Mesthrie writes, "Since the H form is learned via formal education, diglossia can be a means of excluding people from access to full participation in society".&lt;ref name=Mesthrie/&gt;

'''Southern''' or '''South Sami''' ({{lang|sma|åarjelsaemien gïele}}) is the southwestern-most of the [[Sami languages]]. It is a seriously endangered language; the strongholds of this language are the municipalities of [[Snåsa]], [[Røyrvik]], [[Røros]] and [[Hattfjelldal]] in [[Norway]].

==Writing system==

Southern Sami is one of the six [[Sami languages]] that has an official written language, but only a few books have been published for the language, one of which is an adequate-sized Southern Sami–Norwegian dictionary.

Southern Sami uses the [[Latin alphabet]]:

The Sami Language Council recommended in 1976 to use ⟨æ⟩ and ⟨ö⟩, but in practice the latter is replaced by ⟨ø⟩ in Norway and the former by ⟨ä⟩ in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magga |first1=Ole Henrik |last2=Magga |first2=Lajla Mattsson |date=2012 |title=Sørsamisk grammatikk |trans-title=A Grammar of South Sami |language=Norwegian |location=Kautokeino |publisher=Davvi Girji |page=12 |isbn=978-82-7374-855-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in accordance with the usage in [[Danish and Norwegian alphabet|Norwegian]] and [[Swedish alphabet|Swedish]], based on computer or typewriter availability. The Ï ï represents a back version of I i, however many texts fail to distinguish between the two.

C c, Q q, W w, X x, Z z are only used in words of foreign origin.

==Phonology==

Southern Sami has two dialects, the northern and the southern dialect. The phonological differences between the dialects are relatively small; the phonemic system of the northern dialect is explained below.

===Vowels===

The vowel phonemes of the northern dialect are the following; orthographic counterparts are given in italics:

==Grammar==

=== Sound alternations ===

In Southern Sami, the vowel in the second syllable of a word causes changes to the vowel in the first syllable, a feature called [[I-mutation|umlaut]]. The vowel in the second syllable can change depending on the inflectional ending being attached, and the vowel in the first vowel will likewise alternate accordingly. Often there are three different vowels that alternate with each other in the paradigm of a single word, for example as follows:

* ''ae'' ~ ''aa'' ~ ''ee'': ''vaedtsedh'' 'to walk' : ''vaadtsam'' 'I walk' : ''veedtsim'' 'I walked'
* ''ue'' ~ ''ua'' ~ ''øø'': ''vuelkedh'' 'to leave' : ''vualkam'' 'I leave' : ''vøølkim'' 'I left'

The following table gives a full overview of the alternations:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Proto-Samic&lt;br/&gt;first vowel
! Followed by&lt;br/&gt;*ā
! Followed by&lt;br/&gt;*ē
! Followed by&lt;br/&gt;*ō
! Followed by&lt;br/&gt;*ë
! Followed by&lt;br/&gt;*i
|-

| å
| u
| å, a
| o, a, ov
| u
|-
! *u
| å, a
| u
| å
| o, ov
| u
|}

On the other hand, Southern Sami is the only Sami language that does not have [[consonant gradation]]. Hence consonants in the middle of words never alternate in Southern Sami, even though such alternations are frequent in other Sami languages. Compare, for instance, Southern Sami ''nomme'' 'name' : ''nommesne'' 'in the name' to [[Northern Sami]] ''namma'' : ''namas'', with the consonant gradation ''mm'' : ''m''.

=== Cases ===

Southern Sami has 8 [[Grammatical case|cases]]:

===Verbs===

====Person====

Southern Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for three [[grammatical person]]s:

*first person
*second person
*third person

====Mood ====

====Tense====

====Grammatical number====

Southern Sami [[verb]]s conjugate for three [[grammatical number]]s:

*[[Grammatical number|singular]]
*[[Dual grammatical number|dual]]
*[[plural]]

====Negative verb====

Southern Sami, like Finnish, the other Sami languages and Estonian, has a [[negative verb]]. In Southern Sami, the negative verb conjugates according to [[Grammatical tense|tense]] (past and non-past), [[Grammatical mood|mood]] (indicative and imperative), [[Grammatical person|person]] (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular, dual and plural). This differs from some other [[Sami languages]], e.g. from [[Northern Sami]], which do not conjugate according to [[Grammatical tense|tense]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2013">'''Timerio''' is a [[constructed language]] based on numbers. It was presented to public in 1921 by the [[Berlin]] architect Tiemer as a pure literary language and should be used for [[automated translation]]s.&lt;ref name="One language"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Pei |first1=Mario |title=One Language for the World |publisher=Biblo &amp; Tannen Publishers |year=1958 | page=145 f. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6hV0zzsyxzUC&amp;pg=PA145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was, that every concept is assigned by a number. The language shows similarities to the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] by [[Melvil Dewey]].

One of the only known sentences is the number-combination ''1-80-17'', which means ''I love you''.&lt;ref name="Sino-Platonic Papers"&gt;{{Citation |editor=Victor H. Mair  |title=Reviews (II) |series=Sino-Platonic Papers |publisher=University of Pennsylvania |year=1989 | page=41 |url=http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp014_chinese_book_reviews.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here the 1 stands for ''I'', 17 for ''You'' and 80 for ''Love''. Alternatively, ''2'' can also be used as a description of ''you'' according to some forms. Thus, the number-combination would read ''1-80-2''. Given the basic concept that ''1'' equals ''I'', and that the designation starts from that viewpoint onwards, it is a logical alternative to accept ''2'' as another term for ''you''.

The comparative is shown by *, the superlative by ***. "And" is represented by +. A prefix of &gt; makes a root an adjective. The genitive takes the suffix II, the dative takes III. “1-3̅0̅-(3)-9802” means, “I’ll write three letters”. “6215-8_0-164-&gt;1673-980&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;” means, “The father loved the big coloured letters.”
Tenses were shown with an underscore below the number (past) or a macron above (future). The plural took superscript &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Numbers when expressed in a numerical form appeared inside brackets.

[[File:Laughing_gull_Porthmadog.jpg|thumb|right|[[Laughing gull]], a species of the Americas, photographed in [[Wales]].]]
'''Vagrancy''' is a phenomenon in [[biology]] whereby individual animals appear well outside their normal [[range (biology)|range]]; individual animals which exhibit vagrancy are known as '''vagrants'''. The term '''accidental''' is sometimes also used. There are a number of factors which might cause an individual to become a vagrant—genetic factors and weather conditions are two—but the causes are overall poorly understood. Vagrancy can be a precursor to [[colonisation (biology)|colonisation]] if individuals survive.

Vagrancy is known to occur in a wide range of animals such as [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s, [[mammal]]s and [[sea turtle]]s.

== In birds ==
{{See also|Bird migration#Vagrancy}}
[[File:Great Shearwater specimen (as discovered), Sleeping Bear Dunes NL, September 9, 2012 (7969969606).jpg|thumb|Vagrant birds in unfamiliar habitats may end up dying from stress or a lack of food, as happened to this [[great shearwater]] that was found at [[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore]] on [[Lake Michigan]]]]
In the Northern Hemisphere, adult birds (possibly inexperienced younger adults) of many species are known to continue past their normal breeding range during their spring migration and end up in areas further north (such birds are termed '''spring overshoots''').

In autumn, some young birds, instead of heading to their usual wintering grounds, take "incorrect" courses and migrate through areas which are not on their normal migration path. For example, Siberian [[passerine]]s which normally winter in [[Southeast Asia]] are commonly found in [[Northwest Europe]], e.g. [[Arctic warbler]]s in Britain. This is [[Reverse migration (birds)|reverse migration]], where the birds migrate in the opposite direction to that expected (say, flying north-west instead of south-east). The causes of this are unknown, but genetic mutation or other anomalies relating to the bird's magnetic sensibilities is suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other birds are sent off course by storms, such as some North American birds blown across the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Birds can also be blown out to sea, become physically exhausted, land on a ship and end up being carried to the ship's destination.

While many vagrant birds do not survive, if sufficient numbers wander to a new area they can establish new populations. Many isolated oceanic islands are home to species that are descended from landbirds blown out to sea, [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s and [[Darwin's finches]] being prominent examples.

== In insects ==
Vagrancy in insects is recorded from many groups—it is particularly well-studied in [[butterflies]] and [[moths]], and [[dragonflies]].

== In mammals ==
In mammals, vagrancy has been recorded for bats, pinniped seals, whales and manatees.

== In reptiles ==
Vagrancy has been recorded for [[sea turtle]]s, snakes (e.g. ''[[Pelamis platura]]''), crocodilians, and probably also occurs in lizards. It therefore seems to be a fairly widespread phenomenon in reptiles. Saltwater crocodiles are especially prone to vagrancy, with individuals occasionally being recorded in odd places including [[Fiji]], [[Iwo Jima]], and even the [[Sea of Japan]].

== Alternative uses in botany ==
The term vagrant is also used of plants (e.g. Gleason and Cronquist, 1991), to refer to a plant that is growing far away from its species' usual range (especially north of its range) with the connotation of being a temporary population. In the context of lichens, a vagrant form or species occurs unattached to a substrate ("loose"), not necessarily outside its range.&lt;ref&gt;Rosentreter, R. &amp; McCune, B. 1992. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3243779 "Vagrant ''Dermatocarpon'' in Western North America"]. ''The Bryologist''. 95:15–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], an [[argument]] is '''valid''' if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the [[premise|premises]] to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true,&lt;ref&gt;Jc Beall and Greg Restall, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/logical-consequence/ "Logical Consequence"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion. A [[well-formed formula|formula]] is valid [[if and only if]] it is true under every [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], and an argument form (or schema) is valid if and only if every argument of that [[logical form]] is valid.

==Arguments==

An  [[argument]] is valid if and only if the truth of its premises [[Logical consequence|entails]] the truth of its conclusion and each step, sub-argument, or logical operation in the argument is valid.  Under such conditions it would be self-contradictory to affirm the premises and deny the conclusion.  The [[corresponding conditional]] of a valid argument is a [[logical truth]] and the negation of its corresponding conditional is a [[contradiction]]. The conclusion is a [[logical consequence]] of its premises.

An argument that is not valid is said to be "invalid".

An example of a valid argument is given by the following well-known [[syllogism]]:
: All men are mortal.
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

What makes this a valid argument is not that it has true premises and a true conclusion, but the logical necessity of the conclusion, given the two premises. The argument would be just as valid were the premises and conclusion false. The following argument is of the same [[logical form]] but with false premises and a false conclusion, and it is equally valid:

: All cups are green.
: Socrates is a cup.
: Therefore, Socrates is green.

No matter how the universe might be constructed, it could never be the case that these arguments should turn out to have simultaneously true premises but a false conclusion.  The above arguments may be contrasted with the following invalid one:

: All men are immortal.
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

In this case, the conclusion contradicts the deductive logic of the preceding premises, rather than deriving from it. Therefore, the argument is logically 'invalid', even though the conclusion could be considered 'true' in general terms. The premise 'All men are immortal' would likewise be deemed false outside of the framework of classical logic. However, within that system 'true' and 'false' essentially function more like mathematical states such as binary 1s and 0s than the philosophical concepts normally associated with those terms.

A standard view is that whether an argument is valid is a matter of the argument's [[logical form]].  Many techniques are employed by logicians to represent an argument's logical form.  A simple example, applied to two of the above illustrations, is the following:  Let the letters 'P', 'Q', and 'S' stand, respectively, for the set of men, the set of mortals, and Socrates.  Using these symbols, the first argument may be abbreviated as:

: All P are Q.
: S is a P.
: Therefore, S is a Q.

Similarly, the third argument becomes:

: All P are not Q.
: S is a P.
: Therefore, S is a Q.

An argument is termed formally valid if it has structural self-consistency, i.e. if when the operands between premises are all true, the derived conclusion is always also true. In the third example, the initial premises cannot logically result in the conclusion and is therefore categorized as an invalid argument.

==Valid formula==
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

A formula of a [[formal language]] is a valid formula if and only if it is true under every possible [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the language. In propositional logic, they are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

==Statements==
A statement can be called valid, i.e. logical truth, if it is true in all interpretations.

==Soundness==

Validity of deduction is not affected by the truth of the premise or the truth of the conclusion. The following deduction is perfectly valid:

: All animals live on Mars.
: All humans are animals.
: Therefore, all humans live on Mars.

The problem with the argument is that it is not ''[[soundness|sound]]''.  In order for a deductive argument to be sound, the deduction must be valid and '''all'''  the premises true.

==Satisfiability==
{{Main|Satisfiability}}

[[Model theory]] analyzes formulae with respect to particular classes of interpretation in suitable mathematical structures.  On this reading, formula is valid if all such interpretations make it true.  An inference is valid if all interpretations that validate the premises validate the conclusion.  This is known as ''semantic validity''.&lt;ref&gt;L. T. F. Gamut, ''Logic, Language, and Meaning: Introduction to Logic'', University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==

In '''truth-preserving''' validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true'.

In a '''false-preserving''' validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cogan, ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step'', University Press of America, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fit9rjXiLBUC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48].&lt;/ref&gt;
