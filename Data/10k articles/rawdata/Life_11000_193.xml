On 12 June 2014, three [[Israel]]i teenagers were kidnapped at the bus/[[Hitchhiking in Israel|hitchhiking stop]] at the [[Israeli settlement]] of [[Alon Shvut]] in [[Gush Etzion]], in the [[West Bank]], as they were [[hitchhiking]] to their homes.&lt;ref name="20140615CNN"/&gt; The three teens were Naftali Frenkel (16, from [[Nof Ayalon]]), Gilad Shaer (16, from [[Talmon]]), and Eyal Yifrah (19, from [[Elad]]).&lt;ref name="20160615haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.598583|title=Live Blog: Netanyahu says three teens kidnapped by terror organization |date=15 June 2014|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WP20140614"/&gt;

On 25 July, [[BBC News|BBC]] [[List of BBC newsreaders and reporters|correspondent Jon Donnison]] tweeted that Israeli police spokesman [[Mickey Rosenfeld]] stated that the kidnappings did not occur on the orders of, or with the knowledge of the Hamas leadership, and that the crime was the action of a "lone cell".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2014/Jul-26/265229-hamas-not-complicit-in-teens-kidnap-israeli-police.ashx "Hamas not complicit in teens’ kidnap: Israeli police"], ''[[The Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]'', 26 July 2014; "Israeli police spokes Mickey Rosenfeld also said if kidnapping had been ordered by Hamas leadership, they'd have known about it in advance."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katie Zavadski, [http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/07/hamas-didnt-kidnap-the-israeli-teens-after-all.html "It Turns Out Hamas May Not Have Kidnapped and Killed the 3 Israeli Teens After All"], ''[[New York (magazine)|New York Magazine]]'', 25 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Walker, Tom McCarthy [https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2014/jul/25/gaza-crisis-israel-strike-un-shelter-palestinian-protesters-west-bank-live-updates "Gaza crisis: Kerry says ceasefire deal remains out of reach"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 25 July 2014; [5:45 pm]: "'Israeli police MickeyRosenfeld tells me men who killed 3 Israeli teens def lone cell, hamas affiliated but not operating under leadership", Donnison tweets'&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buzzfeed|Sheera Frenkel]] had reported similar views from Israel and Palestinian sources some ten days earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[[Buzzfeed|Sheera Frenkel]], [https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/who-was-behind-the-kidnapping-of-three-israeli-teens-and-why "Who Was Behind The Kidnapping Of Three Israeli Teens, And Why Are They So Hard To Find?"], Buzzfeed, 15 Jun 2014; "The kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers was likely carried out by a small group of militants with no direct orders from Hamas, ISIS, or any other regional terror group, said senior Israeli and Palestinian officials Sunday ... For years, Israeli officials have warned that there was a rising threat from individuals carrying out terror attacks without the assistance of an organized group. Those attacks, they added, were harder to defend against as there was often no intelligence warning leading up to the attack. "What we do know, is that this was likely an opportunistic move. The men behind this may have ties to a larger terror group, but this does not have the markings of a well-planned, complex operation.".'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ungar-Sargon"/&gt; Rosenfeld later denied having used the words "lone cell".&lt;ref name="Ungar-Sargon" &gt;Batya Ungar-Sargon, [http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/180617/did-israel-say-hamas-didnt-kidnap-its-teens-no "Did Israel Say Hamas Didn’t Kidnap Its Teens?

On 5 August, Israel said that it had arrested Hussam Qawasmeh, a cousin of Marwan Qawasmeh, on 11 July, who is suspected of having organized the killing of the three teenagers. According to court documents, Qawasmeh stated that Hamas members in [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] financed the recruitment and arming of the killers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/palestinian-suspect-held-over-kidnap-murders-3-israelis-232132557.html|title=Palestinian suspect held over kidnap murders of 3 Israelis: police|publisher=Yahoo!

On 26 June, the [[Israel Security Agency]] released the identities of two Hamas suspects in the kidnapping.&lt;ref name="CNNIdentify"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/06/26/world/meast/israel-kidnapped-teenagers-hamas|title=Israeli authorities identify the suspects in teens' kidnapping|publisher=[[CNN]]|accessdate=29 June 2014|first1=Shelby Lin|last1=Erdman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ISA and Palestinian authorities said that the two men have been missing since the night of the kidnapping, and the ISA stated that both had engaged in terrorism, been arrested, and served time in the past, and were considered suspects immediately after the kidnapping.

On 20 August 2014, a [[Hamas]] official [[Saleh al-Arouri|Salah al-Arouri]], who had been publicly identified as the mastermind of the operation several days after the kidnapping, on 19 June,&lt;ref name="AHCL" /&gt; said that the organization's armed wing, the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], was behind the kidnapping and murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In first, Hamas official takes credit for kidnap and murder of Israeli teens|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/In-first-Hamas-official-takes-credit-for-kidnap-and-murder-of-Israeli-teens-371703|accessdate=20 August 2014|publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kais|first1=Roi|title=Hamas admits to kidnapping three Israeli teens|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4561387,00.html|accessdate=20 August 2014|publisher=YNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.611676|title=Hamas claims responsibility for three Israeli teens' kidnapping and murder|date=21 August 2014|work=Haaretz.com|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian hamas official"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/11048705/Hamas-kidnapped-three-teenagers-leading-figure-says.html Hamas kidnapped three teenagers, leading figure says] The Telegraph Retrieved 22 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas official admits group abducted, killed Israeli teens|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2014/08/21/hamas-official-admits-group-orchestrated-abductions-and-killings-israeli-teens/|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Shin Bet had been investigating him in the belief that he ran a major Hamas network in the West Bank,  headed by Riad Nasser of [[Deir Qadis]], near Ramallah, and that he was behind the kidnapping.

In their view it appears doubtful that any senior Hamas official would have been ready to accept that kind of risk.&lt;ref name="AHCL"/&gt;

On 23 September 2014, after Israel killed the two suspects, Marwan Qawasmeh and Amar Abu-Isa (aka Amer Abu Aysha) in a shootout, IDF Chief Lt. Gen. [[Benny Gantz]] announced that Operation Brother's Keeper "has come to an end."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Gantz-Operation-Brothers-Keeper-has-come-to-an-end-376127 "Gantz: Operation Brothers Keeper has come to an end"], ''The Jerusalem Post'', 23 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2015, Hussam Qawasmeh, a member of Hamas, was jailed and sentenced to three life terms in prison for the murders. He must also pay $63,000 in compensation to the victims' families.&lt;ref name=Hussam-Qawasme-jailed&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-30697521|title=Palestinian jailed for murder of Israeli teenagers|author=BBC|date=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2013 was a calm period with the November 2012 ceasefire being largely respected, despite 50 rockets fired by Palestinians and 10 airstrikes by Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/26E6B78156B58A9985257CB70065223F|title=Human Rights and Democracy Report 2013|date=10 April 2014|publisher=UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office|access-date=28 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510060215/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/26E6B78156B58A9985257CB70065223F|archive-date=10 May 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to PCHR 44 Palestinians were killed and over 100 injured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pchrgaza.org/files/2014/annual%20English%202013.pdf |title=PCHR Annual Report 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Israeli Security Agency reported  six Israeli fatalities (all but one from the West Bank) and 44 injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shabak.gov.il/English/EnTerrorData/Reports/Pages/2013AnnualSummary.aspx |title= 2013 Annual Summary | publisher=Israel Security Agency|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first half of 2014 saw an increase in tension manifested by a higher rate of injuries.

==Suspects==

===Initial suspected perpetrators===
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Hamas killed the teenagers.&lt;ref name="washington post found dead"/&gt; But opinions were divided within Israel's security services as to whether or not the two suspects had direct ties to Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;Sheera Frenkel, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/sheerafrenkel/three-kidnapped-israeli-teens-are-found-dead "Three Kidnapped Israeli Teens Are Found Dead"], ''[[BuzzFeed]]'', 30 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 June, the Israel Security Agency identified two Hamas members as key suspects in the kidnapping, whom Palestinian police noted, had gone missing since the night of the kidnapping.&lt;ref name="CNNIdentify"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|place=UK|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/10929615/Israel-identifies-two-suspects-in-case-of-kidnapped-teens.html|title=Israel identifies two suspects in case of kidnapped teens|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-ranking members of Hamas denied that the group had any involvement or foreknowledge of the incident.&lt;ref name="20140615TOI"/&gt; The two named suspects hail from the [[Qawasameh tribe|Qawasameh clan]], notorious for consistently acting against Hamas's policies and its attempts to reach an entente {{dubious|date=September 2016}} with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Shlomi Eldar, [https://web.archive.org/web/20140630191535/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/06/qawasmeh-clan-hebron-hamas-leadership-mahmoud-abbas.html "Accused kidnappers are actually rogue Hamas branch"], ''[[Al-Monitor]]'', 29 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas political chief [[Khaled Meshal]] said he could neither confirm nor deny the kidnapping of the three Israelis, and he congratulated the abductors, because "our prisoners must be freed from the prisons of the occupation".&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.600759#!|title=Hamas chief lauds abductors of Israeli teens, says has no new information|work=Haaretz|accessdate=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspects arrest===
After the kidnap of the Israeli teens, Israel commenced Operation Brother's Keeper in the West Bank. Israel killed 9 Palestinians and raided 1300 properties including commercial and residential buildings. 800 Palestinians were arrested without charge or trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mehdi-hasan/gaza-israel_b_5624401.html Debunking Israel's 11 Main Myths About Gaza, Hamas and War Crimes] Huffington Post Retrieved 23 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
On 5 August 2014 Israel announced that Israeli security forces arrested Hussam Kawasme, in [[Shuafat]], in connection with the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Middle-East/Kidnap-and-murder-of-Israeli-teens-Palestinian-suspect-held-police-say/articleshow/39719757.cms|title=Kidnap and murder of Israeli teens: Palestinian suspect held, police say|work=The Times of India|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During interrogation, Kawasme admitted to being the mastermind behind the attack, in addition to securing the funding from Hamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/world/2014/08/06/palestinian-suspect-held-kidnap-murders-3-israelis/|title=Palestinian suspect held over kidnap murders of 3 Israelis|work=The Rakyat Post|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kawasme stated that after the boys were killed, Marwan Kawasme and Amer Abu Aysha drove to his house, and they proceeded to bury them in Halhoul, the land Kawasme purchased only a few weeks prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-funded-kidnapping-of-3-boys-says-ringleader/|title=Hamas funded killing of 3 teens, says ringleader|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of his arrest, Kaswasme had shaved his beard and received a fake passport, in what is believed to be, part of a plan to escape to Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/183758#.U-J8xmJdXDg|title=Security Forces Arrest Kidnapper of Israeli Teens - Defense/Security - News  - Arutz Sheva|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials have stated that additional people arrested in connection with the murders are still being held, but no names have been released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-arrests-suspected-ringleader-of-cell-that-nabbed-teens/|title=Israel arrests suspected ringleader of cell that killed teens|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, Hamas member Saleh al-Arouri, who lives in Turkey, claimed Hamas' involvement in the abduction and murder, according to an Israeli channel 2 translation. He continued on calling the men who perpetrated the act heroic.&lt;ref name="memritv Arouri speech"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hamas Leadership Acknowledges Responsibility for Kidnapping Three Israeli Teens|url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/4437.htm|accessdate=21 August 2014|publisher=Memri T.V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Lovatt of the [[European Council on Foreign Relations]] said al-Arouri's claim was "suspicious": it might reflect a desire to assert his relevance within the Hamas leadership or it may be true, and reflect a power struggle within Hamas itself.&lt;ref name="guardian hamas official" /&gt; On 21 August Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]] claimed Hamas leadership had no prior knowledge of the abductions and murders and had learned about them through the Israeli military.&lt;ref name="Mashaal Yahoo interview" /&gt;

The following day, NGO [[Shurat HaDin]], contacted US Attorney General Eric Holder to request extradition of al-Arouri. Although Turkey and Israel do not have an extradition agreement, the US and Turkey do, which it can use to extradite those who commit terrorists acts against US citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/184277#.U_Yl32JdXDg|title=NGO Asks US to Demand Extradition of Hamas Leader|work=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suspects killings===
The two suspects Marwan Kawasme and Amar Abu Aysha were staying in a house in Hebron when IDF soldiers and Israeli counter-terrorism members, [[Yamam]], surrounded the building at dawn on 23 September in an attempt to arrest the suspects. Israeli forces opened fire on the building and reportedly called on the two suspects to come out. With no response the Israeli force began using a bulldozer to bring down the building. According to Israeli forces, they shot one of the men as his head rose out of a hole and began firing a rifle. After this man fell back into the home, likely dead, Israeli forces again opened fire on the house, utilizing grenades and other explosives this time, killing both men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4574284,00.html|title=Inside the raid on teens' killers|publisher=Ynet News|date=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/WATCH-Dramatic-footage-of-Israeli-SWAT-team-killing-Palestinian-murderers-of-three-Jewish-teens-376210|title=WATCH: Dramatic footage of Israeli SWAT team hunting Palestinian murderers of three Jewish teens|publisher=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hebron governor Kamel Hmeid and Hamas spokesman Salah Bardawil both called the suspects martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/23/us-palestinians-israel-idUSKCN0HI09H20140923|title=Israel says its troops kill Hamas men accused of slaying teens|work=Reuters|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israeli-forces-kill-2-suspects-in-kidnap-murder-of-3-teens/2014/09/23/1e79414a-4304-11e4-b47c-f5889e061e5f_story.html|title=Israeli forces kill two Hamas members suspected in kidnapping, killing of 3 teens|work=Washington Post|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas leader Khaled Mashal also called the suspects "martyrs" and "heroes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4583490,00.html|title='Mohammed Deif is alive, and we have proof,' says Mashal|work=ynet|accessdate=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigation conclusion===
The investigation concluded that the kidnapping operation's costs ran to [[New Israeli Shekel|NIS]]220,000, a sum procured by Hossam Hassan Kawasmeh (40), with the assistance of his brother, Mahmoud, who was exiled to the Gaza Strip in the Gilad Shalit exchange in November 2011, to purchase the two vehicles and weaponry. The cars were purchased from Nuh Abu-Eisha, the weapons from Hamas operative Adnan Mahmad Izzat Zru (34) both Hebronites. His attempt to escape to Jordan, thwarted when he was arrested in the Shuafat refugee camp on 11 July, was assisted by his relatives Hisham Kawasmeh (45), Jamil Kawasmeh (38) and Hassan Kawasmeh (45) a Hamas militant. Two other Hebronites, Ahmad Ibrahim Mahmad Kawasmeh (64) and his brother, senior Hamas operative Arafat Ibrahim Mahmad Kawasmeh (50) for assistance in going into hiding, and the latter concealed them on his property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4567528,00.html ‘Abduction of 3 Israeli teens cost NIS 220,000,'] [[Ynet]] 4 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
On 6 January 2015, Hussam Qawasmeh was sentenced to three life terms in prison for the murders as well as a compensation payment of $63,000 to the victims' families.&lt;ref name=Hussam-Qawasme-jailed /&gt;

==Sequence of events==

===Prelude===
According to Israeli investigations, the seizure and killing of the three was organized by Hussam Qawasmeh, who had received $39,000 from his brother Mahmoud in Gaza, via a go-between still at large. The money financed the purchase of three M-16 rifles, a jeep, and the Israeli car, which was bought from a used-car dealer in Hebron after it was stolen from the settlement of [[Tzur Hadassah]].&lt;ref name="AHCL" /&gt; Altogether, he met with Marwan five or six times before the kidnapping. The plan was to conceal one kidnapped Israeli in Marwan Qawasme's barbershop in Hebron, then transfer him to Marwan's aunt's vacant house. A first attempt on 10 June failed to find any hitchhikers.&lt;ref name="AHCL" /&gt; There was no intention to release the boys: from the outset the plan, considered amateurish and not professional, envisaged murdering the captives. The plot of land where they were buried had been purchased to that end some time earlier, and a refuge to escape detection had been prepared in an old house near Tufah where the two suspects hid in a disused cesspit for five days.&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Levinson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.612132 'Israeli teens’ kidnappers evaded army, hid in cesspool after murders,'] [[Haaretz]] 23 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The car for the kidnapping had been stolen.

===Week 1 (12–19 June)===

====Day 1====
Late into the night of Thursday, 12 June, teenagers Yifrach, Fraenkel, and Shaer were waiting at Geva'ot Intersection, west of the settlement of Alon Shvut in the Etzion Bloc south of Jerusalem, soon after 22:15, looking to catch a ride heading west on Route 367 toward Beit Shemesh and from there to locations in central Israel where each of them lived. The kidnappers intended to kidnap one Israeli. Apparently Yifrach, after accepting a ride, waved to the other two to join him. The Palestinians, afraid of giving their identity away if they spoke Hebrew, didn't dare object.&lt;ref name="AHCL" &gt;Amos Harel and Chaim Levinson, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.660854 'One year after West Bank murder-kidnapping: What Israeli security got wrong,'] [[Haaretz]] 12 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After the car veered off from the declared direction of Ashkelon, the three realized they had been kidnapped and Shaer telephoned the police at 22:25, whispering, "I've been kidnapped."&lt;ref name="AHCL" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/what-happened-on-the-night-of-the-kidnapping/#ixzz38tE0htQ0|title=What happened on the night of the kidnapping|work=The Times of Israel|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight attempts were made to page the caller's cellphone, without checking its ownership, and his whispered remark was taken to be one of the many pranks that night.  No check was made to find out the phone's owner, or whether he was missing.

On 30 June, a search team located the bound bodies of the three boys on land purchased recently by the [[Qawasameh tribe|Qawasmeh]] family&lt;ref name="Issacharoff2" /&gt; in an open field near Khirbet Aranava in the [[Nahal Telem|Wadi Tellem]] area, between Halhul and [[Karmei Tzur]], about {{convert|3|km|mi}} west of the former, just north of Hebron.&lt;ref name="bo3ktf"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen Ravid Khoury"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Gili |last1=Cohen |first2=Barak |last2=Ravid |first3=Jack |last3=Khoury |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.602189 |type=live updates |title=Israeli forces find bodies of three kidnapped teens |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4536378,00.html |title=IDF finds missing teens' bodies in West Bank |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high security source revealed that:

The ambulance carrying the three bodies was attacked by Palestinians as it left Halhul, the location where the bodies had been found.

====Day 19====
The joint funeral of Yifrach, Fraenkel, and Shaer was scheduled for 17:30 on 1 July. Huge crowds delayed it for over an hour.

Israeli jets and helicopters struck 34 locations in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip in response to more than 20 rockets being fired at Israel from Gaza. A 19-year-old Palestinian man, Yousouf Al-Zagha, was shot dead by Israeli troops during a raid in the northern town of Jenin. An IDF spokesperson said the man had thrown a grenade at the troops, while his family maintained he had been carrying eggs home for [[suhoor]], the predawn meal during the fast of Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Deitch |first=Ian |date=1 July 2014 |url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_PALESTINIANS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2014-07-01-04-25-41 |title=As Israel buries teens, airstrikes target Hamas |publisher=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Ori |date=1 July 2014 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/07/01/us-palestinians-israel-idUSKBN0F521P20140701 |title=Israel mourns teenagers, strikes Hamas in Gaza |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Day 20====
A Palestinian teenager was abducted from East Jerusalem and murdered. Israeli police located the body within hours, and arrested Israeli nationalist suspects several days later.&lt;ref name= "Suspects Arrested"&gt;{{cite news |title=Shin Bet forces arrest six in connection with Palestinian teens killing|url= http://www.israelnews.net/index.php/sid/223558111/scat/f81a4d9d561822ee/ht/Shin-Bet-forces-arrest-six-in-connection-with-Palestinian-teens-killing|accessdate=7 July 2014 |work=Israel News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[kidnapping and murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir]] was soundly denounced by all of the families of the Israeli kidnapping victims as well as by many Israeli governmental and non-governmental public figures.

===Week 4 and on (4 July and after)===
On 4 July, Israel stated it was searching for a third suspect, Husam Dofsh, absent from his home since the kidnapping. A relative, Jihad Dofsh, had blown himself up in a "work accident" in a Hamas explosives laboratory in Hebron, and one of Qawasmeh's relatives had died in the same incident.&lt;ref name="Issaster"&gt;{{cite news |first1=Avi |last1=Issacharoff |first2=Adiv |last2=Sterman |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/third-hamas-operative-reported-missing-since-teens-kidnapping/ |title=Israel hunting third Hamas operative missing since night teens were killed |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Husam Dofsh was arrested in a Hebron coffee-shop the following day, after phoning an Israeli news site to protest his innocence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Adiv |last=Sterman |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/suspected-accomplice-in-3-teens-killings-arrested/ |title=Suspected accomplice in 3 teens' killings arrested |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=6 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For about two weeks in July, Israeli military preparations began for direct fighting inside of Gaza, whilst Hamas rocket fire into Israel took place.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jcpa.org/the-gaza-war-2014/|title=The Gaza War 2014|newspaper=Jerusalem Center For Public Affairs|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military publicly announced on 17 July that it would go into Gaza, an intervention that caused at least 25 soldiers killed and scores injured on the Israeli side over the 20 to 21 July period.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Public opinion in the nation is strongly divided, with, for example, the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' editorializing that the "soft Gaza sand... could turn into quicksand" and warning about the "wholesale killing" of Palestinian civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/israeli-mood-turns-dark-mounting-casualties-24652707|title=International|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=23 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign in the Gaza is referred to by Israel as [[Operation Protective Edge]].

On 20 August, Hamas official Saleh Al-'Arouri spoke at the conference of the [[International Union of Muslim Scholars]] in [[Istanbul]], where he said the group's military wing was responsible for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens, saying it was an expression of popular will.&lt;ref&gt;Orlando Crowcroft [Hamas official: we were behind the kidnapping of three Israeli teenagers] [[The Guardian]] 21 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khaled Mashal]], the Hamas leader, while recognizing that Hamas members were responsible, attempted to distance his organization from the killing two days later. Stating Hamas's opposition to killing civilians, he said the leadership had no advance knowledge of the abduction, which he regarded as a legitimate act by a frustrated people living under occupation, and that it had only learnt of its details from Israeli investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.612039 Hamas: We wouldn't target civilians if we had better weapons,] [[Haaretz]] 23 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Following the kidnappings and the escalating firing of missiles by Palestinian militants towards civilians in southern Israel, Israel decides to embark on Operation Protective Edge. On 3 July 2014, the Israeli Air Force conducted 15 air strikes in Gaza directed at Hamas targets in response to a rocket attack from Palestinian militants. The previous night, fifteen Palestinians were injured in the IAF strikes and two buildings ruined&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;{{cite news |title= Live updates, July 2: Israel strikes Gaza; Sderot hit by rocket |newspaper=Haaretz |date =3 July 2014|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.602557|accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rt.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Buildings in ruins in Palestine after Israel's tit-for-tat airstrikes (photos, video) |publisher=RT|date=3 July 2014 |url=http://rt.com/news/170252-israel-palestinian-gaza-airstrikes/ |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Protective Edge]], became a ground war on 8 July 2014, and is believed to have been triggered by the kidnapping and continuous indiscriminate Palestinian rocket fire on Israeli civilians.

On 11 July 2014 it has been reported by the nonprofit news organization [[Washington Free Beacon]],&lt;ref name=WFB-5MioUS$-reward&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kredo|first1=Adam|title=Congress to Offer $5 Million for Info on Hamas Kidnappers|url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/congress-to-offer-5-million-for-info-on-hamas-kidnappers/|website=freebeacon.com|publisher=[[The Washington Free Beacon]]|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a series of bills in the [[United States Senate]] and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] was launched, attempting to solve the boys' murder, based on Yaakov Naftali Fraenkel's dual US-Israeli citizenship. The new legislation, if passed, would offer a $5 million reward for information on the abduction and murder.&lt;ref name=A7-5MioUS$-Reward&gt;US representative [[Doug Lamborn]] said "Naftali Frenkel was an American citizen who was killed by terrorists and the United States should not rest until his killers are brought to justice (..) amazingly, the Obama administration still supports this terrorist Palestinian government, even after the death of an American citizen" {{cite web|last1=Dvorin|first1=Tova|title=US Bill to Offer $5 Million Reward for Tips on Teens' Abduction|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/182786|website=israelnationalnews.com/News/|publisher=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accusations of collective punishment==
On Day 7, The Palestinian Authority declared that the Israeli [[modus operandi]], of clamping down on towns with closures and continual arrest of Hamas members, constituted [[collective punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Marissa |last=Newsman |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/pa-accuses-israel-of-collective-punishment-in-west-bank/ |title=PA accuses Israel of 'collective punishment' in West Bank |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oren"/&gt; [[Amnesty International]] issued a statement on 19 June calling both for the release of the Israeli youths, their humane treatment while being held, and for Israel to lift several measures it defined as collective punishment in violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] and [[customary international humanitarian law]].&lt;ref name="AI" /&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "The Israeli security forces closed off the area around Hebron. Some 23,000 local Palestinians were barred from travelling to their jobs in Israel. A series of charitable organisations that used to be run by Hamas were closed down and a dairy, which employs hundreds of Palestinians, was demolished. Hebronites were prevented from travelling abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21606288-murder-three-kidnapped-israeli-youths-has-set-dangerous-new-spate |title=Israelis and Palestinians: A vicious circle speeds up again |newspaper=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of scholars{{citation needed|reason=Scholars wouldn't overlook the wanton destruction of the dairy|date=July 2014}} rejected the claim that Operation Brother's Keeper constitutes collective punishment under international law:
* Robbie Sabel, a professor of [[international law]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] and a former legal adviser to [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israel's Foreign Ministry]], stated that Israel's actions cannot be considered collective punishment as they are aimed exclusively at finding the kidnapped teenagers and weakening the terrorist organizations behind their abduction and that in a search for kidnapped civilians, the arrests of members affiliated with the organization responsible for the kidnapping is legitimate.&lt;ref name=TOI23614&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahren|first=Raphael|title=Is Israel's operation to find kidnapped teens a war crime?|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/is-israels-operation-to-find-kidnapped-teens-a-war-crime |accessdate=27 June 2014|work=The Times of Israel|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Eugene Kontorovich, international law professor at [[Northwestern University]] and Hebrew University has stated, "rounding up suspects, or potential witnesses, is not punishment, but rather rudimentary investigative process; especially when the crime is thought to be committed by a complex terror organization, the number of potential witnesses is high." Kontorovich cited as an example that police often arrest members of a gang after a crime to further investigate the perpetrators or criminal acts.&lt;ref name=TOI23614 /&gt;

==Speculations on kidnapping motives==

In an address to the [[World Economic Forum]] in May 2013, Mahmoud Abbas stated that a primary concern of Palestinian society is the approximately 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. The problem could be handled by negotiated concessions or by abductions, used to get them back. This has been called his [[Prisoner's dilemma]], and he asked if Israel wanted more Shalit kidnapping cases, a practice he maintained went against the grain of Palestinian culture. Hamas quickly challenged his statement as 'unpatriotic'.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Elhanan |last=Miller |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/mahmoud-abbass-prisoners-dilemma/ |title=Mahmoud Abbas's prisoner dilemma |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=17 June 2014|accessdate= 4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some months before the 2014 incident, an 18-page manual on abduction techniques was published by Hamas. Entitled "Guide for the Kidnapper", it provided an operational guide that outlined the use of pistols with silencers, the use of backup cars, the choice of conducting the abductions on rainy days, a command of Hebrew, the renting of hideouts in areas to avoid arousing suspicions and suggestions to refrain from announcing the outcome of the kidnapping until the victims were secured in a safe house.&lt;ref name="Bar'el"&gt;{{cite news |first=Zvi |last=Bar'el |url=http://www.haaretz.com/.premium-1.598993 |title=Egypt cooperating with Israeli search efforts for kidnapped teens, while Hamas faces catch-22 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatah is reported to believe that [[Ismail Haniyeh]] has given the go-ahead to Palestinian cells to pursue such tactics in order to "bring the prisoners affair to an end".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} The difficulty confronting the [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]], which has an ongoing debate on the issue, is the coordination between the PNA and Israeli security services, which makes executing such operations difficult.&lt;ref name="Bar'el" /&gt; Several prior incidents, such as the killings of Givati soldier Gal "Gavriel" Kobi and Baruch Mizrahi, a police intelligence officer, displayed exceptional, high-level skills, strict compartmentalization, and careful preparations for an escape route, features shared by the kidnapping. These elements resemble the carefully planned abductions of IDF soldiers by [[Hezbollah]] on Israel's northern border.&lt;ref name="Harel2" /&gt;

A week into the search for the missing youth, Avi Issacharoff cast doubts on the premise for West Bank operations, which in his view 'targeted the weak'—since Hamas has neither a large or strong presence there—and argued that the operational order, if there was one, came from either Gaza, or abroad, perhaps Ankara-based deportee Saleh al-Arouri, or [[Khaled Mashaal]], who appeared to hint a month earlier in replying to a letter from an imprisoned Hamas leader, after Netanyahu reneged on releasing [[2013–14 Israeli–Palestinian peace talks|a fourth group of Palestinian prisoners]],&lt;ref name="Oren"&gt;{{cite news |first=Amir |last=Oren |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.600055 |title=West Bank kidnapping exposes Israel's disjointed security establishment |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades would be his reply. Issacharoff concluded however that, "There isn't a smoking gun to prove the Hamas leadership is complicit in the kidnapping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Avi |last=Issacharoff |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/a-week-of-raids-and-arrests-but-no-hard-lead-to-the-kidnappers/ |title=A week of raids and arrests, but no hard lead to the kidnappers |newspaper=[[The Times of Israel]] |date=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 August, a Hamas official identified the West Bank Qawasmeh clan, a Hamas ally, for the kidnapping of the three Israeli teens and shared their motives.  Saleh Al-'Arouri of the Hamas leadership delivered an address on behalf of [[Khaled Mashal]] at the conference of the [[International Union of Muslim Scholars]] in [[Istanbul]]. In it he said: "Our goal was to ignite an [[wiktionary:Intifada|intifada]] in the West Bank and Jerusalem, as well as within the 1948 borders... Your brothers in the [[Al-Qassam Brigades]] carried out this operation to support their imprisoned brothers, who were on a hunger strike...

==Hitchhiking debate in Israel==
As events unfolded, the dangerous nature of hitchhiking in what Israelis refer to as "the territories" prompted a debate, regarded by some in the settler and religious Zionist communities as a kind of [[victim blaming]],&lt;ref name="Pfeffer"&gt;{{cite news |first=Anshel |last=Pfeffer |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.598878 |title=Abductions won't stop settlers from hitchhiking |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the practice of hitching rides on roads in the [[Palestinian territories]], widely regarded as a cavalier and irresponsible habit for the costs involved in redeeming anyone who is captured.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Isakersh" /&gt; The normal Israeli practice is one where drivers pull up, declaring their destination, and, by their accent, allowing potential hikers at ''trempiada'' (hitchhiking stations) an opportunity to examine the cues, before they accept or decline a lift.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt; Such hitchhiking has long been a hallowed method of travel among Israelis,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} but as abductions and killings of hitchhikers, mainly IDF soldiers, began to take root in the 1980s,{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} [[Kidnapping of Nachshon Wachsman|one incident in October 1994]] led to the passage of regulations that forbade military personnel from resorting to this method of travel.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} To hammer the message home, recruits doing basic training are required now to view [[snuff film]]s that highlight the dangers, and military police "abduct" and punish recruits who do not take it seriously.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer" /&gt;

Israeli governments have not regulated civilian recourse to hitchhiking, and laws delegate responsibility to parents, expecting them to advise their children.&lt;ref name="CSM" /&gt; The practice however remains widespread among the ''[[Modern Orthodox Judaism|dati leumi]]'' community of [[Religious Zionism|religious Zionists]] for several reasons: many of them, as in this case, have children boarding in West Bank settlements, where public transport facilities are poor.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} ''Haaretz'' reported that for mitzvah-observant adolescents, it is "a rite of passage, a way of life, a declaration of independence and of ownership of the land".&lt;ref name="Pfeffer" /&gt; Retired Brigadier General, Nitzan Nuriel, a former counter-terrorism officer in the Prime Minister's Office, declared on Israeli television that hitchhiking had an ideological edge: it made a statement about who owns the territory.&lt;ref name="Isakersh" /&gt;

====Social media in Israel====
[[File:Bring Back our Boys 2014.jpg|thumb|"Bring back our boys" on Jerusalem bus, June 2014.]]
A [[social media]] campaign was started soon after the kidnapping advocating for the safe return of the teens under the [[hashtag]] #BringBackOurBoys.

====Violent Israeli reactions====
On the night of 1 July a Palestinian family registered a complaint at police concerning an attempt to kidnap their child, 10-year-old Moussa Zalum, on [[Shuafat|Shu'fat]]'s main street in Jerusalem. At the time, they reported, he was walking with his mother and brother when a car stopped and people tried to pull him into the vehicle. The child managed to wriggle free, and the car sped off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/244703/burned-body-of-arab-found-in-jerusalem-forest.html |title=Burned Body of Arab Found in Jerusalem Forest |newspaper=[[Yeshiva World News]] |date=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the bodies of the three boys were found, settlers attacks on Palestinians in the West Bank were reported. Settlers from [[Tel Rumeida]] in Hebron were in the streets, attacking Palestinians and internationals. The Border Police stormed the hill towards the gathered crowd of Palestinians and internationals, exploded a sound grenade and injured a Palestinian in the following clash.&lt;ref name=CPT_responds&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cpt.org/cptnet/2014/07/01/al-khalil-hebron-cpt-palestine-responds-incidents-occurring-after-teenagers%E2%80%99-bodie |place=Al-Khalil (Hebron) |title=CPT Palestine responds to incidents occurring after teenagers' bodies discovered |publisher=CPT |date=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Kidnapping and murder of Mohammed Abu Khdeir}}
On 2 July a 16-year-old Palestinian from [[Shu'fat camp]], Mohammed Abu Khdeir, was killed; preliminary results from the autopsy suggest he was burnt alive.

The Palestinian Authority's official newspaper marked the kidnapping with a cartoon that spoofed the World Cup logo.
Three hands hold the globe in the FIFA World Cup logo, but in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, three hands held small helpless figures with their hands up in surrender. While the World Cup logo says "Brazil" under it, the spoof says Khalil, the Arabic name for Hebron, a city near the site of the kidnapping.&lt;ref name="jewishnews1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishnews.net.au/pa-cartoon-glorifies-kidnapping/35689 |title=PA cartoon glorifies kidnapping |newspaper=[[The Australian Jewish News]] |date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cartoon on a Fatah Facebook page presented the three kidnapped Israeli teenagers as rats caught on three hooks on a fishing rod. Each rat was emblazoned with a Star of David, and the title of the cartoon read "Masterstroke". A picture on the same Facebook page showed a hand with words written on three of the fingers.

'''Aaron Doral''' ('''Number Five''') is a [[fictional character]] from the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series.

==The first Doral==
Prior to [[Destruction of the Twelve Colonies|the Fall]], Aaron Doral is the civilian [[Public Relations Officer]] aboard the battlestar ''Galactica''. During the events of the [[Battlestar Galactica (miniseries)|miniseries]], [[Gaius Baltar]]'s attention is drawn by his apparational [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]] to a device in the ''Galactica'''s [[Combat Information Center|CIC]]. Six convinces Baltar that it is a Cylon device and that he can do nothing about it without revealing his connection to her. Panicking, Baltar wonders aloud whether Doral (whose movements are relatively unsupervised) could be a Cylon agent, which Six denies. Baltar accuses Doral anyway, and the [[Executive Officer|XO]], Col. [[Saul Tigh]], throws Doral in the brig. 

Doral emphatically denies being a Cylon, but after Cdr. [[William Adama]] is forced to kill [[Leoben Conoy|Number Two]], Baltar frames Doral with what he claims is a "Cylon test." Unwilling to risk the chance that Baltar is right, Adama abandons Doral (presumably to die) at the [[Ragnar Anchorage]] when the ragtag fleet leaves the Cyrannus system forever. The audience swiftly learns, however, that Baltar was (unwittingly) correct: Soon after the ''Galactica'' leaves Ragnar, Doral is rescued by several Twos, Fives, Sixes, and at least one [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Eight]].

==Number Five==
Throughout the show, the Colonial authorities tend to use "Doral" and "Leoben" as generic terms for Numbers Two and Five respectively. A second Five detonates a suicide bomb in the episode [[Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)|Litmus]], and many more Fives appear operating Cylon baseships and the Cylon occupations of the Colonies and New Caprica. The Fives side with the Ones and Fours in the brief [[Cylon Civil War]].

==Personality==
The Fives have an unassuming, "average" appearance in order to better blend into the background. Several Fives appear to have positions of authority among the Cylons, acting as an overseer. For example, the project to have an Eight seduce [[Karl Agathon|Karl "Helo" Agathon]] is supervised by a Five who monitors and directs the situation with apparent curiosity.   

Others, however, seem to have below-average intelligence: In "[[Battlestar Galactica: The Plan|The Plan]]," a [[John Cavil|Number One]] berates a confused Doral copy (wearing clothing nearly identical to the first copy encountered by the Colonials) for his lack of disguise and caution while wandering the ''Galactica''. A later scene shows a small group of Doral copies assigned to menial labor disposing of masses of human corpses on occupied Caprica, doing work they complain is below them and should be handled by Centurions. 

The Fives seem more fanatical and compassionless than the other humanoid Cylons, excluding the Number Ones. They are the only humanoid Cylon model never shown in any kind of romantic or sexual relationship. They discuss the genocide of mankind in calm, functional abstractions, and unhesitatingly resort to violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)|Occupation]]; [[Litmus (Battlestar Galactica)|Litmus]].&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Torn(Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]" a Number Eight accuses Doral of "barely even being able to say [God's] name," suggesting that the Fives' pieties are a sham.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">'''Aaron ben Meir of Brest''' was a Belarusian rabbi; born about the beginning of the eighteenth century at [[Brest-Litovsk]], [[Belarus]] (then Russia); died there Nov. 3, 1777. He was a descendant of the family of Katzenellenbogen-Padua, and received his Talmudical instruction from [[Eliezer ben Eliezer Kolir]], a well-known Pilpulist and the author of a number of rabbinical works.

Aaron carried the [[Pilpul]] method to its extreme limits, and was the author of "Minḥat Aharon" (Aaron's Offering, Novydvor, 1792), a work containing glosses on the Talmudic treatise Sanhedrin, and a masterpiece of rabbinical dialectics (Pilpul). At the end of the work is an appendix, called "Minḥah Belulah," which contains responsa and commentaries on Talmudic topics. Some of his responsa may be found in the "Meḳor Mayim Ḥayyim" (Sudilkov, 1836), a work by his grandson, [[Jacob Meir of Padua]]. Aaron's father was one of the leaders ({{proper name|allufim}}) of the Jewish community of Brest-Litovsk; and his signature is attached to a letter sent in 1752 by that community to [[Jonathan Eybeschütz]] assuring him of their support in his dispute with Emden.

'''''Allahabad''''' was an iron [[sailing ship]] of 1,190 tons gross and 1,143 tons net register. It was built in [[Liverpool]] in 1864, and at the time of her loss was the property of Thomas Wall Stephens of [[London]] and him being the managing owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mariners.records.nsw.gov.au/1881/12/019all.htm |title=Allahabad |publisher=Mariners.records.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2015-07-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304185412/http://mariners.records.nsw.gov.au/1881/12/019all.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Allahabad'' last left [[Glasgow]] on 2 July 1886, with a crew of 20 and a cargo of 1,712 tons, of which 1,635 were coals, bound to [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. Having been signalled on 7 July off the Tuscar, she was on 4 September following, spoken, in about {{coord|29|S|28|W}} by ''South Australian''.

Experiencing an ambiguous loss can lead to personal questions, such as, "Am I still married to my missing spouse?," or "Am I still a child to a parent who no longer remembers me?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boss|first1=Pauline|title=Insights: ambiguous loss: living with frozen grief.|journal=The Harvard mental health letter / from Harvard Medical School|date=November 1999|volume=16|issue=5|pages=4–6|pmid=10521908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the grief process in an ambiguous loss is halted, it is harder to cope or move on to acceptance from the type of loss experienced. There are various types of grief that can occur due to the type of ambiguity experienced and corresponding therapy techniques to address the certain types of grief. The overall goal of therapy to cope with ambiguous loss is to overcome the trauma associated with it and restoring resilience.&lt;ref name=GestaltRoos&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roos|first1=Susan|title=Chronic Sorrow and Ambiguous Loss: Gestalt Methods for Coping with Grief|journal=Gestalt Review|date=2013|volume=17|issue=3|pages=229-239}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of ambiguous loss ==

An ambiguous loss can be physical or psychological in nature.

===Physical loss===
A physical ambiguous loss means that the body of a loved one is no longer around, such as a missing person or unrecovered body from war, but is still remembered psychologically due to the chance of coming back, for example in missing person cases.&lt;ref name=Boss.1 /&gt; A physical ambiguous loss can occur across generations, such as the families of victims of the holocaust, and can cause as traumatic distress as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boss|first1=Pauline|title=The Trauma and Complicated Grief of Ambiguous Loss|journal=Pastoral Psychology|date=April 2010|volume=59|issue=2|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Psychological loss===
The second type of ambiguous loss is where a person is still physically there, but is psychologically absent.&lt;ref name=Boss.1 /&gt; This happens in cases where the brain is affected, therefore affecting the behavior or well being of the individual. Psychological ambiguous loss does not just occur to family and friends of the person affected. Psychological loss can happen personally in terms of one losing sense of who they are. This can stem from having a traumatic brain injury and not knowing who they are, causing a lost feeling and uncertain identity issues.&lt;ref name=MTBI&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landau|first1=Judith|last2=Hissett|first2=Jennifer|title=Mild traumatic brain injury: Impact on identity and ambiguous loss in the family.|journal=Families, Systems, &amp; Health|date=March 2008|volume=26|issue=1|page=74|doi=10.1037/1091-7527.26.1.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grieving process==
The grieving process for an ambiguous loss differs from regular [[mourning]] in unable to gain closure due to unresolved grief.&lt;ref name="Boss book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boss|first1=Pauline|title=Ambiguous Loss: Learning to Live with Unresolved Grief|date=November 1, 2000|publisher=Harvard University Press|pages=9-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In cases of a psychological ambiguous loss, the grieving process can be especially difficult because of the inability to accept or admit that there is a problem and cannot confront their situation in the first place in order to deal with the problem.&lt;ref name=Resilience&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrams|first1=Madeleine Seifter|title=Resilience in Ambiguous Loss.|journal=American Journal of Psychotherapy|date=Spring 2001|volume=55|issue=2|page=284}}&lt;/ref&gt; One key factor in getting over an ambiguous loss is resilience.  In the normal grieving process, people obtain [[Closure (psychology)|closure]] after dealing with a loss. In an ambiguous loss, closure does not exist, and should not be sought after in this case.&lt;ref name=Boss.1 /&gt;
===Resilience===
[[Psychological resilience|Resilience]] and hope are important in the case of an ambiguous loss because paired together, they are able to allow the individual to come to terms with the loss and continue moving forward in life.&lt;ref name="Boss book" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Resilience/&gt; Some ways to tell that one is resilient in a case with ambiguous loss is actively seek out help when they know it is needed.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walsh|first1=Froma|title=Strengthening Family Resilience|date=September 25, 1998|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uncontrollable factors such as culture, age, socioeconomic status, and genetics are all factors that contribute to resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boss|first1=Pauline|title=Loss, Trauma, and Resilience: Therapeutic Work with Ambiguous Loss|date=2006|publisher=WW Norton &amp; Company|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trauma and ambiguous loss often co-exist together and if the trauma is not dealt with it can trigger unresolved emotions.&lt;ref name=GestaltRoos/&gt; Therapy will address a case of ambiguous loss by restoring resilience, and reconnecting with the loss and the relationship with whom the loss is associated.&lt;ref name=GestaltRoos/&gt;

===Three types of grief===
The difference between regular grief and grief from an ambiguous loss is the type of loss creates the type of grief experienced.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boss|first1=Pauline|last2=Carnes|first2=Donna|title=The Myth of Closure|journal=Family Process|date=December 2012|volume=51|issue=4|pages=456–469|doi=10.1111/famp.12005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pauline Boss — The Myth of Closure -|url=https://onbeing.org/programs/pauline-boss-the-myth-of-closure/|newspaper=On Being}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grief in ambiguous loss can be both beneficial and difficult. Since the grief in an ambiguous loss differs than the linear stages of [[grief]] there is no pressure to move on or achieve closure, and this allows for people to remember the lost loved one and move on with relationships and life.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth/&gt; There are three specific types of grief that can develop from the type of ambiguous loss. 
====Anticipatory grief====
Anticipatory grief occurs before bereavement, mourning after death occurs, and upon realizing that death may be imminent for a loved one, anticipatory grief sets in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coombs|first1=MA|title=The mourning before: can anticipatory grief theory inform family care in adult intensive care?|journal=International journal of palliative nursing|date=December 2010|volume=16|issue=12|page=481|pmid=21240101|doi=10.12968/ijpn.2010.16.12.580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth/&gt; This type of grief is common among families who have a loved one living with Alzheimer's disease. The grief becomes anticipatory due to the knowledge that the loved one's mental state will only become worse, so the grieving process can start very early.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth/&gt;

====Disenfranchised grief====
The second type of grief that can develop from an ambiguous loss is disenfranchised grief.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth /&gt;&lt;ref name=PetLoss&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cordaro|first1=Millie|title=Pet Loss and Disenfranchised Grief: Implications for Mental Health Counseling Practice.|journal=Journal of Mental Health Counseling|date=October 2012|volume=34|issue=4|pages=283-294}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as unrecognized grief because it often occurs in the loss of a beloved pet and the grief is not taken seriously.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth /&gt;&lt;ref name=PetLoss/&gt;
====Frozen grief====
Frozen grief is the third type of grief, it is a result of the ambiguity of death because of the physical or psychological disappearance and therefore one's grief is frozen since they do not get a chance to let grief run a normal course.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boss|first1=Pauline|title=The Trauma and Complicated Grief of Ambiguous Loss|journal=Pastoral Psychology|date=11 November 2009|volume=59|issue=2|pages=137–145|doi=10.1007/s11089-009-0264-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term "ambiguous loss" was first used in the 1970s by Pauline Boss, a researcher who studied families of soldiers who went missing in action and coined the term in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth /&gt; During her research, Boss, had previously used the term boundary ambiguity from 1973 up until 1977, and that term was later replaced with ambiguous loss in 1977.&lt;ref name=ClosureMyth /&gt;

The word amphicarp is the contraction of the Greek words ''ἀμφί'' meaning "of both kinds" and ''καρπός'' meaning fruit.&lt;!---The concept of amphicarpy was probably coined by Ernst HUTH 1890 in hiw Ueber Geokarpe, Amphikarpe, und Heterokarpe Pflanzen, but I have not been able to see it---&gt;&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|website= Dictionary.com |title= Amphicarpous |url= http://www.dictionary.com/browse/amphicarpous|accessdate= 2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a typical plant with amphicarpy, one fruit type is underground. These [[Geocarpy|underground fruits]] usually develop from [[Self-pollination|self-pollinating]] flowers. The fruits that develop from the aerial flowers may often be the result of [[Pollination#Mechanism|cross-pollination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Focko|last= Weberling|year= 1992|title= Morphology of Flowers and Inflorescences|publisher= CUP Archive|isbn= 9780521438322|page= 345 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=-ZlOAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants use this strategy to increase the chance that their genetic material is passed on. It can be referred to as [[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet hedging]] in which an organism produces several different [[phenotypes]]. Seeds from the underground flowers have low genetic variability (due to their selfing), tend to be larger, and may germinate from within the tissues of the flower, so ensuring that the annual can remain at the site that was suitable to it in the preceding year. Seeds from aerial flowers usually have greater genetic variability, tend to be smaller, and may be spread further. This assists the colonization of new territory, but also helps the exchange of genetic material between populations.&lt;ref name=RdC&gt;{{cite journal|first= E.|last= Ruiz de Clavijo|year= 1995|title= The Ecological Significance of Fruit Heteromorphism in the Amphicarpic Species ''Catananche lutea'' (Asteraceae)|journal= International Journal of Plant Sciences|volume= 156|issue= 6|pages= 824–833|jstor= 2475114|doi=10.1086/297306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, approximately fifty species exhibit amphicarpy, or 0.02% of the known species of flowering plants. Most of these fifty species occur in often disturbed or very stressful circumstances. In Israel, a country that harbors many disturbed habitats, with eight out of a total flora of twenty five hundred species, a much higher percentage of 0.32% is amphicarpic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1= Vicki A.|last1= Funk|first2= Ori|last2= Fragman-Sapir|year= 2009|chapter= 22.

'''Anne Ector Pleasant''' (April 16, 1878 – September 13, 1934) was an American school teacher and founder of the private school Pleasant Hall in Shreveport which operated for more than fifty years. Between 1916 and 1920, she was the First Lady of Louisiana and though she supported women's suffrage, she was not in favor of passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Nineteenth Amendment]], believing voting rights were a state rather than a federal issue.

==Early life==
Anne Ector was born on April 16, 1878 in [[Marshall, Texas]] to Sarah Parish "Sally" (née Chew) and General [[Mathew Ector|Matthew D. Ector]].{{sfn|''The Marshall Morning News''|1934|p=3}}{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1936|p=11}}{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1953|p=26}} Her father was a [[brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]], who was wounded during the [[Atlanta Campaign]] in 1864 and then returned to Texas where he served as a judge. At the time of his death in 1879, he was the presiding judge of the Court of Appeals.{{sfn|Lynch|1885|p=167}} Her mother was originally from Kentucky and after her husband's death raised Anne and her siblings, Helen, Walker and William.{{sfn|U. S. Census|1880|p=13}}{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1925|p=8}} Ector attended Belwood Seminary in [[Anchorage, Kentucky]] and went on to further her schooling at the [[Sam Houston Normal Institute]] in [[Huntsville, Texas]],{{sfn|''The Marshall Morning News''|1934|p=3}} graduating in 1899.{{sfn|''The Normal Bulletin''|1911|p=50}}

==Career==
After completing her education, Ector began teaching in Texas and taught for several years until her marriage on February 14, 1906 to [[Ruffin Pleasant]], who was the city attorney for Shreveport, Louisiana. After her marriage, Pleasant was active in the [[woman's club movement]], serving as president of the district [[General Federation of Women's Clubs|Federation of Women's Clubs]],{{sfn|''The Marshall Morning News''|1934|p=3}} while her husband served for six years as city attorney and then worked in private practice as a lawyer. He was appointed as assistant attorney general in 1911, causing the couple to move to [[New Orleans]] and then was made attorney general in 1912.{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1934|p=8}} After four years, he was elected as [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]].{{sfn|Prime|2015|p=A-3}} During his governorship, Pleasant was active in the suffrage movement. While she was in favor of [[women's suffrage]], she was against the passage of the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], believing that states, rather than the federal government should determine who should be eligible to vote.{{sfn|Wheeler|1995|p=266}}

In 1920, when her term as First Lady ended, the couple returned to Shreveport. Within three years, Pleasant, who had been privately tutoring students in her home, opened Pleasant Hall, a private elementary school.{{sfn|Prime|2015|p=A-4}} The school focused on basic studies in reading, writing and arithmetic, but also offered instruction in French, English grammar and both music and art.{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1939|p=28}} Classes were held in the couple's home, which was located at 1703 Highland Avenue, on the corner with Wyandotte Street.{{sfn|Prime|2015|p=A-3}}{{sfn|Godfrey|1960|p=61}}

Pleasant was known as an opponent of Louisiana politician [[Huey Long]] and the two had a history of oral conflicts.{{sfn|'' The Weekly Town Talk''|1933|p=11}} In 1933, she made national headlines when she sued Long, alleging that while investigating documentation on nepotism and "questionable use and disposition" of the public's taxes in government institutions, she was removed from the courthouse, arrested and [[Defamation|slandered]] when Long called her a "drunken, cursing woman".{{sfn|''The Baltimore Sun''|1933|p=5}}{{sfn|''The Tampa Tribune|1933|p=4}} Initially, she asked for $250,000, but the amended her petition to double the amount, when she felt Long was trying to intimidate her.{{sfn|'' The Weekly Town Talk''|1933|p=11}}{{sfn|''The Tampa Tribune|1933|p=4}} Long tried to have the case dismissed on the grounds that under Louisiana law Pleasant could not sue in her own name, as under the state community property law, the suit would only be proper if filed in her husband's name. District Judge W. Carruth Jones rejected the argument based on similar cases that had been elevated to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]].{{sfn|'' The Weekly Town Talk''|1934|p=6}}

==Death and legacy==
Pleasant died on September 13, 1934, after being rushed to the hospital in Shreveport, having accidentally consumed poison when she drank an antiseptic, thinking it was her medicine.{{sfn||''The Marshall Morning News''|1934|p=1}}{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1934|p=1}} After her death, her husband took over the operation of Pleasant Hall and ran it until his death in 1937.{{sfn|''The Shreveport Times''|1939|p=28}} When he died, his sister, Mrs. Lucille Johnson took over the management of the school,{{sfn|Godfrey|1960|p=61}} which continued operating until the 1970s and maintained a reputation for its high educational standard in liberal arts. The home where the school was housed is noted by a tourist marker, as the last remaining home in Shreveport occupied by a state governor.{{sfn|Prime|2015|p=A-3}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31922">{{The Works of Aristotle}}[[Aristotle]] first used the term [[ethics]] to name a field of study developed by his predecessors [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]]. Philosophical ethics is the attempt to offer a rational response to the question of how humans should best live. Aristotle regarded ethics and [[politics]] as two related but separate fields of study, since ethics examines the good of the individual, while politics examines the good of the city-state.

Aristotle's writings have been read more or less continuously since ancient times,&lt;ref&gt;"Roman Aristotle," in ''Philosophia Togata II: Plato and Aristotle at Rome'', Oxford University Press (Oxford: 1997), pp. 1–69.&lt;/ref&gt;  and his ethical treatises in particular continue to influence philosophers working today. Aristotle emphasized the importance of developing excellence ([[virtue]]) of character (Greek ''ēthikē [[arete (moral virtue)|aretē]]''), as the way to achieve what is finally more important, excellent conduct (Greek ''[[energeia]]''). As Aristotle argues in Book II of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', the man who possesses character excellence does the right thing, at the right time, and in the right way. Bravery, and the correct regulation of one's bodily appetites, are examples of character excellence or virtue. So acting bravely and acting temperately are examples of excellent activities. The highest aims are living well and ''[[eudaimonia]]'' a Greek word often translated as well-being, [[happiness]] or "human flourishing".&lt;ref&gt;''Nicomachean Ethics'', trans. T.H. Irwin, Introduction. Hackett Publishing Company (Indianapolis: 1999) ''xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many ethicists, Aristotle regards excellent activity as pleasurable for the man of virtue. For example, Aristotle thinks that the man whose appetites are in the correct order actually takes pleasure in acting moderately.

Aristotle emphasized that virtue is practical, and that the purpose of ethics is to become good, not merely to know. Aristotle also claims that the right course of action depends upon the details of a particular situation, rather than being generated merely by applying a law. The type of wisdom which is required for this is called "prudence" or "practical wisdom" (Greek ''[[phronesis]]''), as opposed to the wisdom of a theoretical philosopher (Greek ''[[wikt:σοφία#Ancient Greek|sophia]]''). But despite the importance of practical decision making, in the final analysis the original Aristotelian and Socratic answer to the question of how best to live, at least for the best types of human, was to live the life of [[philosophy]].'

== Three ethical treatises ==

Three Aristotelian ethical works survive today which are considered to be either by Aristotle, or from relatively soon after:
* ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', abbreviated as the ''NE'' or sometimes (from the Latin version of the name) as the ''EN''. The ''NE'' is in 10 books, and is the most widely read of Aristotle's ethical treatises.
* ''[[Eudemian Ethics]]'', often abbreviated as the ''EE''.
* ''[[Magna Moralia]]'', often abbreviated as the ''MM''.

The exact origins of these texts is unclear, although they were already considered the works of Aristotle in ancient times. Textual oddities suggest that they may not have been put in their current form by Aristotle himself. For example, Books IV–VI of ''Eudemian Ethics'' also appear as Books V–VII of ''Nicomachean Ethics''. The authenticity of the ''Magna Moralia'' has been doubted,&lt;ref&gt;But for an argument that the Magna Moralia's philosophical content (if not the language) is authentically Aristotle's, see: John M. Cooper, "The Magna Moralia and Aristotle's Moral Philosophy," in ''The American Journal of Philology'' 94.4 (Winter, 1973): pp. 327–49.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas almost no modern scholar doubts that Aristotle wrote the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics'' himself, even if an editor also played some part in giving us those texts in their current forms.

The ''Nicomachean Ethics'' has received the most scholarly attention, and is the most easily available to modern readers in many different translations and editions. Some critics consider the ''Eudemian Ethics'' to be "less mature," while others, such as Kenny (1978),&lt;ref&gt;''The Aristotelian Ethics: A Study of the Relationship between the Eudemian and Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle,'' (Oxford 1978).&lt;/ref&gt; contend that the ''Eudemian Ethics'' is the more mature, and therefore later, work.

Traditionally it was believed that the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' and the ''Eudemian Ethics'' were either edited by or dedicated to Aristotle's son and pupil [[Nicomachus (son of Aristotle)|Nicomachus]] and his disciple Eudemus, respectively, although the works themselves do not explain the source of their names.  Although Aristotle's father was also called Nicomachus, Aristotle's son was the next leader of Aristotle's school, the [[Lyceum]], and in ancient times he was already associated with this work.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero mentioned him in ''De Finibus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth treatise, Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|''Politics'']], is often regarded as the sequel to the Ethics, in part because Aristotle closes the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' by saying that his ethical inquiry has laid the groundwork for an inquiry into political questions (''NE'' X.1181b6-23). Aristotle's Ethics also states that the good of the individual is subordinate to the good of the city-state, or ''polis''.

Fragments also survive from Aristotle's [[Protrepticus (Aristotle)|''Protrepticus'']], another work which dealt with ethics.

== Aristotle as a Socratic ==

Some scholars regarded Aristotle as a Socratic thinker.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} Aristotle's ethics builds upon earlier Greek thought, particularly that of his teacher [[Plato]] and Plato's teacher, [[Socrates]]. While Socrates left no written works, and Plato wrote dialogues and a few letters, Aristotle wrote treatises in which he sets forth philosophical doctrines directly. To be more precise, Aristotle did write dialogues, but they unfortunately survive only in fragments.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

According to Aristotle in his ''Metaphysics'', Socrates was the first Greek philosopher to concentrate on ethics, although he apparently did not give it this name, as a philosophical inquiry concerning how people should best live. Aristotle dealt with this same question but giving it two names, "the political" (or Politics) and "the ethical" (Ethics), both with Politics being the name for the two together as the more important part. The original Socratic questioning on ethics started at least partly as a response to [[sophism]], which was a popular style of education and speech at the time. Sophism emphasized [[rhetoric]], and argument, and therefore often involved criticism of [[ancient Greek religion|traditional Greek religion]] and flirtation with [[moral relativism]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Aristotle's ethics, or study of character, is built around the premise that people should achieve an excellent character (a virtuous character, "''ethikē aretē''" in Greek) as a pre-condition for attaining happiness or well-being (''eudaimonia''). It is sometimes referred to in comparison to later ethical theories as a "character based ethics". Like Plato and Socrates he emphasized the importance of [[reason]] for human happiness, and that there were logical and natural reasons for humans to behave virtuously, and try to become virtuous.

Aristotle's treatment of the subject is distinct in several ways from that found in Plato's Socratic dialogues.

*Aristotle's presentation is obviously different from Plato's because he does not write in [[dialogue]]s, but in [[treatise]]s. Apart from this difference, Aristotle explicitly stated that his presentation was different from Plato's because he started from whatever could be agreed upon by well brought-up gentlemen, and not from any attempt to develop a general theory of what makes anything good. He explained that it was necessary not to aim at too much accuracy at the starting point of any discussion to do with controversial matters such as those concerning what is just or what is beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;NE Book I, EE Book I&lt;/ref&gt; (From this starting point however, he built up to similar theoretical conclusions concerning the importance of intellectual virtue and a contemplative life.)&lt;ref&gt;NE end of Book VI and end of Book X. Also see Burger (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
*Rather than discussing only four "[[cardinal virtues]]" of Plato ([[courage]], [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]], [[justice]], and [[prudence]]), all three of the ethical works start with courage and temperance as the two typical moral virtues which can be described as a mean, go on to discuss a whole range of minor virtues and vices which can be described as a mean, and only after that touch upon justice and the intellectual virtues. Aristotle places prudence (''phronēsis'', often translated as practical wisdom) amongst these intellectual virtues. (Nevertheless, like Plato he eventually says that all the highest forms of the moral virtues require each other, and all require intellectual virtue, and in effect that the happiest and most virtuous life is that of a philosopher.)&lt;ref&gt;Burger (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aristotle emphasizes throughout all his analyses of virtues that they aim at what is beautiful (''kalos''), effectively equating [[The Good|the good]], at least for humans, with the beautiful (''to kalon'').&lt;ref&gt;Burger (2008); Sachs (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Aristotle's analysis of ethics makes use of his metaphysical theory of [[potentiality and actuality]]. He defines happiness in terms of this theory as an actuality (''energeia''); the virtues which allow happiness (and enjoyment of the best and most constant pleasures) are dynamic-but-stable dispositions (''hexeis'') which are developed through habituation; and this pleasure in turn is another actuality that compliments the actuality of happy living.&lt;ref&gt;NE Book X&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practical ethics ==

[[Aristotle]] believed that ethical knowledge is not only a [[theory|theoretical]] knowledge, but rather that a person must have "experience of the actions in life" and have been "brought up in fine habits" to become good ([[Nicomachean Ethics|NE]] 1095a3 and b5). For a person to become virtuous, he can't simply study what virtue ''is'', but must actually do virtuous things.

{{cquote|We are not studying in order to know what virtue is, but to become good, for otherwise there would be no profit in it. ''(NE'' II.2)}}

== Aristotle's starting point ==

The Aristotelian Ethics all aim to begin with approximate but uncontroversial starting points. In the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' Aristotle says explicitly that one must begin with what is familiar to us, and "the that" or "the fact that" (''NE'' I.1095b2-13). Ancient commentators agree that what Aristotle means here is that his treatise must rely upon practical, everyday knowledge of virtuous actions as the starting points of his inquiry, and that he is supposing that his readers have some kind of experience-based understanding of such actions, and that they value noble and just actions to at least some degree.&lt;ref&gt;See M.F. Burnyeat, "Aristotle on Learning to be Good," in ''Essays on Aristotle's Ethics'', ed. Rorty (1980) pp. 71–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere, Aristotle also seems to rely upon common conceptions of how the world works. In fact, some regard his ethical inquiries as using a method that relies upon popular opinion (his so-called "endoxic method" from the Grk. ''endoxa''). There is some dispute, however, about exactly how such common conceptions fit into Aristotle's method in his ethical treatises,&lt;ref&gt;Martha Nussbaum, for example, has argued that Aristotle's so-called endoxic method, described at ''NE'' VII.1145b1 ff. is in fact Aristotle's general philosophical method. See Nussbaum, ''Fragility of Goodness'' (Cambridge: 1986/2001) pp. 240 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly since he also makes use of more formal arguments, especially the so-called "function argument," which is described below.

Aristotle describes popular accounts about what kind of life would be a happy one by classifying them into three most common types: a life dedicated to vulgar pleasure; a life dedicated to fame and honor; and a life dedicated to contemplation (''NE'' I.1095b17-19). To reach his own conclusion about the best life, however, Aristotle tries to isolate the function of humans. The argument he develops here is accordingly widely known as "the function argument," and is among the most-discussed arguments made by any ancient philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Rachel Barney, "Aristotle's Argument for a Human Function," in ''Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy'' 34 (Summer 2008) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues that while humans undergo nutrition and growth, so do other living things, and while humans are capable of perception, this is shared with animals (''NE'' I.1098b22-1098a15). Thus neither of these characteristics is particular to humans. According to Aristotle, what remains and what is distinctively human is reason. Thus he concludes that the human function is some kind of excellent exercise of the intellect. And, since Aristotle thinks that practical wisdom rules over the character excellences, exercising such excellences is one way to exercise reason and thus fulfill the human function.

One common objection to Aristotle's function argument is that it uses descriptive or factual premises to derive conclusions about what is good.&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Jennifer Whiting in an article that defends the argument. See Whiting, "Aristotle's Function Argument: A Defense" ''Ancient Philosophy'' 8, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Such arguments are often thought to run afoul of the [[is-ought problem|is-ought gap]].

== Moral virtue ==

Moral virtue, or excellence of character, is the disposition (Grk ''hexis'') to act excellently, which a person develops partly as a result of his upbringing, and partly as a result of his habit of action. Aristotle develops his analysis of character in Book II of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', where he makes this argument that character arises from habit—likening ethical character to a skill that is acquired through practice, such as learning a musical instrument. In Book III of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'', Aristotle argues that a person's character is voluntary, since it results from many individual actions which are under his voluntary control.

Aristotle distinguishes the disposition to feel emotions of a certain kind from virtue and vice. But such emotional dispositions may also lie at a mean between two extremes, and these are also to some extent a result of up-bringing and habituation. Two examples of such dispositions would be modesty, or a tendency to feel shame, which Aristotle discusses in NE IV.9; and righteous indignation (''nemesis''), which is a balanced feeling of sympathetic pain concerning the undeserved pleasures and pains of others.&lt;ref&gt;EE III.vii. Also see MM.&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly which habitual dispositions are virtues or vices and which only concern emotions, differs between the different works which have survived, but the basic examples are consistent, as is the basis for distinguishing them in principle.

Some people, despite intending to do the right thing, cannot act according to their own choice. For example, someone may choose to refrain from eating chocolate cake, but finds himself eating the cake contrary to his own choice. Such a failure to act in a way that is consistent with one's own decision is called "''akrasia''", and may be translated as weakness of will, incontinence, or lack of self-mastery.

== Four Cardinal Virtues ==
# '''Prudence''', also known as practical wisdom, is the most important virtue for Aristotle. In war, soldiers must fight with prudence by making judgments through practical wisdom. This virtue is a must to obtain because courage requires judgments to be made.
# '''Temperance''', or self-control, simply means moderation. Soldiers must display moderation with their enjoyment while at war in the midst of violent activities. Temperance concerning courage gives one moderation in private which leads to moderation in public.
# '''Courage''' is “moderation or observance of the mean with respect to feelings of fear and confidence.”  Courage is “observance of the mean with regard to things that excite confidence or fear, under the circumstances which we have specified, and chooses its course and sticks to its post because it is noble to do so, or because it is disgraceful not to do so.”   Concerning warfare, Aristotle believes soldiers are morally significant and are military and political heroes. War is simply a stage for soldiers to display courage, and is the only way courage can be exemplified. Any other action by a human is simply the copying a soldier's ways; they are not actually courageous.
# '''Justice''' means giving the enemy what is due to them in the proper ways; being just toward them. In other words, one must recognize what is good for the community and one must undertake a good course of action.
Vices of courage must also be identified which are cowardice and recklessness. Soldiers who are not prudent act with cowardice, and soldiers who do not have temperance act with recklessness. One should not be unjust toward their enemy no matter the circumstance. On another note, one becomes virtuous by first imitating another who exemplifies such virtuous characteristics, practicing such ways in their daily lives, turning those ways into customs and habits by performing them each and every day, and finally, connecting or uniting the four of them together.

Only soldiers can exemplify such virtues because war demands soldiers to exercise disciplined and firm virtues, but war does everything in its power to shatter the virtues it demands. Since virtues are very fragile, they must be practiced always, for if they are not practiced they will weaken and eventually disappear. One who is virtuous has to avoid the enemies of virtue which are indifference or persuasion that something should not be done, self-indulgence or persuasion that something can wait and does not need to be done at that moment, and despair or persuasion that something simply cannot be accomplished anyway. In order for one to be virtuous they must display prudence, temperance, courage, and justice; moreover, they have to display all four of them and not just one or two to be virtuous.

== Justice ==

Aristotle devotes Book V of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' to justice (this is also Book IV of the ''Eudemian Ethics''). In this discussion, Aristotle defines justice as having two different but related senses—general justice and particular justice. General justice is virtue expressed in relation to other people. Thus the just man in this sense deals properly and fairly with others, and expresses his virtue in his dealings with them—not lying or cheating or taking from others what is owed to them.
 
Particular justice is the correct distribution of [[just deserts]] to others. For Aristotle, such justice is proportional—it has to do with people receiving what is proportional to their merit or their worth. In his discussion of particular justice, Aristotle says an educated judge is needed to apply just decisions regarding any particular case. This is where we get the image of the scales of justice, the blindfolded judge symbolizing blind justice, balancing the scales, weighing all the evidence and deliberating each particular case individually.

== The highest good ==

In his ethical works, Aristotle describes ''eudaimonia'' as the highest human good. In Book I of the ''Nicomachean Ethics'' he goes on to identify ''eudaimonia'' as the excellent exercise of the intellect, leaving it open{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} whether he means practical activity or intellectual activity.
With respect to practical activity, in order to exercise any one of the practical excellences in the highest way, a person must possess all the others. Aristotle therefore describes several apparently different kinds of virtuous person as necessarily having all the moral virtues, excellences of character.
*Being of "great soul" ([[magnanimity]]), the virtue where someone would be truly deserving of the highest praise and have a correct attitude towards the honor this may involve. This is the first such case mentioned in the ''Nicomachean Ethics''.&lt;ref&gt;It is mentioned within the initial discussion of practical examples of virtues and vices at [[Nicomachean Ethics#Magnanimity or "greatness of soul"|Book IV]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1123b 1123b].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Being just in the true sense. This is the type of justice or fairness of a good ruler in a good community.&lt;ref&gt;This description occurs for example during the special discussion of the virtue (or virtues) of [[justice]] at [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1129b 1129b] in [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book V: Justice and Fairness: a moral virtue needing special discussion|Book V]].&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Phronesis]]'' or practical wisdom, as shown by good leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in this way at 1144b in [[Nicomachean Ethics#Book VI: Intellectual virtue|Book VI]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1144b 1144b].&lt;/ref&gt;
*The virtue of being a truly good friend.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicomachean Ethics#Books VIII and IX: Friendship and partnership|Book VIII]].[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abekker%20page%3D1157b 1157a]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Having the nobility ''[[kalokagathia]]'' of a gentleman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eudemian Ethics]] Book VIII, chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle also says, for example in NE Book VI, that such a complete virtue requires intellectual virtue, not only practical virtue, but also theoretical wisdom. Such a virtuous person, if they can come into being, will choose the most pleasant and happy life of all, which is the philosophical life of contemplation and speculation.

Aristotle claims that a human's highest functioning must include reasoning, being good at what sets humans apart from everything else. Or, as Aristotle explains it, "The function of man is activity of soul in accordance with reason, or at least not without reason."  He identifies two different ways in which the soul can engage: ''reasoning'' (both practical and theoretical) and ''following reasoning''. A person that does this is the happiest because they are fulfilling their purpose or nature as found in the rational soul.

:(The wise person will) be more than human.  A man will not live like that by virtue of his humanness, but by virtue of some divine thing within him.  His activity is as superior to the activity of the other virtues as this divine thing is to his composite character.  Now if mind is divine in comparison with man, the life of the mind is divine in comparison with mere human life.  We should not follow popular advice and, being human, have only mortal thoughts, but should become immortal and do everything toward living the best in us. ''(NE 10.7)''

In other words, the thinker is not only the 'best' person, but is also most like God.

== Influence on later thinkers ==
{{see also|University of Magnaura}}

Aristotle's writings were taught in the Academy in Athens until 529 CE when the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] closed down non-Christian schools of philosophy.

Aristotle's work however continued to be taught as a part of secular education. Aristotle's teachings spread through the Mediterranean and the Middle East, where some early Islamic regimes allowed rational philosophical descriptions of the natural world. [[Alfarabi]] was a major influence in all medieval philosophy and wrote many works which included attempts to reconcile the ethical and political writings of Plato and Aristotle. Later [[Avicenna]], and later still [[Averroes]], were [[Arabic Philosophy|Islamic philosophers]] who commented on Aristotle as well as writing their own philosophy in Arabic. Averroes, a European Muslim, was particularly influential in turn upon European Christian philosophers, theologians and political thinkers.

In the twelfth century, Latin translations of Aristotle's works were made, enabling the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]] and his pupil [[Thomas Aquinas]] to synthesize Aristotle's philosophy with Christian theology.  Later the medieval church [[scholasticism]] in Western Europe insisted on Thomist views and suppressed non-Aristotelian metaphysics. Aquinas' writings are full of references to Aristotle, and he wrote a commentary on Aristotle's ''Nicomachean Ethics''. Aquinas also departed from Aristotle in certain respects. In particular, his ''Summa Theologica'' argued that ''Eudaimonia'' or human flourishing was held to be a temporary goal for this life, but perfect happiness as the ultimate goal could only be attained in the next life by the virtuous. Aquinas also added new theological virtues to Aristotle's system: faith, hope and charity. And supernatural assistance could help people to achieve virtue. Nevertheless, much of Aristotle's ethical thought remained intact in Aquinas.

In modern times, Aristotle's writings on ethics remain among the most influential in his broad corpus, along with The Rhetoric, and The Poetics, while his scientific writings tend to be viewed as of more strictly historical interest. Modern science develops theories about the physical world based on experiments and careful observation—in particular, on the basis of exact measurements of time and distance. Aristotle, on the other hand, bases his science largely on qualitative and non-experimental observation. Accordingly, he made some inaccurate claims which have been overturned—such as the claim that objects of different mass accelerate at different rates due to gravity.

On the other hand, The ''Nicomachean Ethics'' continues to be relevant to philosophers today. In fact, [[virtue ethics]] takes its inspiration from Aristotle's approach to ethics—in particular, sharing his emphasis on character excellence, and ethical psychology. Some philosophers, in particular Bernard Williams, regard Aristotle's ethics as superior to the Utilitarian and Kantian traditions, which have come to be the dominant approaches to philosophical ethics. Aristotle's well-known function argument is less commonly accepted today, since he seems to use it in order to develop a claim about human perfection from an observation from what is distinctive about man. But the exact role of the function argument in Aristotle's ethical theory is itself a matter of dispute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2857">[[File:States of taphonomic preservation.svg|thumb|300px |Conceptual relationships of biostratinomic processes (yellow) with paleoecology and necrology (green) and fossildiagenesis (orange).&lt;ref name=FL2000&gt;Fernández López, S. R. (2000). ''[http://www.ucm.es/centros/cont/descargas/documento11157.pdf Temas de Tafonomía]''. Department of Paleontology, Complutense University of Madrid. 167 pages. (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Biostratinomy''' is the study of the processes that take place after an organism dies but before its final burial. It is considered to be a subsection of the science of [[taphonomy]], along with [[necrology]] (the study of the death of an organism) and [[diagenesis]] (the changes that take place after final burial). These processes are largely destructive, and include physical, chemical and biological effects:

* [[Physical change|Physical]] effects non-exhaustively include transport, breakage and exhumation.
* [[Chemical]] effects include early changes in mineralogy and oxidation.
* [[Biological]] effects include [[Decomposition|decay]], [[scavenging]], [[bioturbation]], encrustation and [[bioerosion|boring]].

For the vast majority of organisms, biostratinomic destruction is total. However, if at least a few remnants of an organism make it to final burial, a fossil may eventually be formed unless destruction is completed by [[diagenesis]]. As the processes of biostratinomy are often dominated by sedimentological factors, analysis of the biostratinomy of a fossil can reveal important features about the physical environment it once lived in. The boundaries between the three disciplines within taphonomy are partly arbitrary. In particular, the role of microbes in sealing and preserving organisms, for example in a process called [[autolithification]], is now recognised to be a very important and early event in the preservation of many exceptional fossils, often taking place before burial.  Such mineralogical changes might equally be considered to be biostratinomic as diagenetic.

A school of investigation called [[Aktuopaläontologie]], subsisting largely in Germany, attempts to investigate biostratinomic effects by experimentation and observation on extant organisms. William Schäfer's book "Ecology and palaeoecology of marine environments" is a classic product of this sort of investigation.  More recently, [[Derek Briggs|D.E.G. Briggs]] and colleagues have made detailed studies of decay with the prime aim of understanding the profound halt to these processes that is required by exceptional preservation in [[lagerstätten]].

The '''carrick mat''' is a flat woven decorative [[knot]] which can be used as a mat or pad.&lt;ref name="budult"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Geoffrey|last=Budworth|title=The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Knots &amp; Ropework|location=London|publisher=Hermes House|year=1999|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name is based on the mat's decorative-type [[Carrick bend#Decorative uses|carrick bend]] with the ends connected together, forming an [[endless knot]]. A larger form, called the '''prolong knot''', is made by expanding the basic carrick mat by extending, twisting, and overlapping its outer [[bight (knot)|bights]], then weaving the free ends through them.  This process may be repeated to produce an arbitrarily long mat.&lt;ref name="ashley362"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ashley |first=Clifford W. |title=The Ashley Book of Knots|year= 1944 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |isbn= |pages=362–363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its basic form it is the same as a 3-lead, 4-bight [[Turk's head knot]].&lt;ref name="pawpock"&gt;{{Cite book|first=Des|last=Pawson|title=Pocket Guide to Knots &amp; Splices|location=Edison, NJ|publisher=Chartwell Books|year=2002|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic carrick mat, made with two passes of rope, also forms the central motif in the [[logo]] of the [[International Guild of Knot Tyers]].&lt;ref name="igktlogo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igkt.net/publications/index.php |title=IGKT Publications |publisher=International Guild of Knot Tyers |accessdate=2011-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425043555/http://igkt.net/publications/index.php |archivedate=2011-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When tied to form a cylinder around the central opening, instead of lying flat, it can be used as a [[woggle]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10536">'''Character assassination''' is a deliberate and sustained process that destroys the credibility and [[reputation]] of a person, institution, organization, social group, or nation.&lt;ref name="Rojas"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rojas |first1=Rafael |last2=Blanco |first2=Juan Antonio |last3=de Aragon |first3=Uva |last4=Montaner |first4=Carlos Alberto |last5=Faya |first5=Ana Julia |last6=Lupi |first6=Gordiano |title=Aim, Fire! Character Assassination in Cuba |publisher=Eriginal Books |location=Miami |year=2012 |page=12 |isbn=978-1-61370-974-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agents of character assassinations employ a mix of open and covert methods to achieve their goals, such as raising [[false accusations]], planting and fostering rumours, and manipulating information.

Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person's reputation. It may involve [[exaggeration]], misleading [[half-truth]]s, or manipulation of facts to present an untrue picture of the targeted person. It is a form of [[defamation]] and can be a form of ''[[ad hominem]]'' argument.

For living individuals targeted by character assassination attempts, this may result in being rejected by their [[community]], [[family]], or members of their living or work environment. Such acts are often difficult to reverse or rectify, and the process is likened to a literal [[assassination]] of a human life. The damage sustained can last a lifetime or, for historical figures, for many centuries after their death.

The phrase "character assassination" became popular from around 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=character+assassination&amp;case_insensitive=on&amp;year_start=1900&amp;year_end=2008&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t4;,character+assassination;,c0;,s0;;character+assassination;,c0;;Character+assassination;,c0;;Character+Assassination;,c0|title=Google Ngram Viewer|author=|date=|website=books.google.com|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first mentions of the phrasing in literature is dated 1950 in the collection of essays by Jerome Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com.ua/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2699&amp;context=uclrev|title=Review of Character Assassination by Jerome Davis|last=Bettelheim|first=Bruno|publisher=|year=1951|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
In practice, character assassination may involve [[doublespeak]], spreading of [[rumour]]s, [[innuendo]] or deliberate [[misinformation]] on topics relating to the subject's morals, integrity, and reputation.  It may involve [[Spin (public relations)|spinning]] information that is technically true, but that is presented in a misleading manner or is presented without the necessary context.  For example, it might be said that a person refused to pay any [[income tax]] during a specific year, without saying that no tax was actually owed due to the person having no income that year, or that a person was sacked from a firm, even though he may have been made redundant through no fault of his own, rather than being terminated for cause.

Others define character assassination as the deliberate destruction of an individual's reputation, which does not include social groups or institutions. It is important to distinguish between character attacks and character assassination. Character attacks are assaults aimed at a particular individual—as opposed to attacks aimed at certain groups, movements, or nationalities, such as happen in the construction of enemy images.&lt;ref name="IcksShiraev2014"&gt;Martijn Icks &amp; Eric Shiraev (eds.), Character Assassination throughout the Ages (2014). New York: Palgrave and Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;
If they succeed in destroying their victim's reputation, we speak of successful attacks and character assassination. However, attacks can also fail.

Three features of character attacks are important to understand.&lt;ref name="IcksShiraev2014"/&gt; First, their intention: character attacks are by definition deliberate. Second, the public nature of the attacks: private insults do not lead to reputation damage. And third, the importance of the public perception of the attacks, which means that the truth of allegations is irrelevant.

== Narcissism ==
{{Main|Narcissism}}
According to Thomas, character assassination is an intentional attempt, usually by a narcissist and/or his or her [[codependents]], to [[Social influence|influence]] the portrayal or reputation of someone in such a way as to cause others to develop an extremely negative or unappealing perception of him or her. It typically involves deliberate exaggeration or [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] of facts, the spreading of rumours and deliberate misinformation to present an untrue picture of the targeted person, and unwarranted and excessive criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Thomas | first = D | title = Narcissism: Behind the Mask | year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychopathy in the workplace ==
{{Main|Psychopathy in the workplace}}
The authors of the book ''[[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]]'' describe a five phase model of how a typical workplace [[psychopath]] climbs to and maintains [[Power (social and political)|power]]. In phase four (confrontation), the psychopath will use techniques of character assassination to maintain their agenda.&lt;ref name=Snakes&gt;Baibak, P; [[Robert D. Hare|Hare, R. D]] [[Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In politics==
In politics, character assassination is a form of [[negative campaigning]]. [[Opposition research]] is the practice of collecting information on someone that can be used to discredit them. A [[smear campaign]] is the use of falsehoods or distortions. [[Scandalmongering]] can be used to associate a person with a negative event in a false or exaggerated way.

Perhaps the most common form of character assassination is the spread of allegations that a candidate is a liar. Other common themes may include allegations that the candidate is a bad or unpopular member of his family, has a bad relationship with his spouse or children or is not respected by his colleagues.  Another theme claims that the person routinely engages in disturbing, socially unacceptable behavior, such as [[sexual deviancy]]. The person may also be portrayed as holding beliefs widely considered despicable within society, such as supporting [[racism]] or other forms of [[bigotry]].

Charging an opponent with character assassination may have political benefits.  In the [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|hearings for Clarence Thomas' nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States]], supporters claimed that both [[Clarence Thomas]] and [[Anita Hill]] were victims of character assassination.&lt;ref name="isbn0-415-90751-9"&gt;{{cite book
|author1=Walkowitz, Rebecca L. |author2=Garber, Marjorie B. |author3=Matlock, Jann |title=Media spectacles
|publisher=Routledge
|location=New York
|year=1993
|pages=32
|isbn=0-415-90751-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination (ISSCA) specialises in the academic study and research of how character attacks and assassinations have been executed in both history and during contemporary times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://characterattack.files.wordpress.com/|title=Character Assassination|author=|date=|website=Character Assassination|accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Character attacks come in three categories. The first is attacks between equals. These often happen in democracies, especially during elections. The second is top-down attacks, or authoritarian regimes cracking down on individuals.&lt;ref name="IcksShiraev2014"/&gt; Examples include:

* Luther slandered by the Catholic Church during the Reformation
* The {{ill|Gao-Rao affair|zh|高岗饶漱石事件}} in Communist China
* Vaclav Havel slandered in Communist Czechoslovakia

The third is bottom-up attacks, or individuals attacking authoritarian leaders. Examples include:

* Procopius slandering Emperor Justinian in the Secret History
* Protestant reformers slandering the Pope in the 1500s
* Dutch rebels slandering the Duke of Alba during the Dutch Revolt
* The resistance slandering Hitler in Nazi-occupied Europe

==In a totalitarian regime==
The effect of a character assassination driven by an individual is not equal to that of a state-driven campaign.
The state-sponsored destruction of reputations, fostered by political propaganda and cultural mechanisms, can have more far-reaching consequences. One of the earliest signs of a society's compliance to loosening the reins on the perpetration of crimes (and even massacres) with total impunity is when a government favors or directly encourages a campaign aimed at destroying the dignity and reputation of its adversaries, and the public accepts its allegations without question. The mobilisation toward ruining the reputation of adversaries is the prelude to the mobilisation of violence in order to annihilate them. Generally, official dehumanisation has preceded the physical assault of the victims.&lt;ref name="Rojas" /&gt;

==The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination==

In July 2011, scholars from nine countries gathered at the University of Heidelberg, Germany, to debate "the art of smear and defamation in history and today".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://characterattack.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/2011-schedule.pdf|title=Character Assassination: The Art of Defamation Throughout the Ages. International Colloquium Heidelberg July 21st - July 23rd, 2011|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a group to study character assassination throughout the ages. The group included historians, political scientists, and political psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;The International Society for the Study of Character Assassination https://characterattack.wordpress.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Bailey''' (October 27, 1933 – November 25, 2004) was an American actor. Born in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[New Jersey]], he went on to have a lengthy career in theater and television, perhaps his best known role being Dr. Russ Matthews on the long-running daytime soap ''[[Another World (TV series)|Another World]]'' (1973–1978, 1979–1981, 1989, 1992). 

On November 25, 2004, Bailey drowned in the pool at his home in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name=soapcentral&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soapcentral.com/ps/news/2004/1129-bailey.php|title=''Passions Star David Bailey Dead in Pool Accident''|accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was 71 years old.

At the time of his death he had been playing [[Alistair Crane]] on the daytime soap ''[[Passions]]'' for less than three months,&lt;ref name=soapcentral /&gt; to great fan and critical praise. After his death, the role was recast with soap actor [[John Reilly (soap opera actor)|John Reilly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soaps.com/passions/news/1917/Passions_RIP_Alistair_Crane|title=''Passions: RIP Alistair Crane''|accessdate=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Christopher Alder''' was a trainee computer programmer and former [[British Army]] [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|paratrooper]] who had served in the [[Falklands War]] and was commended for his service with the Army in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='We Will Not Give Up Until We Get Justice'|first=Natricia|last=Duncan|date=5 August 2014|work=[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]|location=London|url=http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/we-will-not-give-until-we-get-justice|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police condemned over man's death|date=27 March 2006|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4848238.stm|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wainwright3"&gt;{{Cite news|title='He's right as rain, it's just a show'|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/aug/25/race.world1|accessdate=6 August 2015|location=London|date=25 August 2000|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died while in [[Detention (imprisonment)|police custody]] at Queen's Gardens Police Station, [[Kingston upon Hull]], in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Death in custody police suspended|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=2 May 1998|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case became a [[cause célèbre]] for [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] campaigners in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="hartley"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Judge rejects police officers' claim of juror bias at inquest into former soldier's death|first=Emma|last=Hartley|date=10 April 2001|work=[[The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/judge-rejects-police-officers-claim-of-juror-bias-at-inquest-into-former-soldiers-death-680951.html|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had earlier been the victim of an [[assault]] outside a nightclub and was taken to [[Hull Royal Infirmary]] where, possibly as a result of his head injury, staff said his behaviour was "extremely troublesome."&lt;ref name="wainwright"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Arrest death: 5 suspended|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=30 November 1998|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stokes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mystery of police station death|first=Paul|last=Stokes|date=4 July 2000|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1346514/Mystery-of-police-station-death.html|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt; He was escorted from the hospital by two police officers who arrested him to prevent a [[breach of the peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Death in police cell charges|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=24 July 1999|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On arrival at the police station Alder was "partially dragged and partially carried," [[handcuffs|handcuffed]] and unconscious, from a police van and placed on the floor of the [[custody suite]]. Officers chatted between themselves and speculated that he was faking illness.&lt;ref name="brooke"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police 'thought dying man was playacting'|last=Brooke|first=Chris|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=4 July 2000|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police who chatted as man died|last=Brooke,|first=Chris|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=25 August 2000|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve minutes later one of the officers present noticed that Alder was not making any breathing noises and although [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitation]] was attempted, he was pronounced [[Dead on arrival|dead at the scene]].&lt;ref name="burrell"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police 'thought dying man was play-acting'|first=Ian|last=Burrell|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=4 July 2000|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[autopsy|post mortem]] indicated that the head injury alone would not have killed him.&lt;ref name=brooke/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Death in custody case review|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|location=Birmingham|date=25 August 2000|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was captured on the police station's [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) cameras.&lt;ref name="wainwright2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=CCTV may hold clues to death of black man in custody|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=4 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A coroner's jury in 2000 returned a verdict that Alder was unlawfully killed. In 2002 five police officers went on trial charged with Alder's manslaughter and misconduct in public office, but were acquitted on the orders of the judge. In 2006 an [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] report concluded that four of the officers present in the custody suite when Alder died were guilty of the "most serious neglect of duty". In November 2011 the government formally apologised to Alder's family in the [[European Court of Human Rights]], admitting that it had breached its obligations with regard to "preserving life and ensuring no one is subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment". They also admitted that they had failed to carry out an effective and independent inquiry into the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Government pays out over death of 'wrong body' Falklands veteran Christopher Alder|work=[[The Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christopher Alder==
Christopher Ibikunle Alder (25 June 1960 – 1 April 1998) was a [[Black people|black]] British man of [[Nigeria]]n descent, born in Hull in 1960. He joined the British Army at the age of 16 and served in the Parachute Regiment for six years. After leaving the Army, he first settled in [[Andover, Hampshire|Andover]], [[Hampshire]], before relocating to Dagger Lane, Hull in 1990.&lt;ref name="bhampost"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ex-Para died on floor of police station|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|location=Birmingham|date=4 July 2000|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 he was taking a college course in computer skills in Hull. He had two sons, who had remained with their mother in the Andover area when their parents separated.&lt;ref name="ipcc"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Report, dated 27th February 2006, of the Review into the events leading up to and following the death of Christopher Alder on 1st April 1998|author=[[Independent Police Complaints Commission|IPCC]]|date=27 February 2006|publisher=[[The Stationery Office|TSO]]|isbn=978-0-10-293717-6|location=London|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0506/hc09/0971/0971_i.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events leading to death==

===The Waterfront Club===
At around 7&amp;nbsp;pm on 31 March 1998, Alder went out for the evening in Hull with two friends, visiting several local bars and a fast food restaurant before Alder suggested going on to The Waterfront Club (later renamed The Sugar Mill), a nightclub on Prince's Dock Street in the Old Town area of the city.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. pp.53-54 Statements given to police by John Holdsworth, Benjamin Walkup and Marc Atkinson between 27 April – 8 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; His companions, who later testified that at this stage of the evening Alder had drunk only two pints of [[lager]] and two bottles of [[Beck's Brewery|Beck's beer]] and "seemed sober", declined the invitation. Alder went on alone to the club at around 10.30&amp;nbsp;pm.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.54 Statement given to police by Benjamin Walkup, 8 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; While there he drank a further two or three pints of lager.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.58 Statement given to police by Sarah Williams, 9 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately 1.30&amp;nbsp;am Alder became involved in a disagreement with another customer, Jason Ramm, which led to Ramm's being ejected from the club.&lt;ref name=bhampost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.56 Statement given to police by Jason Ramm, 3 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.58 Statement given to police by Adrian Broadhead, 14 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramm waited in the vicinity of Prince's Dock Street until Alder left the club at 2.15&amp;nbsp;am and another confrontation occurred which was captured on the club's exterior CCTV.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.65 Statement given to police by David Okwesia, 9 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; A third person, Jason Paul, attempted to break up the fight and was struck by Alder.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.67 Statement given to police by Aimun Friegoun, 2 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul retaliated by punching Alder in the face, which caused him to fall backwards, strike his head on the pavement, and lose consciousness.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.69 Statement given to police by Joanne Knapp, 3 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Staff at the nightclub telephoned the emergency services and an ambulance took Alder - who had by this time regained consciousness - to the Hull Royal Infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.72 Statement given to police by Paul Myatt, 1 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two police officers, [[Detective Constable|PC]] Nigel Dawson and PC Neil Blakey, who had arrived shortly after the ambulance in a marked patrol car, made no attempt to speak to Alder. They consulted with the club's manager, who took them inside to review the club's CCTV footage of the incident. A message they sent to their control room at this time indicates that they had already assumed Alder was very drunk, despite not having spoken to him or having been told this by any of the witnesses they spoke with. A third police officer, Acting Police Sergeant (A/PS) Mark Ellerington, arrived at about 2.50&amp;nbsp;am, after the ambulance left, and went inside to speak with the club manager and the officers already present.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. pp.81-83&lt;/ref&gt; He was told by Dawson and Blakey that Alder was drunk. The IPCC report later criticised the stance the police took, saying: "This judgement, based upon very little evidence, tends to suggest that the two officers were making assumptions about Mr. Alder's behaviour, and choosing to attribute it to alcohol taken rather than the injury sustained, from an early stage in their dealings with him."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hull Royal Infirmary===
[[File:Hull Royal Infirmary.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Hull Royal Infirmary.]]
The ambulance arrived at the hospital at 2.44&amp;nbsp;am, where Alder was described by one witness who dealt with him as "confused and dazed" and "generally abusive."&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.85 Statement given to police by David Frankland, 8 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the [[paramedic]]s from the ambulance crew who had transported him there stated that Alder asked: "Where am I? What's happened?"&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.85 Statement given to police by Stephen Krebs, 4 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the nurses who treated him also stated that, in addition to being abusive and swearing at her, he was asking: "Where am I, what am I doing?"&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.86 Statement given to police by Jacqueline Smith, 8 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Two police officers who were present in the [[emergency department]] on an unrelated matter intervened at one point and asked him to cooperate with the nursing staff.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt; They recalled later that he calmed down but remained "confused."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.88 Statement given to police by PC Danielle Rogers, 1 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; PC Dawson and PC Blakey arrived at the hospital at approximately 3.05&amp;nbsp;am. Alder again became uncooperative with staff at the hospital, and the police control room were informed by the officers at 3.19&amp;nbsp;am: "Our complainant is being a wee bit troublesome. Probably the reason why he got [[assault|smacked]] in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.95 Transcript of message logged by Humberside Communications Room 0319hrs 1 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctor who examined Alder listed his injuries as:&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;
*[[Hematoma|haematoma]] at the rear of his head caused by impact but not consistent with a direct blow
*localised swelling to the area of the left side of his upper lip
*two wounds to the left side of his upper lip which were not bleeding
*front left [[canine tooth]] knocked out and the tooth adjacent to it upon the left upper side loosened and pushed into his mouth
*minimal bleeding from the tooth that was knocked out
Medical staff tried to take an [[x-ray]] of Alder's head injury but he would not remain still and they abandoned the effort. PC Dawson wrote in his note book at this time that Alder was "[[Alcohol intoxication|heavily in drink]]" and "typical of people I've seen in the past on [[amphetamine]]."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.96 Extract from PC Dawson's note book.&lt;/ref&gt; Staff eventually decided that they could not administer further treatment to Alder without his cooperation, and the police officers asked if he was well enough to be detained in police custody. The attending doctor agreed that he was.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.98 Statement given to police by Dr. Aamer Khan, 6 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent (2005) [[Healthcare Commission]] report into the medical treatment Alder received described this decision as "flawed...[T]he doctor had yet to make a diagnosis. He was unable to carry out his plan of treatment for Christopher Alder, for example to admit him for observation, x-ray his skull and refer him to a [[Oral and maxillofacial surgery|maxillo-facial surgeon]]. Despite this he decided to discharge him without seeking advice from a senior colleague."&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt; This may also have contributed to the police officers' assumption that Alder's condition was not serious.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt; Alder was forcibly removed from the hospital by PCs Dawson and Blakey, with medical staff stating that he was dragged out by his arms, backwards and with his legs trailing on the floor.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.103 Statements given to police by Dr. Aamer Khan, Carole Walker, Jacqueline Smith, Malcolm Rodgers and Helen Townend, 3–16 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The police officers, however, stated that Alder had walked out unaided although they had kept a gentle grip on him to prevent him falling and to "guide" him.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.104 Statement made during police interview by PC Nigel Dawson, 13 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once outside the hospital, Alder argued with the police officers, who had initially told him to go home, and he was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ex-Para's 'unlawful' death in police cell|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|location=Glasgow|date=25 August 2000|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=exparatrooper/&gt; A/PS Ellerington drove to the hospital to collect Alder for transport to the police station and detention. The vehicle used was a [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] with a caged section in the rear.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.115&lt;/ref&gt; Although handcuffed, a witness would subsequently state that he recalled Alder climbed into the back of the van unassisted.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;

On arrival at the police station following a journey of approximately six minutes, the van doors were opened and the police described Alder being found "asleep" and "snoring."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.123 Statement made during Police interview by A/PS Ellerington, 1 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.129. Statements made by PC Dawson and PC Blakey during Police interviews, 13 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; He was dragged from the van and into the custody suite at 3.46&amp;nbsp;am by PCs Dawson and Blakey, "unresponsive" and with his hands handcuffed behind his back, his legs and feet dragging along the floor and his face just above the ground.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref name="exparatrooper"&gt;{{Cite news|date=24 August 2000|title=Ex-paratrooper's death unlawful|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/894587.stm|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.124&lt;/ref&gt; His trousers and underpants had been pulled down to his knees, possibly by dragging on the floor surface, and one of his shoes had come off.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. pp.124-125&lt;/ref&gt; He had lost control of both [[Urinary incontinence|bladder]] and [[Fecal incontinence|bowels]].&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. pp.138-139&lt;/ref&gt; A/PS Ellerington followed them in. Two police officers, Police Sergeant (PS) John Dunn and PC Matthew Barr, were already present on duty in the custody suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=15 April 2002|title=Police officers 'let man die'|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1930962.stm|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunn was the [[custody officer]] and Barr was the cell warder.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.119&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dawson and Blakey left Alder lying face down on the floor, where the CCTV showed a pool of blood forming around his mouth. One of the officers commented on the blood, but no attempt was made to examine Alder. PS Dunn was heard on the CCTV footage saying that Alder should be taken to the hospital, to which Dawson and Blakey reply that they had just come from there and that they believe Alder is feigning unconsciousness. Dawson said: "This is acting now" and "This is just an acting thing," while Blakey said: "He's right as rain... This is a show, this" and "He kept doing dying swan acts falling off the [hospital] trolley."&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt; A/PS Ellerington also stated later that he believed Alder was "feigning deep sleep."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.135 Statement made by A/PS Ellerington during Police interview, 15 May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; PS Dunn stated that he: "formed the opinion, from what I was told, that the man's behaviour at the present time may be play-acting or attention seeking."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.136 Statement given to Police by PS Dunn, 1 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Hull Central Police Station - geograph.org.uk - 627987.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Queen's Gardens Police Station, Hull.]]
After a few minutes the handcuffs were removed; Alder's arms remained unmoving behind his back, and no attempt was made to examine or rouse him. The officers moved to the opposite side of the counter while a discussion took place about what offences he should be charged with and whether there was any possible justification for holding him, as any potential for breach of peace had clearly passed.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref name=exparatrooper/&gt; Alder could be heard making "gurgling" noises as he breathed in and out through the pool of blood around his face. PS Dunn later explained that although he was aware of the gurgling he ignored it, believing Alder was deliberately blowing through the blood to "try and upset" the officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=16 April 2002|title=Police officers 'could have saved man'|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1933070.stm|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; PC Barr stated later that he had believed the noises "were intended for our attention, in other words he was [[Exaggeration|putting it on]], which fitted neatly into what we had been told by PC Dawson."&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.134 Statement given to Police by PC Matthew Barr, 1 April 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The audio track of the CCTV footage appears to show that the officers made monkey noises, a common form of racist abuse against black people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=26 March 2006|title=Police criticised over custody death|work=[[The Observer]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/26/ameliahill.theobserver|accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 3.57&amp;nbsp;am PC Barr pointed out that Alder was not making any noise and PS Dunn walked around the counter to check him. The officers began resuscitation attempts and called for an ambulance at 3.59&amp;nbsp;am. It arrived at 4.04&amp;nbsp;am, operated by the same crew which had earlier transported Alder from The Waterfront Club to the Hull Royal Infirmary.&lt;ref name="healthcare"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Investigation into the care and treatment given to Christopher Alder by Hull Royal Infirmary and Humberside Ambulance Service NHS Trust prior to his death|date=November 2005|author=[[Healthcare Commission]]|publisher=Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/_db/_documents/inv_christopher_alder.pdf|isbn=978-1-84562-073-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although the crew had been informed that the casualty had "breathing difficulty," the only equipment that they took into the custody suite was a [[bag valve mask]]. The paramedic admitted later that when they had received the call out, he had told his colleague "that it would probably be someone trying to pull a sickie [''ie feigning illness''] to get out of appearing in court in the morning."&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt; He had to return to the ambulance outside to collect the necessary equipment, not returning until another minute had elapsed.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.127 Timings taken from the CCTV footage recovered at the scene.&lt;/ref&gt; The ambulance technician who first examined Alder reported him as having [[Blown pupil|fixed, dilated pupils]], no pulse and not breathing. They eventually ceased [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] at 4.35&amp;nbsp;am.&lt;ref name=healthcare/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IPCC. p.128&lt;/ref&gt;

Alder's clothes were subsequently destroyed by a [[West Yorkshire Police]] team investigating the death and never subjected to forensic examination.&lt;ref name="herbert"/&gt;

==Inquest into death==
At an inquest held in 2000, the jury returned a verdict of [[unlawful killing]].&lt;ref name="stokes2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ex-para in police station was killed unlawfully|last=Stokes|first=Paul|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=25 August 2000|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five police officers who were present in the custody suite at the time were called to give evidence at the inquest, but on more than 150 occasions during the hearing refused to answer questions, citing Coroners Rules that the response could provide [[Self-incrimination|self-incriminating]] evidence.&lt;ref name="herbert"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Filmed to his last gasp, a para's brutal death|last=Herbert|first=Ian|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=25 August 2000|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/law/research/coroners/1984rules.html Coroners Rules 1984, SI 1984 No 552]: "''22 Self-incrimination (1) No witness at an inquest shall be obliged to answer any question tending to incriminate himself. (2) Where it appears to the coroner that a witness has been asked such a question, the coroner shall inform the witness that he may refuse to answer.''"&lt;/ref&gt; They were subsequently charged with [[Malfeasance in office|misconduct in public office]].&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Timeline: The death of Christopher Alder|date=27 March 2006|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-381203/Timeline-The-death-Christopher-Alder.html|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the verdict was returned the officers, backed by the [[Police Federation of England and Wales|Police Federation]], sought to overturn it by means of a [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Inquest challenge|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=8 September 2000|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claimed that the [[coroner]] should not have given a verdict of unlawful killing as an option to the jury, as the breaches of duty alleged against them could not amount to [[gross negligence]].&lt;ref name=ipcc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Move on inquest verdict|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|location=[[Birmingham]]|date=8 September 2000|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also alleged that a female juror had been "infatuated" with the prosecuting [[barrister]] and that there was a "real possibility that her infatuation converted into bias."&lt;ref name="stern"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police probe reveals juror and lawyers night in a hotel|last=Stern|first=Chester|work=[[Mail on Sunday]]|location=London|date=18 March 2001|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eden"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Juror 'infatuated with barrister'|last=Eden|first=Richard|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=6 April 2001|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application for the judicial review was dismissed by the [[High Court of Justice]] in April 2001.&lt;ref name=hartley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bias claim rejected by judge: Police bid to quash killing verdict fails|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|location=Birmingham|date=10 April 2001|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial of police officers==
The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] initially decided that there was insufficient evidence to pursue criminal charges against the officers but, following a review of the medical evidence, the officers were charged in March 2002 with Alder's [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=26 April 2001|title=Policemen avoid death charge|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1317250/News-in-brief.html|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hill2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police criticised over custody death|first=Amelia|last=Hill|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=26 March 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/mar/26/ameliahill.theobserver|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2002, the trial collapsed when the judge ordered the jury to find the officers not guilty on all charges.&lt;ref name="mintowt"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Death police go free: Judge clears officers who laughed and chatted as ex-Para died in custody|last=Mintowt-Czyz|first=Lech|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=22 June 2002|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herbert2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Trial collapses of policemen accused over custody death|first=Ian|last=Herbert|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=22 June 2002|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquittal, an internal police disciplinary inquiry cleared the officers of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=24 June 2003|title=Officers cleared over custody death|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/3017694.stm|accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2003 the [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]] challenged the legal correctness of the officers' acquittals and sent the ruling to the [[Court of Appeal]] "to clarify the threshold for evidence in future death-in-custody cases," although this would not affect the acquittal because of the principle of "[[double jeopardy]]," which applied at that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=17 July 2003|title=Custody death family's legal boost|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/3073529.stm|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gibb"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Reforming the rules of death|last=Gibb|first=Frances|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=22 July 2003|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, [[BBC television]] series ''[[Rough Justice (British TV series)|Rough Justice]]'' broadcast "Death On Camera", a programme examining the circumstances of Alder's death, including the CCTV footage from the custody suite which had previously not been seen by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Broadcast and be damned: the death and the abortion we should not be spared|first=Andreas|last=Whittam Smith|date=18 April 2004|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/television-broadcast-and-be-damned-the-death-and-the-abortion-we-should-not-be-spared-560260.html|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=TV to show death under eyes of police: Sister seeks public inquiry over video footage of man choking on his own blood|last=Hill|first=Amelia|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date=11 April 2004|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cowan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=TV to show dying minutes of man in custody: Family backs broadcast of CCTV footage revealing how ex-paratrooper choked on the floor as police did nothing to help|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=14 April 2004|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the programme and the public concern it raised, [[Home Secretary]] [[David Blunkett]] asked the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) to review the case.&lt;ref name="cowan2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Blunkett acts over police station death|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 April 2004|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herbert3"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Blunkett demands inquiry into death of black man in custody|first=Ian|last=Herbert|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=15 April 2004|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004 four of the five police officers were granted early retirement on stress-related medical grounds and received lump-sum compensation payments of between [[Pound sterling|£]]44,000 and £66,000 as well as pensions.&lt;ref name="brooke2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police officers who laughed as man died get £1/2m pensions|last=Brooke|first=Chris|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=24 December 2004|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wainwright5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police involved in death inquiry retire|last=Wainwright|first=Martin|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=24 December 2004|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="herbert6"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Outrage as unlawful killing officers receive pay-offs|first=Ian|last=Herbert|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=30 December 2004|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The officers all declined requests to take part in the IPCC inquiry.&lt;ref name=ipcc/&gt; In March 2006 the IPCC chairman, Nick Hardwick, said the officers present when Alder died were guilty of the "most serious neglect of duty" amounting to "unwitting racism."&lt;ref name=ipcc/&gt;&lt;ref name="gill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Left to die by 'racist police'|last1=Gill|first1=Charlotte|last2=Slack|first2=James|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|date=28 March 2006|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cowan3"&gt;{{Cite news|title='Racist' police officers laughed as man lay dying: Five condemned over ex-paratrooper's death|first=Rosie|last=Cowan|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=28 March 2006|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In September 2006 Leon Wilson, one of Alder's sons, went to the High Court to challenge the Home Office's refusal to reopen the case. The judge rejected his case, saying it was "legally reasonable for the [[Secretary of State]] to believe that no more worthwhile evidence was likely to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Death in custody inquiry plea is rejected by judge|work=[[Hull Daily Mail]]|location=Kingston upon Hull|date=15 September 2006|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alder family loses plea over death in custody|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=15 September 2006|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil case arising from investigation==
In January 2006, a civil jury also found that a man had been unlawfully arrested and charged with Alder's assault on the night he died "to divert attention away from the part the police themselves played in Mr Alder's death."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=27 January 2006|title=Man cleared over custody death|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/humber/4656112.stm|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=27 March 2006|title=Long shadow of a custody death|first=Cindi|last=John|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4849210.stm|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Damages paid to man cleared in custody death case|first=Bianca Brigitte|last=Bonomi|date=7 February 2006|work=[[Institute of Race Relations]]|url=http://www.irr.org.uk/2006/february/ha000011.html|accessdate=8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Burial==
In November 2011 Alder's body was discovered in the mortuary at Hull Royal Infirmary, eleven years after his family believed they had buried him. An exhumation of his grave in Hull's Northern Cemetery during the night of 21 February 2012 found that Grace Kamara, a 77-year-old woman, had been buried in his place. South Yorkshire Police Detective Superintendent Richard Fewkes announced that a criminal investigation had begun to determine if an offence of misconduct in public office had been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Criminal investigation after mortuary bodies mix-up|work=[[Hull Daily Mail]]|location=Hull|date=26 March 2012|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-15611194 |title=Christopher Alder death: Body mix-up claim probed |work=[[BBC News]]|date=6 November 2011 |accessdate=6 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=7 May 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-17981314|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Grace Kamara body: New funeral for woman buried in wrong grave|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deaths in police custody==
Alder was one of 69 suspects who died in police custody in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Figures behind the distrust|last=Kennedy|first=Dominic|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=30 January 1999|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1990 and 2011, 980 people died in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Deaths in police custody|publisher=[[INQUEST]]|url=http://inquest.gn.apc.org/website/statistics/deaths-in-police-custody|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one police officer has ever been convicted for such a death, although prosecutions were recommended against 13 officers based on "relatively strong evidence of misconduct or neglect".&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Deaths in police custody since 1998: 333; officers convicted: none|first=Caroline|last=Davies|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/03/deaths-police-custody-officers-convicted|date=3 December 2010|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful prosecution related to the death of Craig Boyd in March 2004. Boyd hung himself with a shoelace in his cell at St Mary's Wharf police station, [[Derby]]. PC David Stoll, the custody suite warden, was watching the Disney film ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' with two other officers at the time; custody records were falsified to show visits by officers to the cells "that were not substantiated by video evidence." Stoll was found guilty of misconduct in a public office and was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, suspended for one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hanged suspect feared return to jail|date=23 June 2009|work=This Is Debyshire|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|url=http://www.thisisderbyshire.co.uk/Father-s-death-led-decline/story-11614035-detail/story.html|accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Custody death trial|work=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=16 March 2007|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Father was found hanged in police custody cell|work=[[Derby Evening Telegraph]]|location=Derby|date=9 July 2009|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Judge [[Gerald Butler]] criticised the Crown Prosecution Service for failing to take action over a number of deaths in police custody. He made several recommendations to improve accountability and expressed "unease" over the current system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=11 August 1999|title=CPS criticised over custody deaths|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=12 May 2012|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/417079.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2010 report the IPCC suggested that juries were "unwilling to convict police officers." The report, which covered deaths in custody in England and Wales between 1998 and 2010, concluded that in 16 cases restraint by officers was the direct cause of death, of which four were classed as "positional asphyxia." The majority of deaths were ruled as occurring due to natural causes, many involving drug or alcohol abuse, and the authors called on the [[Home Office]] and [[Department of Health]] "to pilot facilities with medical care to replace police cells." Deborah Coles, co-director of the charity and campaign group [[INQUEST]] said: "The study points to alarming failures in the care of vulnerable detainees suffering from mental health, drug and alcohol problems, many of whom should have been diverted from police custody."&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt; 

According to the report "fewer than half of detainees booked into custody who should have been risk assessed were actually assessed," while "incidents where custody officers had not conducted proper checks, or thoroughly roused detainees to check their state, were prevalent." Custody officers and staff also lacked basic first aid training. Mike Franklin, the IPCC commissioner, said: "What emerges most prominently from the report is the medical and mental health needs of a large number of people the police arrest," and questioned whether custody "is the best place for a large number of the people the police deal with."&lt;ref name=Davies/&gt;

On 1 September 2011 the [[Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007]] was extended to include all deaths in police custody suites, prison cells, mental health detention facilities and [[Young Offenders Institution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Corporate homicide law extended to prisons and police cells|first=Sandra|last=Laville|date=28 August 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|accessdate=12 May 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/28/corporate-homicide-law-prison-police}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Demon's Souls'''''{{efn|{{Nihongo|デモンズソウル|Demonzu Souru|lead=yes}}}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] for the [[PlayStation 3]]. It was published in Japan by [[Sony Computer Entertainment]] in February 2009, in North America by [[Atlus USA]] in October 2009, and in Australia and Europe by [[Namco Bandai Games]] in June 2010. It was the first installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series of games created by game director [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]] and was produced under supervision by [[SIE Japan Studio|Sony's Japan Studio]].

Set in a [[dark fantasy]] world, players take control of a hero who has journeyed to the fictional kingdom of Boletaria, which is being ravaged by a cursed fog that brings forth demons who feast on the souls of mortals. The game was described as a [[spiritual successor]] to the ''[[King's Field (series)|King's Field]]'' series of games, while at the same time being described as a separate entity from it. The gameplay involves a character-creation system and emphasizes gathering loot through combat with enemies in a non-linear series of varied locations, with a heavy emphasis on challenging combat. It has a unique online multiplayer system integrated into the single-player where players can leave useful messages and warnings for other players' single-player game worlds, as well as joining other players in their world to assist and/or kill them.

Upon its release, ''Demon's Souls'' was met with acclaim from critics, winning numerous awards. The game was praised for its dark fantasy art design, variation in combat choice and integrated online interactions, and its high [[difficulty level]], with many critics noting it as a genuine challenge. The game ''[[Dark Souls]]'', which itself spawned two sequels, is a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Demon's Souls'', and was also one of the primary inspirations for ''[[Bloodborne]]''.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Demon Souls Screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|The player confronting a red dragon. The light tint around the player character indicates that they have previously died resulting in a reduced health bar and stronger foes]]

Players take control of the main character who, at the start of the game, can be customized by choice of gender, appearance, name and starting class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 starting classes, ranging from knights and barbarians to thieves and mages. Each class has its own starting statistics, gear, weapons and type of magic used which all emphasize certain approaches to combat depending on the player's preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As players kill demons, they gain souls which act as currency that can be used to buy, repair, and upgrade weapons as well as increase player statistics such as strength, luck, and endurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with souls, players can retrieve items such as weaponry and ore for upgrading. When a player is killed during a level, they are sent to the beginning of the level with all non-[[boss (video game)|boss]] enemies re-spawned, and the player returns in soul form with lower maximum health and the loss of all unused souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the player manages to reach their bloodstain at the point where they were last killed, they regain their lost souls. However, if they are killed before then, the souls are lost permanently. Upon defeating a boss, the player can choose to re-spawn back to that location, marked in the form of an Archstone. When not exploring a level, players reside in the Nexus, a realm of souls that acts as a hub where players can exchange souls, store items and travel between regions. After completing the initial portion of the first region, players can choose to progress through any other of the newly available regions.&lt;ref name="GSReview"/&gt;

Gameplay can change depending on both the World and Character tendency, which can be either white or black. Tendency depends on the actions of the player such as helping or killing [[non-player character|NPCs]]. When white, enemies are easier, yet the soul and items rewards are fewer; when black, enemies are stronger and give greater rewards. Players can manipulate their tendency to suit their current needs. Character tendency affects the player throughout, while World Tendency only affects the region where an action was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further emphasizing the challenging nature of the game is the increased difficulty upon [[New Game Plus|completion of the story]]. After finishing the game, the player may choose to continue playing from the beginning, except with a 40% increase in difficulty. Subsequent completions increase the difficulty further by 8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/newgame-plus|title=Newgame Plus|accessdate=2010-10-07|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808124137/http://demonssouls.wikidot.com/newgame-plus|archivedate=2010-08-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online ===
When connected to the [[PlayStation Network]], online play is integrated into the single-player experience. Throughout levels, players can briefly see the actions of other players as ghosts in the same area that may show hidden passages or switches. When a player dies, a bloodstain can be left in other players' game world that when activated can show a ghost playing out their final moments, indicating how that person died and potentially helping the player avoid the same fate in advance. Players can leave messages on the floor that can also help others such as forewarning safe or hostile positions, trap locations and tactics against enemies or bosses, among general comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-operative play allows up to three characters to team up in the host's game world where visiting players appear in soul form that can only be returned to their bodies when a boss is defeated. In competitive play, players can invade a player's adventure as a Black Phantom to engage in combat with the host player. If the Black Phantom kills the host, they can be returned to their body in their own game, whereas if killed themselves, the host gains a portion of the Black Phantom's souls as well as the phantom losing a player level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2009 | editor=Atlus | title=Demon's Souls game manual (North American) | publisher=Atlus | pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The game is set in a kingdom called Boletaria, ruled by the aging King Allant XII. Because of his greed, the king began to channel the power of souls, bringing unprecedented prosperity to Boletaria, until the "Deep Fog" covered the land's outskirts, cutting off the kingdom from the outside world. Neighboring kingdoms sent scouts to investigate but none returned after entering the fog.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' King Allant the twelfth, by channeling the power of souls brought unprecedented prosperity to his northern kingdom of Boletaria. That is until the colorless Deep Fog swept across the land. Boletaria was cut off from the outside world, and those who dared penetrate the Deep Fog never returned. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only after Vallarfax of the royal Twin Fangs broke free from the fog that the rest of the world could be told of Boletaria's plight. By channeling souls, King Allant had awakened the [[Old One in fiction#Demon.27s Souls|Old One]], a great demon residing below the Nexus. This created the fog, and unleashed more demons within it that feasted on the souls of mankind, while those left alive without a soul became insane and violent. Without resistance, the fog slowly begins to spread beyond Boletaria.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' But Vallarfax of the royal Twin Fangs broke free from the fog and told the world of Boletaria's plight. That the Old King Allant had aroused the Old One, the great beast below the Nexus, from its eternal slumber. And that a colorless fog had swept in, unleashing terrible demons. The demons hunt down men and claim their souls. Those who lose their souls, also lose their minds. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Maiden in Black and Old One.jpg|right|thumb|The Maiden in Black beckons to the Old One]]
Many brave warriors attempted to breach the fog and save Boletaria, while others were tempted by the prospect of harnessing the demon's souls; either way, many were lost to the fog.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' ...the power of a mature demon's soul is beyond human imagination. The legend spread quickly. Mighty warriors were drawn to the cursed land but none have returned. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player takes control of one such warrior who breaches the fog and enters the lost kingdom;&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' But Boletaria has one final hope. A lone warrior who has braved the baneful fog. Has the land found its savior, or have the demons found a new slave? {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, after entering the palace botanical gardens, the protagonist is confronted by a vile demon, The Vanguard. If the protagonist manages to defeat the Vanguard, they are killed by the Dragon God, another massive demon with a draconic form. After dying, the protagonist, now in soul form, appears in the Nexus. In the Nexus, they are greeted by the Maiden in Black, a mysterious and blinded matron of the Nexus who gives them the quest to travel to each region of Boletaria and retrieve the demon's souls to gain power and eventually free the corrupt kingdom of Boletaria from the Old One.&lt;ref&gt;'''Maiden in Black:''' Souls of the lost withdrawn from its vessel. Let strength be grant so the world might be mended... so the world might be mended. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One by one the protagonist slays the mighty demons, some of whom are the corrupt forms of Boletaria's heroic Round Table knights, that reside in many of Boletaria's notable locations; the Boletarian Palace, Stonefang Tunnel, Tower of Latria, Shrine of Storms, and Valley of Defilement. It is also in these places where they encounter the few remaining great men and women of Boletaria. Once the protagonist claims all the demon's souls and has killed the Arch Demons of each area, the Maiden in Black leads them down below the Nexus to the Old One itself. The Maiden in Black beckons the Old One, who invites the protagonist inside where the now-deformed King Allant XII remains.&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' You have been chosen by the Old One. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the final battle Allant claims that because of humanity's own violence and suffering, the Old One is acting mercifully by putting "an end to our tragic realm of existence."&lt;ref&gt;'''King Allant:''' Surely you have seen for yourself the pain and suffering that fills this world!  But fight poison with poison.. God is merciful, and so, created the Old One. The Old One will feed upon our souls, and put an end to our tragic realm of existence! {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Allant's defeat, his last words are a warning to the protagonist: "You fool. Don't you understand? No one wishes to go on."

During the end of the game the protagonist makes one last choice either to slay or to walk away from the Maiden in Black. If the protagonist walks away, they have not succumbed to the temptation of the souls. The fog is lifted and the Maiden departs with the Old One back into the fog into its slumber once again, saving Boletaria and the rest of the world, although the souls consumed remain lost for eternity.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' The Old One, along with the maiden, were swept back into the lulling fog. Boletaria was spared from the demons, but also lost its knowledge of soul arts. The souls lost during the pandemonium were never retrieved. {{cite video game|title=Demon's Souls |developer=From Software |publisher=Atlus |date=2009-10-06 |platform=PlayStation 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; If, however, the Maiden in Black is killed, they have become lustful for the power of souls, condemning the world with the protagonist as its ruler at the side of the Old One.&lt;ref&gt;'''Narrator:''' The Old One sensed a new and powerful demon by its side.

== Development ==

Prior to Miyazaki stepping in, the project was internally considered a failure, with the team being unable to create a compelling prototype. Miyazaki, who up until then had only worked on the ''[[Armored Core]]'' series, eventually took full control of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-01-demons-souls-was-a-failure-before-miyazaki-stepped-up |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170213164931/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-04-01-demons-souls-was-a-failure-before-miyazaki-stepped-up |archivedate=2017-02-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He "changed pretty much everything about" the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.destructoid.com/ico-showed-bloodborne-s-hidetaka-miyazaki-the-possibilities-of-the-medium--289853.phtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214002347/https://www.destructoid.com/ico-showed-bloodborne-s-hidetaka-miyazaki-the-possibilities-of-the-medium--289853.phtml |archivedate=2017-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making it a separate entity from ''King's Field'', with a different perspective and "guided by differing core game design concepts."&lt;ref name="RollingStone"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mielke|first1=James|title='Dark Souls' Creator Miyazaki on 'Zelda,' Sequels and Starting Out|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/dark-souls-creator-miyazaki-on-zelda-sequels-w443435|website=Rolling Stone|accessdate=6 October 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005123700/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/dark-souls-creator-miyazaki-on-zelda-sequels-w443435|archivedate=5 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not consider it a "successor" to ''King's Field'', stating that, while "''King's Field'' was the beginning of the ''Demon's Souls'' project, I wouldn't go as far as to say that we had ''King's Field'' in mind while we were making ''Demon's Souls''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor?page=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-02-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170524095629/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor?page=2 |archivedate=2017-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyazaki commented on the game's considerable difficulty as "never the goal", but rather a focus on creating a real sense of accomplishment. Difficulty was described as "one way to offer an intense sense of accomplishment through forming strategies, overcoming obstacles, and discovering new things."&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Game locations were described as "places of evil intent", such as the Tower of Latria embodying man-made evil, and the Valley of Defilement embodying natural evil, with the difficulty heightening the player's sense of dread.&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; The threat of death that sees players potentially losing all their hard-earned souls was also created to emphasize this mood, that "if the Souls could be recovered anytime, there would be no suspense or sense of accomplishment." Boss battles were primarily designed to be "varied and exciting" to make sure "players didn’t get tired of the same fight" and like the rest of the game "encourage them to figure out different tactics, to think on their feet."&lt;ref name="GIinterview"/&gt; Takeshi Kajii felt that the boss battles were not the hardest element; "You say boss, but it’s not just the boss. It’s everything including the road up to the boss that makes this game really hard. If you find patterns to destroy the boss, it’s not that hard. It’s how you get to the boss that makes this a difficult game."&lt;ref name="siliconerainterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2009/07/10/demons-souls-director-didnt-think-demons-souls-was-that-hard/|title=Demon’s Souls Director Didn’t Think Demon’s Souls Was *That* Hard|publisher=Siliconera.com|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2009-07-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713072612/http://www.siliconera.com/2009/07/10/demons-souls-director-didnt-think-demons-souls-was-that-hard/|archivedate=2009-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyazaki said that the game's [[Balance (game design)|difficulty]] was inspired by the [[trial and error]] difficulty of [[Retrogaming|retro video games]].&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacDonald|first1=Keza|title=Souls Survivor|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor|website=Eurogamer|accessdate=21 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319020959/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/souls-survivor|archivedate=19 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When developing the integrated online feature, Miyazaki felt many new games had what he considered "too much communication in online games which can become a burden for some people," instead integrating the online experience subtly, with certain online elements like the ghostly figures of other human players adding to the dark mood of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ps3hyper.com/news/demons-souls-director-i-wanted-it-to-be-easier-no-plans-for-sequel-yet/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421171858/http://www.ps3hyper.com/news/demons-souls-director-i-wanted-it-to-be-easier-no-plans-for-sequel-yet/ |archivedate=2009-04-21 |title=Demon’s Souls Director: "I Wanted It To Be Easier", No Plans For Sequel Yet|publisher=PS3Hyper|date=2009-04-20|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When implementing the system of allowing players to leave useful messages, instead of allowing players to write a message, a list of pre-written messages was chosen; not only to make the process quick and easy to use since players cannot pause gameplay, but also was to prevent the system from becoming "a large chat, which detracts from the feel of the world."&lt;ref name="siliconerainterview"/&gt;

The game's asynchronous multiplayer system was inspired by a personal experience by Miyazaki, where a car in front of him had stopped on an icy hillside and began to slide downward.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; The car following Miyazaki also began to slide, with the one behind it helping to push the cars up the hill, which then Miyazaki and others also successfully did.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Unable to give his appreciation to the drivers before leaving the area, he wondered whether the last person in the line had made it to their destination, thinking that he would probably never meet the people again.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Miyazaki called the experience a "connection of mutual assistance between transient people", which then heavily inspired the game's use of cooperation between players who do not directly communicate.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; The concepts of an in-game messaging system, shared play experience, and mutual role-playing were inspired by [[text messaging]] and [[retro gaming]], particularly the early ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' games.&lt;ref name="dq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/08/dark-souls-online-play-to-bring-back-the-feeling-of-old-dragon-quest-games/|title=Dark Souls online play to bring back the feeling of old Dragon Quest games|work=VG247.com|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630185933/http://www.vg247.com/2011/02/08/dark-souls-online-play-to-bring-back-the-feeling-of-old-dragon-quest-games/|archivedate=30 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt; Wanting to remove the ease of communication, Miyazaki explained that everyone was forced to work together when gaming up in the 1980s to help each other due to the lack of easily accessible information at the time, a process he was a fan of.&lt;ref name="Souls Survivor"/&gt;

The game's approach to storytelling was inspired by Miyazaki's experiences of attempting to understand English books he could not read. Because he could not read English, he created his own stories by interpreting what was in the pictures. This inspired him to make a game where players don't understand what's going on, and must interpret things as they play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="It Has to Be Personal" Says 'God of War' Creative Director Cory Barlog|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/glixel/features/it-has-to-be-personal-says-god-of-war-creative-director-cory-barlog-w488948|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the game's Asian release and positive reception, in May Atlus announced plans to publish ''Demon's Souls'' in North America, promoting the game at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]] (E3) before eventually being released in North America on October 7 that year. The North American version runs on separate online servers, with players of that version not being able to interact with people playing on other regional versions. The same applies to saved games and trophy sets; saves from Asian versions will not work with the North American version,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/07/06/playstation-eye-chat-demons-souls|title=PlayStation Eye Chat: Demon’s Souls|website=Official PlayStation.Blog|author=Jeff Rubenstein|publisher=Sony|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lgot9E?url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2009/07/06/playstation-eye-chat-demons-souls/|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a separate trophy list is installed from the Asian releases, despite the trophy content being identical.

Regarding a possible European release, [[Eurogamer]] contacted Atlus USA over the matter where their spokesperson Aram Jabbari gave the statement "I'm not aware of any plans/publishers for bringing the game to Europe at this time. Hopefully the game continues to generate word of mouth and positive critical reception and a European publisher takes notice."

== Merchandise and other media ==
Upon its release in North America, ''Demon's Souls'' was also released with a Deluxe Edition in a slipcase, along with a 150-page guide book. Prior to the game's release, at the time pre-orders from [[GameStop]] for either the standard or Deluxe version included an official soundtrack disc and art book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5308286/demon-souls-dated-and-bundled-with-swag|title=Demon Souls Dated And Bundled With Swag|author=Mike Fahey|publisher=Kotaku|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2010-03-08|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206145758/http://kotaku.com/5308286/demon-souls-dated-and-bundled-with-swag|archivedate=2010-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some copies of the strategy guide however were reported to have "unusual cover ink wear/fading". Having realized this mistake, Atlus responded by launching a temporary replacement program for defect copies on their official website, along with an apology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61230|title=Atlus Launches Demon's Souls Strategy Guide Replacement Program|author=Chris Faylor|publisher=Shack News|date=2009-11-12|accessdate=2010-09-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923050122/http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/61230|archivedate=2010-09-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a special edition was released in Europe called ''Demon's Souls: Black Phantom Edition''. Like the North American Deluxe Edition, it contains an art book, soundtrack CD and strategy guide.&lt;ref name="officialeurorelease"/&gt; The strategy guide part of the Black Edition was put together by Namco Bandai Games for no additional production costs with the help of the editors of the fan supported Demon's Souls Wiki hosted by [[Wikidot]], which supported information on each aspect of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5520094/demons-souls-pal-release-has-fan+made-strategy-guide|title=Demon's Souls PAL Release Has Fan-Made Strategy Guide|author=Luke Plunkett|publisher=Kotaku|date=2010-04-19|accessdate=2010-06-25|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528162208/http://kotaku.com/5520094/demons-souls-pal-release-has-fan+made-strategy-guide|archivedate=2010-05-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release in Japan, ''Demon's Souls'' was generally well received by critics. ''[[ASCII Media Works|Dengeki]]'' scored the game 95/85/85/85, adding up to 350 out of 400, saying that "fans of old-school games will shed tears of joy." ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it 29 out of 40 (9/7/7/6), with an editor Paint Yamamoto scoring it a 9 and calling it "a game you learn how to play by losing – you'll face sudden death frequently. But! Keep playing... and you'll realize how deep it really is." However, another editor, Maria Kichiji, gave it a 6 and found the game to be "far too stoic... it's not a game for everybody."&lt;ref name="Dengeki and Famitsu Scores"&gt;{{cite web |first= Nick |last= Des Barres |title= Japan Review Check: Demon's Souls |url= http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172516 |archive-url= http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160522222939/http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172516 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2016-05-22 |date= 2009-01-28 |publisher= [[1UP.com]] |accessdate= 2010-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon release in North America, the game received critical acclaim with an average critic score of {{Video game review score|reviewer=mc|system=PS3|proseScore=yes}} at [[Metacritic]]. Despite the game's high difficulty, many reviewers found it to be a positive aspect, making the game more rewarding to play. [[GameSpot]] called the high difficulty "fair", saying players will "undoubtedly take a lot of damage until you learn the subtleties of fighting each enemy, but combat feels just right."&lt;ref name="GSReview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/rpg/demonssoul/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary;read-review |title=GameSpot Demon’s Souls Review – Brutally challenging and utterly engrossing, this innovative role-playing game is one of the year's best. |publisher=GameSpot |author=Kevin VanOrd |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2010-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105034921/http://uk.gamespot.com/ps3/rpg/demonssoul/review.html?om_act=convert&amp;om_clk=gssummary&amp;tag=summary%3Bread-review |archivedate=2010-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] echoed this view, encouraging players who "can remember the good ol' days when games taught through the highly effective use of negative reinforcement and a heavy price for not playing it carefully should scoop this up instantly."&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1033437p1.html|title=IGN Demon’s Souls Review – One of the most rewarding, challenging PS3 games finally hits the US.|publisher=IGN|author=Sam Bishop|date=2009-10-09|accessdate=2010-01-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679lwjqgr?url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/103/1033437p1.html|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Game Informer]]'' called it "one of the first truly great Japanese RPGs of this generation, and certainly the most remarkable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/20/review.aspx|title=Game Informer Demon’s Souls Review – From Software Gives RPG Players Tough Love|publisher=Game Informer|author=Phil Kollar|date=2009-10-20|accessdate=2010-01-28|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/679m1dNOg?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/demons_souls/b/ps3/archive/2009/10/20/review.aspx|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' however, while commending the game overall, said ''Demon's Souls'' was "best left to the most masochistic, hardcore gamer."&lt;ref name="OPMReview"&gt;{{cite journal | date=December 2009|title=PlayStation: The Official Magazine (US) Demon's Souls|publisher=PlayStation: The Official Magazine|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the game's release in Europe, European critics reviewed import copies.

''Demon's Souls'' favorable review scores made the fiscal performance of the game unique because of the lack of a supporting marketing campaign. Gaming analyst [[Jesse Divnich]] commented "''Demon's Souls'' is probably one of the most statistically relevant games released in the gaming world as it helps answer an often asked question: how much would a high quality game sell if it was supported by no mass marketing, released by a little known publisher, and was a new intellectual property."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Analysts predict cold October for game industry |url= http://www.gamespot.com/articles/analysts-predict-cold-october-for-game-industry/1100-6239455/ |author= Tom Magrino |date= November 10, 2009 |accessdate= October 31, 2016 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20171130091505/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/analysts-predict-cold-october-for-game-industry/1100-6239455/ |archivedate= November 30, 2017 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the critical and commercial success of the game, Sony Computer Entertainment VP of international software Yeonkyung Kim later admitted that it was a "mistake" to pass on the game, instead allowing Atlus to publish it, initially due to concerns over its difficulty and unusual design decisions.&lt;ref name="2010sales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.index-hd.com/up_images_m/files/20100412.pdf |script-title=ja:2010年8月期中間決算説明会 |publisher=Index Holdings |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2010-08-02 |format=PDF |language=ja |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024622/http://www.index-hd.com/up_images_m/files/20100412.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[General (United States)|General]] '''Edwin William Rawlings''', [[USAF]] (Ret), (September 11, 1904 &amp;ndash; December 8, 1997) was a leading figure in the administrative development of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF).

==Early life==
A [[Milroy, Minnesota]] native, Rawlings graduated with an economics degree from [[Hamline University]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]]. He became a flying [[cadet]] in February 1929. Almost 25 years to the day later, he became one of the USAF's youngest generals, confirmed for a fourth star at 49. He had also by then earned an [[MBA]] from [[Harvard University]].

==Air comptroller pioneer==
In November 1946, Symington named Rawlings as air comptroller, helping to organize the office. The position was so successful and struck such a note, the United States adopted the idea of a comptroller for all three services.

In 1951, Rawlings became commander of [[Air Materiel Command]] at [[Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio]], leading USAF's procurement and logistics efforts for seven years. Air Force Chief of Staff [[Thomas D. White]] credited him with spectacular increases in the effectiveness of the Air Force logistics, accomplished through new management methods, concepts, and philosophy, and thus the Air Force has been able to match the tempo of the jet, missile, and space era.

Rawlings was a command pilot and combat and aircraft observer, whose decorations included the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]] and [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], which he received in 1930 for his role in the rescue of an aircrew downed in the Pacific. He also received the [[Soldier's Medal]] in 1954 for rescuing his pilot who was lying underneath a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] that caught fire after landing at Wright-Patterson.

==Later life==
After retiring from USAF in 1959, he went on to a career with [[General Mills]], rising to become president and board chairman. During his second career, General Rawlings introduced [[corporate social responsibility]] and adapted the [[Delphi method]] for corporate strategic planning.

In 1997, Rawlings died in [[Auburn, Washington]] at age 93.

==Legacy==
In 1981 the [[Air Force Association]] (AFA) and AEF in 1981 established the Gen.. Edwin W. Rawlings Award initially to recognize [[energy conservation]] achievements within USAF. Now the award recognizes and outstanding technician or manager in [[Environmentalism|environmental]] matters.

The AFA's Gen. E. W. Rawlings Chapter was chartered in Saint Paul in August 1982.

[[Eugene M. Zuckert]], [[Secretary of the Air Force]] from 1961 to 1965, credits Rawlings with building a "mature, business-like" image for the newly established Air Force. Zuckert said Air Force Secretary [[Stuart Symington]] asked him in 1945 why he had to "send out a search party" whenever he needed Army Air Forces statistics, Zuckert remembered a Rawlings memo suggesting the creation of a comptroller position and passed the idea on to Symington. According to Zuckert, the methods developed by Rawlings  constituted "a very important step in the development of a postwar Air Force."

'''Emerging technologies''' are technologies that are perceived as capable of changing the status quo. These technologies are generally new but include older technologies that are still controversial and relatively undeveloped in potential, such as [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] and [[gene therapy]] which date to 1989 and 1990 respectively.

Emerging technologies are characterized by radical novelty, relatively fast growth, coherence, prominent impact, and uncertainty and ambiguity. In other words, an emerging technology can be defined as "a radically novel and relatively fast growing technology characterised by a certain degree of coherence persisting over time and with the potential to exert a considerable impact on the socio-economic domain(s) which is observed in terms of the composition of actors, institutions and patterns of interactions among those, along with the associated knowledge production processes. Its most prominent impact, however, lies in the future and so in the emergence phase is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous.".&lt;ref&gt;Rotolo, D., Hicks, D., Martin, B. R. (2015) What is an emerging technology? Research Policy 44(10): 1827–1843. Available [https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2564094 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emerging technologies include a variety of technologies such as [[educational technology]], [[information technology]], [[nanotechnology]], [[biotechnology]], [[cognitive science]], psychotechnology, [[robotics]], and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;other examples of developments described as "emerging technologies" can be found [http://conferences.oreillynet.com/pub/w/18/keynotes.html here] – O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference 2008 .&lt;/ref&gt;

New technological fields may result from the [[technological convergence]] of different systems evolving towards similar goals. Convergence brings previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video together so that they share resources and interact with each other, creating new efficiencies.

Emerging technologies are those technical innovations which represent progressive developments within a field for [[economic competition|competitive advantage]];&lt;ref&gt;International Congress Innovation and Technology XXI: Strategies and Policies Towards the XXI Century, &amp; Soares, O. D. D. (1997). Innovation and technology: Strategies and policies. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; converging technologies represent previously distinct fields which are in some way moving towards stronger inter-connection and similar goals. However, the opinion on the degree of the impact, status and economic viability of several emerging and converging technologies.

== History of emerging technologies==
{{main|History of technology}}
In the [[history of technology]], emerging technologies&lt;ref&gt;Emerging Technologies: From Hindsight to Foresight. Edited by Edna F. Einsiedel. UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emerging technologies: where is the federal government on the high tech curve? : hearing before the Subcommittee on Government Management, Information, and Technology of the Committee on Government Reform, House of Representatives, One Hundred Sixth Congress, second session, April 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; are contemporary advances and innovation in various fields of [[technology]].

Over centuries innovative methods and new technologies are developed and opened up. Some of these technologies are due to theoretical research, and others from commercial [[research and development]].

Technological growth includes incremental developments and [[disruptive technology|disruptive technologies]]. An example of the former was the gradual roll-out of [[DVD]] (digital video disc) as a development intended to follow on from the previous optical technology [[compact disc]]. By contrast, disruptive technologies are those where a new method replaces the previous technology and makes it redundant, for example, the replacement of horse-drawn carriages by automobiles and other vehicles.

== Emerging technology debates  ==
{{see also|Technology and society}}
Many writers, including [[computer scientist]] [[Bill Joy]],&lt;ref&gt;See: ''[[Wired Magazine]]'', "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]",&lt;/ref&gt; have identified clusters of  technologies that they consider critical to humanity's future. Joy warns that the technology could be used by elites for [[Good and evil|good]] or [[evil]]. They could use it as "good shepherds" for the rest of humanity, or decide everyone else is superfluous and push for mass extinction of those made unnecessary by technology.&lt;ref name="Joy 2000"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Joy, Bill| author-link = Bill Joy | title = Why the future doesn't need us | date = 2000 | url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html| accessdate=2005-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advocates of the benefits of [[technological change]] typically see emerging and converging technologies as offering hope for the betterment of the [[human condition]]. Cyberphilosophers [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]] argue in ''The Futurica Trilogy'' that while Man himself is basically constant throughout human history ([[Genetics|genes]] change very slowly), all relevant change is rather a direct or indirect result of technological innovation ([[Memetics|memes]] change very fast) since new ideas always emanate from technology use and not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|asin=9187173247|title=The Futurica Trilogy|first1=Alexander|last1=Bard|first2=Jan|last2=Söderqvist|date=8 May 2012|publisher=Stockholm Text}}&lt;/ref&gt; Man should consequently be regarded as history's main constant and technology as its main variable. However, critics of the risks of technological change, and even some advocates such as [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]], warn that some of these technologies could pose dangers, perhaps even contribute to the [[human extinction|extinction of humanity]] itself; i.e., some of them could involve [[existential risk]]s.&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| author = Bostrom, Nick| author-link = Nick Bostrom| title = Existential risks: analyzing human extinction scenarios| date = 2002 | url = http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html| accessdate=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Warwick|Warwick, K]]: “March of the Machines”, University of Illinois Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Much [[ethics of technology|ethical debate]] centers on issues of [[distributive justice]] in allocating access to beneficial forms of technology. Some thinkers, such as [[environmental ethics|environmental ethicist]] [[Bill McKibben]], oppose the continuing development of advanced technology partly out of fear that its benefits will be distributed unequally in ways that could worsen the [[economic inequality|plight of the poor]].&lt;ref name="McKibben 2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=McKibben, Bill|author-link=Bill McKibben|title=Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age|publisher=Times Books|date=2003|isbn=0-8050-7096-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[inventor]] [[Ray Kurzweil]] is among [[techno-utopianism|techno-utopians]] who believe that emerging and converging technologies could and will [[post scarcity|eliminate poverty]] and abolish suffering.&lt;ref name="Kurzweil 2005"&gt;{{cite book| author = Kurzweil, Raymond| author-link = Raymond Kurzweil| title = [[The Singularity Is Near|The Singularity Is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology]] | publisher = Viking Adult| date = 2005 | isbn = 0-670-03384-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some analysts such as Martin Ford, author of ''The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future'',&lt;ref name="Ford2009Lights"&gt;{{Ford 2009 The lights in the tunnel}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that as information technology advances, robots and other forms of automation will ultimately result in significant [[unemployment]] as machines and software begin to match and exceed the capability of workers to perform most routine jobs.

As robotics and artificial intelligence develop further, even many skilled jobs may be threatened. Technologies such as machine learning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://econfuture.wordpress.com/2011/04/14/machine-learning-a-job-killer/|title=Machine Learning: A job killer?|first=|last=econfuture|date=14 April 2011|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; may ultimately allow computers to do many knowledge-based jobs that require significant education. This may result in substantial unemployment at all skill levels, stagnant or falling wages for most workers, and increased concentration of income and wealth as the owners of capital capture an ever-larger fraction of the economy. This in turn could lead to depressed consumer spending and economic growth as the bulk of the population lacks sufficient discretionary income to purchase the products and services produced by the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://singularityhub.com/2009/12/15/martin-ford-asks-will-automation-lead-to-economic-collapse/|title=Martin Ford Asks: Will Automation Lead to Economic Collapse?|first=Aaron|last=Saenz|date=15 December 2009|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clear}}

''Artificial intelligence'' (''AI'') is the sub intelligence exhibited by machines or software, and the branch of [[computer science]] that develops machines and software with animal-like intelligence. Major AI researchers and textbooks define the field as "the study and design of intelligent agents", where an [[intelligent agent]] is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success. [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]], who coined the term in 1942, defines it as "the study of making intelligent machines".

The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, [[natural language processing]] (communication), [[perception]] and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (or "[[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]]") is still among the field's long-term goals. Currently popular approaches include deep learning, statistical methods, computational intelligence and traditional symbolic AI. There are an enormous number of tools used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, logic, methods based on probability and economics, and many others.

=== 3D Printing ===
{{Main|3D Printing}}
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, has been posited by [[Jeremy Rifkin]] and others as part of the [[Digital Revolution|third industrial revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thethirdindustrialrevolution.com/|title=Home – Office of Jeremy Rifkin|website=Office of Jeremy Rifkin|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Combined with Internet technology, 3D printing would allow for digital blueprints of virtually any material product to be sent instantly to another person to be produced on the spot, making purchasing a product online almost instantaneous.

Although this technology is still too crude to produce most products, it is rapidly developing and created a controversy in 2013 around the issue of 3D printed guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/3d-printed-guns-are-only-getting-better-and-scarier-1677747439|title=3D-Printed Guns Are Only Getting Better, and Scarier|first=Adam Clark|last=Estes|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene therapy ===

{{Main|Gene therapy}}
{{See also|Genetic engineering timeline}}

Gene therapy was first successfully demonstrated in late 1990/early 1991 for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency]], though the treatment was somatic – that is, did not affect the patient's germ line and thus was not heritable. This led the way to treatments for other genetic diseases and increased interest in [[germ line gene therapy]] – therapy affecting the gametes and descendants of patients.

Between September 1990 and January 2014 there were around 2,000 gene therapy trials conducted or approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/|title=Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Worldwide|website=www.wiley.com|accessdate=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer vaccines ===
{{Main|Cancer vaccine}}

A ''cancer vaccine'' is a [[vaccine]] that treats existing [[cancer]] or prevents the development of cancer in certain high-risk individuals. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as ''therapeutic'' cancer vaccines. There are currently no vaccines able to prevent cancer in general.

On April 14, 2009, [[Dendreon]] Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of [[Provenge]], a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)  approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/ucm210215.htm |date=2010-04-29 |title=Approval Letter – Provenge |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approval of Provenge has stimulated interest in this type of therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/what-comes-after-dendreon-s-provenge/77899342/ |title=What Comes After Dendreon’s Provenge? |date=18 Oct 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' meat ===
{{Main|In vitro meat}}

''In vitro meat'', also called ''cultured meat'', ''clean meat'', ''cruelty-free meat'', ''shmeat'', and ''test-tube meat'', is an animal-flesh product that has never been part of a living animal with exception of the [[fetal calf serum]] taken from a slaughtered cow.  In the 21st century, several research projects have worked on ''in vitro'' meat in the laboratory.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news |last = Siegelbaum |first = D.J. |title = In Search of a Test-Tube Hamburger |publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' |date = 2008-04-23 |url = http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1734630,00.html?imw=Y |accessdate = 2009-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cultured meat#First public trial|first in vitro beefburger]], created by a Dutch team, was eaten at a demonstration for the press in London in August 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC5Aug&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23576143|title=World's first lab-grown burger is eaten in London|date=5 August 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; There remain difficulties to be overcome before ''in vitro'' meat becomes commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/science/engineering-the-325000-in-vitro-burger.html|title=Engineering the $325,000 In Vitro Burger|first=Henry|last=Fountain|date=12 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=28 May 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultured meat is prohibitively expensive, but it is expected that the cost could be reduced to compete with that of conventionally obtained meat as technology improves.&lt;ref name="no-kill carnivore"&gt;{{cite news |last= Temple |first= James |title = The Future of Food: The No-kill Carnivore |publisher = [[Portfolio.com]] |date = 2009-02-23 |url = http://www.portfolio.com/views/columns/dual-perspectives/2009/02/23/The-No-kill-Carnivore|accessdate = 2009-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pharma Concepts"&gt;[http://www.new-harvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/culturedmeatecon.pdf Preliminary Economics Study of Cultured Meat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003000000/http://www.new-harvest.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/culturedmeatecon.pdf |date=October 3, 2015 }}, eXmoor Pharma Concepts, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''In vitro'' meat is also an ethical issue. Some argue that it is less objectionable than traditionally obtained meat because it doesn't involve killing and reduces the risk of animal cruelty, while others disagree with eating meat that has not developed naturally.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

=== Nanotechnology ===
{{Main|Nanotechnology|Outline of nanotechnology}}

''Nanotechnology'' (sometimes shortened to ''nanotech'') is the manipulation of matter on an [[atom]]ic, [[molecular]], and [[Supramolecular chemistry|supramolecular]] scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology&lt;ref name=Engines1&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology|date=1986|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=0-385-19973-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nanotsystems&gt;{{cite book|last=Drexler|first=K. Eric|title=Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation|date=1992|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-57547-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as [[molecular nanotechnology]]. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the [[National Nanotechnology Initiative]], which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 [[nanometers]]. This definition reflects the fact that [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effects are important at this [[quantum realm|quantum-realm]] scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter that occur below the given size threshold.

=== Robotics ===
{{Main|Robotics|Outline of robotics}}

''Robotics'' is the branch of [[technology]] that deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of [[robot]]s,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|title=robotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/view/entry/m_en_gb0714530#m_en_gb0714530|publisher=Oxford Dictionaries|accessdate=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback, and information processing. These technologies deal with automated machines that can take the place of humans in dangerous environments or manufacturing processes, or resemble humans in appearance, behavior, and/or cognition. A good example of robots which resembles humans is [[Sophia (robot)|Sophia]], a social [[humanoid robot]] developed by [[Hong Kong]]-based company [[Hanson Robotics Limited|Hanson Robotics]] which was activated on April 19, 2015. Many of today's robots are inspired by nature contributing to the field of [[bio-inspired robotics]].

=== Stem cell therapy ===
{{Main|Stem cell therapy}}

''Stem cell therapy'' is an intervention strategy that introduces new adult stem cells into damaged tissue in order to treat disease or injury. Many [[medical research]]ers believe that stem cell treatments have the potential to change the face of human disease and alleviate suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindvall |first1=O. |last2=Kokaia |first2=Z. |date=2006 |title=Stem cells for the treatment of neurological disorders |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue= 7097| doi = 10.1038/nature04960 | pmid=16810245 |pages=1094–1096 |bibcode=2006Natur.441.1094L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of [[stem cell]]s to self-renew and give rise to subsequent generations with variable degrees of differentiation capacities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81692-X |author=Weissman IL |title=Stem cells: units of development, units of regeneration, and units in evolution |journal=Cell |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=157–68 |date=January 2000 |pmid=10647940 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0092-8674(00)81692-X}} as cited in {{cite journal |author=Gurtner GC|author2=Callaghan MJ|author3=Longaker MT |title=Progress and potential for regenerative medicine |journal=Annu.

=== Distributed ledger technology===
{{Main|Blockchain|Smart contracts}}''Distributed ledger'' or ''blockchain technology'' is a technology which provides transparent and immutable lists of transactions. Blockchains can enable autonomous transactions through the use of [[smart contract]]s. Smart contracts are self-executing transactions which occur when pre-defined conditions are met. The original idea of a smart contract was conceived by [[Nick Szabo]] in 1994&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/smart_contracts_2.html|title=Nick Szabo -- Smart Contracts: Building Blocks for Digital Markets|website=www.fon.hum.uva.nl|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these original theories about how these smart contracts could work remained unrealised because there was no technology to support programmable agreements and transactions between parties. His example of a smart contract was the vending machine that holds goods until money has been received and then the goods are released to the buyer. The machine holds the property and is able to enforce the contract. There were two main issues that needed to be addressed before smart contracts could be used in the real world. Firstly, the control of physical assets by smart contracts to be able to enforce agreements. Secondly, the last of trustworthy computers that are reliable and trusted to execute the contract between two or more parties. It is only with the advent of [[cryptocurrency]] and [[encryption]] that the technology for smart contracts has come to fruition. Many potential applications of smart contracts have been suggested that go beyond the transfer of value from one party to another, such as supply chain management, electronic voting, law and the internet of things.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2017/581948/EPRS_IDA(2017)581948_EN.pdf How blockchain technology could change our lives] - European Parliamentary Research Service&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Business Innovation Through Blockchain: The B3 Perspective|last=Vincenzo|first=Morabito|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=101–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of emerging technologies ==
As innovation drives economic growth, and large economic rewards come from new inventions, a great deal of resources (funding and effort) go into the development of emerging technologies.  Some of the sources of these resources are described below...

=== Research and development ===
[[Research and development]] is directed towards the advancement of technology in general, and therefore includes development of emerging technologies.  ''See also [[List of countries by research and development spending]].''

[[Applied research]] is a form of systematic inquiry involving the practical application of science. It accesses and uses some part of the research communities' (the academia's) accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, often state-, business-, or client-driven purpose.

[[Science policy]] is the area of public policy which is concerned with the policies that affect the conduct of the science and research enterprise, including the funding of science, often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development, health care and environmental monitoring.

=== DARPA ===
The [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)]] is an agency of the U.S. Department of Defense responsible for the development of emerging technologies for use by the military.

DARPA was created in 1958 as the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Its purpose was to formulate and execute research and development projects to expand the frontiers of technology and science, with the aim to reach beyond immediate military requirements.

Projects funded by DARPA have provided significant technologies that influenced many non-military fields, such as the [[ARPANET|Internet]] and Global Positioning System technology.

=== Technology competitions and awards ===
There are awards that provide incentive to push the limits of technology (generally synonymous with emerging technologies).  Note that while some of these awards reward achievement after-the-fact via analysis of the merits of technological breakthroughs, others provide incentive via competitions for awards offered for goals yet to be achieved.

The [[Orteig Prize]] was a $25,000 award offered in 1919 by French hotelier [[Raymond Orteig]] for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris.  In 1927, underdog [[Charles Lindbergh]] won the prize in a modified single-engine Ryan aircraft called the [[Spirit of St. Louis]].  In total, nine teams spent $400,000 in pursuit of the Orteig Prize.

The XPRIZE series of awards, public competitions designed and managed by the non-profit organization called the [[X Prize Foundation]], are intended to encourage technological development that could benefit mankind. The most high-profile XPRIZE to date was the $10,000,000 Ansari XPRIZE relating to spacecraft development, which was awarded in 2004 for the development of [[SpaceShipOne]].

The [[Turing Award]] is an annual prize given by the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) to "an individual selected for contributions of a technical nature made to the computing community". It is stipulated that "The contributions should be of lasting and major technical importance to the computer field". The Turing Award is generally recognized as the highest distinction in computer science, and in 2014 grew to $1,000,000.

The [[Millennium Technology Prize]] is awarded once every two years by [[Technology Academy Finland]], an independent fund established by Finnish industry and the Finnish state in partnership.  The first recipient was [[Tim Berners-Lee]], inventor of the [[World Wide Web]].

In 2003, [[David Gobel]] seed-funded the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]] (Mprize) to encourage the development of new life extension therapies in mice, which are genetically similar to humans. So far, three Mouse Prizes have been awarded: one for breaking longevity records to Dr. Andrzej Bartke of [[Southern Illinois University]]; one for late-onset rejuvenation strategies to Dr. Stephen Spindler of the [[University of California]]; and one to Dr. Z. Dave Sharp for his work with the pharmaceutical rapamycin.

== Role of science fiction ==

[[Science fiction]] has criticized developing and future technologies, but also inspires [[innovation]] and new technology. This topic has been more often discussed in literary and sociological than in scientific forums. Cinema and media theorist [[Vivian Sobchack]] examines the dialogue between science fiction films and technological imagination. Technology impacts artists and how they portray their fictionalized subjects, but the fictional world gives back to science by broadening imagination. ''[[How William Shatner Changed the World]]'' is a documentary that gave a number of real-world examples of actualized technological imaginations. While more prevalent in the early years of science fiction with writers like [[Arthur C. Clarke]], new authors still find ways to make currently impossible technologies seem closer to being realized.

'''Emilio Covelli''' (1846–1915) was an Italian anarchist and socialist who together with [[Carlo Cafiero]] was one of the most important figures in the early socialist movement in Italy, a member of the [[International Workingmen's Association]], or "First International". He lived in exile in Paris for a while, returning to Italy for reasons of health, and dying in the psychiatric hospital in Nocera Inferiore.

==Early life==
Covelli was born into an aristocratic family in Trani ([[Apulia]]). He received his secondary education at a seminary in Molfetta (where he was in the same class as Cafiero), but after studying law at Naples University and then in Heidelberg and Berlin (where he studied under [[Eugen Dühring]]), he moved towards socialism, leaving his bourgeois origins behind him.

==Activism==
His extensive knowledge of German socialist literature (Dühring, Marx, etc.) was fundamental in introducing the ideas of "scientific socialism" into his own country, particularly through his 1874 work ''L’economia politica e la scienza'', one of the earliest pieces of socialist theoretical writings in Italian.&lt;ref&gt;Masini, Pier Carlo, "Emilio COVELLI", in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 30, Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana. Alberto M. Ghisalberti (ed.), Rome 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1908, he published ''Economia e Socialismo''.

He joined the Naples branch of the International in 1875,&lt;ref&gt;Masini, Pier Carlo, "Emilio COVELLI", in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 30, Istituto della Enciclopedia Italiana. Alberto M. Ghisalberti (ed.), Rome 1984&lt;/ref&gt; becoming an important influence within it and also contributing to the newspaper, "La Campana". Together with [[Carlo Cafiero]], [[Errico Malatesta]] and [[Andrea Costa]], he was instrumental in moving the Italian anarchist movement away from the collectivism it professed in the days of [[Mikhail Bakunin]] in order to adopt the communist formula "''From each according to ability, to each according to need''".&lt;ref&gt;Damiani, Franco, ''Carlo Cafiero nella storia del primo socialismo italiano'', Jaca Book, Milano 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1876 congress of the Italian Federation of the International in Florence-Tosi, it was these four who were responsible for the adoption of the anarchist communist programme.

In 1877, together with Malatesta, Cafiero and others, he participated in the unsuccessful Benevento uprising, following which he moved to Genoa, where he founded branches of the International. After a spell in prison he left the country, moving to London first, where he launched and edited a magazine, "Redattori della Lotta!", and then Geneva, where he founded the "I Malfattori" magazine, before returning once more to Italy.

Together with most of the anarchist movement{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, he was to turn to more radical methods of ''propaganda by the deed'' in the 1880s and was forced to live on the run for several years, suffering a mental breakdown in 1884. After his release from the Como psychiatric hospital, he moved abroad, living at various times in Switzerland, Greece and Turkey. The last 23 years of his life were spent in a series of mental institutions and he eventually died in the same hospital as Cafiero, in Nocera Inferiore.

The commemorative plaque on Palazzo Covelli, the family home, in Trani bears his words: "''I shall not sell myself either to any government or to any party... I have craved misery, persecution and slander. I have lost everything, there remains only what is me''".

}}'''Enenche Akogwu''', (30 March 1980 – 20 January 2012), a [[Nigeria]]n journalist and cameraman for [[Channels TV|Channels Television]]  in [[Kano]], was investigating [[Boko Haram]] terrorism when he was shot and killed by an unidentified gunman. His work mainly focused on human rights, politics, and war.

== Personal ==
[[File:Benue-State-University_makurdi.jpg|thumb|left|Benue State University]]Enenche Akogwu was the son of Agnes Akogwu, his widowed mother. She said after his father Jonah's death in 2010, Enenche assumed the responsibility for taking care of the family.

== Career ==
At the time of his death, Enenche Akogwu was a reporter and camera operator for Channels Television, a privately owned station based in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref name=ipi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freemedia.at/newssview/article/nigeria-journalist-killed-in-kano-terror-attack.html |title=International Press Institute: Nigeria Journalist Killed in Kano Terror Attack |author=International Press Institute |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918210204/http://www.freemedia.at/newssview/article/nigeria-journalist-killed-in-kano-terror-attack.html |archivedate=2015-09-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His work mainly focused on human rights, politics, and war. He began working for Channels TV in 2010, as a correspondent in [[Abuja]], the capital of Nigeria.

}}&lt;!--end wikitable--&gt;On 20 January 2012, Enenche Akogwu was killed at the age of 31. Earlier that day, he was at his office in Kano with his best friend and colleague, Idris Jibrin, when they heard several bomb explosions and decided to investigate.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="africanspotlight" /&gt; Akogwu heard that some of the bombing was taking place at the Farm Centre Police Station so he went there and approached some by-standers to get a quote. Those by-standers turned out to be [[Islamic|Islam]] Militants from the terrorist group Boko Haram, who immediately shot and killed Akogwu.&lt;ref name="africanspotlight" /&gt;&lt;ref name=channelstv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelstv.com/2012/01/21/channels-television-reporter-enenche-akogwu-killed-in-kano-blasts/|title=Channels Television Reporter Enenche Akogwu Killed in Kano Blasts – Channels Television|work=Channels Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jibrin heard about the gunfire at Farm Centre, he tried calling Akogwu's cellphone but got no answer. He headed toward the scene to see if Akogwu was alright. A by-stander told Jibrin that a journalist had been shot, so he went to the body and discovered that it was Akogwu. Akogwu had been shot six times. He was shot three times in the chest and three times in the stomach. Jibrin delivered the news to Channels Television that their journalist had been killed.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;

== Context ==

Akogwu had previously spent some time in Lagos, Nigeria and returned to Kano only two days before he was shot by Boko Haram.&lt;ref name=lindaikejisblog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindaikejisblog.com/2012/01/channels-tv-reporter-enenche-akogwu.html|title=Welcome to Linda Ikeji's Blog|author=Linda Ikeji|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bashir Adigun, Channels TV regional news editor, Akogwu had been gone for a news conference that was put on by police to discuss recent suicide bombings on government buildings.&lt;ref name=africanoutlookonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanoutlookonline.com/index.php/component/content/article?id=3711:nigerian-tv-journalist-killed-in-kano-attacks-|title=African Outlook Online – African Outlook Online|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bombings that Akogwu discussed at the conference were claimed to be the work of Boko Haram, the very same group that is now responsible for his death.&lt;ref name=ifex&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ifex.org/nigeria/2012/01/25/akogwu_killed/|title=Journalist killed while covering terrorist bombings – IFEX|work=IFEX}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timeline of Boko Haram insurgency|Boko Haram insurgency]] began in July 2009 with the [[2009 Boko Haram uprising]]. Almost 1,000 people were killed in this fight between Boko Haram and Nigerian soldiers.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-13809501|title=Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram Islamists?|date=4 May 2015|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/28/world/africa/28nigeria.html?_r=2|title=Scores Die as Fighters Battle Nigerian Police|date=27 July 2009|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout 2010 and 2011, Boko Haram was responsible for several more attacks and bombings, which killed hundreds of people. Then, the group attacked Kano on 20 January 2012, killing over 170 people, including Enenche Akogwu. As of that day, this was its single most deadly attack.&lt;ref name="ipi" /&gt; According to [[Reporters Without Borders]], Akogwu was the second journalist to ever be killed by Boko Haram, the first of whom was Zakariya Isa, shot and killed in [[Maiduguri, Nigeria]].&lt;ref name=rsfarticle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rsf.org/nigeria-tv-reporter-gunned-down-while-23-01-2012,41741.html|title=TV reporter gunned down while covering Kano suicide bombings – Reporters Without Borders|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated number of deaths from the Kano attacks was discovered by reporters from the [[Associated Press]] who actually counted the bodies in the mortuary at the Murtala Muhammed Specialist Hospital.&lt;ref name=premiumtimesng&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/3530-120-feared-dead-in-kano-boko-haram-attacks.html|title=120 feared dead in Kano Boko Haram attacks – Premium Times Nigeria|work=Premium Times Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondents from the private Leadership newspaper also found victims from the bombings in the mortuaries at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital and the Sir Muhammadu Sanusi Hospital. After these findings, the estimated total number of deaths from the Kano attacks was raised to 215.&lt;ref name=liveofofo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liveofofo.com/general-news/13-igbos-murdered-in-mubi-were-killed-by-their-kinsmen-not-boko-haram-governor-murtala-nyak.html/|title=13 Igbos Murdered In Mubi Were Killed By Their Kinsmen, Not Boko Haram – Governor Murtala Nyak|work=Liveofofo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attack of the day was directed toward the [[Nigeria Police]] Headquarters on [[Bayero University Kano|Bayero University]] (BUK) Road. By-standers say that a suicide bomber drove a Honda Civic into the police headquarters, killing himself and three police officers.&lt;ref name="premiumtimesng" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gistmania&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gistmania.com/talk/topic,89482.0.html|title=Boko Haram bombs Kano, kill Channels TV Enenche Akogwu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attack was soon followed by attacks on the Zaria Road Police Station and the Farm Centre Police Station, where Akogwu was killed. It was later discovered that the immigration office in Kano was also attacked, resulting in the death of more officers.&lt;ref name="premiumtimesng" /&gt; Reportedly, twenty bombs went off in Kano on 20 January 2012.&lt;ref name=dailytrust&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytrust.com.ng/sunday/index.php/sunday-column/7372-enenche-akogwu-dies-in-kano-attacks|title=Enenche Akogwu dies in Kano attacks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, authorities were unsure who caused the attacks, but Boko Haram took responsibility for them, saying that its motive was to get revenge for the recent arrests of its members.&lt;ref name="premiumtimesng" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ipi" /&gt;

According to [[Vanguard (Nigeria)|Vanguard]] News, Akogwu had previously spoken out against Boko Haram on his personal Facebook page. His rebuttal was in response to the group deciding that all northerners and Christians who lived in the northern states of Nigeria should move to different places. This applied to Akogwu because he was a Christian from Kano, which is a northern state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2012/01/enenche-the-grief-for-a-young-patriot/|title=Enenche: The grief for a young patriot|date=25 January 2012|work=Vanguard News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==

After Akogwu's death, his mother, Agnes Akogwu and best friend and colleague at Channels Television, Idris Jibrin, both told reporters that he was a dedicated journalist who loved his job.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt;&lt;ref name="idomavoice" /&gt; In an interview with Idoma Voice reporters, Agnes said that even her husband, who died two years before Akogwu, said their son would make a successful reporter.&lt;ref name=idomanews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idomanews.com/boko-haram-remembering-enenche-akogwu-four-years-after/|title=Boko Haram: Remembering Enenche Akogwu Four years after|author=Michael Onjewu|date=20 January 2016|work=IDOMANEWS.COM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proving them all right, Akogwu was awarded with Channels Television's 2011 chairman's award.&lt;ref name="africanspotlight" /&gt;

== Reactions ==

[[Irina Bokova]], the Director-General of [[UNESCO]], responded to Akogwu's death and the Boko Haram attacks by saying that the "crime constitutes a serious attack on the basic human right of [[freedom of expression]] and [[press freedom]]." She also called on "the Nigerian authorities to investigate these killings." &lt;ref name=unesco&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/director_general_condemns_murder_of_nigerian_journalists_nansok_sallah_and_enenche_akogwu/#.UjjLxtLRh8E|title=Director-General condemns murder of Nigerian journalists Nansok Sallah and Enenche Akogwu – United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The morning after the attacks, [[Red Cross]] officials evacuated the city of Kano and carried injured victims to safety. All hospitals in Kano were under orders from the state government to treat victims with the best care possible and to provide them with free treatment.&lt;ref name=xinhuanet&gt;{{Cite news| title = 150 killed in attacks in Northern Nigeria state: official | first = Tang| last = Danlu| url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2012-01/22/c_122615560.htm| publisher = Xinhua| date = January 22, 2012| accessdate = February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coworker of Akogwu, Chika Moses, told reporters that the whole crew at Channels TV was devastated when they heard about Akogwu's death, especially when they had to deliver the news about the death of their own journalist.&lt;ref name="africanspotlight" /&gt; Just days after Nigeria learned about Akogwu's death, a picture of him wearing a vest with the word "PRESS" written in bold letters across the front spread rapidly on various blogs and social media.&lt;ref name=dailypost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.com.ng/2013/01/27/ameh-comrade-godwin-one-year-after-enenche-akogwu-forgotten-so-soon/|title=Ameh Comrade Godwin: One year after: Enenche Akogwu, forgotten so soon?|work=DailyPost Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four years after Akogwu's death, his mother, Agnes Akogwu was approached by reporters from Idoma Voice.&lt;ref name="idomavoice" /&gt; She told them she was still in disbelief.  When Akogwu's father died in 2010, his mother talked to him about his career because she worried it was unsafe. Agnes said that the former senate president of Nigeria, [[David Mark]], was very supportive after the death of her son.&lt;ref name="idomanews" /&gt; She also said that Channels TV and Idoma leaders were very helpful at that time and that the [[Benue State|Benue]] and Kano state governments were generous enough to give her financial support. However, she did mention that there were some people who approached her at her son's burial and promised to help her other children get through school, but she had still not heard from them four years later.&lt;ref name="idomavoice" /&gt;

After Akogwu's death, his best friend and colleague, Idris Jibrin, admitted that Nigerian Police do not perform their jobs well. He claims that they tell journalists that when they go out on the job, they go at their own risk because the police cannot protect them. Jibrin also says that even the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) does not help and protect journalists like they should. The union was asked, by email, to comment on the tragedy but never responded.&lt;ref name="independent" /&gt; Another source claims that NUJ did comment on the events of Akogwu's death by saying that "journalism in the country is hovering in a dangerous environment."&lt;ref name=dc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digicastmagazine.com/issue/january-2012/article/kano-blasts-pres-jonathan-govs-commiserate-with-channels-tv#.UjjNItLRh8E|title=Kano blasts: Pres. Jonathan, Govs. Commiserate with Channels TV –   www.digicastmagazine.com – Magazine that makes broadcast sense|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist, Paul Dada, also spoke out saying that the employers of reporters need to do a better job at ensuring the safety of their employees.&lt;ref name="allafrica-case"&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/201201301810.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after Boko Haram attacked, [[Goodluck Jonathan]], president of Nigeria at the time of Akogwu's death, promised that those responsible for the attacks would be brought to justice.&lt;ref name=adebayoalonge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adebayoalonge.com/2012/01/21/text-of-president-goodluck-jonathans-condolence-message-to-victims-of-kano-bomb-blast/#more-369|title=Text Of President Goodluck Jonathan's Condolence Message To Victims of Kano Bomb Blast|work=adebayoalonge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mohamed Keita]], the Africa Advocacy coordinator for the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], also urged that action be taken to bring the attackers to justice.&lt;ref name=newssafety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newssafety.org/news/newsletter-signup/detail/nigerian-reporter-murdered-while-covering-bombings-340/|title=Nigerian reporter murdered while covering bombings|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nigerian National Committee from the [[International Press Institute]] (IPI) recommended that the Nigerian government take action to better protect journalists in the future. In addition, IPI said that journalists should also be careful while on the job and should prioritize their own safety above their work.&lt;ref name="ipi" /&gt; Reporters were unable to contact the Kano state police commissioner for comments on the evidence but instead, got a response from an official from the [[National Emergency Management Agency]] (NEMA). [[Yushau Shuaib]] from NEMA said that they were trying to save as many of the injured as they could and some NEMA officials from [[Kaduna]] even moved to Kano to help.&lt;ref name="premiumtimesng" /&gt;

The GAPP framework was previously known as the AICPA/CICA Privacy Framework, and is founded on a single privacy principle: [[personally identifiable information]] must be collected, used, retained and disclosed in compliance with the commitments in the entity's privacy notice and with criteria set out in the GAPP issued by the AICPA/CICA. This privacy objective is supported by ten main principles and over seventy objectives, with associated measurable criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Guillaume Édouard Marie Dubufe''' (16 May 1853, [[Paris]] &amp;ndash; 25 May 1909, at sea, near [[Buenos Aires]]) was a French painter, decorator and illustrator.

== Biography ==
His father [[Édouard Louis Dubufe|Édouard]] was a painter and his mother {{ill|Juliette Dubufe|fr}} (the daughter of composer [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann]]) was a sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gw4.geneanet.org/index.php3?b=pdelaubier&amp;lang=fr&amp;m=N&amp;v=Dubufe&amp;cgl=o Genealogy of the artist] @ GeneaNet&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, [[Claude Marie Paul Dubufe|Claude]], was also a painter and [[Charles Gounod]] was his uncle. Sadly, his mother died while giving birth to his sister Hortense when he was only two.

As might be expected, he received his first art lessons from his father, then pursued his studies at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] under [[Alexis-Joseph Mazerolle]]. His first major commission involved decorating the ceiling of the foyer at the [[Comédie-Française]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/catalogue-des-oeuvres/resultat-collection.html?no_cache=1&amp;zoom=1&amp;tx_damzoom_pi1%5Bzoom%5D=0&amp;tx_damzoom_pi1%5BxmlId%5D=009147&amp;tx_damzoom_pi1%5Bback%5D=fr%2Fcollections%2Fcatalogue-des-oeuvres%2Fresultat-collection.html%3Fno_cache%3D1%26zsz%3D9 Sketch for the ceiling of the Comédie Française] @ the [[Musée d'Orsay]]&lt;/ref&gt;

When not staying at their mansion in Paris, his family (he had five children) stayed at their villa in [[Anacapri]] on the [[Capri|Isle of Capri]], where he painted scenes of his home that would be exhibited in 1906 at the [[Georges Petit|Georges Petit Gallery]]. From 1888 to 1890, he produced a series of paintings featuring the [[Virgin Mary]]. During the 1890s, he decorated the ceilings of the Lobau Gallery at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], the banquet hall at the [[Élysée Palace]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RANEAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT530 Encyclopedia Americana (1903)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the library at the [[Sorbonne]]. In 1896, he designed and produced the décor for the "Salon National des Beaux-Arts". Four years later, he was one of several artists who provided decorations for [[Le Train Bleu (restaurant)|Le Train Bleu]], a famous restaurant near the [[Gare de Lyon]]. From 1906 to 1909, he and [[Édouard Rosset-Granger]] decorated the Town Hall of [[Saint-Mandé]]. He also illustrated several works by the French dramatist [[Émile Augier]].

He died at sea.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} His friend, the sculptor [[Albert Bartholomé]] provided the [[bas-relief]] for his memorial at [[Père Lachaise]] cemetery. In 1921, his mansion in Paris was acquired by Marie Henner, who turned it into a museum. It was donated to the French government in 1926, and is now known as the [[Musée national Jean-Jacques Henner]].

His daughter {{ill|Juliette Dubufe-Wehrlé|fr}}, also became a painter.

'''HMS ''Calypso''''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/102799.html?_ga=1.240226368.213952470.1479464899 An aquatinted etching of HMS Calypso (1783), the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, London]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Royal Navy]] Echo Class [[sloop-of-war|ship-sloop]]. She was built at [[Deptford Wharf|Deptford]] between 1781 and 1783, launched on 27 September 1783 and first commissioned on 1 December 1783 for service off Northern Ireland and Scotland. She served in the North Sea, Atlantic, and the West Indies. ''Calypso'' was sunk whilst acting as a convoy escort on 30 July 1803 after colliding with a [[West Indiaman]] merchant ship during a violent storm.

==Construction==

''Calypso'' was built to the same technical drawings as the five other ''Echo''-class ships: {{HMS|Echo|1782|2}}, {{HMS|Rattler|1783|2}}, {{HMS|Brisk|1784|2}}, {{HMS|Nautilus|1784|2}}, and {{HMS|Scorpion|1785|2}}. The class was designed to be 16-gun [[ship sloop]]s with [[quarterdeck]]s and [[forecastle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://collections.rmg.co.uk/collections/objects/83628.html?_ga=1.85545818.213952470.1479464899 Plan showing the inboard profile, upper deck, and lower deck]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Service history ==

''Calypso'' was first commissioned in September 1783 under Commander Ralph Dundas for service on the Irish and Scottish stations. She was then refitted at Plymouth and placed in [[Reserve fleet|ordinary]] in October 1785. She was paid off in October 1786.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

Her second commission began in January 1787 under Commander [[William Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)|William Mitchell]]. After fitting for Channel service she sailed for Jamaica on 16 April 1787,&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt; returning to home waters in 1790 and once more being placed in ordinary.

''Calypso'' underwent a period of repair and was refitted at [[HMNB Portsmouth|Portsmouth]] between July 1793 and March 1796. Her third commission began in January 1796 under Commander Andrew Smith, who took her to sea following her repair and refit to join [[Adam Duncan, 1st Viscount Duncan|Admiral Duncan's]] North Sea Fleet.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

In January 1797 Commander Richard Worsley took command and operated ''Calypso'' as a convoy escort and cruiser. Commander C. Collis succeeded Worsley in November 1797. Collis continued operating in this role until April 1798 when ''Calypso'' returned to Portsmouth for refit.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

Commander Henry Garrett took command in April 1799 and was succeeded by Commander Joseph Baker in November of that year. Baker took ''Calypso'' to the Caribbean, sailing for the [[Leeward Islands]] in February 1800. Whilst under Baker's command on this station, ''Calypso'' participated in several notable actions.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

*13 April 1800 - Her cutter took the schooner ''Diligente'' (6-guns)&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;{{refn|Head money for 57 men was paid in October 1829. A first-class share was worth [[£sd|£]]31 6[[shilling|s]] 4½[[pence|d]]; a fifth-class share, that of a seaman, was worth 4s ½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|date=11 September 1829|issue=18610|page=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}
*15 November 1800 - Fought off a French squadron, saving a convoy and capturing 16-gun sloop ''Ganso'' (with {{HMS|Crescent|1784|6}})&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

In October 1801 Commander [[Robert Barrie]] assumed command, followed by Commander [[Edward Pelham Brenton|Edward Brenton]] in April 1802, and finally by Commander William Venour in  August 1802.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

== Fate ==

On 30 July 1803, ''Calypso'' and the 74-gun [[HMS Goliath (1781)|''Goliath'']] were escorting a convoy of heavily laden West Indiamen from Jamaica. The convoy was caught in a violent storm that dismasted 21 of the vessels. One of the merchantmen ran down ''Calypso'', sinking her with the loss of all hands.&lt;ref&gt;Hepper (1994), p.102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commanding officers==

As an unrated sloop-of-war ''Calypso'' was too small a ship to warrant a [[Post Captain|Post-captain]] and was instead commanded by an officer in the rank of [[Commander (Royal Navy)|Commander]], although aboard ship he was afforded the courtesy title of Captain. The commanders of HMS ''Calypso'' were:&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;

*Cmdr Ralph Dundas (September 1783 - October 1785)
*Cmdr [[William Mitchell (Royal Navy officer)|William Mitchell]] (January 1787 - 1790)
*Cmdr Andrew Smith (January 1796 - January 1797)
*Cmdr Richard Worsley (January 1797 - November 1797)
*Cmdr William Collis (November 1797 - April 1798)
*Cmdr Henry Garrett (April 1799 - November 1799)
*Cmdr Joseph Baker (November 1799 - October 1801)
*Cmdr [[Robert Barrie]] (October 1801 - April 1802)
*Cmdr [[Edward Pelham Brenton|Edward Brenton]] (April 1802 - August 1802)
*Cmdr William Venour (August 1802 - July 1803)

== Crew ==

From 1794 the Admiralty allowed a crew of 121 for a 16-gun sloop such as HMS ''Calypso''. The Commander and Lieutenants were professional sea officers, trained in gunnery, navigation and seamanship in equal measure and appointed to the ship by Admiralty Commission. The Lieutenants were all at least nineteen years of age, having served a minimum six-year apprenticeship as Midshipman or Master's Mate before undertaking and passing the examination for Lieutenant. The Commander would usually have been an experienced Lieutenant who had come to the attention of the Admiralty or his Commander-in-Chief through some distinction in service or by having an influential patron. The Commander's duties were almost identical to those of a [[Post-captain|Post Captain]], although on a smaller scale, the exception being that as a Commander he had no automatic rights of promotion to the flag list and could quite easily remain a Commander for the rest of his career.

The Warrant Officers were specialists appointed to the ship by [[Navy Board]] Warrant. The Wardroom Warrant Officers were allowed all the privileges of a Commissioned Officer, eating and sleeping with the Lieutenants. The Standing Warrant Officers stayed with the ship throughout its commission and remained aboard when the ship was placed in ordinary. They were heavily involved with the fitting out of the ship and general maintenance. Cockpit Officers had a higher status than the Petty Officers and could generally expect to reach the Wardroom in time, with its members aspiring to be Lieutenants, Masters, Pursers or Surgeons. Petty Officers performed particular roles that required additional skills or expertise, and they were usually rated by the Captain or First Lieutenant on joining the ship. Unlike the Warrant Officers, the Petty Officers had no security in his rank; the Captain could demote a Petty Officer for negligence. A Petty Officer could also lose his rating on moving to a new ship.

The seaman were classed as either Able Seaman, Ordinary Seaman, or Landsman. An Able Seaman was an expert all rounder, happy aloft in the rigging or taking the helm and all other aspects of shipboard life. An Ordinary Seaman was one who had a grasp of basic seamanship and could be useful aboard ship but was not yet an expert or skillful sailor. A Landsman was a man with very little or no prior sea experience at all, most commonly a product of the press gang.

The full crewing requirements for a 16-gun sloop are given in the table below.&lt;ref&gt;Lavery (2009), p.328.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems''' or '''AAMAS''' is the leading scientific conference for research in the areas of artificial intelligence, autonomous agents, and multiagent systems. It is annually organized by a non-profit organization called the International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS).

== History ==
The AAMAS conference is a merger of three major international conferences/workshops, namely International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AGENTS), International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (ICMAS), and International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aamas-conference.org/ | title=International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (IFAAMAS) | accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, this highly respected joint conference provides a quality forum for discussing research in this area.

== Current and previous conferences ==
The next AAMAS conference (AAMAS 2018) will take place from July 10-15, 2018, in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;http://celweb.vuse.vanderbilt.edu/aamas18/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

Besides the main program that consists of a main track, an industry and applications track, and a couple of special area tracks, AAMAS also hosts over 20 workshops (e.g., AOSE, COIN, DALT, ProMAS, to mention a few) and many tutorials. There is also a demonstration session and a doctoral symposium. Finally, each year AAMAS features a bunch of awards, most notably the IFAAMAS Influential Paper Award. It publishes [[proceedings]] which are available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE146&amp;tab=pubs&amp;CFID=81044068&amp;CFTOKEN=86050602 |title=Event: AAMAS | publisher=[[ACM Digital Library#Digital Library|ACM Digital Library]] |accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ioannis Poutetsis''' ({{lang-el|Ιωάννης Πουτέτσης}}, 1878–1912) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] revolutionary leader from the region of [[Epirus]], in the early 20th century.

Poutetsis was born in the village of [[Stegopul]]i ([[Lunxhëri]]), near [[Gjirokastër]].&lt;ref name= Ruches&gt;{{cite book | last = Ruches | first = Pyrrhus J.| title = Albania's captives | publisher = Argonaut | year = 1965 | location = Chicago | page = 65 |ref= Ruches | isbn = | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=01eQAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=&amp;pgis=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From September 1908 he became the leader of one of the most notable Greek guerrilla groups that operated in the area of [[Ioannina]] before the outbreak of the imminent [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913), adopting the [[nom de guerre]] ''Vorgias''.&lt;ref name=Sakellariou&gt;M.

On September 26, 1912, his group was defeated near [[Delvinë]] in a battle against [[Albanians|Albanian]] groups and an Ottoman detachment, and Poutetsis was killed.&lt;ref name= Ruches/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sakellariou/&gt;

'''Jack Abrahams''', also known as Jack Abrams, was an English footballer who played as a wing-half. He played 13 matches and scored one goal in [[the Football League]] for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]].

Abrahams joined Burnley in September 1885 and played in many [[exhibition match|friendly matches]] during the 1885–86 season, scoring his first goal for the club in the 1–2 defeat to [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] on 19 September. He scored thrice in total over the course of the campaign, adding to his tally with goals against [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ray|last=Simpson|title=The Clarets Chronicles: The Definitive History of Burnley Football Club 1882–2007|publisher=Burnley Football Club|year=2007|isbn=978-0-9557468-0-2|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abrahams remained an integral part of the Burnley side during the following three seasons.
Jack Abrams made his League debut on 8 September 1888, playing at wing-half, at [[Deepdale]], home of [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]] who beat Burnley 5–2. Jack Abrams scored his debut and only League goal on 29 December 1888, playing at wing-half, at [[Turf Moor]], home of Burnley, Abrams scoring the only goal in a 1–0 win over [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. Jack Abrams appeared in 13 of the 22 League games played by Burnley in season 1888–89 scoring one League goal. As a wing-half (12 appearances) he played in a Burnley midfield that achieved a big (three–League–goals–or–more) win once. As a centre-half (one appearance) he played in a Burnley defence that kept the opposition to one–League–goal–in–a–match–once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= English National Football Archive| first=| last=| url=http://www.enfa.co.uk//| accessdate=2018-01-04}} (registration &amp; fee required)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Alfred Blair''' (6 January 1918 — 1983) was a Scottish professional [[Association football|football]] player. A [[Striker (association football)|forward]], he was the son of [[Scotland national football team|Scottish]] international [[Jimmy Blair (footballer, born 1888)|Jimmy Blair, Sr.]] and brother of [[Doug Blair (footballer)|Doug Blair]].

==Career==
Blair began his professional career with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref name=SFA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/football_player_profile.cfm?page=2492&amp;playerid=113208 |title=Jimmy Blair |publisher=Scottish Football Association |accessdate=24 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after failing to break into the ''Bluebirds'' first team, he was transferred to [[Joe Smith (football forward born 1889)|Joe Smith]]'s [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in June 1935. He made his debut for the ''Tangerines'' in the third league game of the [[Blackpool F.C. season 1937-38|1937–38]] season, in a single-goal victory over [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] at [[Bloomfield Road]] on 4 September 1937. His strike partner, [[Bobby Finan]], scored the goal. Blair went on to make a further twenty appearances in the league that campaign, scoring four goals in the process: two in a 4–2 victory at [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 16 September, one in a 4–2 defeat in the following game at home to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] two days later, and one in a 2–1 victory at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 23 October.

In [[Blackpool F.C. season 1938-39|1938–39]], Blair managed just four league appearances as Joe Smith tried out several partners for Bobby Finan. In the first full season after [[World War II]], [[Blackpool F.C. season 1946-47|1946–47]], Blair made twenty-five league appearances and scored four goals as Blackpool achieved a fifth-placed finish in [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. One of his goals gave Blackpool both points against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at Bloomfield Road on 2 November 1946, while another helped them to a 3–2 victory over [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], also at home, at the end of the month. Blair's final appearance for Blackpool occurred on 12 April 1947, in a 2–0 loss at home to [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]]. It was his fiftieth league appearance for the club.

Blair joined [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|Bournemouth &amp; Bomscombe Athletic]] in 1947, and in two years with the south-coast club he made eighty league appearances and scored eight goals.

In 1949, Blair joined [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]],&lt;ref name=SFA/&gt; with whom he made the most appearances and scored the most goals of his career: 104 league games and twenty-six goals. Blair's final two clubs were [[non-League]] outfits [[Ramsgate F.C.|Ramsgate Athletic]] and [[Canterbury City F.C.|Canterbury City]].

==International career==
Blair won one cap for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], on 19 October 1946, in a 3–1 defeat to [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Blair had played for the Wales schoolboys team.&lt;ref name=SFA/&gt;

==Death==
Blair died in 1983 at the age of 65.

[[File:Blick auf A 2 bei Raststätte Lehrter See (2009).jpg|right|thumb|Right-hand traffic on the [[Bundesautobahn 2|A2]] in [[Germany]]]]
[[File:Autoroute M25.jpg|right|thumb|Left-hand traffic on the [[M25 motorway]] in the [[UK]]]]

'''Left-hand traffic''' (LHT) and '''right-hand traffic''' (RHT) are the practice, in [[bidirectional traffic]], of keeping to the left side or to the right side of the road, respectively. A fundamental element to [[traffic]] flow, it is sometimes referred to as the '''rule of the road'''.&lt;ref name="kincaid"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kincaid |first=Peter |authorlink= |title=The Rule of the Road: An International Guide to History and Practice |publisher=Greenwood Press |date=December 1986 |location= |pages=50, 86–88, 99–100, 121–122, 198–202 |url= |doi= |id= |isbn=978-0-313-25249-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RHT is used in 163 countries and territories, with the remaining [[List of countries with left-hand traffic|78 countries and territories using LHT]]. Countries that use LHT account for about a sixth of the world's area with about 35% of humanity and a quarter of its roads.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barta|first1=Patrick |title=Shifting the Right of Way to the Left Leaves Some Samoans Feeling Wronged |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB125086852452149513 |work=The Wall Street Journal |access-date=4 December 2016}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, 104 of the world's territories were LHT and an equal number were RHT. From 1919 to 1986, 34 of the LHT territories switched to RHT.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Watson|first1=Ian|title=The rule of the road, 1919-1986: A case study of standards change|url=http://www.ianwatson.org/rule_of_the_road.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the countries with LHT were formerly part of the [[British Empire]]. In addition, [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Suriname]] and other countries have retained the LHT tradition. Conversely, many of the countries with RHT were formerly part of the [[French colonial empire]] or, in Europe, were subject to French rule during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic conquests]].

For [[Rail transport|rail traffic]], LHT predominates in Western Europe (except [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Spain]] and the [[Netherlands]]), Latin America, and in countries formerly in the British and French Empires, whereas North American and central and eastern European train services operate RHT.

According to the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]] (the right-hand side), and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. For aircraft the US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/2EA99FD06D59A9BC852566CF00614DEA FAR Sec. 91.115](c): "When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to the right to keep well clear."&lt;/ref&gt;

In healthy populations, traffic safety is thought to be the same regardless of [[handedness]], although some researchers have speculated that LHT may be safer for ageing populations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foerch | first1 = C | last2 = Steinmetz | first2 = H | year = 2009 | title = Left-sided traffic directionality may be the safer "rule of the road" for ageing populations | url = | journal = Med Hypotheses | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 20–3 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.01.044 | pmid = 19327893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since humans are more commonly [[ocular dominance|right-eye dominant]] than left-eye dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Dominant Eye and Why it Matters|url=http://www.optilase.co.uk/your-dominant-eye-and-why-it-matters/|accessdate=11 December 2016|date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ancient Greek, Egyptian, and Roman troops kept to the left when marching.&lt;ref name="anderson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Charles|title=Puzzles and Essays from the Exchange Essays|date=2003|publisher=Haworth Information Press|pages=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, archaeologists found a well-preserved double track leading to a Roman quarry near [[Swindon]], in southern England. The grooves in the road on the left side (viewed facing down the track away from the quarry) were much deeper than those on the right side, suggesting LHT, at least at this location, since carts would exit the quarry heavily loaded, and enter it empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Bryn|title=Huge Roman Quarry found in North Wiltshire|journal=ARA the Bulletin of the Association for Roman Archaeology|volume=Autumn 1998|issue=Six|pages=8–9|url=http://www.associationromanarchaeology.org/ARA_Bulletin6.pdf|accessdate=7 October 2016|issn=1363-7967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reference in [[English law]] to an order for LHT was in 1756, with regard to [[London Bridge]].&lt;ref name="hamer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=Mike|title=Left is right on the road|journal=New Scientist|issue=20 December 1986/1 January 1987|pages=16–18|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qfak8nsMNGIC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=25 December 1986 – 1 January 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some historians, such as [[C. Northcote Parkinson]], believed that ancient travellers on horseback or on foot generally kept to the left, since most people were right-handed. If two men riding on horseback were to start a fight, each would edge toward the left.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt; In the year 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] directed pilgrims to keep left.&lt;ref name="anderson"/&gt;

In the late 1700s, traffic in the United States was RHT based on [[teamster]]s' use of large freight wagons pulled by several pairs of horses. The wagons had no driver's seat, so the (typically right-handed) [[postilion]] held his whip in his right hand and thus sat on the left rear horse. Seated on the left, the driver preferred that other wagons pass him on the left so that he could be sure to keep clear of the wheels of oncoming wagons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lyoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Why We Drive on the Right of the Road, ''Popular Science Monthly'', Vol.126, No.1, (January 1935), p.37 |accessdate=25 April 2012|publisher=Bonnier Corporation |date=January 1935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, traditionally foot traffic had kept right, while carriage traffic kept left. Following the [[French Revolution]], all traffic kept right.&lt;ref name="hamer"/&gt; Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French imposed RHT on parts of Europe.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim is found widely in popular literature but no reliable source has been seen|date=March 2018}} During the colonial period, RHT was introduced by the French in [[New France]], [[French West Africa]], the [[Maghreb]], [[French Indochina]], the [[West Indies]], [[French Guiana]] and the [[Réunion]], among others.

Meanwhile, LHT was introduced by the British in parts of Canada ([[Atlantic Canada]] and [[British Columbia]]), Australia, New Zealand, the [[East Africa Protectorate]] (now Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda), [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|British India]], [[Rhodesia]] and the [[Cape Colony]] (now Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa), [[British Malaya]] (now Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore), [[British Guiana]], and [[British Hong Kong]]. LHT was also introduced by the [[Portuguese Empire]] in [[Portuguese Macau]], [[Colonial Brazil]], [[Portuguese Timor]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]], and [[Portuguese Angola]].

The first keep-right law for [[driving in the United States]] was passed in 1792 and applied to the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]].&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"&gt;{{cite web|last=Weingroff|first=Richard|title=On The Right Side of the Road|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/right.cfm|publisher=United States Department of Transportation|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] formalized RHT in 1804, [[New Jersey]] in 1813 and [[Massachusetts]] in 1821.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/110303 |title=An Act Establishing the Law of the Road |publisher=Massachusetts General Court |accessdate=14 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s some countries including [[Canada]], [[Spain]], and [[Brazil]] had different rules in different parts of the country. During the 1900s many countries standardised within their jurisdictions, and changed from LHT to RHT, mostly to conform with regional custom. Currently nearly all countries use one side or the other throughout their entire territory. Most exceptions are due to historical considerations and/or involve islands with no road connection to the main part of a country. [[China]] is RHT except the [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China|Special Administrative Regions]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. The [[Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge]] is RHT even though both Hong Kong and Macau are LHT. The [[United States]] is RHT except the [[United States Virgin Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usvitourism.vi/travel_tips|title=Travel Tips &amp;#124; US Virgin Islands|publisher=Usvitourism.vi|accessdate=25 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom is LHT, but its [[British Overseas Territory|overseas territories]] of [[Gibraltar]] and [[British Indian Ocean Territory]] are RHT.

==Changing sides==
[[File:Kungsgatan 1967.jpg|thumb|Traffic moves from left to right in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], on 3 September 1967]]

===Europe===

Influential in Europe was the 1920 Paris Convention, which advised driving on the right-hand side of the road, in order to harmonise traffic across a continent with many borders. This was despite the fact that left-hand traffic was still widespread: in 1915 for example, LHT was introduced everywhere in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]; however, three years later the Empire was split up into several countries, and they all changed eventually to RHT, notably including when Nazi Germany [[switch to right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia|introduced RHT with almost immediate effect in Czechoslovakia]] in 1938–39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vasold|first1=Manfred|title=Obacht!

[[Sweden]] was LHT from about 1734 to 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vardo.aland.fi/hogertrafik.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203201537/http://www.vardo.aland.fi/hogertrafik.htm|archivedate=3 December 2007|title=Högertrafik |language=Swedish|accessdate=11 August 2006|publisher=vardo.aland.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite having land borders with RHT countries, and approximately 90 percent of cars being left-hand drive (LHD) vehicles.&lt;ref name="Réalités"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TdYnAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22iceland%22+drive+on+right+%221968%22+%22left+hand+drive%22&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22left+hand+drive%22 ''Réalités''], Issues 200-205, Société d'études et publications économiques, 1967, page 95&lt;/ref&gt; A referendum was held in 1955, with an overwhelming majority voting against a change to RHT. Nevertheless, some years later the government ordered a conversion, which took place at 5 am on Sunday, 3 September 1967. The accident rate dropped sharply after the change,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=TIME |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C941144%2C00.html? |title=Sweden: Switch to the Right |publisher=TIME |date=15 September 1967 |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018034155/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,941144,00.html |archivedate=18 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but soon rose back to near its original level.&lt;ref name="salon20090814"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mieszkowski |first=Katharine |url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/08/14/driving_on_left/ |title=Salon News: Whose side of the road are you on? |publisher=Salon.com |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day was known as ''[[Dagen H]]'' ("H-Day"), the 'H' being for ''Högertrafik'' ("right traffic"). When Iceland switched the following year, it was known as ''[[H-dagurinn]]'', again meaning "H-Day".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2013/05/26/45_ar_fra_haegri_umferd/ 45 ár frá hægri umferð], ''[[Morgunbladid|Morgunblaðið]]'', 26 May 2013 [https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?sl=is&amp;tl=en&amp;js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mbl.is%2Ffrettir%2Finnlent%2F2013%2F05%2F26%2F45_ar_fra_haegri_umferd%2F&amp;edit-text= English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, the UK [[Department for Transport]] considered switching to RHT, but declared it unsafe and too costly for such a built-up nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8239048.stm |title=Could the UK drive on the right?  |author=Tom Geoghegan  |date=7 September 2009 |work=BBC News Magazine |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Road building standards, for motorways in particular, allow asymmetrically designed road junctions, where merge and diverge lanes differ in length.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, four countries in Europe continue to use left-hand traffic, all island nations: the UK, [[Cyprus]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and [[Malta]].

===Asia and the Pacific===

[[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Nationalist China]] adopted RHT in 1946. This convention was preserved when the [[Communist Party of China|CCP]] took the mainland and the [[Kuomintang|KMT]] retreated to Taiwan. Hong Kong and Macau continue to be LHT.

Both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] switched to RHT in 1945 after liberation from Japanese colonial power.

[[Myanmar]] switched to RHT in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Unique World of Burmese Driving | website=a minor diversion | date=2012-03-14 | url=http://www.minordiversion.com/2012/03/the-unique-world-of-burmese-driving/ | accessdate=2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samoa]], a former German colony, had been RHT for more than a century. It switched to LHT in 2009,&lt;ref name="BBC Samoa"&gt;{{Cite news|  title =Samoan cars ready to switch sides|  publisher =BBC News | date = 7 September 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8240992.stm | accessdate = 7 September 2009 | first=Nick | last=Bryant}}&lt;/ref&gt; being the first territory in almost 30 years to switch.&lt;ref name="reuters Samoa"/&gt; The move was legislated in 2008 to allow Samoans to use cheaper right-hand drive (RHD) vehicles—which are better suited for left-hand traffic—imported from Australia, New Zealand or Japan, and to harmonise with other South Pacific nations. A political party, [[The People's Party (Samoa)|The People's Party]], was formed to try to protest against the change, a protest group which launched a legal challenge,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10594375"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10594375 |title=Right-to-life plea fails to sway Samoan court in road appeal |author=Dyer, Gwynne |authorlink=Gwynne Dyer |date=1 September 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an estimated 18,000 people attending demonstrations against it.&lt;ref name="BBC Samoa2"&gt;{{Cite news|  title =Samoa drivers brace for left turn|  publisher =BBC News | date = 6 September 2009 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8236773.stm | accessdate = 7 September 2009 | first=Michael | last=Dobie}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motor industry was also opposed, as 14,000 of Samoa's 18,000 vehicles are designed for RHT and the government has refused to meet the cost of conversion.&lt;ref name="reuters Samoa"&gt;{{Cite news|  title =Outcry as Samoa motorists prepare to drive on left|  publisher =Reuters | date = 7 September 2009 | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5861QV20090907| accessdate = 7 September 2009| first=Pauline| last=Askin}}&lt;/ref&gt; After months of preparation, the switch from right to left happened in an atmosphere of national celebration. There were no reported incidents.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; At 05:50 local time, Monday 7 September, a radio announcement halted traffic, and an announcement at 6:00 ordered traffic to switch to LHT.&lt;ref name="BBC Samoa"/&gt; The change coincided with more restrictive enforcement of speeding and seat-belt laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/world/samoan-drivers-change-from-right-hand-side-of-the-road-to-the-left/story-e6frf7lf-1225770454009 |title=Samoan drivers change from right-hand side of the road to the left |publisher=Heraldsun.com.au |accessdate=31 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That day and the following day were declared public holidays, to reduce traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/2/story.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10523412 |title=Samoa announces driving switch date|publisher=Nzherald.co.nz |date= 25 July 2008|accessdate=10 June 2012 |first=Cherelle |last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change included a three-day ban on alcohol sales, while police mounted dozens of checkpoints, warning drivers to drive slowly.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;

The Philippines was mostly LHT during its [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/bibliotecabne/8219320037/ Plaza Mayor de Manila], by [[José Honorato Lozano]] (1815/21(?)-1885), in the album [https://www.flickr.com/photos/bibliotecabne/sets/72157632106172948/ ''Vistas de las islas Filipinas y trajes de sus habitantes''], published 1847.

===Africa===

A number of non-contiguous former British colonies in [[West Africa]] originally drove LHT and switched to RHT in the early 1970s to match the surrounding countries. [[Sierra Leone]] switched to RHT in 1971, [[Nigeria]] in 1972 and [[Ghana]] in 1974. Before this period [[The Gambia]], a country entirely contained within RHT Senegal, had officially switched to RHT in 1965.&lt;ref name="TBD Gambia" /&gt;

[[Rwanda]], a former Belgian colony in central Africa, is RHT but is considering switching to LHT, to bring the country in line with other members of the [[East African Community]] (EAC).&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.ug/index.php/news/regional-news/78-regional-news/1458-rwanda-wants-to-drive-on-the-left |title=Rwanda wants to drive on the left |publisher=Independent.co.ug |date=3 June 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey, carried out in 2009, indicated that 54% of Rwandans were in favour of the switch. Reasons cited were the perceived lower costs of RHD vehicles as opposed to LHD versions of the same model, easier maintenance and the political benefit of harmonisation of traffic regulations with other EAC countries. The same survey also indicated that RHD cars are 16 to 49 per cent cheaper than their LHD equivalents.&lt;ref name="business"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201009271438.html |title=East Africa: Rwanda Looks to the Left |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=27 September 2010 |accessdate=10 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 an internal report from consultants to the Ministry of Infrastructure recommended a switch to LHT.&lt;ref name=ETRR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bari|first1=Dr Mahabubul|title=The study of the possibility of switching driving side in Rwanda|journal=European Transport Research Review|volume=6|issue=4|pages=439–453|date=29 July 2014|doi=10.1007/s12544-014-0144-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the ban on RHD vehicles was lifted; RHD trucks from neighbouring countries cost $1000 less than LHD models imported from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/Rwanda/Business/Right-hand-drive-vehicles-return-on-Rwandan-roads-/1433224-2652722-1hwl76/index.html Right-hand-drive vehicles return on Rwandan roads], ''[[The East African]]'', March 13, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tumwebaze|first1=Peterson|title=Govt okays importation of RHD trucks, to decide on other vehicle categories in October|url=http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2014-09-09/538/business-govt-okays-importation-of-right-hand-drive-trucks,-to-decide-on-other-vehicle-categories-in-october|accessdate=29 October 2014|publisher=The New Times|date=9 September 2014|ref=newtimes2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
In one study, researchers concluded that left-hand traffic may be safer for elderly drivers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foerch | first1 = C | last2 = Steinmetz | first2 = H | year = 2009 | title = Left-sided traffic directionality may be the safer "rule of the road" for ageing populations | url = | journal = Med Hypotheses | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 20–3 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2009.01.044 | pmid = 19327893 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since humans are more commonly [[ocular dominance|right-eye dominant]] than left-eye dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Your Dominant Eye and Why it Matters| url=http://www.optilase.co.uk/your-dominant-eye-and-why-it-matters/| accessdate=2016-12-11| date=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comparing accident statistics between countries operating either LHT or RHT, Leeming concluded that LHT is superior.&lt;ref&gt;Leeming, J. J. 1969. Road accidents: prevent or punish? London: Cassell&lt;/ref&gt; However, Watson has criticised the small sample size and dismisses the notion.&lt;ref name="watson"/&gt;

==Changing sides at borders==
[[File:Drive-on-the-left-kent-1b.jpg|thumb|right|A road sign in the British county of [[Kent]] placed on the right-hand side of the road.]]
[[File:Danish motorcyclists about to cross the border between Sweden and Norway in 1934.png|thumb|right|Border between Sweden and Norway in 1934]]
Although many LHT jurisdictions are on islands, there are cases where vehicles may be driven from LHT across a border into a RHT area. Such borders are mostly located in Africa and southern Asia. The [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] regulates the use of foreign registered vehicles in the 74 countries that have ratified it.

LHT [[Thailand]] has three RHT neighbors: [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Myanmar]]. Most of its borders use a simple traffic light to do the switch, but there are also interchanges which enable the switch while keeping up a continuous flow of traffic.&lt;ref name="cnt"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennings|first1=Ken|title=What Happens When Left-Hand Roads Meet Right-Hand Roads|url=http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2013-04-15/lotus-bridge-macau-maphead-ken-jennings|website=Conde Nast Traveler|accessdate=18 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four road border crossing points between Hong Kong and Mainland China. In 2006, the daily average number of vehicle trips recorded at Lok Ma Chau was 31,100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yearbook.gov.hk/2006/en/13_08.htm |title=Hong Kong 2006 – Transport – Cross-Boundary Traffic |publisher=Yearbook.gov.hk |date=15 August 2007 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next largest is [[Man Kam To]], where there is no changeover system and the border roads on the mainland side [[Wenjindu]] intersect as one-way streets with a main road.

The [[Takutu River Bridge]] (which links LHT [[Guyana]] and RHT [[Brazil]]&lt;ref name="Takutu bridge opens to traffic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stabroeknews.com/2009/news/local/04/27/takutu-bridge-opens-to-traffic-2 |title=Takutu bridge opens to traffic |publisher=Stabroeknews.com |date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the only border in the Americas where traffic changes sides.

Although the United Kingdom is separated from [[Continental Europe]] by the [[English Channel]], the level of cross-Channel traffic is very high; the [[Channel Tunnel]] alone carries 3.5 million vehicles per year, by rail, between the UK and France.

==Road vehicle configurations==
===Driver seating position===
&lt;!-- **This page uses UK spelling variations. Please do not change this spelling to curb.** --&gt;
[[File:Bolivia Yunga Road.jpg|thumb|right|Bolivia is RHT, with the exception of [[Yungas Road]] which is LHT to help drivers see their outer wheel.]]
In RHT jurisdictions, vehicles are configured with LHD, with the driver sitting on the left side. In LHT jurisdictions, the reverse is true. The driver's side, the side closest to the centre of the road, is sometimes called the ''offside'', while the passenger side, the side closest to the side of the road, is sometimes called the ''nearside''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/nearside |title=Nearside (dictionary definition) |publisher=Dictionary.reverso.net |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This article uses UK English. --&gt;

Historically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic. Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD.&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"/&gt; In 1908 [[Henry Ford]] standardised the [[Model T]] as LHD in RHT America,&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"/&gt; arguing that with RHD and RHT, the passenger was obliged to "get out on the street side and walk around the car" and that with steering from the left, the driver "is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wayne|title=Car Crazy: The Battle for Supremacy between Ford and Olds and the Dawn of the Automobile Age|date=2015|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395526|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgIrCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=car+crazy+wayne+miller|accessdate=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford's lead, due to the popularity of the Model T.&lt;ref name="On The Right Side of the Road"/&gt;

In specialised cases, the driver will sit on the nearside, or kerbside. Examples include:
*Where the driver needs a good view of the nearside, e.g. [[street sweeper]]s, or vehicles driven along unstable road edges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lhdspecialist.com/location_of_the_steering_wheel.php LHD Specialist: Location of the Steering Wheel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921030931/http://www.lhdspecialist.com/location_of_the_steering_wheel.php |date=21 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where it is more convenient for the driver to be on the nearside, e.g. delivery vehicles. The [[Grumman LLV]] postal delivery truck is widely used with RHD configurations in RHT North America. Some [[Unimog]]s are designed to switch between LHD and RHD to permit operators to work on the more convenient side of the truck.

Generally, the convention is to mount a motorcycle on the left,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinchliffe|first1=Mark|title=How to mount your motorbike|url=https://motorbikewriter.com/mount-motorbike/|accessdate=11 December 2016|date=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[kickstand]]s are usually on the left&lt;ref name="tips"&gt;{{cite web|title=MOUNTING AND DISMOUNTING A MOTORCYCLE|url=http://www.motorcycletesttips.uk/motorcycle-riding-tutorials/mounting-and-dismounting-a-motorcycle/|website=Motorcycle Test Tips|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes it more convenient to mount on the safer kerbside&lt;ref name="tips"/&gt; as is the case in LHT. Some jurisdictions prohibit fitting a [[sidecar]] to a motorcycle's offside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/2003/si/5/made/en/print|title=S.I.

===Headlamps and other lighting equipment===
{{Main|Headlamp}}

[[File:Low beam light pattern for right-hand traffic.svg|thumb|left|Bird's-eye view of low beam light pattern for RH traffic, with long seeing range on the right and short cutoff on the left so oncoming drivers are not dazzled.]]

Most low-beam headlamps produce an asymmetrical light suitable for use on only one side of the road. Low beam headlamps in LHT jurisdictions throw most of their light forward-leftward; those for RHT throw most of their light forward-rightward, thus illuminating obstacles and road signs while minimising glare for oncoming traffic.

In Europe, headlamps approved for use on one side of the road must be adaptable to produce adequate illumination with controlled glare for temporarily driving on the other side of the road,&lt;ref name="R112"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/R112rev2_e.pdf |title=UN Regulation 112, "Motor vehicle headlamps emitting an asymmetrical passing beam or a driving beam or both and equipped with filament lamps" }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|p.13 ¶5.8}}. This may be achieved by affixing masking strips or prismatic lenses to a part of the lens or by moving all or part of the headlamp optic so all or part of the beam is shifted or the asymmetrical portion is occluded.&lt;ref name=R112/&gt;{{RP|p.13 ¶5.8.1}} Some varieties of the [[Headlamp#Projector (polyellipsoidal) lamps|projector-type headlamp]] can be fully adjusted to produce a proper LHT ''or'' RHT beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly.&lt;ref name=R112/&gt;{{RP|p.12 ¶5.4}} Some vehicles adjust the headlamps automatically when the car's [[GPS]] detects that the vehicle has moved from LHT to RHT and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Because blackout strips and adhesive prismatic lenses reduce the safety performance of the headlamps, most countries require all vehicles registered or used on a permanent or semi-permanent basis within the country to be equipped with headlamps designed for the correct traffic-handedness.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Without [[sidecar]]s attached, motorcycles, [[motor scooter]]s, [[moped]]s, and [[bicycle]]s are almost symmetric with their handlebars in the centre. However, motorcycles are often equipped with automotive-type asymmetrical-beam headlamps that likewise require adjustments or replacement when brought into a country with opposite traffic-handedness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

====Rear fog lamps====

In the European Union, vehicles must be equipped with one or two red [[Automotive Lighting#Rear fog lamps|rear fog lamps]]. A single rear fog lamp must be located between the vehicle's longitudinal centreline and the outer extent of the driver's side of the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/trans/main/wp29/wp29regs/2015/R048r12e.pdf|title=UN Regulation 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rear fog lamps are also being found on vehicles produced for Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.

===Crash testing differences===
An Australian news source reports that some RHD cars imported to that country did not perform as well on crash tests as the LHD versions, although the cause is unknown, and may be due to differences in testing methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Popular family SUV Hyundai Tucson slammed for 'four-star' Australian crash test result|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/motoring/popular-family-suv-hyundai-tucson-slammed-for-fourstar-australian-crash-test-result/news-story/466995147eb262b628fc71ca5e1cd89b|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide distribution by country==
Of the 194 countries currently recognised by the [[United Nations]] (and the unrecognised [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Kosovo|Kosovo]]), 140 use RHT and 54 use LHT. A country and its territories and dependencies is counted once.

A [[serial killer]] is typically a person who [[murder]]s three or more people, in two or more separate events over a period of time, for primarily psychological reasons.&lt;ref&gt;''Macmillan Encyclopedia of Death and Dying'' entry on [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5214/is_2003/ai_n19132282 "Serial Killers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105174409/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5214/is_2003/ai_n19132282 |date=2007-11-05 }} (2003) by Sandra Burkhalte Chmelir&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most common"&gt;A serial killer is most commonly defined as a person who kills three or more people for psychological gratification; reliable sources over the years agree. See, for example:
*{{cite web |title=Serial killer| publisher=''[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]''| accessdate=June 15, 2016|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/serial+killer|quote=A person who murders 3+ people over a period of &gt; 30 days, with an inactive period between each murder, and whose motivation for killing is largely based on psychological gratification.}}
*{{cite book| first1 = Ronald M. |last1=Holmes |first2=Stephen T. |last2=Holmes|title = Contemporary Perspectives on Serial Murder | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 1998 | page = 1 | accessdate = June 15, 2016 |isbn = 978-0-7619-1421-1| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0yfoJz6jHwkC&amp;pg=PA1|quote=Serial murder is the killing of three or more people over a period of more than 30 days, with a significant cooling-off period between the murders [...] The baseline number of three victims appears to be most common among those who are the academic authorities in the field. The time frame also appears to be an agreed-upon component of the definition.}}
*{{cite book| author = Wayne Petherick|title =Serial Crime: Theoretical and Practical Issues in Behavioral Profiling| publisher = [[Academic Press]] | year = 2005 | page = 190| accessdate = June 15, 2016 |isbn = 978-0-08-046854-9| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=U3-zunZ5eF4C&amp;pg=PA190|quote=Three killings seem to be required in the most popular operational definition of serial killing since they are enough to provide a pattern within the killings without being overly restrictive.}}

*{{cite book| author = Harold Schechter|title = The A to Z Encyclopedia of Serial Killers | publisher = [[Simon and Schuster]] | year = 2012 | page = 73| accessdate = June 15, 2016|isbn = 978-1-4391-3885-4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zM7ROzJPK2MC&amp;pg=PA73 |quote= Most experts seem to agree, however, that to qualify as a serial killer, an individual has to slay a minimum of three unrelated victims.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are gaps of time between the killings, which may range from a few days to months, or many years.&lt;ref name="Most common" /&gt; This list shows serial killers from the 20th century to present day by number of [[Victim of a crime|victims]]. In many cases, the exact number of victims assigned to a serial killer is not known, and even if that person is convicted of a few, there can be the possibility that they killed many more.

Organization and ranking of serial killings is made difficult by the complex nature of serial killers, and incomplete knowledge of the full extent of many killers' crimes. To address this, multiple categories have been provided in order to more accurately describe the nature of certain serial murders. This is not a reflection of an individual's overall rank, which may or may not vary depending on personal opinion concerning the nature and circumstances of their crimes. The fourth column in the table states the number of victims definitely assigned to that particular serial killer, and thus the table is in order of that figure. The fifth column states the number of possible victims the killer could have murdered. Some of these crimes are unsolved, but were included because they are the work of a serial killer, despite nobody being caught.

This list does not necessarily include [[war criminal]]s or members of [[democidal]] governments, such as [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Hideki Tojo]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]], or [[Pol Pot]].

== Serial killers with the highest known victim count ==
&lt;!-- BEFORE ADDING ANYONE MAKE SURE THAT THEY MEET THE ACTUAL CRITERIA FOR A SERIAL KILLER AND THAT THEY HAVE A WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE ALREADY; IF THEY DO NOT HAVE AN ARTICLE WE CAN ASSUME THEY ARE EITHER NOT NOTEWORTHY OR HAVE NOT BEEN DOCUMENTED WELL ENOUGH TO BE VERIFIABLE. ALL ENTRIES WITH RED LINKS OR NO LINKS WILL BE REMOVED--&gt;
The most prolific modern serial killer is [[Harold Shipman]], with 218 proven kills and possibly as many as 250 ([[#Medical professionals and pseudo-medical professionals|see "Medical professionals", below]]). Excluding these "Medical professionals and pseudo-medical professionals", with their ability to kill simply and in plain sight, and [[#Serial killer groups and couples|Serial killer groups and couples (below)]], this list is a compilation of modern serial killers currently with the highest verifiable murder count.

He was the first Imam descended from both grandsons of [[Muhammad]]: [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. He is revered by [[Shia Islam|Shiite Muslims]] for his religious leadership, and respected by [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] for his knowledge and Islamic scholarship as a jurist in [[Medina]].&lt;ref name="Qarashi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharif al-Qarashi|first1=Baqir|title=The Life of Imam Mohammed al-Baqir; Chapter VI &amp; VIII |others= Translated by Jasim al-Rasheed| year=1999|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|location=Qum, Islamic Republic of Iran|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/9aby6sf9pjgdqdp/The%20Life%20of%20Imam%20Al%20Baqir%20%28AS%29.pdf|isbn=964-438-044-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tabatabai"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabatabai|first1=Muhammad Husayn|title= Shiite Islam|others=Translated and Edited by Seyyed Hossein Nasr|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1975|pp=68,179|isbn=0-87395-390-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early life==
Al-Baqir had a prominent lineage: his paternal and maternal grandfathers, Husayn ibn Ali and Hasan ibn Ali, were Muhammad's grandsons. His father was Ali Zayn al-Abidin, a son of Husayn (Ali's second son), and his mother was Fatima Umm Abd Allah, a daughter of Hasan (Ali's first son).

Al-Baqir was born in [[Medina]] around 56 [[Hijri year|AH]] (676 AD), when [[Muawiyah I]] was trying to ensure that his son [[Yazid I]] could inherit the caliphate. When Al-Baqir was a child, his family was affected by the [[Battle of Karbala]]; he was three or four years old when his grandfather, Husayn, was killed.

According to [[Tarikh al-Yaqubi|Ya'qubi]], al-Baqir was present at [[Karbala]]. In his youth he witnessed the struggle for power among the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]] and a number of Shiite parties, whilst his father maintained a distance from local political activity.&lt;ref name="Lalani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lalani|first1=Arzina R.|title=Early Shi'i Thought: The Teachings of Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir|date=March 9, 2001|publisher=I.

=={{anchor|Al-Baqir}}Name==
Al-Baqir is an abbreviation of ''Baqir al-'ilm'', which means "he who opens knowledge", and al-Baqir is said to have been known for his knowledge. According to [[Ibn Khallikan]], he received the nickname ''"al-Baqir"'' (the ample) due to the "ample fund of knowledge" he collected. However, Ya'qubi believed that he was called al-Baqir because he "split open knowledge", examining its depths.{{efn|See [[Ibn Khallikan]], trans. de Slane, Vol. II, p. 579 and [[Tarikh al-Yaqubi|Ya'qubi]], History, Vol. II, p. 384.}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; The Shiites believe that ''Baqir al-'ilm'' was not an ordinary title, because it was given to him by Muhammad. According to [[Kitab al-Kafi|al-Kulayni]], Muhammad's only living companion [[Jabir ibn Abd Allah]] would sit in the mosque and cry: ''"Ya baqir al-ilm, Ya baqir al-ilm''". Although Medinans thought that Jabir was insane, he assured them that Muhammad had told him: "O Jabir! You will meet a man from my family who will have the same name and the same characteristics as mine. He will split open knowledge extensively."&lt;ref name="Lalani"/&gt; According to [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|al-Kulayni]], [[Jabir ibn Abd Allah]] met al-Baqir when passing a Quran school. Abd Allah saw that the imam was still a child, and examined him to see if he had the features which Muhammad had described. Jabir asked, "Characteristics of the Messenger of Allah; by Him in whose hands is my soul, O boy, what is your name?"&lt;ref name="Lalani"/&gt; When al-Baqir answered that he was Muhammad ibn Ali ibn al-Husayn, Jabir "approached him, kissed his head and swore by his father and mother that [[Muhammad]] had recited greeting upon him."&lt;ref name="Lalani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;. According to al-Kafi, Imam Baqir stressed the importance of intelligence saying that Allah will hold everyone accountable on the day of judgement according to the degree of intelligence they received in the worldly life. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=={{anchor|Imamah}}Imamate==
During the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imamah]] of Muhammad al-Baqir, riots erupted throughout the Islamic world due to the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]'s oppression. Disagreements within the Umayyad party kept them occupied, and they left [[Ahl al-Bayt|members of the household]] undisturbed for some time. However, tyranny in the Battle of Karbala had attracted many people to the imams. These conditions had permitted people (particularly the Shiites) to travel to Medina in large groups and visit the imam freely. The possibility of spreading Islam (which had not existed for the previous imams) was available to the fifth imam, indicated by a number of [[Hadith|traditions]] about the imam and scholars trained under him.{{efn| See the books of biographies of famous men in Islam such as Irshad, pp.245-253. See also Kitab rijal al-Kashshi by Muhammad ibn Muhammad ibn ’Abd al-’Aziz Kashshi, Bombay, 1317; Kitab rijal al- Tusi by Muhammad ibn Hasan Tusi, Najaf, 1381; Kitab-i fihrist of Tusi, Calcutta, 1281: and other books of biography.}}&lt;ref name="tabatabai"/&gt;

===Division===
After the death of [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]] (the fourth Imam), most of the Shiites agreed upon his son al-Baqir as the next imam; a minority favored another son of the imam ([[Zayd ibn Ali]]), and became known as [[Zaidiyyah]]. According to [[Ibn Khallikan]],{{efn|See Ibn Khallikan, trans. [[William McGuckin de Slane|de Slane]], Vol. III, p. 274.}} Zaid (Muhammad al-Baqir's brother), appealed for people to support his cause. According to [[Al-Masudi]], he asked for advice from Muhammad al-Baqir; al-Baqir advised him not to rely on the people of [[Kufa]], explaining how they had previously behaved toward the members of his household. Zaid did not listen to his brother's advice, and led the people of [[Kufa]] in a fruitless riot.

According to [[Al-Shahrastani]],{{efn|See Shahrastani, Kjtab al-milal wa'l-nihal(The Book of Religious and Philosophical Sects) edit. [[William Cureton|Cureton]], p. 116 ff. }} a dispute had arisen between Muhammad al-Baqir and Zaid because Zaid had been following the [[Mu'tazila|Mu'tazilite]] Wasil ibn  Ata. Zaid had also announced that the position of imam was conditional on his appearing publicly to assert his rights. Muhammad al-Baqir replied, "Your faith then is merely in [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|your father]], as such, for according to your theory he was not an imam, for he certainly never came forth to assert his claims."&lt;ref name="tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

=={{anchor|Under the Umayyad Rulers}}Under the Umayyad rulers==
Despite his non-involvement in political activities, the [[Umayyad]] rulers harassed Muhammad al-Baqir. Many [[Shia Islam|Shia]] individuals and delegations came to [[Medina]] from [[Kufa]] to hear al-Baqir's teachings and ask him questions,&lt;ref name="DakakeCharisma"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dakake, Maria Massi|year=2007|title=The Charismatic Community: Shi'ite Identity in Early Islam|page=72|location=USA|publisher=State Univ of New York Pr|isbn=978-0-7914-7033-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; among which was who had the right to rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Meri | first=Josef W | authorlink=Josef W Meri | year=2005 | title=Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia | page=523| edition=1st | publisher=[[Routledge]] | isbn=978-0-415-96690-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also distrusted because of the uprising of his brother [[Zayd ibn Ali]] and other relatives.

Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], where Mohammed al-Baqir and his son [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] were present. At a gathering, al-Baqir delivered a sermon: "We are the favorite and chosen servants of God, and His vicegerents on the face of the earth. One who obeys us is successful and one who opposes would be evil and wretched."&lt;ref name="Qarashi"/&gt; His statements were conveyed to [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Hisham]], who wrote to the governor of [[Medina]] when he returned to his court in [[Syria]] instructing him to send al-Baqir and his son to [[Damascus]]. When they arrived, he kept them waiting for three days; on the fourth he called them to court, where he was practicing archery with his officials.&lt;ref name="Qarashi"/&gt;

==Works==

===''Ma'athiru'l-Baqir''===
In ''Ma'athiru'l-Baqir'' the imam discussed a number of topics, from the nature of the soul and the qualities of the [[Ulama]] to the attributes of God and the divine nature (explaining that it was impossible for humans to understand it). A man asked him, "Should I think of anything (to understand Allah)?" The imam replied: "Yes, but you have to imagine a thing which the mind cannot contain and which is without limit. He is unlike whatever comes into your mind. Nothing resembles Him nor can any thought reach Him."&lt;ref name="Qarashi"/&gt; He also said, "Talk about the creation of Allah, but do not talk about Allah Himself, for that increases the owner of the talk nothing except perplexity."&lt;ref name="Qarashi"/&gt; He defined a [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Rasul]] as a prophet who hears and sees the angel in bodily form or in a dream. A [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Nabi]] is a prophet who hears but does not see the angel, and the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imam]] is like the Nabi.{{efn|The Imams, he asserts, are pure and free from the sin; that the world was under their rule, that through them the eye of God mercy falls on men; that if they did not exist, men would perish, and that they should not fear though worthless fellows might deny all this.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;}}
The imam was frequently asked to explain teachings about the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imamate]], which is also explained in ''Ma'athiru'l-Baqir'' (a summary of which is translated into English in [[Edward Sell (priest)|Canon Sell]]'s ''Ithna ʻAsharíyya'' or ''The Twelve Shiʻah Imams''.{{efn|An interesting part of which that shows the intellectual and spiritual character of the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]] goes as follows: A man once asked the Imam, "Was the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] heir to all the knowledge of the [[Prophets in Islam|prophets]]?" He replied, " Yes"; then he was asked if he had inherited it. He said he had. He was then asked whether he could raise the dead to life, restore sight to the blind, and cleanse the leper. He said, "Yes, by the valour of God Most High." He thus put his hand on the eyes of a man and blinded him, and then brought back his sight. Many more such stories are told.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;}}&lt;ref name="Qarashi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sell|first1=Edward|title=Ithna Asharíyya, or The twelve Shi'ah Imams, pp. 18-19.  Publisher:|date=1923|publisher=Christian Literature Society for India|location=Madras, India|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about collective knowledge of the [[Quran]], Imam al-Baqir would say that no one collected and memorized the Holy Book as Allah revealed it except [[Muhammad]], [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]] and the Imams of [[Ahl al-Bayt]] after him. Further, no one is able to claim that they have knowledge of the entire Quran, its apparent and hidden essence, except the executors of the will of the Holy Prophet. &lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''Umm al-Kitab''===
''[[Umm al-Kitab (Ismaili book)|Umm al-Kitab]]'', or ''The Archetype of the Book'', is in the form of a discussion between the imam and three companions. Resembling the ''[[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]]'', it illustrates the similarity between [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imamology]] and gnostic [[Christology]]. A major concept of this work is the description of the [[numinous]] experience. Its central motif is the psychological and philosophical explanation of spiritual symbols, with believers instructed to perform acts of self-purification and renewal. Colors are used to symbolize theories and levels of consciousness which one must recognize in oneself.&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corbin|first1=Henry|title=The History of Islamic Philosophy|date=2001|publisher=Kegan Paul International|others=Translated by Liadain Sherrard with the assistance of Philip Sherrard|location=London and New York|pages=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Tafsir al-Baqir'' ===
[[:fa:تفسیر الباقر|Tafsir al-baqir]], or ''Tafsir Abul Jaroud'', is al-Baqir's [[exegesis]] of the [[Quran]]. [[Ibn al-Nadim]] included this book in his list of exegeses of the Quran in his ''Kitab al-Fihrist'', writing that Abul Jaroud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad (the head of the [[Zaidiyyah#Status of Caliphs and the Sahaba|Jarudiyya]]) reported al-Baqir's book. According to Sayyd Hasan al-Sadr, "A group of the reliable Shiites reported the book from him [Abul Jaroud] from the days of his righteousness"; among them was Abu Basïr Yahya bin al-Qasim al-Asadi. Ali bin Ibrahï~m bin Hashim al-Qummi also mentioned it in his book, ''al-Tafsïr'', by the authority of Abu Basïr.&lt;ref name="Qarashi"/&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Grave Fatema(single one) and other Imams.JPG|thumb|alt=Low stone wall with remains of sarcophagi next to modern buildings|The imam's [[demolition of al-Baqi|desecrated grave]] at [[al-Baqi']] in Saudi Arabia]]
Imam died on 7th Dhu al-Hijjah. Imam al-Baqir was poisoned by Caliph [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]]. According to the Shi'i account, the Caliph gave Zaid a saddle treated with poison; Zaid gave it to the Imam, who used it and died. Al-Baqir was laid to rest under the dome in [[al-Baqi']], where the Imams [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin]] were buried.&lt;ref name="tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; The grave was [[demolition of al-Baqi|demolished by the Wahhabis]] in 1806, later rebuilt by believers, and then demolished again in 1926.

'''Mystery meat''' is a disparaging term for [[meat]] products, typically [[ground meat|ground]] or otherwise [[processed food|processed]], such as [[Patty|burger patties]], [[chicken nugget]]s, [[Spam (food)|Spam]], [[Salisbury steak]]s, [[sausage]]s, or [[hot dog]]s, that have an unidentifiable [[Ingredient|source]].  Most often the term is used in reference to food served in institutional [[cafeteria]]s, such as [[prison food]] or an American [[state school|public school]] [[school meal|lunch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett-school-to-become-192520.html |title= Gwinnett County news from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |website= www.ajc.com |access-date= 2009-11-18 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101218211519/http://www.ajc.com/news/gwinnett-school-to-become-192520.html |archive-date=2010-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2004-09-12-organic-food-schools_x.htm USATODAY.com - No more mystery meat!

The term is also sometimes applied to meat products where the [[species]] from which the meat has come from is known, but the [[cuts of meat]] used are unknown. This is often the case where the cuts of meat used include [[offal]] and [[mechanically separated meat]], where explicitly stating the type of meat used might diminish the perceived palatability of the product to some consumers.

}} 
The '''Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39 TC# 2.A.39]) consists of over 1000 currently sequenced proteins derived from [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria|Gram-positive]] bacteria, [[archaea]], fungi and plants. These proteins function as transporters for nucleobases including [[purines]] and [[pyrimidines]]. Members of this family possess twelve transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). At least some of them have been shown to function in uptake by substrate:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport mechanism.

==Phylogeny==
The bacterial and yeast proteins are widely divergent and do not cluster closely on the NCS1 family phylogenetic tree. ''B. subtilis'' possesses two paralogues of the NCS1 family, and ''S. cerevisiae'' has several. Two of the yeast proteins (Dal4 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.1 TC# 2.A.39.3.1]) and Fur4 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.3.2 TC# 2.A.39.3.2])) cluster tightly together. Three other ''S. cerevisiae'' proteins, one of which is the thiamin permease, Thi10 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.1 TC# 2.A.39.4.1]), and another of which is the nicotinamide riboside transporter, Nrt1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.2 TC# 2.A.39.4.2]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belenky PA, Moga TG, Brenner C | title = Saccharomyces cerevisiae YOR071C encodes the high affinity nicotinamide riboside transporter Nrt1 | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 13 | pages = 8075–9 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18258590 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.C800021200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also cluster tightly together. The latter three proteins are likely to be closely related thiamin permease isoforms. The yeast cytosine-purine and vitamin B6 transporters cluster loosely together (24% identity; e-50).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stolz J, Vielreicher M | title = Tpn1p, the plasma membrane vitamin B6 transporter of Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 278 | issue = 21 | pages = 18990–6 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12649274 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M300949200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bacterial proteins are derived from several Gram-negative and Gram-positive species. These proteins exhibit limited sequence similarity with the xanthine permease, PbuX ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39.4.1 TC# 2.A.39.4.1]), of ''Bacillus subtilis'' which is a member of the [[Nucleobase cation symporter-2|NCS2 family]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.39#ref34543773|title = 2.A.39 The Nucleobase:Cation Symporter-1 (NCS1) Family|date = |access-date = |website = Transporter Classification Database|publisher = Saier Lab Bioinformatics Group / SDSC|last = Saier|first = MH Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and Function==
Proteins of the NCS1 family are 419-635 amino acyl residues long and possess twelve putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). At least some of them have been shown to function in uptake by substrate:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symport. In these respects, and with respect to substrate specificity, these proteins resemble the symporters of the [[Nucleobase cation symporter-2|NCS2 family]], providing further evidence that the two families represent distant constituents of a single superfamily, the [[APC Superfamily]]. The two families probably arose by an early gene duplication event that occurred long before divergence of the three major kingdoms of life. It is possible that they are distant constituents of the MFS (2.A.1).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The nucleobase-cation-symport-1 (NCS1) transporters are essential components of salvage pathways for [[nucleobase]]s and related metabolites. Weyand et al.

The reciprocal opening and closing of these cavities is synchronized by the inverted repeat helices 3 and 8, providing the structural basis of the alternating access model for membrane transport.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Substrates===
NCS1 proteins are H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; symporters specific for the uptake of purines, pyrimidines and related metabolites. Krypotou et al. 2015 studied the origin, diversification and substrate specificities of fungal NCS1 transporters, suggesting that the two fungal NCS1 subfamilies, Fur and Fcy, and plant homologues, originated through independent horizontal transfers from prokaryotes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Krypotou E, Evangelidis T, Bobonis J, Pittis AA, Gabaldón T, Scazzocchio C, Mikros E, Diallinas G | title = Origin, diversification and substrate specificity in the family of NCS1/FUR transporters | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 96 | issue = 5 | pages = 927–50 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25712422 | doi = 10.1111/mmi.12982 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expansion by gene duplication led to functional diversification of fungal NCS1 porters. They characterized all Fur proteins in Aspergillus nidulans. Homology modelling, substrate docking, molecular dynamics and systematic mutational analysis in three Fur transporters with distinct specificities identified residues critical for function and specificity, located within a major substrate binding site, in transmembrane segments TMS1, TMS3, TMS6 and TMS8. They predicted and confirmed that residues determining substrate specificity are located not only in the major substrate binding site, but also in a putative outward-facing selectivity gate. Their evolutionary and structure-function analyses led to the concept that selective channel-like gates may contribute to substrate specificity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Transport Reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NCS1 family permeases is:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

:Nucleobase or Vitamin (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Nucleobase or Vitamin (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)

The '''Orussidae''' or the '''parasitic wood wasps''' represent a small family of [[sawflies]] ("[[Symphyta]]"). Currently, about 85 extant and four fossil species are known.&lt;ref name=BlankEtAl2012&gt;[http://sdei.senckenberg.de/ecatsym/ Blank, S.M., Groll, E.K., Liston, A.D., Prous, M. &amp; Taeger, A. 2012: ECatSym - Electronic World Catalog of Symphyta (Insecta, Hymenoptera). Program version 4.0 beta, data version 39 (18. Dezember 2012). Digital Entomological Information, Müncheberg]&lt;/ref&gt; They take a key position in phylogenetic analyses of [[Hymenoptera]], because they form the sister taxon of the megadiverse [[apocrita]]n wasps, and the common ancestor of Orussidae + Apocrita invented parasitism for the first time in course of the evolution of the Hymenoptera. They are also the only sawflies with carnivorous larvae.

==Description==

=== Adults ===
The fully winged wasps are 2−23&amp;nbsp;mm long. They are predominantly black but species of ''Chalinus'', ''Mocsarya'' and ''Orussobaius'' are more or less metallic. Some species have a red thorax or abdomen and conspicuous white or golden pilosity. Many ''Orussus'' species bear white spots on the legs. The antennae of males are composed of 11, those of females of 10 articles. The modified distal antennal articles of females (article 9 enlarged, article 10 very small) are involved in vibrational sounding to detect suitable oviposition sites and the host larvae living concealed inside wood.&lt;ref name=VilhelmsenEtAl2001&gt;Vilhelmsen, L., Isidoro, N., Romani, R., Basibuyuk, H.H. &amp; Quicke, D.L.J. 2001: Host location and oviposition in a basal group of parasitic wasps: the subgenual organ, ovipositor apparatus and associated structures in the Orussidae (Hymenoptera, Insecta). Zoomorphology 121: 63-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to other "Symphyta", the antennae insert near the lower edge of the compound eyes and close to the mandible. The mandibles are [[orthognathous]] and lack evident teeth. The number of palpomeres of the maxilla and the labium varies and is used as a taxonomic character. On the wings, some cross-veins are reduced in comparison with the more complete venation of other basal Hymenoptera. Similar as in most other sawflies, the wings are held at rest with a device called "cenchri". The complete body is strongly sclerotized and bears a species-specific microstructure, which is relevant for species identification. The ovipositor is several times as long as the body, and at rest it extends inside the body from the abdomen to the prothorax, where it is coiled, and back towards the tip of the abdomen again.

Orussidae and [[Stephanidae]] are the sole Hymenoptera, in which the head bears a corona of erected teeth around the frontal ocellus. Contrary to Orussidae, the Stephanidae lack cenchri, and their [[mesosoma]] and [[metasoma]] are separated by a wasp waist, which is absent in Orussidae.

===Larvae===
Similar to the larvae of [[apocrita]]n Hymenoptera, larvae of Orussidae have reduced some morphological features as a result of their parasitic life style inside the tunnels of wood-boring insects. They are white, [[subcylindrical]], weakly sclerotized with a distinct head capsule. The mouthparts are [[hypognathous]]. Eyes and legs are reduced or completely absent. The mandibles are well developed and strongly sclerotized. Palps of maxilla and labium lack. The surface of the body is subdivided into distinct segments, each bearing a transverse row of 8−10 backward pointing spines.&lt;ref name=RohwerCushman1917&gt;Rohwer, S.A. &amp; Cushman, R.A. 1917: Idiogastra, a new suborder of Hymenoptera with notes on the immature stages of ''Oryssus''. Proceedings of the entomological Society of Washington 19(1-4): 89-98.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biology and behavior ==
Orussid wasps have generally been collected only rarely. Over the years, their [[abundance (ecology)|abundance]] has been subject to strong fluctuations.&lt;ref name=BurgerTaeger1994&gt;Burger, F. &amp; Taeger, A. 1994: Aktuelle Nachweise von ''Orussus abietinus'' (Scopoli, 1763) (Hymenoptera, Orussidae). Brandenburgische Entomologische Nachrichten 2(1): 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; The species are [[thermophilous]] and wasps are active during the hottest hours of the day. Therefore, they are rarely found by the entomologists specialized in sawflies.

Only for few species the larval biology is known. Orussidae are parasitoids of xylobiontic larvae of beetles or Hymenoptera, particularly of the larvae of jewel beetles ([[Buprestidae]]), long-horned beetles ([[Cerambycidae]]), and wood wasps ([[Siricidae]], [[Xiphydriidae]]).&lt;ref name=Rawlings1957&gt;Rawlings, G.B. 1957: ''Guiglia schauinslandi'' (Ashmead) (Hym. Orussidae) a parasite of ''Sirex noctilio'' (Fabricius) in New Zealand. Entomologist 90(1125): 35-36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kraus1998&gt;Kraus, M. 1998: Die Orussidae Europas und des Nahen Ostens (Hymenoptera: Orussidae). Pp. 283-300. In: Taeger, A. &amp; Blank, S. M. (eds): Pflanzenwespen Deutschlands (Hymenoptera, Symphyta). Kommentierte Bestandsaufnahme. Goecke &amp; Evers, Keltern.&lt;/ref&gt; Orussids can be observed running around quickly on dead tree trunks. The females locate the host larvae living concealed inside wood by generating vibrations by tapping the tips of their antennae against the wood surface. The vibrations are picked up by the modified fore legs.&lt;ref name=VilhelmsenEtAl2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=VilhelmsenTurrisi2011&gt;Vilhelmsen, L. &amp; Turrisi, G.F. 2011: Per arborem ad astra: Morphological adaptations to exploiting the woody habitat in the early evolution of Hymenoptera. Arthropod Structure &amp; Development 40: 2-20. {{doi|10.1016/j.asd.2010.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; After locating the host, the female drills into the wood with the very long [[ovipositor]] and lays the egg. The egg is very elongate with a small expansion on the anterior end and a long expansion on the posterior end. The egg is coiled on the host.&lt;ref name=Rawlings1957/&gt; In some species the egg is possibly laid into the tunnel of the host if the host itself can not be reached, and the orussid larva itself crawls to the host. On its way to the host it may gnaw through the wood shavings left by the host. It has been disputed whether this material contributes to the nutrition of the larva. At least in ''Guiglia schauinslandi'', the larva lives externally for its first two instars and then enters the putrid(?) liquid in the dead host, where it remains until the adult emerges.&lt;ref name=Rawlings1957/&gt;

==Systematics==

Numerous morphological and genetic studies indicate that the Orussidae form the sister taxon of the [[Apocrita]], the wasps, bees, and ants.&lt;ref name=Vilhelmsen2001Phyl&gt;Vilhelmsen, L. 2001: Phylogeny and classification of the extant basal lineages of the Hymenoptera (Insecta). Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 131: 393-442.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SharkeyEtAl2012&gt;Sharkey, M.J., Carpenter, J.M., Vilhelmsen, L., Heraty, J., Liljeblad, J., Dowling, A.P.G., Schulmeister, S., Murray, D., Deans, A.R., Ronquist, F., Krogmann, L., Wheeler, W.C. 2012: Phylogenetic relationships among superfamilies of Hymenoptera. Cladistics 28: 80-112. {{doi|10.1111/j.1096-0031.2011.00366.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, parasitic life style has not evolved first in Apocrita but in the common ancestor of Orussidae + Apocrita.

Earlier, the Orussidae were sometimes put into a separate suborder, Idiogastra,&lt;ref name=RohwerCushman1917/&gt; but today they are classified with an own superfamily, Orussoidea.&lt;ref name=Vilhelmsen2001Phyl/&gt;&lt;ref name=TaegerEtAl2010&gt;Taeger, A., Blank, S.M. &amp; Liston, A.D. 2010: World Catalog of Symphyta (Hymenoptera). Zootaxa 2580: 1-1064. [http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2010/f/z02580p1064f.pdf Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Orussidae are demonstrably monophyletic.&lt;ref name=Vilhelmsen2001Phyl/&gt; Tribes and subfamilies within the Orussidae have been abandoned, since such earlier subdivisions could not be corroborated in phylogenetic analyses.&lt;ref name=Vilhelmsen2003/&gt;

The cladogram is based on Schulmeister 2003. The Orussoidea are sister to the [[Apocrita]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schulmeister, S. |date=2003 |title=Simultaneous analysis of basal Hymenoptera (Insecta), introducing robust-choice sensitivity analysis |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=245–275 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00233.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schulmeister |first1=S. |title='Symphyta' |url=http://susanne.schulmeister.com/Symphyta.html |accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fossils==
The extant Orussidae are believed to have originated in the Jurassic. Fossils have been reported from the Lower Jurassic of [[Grimmen]] ([[Toarcian|Lower Toarcian]], Germany) and the Middle Jurassic of [[Daohugou Beds|Daohugou]] (China), which display a mixture of characters associated with Orussoidea and with basal Apocrita, thus it is impossible to classify these specimens which one of these clades.&lt;ref name=RasnitsynEtAl2006&gt;Rasnitsyn, A.P., Ansorge, J. &amp; Zhang, H. 2006: Ancestry of the orussoid wasps, with description of three new genera and species of Karatavitidae (Hymenoptera = Vespida: Karatavitoidea stat. nov.).

'''Parallax''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] in the [[DC Comics]] [[DC Universe|universe]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Ron Marz]] and artist [[Darryl Banks]] for ''[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]'' vol. 3, #48 (January 1994), Parallax was originally devised as the new supervillain identity for then-former Green Lantern protagonist [[Hal Jordan]]. After further changes for the Hal Jordan character over the subsequent years (sacrificing his life in order to reignite Earth’s Sun in the 1996 crossover storyline "[[The Final Night]]", and Jordan’s soul subsequently becoming the newest host of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] in the 1999 miniseries ''Day of Judgment''), 2004's ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'' once again cast Jordan as a heroic [[Green Lantern]] and explained Parallax as an ancient entity embodying the yellow light of fear which possessed Jordan and drove him to villainous action. Parallax was revealed to have been once imprisoned within the Central Power Battery on the planet [[Oa]], from which all Green Lanterns derive their power, and was the reason for the necessary impurity that in the past rendered the rings useless against anything colored yellow.

In 2009, Parallax was ranked as IGN's 92nd Greatest Comic Book Villain of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/92.html | title=Parallax is number 92 | work=[[IGN]] | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508085241/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/92.html | archivedate=2009-05-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
[[File:Parallax (Hal Jordan).png|thumb|left|Hal Jordan becomes Parallax. {{Descript-inner-art|[[Green Lantern (comic book)|Green Lantern]]|3|#50|March 1994|art=[[Darryl Banks]]|pub=DC}}]]
In 1994, in an effort to generate interest in its [[Green Lantern]] comics, DC replaced [[Hal Jordan]], who had been the primary Green Lantern since the late 1950s, with the character [[Kyle Rayner]], and eliminated the [[Green Lantern Corps]] which had served as supporting characters in the series. This was done in the story "[[Emerald Twilight]]", beginning ''Green Lantern'' vol. 3, #48 (Jan. 1994). Following the complete destruction of his home town [[Coast City]] by the villain [[Mongul]], [[Hal Jordan]] descends into madness, destroying the [[Green Lantern Corps]], killing his friend [[Kilowog]] and all of the [[Guardians of the Universe|Guardians]] except for [[Ganthet]]. After this, Jordan assumed the name Parallax and became a supervillain. As detailed in the crossover ''[[Zero Hour: Crisis in Time]]'', Parallax attempted to rewrite history in order to stop the destruction of Coast City by using chronal energy, pulled from the universe by the combined power of the rings of the Green Lanterns he had killed. While Kyle Rayner became the primary Green Lantern of Earth for the next decade, Hal Jordan terrorized the DC universe as the villain Parallax and attempted to make the Cyborg Superman pay for the destruction of Coast City.

Hal eventually sacrificed his life to reignite Earth's sun after it was nearly completely eaten. His soul not at peace, Hal then became the new [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] to seek redemption for what he did as Parallax. The 2004 miniseries ''[[Green Lantern: Rebirth]]'', written by [[Geoff Johns]] and penciled by [[Ethan Van Sciver]], revealed that Parallax was actually a parasitic entity dating back to the dawn of time and born from the yellow of the emotional spectrum. The parasite was the sentient embodiment of fear, traveling from world to world and causing entire civilizations to destroy themselves out of paranoia.

The Guardians of the Universe imprisoned Parallax within the Central Power Battery on [[Oa]] using fear's opposite energy, willpower, along with the aid of one of the fear's counterparts, [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]]. Parallax had lain dormant for billions of years, its true nature hidden by the Guardians to prevent anyone from trying to free it. Being yellow in color, Parallax eventually came to be referred to as simply "the yellow impurity", a flaw, whose nature was kept secret from the Corps, that made their rings useless against the color yellow: Parallax weakened its power over the corresponding spectrum; hence, only someone with the willpower to overcome great fear could master the [[Power ring (DC Comics)|power ring]]. Thus, when recruiting new [[Green Lanterns]], the Guardians were careful to look for recruits who could do this. When the renegade [[Sinestro]] was later imprisoned in the Power Battery himself, his [[Qward]]ian yellow power ring tapped into Parallax's power and awakened it.

Since Sinestro harbored hatred for Hal, Parallax chose Jordan as its tool to free itself. Parallax apparently spent years influencing Jordan, causing him to experience increasing self-doubt as well as causing his hair to prematurely whiten at the temples. Jordan's grief over the destruction of Coast City let Parallax influence Jordan's subsequent murderous activity, his apparent killing of Sinestro (actually a hard light construct), and Jordan's destruction of the Central Power Battery.

After it was learned something amiss was happening on Oa, a task force (as shown in the ''Emerald Fallout'' series), which consisted of [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], [[Wonder Woman]], [[Captain Atom]], [[Alan Scott]], [[Martian Manhunter]], Ferrin Colos of the [[Darkstars]], and [[Arisia Rrab|Arisia]], ventured to Oa to discover the cause of Guy Gardner's visions of its destruction that were brought about by him wielding Sinestro's power ring (which was also fueled by the power expelled by the Guardians, their rings, batteries, or Parallax himself). On Oa, the task force confronted Hal, but he easily defeated them. Only Alan Scott and Guy Gardner were even able to manage to get a hit on Jordan. Guy proved to be the most effective against Jordan because he could absorb the energy that Jordan was using against him in the battle. Jordan still managed to quickly overpower Guy and destroy his Qwardian power ring. Jordan proceeded to send the whole task force (who were all knocked out from the beating they suffered) back to Earth.

Since Parallax was gone from the Oan Power Battery, the final power ring conferred to [[Kyle Rayner]] did not have any weakness against yellow. The young ring bearer also has some limited resistance to the fear entity's influence as Rayner is a Green Lantern who understands fear, and has the requisite strong will of a ring bearer. Despite being possessed by Parallax, the positive aspect of Jordan's personality would resurface occasionally, eventually leading the infected Jordan to use Parallax's powers to reignite the Sun during the event known as "[[The Final Night]]", and later aiding the universe's greatest heroes to stop the rogue angel [[Asmodel]] from raising Hell to Earth and Heaven in ''[[Day of Judgment (comics)|Day of Judgment]]''. Jordan's infected soul later bonded with the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], who knew Parallax's true nature from the start and eventually expelled it from Jordan. The Spectre itself left to search for the next human host. Ganthet guided Jordan's soul back to his own body, preserved after Jordan reignited the Sun. His soul and thoughts finally gaining clarity for the first time in years, Jordan was resurrected, again taking his place as a [[Green Lantern]]. Together, [[Kyle Rayner]] and fellow Green Lanterns [[John Stewart (comics)|John Stewart]], [[Guy Gardner (comics)|Guy Gardner]], a resurrected [[Kilowog]], Hal Jordan, and [[Ganthet]] imprisoned the parasite back in the Central Power Battery on Oa.

Despite this reintroduction of the "yellow impurity", which is now referred to as the "Parallax Fear Anomaly", the power rings' weakness against yellow no longer applies, as experienced wielders are now able to consciously recognize its source, and overcome the fear associated with it. It is still, however, a considerable weakness for new Green Lantern recruits and rookies, who must be taught the impurity's nature and how to combat it. During training, new recruits' rings may falter at times against yellow objects, and/or when a recruit is experiencing panic or fear.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps: Recharge'' #4 (December 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinestro]]'s [[Sinestro Corps]] captures [[Kyle Rayner]] with the intention of making him Parallax's new host. Sinestro reveals to Kyle the existence of [[Ion (DC Comics)|Ion]]. Sinestro also informs him that Ion is actually an energy entity that needs a host, similar to Parallax, and it is now attached to Kyle's soul. Sinestro removes the Ion entity from Kyle, who is immediately taken over by Parallax. Parallax then clothes itself in a new uniform (which appears as a combination of Kyle's original [[Green Lantern]] costume and the costume Hal Jordan wore as Parallax) and returns to Qward with the Sinestro Corps.

Parallax becomes a herald of the reborn [[Anti-Monitor]] alongside [[Hank Henshaw]], [[Superman-Prime]], and [[Sinestro]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps Special'' #1 (August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; After the massacre of several Green Lanterns, Parallax leads an assault against Hal Jordan, John Stewart, and Guy Gardner, and brings them to Qward.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #21 (September 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The "Lost Lanterns" arrive to rescue the captured Lanterns. During the battle, Parallax murders [[Jack T. Chance]] after making him experience his repressed fear of his abusive family.

During his possession by Parallax, Kyle witnesses everything that Parallax does, including his murder of Jack. Kyle and Parallax confront each other in a room constructed by Kyle’s memories. Kyle changes into Ion and fights Parallax and later conjures a power ring and his original costume. After fighting Parallax for a while, Kyle stabs Parallax with a pencil and regains his self-worth when he sees a painting that his mother painted several years ago. Kyle walks into the painting and ends up in a field walking towards a bright, green star.&lt;ref&gt;''Tales of the Sinestro Corps Presents: Parallax'' (November 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on Earth, Parallax is about to kill Hal’s brother and family when Hal confronts him just before his power ring runs out of power. Hal then tries to free Kyle by reminding him of how fearless his mother was even on her deathbed. Parallax then absorbs Hal into himself; this twofold increase of his powers upon combining the strength of both of his hosts turns him his natural yellow color and develop a costume that more closely resembles the one he wore when Jordan was his only host. Soon after, Guy comes to Parallax with Kyle's mother's painting. This, along with Hal's aid, allows Kyle to fight Parallax from within, and the two manage to escape from Parallax. Now in its original form, Parallax begins to attack Hal, Guy, John, and Kyle. Ganthet and [[Sayd]] arrive and imprison Parallax within the Earth Lanterns' four Power Batteries.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #24 (December 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of Parallax within the four Power Batteries has yet to be revealed.

In ''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #41 (2009), it was revealed in the third part of the Agent Orange arc that Parallax was once sealed in a box that [[Larfleeze]] had stolen from the Guardians of the Universe. The box was returned to the Guardians in exchange for the orange light of avarice.

==="Blackest Night"===
[[Image:Parallax's origin.jpg|thumb|The birth of Parallax.]]
While Jordan and his allies defend Coast City against the [[Black Lantern Corps]], the Black Lantern [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]] attempts to claim him. Believing that the Spectre fears Parallax, Hal Jordan has Ganthet summon the power batteries that currently held it. Once summoned, Hal allows Sinestro to release Parallax and, once it's free, provokes it into merging with him. A resulting explosion of yellow light quickly fades and soon reveals that Parallax is in full control of Hal and eager to challenge the Spectre once more.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #50 (March 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Parallax tears into the Black Lantern Spectre's body, freeing the real Spectre and destroying the facsimile. Parallax then attempts to destroy the Spectre, who uses his own fear for it, coupled with the love [[Carol Ferris]] feels for Hal, to separate Parallax from its host. Parallax is then pulled away by an unknown force to an unknown location.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #51 (April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

After Sinestro becomes a [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]], he views the history of the emotional spectrum, and discovers that the first creature in existence to feel fear had evolved into Parallax.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #52 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Brightest Day"===
[[File:Parallax (Barry Allen).jpg|thumb|150px|left|The [[Flash (Barry Allen)]] becomes a host of Parallax, from ''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #59 (November 2010).]]
Parallax is later revealed to have been transported to planet Ryut, where a [[Krona (comics)|cloaked villain]] trapped the fear entity in some kind of energy bubble and chained it to a monolith bearing the [[Sinestro Corps]] symbol.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #53 (June 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Around Parallax are other monoliths bearing the symbols of the other Lantern corps.

Later, when [[Hal Jordan]], the [[Flash (Barry Allen)]], and the rest of their allies try to find the emotional entities, they locate Parallax (apparently under the command of the mysterious figure) and the Scarlet Speedster becomes the latest host for the fear entity after it senses the hero's concerns for Jordan's safety from it.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #59 (November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; By inhabiting the living generator of the [[Speed Force]], Parallax is even more powerful by combining the extradimensional energy the speedster creates with its own powers. Despite this, the embodiment of fear still desires Hal Jordan as its host as they fight. However, an intervention by the [[Krona (comics)|mystery villain]] prevents Parallax's attempts, and reveals that Jordan now has the skills to resist it anyway. As the embodiment of compassion, Proselyte, began to free the Flash from Parallax's control by reigniting his emotion for compassion over his fear, the embodiment of hope, Adara, began fighting the cloaked villain, who reveals that all this is actually a ruse so that he could capture them all — which he does — revealing himself to be the renegade guardian [[Krona (comics)|Krona]].&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #60 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===War of the Green Lanterns===
When Krona attacks Oa, he places Parallax inside the Central Power Battery, restoring the yellow impurity and giving him control over almost all Green Lanterns.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #64 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Hal, John, Guy and Kyle are able to resist Parallax's influence due to their past experience with it, using the rings of the other six Corps to fight off Krona's forces long enough for Guy using the rings of the [[Red Lantern Corps]] and the [[Star Sapphire (comics)|Star Sapphires]] simultaneously to tear the Central Power Battery's shell away and remove Parallax.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors'' #10 (May 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; After Krona's defeat, Parallax escaped along with the other entities and is currently at large in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 4, #67 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, it is shown that Parallax is in the Yellow Central Power Battery where the entity stays until he is released by Sinestro at the conclusion of the "Wrath of the First Lantern" story. In order to destroy the First Lantern Volthoom, Sinestro allows Parallax to possess his body. Contrary to previous hosts of Parallax, this time however, Sinestro is in control of the entity instead of the other way around. Their effort in defeating Volthoom however proves to be unsuccessful, with Volthoom only being defeated when Hal returns as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] and summons [[Nekron]] to restore Volthoom's mortality. After Volthoom's defeat, Sinestro as Parallax proceeds to kill the Guardians of the Universe, sparing only Ganthet and Sayd in the process. Sinestro then states his intention to travel far from Oa and release Parallax.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 5, #20 (May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the "Lights Out" story, the Entity reveals that all embodiments are dying and they must return to the place of their [[Source Wall|origin]], except Parallax because its currently entrapped.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern Corps'' #23 (August 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath, its revealed that Parallax is still bonded with Sinestro, who controls the entity.&lt;ref&gt;''Sinestro'' #5 (August 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Sinestro releases and separate Parallax within the core of Warworld's base, trying to prevent the destruction of the new headquarters of Sinestro Corps, after the Green Lantern Corps were apparently dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;''Sinestro'' #13 (July 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sinestro'' #14 (August 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
Subsequently, in ''[[DC Rebirth]]'', Parallax was being the host of Sinestro again as he has plans to rule the universe with fear.&lt;ref&gt;''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #1 (July 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Parallax was increased by Sinestro to one thousand percent of the power of fear to face Hal Jordan, who has returned as Green Lantern.&lt;ref&gt;''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #6 (October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; Before Sinestro attacks him, he discovers too late that his and Parallax's powers have decreased due to [[Soranik Natu]] rescuing people from being imprisoned and escapes with them. Hal then uses his energies as a living construct to incinerate the Fear Warlord. Sinestro tries to use Parallax's powers to stop Hal, but fails as he destroys the base of the Sinestro Corps, Warworld, seemingly killing both Sinestro and Parallax in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #7 (October 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallax is revealed to have survived and found its way to Earth, having shrunk in size. It starts kidnapping children to feed on their fear and regain its strength and power. The entity possesses the body of one of the children, Zachariah Ferruci, and kidnaps another child until they are found by Superman. Parallax uses the children to fight back against Superman and flees. The next day, Parallax welcomes Superman to finds where it is keeping the children. Parallax transforms into his normal size and revealing to Superman who it is. Parallax tries to possess Superman but he is able to force it out. However, Parallax begins draining the children's lives, forcing Superman to submit. Parallax possesses Superman and as it claims that nothing can hurt it anymore, Parallax is struck from behind by Sinestro, who has returned to claim it for himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' vol. 4, #29 (August 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; During the fight, Parallax refused to possess Sinestro for his action, Sinestro teleports to Qward, as the Weaponers are to restrain the entity. While Parallax apparently possesses Superman in contain as Sinestro attempt to remove the host of Parallax, but Superman tells him that he is not being Parallax's control. Parallax is in possession of the Weaponers to attack Sinestro. Parallax separate from the Weaponers and tried to escapes. Sinestro failed to capture Parallax that his power has drained and collapses, Superman takes his yellow ring and files into Parallax's mouth, Superman used his fear to imprison Parallax within a yellow ring, while Sinestro is no match for Superman and flees.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' vol. 4, #30 (September 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Superman waits for Hal Jordan to return Earth, explaining the previous fight with Parallax. Hal imprisons Parallax within a yellow ring for transportation back to Mogo.&lt;ref&gt;''Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps'' #30 (October 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallax has immense fear-casting and mind-control powers, strong enough to easily frighten and control the likes of [[Superman]], [[Wonder Woman]], and even someone like [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], except those who are capable of understanding and conquering inner fear such as [[Hal Jordan]], [[Kyle Rayner]] or [[Batman]].&lt;ref name="GLR 6"&gt;''Green Lantern: Rebirth'' #6 (May 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was unable to control [[Alan Scott]] even though he experienced fear from Parallax ([[Abin Sur]] explains that in humans fear is intellectual, which may have something to do with the ineffectuality of Parallax's powers&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern: Emerald Dawn'' #1 (December 1989)&lt;/ref&gt; and the fear entity itself mentioned that Alan's power differs from the fear entity, the Guardians, and the Green Lantern Corps as they derive their powers from emotional spectrum&lt;ref name="GLR 6"/&gt;), although he did experience a fever which led him to increasingly weaken during Parallax's attempts. It can take possession of someone's body when they feel even the slightest fear. Parallax is also capable of creating solid light constructs, such as creating a convincing duplicate of Sinestro for Hal Jordan to kill. Parallax can create both green and yellow objects or creatures. As a being of pure energy, Parallax has no true physical form of its own; it generally changes into forms that will instill fear in its victims.

==Other versions==
* In ''[[Booster Gold (comic book)|Booster Gold]]'' vol. 2, #2 (2007), one panel shows an alternate timeline where the [[Sinestro Corps]] are formed years earlier than they should have been. In this alternate timeline, [[Tomar-Re]] is Parallax's host.
* In ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', the Parallax-possessed Hal Jordan makes a brief appearance, flying into a rage after the apparent death of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Clint Barton]] during the fight with [[Krona (comics)|Krona]], but the chronal chaos throughout the battlefield quickly replaces him with Kyle Rayner.
* Parallax is featured in the ''[[Smallville|Smallville Season 11]]'' digital comic based on the [[Smallville|TV series]].
* In the ''[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]'' crossover, when the alternate [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] miniaturized the universe of Zero Hour, Parallax loses his powers and Hal Jordan returns to his senses. Wanting to atone for the crimes and sins he committed, Hal has himself jailed within the 8th Police Precinct, and is visited regularly by Kyle Rayner. Hal Jordan becomes Parallax again after the dome of Telos releases the city in which Kyle Rayner as the Green Lantern is the only thing standing between Hal Jordan as Parallax and the oncoming doom Parallax plans to unleash upon Electropolis.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence: Green Lantern/Parallax'' #1 (April 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Parallax confronts Deimos, sick of being trapped on the planet but is attacked by the latter. When Deimos claims that nothing can stop him, Parallax attacks and chastises him for using his powers for his own selfish needs and destroys him. Afterwards, he threatens Telos to return everyone to their respective universes, but all the power Deimos took is suddenly released and will shatter the multiverse.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence'' #7&lt;/ref&gt; Parallax offers to save them but Telos stops him, refusing to let Parallax cause another Zero Hour-level event. Parallax chooses to go back to the Crisis on Infinite Earths with the pre-Crisis Flash, pre-Crisis Supergirl, and the pre-Flashpoint Superman and Lois Lane, to help prevent it from collapsing the multiverse, and to also redeem himself for the actions he has committed. Brainiac senses that the group were successful.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; After preventing the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Parallax (along with the pre-Flashpoint Superman and Lois Lane) finds himself on the New 52 Prime Earth and witnesses the Justice League's first fight with Darkseid. Parallax considered killing the New 52 Hal Jordan/Green Lantern but decided not to when he realized how happy Carol Ferris was with Hal, and he couldn't take that away from her. Parallax decided to find Telos and get his help. Parallax finds Telos and rescues him from an Alliance Fleet, destroying them in the process. He reveals that he wants to use the Rosetta Stone of Time that Telos has to create his own Coast City. He offers Telos the location of the latter's family but it is all a ruse and Parallax contains Telos and uses the stone to begin the creation of his Coast City.&lt;ref&gt;''Telos'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;
* While Hal is acting as a solo agent using an old gauntlet prototype for the rings, he is confronted by a version of himself as Parallax, apparently from the point when he was preparing to restructure time who has been drawn into the future. Proclaiming that he will protect this Coast City to ensure that Hal's 'weakness' will never cause him to fail it again, Parallax-Hal attacks Hal despite his efforts to explain what is actually happening to his 'past' self, but the gauntlet is somehow able to drive Parallax away.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' vol. 5, #50&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the ''Star Trek''/''Green Lantern'' crossover series- where key members of the Green Lantern Corps and other ring-wielders are transferred into the [[Star Trek (2009 film)|new ''Star Trek'' universe]] after an attack by [[Nekron]], Sinestro makes his way to Oa after uncovering evidence that it exists in his new universe, where he attacks the central power battery and absorbs Parallax into himself.&lt;ref&gt;''Star Trek/Green Lantern'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Films===
[[File:Parallax (film).jpg|300px|thumb|right|Parallax devours [[Hector Hammond]]'s fear and life force in ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''.]]
*Parallax appears as the main antagonist in the [[2011 in film|2011]] film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]'', voiced by [[Clancy Brown]] while his motion-capture was provided by an uncredited [[T.J. Storm]]. In the film, Parallax absorbs life forces by feeding on the yellow power of the fear created by living beings, and was created as a result of the Yellow Energy of fear possessing and corrupting [[Krona (comics)|Krona]]. [[Abin Sur]] had imprisoned the entity in the planet Ryut, but it later escapes and seeks revenge on the Green Lanterns and Oa, killing Abin. He travels around the universe, absorbing the living fear and life force of whole planets with intelligent life to increase his strength, then plans to destroy the Green Lantern Corps. Parallax uses [[Hector Hammond]] as a pawn in his plans, Hammond's powers being the result of exposure to a sample of Parallax while he was conducting Abin Sur's autopsy. After Hammond failed to destroy Hal Jordan, Parallax killed Hammond when he appears on Earth. Parallax then rampages on Earth, but Jordan manages to draw Parallax away from the planet, subsequently luring the monster close enough to the [[Sun]] that his sheer mass draws him in and is destroyed.

===Video games===
*Parallax appears in ''[[DC Universe Online]]''. He is the final boss of S.T.A.R. Labs Alert where he possesses Sinestro, [[Arkillo]], [[Kilowog]] and Hal Jordan. When each one is possessed, they end up changing; their faces darkening, their mouths stretching out and gaining the symbol of Parallax in their mouths.

The '''Parliament of Trees''' is a fictional group of Plant [[Elementals]] appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]], sometimes under its [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] imprint, which function as supporting characters to [[Swamp Thing]]. Created by writer [[Alan Moore]] and artist [[Stan Woch]], the Parliament first appeared in ''[[Swamp Thing (comic book)|Swamp Thing]]'' #47 (April 1986).  

==Fictional history==
{{unreferenced|section|date=December 2011}}
In Moore's storyline, Plant Elementals have existed on Earth long before humans. Born when a being dies in flames and merges with the Earth, the Elementals became protectors of plant life throughout history. When they had done their time, they would join the Parliament of Trees, a group mind of former Elementals. Over time the membership grew with beings such as Eyam (based on the form of a [[trilobite]]), Swamp [[Knucker]] (a dinosaur-like dragon), Bog Venus (patterned on the mind of a medicine woman), Ghost Hiding in the Rushes (a sorcerer of 3rd-century China), [[Swamp Thing]] (an early 20th-century scientist), and many others. Until recently, the Parliament was stationed in a grove in [[Brazil]], at south of the [[Tefé River]], while their minds dwelled in the realm of the Green.

Although preaching peace, the Parliament was involved in several conflicts in the past. Once united with the Parliament of Stones, the Parliament separated from the other to set in motion an elaborate plot to someday destroy mankind. The Parliament also had to fight off the fungus-based Grey, invaders from another world that eventually became the mushroom life of this planet. Quite recently, it was revealed that the Parliament of Trees (and other Elemental Parliaments) had an agenda with Swamp Thing that included the destruction of mankind and the re-making of Earth. To prevent that from happening, the Heavenly power called  [[The Word (comics)|The Word]] was sent to destroy the Parliament, but not until they had passed on all their power to the Swamp Thing, who would do their bidding. But Swamp Thing refused in the last second, giving humanity another chance. The Parliament of Trees is now eternally burning in the realm of the Green. A few of its former members have survived since they were not present during the massacre at the hands of The Word.

==="Brightest Day"===
During the climatic moments of the 2010-2011 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' miniseries, the [[White Lantern Corps|White Lantern]] reveals that "the Green has become black" and corrupted. It also states that the central tree in the Star City forest is the foundation for the Parliament of Trees.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #23 (April 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, it was shown that [[Alan Scott]], Earth 2's Green Lantern, receives his powers through an association with ''The Green''.&lt;ref&gt;''Earth 2'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; It was also revealed that besides the Parliament of Trees there are in fact four more Parliaments that together form the Earth's Parliament. The other four Parliaments consists of ''The Blue'' (also known as Clear) who represents the power of the oceans and is heralded by the enigmatic Parliament of Waves, ''The Grey'' (also known as Rot) who embody decay and appears to be heralded by the Parliament of Decay, ''The Red'' who stand for animal savagery and is heralded by the Parliament of Limbs, ''The White'' who stand for the power of the atmosphere which is heralded by a still unnamed Parliament. The members of this Parliament Enclave only meet when the Earth is in perilous danger such as Darkseid's invasion of Earth 2 to summon their avatars who embody the spirits to enact their will.

==The Green==
'''The Green''' is a mystical realm inhabited by the minds of all members of the Parliament of Trees, and it is a phenomenon that connects all forms of botanical life on earth. It is in the same category as '''The Red''' (which is connected to all animal life and run by the Parliament of Limbs), '''The Clear''' (which is associated with aquatic life and run by the Parliament of Vapors), an unnamed fire realm (which is associated with fire elementals and connected to the Parliament of Flames, which resides in the Earth's sun), '''The Melt''' (which is connected to Earth elementals and run by the Parliament of Stones), '''The Grey''' (which is connected to all fungal life), and '''The Black''' (which is associated with [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]], was also called '''The Rot''', and run by the Parliament of Decay). Various plant elementals of the [[DC Universe|DCU]] have been known to communicate with the Green as well and appear to have an in-tune rapport with it. These select few include the following:
* [[Black Orchid (comics)|Black Orchid]] (Flora Black and Suzy)
* [[Hyathis]] (ruler of the planet Alstair)
* [[Poison Ivy (character)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley)
* [[Swamp Thing]] (Alec Holland)
* [[Tefé Holland|The Sprout]] (Tefé Holland)
* [[Alan Scott]] (Earth 2)

[[Floronic Man]] went insane after attempting to connect with the Green through Swamp Thing.

{{refimprove|article|date=January 2018}}
'''Property dualism''' describes a category of positions in the [[philosophy of mind]] which hold that, although the world is composed of just one kind of [[substance theory|substance]]—[[Materialism|the physical kind]]—there exist two distinct kinds of properties: [[physical properties]] and [[mental properties]]. In other words, it is the view that non-physical, mental properties (such as beliefs, desires and emotions) inhere in or [[Supervenience|supervene]] upon certain physical substances (namely [[Human Brain|brains]]). 

[[dualism (philosophy of mind)|Substance dualism]], on the other hand, is the view that there exist in the universe two fundamentally different kinds of substance: physical ([[matter]]) and non-physical ([[mind]] or [[consciousness]]), and subsequently also two kinds of properties which adhere in those respective substances. Substance dualism thus has a much harder time with the [[mind-body problem]]. Both substance and property dualism are opposed to [[reductive physicalism]].

==Emergent materialism==
{{main|Emergent materialism}}

[[Emergentism]] is the idea that increasingly complex structures in the world give rise to the "emergence" of new properties that are something over and above (i.e. cannot be reduced to) their more basic constituents. The concept of [[emergence]] dates back to the late 19th century. [[John Stuart Mill]] notably argued for an emergentist conception of science in his 1843 ''System of Logic''.

Applied to the mind/body relation, [[emergent materialism]] is another way of describing the non-reductive physicalist conception of the mind that asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way (i.e., organized in the way that living human bodies are organized), [[mental properties]] emerge.

==Non-reductive physicalism==
{{Main|Physicalism#Non-reductive_physicalism|l1=Non-reductive physicalism}}

Non-reductive physicalism is the predominant contemporary form of property dualism according to which mental properties are mapped to [[neurobiological]] properties, but are not [[reduction (philosophy)|reducible]] to them. Non-reductive physicalism asserts that mind is not ontologically reducible to matter, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. It asserts that while mental states are physical in that they are caused by physical states, they are not ontologically reducible to physical states. No mental state is the same one thing as some physical state, nor is any mental state composed merely from physical states and phenomena. 

===Anomalous monism===
{{main|Anomalous monism}}

Most contemporary non-reductive physicalists subscribe to a position called [[anomalous monism]] (or something very similar to it). Unlike epiphenomenalism, which renders mental properties causally redundant, anomalous monists believe that mental properties make a causal difference to the world. The position was originally put forward by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] in his 1970 paper ''Mental Events'', which stakes an identity claim between mental and physical tokens based on the notion of supervenience.

=== Biological naturalism===
{{main|Biological naturalism}}
[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|right|Biological Naturalism states that [[consciousness]] is a higher level function of the [[human brain]]'s physical capabilities.]]
Another argument for non-reductive physicalism has been expressed by [[John Searle]], who is the advocate of a distinctive form of physicalism he calls biological naturalism. His view is that although mental states are not [[ontology|ontologically]] reducible to physical states, they are causally reducible (see [[causality]]). He believes the mental will ultimately be explained through neuroscience. This worldview does not necessarily fall under ''property dualism'', and therefore does not necessarily make him a "property dualist". He has acknowledged that "to many people" his views and those of property dualists look a lot alike. But he thinks the comparison is misleading.&lt;ref&gt;Searle, John (1983) "Why I Am Not a Property Dualist", {{cite web |url=http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210160023/http://ist-socrates.berkeley.edu/~jsearle/132/PropertydualismFNL.doc |archivedate=2006-12-10 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epiphenomenalism ==
{{main|Epiphenomenalism}}

[[Epiphenomenalism]] is a doctrine about mental-physical causal relations which holds that one or more mental states and their properties are the by-products (or [[epiphenomena]]) of the states of a closed physical system, and are not causally reducible to physical states (do not have any influence on physical states). According to this view mental properties are as such real constituents of the world, but they are causally impotent; while physical causes give rise to mental properties like [[wikt:sensation|sensation]]s, [[volition (psychology)|volition]], [[idea]]s, etc., such mental phenomena themselves cause nothing further - they are causal dead ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harnvb|Churchland|1984|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turner - Rain, Steam and Speed - National Gallery file.jpg|thumb|Huxley explained mental properties as like the steam on a locomotive]]
The position is credited to English biologist [[Thomas Huxley]] (Huxley 1874), who analogised mental properties to the whistle on a steam locomotive. The position found favour amongst scientific [[behaviourists]] over the next few decades, until [[behaviourism]] itself fell to the [[cognitive revolution]] in the 1960s. Recently, epiphenomenalism has gained popularity with those struggling to reconcile non-reductive physicalism and [[mental causation]].
===Epiphenomenal qualia===
In the paper ''Epiphenomenal Qualia'' and later ''What Mary Didn't Know'' [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] made the so-called [[knowledge argument]] against physicalism. The [[thought experiment]] was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows:

{{Quotation|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the [[neurophysiology]] of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like 'red', 'blue', and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the [[central nervous system]] the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence 'The sky is blue'. [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a [[color television]] monitor? Will she learn anything or not?&lt;ref name="p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|1982|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Panpsychist property dualism==
{{Main|Panpsychism}}

Panpsychism is the view that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of experience or point of view. Superficially, it seems to be a form of property dualism, since
it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say that mechanical behaviour is derived from the primitive mentality of atoms and molecules &amp;mdash; as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of [[complexity|complex]] structure in a compound object. So long as the ''reduction'' of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not strictly a form of property dualism; otherwise it is. 
===Thomas Nagel===
[[Thomas Nagel]] posed the question [[What is it like to be a bat?]] [[Daniel Dennett]], a critic of Nagel's argument, nevertheless called this paper "the most widely cited and influential thought experiment about consciousness."&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dennett|first1=Daniel C.|title=[[Consciousness Explained]]|date=1991|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|location=Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|441}}

{{Quotation|If physicalism is to be defended, the phenomenological features must themselves be given a physical account. But when we examine their subjective character it seems that such a result is impossible. The reason is that every subjective phenomenon is essentially connected with a single point of view and it seems inevitable that an objective, physical theory will abandon that point of view.}}

===David Chalmers===
In more recent work, [[David Chalmers]] has revisited his formerly negative views concerning [[Quantum mind|quantum-theories of consciousness]], and expressed sympathy towards the idea that consciousness be identified with the [[Wave function collapse|collapse of the wave-function]].

===Saul Kripke===
Kripke has a well-known argument for some kind of property dualism. Using the concept of [[rigid designator]]s, he states that if dualism is logically possible, then it is the case.
{{Quotation|Let 'Descartes' be a name, or rigid designator, of a certain person, and let 'B' be a rigid designator of his body. Then if Descartes were indeed identical to B, the supposed identity, being an identity between two rigid designators, would be necessary.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8426">'''Quality function deployment''' ('''QFD''') is a method developed in Japan beginning in 1966 to help transform the [[voice of the customer]] into [[engineering]] characteristics for a product.&lt;ref name="Customer Driven"&gt;{{cite book |last= Akao |first= Yoji|title= The Customer Driven Approach to Quality Planning and Deployment |year=1994|publisher= Asian Productivity Organization |location=Minato, Tokyo |isbn= 92-833-1121-3 |chapter=Development History of Quality Function Deployment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p117"&gt;Larson et al. (2009). p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoji Akao]], the original developer, described QFD as a "method to transform qualitative user demands into quantitative parameters, to deploy the functions forming quality, and to deploy methods for achieving the design quality into subsystems and component parts, and ultimately to specific elements of the manufacturing process."&lt;ref name="Customer Driven"/&gt; The author combined his work in [[quality assurance]] and [[quality control]] points with function deployment used in [[value engineering]].

== House of quality ==
&lt;!--

Larson is speaking as if the house of quality is QFD, which is denied by the original developer Akao, who believes it to be a part of QFD. This distinction seems to be lost in much of the English literature, just from a brief review. Feel free to discuss on the talk page about how to approach this problem.

--&gt;
[[File:A1 House of Quality.png|thumb|250px|right|A house of quality for enterprise product development processes]]
The house of quality, a part of QFD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.qfdi.org/what_is_qfd/faqs_about_qfd.htm#What%20is%20the%20House%20of%20Quality%20Why%20it%20isnt%20a%20QFD |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044623/http://www.qfdi.org/what_is_qfd/faqs_about_qfd.htm |archivedate=December 13, 2013 |deadurl=yes |title=Frequently Asked Questions about QFD |work=QFDI.org |publisher=QFD Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the basic design tool of quality function deployment.&lt;ref name="hbr 1988" /&gt;  It identifies and classifies customer desires, identifies the importance of those desires, identifies engineering characteristics which may be relevant to those desires, correlates the two, allows for verification of those correlations, and then assigns objectives and priorities for the system requirements.&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p117"/&gt; This process can be applied at any system composition level (e.g. system, subsystem, or component) in the design of a product, and can allow for assessment of different abstractions of a system.&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p117"/&gt; The house of quality appeared in 1972 in the design of an oil tanker by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]].&lt;ref name="hbr 1988"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://hbr.org/1988/05/the-house-of-quality |work=Harvard Business Review |title=The House of Quality |first1=John R. |last1=Hauser |first2=Don |last2=Clausing |issue=May 1988 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416131507/https://hbr.org/1988/05/the-house-of-quality |archivedate=April 16, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Trying (badly?) to balance process description with [[WP:NOTHOWTO]]. --&gt;
The output of the house of quality is generally a matrix with customer desires on one dimension and correlated [[nonfunctional requirement]]s on the other dimension.&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p119"&gt;Larson et al. (2009). p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The cells of matrix table are filled with the weights assigned to the stakeholder characteristics where those characteristics are affected by the system parameters across the top of the matrix.&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p119"/&gt; At the bottom of the matrix, the column is summed, which allows for the system characteristics to be weighted according to the stakeholder characteristics.&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p119"/&gt; System parameters not correlated to stakeholder characteristics may be unnecessary to the system design and are identified by empty matrix columns, while stakeholder characteristics (identified by empty rows) not correlated to system parameters indicate "characteristics not addressed by the design parameters".&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p119"/&gt; System parameters and stakeholder characteristics with weak correlations potentially indicate missing information, while matrices with "too many correlations" indicate that the stakeholder needs may need to be [[:wikt:refined|refined]].&lt;ref name="Larson 2009 p119"/&gt;

== Areas of application ==
QFD is applied in a wide variety of services, consumer products, and military needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.di.ufpe.br/~req_case/Seminarios/Prioridades/qfd.pdf |title=Quality Function Deployment (Draft) |website=di.ufpe.br |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232457/http://www.di.ufpe.br/~req_case/Seminarios/Prioridades/qfd.pdf |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuzziness ==
The concepts of [[fuzzy logic]] have been applied to QFD ("Fuzzy QFD" or "FQFD").&lt;ref name="industrial QFD 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2013/682532 |title=Fuzzy Quality Function Deployment: An Analytical Literature Review |journal=Journal of Industrial Engineering |date=2013 |first1=Mohammad |last1=Abdolshah |first2=Mohsen |last2=Moradi}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of 70 papers in 2013 by Abdolshah and Moradi found a number of conclusions: most FQFD "studies were focused on quantitative methods" to construct a house of quality matrix based on customer requirements, where the most-employed techniques were based on [[multiple-criteria decision analysis]] methods.&lt;ref name="industrial QFD 2013"/&gt; They noted that there are factors other than the house of quality relevant to product development, and called [[metaheuristic]] methods "a promising approach for solving complicated problems of FQFD."&lt;ref name="industrial QFD 2013"/&gt;

== Derived techniques and tools ==
[[Pugh concept selection]] can be used in coordination with QFD to select a promising product or service configuration from among listed alternatives.

[[Modular function deployment]] uses QFD to establish customer requirements and to identify important design requirements with a special emphasis on modularity. There are three main differences to QFD as applied in modular function deployment compared to house of quality:&lt;ref name="MFD-QFD"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Börjesson |first1=Fredrik |last2=Jiran |first2=Scott |title=The Generation of Modular Product Architecture Deploys a Pragmatic Version of Quality Function Deployment |url=http://modularmanagement.com/en/articles/modular-function-deploymentr-concepts-qfd |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231214332/http://modularmanagement.com/en/articles/modular-function-deploymentr-concepts-qfd |archivedate=December 31, 2012 |registration=yes |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The benchmarking data is mostly gone; the checkboxes and crosses have been replaced with circles, and the triangular "roof" is missing.&lt;ref name="MFD-QFD" /&gt;

'''Raed al Atar''' (1974–2014) was the commander of the [[Rafah]] company of the [[Hamas]] [[Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades]] and member of the Hamas high military council. According to the [[Congressional Research Service]] analyst Jim Zanotti, his command was important due to Rafah being the destination point for the [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels|smuggling tunnels from Egypt]].&lt;ref name="CRS1"/&gt;

In 2010, al Atar reportedly held significant power and influence in the Gaza Strip, and asserted authority over the smuggling tunnels.&lt;ref name="Pfeffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xinhua"&gt;"Hamas threats to kidnap more Israeli soldiers". Xinhua, 28 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the third most senior Hamas military commander, according to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/two-hamas-commanders-killed-in-israeli-air-strike-in-gaza-1.1904190 "Two Hamas commanders killed in Israeli air strike in Gaza"] by Mark Weiss, in Jerusalem, 22 August 2014, irishtimes.com; accessed 27 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1995, al Atar was sentenced, following a quick trial by the [[Palestinian Authority]] court, to two years in jail for training with illegal weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/03/world/palestinians-hold-quick-secret-trials.html Palestinians Hold Quick, Secret Trials"], ''New York Times''; 3 May 1995; accessed 22 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Palestinian Authority alleged to run secret 'trials' lasting just a few minutes", ''The Baltimore Sun'', 4 May 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 1999 a Palestinian police captain, Rifat Joudah, was killed in Gaza a shootout with al Atar and two other members of Hamas, as he was trying to arrest them. The men sped away, running over an 8-year-old girl, Fadwa Abu Jerwana, who died from her injuries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/ORIENTE_PROXIMO/PALESTINA/HAMAS_/PALESTINA/ACUERDO_DE_WYE_PLANTATION_/OCTUBRE_1998/policia/palestino/nina/mueren/tiroteo/militantes/Hamas/elpepiint/19990202elpepiint_19/Tes "Un policía palestino y una niña mueren en un tiroteo con militantes de Hamás"], ''El Pais'', 2 February 1999. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men were subsequently arrested in the [[Al-Shati (camp)|Shati refugee camp]] following a second exchange of fire with security forces. In April that year, al Atar was sentenced to death by the Palestinian Authority for the killing of Rifat Joudah. As soon as the death sentence was pronounced, al Atar's relatives took to the streets and stoned the Joudeh home.&lt;ref&gt;"Death penalty fallout challenges Arafat", ''Laredo Morning Times'', 15 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Violent protests in Gaza resulted in two deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Joel Greenberg, [http://articles.sfgate.com/1999-03-11/news/17680734_1_palestinian-security-palestinian-court-palestinian-authority "Two Killed in Riots In Gaza Over Death Sentence/Palestinian court ruling causes demonstrations"], ''New York Times'', 11 March 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barzak, Ibrahim.

In 2006, al Atar directed the [[2006 Gaza cross-border raid|cross-border raid]] in which Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]] was captured. He was also present during Shalit's release from captivity during the [[Gilad Shalit prisoner exchange|2011 prisoner exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2014/08/israeli-strikes-hit-3-top-hamas-leaders.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/gilad-shalit-and-hamas-commander-raed-al-attar/&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2009 [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]], al Atar fled to [[Arish|el-Arīsh, Sinai]], along with Mohammed Sanwar, a militant who had helped coordinate the abduction of an Israeli soldier, [[Gilad Shalit]].&lt;ref&gt;Amos Harel.

'''Respiratory arrest''' is caused by [[apnea]] (cessation of [[breathing]]) or respiratory dysfunction severe enough it will not sustain the body (such as [[Agonal respiration|agonal breathing]]).  Prolonged apnea refers to a patient who has stopped breathing for a long period of time. If the [[heart muscle]] contraction is intact, the condition is known as respiratory arrest. An abrupt stop of pulmonary [[gas exchange]] lasting for more than five minutes may damage vital organs especially the [[brain]], possibly permanently. Lack of [[oxygen]] to the brain causes loss of [[consciousness]]. Brain injury is likely if respiratory arrest goes untreated for more than three minutes, and [[death]] is almost certain if more than five minutes.

Damage may be reversible if treated early enough. Respiratory arrest is a life-threatening [[medical emergency]] that requires immediate medical attention and management. To save a patient suffering from respiratory arrest, the goal is to restore adequate ventilation and prevent further damage. Management interventions include supplying oxygen, opening the [[airway]], and means of [[artificial ventilation]]. In some instances, an impending respiratory arrest could be predetermined by signs the patient is showing, such as the increased work of breathing. Respiratory arrest will ensue once the patient depletes their oxygen reserves and loses the effort to breathe. 

Respiratory arrest can be used interchangeably with complete respiratory failure. The former refers to the complete cessation of breathing, while [[respiratory failure]] is the inability to provide adequate ventilation for the body’s requirements. However, both lead to death without intervention. Respiratory arrest is also different from [[cardiac arrest]], the failure of heart muscle contraction. If untreated, one may lead to the other.

==Causes==
* [[Airway obstruction]]: Obstruction may occur in the upper and lower airway. Upper airway obstruction is common in infants less than 3 months old, because they are nose breathers. Nasal blockage may easily lead to upper airway obstruction in infants. For other ages, upper airway obstruction may occur from [[edema]] of the [[vocal cords]], foreign bodies, or pharyngolaryngeal tracheal inflammation. Lower airway obstruction may occur from bronchospasm, drowning, or airspace filling disorders (e.g. pneumonia, pulmonary edema, pulmonary hemorrhage).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rf/causes.html National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.] "What Causes Respiratory Failure?"&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decreased respiratory effort: Central nervous system impairment leads to decreased respiratory effort. Central nervous system disorders, such as [[stroke]] and tumors, may cause hypoventilation. Drugs may decrease respiratory effort as well, such as opioids, sedative-hypnotics, and alcohol. An overdose of any of these drugs may lead to a decreased respiratory effort. Metabolic disorders could also decrease respiratory effort. Hypoglycemia and hypotension depress the central nervous system and compromise the respiratory system.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler MB, Bohn D, Cox BN, McCrindle BW, Jarvis A, Edmonds J, Barker G. Outcome of out-of-hospital cardiac or respiratory arrest in children. New England Journal of Medicine. 1996; 335:1473-1479. [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199611143352001#t=abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Respiratory muscle weakness: Neuromuscular disorders may lead to respiratory muscle weakness, such as [[spinal cord]] injury, neuromuscular diseases, and neuromuscular blocking drugs. Respiratory muscle fatigue can also lead to respiratory muscle weakness if patients breathe over 70% of their maximum voluntary ventilation. Breathing over an extended period of time near maximum capacity can cause metabolic acidosis or [[hypoxemia]], ultimately leading to [[Muscles of respiration|respiratory muscle]] weakness.&lt;ref&gt;Merck Manual: Overview of respiratory arrest; 2016. [updated 2016; cited 25 March 2016]. Available from: http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/critical-care-medicine/respiratory-arrest/overview-of-respiratory-arrest.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms and signs==
One common symptom of respiratory arrest is [[cyanosis]], a bluish discoloration of the skin resulting from an inadequate amount of oxygen in the blood. If respiratory arrest remains without any treatment, cardiac arrest will occur within minutes of hypoxemia, [[hypercapnia]] or both. At this point, patients will be unconscious or about to become unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Fish DR, Howard RS, Wiles CM, Simon L. Respiratory arrest: a complication of cerebellar ectopia in adults. Journal of Neurology. 1988; 51: 714-716.  [http://jnnp.bmj.com/content/51/5/714.full.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

A condition that frequently precedes respiratory arrest is [[respiratory distress]], which is a gradual, subtle imbalance in patient response that can result in eventual respiratory failure and arrest. Symptoms of [[respiratory compromise]] can differ with each patient. Complications from [[respiratory compromise]] are increasing rapidly across the clinical spectrum, partly due to expanded use of opioids combined with the lack of standardized guidelines among medical specialties. While respiratory compromise creates problems that are often serious and potentially life-threatening, they are almost always preventable with the proper tools and approach. Appropriate patient monitoring and therapeutic strategies are necessary for early recognition, intervention and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall PS. Examples of Respiratory
Compromise. Pulmonary, Critical	Care &amp; Sleep Section, Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine. 2015. [http://www.respiratorycompromise.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Examples-of-Respiratory-Compromise.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impending respiratory arrest===
Before respiratory arrest officially occurs, patients may experience some neurologic dysfunctions, such as feeling agitated, confused, and struggling to breathe. [[Tachycardia]], sweating, intercostal retractions, and sternoclavicular retractions may occur as well. Patients who have an impaired central nervous system or respiratory muscle weakness may experience irregular patterns of respiration and feeble, gasping attempts to breathe. Patients who developed respiratory arrest from the cause of a foreign body in the airway may choke, call the attention of people nearby to their neck, and give out a harsh sound. By monitoring a patient’s oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, practitioners can prepare for ensuing respiratory arrests in patients. Infants that are under three months may develop respiratory arrest without any signs of warning and must be carefully taken care of. The development of respiratory arrest could come from infection, metabolism disorders, or respiratory fatigue. Another group of patients that should be on the watch list are asthmatics or patients with other chronic lung diseases. They can be become [[hypercapnia|hypercapnic]] or tired after bouts of respiratory distress. These symptoms will lead to apnea without any signs of warning.&lt;ref&gt;Leape LL, Holder TM, Franklin JD, Amoury RA, Ashcraft KW. Respiratory arrest in infants secondary to gastroesophageal reflux. Pediatrics. 1977; 60(6). [http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/60/6/924]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis requires clinical evaluation. If there was a foreign body obstructing the airway, the first option would be to locate the foreign body. The presence of a foreign body can be detected from resistance to ventilation from the mouth-to-mask or bag-valve-mask ventilation. The foreign body can be extracted during [[laryngoscopy]] for endotracheal intubation.&lt;ref&gt;Donoghue AJ, Berg RA, Nadkarni V. Pediatric resuscitation. In: Marx JA, Hockberger RS, Walls RM, et al., eds. Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice. 8th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Saunders; 2014:chap 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clearing and opening the upper airway===

The first step to diagnosing patient is to clear and open the upper airway with correct head and neck positioning to determine the cause of respiratory arrest. The practitioner must lengthen and elevate the patient’s neck until the [[external auditory meatus]] is in the same plane as the sternum. The face should be facing the ceiling. The mandible should be positioned upwards by lifting the lower jaw and pushing the mandible upward. If a foreign body can be detected, the practitioner may remove it with a finger sweep of the oropharynx and suction. It is important that the practitioner does not cause the foreign body to be lodged even deeper into the patient’s body. Foreign bodies that are deeper into the patient’s body can be removed with Magill forceps or by suction. A Heimlick maneuver can also be used to dislodge the foreign body. The Heimlick maneuver consists of manual thrusts to the upper abdomen until the airway is clear. In conscious adults, the practitioner will stand behind the patient with arms around the patient’s midsection. One fist will be in a clenched formation while the other hand grabs the fist. Together, both hands will thrust inward and upward by pulling up with both arms.&lt;ref&gt;Ward KR, Kurz MC, Neumar RW. Adult resuscitation. In: Marx JA, Hockberger RS, Walls RM, et al., eds. Rosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice. 8th ed. Philadelphia, PA: Elsevier Saunders; 2014:chap 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bag-valve-mask (BVM) ventilation devices===

Resistance to [[bag valve mask]] may suggest presence of a foreign body that is obstructing airways and commonly used as a diagnostic tool and treatment for respiratory arrest. The bag-valve-mask device has a self-inflating bag with a soft mask that rests on the face. When the bag is connected to an oxygen supply, the patient will receive 60 to 100% of inspired oxygen. The purpose of bag-valve-mask is to provide adequate temporary ventilation and allow the body to achieve airway control by itself. However, if the bag-valve-mask is left on for more than five minutes, air may be introduced into the stomach. At that point, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to take the accumulated air out. During this process, practitioners must carefully position and maneuver the bag-valve-mask in order to keep airways open. An oropharyngeal airway is used during bag-valve-mask ventilation to prevent oropharynx soft tissues from blocking the airway. An oropharyngeal airway may cause gagging and vomiting. Therefore, an oropharyngeal airway must be sized appropriately. It should be as long as distance between corner of patient’s mouth and angle of the jaw is calculated correctly. For children, pediatric bags can be used. Pediatric bags have a valve that limits peak airway pressures to around 35–40&amp;nbsp;cm of water. Practitioners must tweak valve settings to accurately determine each of their patients to avoid hypoventilation or hyperventilation.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, J. L. (2015, January 25).

==Treatment==
Treatment involves clearing the airway, establishing an alternate airway, and providing [[artificial ventilation]] that can include [[modes of mechanical ventilation|modes]] of [[mechanical ventilation]]. There are many ways to provide an airway and to deliver breathing support. The list below includes several options.  

{{Expand list|date=August 2016}}

===Laryngeal mask airways (LMA)===

The [[laryngeal mask airway]] is a tube with an inflatable cuff. A laryngeal mask airway can be positioned in the lower oropharynx to prevent airway obstruction by soft tissues and to create a safe channel for ventilation. The laryngeal mask airway is the standard rescue ventilation when endotracheal intubation cannot be accomplished. To insert the laryngeal mask airway into the patient, the deflated mask should be pressed against the hard palate, rotated past the base of the tongue, and reaching the pharynx. Once the mask has been placed in the correct position, the mask can be inflated. Some benefits of the laryngeal mask airway include minimization of gastric inflation and protection against regurgitation. A potential problem the laryngeal mask airway poses is that over inflation will make the mask more rigid and less able to adapt to the patient’s anatomy, compressing the tongue and causing tongue edema. In that case, the mask pressure should be lowered or a larger mask size should be used. If non-comatose patients are given muscle relaxants before the insertion of the laryngeal mask airway, they may gag and aspirate when the drugs are worn off. At that point, the laryngeal mask airway should be removed immediately to eliminate the gag response and buy time to start at new alternative intubation technique.

===Endotracheal intubation===

A [[tracheal tube]] is inserted into the trachea through the mouth or nose. Endotracheal tubes contain high-volume, low-pressure balloon cuffs to minimize air leakage and the risk of aspiration. Cuffed tubes were made originally for adults and children over 8 years old, but cuffed tubes have been used in infants and younger children to prevent air leakage. Cuffed tubes can be inflated to the extent needed to prevent air leakage. The endotracheal tube is a guaranteed mechanism to secure a compromised airway, limit aspiration, and bring about mechanical ventilation in comatose patients. The endotracheal tube is a great method for patients who are comatose, have an obstructed airway, or need mechanical ventilation. The endotracheal tube also allows suctioning of the lower respiratory tract. Drugs that can be inserted through the endotracheal tube during cardiac arrest are discouraged. Before intubation, patients need correct patient positioning and ventilation with 100% oxygen. The purpose of ventilation with 100% oxygen is to denitrogenate healthy patients and prolong the safe apneic time. Tubes with an internal diameter of over 8mm are acceptable for most adults. Insertion technique includes visualizing the epiglottis, the posterior laryngeal structure, and not passing the tube unless tracheal insertion is ensured.&lt;ref&gt;Respiratory arrest. (2015, August 13). Retrieved May 1, 2016, from http://www.rightdiagnosis.com/r/respiratory_arrest/intro.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical airway===

Surgical entry is required when the upper airway is obstructed by a foreign body, massive trauma has occurred, or if ventilation cannot be accomplished by any of the aforementioned methods. The requirement of the surgical airway is commonly known as the response to failed intubation. In comparison, surgical airways require 100 seconds to complete from incision to ventilation compared to laryngeal mask airways and other devices. During emergency [[cricothyrotomy]], the patient lies on his back with neck extended and shoulders backward. The larynx is held in one hand by the practitioner while the other hand is holding a blade to incise the skin through the subcutaneous tissue and into the midline of the cricothyroid membrane to access the trachea. A hollow tube is used inserted into the trachea to keep the airway open. A tracheal hook is used to keep the space open and prevent retraction. Complications may include hemorrhage, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumothorax. Cricothyrotomy is used as emergency surgical access due to being fast and simple. Another surgical airway method is called tracheostomy. Tracheostomy is done in the operating room by a surgeon. This is the preferred method for patients requiring long-term ventilation. Tracheostomy uses skin puncture and dilators to insert the tracheostomy tube.&lt;ref&gt;ACLS Secondary Survey for a Patient in Respiratory Arrest. (2016, May 6). Retrieved May 8, 2016, from https://www.acls.net/acls-secondary-survey.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs to aid intubation===

Patients with respiratory arrest can be intubated without drugs. However, patients can be given sedating and paralytic drugs to minimize discomfort and help out with intubation. Pretreatment includes 100% oxygen, lidocaine, and atropine. 100% oxygen should be administered for 3 to 5 minutes. The time depends on pulse rate, pulmonary function, RBC count, and other metabolic factors. [[Lidocaine]] can be given in 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg IV a few minutes before sedation and paralysis. The purpose of administering lidocaine is to blunt the sympathetic response of an increased heart rate, blood pressure, and intracranial pressure caused by laryngoscopy. Atropine can be given when children produce a vagal response, evidenced by bradycardia, in response to intubation. Some physicians even give out vecuronium, which is a neuromuscular blocker to prevent muscle fasciculations in patients over 4 years old. Fasciculations may result in muscle pain on awakening. Laryngoscopy and intubation are uncomfortable procedures, so etomidate may be delivered. Etomidate is a short-acting IV drug with sedative analgesic properties. The drug works well and does not cause cardiovascular depression.  Ketamine is an anesthetic that may be used as well, but it may cause hallucinations or bizarre behavior upon awakening. Thiopental and methohexital may be used as well to provide sedation, but they tend to cause hypotension.&lt;ref&gt;RESPIRATORY ARREST. (2016, January 1).

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Volume-cycled ventilation===

The purpose of mechanical ventilators is to deliver a constant volume, constant pressure, or a combination of both with each breath. Any given volume will correspond to a specific pressure on the pressure-volume curve and vice versa in any case. Settings on each mechanical ventilator may include respiratory rate, tidal volume, trigger sensitivity, flow rate, waveform, and inspiratory/expiratory ratio. The volume-cycled ventilation includes the volume-control function and delivers a set tidal volume. The pressure is not a fixed number but it varies with resistance and [[capacitance]]  of the respiratory system. The volume-cycled ventilation is the simplest and most efficient of providing ventilation to a patient’s airway compared to other methods of mechanical ventilation. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the set sensitivity threshold will be accounted for and fixed to the delivery of the corresponding tidal volume. If the patient does not breathe enough, then the volume-cycled ventilation will initiate a breath for the patient to bring up the breathing rate to the minimum respiratory rate. The synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) is a similar method of mechanical ventilation that also delivers breaths at a fixed rate and volume that corresponds to the patient’s breathing. Unlike the Volume-Cycled Ventilation, patient efforts above the fixed rate are unassisted in the synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV).&lt;ref&gt;Review of Respiratory Arrest. (2016, January 1). Retrieved May 8, 2016, from https://acls-algorithms.com/respiratory-arrest/
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pressure-cycled ventilation===

The pressure-cycled ventilation includes pressure control ventilation and pressure support ventilation. Both methods offer a set inspiratory pressure. The [[tidal volume]] varies depending on the resistance and elastance of the respiratory system. Pressure-cycled ventilation can help alleviate symptoms in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome by limiting the distending pressure of the lungs. The pressure control ventilation is specifically a pressure-cycled form of assist-control ventilators. Assist-control ventilators describe a mode of ventilation that maintains a minimum respiratory rate regardless of whether or not the patient initiates a spontaneous breath. Each inspiratory effort that is beyond the sensitivity threshold delivers full pressures support for a fixed inspiratory time. There is maintenance of a minimum respiratory rate. In the pressure support ventilation, the minimum rate is not set. Instead, all breaths are triggered by the patient. The way that the pressure support ventilation works is by assisting the patient with a constant pressure until the patient’s inspiratory flow fallows below a threshold. The longer, deeper inspiratory flows by the patient will result in a larger tidal volume. This method of mechanical ventilation will help patients assume more work of breathing.&lt;ref&gt;O'Rourke PP. Outcome of children who are apneic and pulseless in the emergency room. Crit Care Med 1986;14:466-468&lt;/ref&gt;

===Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV)===
Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is the delivery of positive pressure ventilation through a tight-fitting mask that covers the nose and mouth. It assists patients who can spontaneously breathe. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation delivers end-expiratory pressure with a volume control setting. There are two ways that noninvasive positive pressure ventilation can be delivered: continuous [[positive airway pressure]] or bilevel positive airway pressure. In continuous positive airway pressure, constant pressure is maintained throughout cycles of respiration with no additional inspiratory support. In bilevel positive airway pressure, both expiratory positive airway pressure and inspiratory positive airway pressure are set by the physician. Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation should not be administered to people who are hemodynamically unstable, gastric emptying impaired, bowel obstructed or pregnant. In these circumstances, swallowing large amounts of air will result in vomiting and possibly death.  If frequent arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and shock arrhythmias occur, practitioners should change delivery to endotracheal intubation or conventional mechanical ventilation. People who should not use noninvasive positive pressure ventilation include obtunded patients or ones with secretions. Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation can be used in an outpatient setting for patients with obstructive sleep apnea.&lt;ref&gt;O'Marcaigh AS, Koenig WJ, Rosekrans JA, Berseth CL.

'''''Robotix''''' is a 1985 [[animated series]] based on the [[Milton Bradley Company|Milton Bradley]] toy of the [[Robotix (toyline)|same name]]. The original toy was of the construction type, similar to the [[Erector Set]] and [[K'Nex]], that included [[electric motor|motor]]s, [[wheel]]s, and [[pincers (tool)|pincers]]. The series follows the conflict between the peaceful Protectons and the warmongering Terrakors on the alien world of Skalorr, and a group of humans who get caught up in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sinister Tarheel|title=robotix intro/outro|date=2015-07-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5NxVF7oErs|accessdate=2017-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]] and [[Marvel Productions]], and was animated in [[Japan]] by [[Toei Animation]], which also animated other cartoons featured on ''[[Super Sunday (TV series)|Super Sunday]]''. It features background music also used for Transformers and though a kids cartoon it does have considerable violence even to humans.

==Characters==

===Protectons===
*'''Argus''': Leader of the Protectons. Before his transfer into a Robotix body known as the '''R-2000'''. He was the chief-in-command of Protecton Capital, Zanadon, and had a romantic relationship with Narra. He is compassionate and brave, and tries to help the humans. He despises killing to the point that he'd rather hurt himself than allow anybody to use him to kill another being. He almost suffered a nervous breakdown upon discovering that his mind and life force were downloaded into a robot shell. He has a humanoid robot form with a head on a long neck and a curved blade for a right hand. Memorable transformations and features include a car-like form, a hand blade changing into a gun, laser cannons deploying from his chest, a head usable as a ramrod, and a compact mode with shrunken arms and legs. Pilot of choice: Exeter Galaxon
*'''Bront''': The tough guy of the team, as he is the strongest of the Protectons. Before his transfer to the body called the '''R-1500''' he maintained Zanadon's command center and initiated its battle mode. He's close friends with Jerrok, who often teased him in the past because of his meager size. Their trust was strained when Bront was wrongly accused of sabotaging Zanadon's reactor and almost attacked Kontor and Jerrok, but their partnership was soon reestablished. His Robotix form has a humanoid body from the waist up, and his four legs have wheels as feet. Memorable transformations and features include a car-like form with deployable grabber, an extreme extension of his torso to form a ladder, extendable legs for river crossing, a deployable twin laser cannon of his forehead, and hands combining into a drill-like form. Pilot of choice: Tauron
*'''Jerrok''': A friend of Bront, he helped him activate Zanadon's battle mode. He used to tease Bront as he was twice as tall as him, but during the transfer he acquired the smallest Robotix unit. His robot form consists of a humanoid torso, with arms and head attached to a giant wheel having two smaller wheels on the sides. Having the fastest and most maneuverable body, he likes to play with his opponents while fighting them. Memorable transformations and features include hands with built-in laser cannons and an extreme extension of his arms. Pilot of choice: Spiro
*'''Narra''': The only female Robotix character in the series. Before being transferred into a Robotix body by '''Compucore''', the Protecton computer, she was Argus' assistant, and shared a romantic relationship with him. She is caring, and wants to help humans as she understands how fragile they are compared to their own robot forms. She is also very bright, being the first Protecton to see through Venturak's masquerade. Her Robotix unit is a small dome with a face, mounted on four powerful legs that are also usable as hands. Her body is significantly durable, and it can remain fully operational and mobile even when some of her legs are severely damaged or even removed. Memorable transformations and features include a hover-jet mode, an ability to hover and slide above ground, crane/grabbers deployable from her legs, and laser cannons deployable from her feet. Pilot of choice: Steff
*'''Boltar''': The gentle beast of the Protectons. Boltar is kind and supportive to his allies, yet can be a serious threat to his enemies. On one occasion he was even able to take out four Terrakors, all on his own. He may be slightly mentally undeveloped, as he always speaks of himself in the third person and uses simple, short sentences (much like the Dinobots from Transformers). His Robotix body has a bulky, bear-like torso on six thin legs. It is the second Robotix unit created during the movie, and was assembled and animated by Zarru and Compucore during their stay in Zanadon, when they found an unfinished and part-lacking Robotix in one of the hangars. Apparently, the body Boltar uses was still under construction when Skalorr's sun went supernova and was abandoned by its creators. Memorable transformations and features include a humanoid combat form, a helicopter mode, and multiple onboard weapon systems, including laser cannons and flamethrowers. Boltar didn't choose his pilot - during his first battle he was piloted by Zarru, but later Exeter assigns Flexor as his partner, without any objection from the Protecton himself.
*'''Kontor''': Before the supernova cataclysm, Kontor was known as Zanadon's main architect, and the designer whom Argus found trustworthy. He had a very short appearance, as he was ambushed by Nemesis and Tyranix in the Capsule Chamber just after he was transferred into his robotic body, and was sent back into Compucore's essence bank to be replaced by Venturak. His Robotix form was built by Protectons from spare parts found in the Capsule Chamber, and resembles a bear/canine with shovel-like feet. He never had any pilot, nor a chance to use any of his body features.

===Terrakors===
*'''Nemesis''': Ruthless ruler of the Terrakors, who tries to take over Skalorr. In one of the flashbacks he is seen trying to attack Zanadon with his army, but fails, swearing death to deserters and vengeance to Argus. When it was discovered that the sun will go nova he opted for manning the Terrastarr and abandoning the dying planet, and even after transferring into his Robotix body he is willing to execute the plan. He has an obsession with obtaining the Compucore and using it to control Terrastarr, which he admires and treats with great care (as seen when Goon fails in salvaging the ship from a lake, being almost torn apart by a furious Nemesis). Unlike Argus, Nemesis sees his new body as a better chance to flee from the planet and conquer space, which helps him use his Robotix form more efficiently. He trusts only Tyrannix, even if he's not always willing to show it - or even throws him away. His robot form was of a blue humanoid with a lizard-like head. Memorable transformations and features included a left hand capable of extreme extension (First meeting with Kanawk he keeps poking him with 'that thing' and for Kanawk's insolence drops him from great height only to catch him at the last moment with the said extension) and shifting into a laser gun, buzz saw, super-sharp beam whips built into hands, and small threads built into feet for high speed rolling functions. Pilot of choice: Kanawk.
*'''Tyrannix''': A cold and calculating second-in-command of the Terrakors, who was transferred to the body identified as the '''R-1100'''. He has the most firepower and is also their communications expert. He is mostly loyal to Nemesis, although he overthrows him when he tires of Nemesis' failed attempts to find the Terrastarr. There is no record of him before his awakening as a mind-possessed Robotix body specialized for communications and mid-range combat. He has highly sensitive sensor systems, being able to detect targets approaching from miles away and even accurately telling who exactly the target is. His Robotix body is a skeletal humanoid with wing-like radar panels and plasma engines as his legs and left arm. As such, he never walks on the ground, preferring to hover and fly - although he can use the engines as normal legs if he wants to, as shown when he is running in the air when his leg engines are on. His arm engine also doubles as a flamethrower, laser cannon and a correction thruster while in zero gravity. Often singles out Narra in combat. Pilot of choice: Gaxon. Fitting choice as Gaxon is just as merciless and cunning (He suggests stealing the last rations from Exeter's crew with considerable cruel delight and also later tries to force Argus to destroy a rock creature when briefly pilotting him)
*'''Steggor''': A cunning serpentine Terrorkor. Has a rivalry with Bront. His relationship with his pilot is the least cordial of all the Robotix. Pilot of choice: Nommo.
*'''Goon''': A dim-witted grunt Terrorkor that possesses little intelligence. Shaped like a tank with two arms. Robust build and is even used as the head of a battering ram by the Robotix to escape the rock creatures. Pilot of choice: Lupus, who also doesn't get on too well with his Robotix.
*'''Venturak''': When attacking the stasis chamber, Nemesis and Tyrannix manage to subdue Kontor, replacing his mind with Venturak's mind, in the body named the '''R-1000''', who serves as the Terrorkor spy until he finally reveals his nature during the assault on Zanadon. Pilot of choice: Traxis.
*'''Terragar''': Briefly seen when Nemesis captures Argus and attempts to delete his personality, replacing it with a Terrakor to deceive the Protectons. Once discovered, Terragar's mind is returned into Compucore.

===Humans===
*Captain Exeter Galaxon: Textbook leader, is brave, compassionate, intelligent, resourceful and holds his own in the face of adversity, never more so in the climatic battle where in a spaceship devoid of oxygen he still is able to steer the Terrastar towards an asteroid for intended mutual destruction of friends and foe.
*Tauron: Logical and wise older crew member, it is he who states to his captain it's in their interests in assist the Protectons in their battle.
*Kanawk: Traitorous man who often is the naysayer with his captain, he splits the crew up to join the Terrakors in a bid to get off the planet with their ship. Though he brokers the alliance with the Terrakors he often gets on Nemesis' badside, almost being killed on their first meeting even.
*Gaxon: Ruthless, quiet officer who isn't above sadism. He suggests they steal what little food his former crew mates have on their ship, when they consume the ill gotten spoils and Nommo asks if they should save the double agent Traxis a portion, he says 'You gotta be kidding'. After his Robotix Tyrannix blasts Argus he is heard laughing, also when he briefly pilots Argus in their bid to escape the rock creatures he tries to kill them but Argus turns the gun on himself and ejects Gaxon as he only wants to escape, not to destroy.
*Lupus Kerr: Character that often whinges and speaks with sarcasm, poor fit to give him command of the dimmest Robotix. He even briefly walks out on his faction after nearly dying with Goon, when being used as a guinea pig to reactivate the Terrastar. (Lupus even tries to escape when they are setting up but Tyrannix stops him) 
*Nommo: Pessimistic and often at odds with his Robotix. He's not quite as mean or willing to fight as his group, example when they have the Protectons without interphase he is the only one who worries perhaps they aren't as helpless as they look and when Steggor is savouring the moment before harming Narra he scolds him 'Get on with it will you?!'
*Traxis: Double agent working for the Terrakors side, it's not clear why he openly turned down joining Kanawk but later accepts in secret saying, 'I was hoping you'd ask!' Only character in the show without an american accent.
*Steff: Medical officer, he conducts tests that shows Skalorr food is poisonous to humans but it's later revealed that applies only to their region. When Kanawk reveals his intention to leave the group and takes much of the group with him, Steff immediately says he'll divide the food though Exeter halts him saying, 'These traitors can eat dirt for all I care!'
*Flexor: He is the one present when the Terrakors rob the food rations from the human ship. He boldly tackles Tyrannix's hand with a saucepan and is legs are crushed by a refrigerator for his efforts. Appears to have had no lasting effects as he's fully mobile for the duration of the show. Probably afraid of big cats as he shows the most fear seeing the monstrous felid in the Rock creature volcano.
*Spiro: Portly crew member, he wrongly assures Flexor is not after their ship moments before Tyrannix steals their food.
*Zarru: Only sub adult human, at times a brash boy that gets into trouble. One point he goes off on his own to prove himself, when Flexor is chosen to be Boltar's pilot. He briefly manages to take over a disgraced Goon but Goon overthrows him, first time in the show we see the Robotix free will is stronger than what orders are issued from the pilot. (Argus would throw Gaxon out later in the show).

==Episode summaries==

===Battle of the Titans===
Pursued by a [[battle cruiser]], the [[starship]] of captain Exeter Galaxon crashes on the ruined planet of Skalorr and its occupants left for dead. However, the crew survives, only to immediately find themselves caught up in a battle between two factions of gigantic [[robot]] creatures - the Protectons and Terrakors - that emerge from the ground. While the Terrakors flee the scene, the Protectons befriend Galaxon and his crew, and help them rebuild their ship. During the repairs, Narra and Zarru discover that humans can interface with Robotix to enhance their abilities, while a renewed attack by the Terrakors forces Bront to put the new discovery to the test.

===Paradise Lost===
Interfaced with Galaxon, Bront uses his new abilities to rescue Argus, who, interfaced with Tauron, helps him fend the Terrakors off. In the ensuing brief moment of peace, Argus takes the humans to the Protectons’ underground base, where the history of Skalorr is related by Compucore, the planet's [[Artificial intelligence|central intelligence]]. Three million years prior, the organic, primate like race of the Protectons and [[Reptilian humanoid|lizard-like race]] Terrakors were forced to set aside their hostilities when their sun began to [[nova]]. While Nemesis planned to use Compucore to launch his ship, the Terrastarr, to transport a select few off the planet to safety, Compucore itself suggested the use of underground stasis tubes to preserve the entire population.

===Traitor In Our Midst===
The tale of Skalorr's history continues, as the entire population of the planet seal themselves in [[stasis (fiction)|stasis]] tubes. However, a [[radiation]] leak threatens their lives, and Compucore is forced to transfer and store their essences within itself. When the radiation levels finally subside to normal, millions of years later, Compucore transfers the essences of four Protectons and four Terrakors into the Robotix - giant machines created to rebuild Skalorr. The ensuing battle led into the current events.

As salvage and repair on the ship continues, Kanawk, Gaxon, Lupus and Nommo, dissatisfied with Galaxon's leadership, set out on their own to find the Terrastarr, and offer their services to the Terrakors.

===A Spy Is Born===
Nemesis accepts Kanawk's offer, and the renegade humans and Terrakors interface. Shortly after the Protectons complete the construction of a new Robotix, infused with the essence of Kontor, a Protecton, the Terrakors stage a diversion to lure the Protectons out of their base. With the battle raging outside, Nemesis and Tyrannix penetrate the base and replace Kontor's essence with that of Venturak, a Terrakor, who then interfaces with another [[turncoat]] human, Traxis, and is appointed as a [[spy]] within the Protecton ranks. He reveals to the Terrakors that the humans’ food supply is dwindling, resulting in an attack on their ship and the theft of their remaining rations.

===Crash Landing===
Repairs on the human ship continue apace, and success is finally achieved. However, the Terrakors attack the Protectons just as Galaxon's crew blasts off. Helpless before the interfaced Terrakors, the Protectons are facing certain doom until Galaxon's crew return to save them — only to discover that the Terrakors stole their [[guidance system]] when they took their food. The humans crash land onto the planet.

===Firestorm at the Oasis===
With their interfaces restored, the Protectons fend off the Terrakors, but Galaxon's ship is now beyond repair, and the humans are still without food. Compucore releases probes to locate consumable [[vegetation]], discovering an [[oasis]] that the humans and Protectons head for, while Argus and Venturak remain to guard Compucore. While the other Terrakors raze the oasis in an inferno, Nemesis invades the Protecton base with Venturak's help and captures Argus, erasing his essence.

===Captured===
The Protectons and humans at the oasis manage to survive by [[burrow]]ing their way out, but Argus's failure to respond to his radio hailing prompts Bront to return to the base to investigate. Meanwhile, Nemesis infuses Argus's body with the essence of another Terrakor, Terragar, and they escape with Compucore. Bront pursues them, but is almost tricked by Terragar, posing as Argus, with the deception only being revealed by Lupus’ presence at the controls. Bront seizes Compucore and flees into the [[crystalline]] Desert of Illusions, but, one by one, the illusions are dispelled, leaving Bront staring down Terragar's cannon barrel.

===The Lost Cities===
Narra and Jerrok come to Bront's aid, and the Terrakors flee, leaving Terragar's deactivated body behind. Compucore is able to restore Argus using a back-up copy of his essence, and the Protectons begin to search for their old city, Zanadon. At the same time, however, the Terrakors search for their own city, Terrakordia, and send Steggor to pursue the Protectons. The Terrakors then discover that it has been crushed by a [[glacier]], and that the Terrastarr is nowhere to be found. Enraged, Tyrannix turns on Nemesis and claims leadership of the Terrakors for himself, heading off with Goon to join Steggor.

Meanwhile, the Protectons seek to reactivate Zanadon, turning to Kontor, as he was responsible for creating the city. However, as his essence was replaced within the Robotix by Venturak, he sabotages the [[Turbocharger|turbo]] flow generator and pins the blame on Bront when the generator threatens to explode and destroy the entire city.

===Bront Stands Accused===
The Protectons only just manage to escape Zanadon as Compucore seals the city's dome to contain the explosion to only one of its multiple sectors. The situation is made worse by Venturak, who implicates Bront as a traitor, forcing the other Protectons to [[imprison]] him until his innocence can be proved. In the ensuing confusion, Tyrannix and Goon attempt to once again steal Compucore, but Venturak fights back, fearing Nemesis’ wrath. Nemesis and Steggor then re-enter the fray, and Zarru frees Bront, who convinces the other Protectons he is not a traitor by helping them claim victory in the battle.

Exploring inside Zanadon, Zarru discovers an incomplete Robotix body that requires additional parts. Venturak directs the Protectons to a nearby factory that contains the parts they need, but unbeknownst to them, the Terrakors have already set up an ambush there.

===The Factory of Death===
The Protectons struggle against the factory's various machines, while Zarru and Flexor put together the unfinished Robotix as best they can. A distress call from Argus forces them to activate the new Robotix, infusing it with the essence of Boltar, a Protecton, who stomps to the aid of the captive Protectons and rescues them. However, Galaxon refuses to leave Zarru in order to be Boltar's pilot, and, instead, appoints Flexor, and in an effort to prove to Galaxon that he is skilled enough, Zarru sets out to locate the Terrakors.

===Zarru Takes the Plunge===
Zarru crash lands somewhere in the icy [[tundra]] region of Skalorr, where the Terrakors have successfully located the Terrastarr submerged in a lake. As they attempt to reactivate the ship, the Protectons — running low on energy — set out searching for Zarru. Goon is given the unenviable job of launching the Terrastarr, and quickly loses control of the ship, burying it in an avalanche. Moving quickly, Zarru invades Goon's control capsule, but is thrown from it and rescued by the Protectons. The Terrakors are forced to flee due to their own depleting energy levels, and both factions head for Siliton Mountain to locate the crystals they need to recharge. However, the Terrakors have a head start, and stage a [[flash flood]] to wash the Protectons away.

===Attack of the Rock Creatures===
Boltar's bulk shields the Protectons from the flood, and they continue on their search for the crystals. However, both races are captured by a bizarre race of rock creatures, who also feed on the crystals. The creatures separate the humans from their Robotix partners, and imprison them in their [[wiktionary:subterranean|subterranean]] realm within a [[volcano]]. As the humans watch, they see the rock creatures smelt their ship (it is unexplained how the ship that was back at the Protectons ended up being where everyone was being held hostage), and it soon becomes apparent that the Robotix are to share the same fate, with Jerrok going first.

===All for One===
Held captive in a pit by the rock creatures, the humans are threatened by a monstrous many eyed [[felidae|feline]], which Galaxon uses to escape. Snatching a Siliton crystal, Galaxon recharges Jerrok, who saves himself and holds off the rock creatures while the humans recharge the other Robotix and interface with the nearest ones they can find. This leads to some unstable partnerships, as Argus ejects Gaxon from his cockpit for almost forcing him to kill a rock creature. Goon and Bront fuse into a battering ram that smashes open a path to freedom, but when Tyrannix opens fire on the rock creatures, he triggers the volcano, forcing all the Robotix and humans to partner up correctly to most efficiently save both themselves and the rock creatures from destruction. The rock creatures lead the Protectons to safety, but the Terrakors manage to survive on their own, and once again attack Zanadon, as Tyrannix buries the city in a [[rockslide]].

===Battle for Zanadon===
After brief concern from the Terrakors that the rockslide may have destroyed Compucore, Zanadon becomes airborne, and the Protectons try to move it out of reach. While Venturak and Compucore monitor city functions, the other Protectons explore various regions of the city. However, when Argus is attacked by Nemesis, he realises that “Kontor” has opened the city's dome to allow the Terrakors access. Tyrannix and Bront battle in the city's sporting stadium, while Steggor pursues Narra into the medical bay. Defeating Steggor, Narra discovers Venturak, the charade over, preparing to abscond with Compucore. No match for both Venturak and Tyrannix, Narra is defeated, and Nemesis and the Terrakors escape, with Compucore in their clutches. As the Protectons struggle to even close the city's domes without Compucore, the now-airborne Terrastarr soars overhead, and begins its attack.

===The Final Attack===
The Terrastarr razes Zanadon, but in the ensuing conflagration, the Protectons attempt to penetrate the Terrastarr's hull. Nemesis directs the ship into space, into a nearby asteroid belt, knocking all but Argus and Narra off into the void. They smash their way into the ship, and Narra is quickly knocked off into space by Tyrannix, leaving Argus and Galaxon alone to face the assembled Terrakors. Struggling against the airless vacuum, Galaxon directs the Terrastarr toward a giant asteroid, then grapples with Kanawk, as Argus overcomes the Terrakors and comes to his aid, hurling Kanawk aside into the wall (This apparent death of a human is shown onscreen) and escaping from the ship with Exeter and Compucore as it crashes into the [[asteroid]], exploding in a giant fireball.

Floating in space, Argus is picked up by the other Protectons, who have survived by combining together. They return to the surface of Skalorr, and begin plans to rebuild their world, with help from the humans, who all agree to stay and help their new allies.

But in the void of space, Nemesis still lives ...

===Robotix the movie===
In 1987, the fifteen six-minute long shorts were compiled together and released on video as ''Robotix: The Movie'', a 90-minute feature film. Directed by [[Wally Burr]], it was re-released on [[DVD]] on 28 July 2003 for [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00009XW89|title=Robotix - The Movie [1987]|work=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=2006-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6585">'''Saborios''' or '''Saborius''' ({{lang-el|Σαβώριος}}) was a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general who rose in revolt against Emperor [[Constans II (Byzantine Empire)|Constans II]] (r. 641–668) in 667–668. He sought and obtained the aid of the Caliph [[Muawiyah I]] (r. 661–680), but was killed in a [[List of horse accidents|horse accident]] before confronting the imperial troops.

==Biography==
Saborios is mentioned as being of [[Persian people|Persian]] descent by [[Theophanes the Confessor]] (his name is a rendering of the Persian [[Shapur (name)|Shapur]]), but most modern scholars regard him an [[Armenians|Armenian]].&lt;ref name="ODB"&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|p=1824}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1997|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is sometimes identified with a certain Pasagnathes, "''[[patrikios]]'' of the Armenians", who rebelled in 651/652.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;

In 667, Saborios was the governing general (''[[strategos]]'') of the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of the [[Armeniacs]], covering the northeastern part of Byzantine [[Anatolia]]. At the time, and for several years, Emperor Constans II had been residing in [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] in [[Sicily]], having left the capital [[Constantinople]] in the hands of his young son, co-emperor, and eventual successor, [[Constantine IV]] (r. 668–685). In the emperor's absence, Caliph Muawiyah had sent a series of devastating raids into [[Anatolia]], targeting chiefly the Armeniac theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|pp=319–320}}; {{harvnb|Turtledove|1982|p=48}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taking advantage of the absence of many soldiers of the other themes with Constans in Sicily, Saborios launched a revolt in late 667. In order to secure his rear, he sent one of his generals, Sergios, to [[Damascus]] to enlist Muawiyah's support. Constantine, learning of the rebellion, also sent an envoy, the eunuch ''[[koubikoularios]]'' Andrew, to the caliph. Andrew, however, could not match the rebel's offer of a heavy tribute ("the entire public revenues" according to Theophanes) and Muawiyah agreed to support Saborios with troops.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Theophanes49"&gt;{{harvnb|Turtledove|1982|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KaegiB228"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaegi|1992|p=228}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this setback, Andrew arranged for Sergios, who had insulted him during the negotiations, to be captured at a pass near [[Arabissus]] in [[Cilicia]] by troops loyal to the emperor. Sergios was then castrated and impaled on a stake.&lt;ref name="Theophanes49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KaegiB228"/&gt; 

Nevertheless, with his eastern flank secure, Saborios marched west towards Constantinople, and succeeded in gaining control over most of Anatolia. He camped with his men at Hexapolis, also known as Hadrianopolis, in [[Bithynia]], where he drilled his troops and awaited the arrival of the Arab army. Saborios was readying his men to face an oncoming loyalist army under the ''patrikios'' Nikephoros, when his horse bolted, slamming his head on a city gate and killing him.&lt;ref name="ODB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turtledove|1982|pp=49–50}}; {{harvnb|Kaegi|1981|pp=166–167}}; {{harvnb|Treadgold|1997|p=320}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Armeniac troops, left leaderless, quickly submitted, and by the time the [[Arabs|Arab]] troops arrived, the revolt was effectively over. The Arab army used the turmoil to raid as far as the [[Bosporus]] and capture [[Amorion]], but the city was retaken by the Byzantines during the following winter.&lt;ref name="KaegiB228"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Turtledove|1982|p=50}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Saborios's rebellion did not result in any territorial losses for Byzantium, but was important nonetheless as the first attested rebellion of a thematic force,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaegi|1981|p=182}}.&lt;/ref&gt; heralding a number of similar revolts during the remainder of the 7th and throughout the 8th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaegi|1981|pp=167ff}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the continued occurrence of revolts, however, Saborios's fate also encouraged a belief, oft-repeated in Byzantine and Syriac sources, that death would result from rebelling against the lawful emperor in Constantinople, and from dealing with the infidel Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kaegi|1992|pp=227–229}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior''''' is a book concerning the [[Shambhala Buddhist]] vision of founder [[Chögyam Trungpa]].  The book discusses addressing personal and societal problems through the application of secular concepts such as [[basic goodness]], warriorship, bravery, and egolessness as a means toward the creation of what he calls "enlightened society". Shambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society.

The '''Smiley face murder theory''' (variations include '''Smiley face murders''', '''Smiley face killings''', '''Smiley face gang''', and others) is a theory advanced by two retired [[New York City]] [[detectives]], Kevin Gannon and Anthony Duarte, that a number of young men found dead in bodies of water across several Midwestern American states over the last decade did not accidentally [[Drowning|drown]], as concluded by [[Police|law enforcement agencies]], but were victims of a [[serial killer]] or killers. The term ''smiley face'' became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that the police had discovered [[graffiti]] depicting a [[smiley]] face near locations where they think the killer dumped the bodies in at least a dozen of the cases. The response of law enforcement investigators and other experts to Gannon and Duarte's theory has been largely skeptical.

==Gannon and Duarte's investigation==
[[File:4th-congress-letter.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Letter from Congressman [[Sam Graves]] to the Honorable [[Robert Mueller]] concerning new evidence and a request that FBI reopen the Smiley Face Killings.]]

As recently as 2008, Gannon and Duarte were examining [[evidence]]&lt;ref name="Gannon"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://kstp.com/article/stories/s419714.shtml?cat=1v=1|title=The Investigation|last=Gannon|first=Kevin|author2=Piehl, Kristi |author3=Piehowski, Justin |date=2008-04-25|work=Gannon interview (extended coverage)|publisher=KSTP|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; going back to the late 1990s that they believe connects the deaths of 45 [[college]]-age males, whose dead bodies were found in water in 11 states, often after leaving parties or bars where
they were drinking. The men, according to the former detectives, often fit a profile of being popular, athletic, and good students, and most were [[Caucasian race|white]].&lt;ref name=CNN521&gt;"[http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/05/21/smiley.face.killer/index.html Smiley face killers may be stalking college men]", [[CNN]], May 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gannon and Duarte have theorized that the young men were all murdered, either by an individual or by an organized group of killers.&lt;ref name=CNN521 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,352960,00.html Detectives: 40 Drowning Victims May Have Been Murdered by 'Smiley Face Gang']", [[Fox News]], April 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''smiley face'' became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that Gannon and Duarte had discovered [[graffiti]] depicting a [[smiley]] face near locations where they think the killer dumped the bodies in at least a dozen of the cases.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

== Reception of the theory ==

Other police forces that have investigated the deaths dispute the conclusion that the cases are linked. The [[La Crosse, Wisconsin]], police department, which was in charge of eight of the investigations, released an official statement reiterating their original conclusions that the deaths were accidental drownings of [[Inebriation|inebriated]] men and stating that no smiley face symbols were found in connection with any of these cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.graytvinc.com/documents/lcpd+release.pdf media.graytvinc.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Center for Homicide Research in Minneapolis, Minnesota, published a research brief that also attempted to scientifically refute the theory.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, et al. [http://www.chronline.org/Research%20Brief%20on%20Smiley%20Face%20Murder%20Theory%20-%20FINAL.pdf "Drowning the Smiley Face Murder Theory"] Center for Homicide Research. Retrieved 2010-07-15.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Lee Gilbertson, a [[criminal justice]] faculty member at [[St. Cloud State University]], voiced his support for the theory on an episode of ''[[Larry King Live]]'' in which the alleged murders were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0903/26/lkl.01.html Larry King Live March 26, 2009]. ''CNN Transcripts''. Retrieved on August 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal profiler [[Pat Brown (criminal profiler)|Pat Brown]] calls the serial killer theory "ludicrous", arguing that the evidence does not fit what is known about serial killers. Brown also believes that the smiley face images found in some of the cases are likely nothing more than coincidences based upon making a guess at where the body entered the water and searching a wide area until an example of smiley face graffiti can be found.  "It's not an unusual symbol," she told Matt Smith of the Minneapolis-based newspaper ''[[City Pages]]''.  "If you look in any area five miles square, I bet you could find a smiley face."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Matt |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2008/06/criminal_profil.php |title=Minneapolis/st. Paul - City Pages - The Blotter - Criminal Profiler Debunks "Smiley Face Killers" |publisher=Blogs.citypages.com |accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) has issued the following statement:

{{Quote|text=The FBI has reviewed the information about the victims provided by two retired police detectives, who have dubbed these incidents the "Smiley Face Murders," and interviewed an individual who provided information to the detectives. To date, we have not developed any evidence to support links between these tragic deaths or any evidence substantiating the theory that these deaths are the work of a serial killer or killers. The vast majority of these instances appear to be alcohol-related drownings. The FBI will continue to work with the local police in the affected areas to provide support as requested. |author=FBI National Press Office |source=FBI Statement Regarding Midwest River Deaths (April 29, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=FBI Statement Regarding Midwest River Deaths |publisher= fbi.gov |url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/fbi-statement-regarding-midwest-river-deaths }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ruben Rosario of the Pioneer Press questions the motives of Kevin Gannon.  He states that Gannon has failed to provide any factual evidence that a group of killers exists, and that others, like reporter Kristi Piehl (the original reporter of Gannon and Duarte's theory), and some of the parents of the young men, who were at first encouraged by Gannon, now wonder if he is not actually hurting the families who are trying to get over the loss of a child.  One of the parents, Bill Szostak, and Rosario even speculate that Gannon is out for either money or the notoriety and press attention.  Another parent, Kathy Geib, is working with Piehl and others, but their main goal now is just to get police to take a compulsory second look at cases of alcohol-related drownings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Column: 'Smiley-face killer' theory losing steam: Detective claimed to have big break, delivered little |date=March 7, 2010 |author=Rosario, Ruben |publisher=Pioneer Press |url=http://www.leadertelegram.com/news/daily_updates/article_dbe7c756-3460-520d-ba9a-af1a3f72daf7.html|newspaper=Leader-Telegram (Eau Claire, Wisconsin) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tribbles''' are a fictional alien species in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe.  They were conceived by screenwriter [[David Gerrold]], and first appeared in a 1967 episode titled "[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]". They are depicted as a small, furry, gentle, attractive, and slow-moving but rapidly-reproducing [[invasive species]].  Though appearing infrequently on-screen, they have become a popular feature of the ''Star Trek'' universe, featuring in [[Tribbles (game)|their own eponymous official card game]], and even lending their name to [[TRIB1|a family of proteins]] which are associated with the biology of the [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdbonline.org/fly/newgene/tribbls1.htm Tribbles entry on Interactive Fly database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hegedus Z|author2=Czibula A|author3=Kiss-Toth E|title=Tribbles: a family of kinase-like proteins with potent signalling regulatory function|journal=Cellular Signalling|date=2007|volume=19|issue=2|pages=238–50|pmid=16963228 |doi= 10.1016/j.cellsig.2006.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation==
Tribbles were first shown in an episode of the second season of the original series, "[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]" (1967).  They have appeared in several subsequent series, as well as in a number of ''Star Trek'' feature films, and in video games such as ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]''.
[[File:Tribble.jpg|thumb|right|A tribble]]

According to [[Star Trek canon]], tribbles are native to the planet [[Iota Geminorum IV]]. They appear as small bundles of fur with no other visible features. Their coloring ranges from white and grey to black, as well as speckled brown, yellow and orange. According to [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. Leonard McCoy]]'s dialogue, their only two purposes in life appear to be to eat and to reproduce, and they perform both of these functions exceptionally well. McCoy concludes that tribbles use over 50% of their metabolism for reproduction and that they are born pregnant.

Due to their tendency to over-populate, [[Starfleet]] considers tribbles to be dangerous organisms and forbids their transportation.  A creature genetically engineered to hunt tribbles was introduced in the animated episode "[[More Tribbles, More Troubles]]" (1973).  The [[Klingon]]s, in whose presence tribbles produce a convulsive, shrieking reaction, consider them "mortal enemies", as stated in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]" (1996).

==Origin==
[[David Gerrold]] has said that his original idea for tribbles was based on the well-known problems associated with the overpopulation of [[rabbits in Australia]].  He wanted a creature prop that would be cheap to produce, and took inspiration from a ball of pink fuzz attached to a key ring.  The name for tribbles was originally "fuzzies," but to avoid confusion with the [[H. Beam Piper]] novel ''Little Fuzzy,'' Gerrold brainstormed some nonsense words, arriving at "tribble".

Gerrold was concerned that he might have inadvertently plagiarized a similar creature from [[Robert A. Heinlein|Robert A. Heinlein's]] novel ''[[The Rolling Stones (novel)|The Rolling Stones]]'' (1952).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0345234022|title=Trouble with Tribbles: The Birth Sale and Final Production of One Episode|date=1973|author=David Gerrold}}:p.271&lt;/ref&gt;  These concerns were brought up by a research team, who suggested purchasing the rights to the novel. When contacted, Heinlein asked only for a signed copy of the script and later sent a note to Gerrold to thank him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn=0345234022|title=Trouble with Tribbles: The Birth Sale and Final Production of One Episode|date=1973|author=David Gerrold}}:p.274&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Godwin''' (3 March 1756&amp;nbsp;– 7 April 1836) was an English journalist, [[political philosophy|political philosopher]] and novelist. He is considered one of the first exponents of [[utilitarianism]] and the first modern proponent of [[anarchism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=godwin |title=William Godwin |last=Philp  |first=Mark|date=2006-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin is most famous for two books that he published within the space of a year: ''[[Political Justice|An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice]]'', an attack on [[political institution]]s, and ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams]]'', an early mystery novel which attacks [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] privilege. Based on the success of both, Godwin featured prominently in the radical circles of London in the 1790s. He wrote prolifically in the genres of novels, history and [[demography]] throughout his lifetime.

In the conservative reaction to [[Radicalism (historical)|British radicalism]], Godwin was attacked, in part because of his marriage to the pioneering feminist writer [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in 1797 and [[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman|his candid biography of her]] after her death from childbirth. Their daughter, later known as [[Mary Shelley]], would go on to write ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and marry the poet [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]].  With his second wife, Mary Jane Clairmont, Godwin set up The Juvenile Library, allowing the family to write their own works for children (sometimes using ''noms de plume'') and translate and publish many other books, some of enduring significance. Godwin has had considerable influence on British literature and literary culture.

== Early life and education ==
Godwin was born in [[Wisbech]] in Cambridgeshire, to John and Anne Godwin. Godwin's family on both sides were middle-class. Godwin's parents adhered to a strict form of [[Calvinism]]. Godwin was the seventh of his parent's thirteen children.&lt;ref name="Philp 1993 7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political And Philosophical Writings Of William Godwin|last=Philp|first=Mark|publisher=Pickering &amp; Chatto Limited|year=1993|isbn=1 85196 093 7|location=London|pages=7|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin's mother came from a wealthy family but due to her uncle's frivolities the family wealth was squandered. Fortunately for the family her father was a successful merchant involved in the Baltic Sea trade.&lt;ref name="Philp 1993 7"/&gt; Godwin's father, a [[Nonconformist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] in [[Guestwick]] in Norfolk, died young, and never inspired love or much regret in his son; but in spite of wide differences of opinion, tender affection always subsisted between William Godwin and his mother, until her death at an advanced age.

William Godwin was educated for his father's profession at [[Coward Trust|Hoxton Academy]], where he studied under [[Andrew Kippis]] the biographer, and Dr [[Abraham Rees]] of the ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''. At the age of 11, he became the sole pupil of [[Samuel Newton (18th century clergyman)|Samuel Newton]], a strict hyper-Calvinist, who was a  [[Sandemanian]], a disciple of [[Robert Sandeman (theologian)|Robert Sandeman]]. Godwin later characterised Newton as, "... a celebrated north country apostle, who, after Calvin damned ninety-nine in a hundred of mankind, has contrived a scheme for damning ninety-nine in a hundred of the followers of Calvin."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

He then acted as a minister at [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], [[Stowmarket]] and [[Beaconsfield]]. At Ware the teachings of the French philosophers were brought before him by a friend, [[Joseph Fawcett]], who held strong [[British republicanism|republican]] opinions. Godwin came to London in 1782, still nominally as a minister, to regenerate society with his pen – a real enthusiast, who never shrank from conclusions of the premises which he laid down. He adopted the principles of the [[Encyclopédistes]], and his own aim was the complete overthrow of all existing political, social and religious institutions. He believed, however, that calm discussion was the only thing needful to carry every change, and from the beginning to the end of his career he deprecated every approach to violence.

== Early writing ==
His first published work was an anonymous ''Life of Lord Chatham'' (1783). He published under his own name ''Sketches of History'' (1784), consisting of six sermons on the characters of [[Aaron]], [[Hazael]] and Jesus, in which, though writing in the character of an orthodox Calvinist (Godwin himself had become an atheist),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=William Godwin, philosopher, novelist, Revolutionary|year=1984|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300105445|page=240|author=Peter H. Marshall|quote=Coleridge also introduced Charles Lamb to Godwin. Lamb had shown some sympathy for the New Philosophy but the arguments of Coleridge and his own religiosity and common sense quickly turned him against it. He was particularly repelled by Godwin's atheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; his character enunciates the proposition "''God Himself has no right to be a tyrant.''" Introduced by [[Andrew Kippis]], he began to write in 1785 for the ''[[New Annual Register]]'' and other periodicals, producing also three novels now forgotten. His main contributions for the "Annual Register" were the ''Sketches of English History'' he wrote annually, which were yearly summaries of domestic and foreign political affairs. He joined a club called the Revolutionists, and associated much with [[Charles Stanhope, 3rd Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]], [[John Horne Tooke|Horne Tooke]] and [[Thomas Holcroft|Holcroft]].

==Marriage to Mary Wollstonecraft==

Godwin first met [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] at the home of their mutual publisher. [[Joseph Johnson (publisher)|Joseph Johnson]] was hosting a dinner for another of his authors, [[Thomas Paine]], and Godwin remarked years later that on that evening he heard too little of Paine and too much of Wollstonecraft; he did not see her again for some years. In the interim, Wollstonecraft went to live in France to witness the Revolution for herself, and had a child, [[Fanny Imlay]], with an American adventurer named Gilbert Imlay. In pursuit of [[Gilbert Imlay]]'s business affairs, Wollstonecraft  travelled to Scandinavia, and soon afterwards published [[Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark|a book based on the voyage]]. Godwin read it, and later wrote that "If ever there was a book calculated to make a man in love with its author, this appears to me to be the book."&lt;ref&gt;Memoirs page 95&lt;/ref&gt;

When Godwin and Wollstonecraft were reintroduced in 1796, their respect for each other soon grew into friendship, sexual attraction, and love.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 164–69; Tomalin, 245–70; Wardle, 268ff; Sunstein, 314–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Once Wollstonecraft became pregnant, they decided to marry so that their child would be legitimate. Their marriage revealed the fact that Wollstonecraft had never been married to Imlay, and as a result she and Godwin lost many friends. Godwin received further criticism because he had advocated the abolition of marriage in ''Political Justice''.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 172–74; Tomalin, 271–73; Sunstein, 330–35.&lt;/ref&gt; After their marriage at [[St Pancras Old Church|St Pancras]] on 29 March 1797, they moved into two adjoining houses in [[Somers Town, London|Somers Town]] so that they could both still retain their independence; they often communicated by notes delivered by servants.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein has printed several of these letters in order so that the reader can follow Wollstonecraft and Godwin's conversation (321ff.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin]] was born in Somers Town on 31 August 1797, the couple's only child.&lt;ref name=TheLifeandLettersofMWS&gt;Marshall, Julian. The Life and Letters of Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. London: R. Bentley and Son, 1889. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|5}} Godwin had hoped for a son and had been planning on naming the child "William."&lt;ref name="Godwin 2011"&gt;Godwin, William The Letters of William Godwin. Ed. Pamela Clemit. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2011. PDF.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 September 1797 Wollstonecraft died of complications following the birth. By all accounts, it had been a happy and stable, though brief, relationship.&lt;ref&gt;St. Clair, 173; Wardle, 286–92; Sunstein, 335–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Now Godwin, who had been a bachelor until a few months before, was distraught at the loss of the love of his life. Simultaneously, he became responsible for the care of these two young girls, the newborn Mary and toddler Fanny.

When Mary was three, Godwin left his daughters in the care of James Marshall while he travelled to Ireland. Godwin's tone in his letters demonstrates how much he cared about them.  His letters show the stress he placed on giving his two daughters a sense of security.  "And now what shall I say for my poor little girls? I hope they have not forgot me. I think of them every day, and should be glad, if the wind was more favourable, to blow them a kiss a-piece from Dublin to the Polygon.. but I have seen none that I love so well or think half so good as my own."&lt;ref name="Godwin 2011"/&gt;

==Second marriage and book publishing==
In 1801 Godwin married his neighbour Mary Jane Clairmont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.wlv.ac.uk/btw/authors/1055|title=Mary Jane Godwin (Author, Translator) - British Travel Writing|first=Ben|last=Colbert|date=|website=University of Wolverhampton|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She brought two of her own children into the household, Charles and [[Claire Clairmont|Claire]].

In 1805 the Godwins set up a shop and publishing house called the Juvenile Library, significant in the [[Children's literature#Origins of the modern genre|history of children's literature]]. Through this, Godwin wrote children's [[Primer (textbook)|primers]] on Biblical and classical history, and using the pseudonym ''Edward Baldwin'', he wrote a variety of books for children, including a version of [[Jack and the Beanstalk]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=William B.|title=Classics Illustrated: A Cultural History|type=Hardback|edition=Abridged|date=November 2001|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-7864-1077-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a biography of the Irish artist [[William Mulready]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mitchell|first1=Sally|title=Victorian Britain (Routledge Revivals): An Encyclopedia|date=1988|page=516}}&lt;/ref&gt; who illustrated works for them.

The Juvenile Library also translated European authors. The first English edition of ''[[Swiss Family Robinson]]'' was translated (from the French, not the German) and edited by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=hahn|first1=Daniel|title=The Oxford Companion to Children's Literature|page=234|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Mb66BwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq=godwin+children+publisher#v=onepage&amp;q=godwin%20children%20publisher&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 October 2017|isbn=9780199695140|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BLAMIRES, David. 6.

==Children==
[[File:Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797).jpg|thumb|Mary Wollstonecraft by John Opie (c. 1797)]]
Godwin was responsible for a family of five children, none of whom had the same two parents. Although he raised them with his second wife, the ghost of Mary Wollstonecraft hovered over the family, as evidenced by the [[John Opie]] portrait to which Godwin gave pride of place in his study.

The eldest was [[Fanny Imlay]] (1794–1816), who committed suicide as a young woman.

Half a year younger than her was [[Claire Clairmont]], Mary Jane's only daughter, to whom she showed favouritism. The youngest, and the only child of the second marriage, was [[William Godwin the Younger]] (1803 &amp;ndash; 1832). Godwin sent him first to [[Charterhouse School]] and then to various other establishments of a practical bent. Nonetheless, he eventually earned his living by the pen. He died at 29, leaving the manuscript of a novel, which Godwin saw into print. All of Godwin's children who lived into adulthood worked as writers or educators, carrying on his legacy and that of his wives. Only two of them had children who in turn survived: [[Percy Florence Shelley]], and the son and daughter of Charles. Godwin did not welcome the birth of [[Allegra Byron]], but Claire's only child died aged five.

Godwin had high hopes for Mary, giving her a more rigorous intellectual experience than most women of her period, and describing her as "very intelligent." He wished to give his daughter a more "masculine education" and prepared her to be a writer. However, Godwin withdrew his support as Mary became a woman and pursued her relationship with [[Percy Shelley]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Julie Ann. England's First Family of Writers: Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin, Mary Shelley. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's first two novels, ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Mathilda (novella)|Mathilda]]'', may be seen as a reaction to her childhood. Both explore the role of the father in the child's socialisation and the control the father has on the child's future.&lt;ref name=HideousProgeny&gt;Hill-Miller, Katherine.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Shelley's last two novels, ''[[Lodore]]'' and ''[[Falkner (novel)|Falkner]]'', re-evaluate the father-daughter relationship.  They were written at a time when Shelley was raising [[Percy Florence Shelley|her only surviving child]] alone and supporting her ageing father. In both novels, the daughter eludes the father's control by giving him the traditional maternal figure he asks for. This relationship gives the daughter control of the father.&lt;ref name= HideousProgeny /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenlee|first1=Alison M.|title=The Swiss Family Robinson and… Frankenstein?|url=http://orgs.utulsa.edu/spcol/?p=1208|website=University of Tulsa|accessdate=16 October 2017|date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years and death==
Godwin was awarded a [[sinecure]] position as Office Keeper and Yeoman Usher of the Receipt of the Exchequer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Events|url=http://godwindiary.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/events/pu0282.html|website=William Godwin's Diary|publisher=Bodleian Library|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which came with [[grace and favour]] accommodation within the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice|date=2013|publisher=OUP|edition=Oxford World Classics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Godwin came to expect maternal support and consolation from his daughter. Two of the five children he had raised had pre-deceased him, and two more lived abroad. Mary responded to his expectations and she cared for him until he died in 1836.  He was buried next to Mary Wollstonecraft in the churchyard of St Pancras, where they had married. His second wife outlived him, and eventually was buried there too. The three share a gravestone. In the 1850s, Wollstonecraft and Godwin's remains were moved to Bournemouth, to [[St Peter's Church, Bournemouth#Notable worshippers and burials|the family tomb of the Shelleys]].

==Works and ideas==
=== ''Enquiry Concerning Political Justice'' and ''Caleb Williams'' ===
In 1793, while the [[French Revolution]] was in full swing, Godwin published his great work on [[political science]], ''[[Political Justice|Enquiry concerning Political Justice, and its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness]]''. The first part of this book was largely a recap of [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[A Vindication of Natural Society]]'' – an [[anarchism|anarchist]] critique of the [[State (polity)|state]]. Godwin acknowledged the influence of Burke for this portion. The rest of the book is Godwin's positive vision of how an anarchist (or [[minarchism|minarchist]]) society might work. ''Political Justice'' was extremely influential in its time: after the writings of Burke and [[Thomas Paine|Paine]], Godwin's was the most popular written response to the French Revolution. Godwin's work was seen by many as illuminating a middle way between the fiery extremes of Burke and Paine. Prime Minister [[William Pitt the Younger|William Pitt]] famously said that there was no need to censor it, because at over £1 it was too costly for the average Briton to buy. However, as was the practice at the time, numerous "[[London Corresponding Society|corresponding societies]]" took up ''Political Justice'', either sharing it or having it read to the illiterate members. Eventually, it sold over 4000 copies and brought literary fame to Godwin.

Godwin augmented the influence of ''Political Justice'' with the publication of a novel that proved equally popular, ''[[Things as They Are; or, The Adventures of Caleb Williams]]''. This tells the story of a servant who finds out a dark secret about Falkland, his aristocratic master, and is forced to flee because of his knowledge. ''Caleb Williams'' is essentially the first thriller:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Marshall, Peter | title=Demanding the Impossible | publisher=Harper Collins | year=1992|page=196| title-link=Demanding the Impossible }}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin wryly remarked that some readers were consuming in a night what took him over a year to write. Not the least of its merits is a portrait of the justice system of England and Wales at the time and a prescient picture of domestic espionage. His literary method, as he described it in the introduction to the novel, also proved influential: Godwin began with the conclusion of Caleb being chased through Britain, and developed the plot backwards. Dickens and Poe both commented on Godwin's ingenuity in doing this.

=== Political writing ===
In response to a [[1794 Treason Trials|treason trial]] of some of his fellow [[Jacobin (politics)#United Kingdom|British Jacobins]], among them [[Thomas Holcroft]], Godwin wrote ''Cursory Strictures on the Charge Delivered by [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas|Lord Chief Justice]] [[James Eyre (judge)|Eyre]] to the Grand Jury, 2 October 1794'' in which he forcefully argued that the prosecution's concept of "constructive treason" allowed a judge to construe ''any'' behaviour as treasonous. It paved the way for a major, but mostly moral, victory for the Jacobins, as they were acquitted.

However, Godwin's own reputation was eventually besmirched after 1798 by the conservative press, in part because he chose to write a candid biography of his late wife, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], entitled ''[[Memoirs of the Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'', including accounts of her two suicide attempts and her affair (before her relationship with Godwin) with the American adventurer [[Gilbert Imlay]], which resulted in the birth of [[Fanny Imlay]].

Godwin, consistent in his theory and stubborn in his practice, practically lived in secret for 30 years because of his reputation. However, in its influence on writers such as Shelley, who read the work on multiple occasions between 1810 and 1820,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Locke, Don | title=A Fantasy of Reason: The Life &amp; Thought of William Godwin | publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul | year=1980|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kropotkin]], ''Political Justice'' takes its place with [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Areopagitica]]'' and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]]'s ''[[Emile: or, On Education|Émile]]'' as a defining anarchist and libertarian text.

=== Interpretation of political justice ===
By the words "political justice" the author meant "the adoption of any principle of morality and truth into the practice of a community," and the work was therefore an inquiry into the principles of society, government, and [[morality|morals]]. For many years Godwin had been "satisfied that monarchy was a species of government unavoidably corrupt," and from desiring a government of the simplest construction, he gradually came to consider that "government by its very nature counteracts the improvement of original mind," demonstrating [[Anti-statism|anti-statist]] beliefs that would later be considered [[Anarchism|anarchist]].

Believing in the perfectibility of the race, that there are no innate principles, and therefore no original propensity to evil, he considered that "our virtues and our vices may be traced to the incidents which make the history of our lives, and if these incidents could be divested of every improper tendency, vice would be extirpated from the world." All control of man by man was more or less intolerable, and the day would come when each man, doing what seems right in his own eyes, would also be doing what is in fact best for the community, because all will be guided by principles of pure reason.

Such optimism was combined with a strong [[empiricism]] to support Godwin's belief that the evil actions of men are solely reliant on the corrupting influence of social conditions, and that changing these conditions could remove the evil in man. This is similar to the ideas of his wife, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], concerning the shortcomings of women as due to discouragement during their upbringing.

[[Peter Kropotkin]] remarked of Godwin that when "[[redistribution of income and wealth|speaking of property]], he stated that the rights of every one 'to every substance capable of contributing to the benefit of a human being' must be regulated by justice alone: the substance must go '[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs|to him who most wants it]]'. His conclusion was communism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/petr-kropotkin-anarchism-from-the-encyclopaedia-britannica “Anarchism”] from the Encyclopædia Britannica by [[Peter Kropotkin]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Debate with Malthus ===
In 1798, [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in response to Godwin's views on the "perfectibility of society." Malthus wrote that populations are inclined to increase in times of plenty, and that only distress, from causes such as food shortages, disease, or war, serves to stem population growth. Populations in his view are therefore always doomed to grow until distress is felt, at least by the poorer segment of the society. Consequently, poverty was felt to be an inevitable phenomenon of society.&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us imagine for a moment Mr. Godwin's beautiful system of equality realized in its utmost purity, and see how soon this difficulty might be expected to press under so perfect a form of society.... Let us suppose all the causes of misery and vice in this island removed. War and contention cease. Unwholesome trades and manufactories do not exist. Crowds no longer collect together in great and pestilent cities.... Every house is clean, airy, sufficiently roomy, and in a healthy situation.... And the necessary labours of agriculture are shared amicably among all. The number of persons, and the produce of the island, we suppose to be the same as at present. The spirit of benevolence, guided by impartial justice, will divide this produce among all the members of the society according to their wants....With these extraordinary encouragements to population, and every cause of depopulation, as we have supposed, removed, the numbers would necessarily increase faster than in any society that has ever yet been known....&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''An essay on the principle of population,'' (1798) Chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malthus went on to argue that under such ideal conditions, the population could conceivably double every 25 years. However, the food supply could not continue doubling at this rate for even 50 years. The food supply would become inadequate for the growing population, and then:&lt;blockquote&gt;...the mighty law of self-preservation expels all the softer and more exalted emotions of the soul.... The corn is plucked before it is ripe, or secreted in unfair proportions; and the whole black train of vices that belong to falsehood are immediately generated. Provisions no longer flow in for the support of the mother with a large family. The children are sickly from insufficient food.... No human institutions here existed, to the perverseness of which Mr. Godwin ascribes the original sin of the worst men. No opposition had been produced by them between public and private good. No monopoly had been created of those advantages which reason directs to be left in common. No man had been goaded to the breach of order by unjust laws. Benevolence had established her reign in all hearts: and yet in so short a period as within fifty years, violence, oppression, falsehood, misery, every hateful vice, and every form of distress, which degrade and sadden the present state of society, seem to have been generated by the most imperious circumstances, by laws inherent in the nature of man, and absolutely independent of it human regulations.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Political Justice'' Godwin had acknowledged that an increase in the standard of living as he envisioned could cause population pressures, but he saw an obvious solution to avoiding distress: "project a change in the structure of human action, if not of human nature, specifically the eclipsing of the desire for sex by the development of intellectual pleasures".&lt;ref name="Medema"&gt;Medema, Steven G., and Warren J. Samuels. 2003. The History of Economic Thought: A Reader. New York: [[Routledge]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1798 version of his essay, Malthus specifically rejected this possible change in human nature. In the second and subsequent editions, however, he wrote that widespread ''moral restraint,'' i.e., postponement of marriage and pre-nuptial celibacy ([[sexual abstinence]]), could reduce the tendency of a population to grow until distress was felt.".&lt;ref&gt;
Geoffrey Gilbert, introduction to Malthus T.R. 1798. ''An essay on the principle of population''. Oxford World's Classics reprint. xviii
&lt;/ref&gt;
Godwin also saw new technology as being partly responsible for the future change in human nature into more intellectually developed beings. He reasoned that increasing technological advances would lead to a decrease in the amount of time individuals spent on production and labour, and thereby, to more time spent on developing "their intellectual and moral faculties".&lt;ref name="Medema"/&gt; Instead of population growing exponentially, Godwin believed that this moral improvement would outrun the growth of population. Godwin pictured a social utopia where society would reach a level of sustainability and engage in "voluntary communism".&lt;ref name="Medema" /&gt;

In 1820, Godwin published ''Of Population: An Enquiry Concerning the Power of Increase in the Numbers of Mankind'' as a rebuttal to Malthus' essays. Godwin's main argument was against Malthus' notion that population tends to grow exponentially. Godwin believed that for population to double every twenty-five years (as Malthus had asserted had occurred in the United States, due to the expanse of resources available there), every married couple would have to have at least eight children, given the rate of childhood deaths. Godwin himself was one of thirteen children, but he did not observe the majority of couples in his day having eight children. He therefore concluded:&lt;blockquote&gt;In reality, if I had not taken up the pen with the express purpose of confuting all the errors of Mr Malthus's book, and of endeavouring to introduce other principles, more cheering, more favourable to the best interests of mankind, and better prepared to resist the inroads of vice and misery, I might close my argument here, and lay down the pen with this brief remark, that, when this author shall have produced from any country, the United States of North America not excepted, a register of marriages and births, from which it shall appear that there are on an average eight births to a marriage, then, and not till then, can I have any just reason to admit his doctrine of the geometrical ratio.&lt;ref name="Medema" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Interest in earthly immortality ===
In his first edition of ''Political Justice'' Godwin included arguments favouring the possibility of "earthly [[immortality]]" (what would now be called [[Physical Immortality]]), but later editions of the book omitted this topic. Although the belief in such a possibility is consistent with his philosophy regarding perfectibility and human progress, he probably dropped the subject because of political expedience when he realised that it might discredit his other views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Siobhan Ni Chonailla | title='Why may not man one day be immortal?': Population, perfectibility, and the immortality question in Godwin's Political Justice | journal=History of European Ideas  | volume=33 | issue=1 | year=2007 | pages=25–39 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V9C-4KHC2WY-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=1bca737f15f7e5f78a8226406adf6975 | doi = 10.1016/j.histeuroideas.2006.06.003  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Godwin explored the themes of [[life extension]] and immortality in his [[Gothic fiction|gothic novel]] [[St. Leon (novel)|''St.&amp;nbsp;Leon'']], which became popular (and notorious) at the time of its publication in 1799, but is now mostly forgotten.
