'''Abortion in Denmark''' was fully legalized on 1 October 1973,&lt;ref name="denmark1"&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm Lovtidende for Kongeriget Danmark, Part A, 6 July 1973, No. 32, pp. 993-995]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing [[abortion|the procedure]] to be done on-demand if a woman's [[pregnancy]] has not exceeded its twelfth week.&lt;ref name="denmark1" /&gt; According to the law of [[Denmark]], the patient must be [[Age of majority|over the age of 18]] to decide on an abortion alone; [[parental consent]] is required if she is a minor.&lt;ref name="denmark1" /&gt; An abortion can be performed 
after 12 weeks if the woman's life or health are in danger. A woman may also be granted an authorization to abort after 12 weeks if certain circumstances are proved to be present (such as poor socioeconomic condition of the woman; risk of birth defects to fetus; the pregnancy being the result of rape; mental health risk to mother).&lt;ref&gt;http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Abortion was first allowed in 1939 by application; if the doctors deemed the pregnancy fell into one of three categories (harmful or fatal to the mother, high risk for birth defects, or a pregnancy borne out of rape), a woman could legally have her pregnancy terminated.&lt;ref name="denmark2"&gt;[http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/680/article/58/ The rocky road to abortion on demand]&lt;/ref&gt; A little more than half of the applications received in 1954 and 1955 were accepted; the low acceptance rates were linked to a surge of illegal abortions performed outside the confines of hospitals.&lt;ref name="denmark2" /&gt; An addendum to the 1939 law was passed on 24 March 1970,&lt;ref name="denmark1" /&gt; allowing on-demand abortions only for women under the age of 18 who were deemed "ill-equipped for motherhood," and women over the age of 38.&lt;ref name="denmark2" /&gt;

The 1973 law is still valid today and nullifies the 1970 law.&lt;ref name="denmark1" /&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, the abortion rate was 12.1 abortions per 1000 women aged 15-49 years, which is below average for the Nordic countries (Denmark, [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.thl.fi/fi/web/thlfi-en/statistics/statistics-by-topic/sexual-and-reproductive-health/abortions/induced-abortions-in-the-nordic-countries | title=Induced abortions in the Nordic countries 2013 | publisher=[[National Institute for Health and Welfare (Finland)|THL]] | date=26 March 2015 | accessdate=12 January 2016 | author=Heino, Anna|author2=Gissler, Mika}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of Danes support access to legal abortions. In 2007, polls found that 95% supported the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.avisen.dk/dansk-stoette-til-fri-abort-i-portugal_80181.aspx | title=Dansk støtte til fri abort i Portugal | publisher= avisen.dk | date=11 February 2007 | accessdate=12 November 2016 | author=Thimmer, Niels}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faroe Islands ==

Abortion on the [[Faroe Islands]] is still governed by the Danish law of 1956, which restricts abortions to the aforementioned three circumstances (pregnancy harmful or fatal to the mother, high risk for birth defects, or a pregnancy borne out of rape). While abortion policy has not formally been [[devolution|devolved]] to the [[Faroese Parliament]], Danish politicians have been unwilling to force the Danish abortion law on the more conservative Faroese population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Greenland ==

Abortion in [[Greenland]] was legalized on 12 June 1975, under legislation equivalent to the Danish law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act
| url = http://www.nun.gl/upload/files/Lov%20232%20-%201975%20Svangerskabsafbrydelse.pdf

| trans-title = Law for Greenland about termination of pregnancy
| date = 12 June 1975
| type = Law
| number = 232
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The abortion rate in Greenland is among the highest in the world, and about 5 times higher than in Denmark, with the number of abortions exceeding live births in some years. Despite being treated as a public health concern, the rate remains high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
[[File:APEC ABC.ogv|thumb|right|[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] news report of the first APEC meeting in Canberra, November 1989, featuring delegates watching the [[Melbourne Cup]].]]
The APEC was initially inspired when [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]]’s series of post-ministerial conferences, launched in the mid-1980s, had demonstrated the feasibility and value of regular conferences among ministerial-level representatives of both developed and developing economies. By 1989, the post ministerial conferences had expanded to embrace 12 members (the then six members of ASEAN and its six dialogue partners). The developments led [[Prime Minister of Australia|Australian Prime Minister]] [[Bob Hawke]] to believe the necessity of region-wide cooperation on economic matters. In January 1989, Bob Hawke called for more effective economic cooperation across the Pacific Rim region. This led to the first meeting of APEC in the [[Australia]]n capital of [[Canberra]] in November, chaired by [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Australia)|Australian Foreign Affairs Minister]] [[Gareth Evans (politician)|Gareth Evans]]. Attended by ministers from twelve countries, the meeting concluded with commitments for future annual meetings in [[Singapore]] and [[South Korea]]. Ten months later, 12 Asia-Pacific economies met in Canberra, Australia, to establish APEC. The APEC Secretariat, based in Singapore, was established to coordinate the activities of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://www.apec.org/About-Us/About-APEC/History |website=www.apec.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pecc.org/resources/regional-cooperation/601-back-to-canberra-founding-apec/file}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the meeting in 1994 in [[Bogor]], [[Indonesia]], APEC leaders adopted the Bogor Goals that aim for free and open trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific by 2010 for industrialized economies and by 2020 for developing economies. In 1995, APEC established a business advisory body named the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC), composed of three business executives from each member economy.

In April 2001, the APEC, in collaboration with five other international organisations (Eurostat, IEA, OLADE, OPEC and the UNSD) launched the Joint Oil Data Exercise, which in 2005 became the [[Joint Organisations Data Initiative]] (JODI).

==Member economies==

APEC currently has 21 members. However, the criterion for membership is that the member is a separate ''economy'', rather than a state. As a result, APEC uses the term ''member economies'' rather than ''member countries'' to refer to its members. One result of this criterion is that membership of the forum includes [[Taiwan]] (officially the Republic of China, participating under the name "Chinese Taipei") alongside [[People's Republic of China]] (see [[Cross-Strait relations]]), as well as [[Hong Kong]], which entered APEC as a British colony but it is now a [[Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China]]. APEC also includes three official observers: [[ASEAN]], the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] and the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]].&lt;ref name="apec.org"/&gt;

[[Guam]] has also been actively seeking a separate membership, citing the example of Hong Kong, but the request is opposed by the United States, which currently represents Guam.

==Business facilitation==
APEC has long been at the forefront of reform efforts in the area of business facilitation. Between 2002 and 2006 the costs of business transactions across the region was reduced by 6%, thanks to the APEC Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAPI). Between 2007 and 2010, APEC hopes to achieve an additional 5% reduction in business transaction costs. To this end, a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20101119130533/http://apec.org/apec/apec_groups/committee_on_trade.MedialibDownload.v1.html?url=%2Fetc%2Fmedialib%2Fapec_media_library%2Fdownloads%2Fcommittees%2Fcti%2Fpubs%2F2003.Par.0028.File.v1.1 Trade Facilitation Action Plan] has been endorsed. According to a 2008 research brief published by the [[World Bank]] as part of its [https://web.archive.org/web/20080530045149/http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=1697684&amp;pagePK=64168176&amp;piPK=64168140&amp;theSitePK=1697658 Trade Costs and Facilitation Project], increasing transparency in the region's trading system is critical if APEC is to meet its Bogor Goal targets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=1697684&amp;pagePK=64168176&amp;piPK=64168140&amp;theSitePK=1697658 "Transparency Reform Could Raise Trade by $148 Billion in APEC"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080530045149/http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?menuPK=1697684&amp;pagePK=64168176&amp;piPK=64168140&amp;theSitePK=1697658 |date=May 30, 2008 }} [[John S.

===Proposed FTAAP===
APEC first formally started discussing the concept of a Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific (FTAAP) at its summit in 2006 in Hanoi. However, the proposal for such an area has been around since at least 1966 and Japanese economist {{Interlanguage link multi|Kiyoshi Kojima|ja|3=小島清}}'s proposal for a Pacific Free Trade agreement proposal. While it gained little traction, the idea led to the formation of [[Pacific Trade and Development Conference]] and then the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] in 1980 and then APEC in 1989.

In the wake of the 2006 summit, economist C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the proposed parties to any agreement at that time.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. Fred Bergsten|Bergsten, C. Fred]], "Toward a Free Trade Area of the Asia Pacific", [[Peterson Institute for International Economics]] Number Pb07-2. Pdf can be found via Google. Retrieved 2014-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas convinced the APEC Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, [[ASEAN]] and existing [[free trade agreement]] (FTA) partners are negotiating as [[Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership]] (RCEP), not officially including Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebricspost.com/china-led-rcep-trade-talks-to-begin-in-may/#.VGDoinBi7ew "China-led RCEP trade talks to begin in May"], ''thebricspost.com'', April 25, 2013. Retrieved 2014-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] (TPP) without China or Russia involved has become the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dw.de/p/1Dje5 "China's President Xi touts 'Asia-Pacific dream' ahead of APEC summit"], Deutsche Welle, November 9, 2014. Retrieved 2014-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama hosted a TPP meeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Lee-Anne, [http://globalnews.ca/news/1662792/harper-obama-attend-trade-meeting-in-beijing-as-deadline-for-deal-nears/ "Harper, Obama attend Asia-Pacific trade deal meeting in Beijing"], ''The Canadian Press'', November 10, 2014. Retrieved 2014-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal for a FTAAP arose due to the lack of progress in the [[Doha round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations, and as a way to overcome the "noodle bowl" effect created by overlapping and conflicting elements of the copious free trade agreements — there were approximately 60 free trade agreements in 2007, with an additional 117 in the process of negotiation in [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Asia-Pacific]] region.&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite web|author=September 2007 — |url=http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/09northeastasia_brilliant.aspx |title=FTAAP |publisher=Brookings.edu |date=2011-09-13 |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920100958/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2007/09northeastasia_brilliant.aspx |archivedate=2011-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, ASEAN+6 countries alone had 339 free trade agreements - many of which were bilateral.{{efn|"As of January 2012 ASEAN countries have 186 FTAs implemented, signed, under negotiation or under proposal/study, which is substantial progress since… 1992. The [[ASEAN+6]] countries have a total of 339 FTAs, including between ASEAN countries and the '+6' countries."&lt;ref&gt;Chia Siow Yue. "The Emerging Regional Economic Integration Architecture in East Asia". ''Asian Economic Papers (MIT Press)''. Vol. 12, No. 1 (2013): p. 1-37&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The FTAAP is more ambitious in scope than the Doha round, which limits itself to reducing trade restrictions. The FTAAP would create a free trade zone that would considerably expand commerce and economic growth in the region.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petersoninstitute.org/publications/opeds/oped.cfm?ResearchID=655 |title=Plan B for World Trade |publisher=Petersoninstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}} No reference to numbers of FTAs.&lt;/ref&gt; The economic expansion and growth in trade could exceed the expectations of other regional free trade areas such as the [[ASEAN Plus Three]] ([[ASEAN]] + [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]).&lt;ref name="VSM"&gt;[http://www.iie.com/publications/pb/pb07-2.pdf Policy Briefs in International Economics] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt; Some criticisms include that the diversion of trade within APEC members would create trade imbalances, market conflicts and complications with nations of other regions.&lt;ref name="VG"/&gt; The development of the FTAAP is expected to take many years, involving essential studies, evaluations and negotiations between member economies.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt; It is also affected by the absence of political will and popular agitations and lobbying against free trade in domestic politics.&lt;ref name="BD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pecc.org/research/ftaap The Pacific Economic Cooperation Council - FTAAP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524154836/http://www.pecc.org/research/ftaap |date=2012-05-24 }}. PECC. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2014 APEC summit in Beijing, APEC leaders agreed to launch "a collective strategic study" on the FTAAP and instruct officials to undertake the study, consult stakeholders and report the result by the end of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2014-11/11/c_133782162.htm "APEC roadmap on FTAAP a historic decision: Xi"]. ''Xinhua'', November 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; APEC Executive Director Alan Bollard revealed in the Elite Talk show that FTAAP will be APEC's big goal out into the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.people.cn/102775/310666/index.html "Elite Talk: A talk with APEC chief Alan Bollard on China, FTAAP, New Silk Road"]. ''People's Daily Online'', November 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trans-Pacific Partnership]] includes 12 of the 21 APEC members and has provisions for the accession of other APEC members, five of which have expressed interest in membership.

==APEC Study Centre Consortium==
In 1993, APEC Leaders decided to establish a network of APEC Study Centres among universities and research institutions in member economies.&lt;ref name=ASCC&gt;[http://www.apec.org/en/Groups/Other-Groups/APEC-Study-Centers-Consortium.aspx APEC Study Center Contortium]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201162758/http://www.apec.org/en/Groups/Other-Groups/APEC-Study-Centers-Consortium.aspx |date=December 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==APEC Business Advisory Council==
The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) was created by the APEC Economic Leaders in November&amp;nbsp;1995 with the aim of providing advice to the APEC Economic Leaders on ways to achieve the Bogor Goals and other specific business sector priorities, and to provide the business perspective on specific areas of cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www2.abaconline.org/|title=Home - APEC Business Advisory Council|first=Abac|last=Online|website=www2.abaconline.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncapec.org/abac/index.html|title=National Center for APEC - About ABAC|website=www.ncapec.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each economy nominates up to three members from the private sector to ABAC. These business leaders represent a wide range of [[industry]] sectors. ABAC provides an annual report to APEC Economic Leaders containing recommendations to improve the business and investment environment in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region, and outlining business views about priority regional issues. ABAC is also the only non-governmental organization that is on the official agenda of the APEC Economic Leader's Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinaapec.org/en/about_apec/content_2.shtml|title=APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) - China APEC Development Council|website=www.chinaapec.org|accessdate=12 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual APEC economic leaders' meetings==
Since its formation in 1989, APEC has held annual meetings with representatives from all member economies. The first four annual meetings were attended by ministerial-level officials. Beginning in 1993, the annual meetings are named APEC Economic Leaders' Meetings and are attended by the [[heads of government]] from all member economies except [[Taiwan]], which is represented by a ministerial-level official. The annual Leaders' Meetings are not called summits.

===Meeting developments===
In 1997, the APEC meeting was held in [[Vancouver]]. Controversy arose after officers of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] used [[pepper spray]] against protesters. The protesters objected to the presence of [[autocratic]] leaders such as [[President of Indonesia|Indonesian president]] [[Suharto]].&lt;ref name="Pue 2000"&gt;{{cite book |first=W.

At the [[2001 Leaders' Meeting]] in [[Shanghai]], APEC leaders pushed for a new round of trade negotiations and support for a program of trade capacity-building assistance, leading to the launch of the Doha Development Agenda a few weeks later. The meeting also endorsed the Shanghai Accord proposed by the United States, emphasising the implementation of open markets, structural reform, and [[capacity building]]. As part of the accord, the meeting committed to develop and implement APEC transparency standards, reduce trade [[transaction cost]]s in the Asia-Pacific region by 5 percent over 5 years, and pursue [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]] policies relating to information technology goods and services.

In 2003, [[Jemaah Islamiah]] leader [[Riduan Isamuddin]] had planned to attack the APEC Leaders Meeting to be held in [[Bangkok]] in October. He was captured in the city of [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]], [[Thailand]] by Thai police on August 11, 2003, before he could finish planning the attack.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
[[Chile]] became the first [[South America]]n nation to host the Leaders' Meeting in 2004. The agenda of that year was focused on [[terrorism]] and commerce, [[small and medium enterprise]] development, and contemplation of free agreements and regional trade agreements.

The 2005 Leaders' Meeting was held in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. The meeting focused on the [[Doha round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) negotiations, leading up to the [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005]] held in [[Hong Kong]] in December. Weeks earlier, trade negotiations in [[Paris]] were held between several WTO members, including the United States and the [[European Union]], centred on reducing agricultural [[trade barrier]]s. APEC leaders at the summit urged the European Union to agree to reducing [[farm subsidies]]. In a continuation of the climate information sharing initiative established by APEC Climate Network working group, it was decided by the leaders to install the [[APEC Climate Center]] in [[Busan]]. Peaceful protests against APEC were staged in Busan, but the meeting schedule was not affected.

At the Leaders' Meeting held on November 19, 2006 in [[Hanoi]], APEC leaders called for a new start to global free-trade negotiations while condemning terrorism and other threats to security. APEC also criticised [[North Korea]] for conducting a [[2006 North Korean nuclear test|nuclear test]] and a [[2006 North Korean missile test|missile test launch]] that year, urging the country to take "concrete and effective" steps toward [[nuclear disarmament]]. Concerns about [[nuclear proliferation]] in the region was discussed in addition to economic topics. The [[United States]] and [[Russia]] signed an agreement as part of Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization.

The [[APEC Australia 2007]] Leaders' Meeting was held in [[Sydney]] from 2–9 September 2007. The political leaders agreed to an "aspirational goal" of a 25% reduction of energy intensity correlative with economic development.&lt;ref name=wnn&gt;{{cite web | publisher= [[World Nuclear News]] | url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/energyEnvironment/APEC_supports_nuclear_agrees_climate_targets.shtml | title = Apec supports nuclear, agrees climate targets | date = 2007-09-10 | accessdate=2007-09-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071004151857/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/energyEnvironment/APEC_supports_nuclear_agrees_climate_targets.shtml| archivedate= 4 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme security measures including airborne sharpshooters and extensive steel-and-concrete barricades were deployed against anticipated protesters and potential terrorists. However, protest activities were peaceful and the security envelope was penetrated with ease by a [[The Chaser APEC pranks|spoof diplomatic motorcade]] manned by members of the Australian television program ''[[The Chaser]]'', one of whom was dressed to resemble the [[Al-Qaeda]] leader [[Osama bin Laden]].

The APEC USA 2011 Leaders' Meeting was held on Honolulu, Hawaii 8–13 November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.apec2011.gov/meetings/index.htm | title = Apec Honolulu Schedule |date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=November 9, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121013082225/http://www.apec2011.gov/meetings/index.htm| archivedate=2012-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===APEC leaders' group photo===
At the end of the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting the leaders gather for the official APEC Leaders' Family Photo. A tradition has the leaders dressing to reflect the culture of the host member. The tradition dates to the first such meeting in 1993 when then-U.S.&amp;nbsp;President [[Bill Clinton]] insisted on informal attire and gave the leaders leather [[Flight jacket|bomber jackets]]. At the 2010 meeting Japan had the leaders dress in smart casual rather than the traditional [[kimono]].&lt;ref name="no_kimono"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AA4H220101111 |title=No kimonos for APEC leaders in Japan |publisher=Reuters |date=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2010-11-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101115061555/https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6AA4H220101111 |archivedate=15 November 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, when Honolulu was selected in 2009 as the site for the 2011 APEC meeting, U.S.&amp;nbsp;President [[Barack Obama]] joked that he looked forward to seeing the leaders dressed in "flowered shirts and grass skirts". After viewing previous photos, and concerned that having the leaders dress in [[aloha shirt]]s might give the wrong impression during a period of economic austerity, Obama instead decided it might be time to end the tradition. Leaders were given a specially designed aloha shirt as a gift but were not expected to wear it for the photo.&lt;ref name="no_aloha_shirts"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/133780488.html?id=133780488|title=No aloha for Hawaiian shirts at APEC family photo|publisher=Honolulu Star-Advertiser|date=2011-11-13|accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders in Bali, Indonesia at the 2013 conference wore a batik outfit; in China 2014 Tang suit jackets; in Peru 2016 vicuna wool shawls; in 2017 Vietnamese silk shirts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2015/nov/17/awkward-apec-fashion-what-the-world-leaders-wore-in-pictures |title=Awkward Apec Fashion: what the world leaders wore |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=8 November 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
APEC has been criticised for promoting free trade agreements that would impose restrictions on national and local laws, which regulate and ensure labor rights, environmental protection and safe and affordable access to medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gerhardt |first=Tina |date=11 November 2011 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/view/2011/11/11-0 |title=America's Pacific Century?: APEC Summit in Hawaii Seeks to Implement Free Trade Agreement of the Asia Pacific Region |work=[[Commondreams]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the organization, it is "the premier forum for facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region" established to "further enhance economic growth and prosperity for the region and to strengthen the Asia-Pacific community".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apec.org/apec/about_apec.html About APEC – Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119101455/http://www.apec.org/apec/about_apec.html |date=November 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness and fairness of its role has been questioned, especially from the viewpoints of European countries that cannot take part in APEC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9788478 |work=The Economist |title=APEC—a pretty empty chatter |date=September 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pacific Island nations that cannot participate but stand to be affected by its decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">'''BS 7910''', guide to methods for assessing the acceptability of flaws in metallic structures, is a [[British Standards|British Standard]] code of practice for the assessment of flaws ([[welding defect|weld defects]] in particular) using [[fracture mechanics]] principles. The technique is also referred to as an engineering critical assessment (ECA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030241230 |title=BS 7910:2013 on British Standards Institute website |publisher=bsigroup.com |date= |accessdate=2014-09-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911204518/http://shop.bsigroup.com/ProductDetail/?pid=000000000030241230 |archivedate=2014-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[damage tolerance]], and is complementary to other methods of weld quality assurance.

The standard was first introduced in 1980 as a fracture and fatigue assessment procedure, when it was known as PD 6493.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/bs-7910-history-and-future-developments-july-2009/ |title=BS 7910: History and future developments |publisher=twi-global.com |date= |accessdate=2014-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its name was changed to BS 7910 following a revision in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/published-papers/pd-6493-becomes-bs-7910-whats-new-in-fracture-and-fatigue-assessment-june-1999/ |title=PD 6493 becomes BS 7910; what's new in fracture and fatigue assessment? |publisher=twi-global.com |date= |accessdate=2014-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard has undergone numerous subsequent revisions, the most recent being in 2013.

Flaws (such as fabrication cracks, [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] cracks, [[Creep (deformation)|creep]] cracks and [[corrosion]] damage) can arise during the manufacture and use of metallic components. For safety-critical items such as [[aircraft]], [[piping|pipelines]] and [[pressure vessel]]s, the failure of a single component due to the presence of a flaw can threaten human life, as well as having severe economic and environmental consequences. Other flaws may be harmless, as they will not lead to failure during the lifetime of the component. Replacement or repair of such flaws is economically wasteful. A fitness-for-service procedure such as BS 7910 allows flaws to be evaluated consistently and objectively, using fracture mechanics principles.

The '''Center for Global Nonkilling''' (originally known as the Center for Global Nonviolence) is an international [[non-profit organization]] focused on the  promotion of change toward the measurable goal of a killing-free world. The Center for Global Nonkilling is an [[NGO]] in [[Special Consultative Status]] with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] and a participant organization of the [[World Health Organization]]'s Violence Prevention Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[Violence Prevention Alliance http://www.who.int/violenceprevention/about/participants/cgnk/en/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The history of the Center for Global Nonkilling started in 1988 in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawai‘i]], as the "Center for Global Nonviolence Planning Project", an exploratory initiative set up at the [[Spark M. Matsunaga Institute of Peace]], [[University of Hawai‘i]], by Professor [[Glenn D. Paige]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonkilling.org/pdf/senate.pdf "State of Hawai'i Senate Peace Day Award" (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose was to be a creative facilitator of research, education-training, and action in the form of problem-solving leadership for nonviolent global transformation. During this phase the Center was responsible for a series of publications &lt;ref&gt;''Nonviolence in Hawaii's Spiritual Traditions'', 1991 ({{ISBN|1880309009}}); ''Buddhism and Nonviolent Global Problem-Solving: Ulan Bator Explorations'', 1991; ''Nonviolence Speaks to Power'', 1992 ({{ISBN|188030905X}}); ''[http://nonkilling.org/pdf/b3.pdf Islam and Nonviolence]'', 1993 ({{Listed Invalid ISBN|1-880309-0608}}); ''To Nonviolent Political Science: From Seasons of Violence'', 1993 ({{ISBN|1880309076}}); ''Hawai'i Journeys in Nonviolence: Autobiographical Reflections'', 1995 ({{ISBN|1880309106}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and events in partnership with the University of Hawai‘i.

In 1994 the Center for Global Nonviolence was finally established as an independent nonprofit, focusing on research and networking. Notable outcomes where the publication of ''Nonkilling Global Political Science''&lt;ref&gt;Glenn D. Paige, ''Nonkilling Global Political Science.'' Center for Global Nonkilling, 2002; 3rd ed. 2009. [http://www.nonkilling.org/node/18]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2002 and the celebration of the "First Global Nonkilling Leadership Forum" in November 2007, Co-chaired by Nobel Peace Laureate [[Mairead Maguire]]. A major outcome from the Forum was the acknowledged need and demonstrated support for establishing a successor Center for Global Nonkilling, along with an associated Global Nonkilling Leadership Academy. This would come about in 2008 with the transition from Center for Global Nonviolence to Center for Global Nonkilling.&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Forum, Glenn D. Paige, Joám Evans Pim, editors, [http://www.nonkilling.org/pdf/forum1.pdf ''Global Nonkilling Leadership'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On its official website, the Center for Global Nonkilling defines its  mission as the following:

{{Cquote|Small, creative, and catalytic in partnership with individuals and institutions locally and worldwide—by combining and sharing the spirit, science, skills, arts, institutions and resources of all—the Center for Global Nonkilling can contribute to new and renewed leadership for change towards a just, killing-free world in which everyone has the right not to be killed and the responsibility not to kill others. The means to achieve this mission include:''
* Discovering and encouraging global nonkilling human capabilities
* Introducing nonkilling knowledge in global education and policy
* Applying nonkilling knowledge in global problem-solving
* Developing and assisting nonkilling global leadership
* Assisting institutions/centers for global nonkilling
* Measuring, monitoring, and disseminating the impact of nonkilling global efforts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonkilling.org/node/39 Center for Global Nonkilling] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915231007/http://www.nonkilling.org/node/39 |date=September 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Chadian Armed Forces''' (''Forces Armées Tchadiennes'' or FAT) were the army of the central government of [[Chad]] from 1960 to 1979, under the southern presidents [[François (Ngarta) Tombalbaye|François Tombalbaye]] and [[Félix Malloum]], until the downfall of the latter in 1979, when the head of the ''[[gendarmerie]]'', [[Wadel Abdelkader Kamougué]], assumed command. Joined by gendarmerie units, FAT became a regional force representing primarily the [[Sara people|Sara]] ethnic group of the five southern [[prefectures of Chad|prefectures]]. It joined with the [[Transitional Government of National Unity]] (GUNT) forces fighting against [[Hissène Habré]] and was a recipient of aid from [[Libya]]. FAT began to disintegrate during 1982 as a result of defeats inflicted by Habré's [[Armed Forces of the North]] (FAN). Most remaining soldiers accepted integration into FAN or resumed their insurgency as ''[[codos]]''.

==Branches==
The Military of Chad is divided into three main branches of service:
*[[Chadian ground forces|Chadian National Army]]
*[[Chadian Air Force]]
*Gendarmerie

==Military statistics==
The Armed Forces of Chad have around 2.2 million women available to be drafted into their military as well as around 1.9 million men.  People are considered fit for military service in Chad at the age of 20.  People in Chad can volunteer to join the military at age 18, however if you wait until age 20 there is a 3-year service obligation.  There is also no minimum age for volunteers as long as guardian consent is given.  Women in Chad are subject to 1 year of compulsory military or civic service at the age of 21.    The government of Chad spends around 4.2% of their GDP on their armed forces.  The Chadian Armed Forces spend about One-Hundred and One million dollars in military spending.  The Chadian Armed Forces are ranked eleventh overall recent military growth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationmaster.com/country/cd-chad/mil-military&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coat of arms of Ivano-Frankivsk''' ({{lang-uk|Герб Івано-Франківська}}) is an official symbol of the [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] city. The current one was adopted on February 17, 1995.

==Former coat of arms==
[[File:POL Stanisławów COA.svg|thumb|left|City emblem during the II Polish Republic]]
The Polish city emblem was adopted at a session of the city council on March 10, 1938 and published on May 24, 1938. It was composed of a modern French [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], in the middle of which was a big white three tower castle with open front city gates. Inside the gate is the [[Piława coat of arms]], Potocki family symbol.

The '''[[Cockade]] of [[Spain]]''' is a national symbol that arose after the [[French revolution]], by pleating a golden pin over the former red ribbon,colors of the ancient [[Royal Bend of Castile]]. The resulting insignia is a circle that symbolizes the colors of the [[Flag of Spain|Spanish flag]]: [[Red]] and [[Yellow]], being carried as individual representation in case of distinctions or prizes or by other types of events. At the moment it is not used in Spain, except as a [[roundel]] for the identification of [[Spanish Armed Forces]] aircraft.

The phrase ''detente bala'' means "stop, bullet" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. 

Patches of cloth with the phrase around a [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] were worn on the chest as [[amulet|a protection]].

'''''Development as Freedom''''' is a 1999 book by economist [[Amartya Sen]], which focuses on [[international development]].

==Background==
Amartya Sen was the winner of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Economics]].  His book argues that economic ''development'' entails a set of linked ''freedoms'': 
*[[political freedom]]s and [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] in relations between people
*freedom of opportunity, including freedom to access credit; and
*economic protection from abject poverty, including through [[income supplement]]s and [[unemployment benefits|unemployment relief]]. 
A state of poverty will generally be characterised by lack of at least one freedom (Sen uses the term ''unfreedom'' for lack of freedom), including a ''de facto'' lack of political rights and choice, [[social vulnerability|vulnerability]] to coercive relations, and exclusion from economic choices and protections. From this, Sen concludes that real development cannot be reduced to simply increasing [[basic income]]s, nor to rising average per capita incomes. Rather, it requires a package of overlapping mechanisms that progressively enable the exercise of a growing range of freedoms.

His work has been criticized by those who claim that [[capitalism]]—and especially [[neo-liberal]] capitalism—reinforce unfreedoms.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Richard Sandbrook, 2000, "Globalization and the Limits of Neoliberal Development Doctrine," ''[[Third World Quarterly]]'', Vol. 21, No. 6, pp. 1071-1080&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diocese of Mikkeli''' is one of nine [[diocese]]s in the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]. It was founded in 1897 in the town of [[Savonlinna]]. Later, in 1924 the [[episcopal see]] was moved to [[Vyborg|Viipuri]], but after [[Finland]] had lost the city to the [[Soviet Union]] the see was moved to [[Mikkeli]] in 1945. There it has been ever since.

The '''Dipartimento delle Informazioni per la Sicurezza''' (DIS, "Department of Information Security") is a department of the [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|Presidency of the Council of Ministers]] of [[Italy]], instituted in 2007 as part of the [[SISMI|reform of the Italian security services]]. It is currently headed by Gianni de Gennaro, the successor to General Giuseppe Cucchi, former director of [[CESIS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/05/sezioni/politica/servizi-sicurezza/servizi-sicurezza/servizi-sicurezza.html|title=Rinnovati i vertici dei servizi — De Gennaro al Dis, Piccirillo all'Aisi|publisher=Repubblica.it|accessdate=2008-12-04|date=2008-05-23|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department is divided into several functional areas. The Central Security Office (''Ufficio Centrale per la Sicurezza'') deals specifically with administrative protection of state secrets, including the granting or withdrawal of security clearance to individuals and organisations ("Nulla Osta Security"), the Office of the Central Archives (''L'Ufficio Centrale degli Archivi'') coordinates and manages the data in the possession of the Italian secret services, and the Training School (''Scuola di Formazione'') is responsible for the training of government and civilian staff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2402">The '''[[Florin]]''' was the [[currency]] of the [[British Empire|British]] colonies and protectorates of '''[[East Africa Protectorate|East Africa]]''' between 1920 and 1921. It was divided into 100 [[Cent (currency)|cent]]s. It replaced the [[East African rupee|rupee]] at par, and was replaced in turn by the [[East African shilling|shilling]] at a rate of 2 shillings = 1 florin. The florin was equivalent to 2 [[shilling]]s [[Pound sterling|sterling]].

==Coins==

Because of its short period in existence, few of the [[coin]]s minted were actually issued and are consequently scarce today. Coins were minted in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents and 1 florin but, according to the "Standard Catalog of World Coins" (C. L. Krause &amp; C. Mishler, Krause Publications), the 50 cents coins were not released for circulation and only 30% of the 1, 5 and 10 cent coins produced were issued for circulation.

==Banknotes==

The East African Currency Board issued notes in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 500 florins, with the notes valued at 10 florins and above also carrying the denomination in [[pound sterling|pounds]] (1, 2, 5, 10 and 50).

== Embassy History ==
The first Irish diplomatic mission in Germany was established in 1929 on Drakestraße, near [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]]. This building was destroyed in an [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air-raid during World War II]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 1951, Ireland opened an Embassy in [[Bonn]], which was the ''de-facto'' capital of [[West Germany]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This embassy was eventually moved to [[Friedrichstraße]], Berlin in 2000 after [[German reunification|German Reunification.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Building ==
The embassy occupies part of 51 Jägerstraße. This building was built by the [[Mendelssohn family]] in 1789. In 1939 it was, along with a number of other buildings on Jägerstraße, forcibly sold to the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=GESCHICHTSMEILE JÄGERSTRASSE: DIE KEIMZELLE DES BERLINER BANKENVIERTELS, DER MENDELSSOHN-ORT IN BERLIN|url=https://www.berlin.de/ba-mitte/politik-und-verwaltung/aemter/amt-fuer-weiterbildung-und-kultur/geschichte/gedenktafel-datenbank/id-84_jaegerstr-ort-familie-mendelssohn.pdf|journal=Berlin.de|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Foxtel''' is an Australian [[pay television]] company, operating in [[cable television|cable]] television, [[direct-broadcast satellite|direct broadcast]] satellite television, and IPTV streaming services. It was formed in 1995 through a joint venture established between [[News Corporation]] (now [[News Corp]]; through [[News Corp Australia|News Limited]], now News Corp Australia) (FOX) and [[Telstra]] (TEL).  With Fox being the 65% and Telstra the 35% shareholders. It shares many features with the [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] service in the United Kingdom, including iQ, the [[electronic program guide]], a similar remote control, and Red Button Active.

==History==
[[File:Foxtel Melbourne headquarters.jpg|thumb|right|Foxtel headquarters in [[Southbank, Victoria]]]]
In 1995, a venture between News Corporation (in particular 20th Century Fox Media) and Telstra took place whereby Telstra would transmit a TV signal through its coaxial network and News Corporation would be the basis for offering channel negotiations and connections. Foxtel was formed ("Fox" representing News Corporation's Fox and "Tel" representing Telstra)...
On 23 October 1995, Foxtel commenced a 20 channel service, delivered over the Telstra Hybrid Fibre Coaxial network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = No fanfare as Foxtel hits the airwaves| first = Ben | last = Potter | page = 6 | newspaper = [[The Age]] | publisher = [[Fairfax Media]] | date = 23 October 1995 | accessdate = 20 February 2010 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news951023_0211_9795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1998, Australis Media, the owner of a satellite television service known as [[Galaxy (Australian television)|Galaxy]], was declared insolvent. In June 1998, Foxtel was able to significantly boost its customer base by acquiring Galaxy subscribers from the liquidator of Australis Media and immediately commenced supplying programming to Galaxy's subscribers on an interim basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Foxtel pulls off coup in battle for pay TV| first = Anne | last = Davies | page = 31 | newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]] | publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 3 June 1998 | accessdate = 26 February 2010 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news980603_0686_6609}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1999, Foxtel began offering its own satellite service to new customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Pay TV audience doubles| first = Daniel | last = Dasey | page = 33 | newspaper =  [[The Sun-Herald]] | publisher = Fairfax Media | date = 28 February 1999 | accessdate = 26 February 2010 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news990303_0617_4282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Publishing and Broadcasting Limited]] bought half of News Corporation's shares in October 1998, giving each quarter ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald | publisher = Fairfax Media | title =  Packer Makes A$150m Splash into Pay Television| first = Elisabeth | last = Sexton | page = 1 | date = 30 October 1998 | accessdate = 29 August 2010 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news981030_0390_6178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a Content Sharing Agreement between Foxtel and [[Optus Television]] was approved by the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]] (ACCC).&lt;ref name="astrahistory"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://astra.org.au/article.asp?section=2&amp;option=1&amp;content=2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312040820/http://www.astra.org.au/article.asp?section=2&amp;option=1&amp;content=2 |archivedate=12 March 2008 |title=History of Subscription TV – A Brief History | publisher=[[Australian Subscription Television and Radio Association]] (ASTRA) | accessdate=12 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 July 2011, Austar announced that "it had entered into definitive transaction agreements with Liberty Global, Inc. (LGI) and Foxtel Management Pty Limited (Foxtel) under which Foxtel will acquire Austar by a series of transactions including a scheme of arrangement (Scheme)."&lt;ref name="Foxtel Takeover"&gt;

News Corporation acquired [[Consolidated Media Holdings]] in November 2012, bringing its stake in Foxtel to 50%, up from 25%.&lt;ref name=CMHacq&gt;{{Cite news | title = News Limited seals pay TV deal after Federal Court approves CMH takeover | work = [[The Australian]] | accessdate = 4 November 2012 | date = 2 November 2012 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/news-limited-seals-pay-tv-deal-after-federal-court-approved-cmh-acqusition/story-e6frg6n6-1226509333236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FOXTEL logo 2012.png|191px|right|thumb|Foxtel logo from 2012 to 2017]]

On 15 June 2015, Foxtel officially agreed to buyout 15% shares in [[Ten Network Holdings]], subject to approval from the ACCC. Prior to the acquisition, Discovery backed out from bidding partnership with Foxtel.

In June 2017, Foxtel announced that it would be undergoing a major rebrand – the first in its 22-year history – as part of a move to convey an image that "Foxtel is for everyone". The former logo (inspired from the American Fox network's 1996-present logo), described by the company as "quite aggressive, quite arrogant, quite elitist", would be replaced with an all lowercase logo, and its Foxtel Play service would rebranded to [[Foxtel Now]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/foxtel-rebrands-officially-launches-foxtel-now-conceding-brand-seen-aggressive-449541|title=Foxtel rebrands and officially launches Foxtel Now after conceding brand was seen as ‘aggressive’|last=Kelly|first=Vivienne|date=6 June 2017|website=[[Mumbrella]]|access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 March 2018, [[News Corp Australia]] announced a merger of [[Fox Sports (Australia)]] with Foxtel (co-owned by News Corp Australia and [[Telstra]]). News Corp owns a 65 percent stake in the combined entity, with Telstra owning 35 percent.&lt;ref name="Foxtel and Fox Sports merger"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foxtel and Fox Sports merger|url=https://finance.nine.com.au/2018/03/06/10/34/news-corp-and-telstra-green-light-foxtel-and-fox-sports-merger|publisher=9News|date=March 6, 2018|accessdate=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combining of the two businesses places emphasis on live-streaming sports and entertainment.

==Ratings==
Foxtel grew rapidly in 2007, with most of Foxtel's highest-ever rating events being broadcast that year, including the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]] quarter-final between [[Australia national association football team|Australia]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]], which drew an average of 419,000 viewers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/56973,japan-game-a-tv-record.aspx |title=Japan Game a TV Record |work=[[FourFourTwo (Australia)|FourFourTwo Australia]] |publisher=[[Haymarket Media Group|Haymarket Group]] |date=23 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928021200/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/56973,japan-game-a-tv-record.aspx |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; an Australian pay television record at that time. This ratings record has since been eclipsed by the 2011 Rugby World Cup on Fox Sports 1 averaging around 500,000 viewers, which was smashed by the [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] Coverage, broadcast on 8 dedicated channels in both HD and SD formats, which saw an average of 946,432 viewers tuning in on the opening weekend, with around 600,000 to 700,000 viewers nightly thereafter.

As of 2012, [[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] channels, particularly [[Fox Footy]], average between 90,000 and 300,000 + viewers for NRL/AFL matches throughout the week.
The highest-rated light entertainment shows are [[The Simpsons]] most weeknights on FOX8 with around 110,000 viewers, as well as [[Family Guy]] with around 70,000 viewers. A&amp;E has also recorded healthy audience numbers for its [[TruTV]] &amp; [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E US]] syndicated shows from the US&amp;nbsp;– [[Pawn Stars]] (85,000), [[Hardcore Pawn]] (85,000), and [[Storage Wars]] (90,000). [[BBC UKTV]] also consistently rates well with British soaps [[EastEnders]] (80,000) and [[Coronation Street]] (65,000). The LifeStyle channel has experienced audiences in excess of 100,000 people for its Premiere shows [[Location, Location, Location Australia]], [[Grand Designs Australia]], [[Selling Houses Australia]], [[Disney Channel (Australia)]]  and [[The Real Housewives of Melbourne]] brings strong ratings.

==Availability==
Foxtel transmits its cable service via [[Telstra]] [[hybrid fibre-coaxial]] (HFC) cable into the [[Brisbane]], Sydney, [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] metropolitan areas, along with the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. Foxtel now also transmits its satellite service into these cities as well as all over Australia including regional areas since the takeover of Austar, previous Austar customers are now 100% Foxtel customers with the conversion from Austar to Foxtel in regional Australia is now complete, however, satellite service is not supplied to user sites where Telstra HFC cable is available in metropolitan areas. Foxtel on Mobile launched on Telstra's Next G Network in late 2006 and is now available within Telstra Next G (HSDPA/850&amp;nbsp;MHz) coverage areas, which covers 99% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the Next G® network?|url=http://www.telstra.com.au/mobile/nextg/?red=/mobile/nextg/coverage.html|publisher=[[Telstra]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telstra's network and Foxtel were created to combat the threat posed to Telstra's local call business by the combination of [[Optus Television|Optus Vision]] (now known as Optus TV) content bundling with [[Optus]]' local telephony services; Foxtel was the content arm of Telstra's defence strategy, while Telstra's multimedia broadband network was originally the sole delivery system.

In 2002, Foxtel and Optus Television agreed to a content-sharing arrangement. Programming competition between the two companies has now dissipated. Prior to its acquisition by Foxtel in 2011, [[Austar]], a regional [[pay television]] operator, also carried most Foxtel programming.

Foxtel announced its maiden annual profit in 2006, more than 10 years after it commenced services. The installation and maintenance of Foxtel services is Telstra's responsibility. In many markets Telstra has outsourced installation and maintenance to large communications contractors, including [[ABB Asea Brown Boveri|ABB Communications]] and Siemens-Thiess Communications Joint Venture.

In 2007, [[Network Ten]] formed an agreement with Foxtel to allow them to carry a digital version of Ten's programming. Included in the deal is [[electronic program guide]] data, which allows Foxtel iQ users to schedule recordings on Ten. Before the agreement, Ten was carried in an analogue format on cable only.

In 2008, [[Seven Network]] finally entered an agreement to allow Foxtel to carry its SD signal.

In 2008, the first Pay TV package comparison site YouCompare was launched to allow Foxtel packages and pricing to be compared to [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]], however this service was ceased along with the ceasing of [[SelecTV (Australian television)|SelecTV]]'s service in late 2010.

On 15 November 2009, Foxtel released an additional 25 channels to satellite and cable subscribers, consisting of high definition channels, movie and theme channels, and several new time-shifted channels.  As part of the release, Seven began broadcasting to satellite subscribers in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

On 24 November 2009, Foxtel added [[7TWO]] to the East Coast (satellite) and 7TWO and [[Go! (Australian TV channel)|GO!]] to cable subscribers. [[ABC3]] was recently introduced on 4 December 2009 to all Foxtel and [[Austar]] subscribers.

On 20 May 2010, Foxtel and [[Microsoft]] announced a new way of receiving Foxtel through Xbox 360's online service Xbox LIVE. The service launched November 2010 with 30+ channels and an additional 12 Video-on-demand channels. It also provided Foxtel's movie service, known as Foxtel On Demand, to non-subscribers for the first time on a pay-per-view basis. Further linear channels were added in April 2011 with the addition of 7 Telstra BigPond channels.

In June 2011, Foxtel launched an over-the-top service on Telstra's IPTV set top box called Foxtel on T-Box carrying the same services as the Foxtel on Xbox service. Also as of June 2011, Foxtel's subscribers numbered just over 1.65 million.

In November 2014, Foxtel added 2 new SD channels, 9 new HD channels and rebranded 2 sports channels to satellite and cable subscribers.

==Current services==
Although originally launching in 1995 with just a cable service, Foxtel has branched out into many new services since its inception including broadband and phone services in 2014.

=== Foxtel app ===
Foxtel subscribers are able to access live and on-demand content within packages they are subscribed to through the internet via the Foxtel app. The service was formerly known as Foxtel Go prior to a company wide rebrand in June 2017.

Foxtel launched the Foxtel Go service on 7 November 2012.&lt;ref name="Foxtel Go Launch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/watch-foxtel-go-on-your-ipad-204175.htm|title=Watch Foxtel Go on your iPad – included in your subscription|website=Foxtel|publisher=Foxtel|accessdate=8 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813135749/http://www.foxtel.com.au/whats-on/foxtel-insider/watch-foxtel-go-on-your-ipad-204175.htm|archive-date=13 August 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was only available on [[iPad]], but from 20 February 2013 it was also available on [[iPhone]], and later on [[OS X|Mac]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows PC]] and selected [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices. Foxtel Go was launched after the success of its London 2012 app, which simulcast 8 live [[High-definition television|high definition]] channels that were also offered on the standard Foxtel service.&lt;ref name="Foxtel London 2012 App"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxtel.com.au/about-foxtel/communications/take-the-olympic-games-with-you-foxtel-london-2012-app-for-t-194906.htm|title=Take The Olympic Games With You Foxtel London 2012 App for tablet|website=Foxtel|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Access to the Foxtel app is free for residential customers with a set-top box and a Foxtel or Foxtel Now subscription, allowing access to any channel that they are subscribed to. The Sky News service can be accessed through the service without an account. Only five devices can be linked to an account during any given month with only two being able to view content at the same time, and only one device change is permitted per month.

Unlike Mobile Foxtel (provided by [[Telstra]]) – which only provides a loop of selected shows&amp;nbsp;– the Foxtel app offers a live simulcast of the channels available through the traditional cable and satellite services. The service also has no time limits; Mobile Foxtel offers only 15 minutes of programming per session, or a maximum 200 minutes per month.&lt;ref name="MobileFoxtel v Go"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telstra.com.au/entertainment/entertainment-on-the-move/|title=Telstra – Entertainment on the move – Mobile Foxtel – Foxtel Go|publisher=Telstra|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foxtel Now===
{{main article|Foxtel Now}}
Foxtel Now (Formerly Foxtel Play) is an [[internet television]] alternative to the traditional Foxtel subscription, offering customers a no lock in contract subscription starting at $10. The service offers over 50 live channels and hundreds of hours of video on-demand content across 6 subscription packages.

The service is available across a range of devices such as computers, TVs and video game consoles. In addition, subscribers have access to Foxtel's Foxtel Go app expanding access to smartphones and tablets.

On 4 October 2016, Foxtel announced that a new look Foxtel Play streaming service will roll out from December 2016 and that Foxtel Play will be a simpler, cheaper and more flexible IP-delivered product.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Announcements/Foxtel-revamps-its-streaming-video-service/m-p/154606#M5366|title=Foxtel revamps its streaming video service|date=2016-10-04|access-date=2016-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a company wide rebrand in June 2017, Foxtel announced that from 7 June, Foxtel Play would be renamed Foxtel Now and would gain [[High-definition television|HD]] streaming and [[Chromecast]] support with a lower starting price of $10 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2017/06/foxtel-now-lands-with-10-entry-hd-chromecast.html|title=Foxtel Now lands with $10 entry, HD &amp; Chromecast|last=Knox|first=David|date=6 June 2017|website=[[TV Tonight]]|access-date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foxtel Guide===
On 5 December 2009, Foxtel launched a mobile TV guide for the Apple [[iPhone]], dubbed "Foxtel Guide". Features include: remote record for iQ and iQ2, free to air listings, program descriptions and classifications. The application is free to download from the iPhone [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and is available to non-subscribers (with the exception of the ability to remote record). On 25 February 2011, Foxtel released an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] application which is available as a free app from [[Google Play]].  The app is optimised for both Android smartphones and tablets.

===Foxtel magazine===
The Foxtel magazine contains daily listings for most channels offered on the Foxtel platform.

Foxtel subscribers can opt-in and subscribe to the Foxtel magazine for a monthly fee. Legacy Foxtel Platinum subscribers who opted in for the magazine prior to the Platinum magazine unbundling period in mid-2010, currently still continue to get the magazine free of charge.

Foxtel's magazine is Australia's most-read paid-for monthly magazine, with a monthly reach of about 700,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roymorgan.com/news/press-releases/2012/1572/|title=ItemNotFound|website=Roy Morgan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223135750/http://www.roymorgan.com/news/press-releases/2012/1572/|archivedate=23 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published for Foxtel by Medium Rare Content Agency, and distributed to Foxtel subscribers (who choose to pay for this service) by via post.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = News' Medium Rare Content Snares Foxtel Mag From Bauer| work = B&amp;T| accessdate = 2017-10-23| date = 2015-06-15| url = http://www.bandt.com.au/media/news-medium-rare-content-snares-foxtel-mag-from-bauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxtel no longer offers the magazine free to new "Platinum" subscribers. The change to this policy was introduced by Foxtel to reduce physical waste (paper and associated environmental impact) from printing the monthly magazine, and to reduce monthly costs associated with printing and posting overhead for the Foxtel magazine, to all legacy Platinum customers who decided not to opt-in during the opt-in period in early 2010.

As of February 2016, the magazine no longer lists the sports channels.

===FoxFlicks===
In August 2018, Foxtel launched a streaming VOD (video on demand) movie service called FoxFlicks. This service is available to subscribers who have either the movie pack or platinum pack with an iQ3 or iQ4 [[set-top-box]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mediaweek.com.au/foxtel-launches-foxflicks-streaming-demand-movie-service/|title=Foxtel launches FoxFlicks streaming on demand movie service|website=mediaweek.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Past Services ==

===Foxtel Digital===
[[File:Foxtel.svg|191px|right|thumb|Foxtel Digital logo]]

Foxtel launched its digital service (Foxtel Digital) in March 2004. The service is loosely based on another of News Corporation's subscription providers, [[BSkyB]]. Features of the digital service include:
* Switching to [[widescreen]] for most channels
* Selected movies in [[Dolby Digital]] [[5.1 surround sound]] and [[Dolby Vision]]
* [[Pay-per-view]] and [[Video on demand#Near video on demand|Near Video on Demand]] services
* [[Interactive television]] services including multiple camera angle sports, news, games and others
* An [[Electronic program guide]]
* "+2" timeshift channels of popular channels, showing programs two hours later than the original channel

Like many other News Corporation-owned digital platforms, Foxtel uses [[NDS Group]] encryption system, electronic program guide and digital video recorder services, the OpenTV interactive platform, and primarily runs on [[Pace Micro Technology]] set-top boxes.

Foxtel's satellite service transmits exclusively from the [[Optus fleet of satellites|Optus C1 satellite]] on a primary [[downlink]] frequency of 12.438&amp;nbsp;GHz expanded to adjacent frequencies, with further expansion during November 2009 of frequencies on the Optus D3 satellite.  The [[Telstra]] [[hybrid fibre-coaxial]] cable carries Foxtel with an approximate downstream bandwidth of 560&amp;nbsp;MHz with an upstream return (for internet, on-demand, phone and other two-way dependent services) bandwidth of 2.4&amp;nbsp;MHz.

As of April 2007, all Foxtel subscribers are using the digital set-up, making Foxtel Digital synonymous with the standard Foxtel service.

===Foxtel HD===
[[File:FOXTEL HD.png|right|200px|thumb|Foxtel HD+ Logo]]
Foxtel announced their [[high-definition television|High Definition]] service originally called Foxtel HD+ on 30 January 2008, and became officially available on 19 May 2008 at a nominal price of $10 AUD despite similar "HD" resolution broadcast channels already available on free-to-air television. The service offers fifteen channels in High Definition, Arena HD, Lifestyle HD, FOX8 HD, Universal HD, Showcase HD, Boxsets HD, Binge HD, BBC First HD, 13th Street HD, FX HD, A&amp;E HD, Syfy HD, Foxtel Arts HD, Foxtel Movie Network (More Movies HD, Premier HD, Masterpeice HD, Family HD, Action HD, Thriller HD, Disney HD, Comedy HD, Romance HD), World Movies HD, FOX Sports (FS News HD, 3HD, 5HD), FOX Footy, FOX Cricket, FOX League, ESPN (ESPN HD, ESPN2 HD), Main Event HD, Eurosport HD, Sky Thoroughbred HD, BeIN Sports (1HD, 2HD, 3HD), Chelsea TV HD, LFCTV HD, MUTV HD, National Geography (National Geography HD, National Geography Wild HD), Discovery HD, History HD, BBC Knowledge HD, Sky News (Sky News HD, Sky News Business HD, Sky News Election HD), as well as Foxtel Box Office HD and a retransmission of the free-to-air networks' high definition channels: [[ABC HD (Australian TV channel)|ABC HD]], [[SBS HD]], [[7HD]], [[9HD]] and [[10 HD]] to cable customers.&lt;ref name="Retransmission"&gt;[http://hd.foxtel.com.au/blog/2008/02/retransmission-on-foxtel.html Retransmission on Foxtel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430131118/http://hd.foxtel.com.au/blog/2008/02/retransmission-on-foxtel.html |date=30 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxtel HD (current name) is broadcast in [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] and provides channels in both [[720p]] and [[1080i]]. As of 2011, almost a third of Foxtel's customers were receiving the HD service.&lt;ref name="Foxtel.com.au" /&gt;

===Foxtel on Demand===
Foxtel on Demand was a service offered by Foxtel to iQ subscribers that allowed people to watch selected shows and movies whenever they wanted. Foxtel on Demand was launched on 8 February 2007, with a variety of programmes and included the entire second season of ''[[Love My Way]]''.

The service was available to all Foxtel customers with an iQ set top unit, however the programming able to be played was typically restricted to the channels that the customer was subscribed to.  For example, customers not subscribed to the movie channels were not able to view the stored movies.

===Foxtel Download===
On 1 October 2009, Foxtel launched an online download service which allows all cable and satellite customers to access Foxtel content via their computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Field|first=Katherine|title=Foxtel to launch download service, 12 new channels|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,28383,26142218-10229,00.html|work=[[News Limited#Websites|News.com.au]]|publisher=News Limited|date=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service is free for customers, who can download programs from channels within their subscription package. There is currently one live streaming channel, ESPN3, while the remainder of the service provides episodes of programs from 38 channels. Then CEO, [[Kim Williams (media executive)|Kim Williams]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mindthegp.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/foxtel1.jpg|title=Mindthegp.files.wordpress.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; highlighted that Foxtel planned to expand its live streaming channel range later in the year to coincide with the [[2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics]] and the launch of thirty new channels for Foxtel Digital and HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Major|first=Rose|title=Foxtel Download on track for October|url=http://www.rapidtvnews.com/index.php/200909234783/foxtel-download-on-track-for-october.html|publisher=Rapid TV News|date=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This service has been the source of great controversy as there was no support for Linux, Mac or any 64 bit Windows Operating Systems, leaving many users unable to install the client.
Foxtel Download was discontinued in September 2012, with the service no longer being available to subscribers.

===Mobile Foxtel===
Launched in late 2006 to coincide with [[Telstra]]'s NextG 3G Mobile phone network, Mobile Foxtel (previously Foxtel By Mobile) offers 33 standard channels of programming for a small subscription fee, optimised for mobile devices. At present the channels available are:&lt;ref name="foxtelonmobile"&gt;{{cite web|title=What We Do |url=http://www.foxtel.com.au/about-foxtel/what-we-do/default.htm |publisher=Foxtel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822070301/http://www.foxtel.com.au/about-foxtel/what-we-do/default.htm |archivedate=22 August 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky News|Sky News National]], [[Your Money (TV channel)|Your Money]], [[CNN]], [[Fox Sports News]], [[Fox8]], [[The Comedy Channel]], [[MTV]], [[E!

With the exception of CNN, Fashion TV, Eurosportsnews, Eurosport, Fox News, BBC World News and Fox Sports News, which are direct simulcasts of the actual channel and Sky News channels which are taken from the Sky News Active service, all channels are pre-produced loops that do not directly correlate to the full scale satellite/cable channel. At present, a limit of 200 minutes per month, with 15 minutes per session, may apply to the service, although this has not been strictly enforced.&lt;ref name="foxtelonmobile" /&gt;

The service was discontinued on 27 July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://crowdsupport.telstra.com.au/t5/Telstra-Product-Exits/Mobile-Foxtel-Exit/ba-p/571685|title=Mobile Foxtel Exit - Telstra Crowdsupport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foxtel on Xbox 360 and Internet TV===
{{main article|Foxtel On}}
Foxtel launched in November 2010 for the [[Xbox 360]] games console, offering 38 channels, catch-up television and on-demand movie streaming. It requires both an [[Xbox Live Gold]] subscription and a Foxtel subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foxtel on Xbox 360|url=http://www.foxtel.com.au/xbox/default.htm|publisher=Foxtel}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Smart TV|Samsung Smart TVs]] received the same service at no additional cost in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.whistleout.com.au/Broadband/News/samsung-tvs-see-boxless-foxtel|title=Samsung TVs See Boxless Foxtel|publisher=Whistleout}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been replaced with Foxtel Now.

===Presto===
{{Main article|Presto (company)}}
In 2014, Foxtel launched a movie streaming operation ''Presto'', which was initially priced at AU$19.99, but was halved a few months later. Presto was spin-off a television streaming service with [[Seven West Media]] in early 2015.&lt;ref name="Presto"&gt;{{cite web|author=|publisher=[[news.com.au]]|date=8 December 2014|accessdate=8 December 2014|title=Foxtel and Seven West combine to fight Netflix and Stan with Presto Entertainment|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/home-entertainment/foxtel-and-seven-west-combine-to-fight-netflix-and-stan-with-presto-entertainment/story-fn8tnfhb-1227148300038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foxtel announced the Presto service will be closed in January 2017, and customers moved to a Foxtel Now service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/tv/foxtel-customers-the-winner-as-streaming-service-presto-closes-in-january-2017/news-story/085497337ae3ed5b130e23a0e126c8a1|title=Programs find new home on Foxtel Play|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Devices==

Foxtel devices are manufactured by [[Pace plc]] on behalf of Foxtel - they have manufactured a verity of devices including:

===Foxtel Standard===
There is a variety of Foxtel standard units. These lack the recording features of the iQ models, but can be connected to a VCR or DVR. Foxtel has phased out the standard boxes for all new installations and installs the iQHD instead. The additional features of the iQ models (such as recording) can be deactivated if the customer does not wish to pay for them, in effect making them operate as if they were a standard model.

===Foxtel iQ===
Foxtel launched Foxtel iQ in early 2005. It is a [[timeshifting]] [[Personal video recorder|personal digital recorder]] in which subscribers are able to record programs onto a [[hard drive]] inside the [[set-top unit]] for later viewing. Foxtel iQ includes a feature called Series Link, which lets the viewer choose to record all future episodes in a given television series (availability is limited to certain programmes). Foxtel iQ also allows viewers to use live rewind and pause features during television programmes. Two new services, On Demand and Remote Record, launched in 2007. Remote Record was launched on 1 January 2007 and allows users to log into the interactive TV guide on the Foxtel website and then command their iQ at home to record shows, while on Demand was launched on 8 February 2007. This service is based on [[Sky+]], which was launched on News Corporation's UK television platform [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] in 2001.
There are currently two models of Foxtel iQ, with identical functionality to the user but different audio-visual output abilities. Both models have two tuners, allowing users to record two programs (or record one and watch one) simultaneously.
Pace plc are the set top box provider for iQ, of which they claim that the cable version of iQ is the first [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]]-based cable [[digital video recorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pace to Launch World's First DVB Cable PDR for payTV|url=http://www.pace.com/universal/news-events/press-releases/2005/pace-to-launch-worlds-first-dvb-cable-pdr-for-paytv/|publisher=[[Pace plc]]|date=21 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The updated version of the original iQ unit is physically smaller, however allows for better quality recordings and HDMI up-scaling as well as an Ethernet Port to allow Box Office downloads and it can also order On Demand titles without the need of the phone line connected to the model.  Within Foxtel and Telstra, these boxes are referred to as iQ 1.5 to differentiate them from the original IQ boxes. As of 1 March 2017, These Boxes Are No Longer Available to new Customers.

===Foxtel iQ2===
Foxtel's second generation iQ, the Foxtel iQ2 was launched alongside the Foxtel HD+ service in mid-2008. Equipped with a 320GB HDD, iQ2 is capable of recording 30 hours of HD and 90 hours of SD content and offers, double that of the original iQ. The unit also offers [[HDMI]] connectivity.&lt;ref name="foxteliqhd"&gt;{{cite web|title=FOXTEL HDTV – Watch Foxtel in high definition HD TV|url=http://www.foxtel.com.au/discover/products-features/hd/default.htm|publisher=Foxtel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iQHD is equipped with four tuners, allowing users to record two programs at once while watching a third live. The fourth tuner is reserved for on demand content.

As of 2011, 75 percent of Foxtel subscribers are using an iQ series unit, 40 percent are using Multi-Room, and 40% are using iQ2 (and therefore, HD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yourmortgage.com.au/article/do-you-need-pay-tv-122624.aspx |title=Do You Need Pay TV? |last=Sweeney |first=Nila |website=Your Mortgage |publisher=Audited Media |accessdate=2014-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 November 2011, Foxtel started notifying subscribers of the option to upgrade (at an additional one-off $200 upgrade fee) to the  new iQHD 1TB model with 4 times the recording capacity.

===Foxtel iQ3===
Foxtel's third generation iQ model, iQ3, was first referenced by CEO Richard Freudenstein in March 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astra.org.au/ArticleDocuments/229/ASTRA2012Conference_FOXTELRF_22_03_2012_11.50AM.pdf.aspx |title=ASTRA 2012 conference |date= |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322225850/http://www.astra.org.au/ArticleDocuments/229/ASTRA2012Conference_FOXTELRF_22_03_2012_11.50AM.pdf.aspx |archivedate=22 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released to customers on 23 March 2015. The iQ3 contains increased internet connectivity with the inclusion of WiFi, the ability to rewind to the beginning of a program midway through a program even if the viewer was not viewing the channel at the time of the start of the program. The iQ3 includes a 1TB HDD (3x the capacity of the previous iQHD) and a bluetooth remote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foxtel’s new set-top box to redefine how TV lovers enjoy entertainment|url=http://community.foxtel.com.au/t5/Announcements/The-ingenious-Foxtel-iQ3-launches-today/m-p/53890#U53890|publisher=Foxtel}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release, many customers had complaints due to the unstable nature of the iQ3 graphical user interface and have accused Foxtel of releasing an 'unfinished product'. Foxtel denied such claims as newfound market rival [[Netflix]] emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://mumbrella.com.au/foxtel-denies-rushing-out-iq3-becuase-of-netflix-despite-admitting-200000-boxes-need-upgrades-285097|title = Foxtel denies rushing out iQ3 because of Netflix despite 2,000 shipped boxes need upgrades|last = Christensen|first = Nic|date = 1 April 2015|work = mumbrella.com.au|access-date = 1 October 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2015, instability issues are yet to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/foxtel-iq3-backlash-continues-with-claims-150-product-is-a-work-in-progress-20150806-git6eb.html|title = Foxtel iQ3 backlash continues with claims $150 product is a 'work in progress'|last = Francis|first = Hannah|date = 7 August 2015|work = smh.com.au|access-date = 1 October 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/major-software-bugs-plague-foxtels-netflix-rival-iq3-causing-customer-outrage-20150331-1mccy9.html|title = Major software bugs plague Foxtel's Netflix rival iQ3, causing customer outrage|last = Grubb|first = Ben|date = 2 April 2015|work = smh.com.au|access-date = 1 October 2015|via = |newspaper = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Foxtel iQ4===
Foxtel's fourth generation iQ model, iQ4 was launched in August 2018 and is 4K compatible. Foxtel launched Foxtel 4K, a dedicated 4K channel on October 7th 2018, with the broadcast of the Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/foxtel-launched-4k-channel-in-preparation-for-cricket-20180814-p4zxgg.html|title=Foxtel to launch 4K channel in preparation for cricket|last=Duke|first=Jennifer|date=14 August 2018|work=[[The Age]]|access-date=26 September 2018|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising on Foxtel==
When Foxtel was launched in 1995, advertising during programs was banned under Australian Government legislation for the first two years. Foxtel has since significantly increased advertising across its platform, although still today legislation prevents Foxtel and other pay TV businesses from earning more than 50% of their revenue from advertising, sometimes viewers are exposed to up to 5min worth of adverts for every 8 minutes of programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giving the new media puzzle a sporting chance|url=http://www.foxtel.com.au/about-foxtel/ceo-speeches/giving-the-new-media-puzzle-a-sporting-chance-45801.htm|publisher=Foxtel|date=12 September 2006|access-date=12 March 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621113048/http://www.foxtel.com.au/about-foxtel/ceo-speeches/giving-the-new-media-puzzle-a-sporting-chance-45801.htm|archive-date=21 June 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain programming on select channels are broadcast commercial-free such as movies on their movie channels and selected games on Fox Sports{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} but in-between each program Foxtel would then stream many ads giving a long time between the end of one movie and the start of the next.

==Marketing==

===EOFYS===
EOFYS (pronounced \ 'E o f\os'{{clarify|date=January 2016}}) is an acronym originating from Australia referring to an "End of [[Fiscal year#Australia|Financial Year]] Sale". Its first use was in a 2009 Foxtel advertising campaign created by [[Three Drunk Monkeys]]. Since the Foxtel advertisement, other Australian businesses and advertising firms{{which|date=October 2013}} have taken licence to adopt the term, and it has become an acceptable part of the [[Australian English vocabulary|Australian lexicon]]{{dubious|date=January 2016}} and verbal nomenclature referring to businesses offerings before the Australian financial year end on 30 June.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Legislation affecting Foxtel==

===Anti-siphoning===
The Australian [[Anti-siphoning laws in Australia|anti-siphoning laws]] also prevent Foxtel and other pay TV suppliers from acquiring exclusive rights to specific sporting events such as cricket, golf, tennis and the football codes. Under the legislation pay TV licensees are prevented from bidding for major sporting events until a right is acquired by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]], [[Special Broadcasting Service|SBS]] or a free-to-air commercial network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-siphoning and anti-hoarding|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/television/antisiphoning_and_antihoarding|publisher=[[Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy]] (DBCDE)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227014537/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/television/antisiphoning_and_antihoarding|archivedate=27 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Minister for Communications announced a review of the legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sport on Television – Review of the anti-siphoning scheme|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/television/antisiphoning_and_antihoarding/sport_on_television_review_of_the_antisiphoning_scheme|publisher=Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy (DBCDE)|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091220180406/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/television/antisiphoning_and_antihoarding/sport_on_television_review_of_the_antisiphoning_scheme|archivedate=20 December 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an Olympics year, the Australian anti-siphoning list runs to over 1300 events and is one of the longest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foxtel submission on discussion paper|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/121320/Foxtel_main_submission.pdf|publisher=Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|date=16 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120228041513/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/121320/Foxtel_main_submission.pdf|archivedate=28 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third party access==
Foxtel prevents users from using their subscription card in a third-party decoder, and requires all users to watch the service on a supplied set-top box, included with the subscription, however some users have reported being able to watch certain channels on a computer with a DVB-C card and using sasc-ng to decrypt the video content using card readers to read the decoding keys stored on the card used in Foxtel's iQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Getting Pay TV to Work With MythTV|url=http://omcentre.com.au/Getting-Pay-TV-to-Work-With-MythTV.102.0.html|publisher=Open Media Centre|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916144818/http://www.omcentre.com.au/Getting-Pay-TV-to-Work-With-MythTV.102.0.html|archivedate=16 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foxtel Networks==
On 24 May 2012, Foxtel merged with [[Austar]], resulting in Foxtel gaining Austar's shares in [[XYZnetworks]] (which Foxtel closed and created Foxtel Networks), as well as their shares in Main Event.&lt;ref name="Foxtel-Austar Merger Complete"&gt;

GPS when applied in the earthmoving industry can be a viable asset to contractors and increase the overall efficiency of the job.  Since GPS satellite positioning information is free to the public, it allows for everyone to take advantage of its uses.  [[Engineering vehicle|Heavy equipment]] manufacturers in conjunction with GPS [[guidance system]] manufacturers have been co-developing GPS guidance systems for heavy equipment since the late 1990s.  These systems allow the equipment operator to use GPS position data to make decisions based on actual grade and design features.  Some heavy equipment guidance systems can even operate the machine's implements automatically from a set design that was created for the particular jobsite.  GPS guidance systems can have tolerances as small as two to three centimeters making them extremely accurate compared to relying on the operator's skill level.  Since the machine's GPS system has the ability to know when it's off the design grade, this can reduce surveying and material costs required for a specific job.

==History==
GPS Technology was officially introduced as a guidance system for earthmoving machines in the late 1990s.  Since this time, many manufacturers of earthmoving equipment now offer GPS and other guidance systems, as a factory option.  Many companies exist that also sell GPS guidance systems for the earthmoving industry as a retrofit option.  The two main companies for heavy equipment guidance systems are Trimble and Topcon.  In April 2002, Trimble and Caterpillar Inc. began a joint venture known as Caterpillar Trimble Controls Technology LLC (CTCT).  "The joint venture develops [[machine control]] products that use site design information combined with accurate positioning technology to automatically control dozer blades and other machine tools".&lt;ref&gt;Trimble. (2008). Trimble: The Construction Technology Authority. Article: Trimble.com  Retrieved March 11, 2009 from http://www.trimble-productivity.com/articles/95?page=3{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though aftermarket kits were available from various companies to retrofit an existing machine for GPS guidance, Caterpillar Inc. was the first heavy equipment manufacturer to offer GPS guidance systems as a factory option from the dealer called an ARO (Attachment Ready Option).&lt;ref&gt;Caterpillar Inc. (2003). AccuGrade GPS. Article: Cat.com.  Retrieved March 14, 2009 from http://www.cat.com/cda/components/fullArticleNoNav?ids=113001&amp;languageId=7&lt;/ref&gt;   [[John Deere]] soon followed with their own version of ARO called "Integrated Grade Control" in 2006 on many Track-Type Tractors (TTT) and Motorgraders (MG).&lt;ref&gt;John Deere (2008). Deere Supports Dozer Customers With Innovative Offerings. Article: John Deere.com.  Retrieved March 11, 2009 from http://www.deere.com/en_US/cfd/construction/deere_const/newsroom/2008/080312_dozer_support.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
While there are various GPS systems currently used in the heavy equipment industry, they can typically be categorized as either "indicate only" or "fully automatic".&lt;ref name="equipmentworldmagazine.com"&gt;Jackson, T. (2008). Technology: GPS by the numbers. Article: Equipment World. Retrieved March 11, 2009 from http://www.equipmentworldmagazine.com/apps/news/articleeqw.asp?id=66334&lt;/ref&gt;  Both systems can utilize one or two GPS receivers.  Using only one [[GPS receiver]] limits how the guidance system can orient the machine's position in respect to the site design.  Using two GPS receivers gives the guidance system two points of position allowing it to calculate what angle the machine is on relative to the site plan.  The following describes "indicate only" and "fully automatic" in more detail.

==Indicate only==
Indicate only uses GPS positioning information as a guide to the operator.  Depending on the system used, the machine position can be displayed over the specific design site that was created for the earthmoving project.  This system relies on the operator to steer and move the machine's implements in order to match the site's design.  Indicate only systems are typically cheaper and less complicated since they don't require hardware to tap into the machine's implement [[control system]]s.  Indicate only systems typically utilize a single GPS receiver mounted on the machine itself and can use an angle sensor to calculate the machine's slope.  Accuracy of these systems depends on if the site has a [[base station]] that can relay site specific corrections.  If the site does not have a base station, indicate only systems can just use satellite information, however the accuracy is usually in the one to two meter range.  Utilizing a base station allows for site specific corrections to be transmitted to the machine, increasing the accuracy through Real Time Kinematics&lt;ref&gt;"Real Time Kinematics is a technique used in [[Surveying|land survey]] and in [[hydrographic survey]] based on the use of carrier phase measurements of the GPS, [[GLONASS]] and/or Galileo signals where a single reference station provides the real-time corrections of even to a centimetre level of accuracy" (Wikipedia, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; (RTK).  Site specific corrections can increase the accuracy of an indicate only system to be around two to three centimeters.  Machines that typically use indicate only consist of Soil Compactors (SC), Track-Type Tractors (TTT), and Motor Graders (MG).  The use of a base station really depends on the accuracy requirements of the project.  Some projects such as clearing overburden at a mine site with a TTT, may not need two to three centimeter accuracy while as grading a road base with a MG does.

==Fully automatic==
Fully automatic systems allow the ability of the machine's implements to be controlled by the GPS guidance system.  This is typically used in the fine grading applications where precise levels of material need to be moved on a predetermined design or grade.  The advantages to this system is due to the accuracy that can be achieved with GPS and RTK, but requires an onsite base station.  These systems can use either one or two GPS receivers and are mounted on the machine's blade.  The more advanced systems use two receivers since it allows the machine to be controlled in a three-dimensional design.  Fully automatic systems require the GPS guidance system to be integrated in the machine's implement controls.  Some manufacturers sell the machine with these controls already integrated into the machine as an option.  Aftermarket kits are available that can retrofit your existing machine to fully automatic control, but requires the GPS system to interface with the machine's implement controls.  This is typically done one of two ways.  If the machine's implements are controlled using electric over hydraulic (EH), the GPS system can input lever commands in parallel with the machine's implement lever.  The output from the GPS system is interpreted by the machine's [[Electronic control unit|electronic control module]] as a lever command given by the operator and moves the implements accordingly.  The second method for integrating GPS in the machine's implement controls is by adding a second pilot hydraulic valve in parallel with the machine's pilot hydraulic valve.  This second valve is controlled by the GPS system and moves the implement valve according to the system design and blade location.     Types of machines that use fully automatic GPS systems include TTT and MG.

==Applications==
The key to successfully using GPS in the earthmoving industry is having an accurate site design.  The site design, typically created by an engineering firm, can be imported from the original design file into the machine's GPS display.  Most GPS guidance systems also have the ability to allow the operator to define a specific grade elevation or grade angle without a specific design.  The following describes common machine applications that utilize GPS guidance systems.

Track-Type Tractors
TTT are an extremely popular machine platform for GPS guidance systems specifically in the smaller sized models that are used for fine grading.  Caterpillar Inc. and John Deere both offer fully automatic integrated GPS as an option from the factory on some of these models.  One example of GPS being used on a TTT would be on a road project.

===Motorgraders===
Motorgraders are another popular machine platform since they also perform fine grading activities that can benefit from the GPS accuracy.  Caterpillar Inc. and John Deere also offer some models with integrated GPS.

===Hydraulic Excavators===
Hydraulic excavators are just beginning to be integrated using GPS technology and are typically indicate only.  Excavators use GPS technology in conjunction with angle sensors integrated in the machine's boom, stick, and bucket.  This allows the operator to see how deep they are digging by comparing the actual bucket location to the site design on the GPS display.
In recent years, Komatsu has released excavators offering semi-automatic functions. With these functions, the machine will automatically raise the boom and bucket to maintain the predetermined design grade. These machines also offer an auto stop function, preventing the bucket and boom function from lower beyond the predetermined design grade. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0ELceB420I

===Scrapers===
Scrapers use GPS technology and are typically indicate only.  The GPS antenna is typically mounted on the bowl of the scraper and allows the operator to compare the depth of the cut versus the site plan.  This takes a lot of the ambiguity out of moving large amounts of material.

===Compactors===
GPS technology is applied in both trash compactors and soil compactors.  Typical systems record where the compactor has been in order to create a map of the area's compaction.  Usually the display has various colors that indicate that the machine has compacted the area.

==Financial Information==
GPS systems typically have a high initial cost of around $100,000 per machine.  When used properly GPS on average can increase productivity by as much as 30% over traditional methods.  There is also cost reduction of material (since less is needed) because such high accuracy can be achieved.  Some construction projects even require the use of GPS since it can bring down the overall cost of the project due to its efficiency advantages.  Some GPS systems allow the user to switch systems to other machines making this tool very versatile.  The contractor must plan for greater efficiency, since increasing one aspect of the job by 30% may not increase the overall efficiency, since another area may not be able to keep up.  "If you do everything right and boost overall productivity say 30 percent, you’re going to have to line up 30 percent more work in the future or send crews home early".&lt;ref name="equipmentworldmagazine.com"/&gt;

==GPS Limitations==
GPS is extremely versatile in the earthmoving industry but it does have its limitations.  GPS satellite signals can only be received in a non obstructed view of the sky with the exception of clouds.  If a contractor wanted to perform grade work in preparation for a concrete floor within a building for example, the roof would block the view to the GPS satellites preventing the system from working.  Working too close to a structure can also obstruct the machine's view of the sky creating dead zones.  High-voltage power-lines can also create dead zones when working underneath them.  GPS satellite coverage can also be weaker during certain parts of the day lowering the amount of satellites the machine's system can use.  This all depends on the [[Location (geography)|geographical location]] and time of day.  Improvements in GPS technology and the addition of GLONASS (Russian GNSS Satellites) satellites have reduced this issue.  As mentioned earlier, in order to increase the overall accuracy of GPS you have to purchase and use a base station which adds additional cost.

==Future use==
GPS continues to be integrated in the [[Construction|construction industry]] and soon will be an [[Standardization|industry standard]].  Autonomous cars that utilize GPS are currently being developed and someday the earthmoving industry could incorporate such features.   Already new machines are coming equipped with GPS integrated from the factory.  The possibilities are endless and who knows what other practical uses for GPS in the earthmoving industries will be discovered.

==Resources==
2010 saw the advent of the first user-oriented web resource for prospective 3D machine control users. The Kellogg Report&lt;ref&gt;The Kellogg Report LLC (2010). Article: The Kellogg Report.  Retrieved December 15, 2010 from http://www.kelloggreport.com/index.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; publicized a detailed comparison of the major systems available on the market, evaluating more than 200 system features. The report continues to be updated as the technology evolves.

'''iSight GPS''' vehicle tracking systems were introduced by [[RFTrax]] in June 2008 to provide consumers and small businesses inexpensive real-time vehicle [[GPS]] using RFTrax asset tracking technologies. The iSight-CT model was designed for parents to monitor their most valuable and often at risk asset; their teenage drivers. A simple under-dash or windshield-mounted device transmits the car’s location, speed and direction every 30 seconds to a secure database via the [[GSM]] cellular network. The data can be viewed and mapped in real time from any internet enabled computer using a secure login to the company’s proprietary web site. Parents can set speed limits and establish [[geofence]]s that can deliver [[email]] or [[Short message service|SMS]] text message notices when guidelines they have established with their young drivers have been stretched.

'''Intelsat 502''', previously named '''Intelsat V F-2''', was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]]. Launched in 1980, it was the second of fifteen [[Intelsat VI]] satellites to be launched. The Intelsat V series was constructed by [[Ford Aerospace]], based on the [[Spacebus|Intelsat-V]] [[satellite bus]].

Intelsat V F-2 was part of an advanced series of satellites designed to provide greater [[telecommunications]] capacity for [[Intelsat]]'s global network. The satellite was deactivated on April 14, 1998.

The satellite was successfully launched into space on December 6, 1980, at 23:31 UTC, by means of an [[Atlas-Centaur|Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1AR]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 1,928&amp;nbsp;kg. The Intelsat 502 was equipped with 4 [[Ku-band]] transponders more 21 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] [[transponder]]s for 12,000 audio circuits and 2 TV channels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6872">The '''International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements''' ('''ICRU''') is a standardization body set up in 1925 by the International Congress of Radiology, originally as the '''X-Ray Unit Committee''' until 1950. Its objective "is to develop concepts, definitions and recommendations for the use of [[physical quantity|quantities]] and their [[physical unit|unit]]s for [[radiation|ionizing radiation]] and its interaction with matter, in particular with respect to the biological effects induced by radiation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

The ICRU is a sister organisation to the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP). In general terms the ICRU defines the units, and the ICRP recommends how they are used for [[radiation protection]].

==Development==
During the first two decades of its existence, its formal meetings were held during the International Congress of Radiology, but from 1950 onwards, when its mandate was extended, it has met annually. 

Until 1953, the president of the ICRU was a national of the country that was hosting the ICR, but in that year it was decided to elect a permanent commission - the first permanent chairman being [[Lauriston S. Taylor]] who had been a member of the commission since 1928 and secretary since 1934.  Taylor served until 1969 and on his retirement was accorded the position of honorary chairman which we held until his death in 2004, aged 102.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.icrp.org/page.asp?id=92
|title = Emeritus and founder member L S Taylor dies
|date = 1 December 2004
|publisher = International Commission on Radiological Protection
|accessdate = 18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s the ICRU was invited by the CGPM to join other scientific bodies to work with the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) in the development of a system of units that could be used consistently over many disciplines.  This body, initially known as the "Commission for the System of Units" (renamed in 1964 as the "Consultative Committee for Units") was responsible overseeing the development of the [[International System of Units]] (SI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.bipm.org/en/committees/cc/ccu/
|title = CCU: Consultative Committee for Units
|publisher = [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM)
|accessdate = 18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1950s the ICRU started publishing reports on an irregular basis - on average two to three a year.  In 2001 the publication cycle was regularised and reports are now published bi-annually under the banner "Journal of the ICRU".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = Journal of the ICRU
|accessdate = 3 June 2012
|year = 2012
|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current operation==
The commission has a maximum of fifteen members who serve for four years and who, since 1950, have been nominated by the  incumbent commissioners. Members are selected for their scientific ability and is widely regarded as the foremost
panel of experts in radiation medicine and in the other fields of ICRU endeavor. The commission is funded by the sale of reports, by grants from the [[European Commission]], the [[National Cancer Institute|US National Cancer Institute]] and the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and indirectly by organisations and companies who provide meeting venues.  Commissioners, many of whom have full-time university or research centre appointments, have their expenses reimbursed, but otherwise they receive no remuneration from the ICRU. 

==Radiation quantities==
[[File:Dose_quantities_and_units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry based on ICRU 57, jointly developed with the ICRP]]
The commission has been responsible for defining and introducing many of the following units of measure.  The number of different units for various quantities is indicative of changes of thinking in world metrology, especially the movement from [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|cgs]] to [[International System of Units|SI]] units.&lt;ref name = ICRUHistory&gt;{{cite web

The following table shows radiation quantities in SI and non-SI units.

{{Radiation related quantities}}
Although the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission permits the use of the units [[curie]], rad, and [[rem (unit)|rem]] alongside SI units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1004|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1004.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[European Union]] [[European units of measurement directives]] required that their use for "public health ... purposes" be phased out by 31 December 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Rusanda''' is the name of a '''Lake Rusanda''' (Jezero Rusanda), a highly [[saline water|saline]], shallow [[wetland]], and also a [[spa town]] of Rusanda ('''Banja Rusanda'''), in [[Melenci]], [[Zrenjanin]], [[Serbia]]. Belgrade is to the south. The spa was founded in 1867.

== Geography ==

Due to the high salinity of both the water and the mud, up to 60%, it has been speculated that Rusanda is one of the remnants of the ancient [[Pannonian Sea]], but the lake is probably a fossil bed of the [[Tisza]] river. Records show that healing mud from the lake's bottom, [[peloid]], has been used for therapeutic treatments at least since the 1760s. Mud therapy proved to be quite beneficial with [[muscle inflammation]], [[rheumatism]], [[gout]] and especially with the car crash injuries.&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author = Đuro Đukić | title = Lažna uzbuna zbog iščezlog jezera u Melencima| newspaper = [[Politika]] | pages = 14 | language = Serbian | date = 9 August 2017 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 a complete drying out of the lake gained media attention. It was reported of the ecological catastrophe which endangered the local population, agriculture (vineyards, orchards) and 200 bird species living in the lake area, due to the toxic saline dusts blown by the winds. Also, the mud dries and can't be used, while the Sun damages both the peloid's quality and quantity.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;&lt;ref name=noiz&gt;{{cite web|url= http://noizz.rs/noizz-news/presusilo-najvece-slano-jezero-u-srbiji/155q2xq?dr=blic.rs/svet |author=Miloš Ljuna |title= Presušilo najveće slano jezero u Srbiji |date=6 August 2017 |publisher=Noizz |language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hydrologists however said that drying of the lake is not unusual, it happens occasionally (like in the mid-2000s) without disrupting the ecosystem, but it didn't gain as much media attention previously. When the rainy season starts, the lake will fill up again.&lt;ref name=noiz/&gt; It happens due to the dry summers and possibly because of the disturbance of the level of underground waters, caused with the construction of the [[Danube–Tisa–Danube Canal]]. In order to prevent this, hydrological research was conducted in the early 2010s, and the plan was made to dig several water wells which would prevent the lake from drying up during the periods of drought. The wells were built but apparently are not functioning yet. Still, the experts warned that the irrigation of the lake may disturb the natural balance and influence the medicinal properties of the mud so that best thing would be to let the nature regulate the lake, as it is.&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

Peloid indeed can't be used when it dries and hardens, but the spa, organized as the Special hospital for rehabilitation "Rusanda", always has stored quantities of it, in cases the complete drying up happens. To change the properties of the mud, the drought would have to last much longer, at least a 1,000 years, and one dry season is not nearly enough. The layers of mud are actually sediments of sand clay. The chemical composition: dominant are [[silicon dioxide]], [[aluminium oxide]] and [[iron oxide]], with other [[oxides]], [[microelements]] and a significant amount of total [[sulfur]]. The lake was declared a [[Nature park]] "Rusanda".&lt;ref name="Politika"/&gt;

The company has a head office in [[Melbourne]], Australia, and its parent company Strong Technologies bases its operations in the Middle East and Africa.

== Personal Video Recorder ==
Strong Australia produces PVRs for [[High-definition television|standard- and high-definition]] television program recording. The PVRs store the digital files in a container-format with the .TS [[file extension]] on their hard-disk drives or on external drives via [[USB]]; software updates are provided on their website which include fixes and improvements on both previous and current models.

== Media Players ==
Since 2012, Strong Australia have been introducing Android-based media players to the [[Australia]]n retail market in the form of [[set-top box|set top boxes]]. Beginning with the SRT AN4, this was the first media player available in the Australian market with an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] based operating system running [[Android Ice Cream Sandwich|Ice Cream Sandwich]] which also included a [[DVB-T2]] terrestrial tuner for the viewing of live television. The SRT AN4M model is the same without including the [[DVB-T2]] tuner. Both units use a [[Telechips|Telechips TCC892x]] CPU with 1GB of RAM, two [[USB|USB 2.0 ports]], a coaxial audio out port for digital audio output and one HDMI output.

== Rock-Box ==

[[Rock-Box]] is the name of Strong Australia's more recent Android media player series, with two different models including the SRT RB2 and SRT RB4. Both models run [[Android Jelly Bean|Android 4.2 Jelly Bean]] and use [[Rockchip|Rockchip RK3066 and RK3188 processors]], a selection of dual and quad core chips relating to the names of the Rock-Box model numbers (SRT RB2 - Dual core, SRT RB-4 - Quad core).

The key differences between the SRT RB2 and SRT RB4 along with their chipset differences are as follows:

*SRT RB2 has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of [[Flash memory#NAND flash|NAND]] storage
*SRT RB4 has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of [[Flash memory#NAND flash|NAND]] storage

Both models use the same [[Mali (GPU)|Mali-400 GPU]] although the GPU inside the SRT RB4 is clocked slightly higher as a result of the quad core processor. [[Wi-Fi|2.4GHz Wi-Fi]] with external antenna, [[Bluetooth]], [[Secure Digital#Micro|MicroSD]] card reader and four [[USB|USB 2.0 ports]] make it a suitable media player for different applications and will accept common external hard drives with formats including but not limited to [[File Allocation Table#FAT32|FAT 32]] and [[NTFS]] as well as USB mice or keyboards, both wired and wireless.

These products come with the stock Android applications installed as well as the [[Netflix]], [[Hulu]] and [[Kodi (software)|XBMC]] applications. There is no skin or aesthetic changes on the version of Android in place on the Rock-Box products so it is a pure image of Android with minor tweaks for the set top box format.
